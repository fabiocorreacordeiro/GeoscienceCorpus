In recent years, engineering geologists have been able to leverage light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology with automated change detection and clustering workflows, for spatially accurate rockfall monitoring and inventorization. This wealth of digital data generates new research prospects for the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system able to analyze change detection sequences and map spatio-temporal rockfall patterns by precisely capturing the rock slope evolution in near-real-time. However, prerequisite to such an advancement is the need to efficiently automate the process of classifying surface changes corresponding to rockfall. This task typically requires intensive human effort and is prone to multiple sources of human error like subjectivity, expertise, and experience that may differ from person to person involved in a particular project. This paper investigates the potential of integrating sophisticated deep learning architectures into dynamic rockfall database population processes, with the goal of relieving experts from the daunting task of manually classifying rockfall events within large loads of change detection data. Deep neural networks based on the pioneering PointNet and PointNet++ architectures for 3D point cloud learning are developed for this purpose based on a 5-year change detection database consisting of >8000 rock slope clusters of identified change for training, with scanning intervals ranging from 5\u00a0days to 6\u00a0months. The models are tested on the 536 clusters from the two last data acquisitions to simulate the real monitoring situation and subsequently on the most frequent of the campaigns to increase the probability of working with single-event clusters. The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of about 89% and 84% on the last and shortest campaign, respectively. The optimized deep learning models are further evaluated on a geologically different rockfall database achieving almost 93% accuracy in a location where discrete geomorphologic features such as steep rock outcrops and erosion channels are present. The study shows that although it is challenging to achieve generalization in rockfall detection, site-specific training of the proposed deep learning architecture can lead to high-level performance and support further advancements in rockfall risk management.\n               ","1":"\n                  This technical note investigates the shear behavior of loess using a specifically designed triaxial test scheme, in which five different drainage conditions of loess were controlled by a strain increment ratio (d\u03b5\n                     \n                        v\n                     \/d\u03b5\n                     \n                        a\n                     ) in the shear stage. It was established that with an increase in the strain increment ratio, the behavior of the loess samples changed from strain-softening to strain-hardening behaviors in the triaxial test. When d\u03b5\n                     \n                        v\n                     \/d\u03b5\n                     \n                        a\n                      was less than zero, a strong contractive strain-softening behavior was revealed with a large collapsibility index. In the shear stage of a partially drained condition, the loess sample yielded a \u2018limited flow\u2019 behavior, which was marked by an occurrence of phase transformation from contractive to dilative response in the q-p\u2019 diagram. More importantly, a unique relationship between the strain increment ratio and stress ratio (q\/p\u2019) was established for the test materials. The experimental results suggest a pressing need to thoroughly consider the drainage conditions of loess and the associated impacts on shear.\n               ","2":"\n                  This study focuses on the vibrational response of a landslide mass to natural and man-induced vibrations. The landslide is located in the Molise region (Italy) and involves a coastal slope extending approximately 5\u00a0km2, from the Petacciato village to the coastline. The landslide activity is well documented since 1909 with historical reactivations and resulted in severe damage to infrastructure and to the ancient village. This activity is characterised by a roto-translational mechanism involving blue clays, sands, and conglomerates of Pleistocene age. A multitemporal geomorphological analysis of the landslide activity allowed us to detect a retrogressive style corresponding to the crown area as well as a prograding toe that reaches the submerged nearshore. Seismic ambient noise measurements revealed that the local seismic amplification is strictly concentrated in the back-crown area, i.e., the area affected by the most recent retrogressive effects of the landslide mass. Moreover, ground vibrations generated by train transits were analysed to identify possible amplification phenomena of dynamic external input, that can occur inside the landslide mass with respect to the surrounding area. Therefore, a Spectral Aggravation Index (SAI) was defined by the ratio between the Fourier spectrum during train transit and that obtained for an equal time window in the absence of train traffic sources. The SAI was applied to compare the response to man-induced vibrations inside the landslide mass with the one outside, by computing a ratio of the SAI at different measurement points inside\/outside the landslide mass. The obtained results highlight the intense activity of the landslide both in space and time, revealing a joining between the ongoing retreat areas, surveyed by multitemporal geomorphological analysis, and local seismic response, by geophysical investigations. On the other hand, most of the landslide mass from the middle- to downslope position is not resonant and its higher damping causes a lower intensity of ground motion in response to man-induced vibrations with respect to the surrounding areas.\n               ","3":"\n                  Rockfall causes a large number of accidents and fatalities in steep environments. A realistic quantification of rockfall risk is thus crucial for an effective prevention of damages and loss of lives. The estimation of rockfall and block volumes for different return periods thereby remains a major challenge. In this paper, we present a straightforward rockfall frequency model (RFM: Rockfall Frequency Model) and its application at 8 different sites at 7 locations in the Swiss Alps. The RFM assumes that the magnitude-frequency relationships of rockfall events and blocks follow a power law. The parameters of this distribution are estimated based on a simple classification of rock structures and on field inventories. Beside the block volume frequency, which is very sensitive to the consideration of large rockfall events, the frequency of rockfalls with at least one block with a minimum volume, is determined. The block size distributions measured in this study were well captured by power laws. The rockfall and block volumes calculated with the RFM were generally slightly higher than the scenarios of the official hazard assessments. The uncertainty analysis, however, revealed a high variability of the release scenarios with respect to the parameters of the RFM, increasing with the return period. Both, the rockfall volumes and the block volumes, are particularly sensitive to the estimated exponent of the power law distribution of the rockfall events. Nevertheless, the proposed RFM provides an objective and transparent approach to derive magnitude-frequency relationships of rockfall events and individual blocks even if historical inventories are missing or insufficient and is thus a promising alternative to merely expert-based approaches.\n               ","4":"\n                  Landslide monitoring data are characterized by scatter that can make the velocity and acceleration of a landslide unclear. The presence of scatter can therefore influence the reliability of an early warning system (EWS) too. Data filters such as simple moving average (SMA) are commonly used to reduce scatter in the data and enhance the reliability of EWSs. Therefore, evaluating the adequacy of these filters to reproduce displacement characteristics representative of the landslide is important. Gaussian-weighted moving average (GWMA) and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filters are examined here against SMA. To this aim, a comprehensive numerical analysis of a synthetic database was carried out on accelerating scenarios to quantify the reliability of each filter to detect the onset of acceleration and forecast the failure time using the inverse velocity method. GWMA and SG applications in the synthetic scenarios reached reliability thresholds of 90% at 30% and 4% of the corresponding time by SMA, respectively, and provided a timelier capture of moment patterns. Specifically, these synthetic cases show the application of GMWA and SG improves failure time forecasting by 60 to 80% and 90 to 100%, respectively, compared to SMA depending on the amount of data used by the filter and the remaining time to failure. Additionally, nine failed cases (17 datasets) from the literature were examined after employing these three filters. Results of these cases show using alternatives to SMA would increase the accuracy of failure time forecasts by 60%.\n               ","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"\n                  A full understanding of the interaction mechanisms among flow-like landslides and impacted protection structures is still an open issue. Although several approaches, from experimental to numerical, have been used so far, a thoroughly assessment of the hydromechanical behaviour of the landslide body is achievable only through a multiphase and large deformation approach.\n                  This paper firstly proposes a conceptual model for a specific type of protection structure, namely a Deformable Geosynthetics-Reinforced Barrier (DGRB), i.e., an embankment made of coarse-grained soil layers reinforced by geogrids. In such a case, the sliding of the barrier along its base, under the impulsive action of a flow-type landslide, is an important landslide energy dissipation mechanism, and a key issue for the design. Then, two different approaches are proposed: i) an advanced hydro-mechanical numerical model based on Material Point Method is tested in simulating the whole complex landslide-structure interaction mechanisms, ii) an analytical model is set up to deal with the landslide energy dissipation and the kinematics of both the landslide and barrier. The calibration of the proposed analytical model is pursued based on the numerical results. Finally, the analytical model is successfully validated to interpret a large dataset of landslide impact field evidence, for whose interpretation also five empirical methods available in the literature are tested.\n               ","10":"\n                  Shale gas is becoming a new energy development focus worldwide with advances in horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing, and spontaneous water-based working fluid imbibition is one of the strongest phenomena that can impact borehole stability and the gas extraction rate. Our present experimental work was carried out on shale Brazilian discs with 5 different bedding orientations (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0) after air-drying and spontaneous water imbibition using a split Hopkinson pressure bar. The results illustrate that under the same loading rate (100\u2013900 GPa\/s), spontaneous water imbibition obviously weakens the dynamic tensile strength of shale discs, except for shale discs with a bedding orientation of 90\u00b0 when the loading rate exceeds 400 GPa\/s, and does not change the anisotropic dynamic tensile strength variation trend versus bedding orientations. Models that can well fit test data and reveal the coupling effects of bedding orientation and loading rate on the dynamic tensile strength of shale after air-drying and spontaneous water imbibition are proposed. The rate-dependent failure mode only appears among shale discs with bedding orientations of 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and this phenomenon is exacerbated and more complex after spontaneous water imbibition. Bedding planes of shale discs after air-drying and spontaneous water imbibition both play three different roles in affecting the failure crack propagation, i.e., intersecting propagation, promoting propagation and promoting turning. Finally, the dynamic tensile strength responses of shale after spontaneous water imbibition are analyzed and discussed, and potential field applications in borehole stability, perforation design and hydraulic fracturing are suggested.\n               ","11":"\n                  The residual strength of sliding basal soils plays a pivotal role not only in the movement of bedding landslides controlled by clay-rich interlayers but also in remobilized granular deposits. Many studies have focused on better understanding the residual shear behaviors of clayey and granular soils under relatively low shear rates. However, the residual strength varies with various clay fractions for clayey soils and fine-size fractions for granular soils, as well as shear rates (especially in fast ranges) need further examined. In the present research, results of a low- to high-rate continuous ring shear test on a clayey soil and three granular soils at the shear rates ranging from 0.5 to 50.0\u00a0mm\/s were reported. The clayey soil was remolded from the shear zone soil of a bedding landslide controlled by a clay-rich interlayer with main minerals of illite-smectite, and the granular soils included two silica sands and one mixture of silica sand with fine granite residual soil particles. The results show that saturated clayey soil has an obvious positive shear rate effect on its residual strength after a certain shear rate; the mechanism is the transformation of shear mode, i.e., from sliding shearing to turbulent shearing with the increasing of shear rate. The high clay fraction may promote this transformation of shear mode. In addition, the critical shear rate of the clayey soil that has a positive shear rate dependency of the residual strength (i.e., rate-strengthening) is related to the clay fraction, i.e., a smaller critical shear rate appears in the clayey soil with higher clay fraction. The residual strength of saturated granular soils with different fine-size fractions do not show any shear rate-dependent, while the fine-size fraction affects the residual strength both in drained and undrained conditions; that is, the higher the fine-size fraction is, the lower the residual strength is. Moreover, the neutral shear rate effect of granular soils in this study may be related to the low normal stress and low shear rate range. The authors believe that, results such as those obtained in this work, may be useful for developing a more suitable constitutive model to better understand the postfailure motion (or reactivation kinematics) of bedding landslides controlled by clay-rich interlayers, as well as rock avalanche deposits remobilized by heavy rainfall.\n               ","12":"\n                  Gas diffusivity is a crucial parameter for modeling the mass flow and transport in the fields of engineering, agriculture and environment. However, existing models were only developed for single-porosity media and underestimated the diffusivity of gas in fractured or cracked media. This study develops a fractal diffusion model of gas in unsaturated dual-porosity media. Based on statistical characteristics, the fracture length is assumed to obey the fractal law and the aperture is defined as a power function of its length. The transition regime of molecular diffusion is adopted to derive the upscaling diffusion model. The developed model considers the heterogeneity of porosity and water distribution by calibrating the relationship between local and bulk properties. 19 sets of data are used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed fractal model. The results show that in dual-porosity media, fractures will serve as preferential channels and significantly enhance gas migration. Besides, the heterogeneity distribution of water content inhibits molecular diffusion by potentially decreasing effective diffusion paths. The influence of fractures on gas diffusion is not only related to fracture volume but also to its scaling fractal dimension and other structures parameters. Finally, the superiority of the proposed fractal model can also be found from the comparison with other models.\n               ","13":"\n                  Using laminar or turbulent flow equations indiscriminately to describe groundwater flows in fracture networks may result in large errors. We propose a new method for simulating steady-state groundwater flows in two- and three-dimensional fracture networks by separating laminar flows and turbulent flows in individual fractures. Poiseuille's law is employed when the flow is laminar, while Swamee and Jain formula is utilized when the flow is turbulent. The model results are first compared to recently measured field groundwater flow data in a mining tunnel network. The effect of hydraulic gradient, aperture, fracture width in the third dimension, and fracture density is then examined. Using the laminar flow equation indiscriminately in all fractures overestimates groundwater flowrates, whereas using the turbulent flow equation underestimates them. The aperture contrast of large and small fractures has a significant impact on the potential errors of indiscriminately applying the laminar or turbulent flow equation and the flowrate difference between the three-dimensional and two-dimensional fracture networks. Total groundwater flowrates increase with fracture density in both three-dimensional and two-dimensional fracture networks, with the largest increase occurring when additional fractures are introduced parallel to the hydraulic gradient. The new approach may be utilized to estimate hydraulic head distribution and groundwater flowrate according to the crack patterns and geometric properties of the fractured rock.\n               ","14":"\n                  Landslides are major threats to the construction and operation of electric towers of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Grid Interconnection Project (STGIP). The long, narrow project corridor is vulnerable to different types of landslides, making risk management a difficult task. In this study, a kinematic-based, landslide risk management framework that includes hazard analysis, risk estimation, risk evaluation, and risk control is proposed and implemented. The spatial density of historical landslides and the spatial distribution of landslide kinematics are used to analyze landslide hazard. Kinetic energy derived from the landslide physical process model is employed to analyze the vulnerability of the towers in the risk estimation step. Then, the landslide hazard and tower vulnerability are used to comprehensively evaluate the landslide risk level of the electric towers. Electric towers with high risk are mainly situated in areas near rivers and faults, with fragile steep slopes. Fragmented rock masses and a thick regolith cover provide abundant materials for landslides, and steep slopes supply the initial conditions and energy that make them a risk. Risk-control strategies are provided based on site-specific risk. The safe construction and operation of the STGIP in the past 10\u00a0years show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed framework.

With the change of confining pressure, they can be transformed into each other. Taking one of loess as the research object, consolidated drained triaxial tests of undisturbed loess under different confining pressures are carried out. The stress-strain relationship obtained is described by the composite power exponential model (CPE model). According to the results, the critical confining pressure during the transformation of the stress-strain curve and the stress-strain relationship under a given confining pressure are predicted. The comparison with the experimental data shows that the CPE model has high accuracy in description and prediction, and the predicted critical confining pressure can correctly judge the type of stress-strain curve of undisturbed loess under different confining pressures. The predicted ideal elastic-plastic stress-strain curve and the curves under given confining pressures conform to the curve change law, which can reflect the real characteristics of loess. Finally, the stress-strain curves of coral clay, silica sand and cement mortar are described and predicted by the CPE model, and then compared with the experimental data. The high consistency between the two further verifies the wide applicability of the CPE model. It provides a method to infer the results under other conditions from a limited number of test results, which will help to correctly analyze the mechanical properties of loess, clay, sand, cement mortar and other materials in practical projects, and to be realized in numerical analysis.\n               ","16":"\n                  We propose a method for evaluating the risks of slope failure induced by heavy rain over a wide area by combining infiltration analysis, surface flow analysis, and slope stability analysis based on three-dimensional limit equilibrium method.

To determine rainfall-induced water transportation, we employ an infiltration analysis, using the Green-Ampt model, and a surface flow analysis, using the diffusion wave model. For the slope stability analysis, a three-dimensional arc-slip calculation applying the Hovland method is used. The infiltration depth is obtained from the results of the infiltration analysis, whereas the simulated data are used as input data for the slope stability analysis. A region in Kamaishi City, Iwate Prefecture, Japan, where slope failures were observed during typhoon Hagibis on October 12 and 13, 2019, is selected in this study as the target area and a series of analyses are performed. The topographical survey data by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) observed before and after the typhoon are used to identify the actual collapse locations and compare them with the results of the slope stability analysis. In addition, high-resolution topographic data of the target area using UAV data is created and differences in the factor of safety distribution with and without the UAV data for terrain data are compared and discussed. The obtained results revealed that the proposed method can roughly represent the actual slope failure, which is useful for evaluating rainfall-induced slope failure hazards.

Spatial variability is a type of uncertainty that has received more and more attention in recent years. Scale of fluctuation (SOF) is a parameter for measuring the spatial variability of soil properties. To investigate the proper method for computing the SOF of soil properties, two types of methods (auto-correlation function method (ACM), and variance reduction method (VRM)) are compared theoretically and numerically, and the influence factors, such as number of data points involved in curve fitting for the auto-correlation function (ACF) or variance reduction function (VRF) and sampling interval, on the SOFs are analyzed. To improve the accuracy of curve fitting for the ACF or VRF, a weighted least squares (WLS) method is proposed, in which the weight of each data point of sample function decreases with the increasing of lag distance between two points in a random field. Three types of soil parameters, including the CPT, the physical, and the hydraulic parameters, are tested by in-situ and laboratory tests, and the SOFs of these parameters are computed. Computation of the SOFs proves that the VRM combined with the suggested WLS is a good method for computing the SOFs of soil properties. Comparison of the SOFs shows that there are negligible differences among the three types of soil parameters of clay layers in Hefei, which is further proved by the Wilcoxon test from a statistical point of view. By using the VRM combine with WLS, the SOFs of clay are computed based on 509 sets of CPT data from 34 sites in Hefei. The statistics of SOFs can give a reference for the selection of SOF for reliability analysis or reliability-based design of geo-structures with spatial variability.\n               ","18":"\n                  It is essential and important for engineering design and maintenance to systematically investigate the physical\u2013mechanical properties of frozen soils.

The results indicate that brittle and plastic failures occur for frozen silty clay under low and high confining pressures, respectively, and strengthening and weakening effects from the water content and confining pressure on the frozen strength are also observed. With the increase in confining pressure or water content, the compressive strength first increases to a maximum and then begins to decrease, and at the same time, the pressure fracturing of pore ice is gradually aggravated. Under the combination of confining pressure and water content, the microstructure evolution of frozen silty clay includes the soil particles or cementing soil crushed and reclotted, the initial soil skeleton destroyed, the pore ice fractured and melted, and the growth of microcracks, which mainly depends on the amount of water content and axial and radial loads.

This study proposes a practical framework to develop a slope digital twin and describes its application to predict the temporal variation of rainfall-induced slope instability of a real slope in Hong Kong. When compared with a conventional slope model that remains unchanged, the proposed slope digital twin combines monitoring data (e.g., data on rainfall and pore water pressure in the slope) and slope survival records to probabilistically update the model. Specifically, the most suitable model settings are selected, and both the hydraulic and strength parameters of the soils are updated, thereby decreasing the associated uncertainties. The updated slope model can predict pore water pressure responses of a target rainfall consistent with the actual measurements. Furthermore, the model can be used to predict the temporal variation of slope stability (e.g., by using a factor of safety with quantified uncertainty or slope failure probability) during the target rainfall. Because the monitoring data and past slope survival records are incorporated in the model updating, the proposed slope digital twin enhances the prediction of soil hydraulic responses and slope stability. The predicted temporal variation of slope stability agrees well with the observed slope failure induced by an extreme rainstorm in June of 2008.\n               ","20":"\n                  The statistical analysis of the main physical, mechanical and ultrasonic features of various sedimentary rock samples (limestone, calcarenite, marly calcisiltite and sandstone) is presented with the aim of finding reliable models to predict the static elastic modulus from known properties. Based on the relevance of the static elastic modulus Estat in engineering geological applications and on the increasing need of non-destructive procedures for its estimation, this paper attempts to establish prediction models by means of single and multiple regression approaches and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). While in the first two cases rock properties are plotted against each other to study their mutual dependence, even combining more than one independent variable, the Artificial Neural Network approach allows a self-learning model capable of predicting a target value from known input variables to be built. Results show that the static elastic modulus of tested rocks is mainly related to the rock Uniaxial Compressive Strength and it varies with respect to the seismic wave velocities (both compressional Vp and longitudinal Vs) and, consequently, to the dynamic elastic modulus Edyn calculated by ultrasonic tests. In particular, there is a numerical difference between the static and dynamic values of the elastic modulus, as the dynamic ones are generally higher than the corresponding static values. Satisfactory prediction equations were found by multiple regressions involving Vp, Edyn and the rock bulk density, thus providing useful statistical laws for the indirect calculation of Estat. The results arising from the ANN models are used herein to draft Estat prediction graphs from known variables, in the perspective of a practical utility for the quick and non-destructive estimation of the static elastic property of tested sedimentary rocks.\n               ","21":"\n                  In the mountainous areas passed by the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway, rockfall is one of the important geological hazards with characteristics of unpredictable and sudden occurrences.

For the rockfall investigation of areas where unstable blocks are widely distributed, this study proposes a new methodology for 3D rockfall risk statistical analysis to conduct well-directed rockfall simulations and perform a rockfall analysis on a tunnel portal. This methodology first narrows down the rockfall source regions through a field investigation and by slope aspect. Then, the critical source areas that threaten the tunnel portal are determined by preliminary simulation results. Finally, unstable blocks within the critical source areas are interpreted, and well-directed simulations are performed. The rockfall risk analysis on the tunnel portal is conducted on the basis of trajectory distributions and kinematic parameters. This methodology greatly simplifies the rockfall simulation process and reduces the workload of unstable block identification and interpretation.

Focus on buildings at the torrential fan, this paper aims to develop a vulnerability model that can assess their maximum potential damage and support the planning and development of the torrential fan. The model was developed based on 51 building damage data collected at 11 torrential fans. The hazard intensity was defined by the geometric configuration of torrential fans and the location of assessed buildings. In addition, a physical experiment was carried out to study the shielding effect of building groups. The results show that the shielding effect range is about 25 times the building size, and the maximum reduction in impact force can reach 60%.

The Co-NMM is an extension of the numerical manifold method (NMM) and designed for efficiently addressing continuity-discontinuity problems of rock especially complex multiple-fracture propagation, while the UPM is a relatively novel approach for underground seepage analysis with single\u2212\/multiphase fluid flow in both fractured and fractured porous reservoirs. To link the Co-NMM and UPM properly, a two-phase seepage-stress coupling model is proposed for considering interactions between the fractured rock mass and two-phase fluids. The mechanical behaviour of the fractured rock mass responds to the variation in skeletal effective stress induced by the average two-phase fluid pressure in both the rock matrix and fractures, including deformation of the rock matrix, change in fracture aperture and the initiation and propagation of fractures. Accordingly, the induced changes in hydraulic behaviours such as the porosity, permeability and capillary pressure are captured by nonlinear stress-dependent coupling functions.

Therefore, the variations in physical properties of bentonite buffer material under high-temperature conditions are one of the important parameters in the DGRs for HLW.

Based on the crystal layer structure characteristics of montmorillonite, the quantitative relationships between the physical properties of bentonite and its mineral composition or bound water content were established to further explain the mechanism by which thermal ageing affects the physical properties of MX80 bentonite.

The uniaxial compressive strength, axial stiffness, and softening coefficient of the water-immersed coal samples were reduced compared to those of the control, and the softening degree increased with increasing degree of water immersion. Further, the stress threshold values for crack initiation and crack damage and their ratios to the peak stress decreased with increasing softening degree.

Along the runoff direction, we show that the relative topsoil clay content increases, but slope surface deformation and failure lead to a decrease in the relative content of clay in deposits located on the lower of slope. The original thickness of slope surface decreases in the upper part of the slope, due to particle migration, while the slope surface relatively far away from the upper part of the slope tends to be thicker, due to the accumulation of slope deposits. The actual evaporation of the topsoil relatively far from the upper part of the slope is significantly weaker (63%\u201372% probability), which may be related to the high clay content, dense soil structure, and high content of clay minerals. The topsoil evaporation also tends to weaken as overburden thickness increases.

Solid and fluid components in the mixture are coupled through the interaction forces, namely buoyancy, drag, and virtual mass. The model is calibrated against results from instrumented flume experiments and from field measurements of saturated, channelized debris flows. The numerical model captures the enhanced mobility of debris flows due to the presence of interstitial fluid and provides better predictions of the flow dynamics relative to those obtained from single-phase frameworks. Better modeling agreement is obtained for granular-fluid flows with relatively high fluid content. The model is then used to simulate real debris flow events, including a case that occurred in the proximity of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, where good agreement with reported field measurements is obtained. This modeling framework is expected to improve mitigation strategies for debris flows hazards.\n               ","33":"\n                  In this work, we present the results of a rockfall trajectory study performed on the south-western slope of Mt. Catiello (Sorrento Peninsula, southern Italy). Such a study develops within a multi-methodological approach which integrates different types of remote sensing data and techniques. Specifically, ground-truth data (e.g., rock mass geo-structural information, rock block inventory) were generated by geologically-supervised interpretations of high-resolution virtual outcrop models (VOMs). These data were then used for reconstructing the in-situ fractured rock mass attributes of the Mt. Catiello peak, as provided by a Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model, and to prepare the subsequent numerical simulations of rockfall trajectories. The resulting rockfall scenarios are consistent with the ground-truth data, both in terms of size and spatial distribution. Thus, we believe that the proposed approach can be effectively applied to other areas, characterized by similar geological features but higher levels of exposure and vulnerability.\n               ","34":"\n                  Compacted bentonite is considered as an engineered barrier in geological disposal of nuclear waste in fractured rocks. One concern with this concept is that the expansion of bentonite into fractures as the system saturates may lead to its erosion by flowing water. The loss of bentonite through erosion over long times may compromise the barrier. Commercial bentonite contains less soluble accessory minerals and experimental observations have shown that these are co-transported with clay minerals during expansion and form a mineral film at the eroding boundary. Quantifying the effects of the mineral film on the erosion rate is important for the assessment of the long-term sealing capacity of bentonite barriers. The paper presents a model for the extrusion of bentonite into fractures that considers key processes governing the co-transport of less soluble accessory minerals and explains why and where the mineral film forms and how it affects the erosion rate.\n                  The model is tested against two sets of published experimental data. It is demonstrated that the model predicts the phenomena observed in experiments: the build-up of a mineral film near the extrusion boundary; and the progressive growth of the mineral film thickness. Importantly, the model allows for investigating the effects of key environmental and material parameters \u2013 water chemistry, filtration coefficient, and mineral fraction \u2013 on the expansion and erosion. The results of such investigations are presented. It is shown that higher water ion concentration, larger filtration coefficient, and larger fraction of accessory minerals retard the swelling and extrusion of bentonite, thus reducing the overall erodibility. It is further shown that the presence of less soluble accessory minerals may reduce the loss of bentonite by a factor of 2 compared to a pure bentonite.\n               ","35":"\n                  A large-scale landslide in a deep valley often travels a long distance. The moving landslide debris impacts into the valley and interacts with the river and the opposite side of the valley. In the landslide movement process, energy, mass and momentum transfers inevitably take place. An in-depth study of energy and mass transfer mechanisms in various types of flow-like landslides will provide a scientific basis for developing energy criteria for evaluating landslide hazard chains and mitigation measures. In this study, a coupled DEM-ALE method is used to systematically evaluate the energy transfer mechanisms in landslides of various solid concentrations. The landslide dynamics involving river damming can be divided into three stages: the travel stage, the interaction stage, and the deposition stage. Kinetic energy is dominant in the travel stage but the frictional energy dissipation increases rapidly in the interaction stage. In the deposition stage, the kinetic energy changes to other energy components. The energy transfer mechanisms differ in different types of landslides. The kinetic energy of the fluid phase is mainly dissipated by viscosity shearing and turbulence, which is less efficient than internal and boundary frictional dissipations in the solid phase. The fraction of friction-dissipated energy increases with the solid concentration of the landslide mixture. Most of the remaining energy is dissipated by turbulence. Kinetic energy is the main energy transfer component during the landslide-river interaction. Flows of lower solid concentrations, e.g., debris flows, impact larger areas but are less likely to block a river.\n               ","36":"\n                  Chemical corrosion of rock masses commonly exists in natural environment (e.g., rock masses immersed in acidic groundwater) and in rock engineering practice (e.g., acid fluid injection in unconventional reservoirs). Rock fractures as the primary paths for fluid flow are susceptible to the chemical treatment, which may lead to geologic hazards (e.g., induced landslides and earthquakes). Here we show the transitional behaviors of rock fractures between stick-slip and stable sliding due to the chemical corrosion, which is characterized by a sequence of fast rupture followed by one or more slow ruptures. The chemical corrosion also modifies the frictional properties of rock fractures, in terms of friction rate parameters, characteristic weakening distance, stiffness ratio, and frictional property ratio. Our results indicate that the chemical corrosion essentially reduces the critical stiffness of the fracture and makes it approach the stiffness of the loading system, resulting in the occurrence of slip transition. The slip transition is strongly influenced by treatment duration and shear process, and the real area of contact density is a physical control linking fracture surface topography and frictional responses, such as AE energy and shear stress drop. The understanding of slip transition can improve our ability to interpret the seismic data and to predict the slip behaviors.\n               ","37":"\n                  To date, investigations of soils in Shanghai have mainly focused on upper clays, namely, Layer 2\u20136, generally within 30\u201340\u00a0m depth. Knowledge of the deep clays of Layer 8 and 10, at depths of approximately 50\u00a0m and 100\u00a0m, respectively, is very limited. In this study, the detailed geotechnical properties of the deep Shanghai clays of these two layers were investigated through a series of field and laboratory tests. Physical property tests showed that both clays can be classified as low-plasticity silty clay. For the first time in Shanghai, high-quality intact clay samples were retrieved from the deep soil using a double-tube rotary sampler. High-pressure oedometer tests and consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial tests were conducted to evaluate the compressibility and shear strength of intact samples. The oedometer tests indicate that Layer 8 is an overconsolidated clay with an overconsolidation ratio (OCR) of 2\u20133, and Layer 10 is a normally consolidated clay with a light degree of structure. CU triaxial tests further confirmed the above findings. The compressibility of the Layer 8 clay is lower, and its undrained shear strength and effective friction angle are larger than those of Layer 10, with the latter being deeper. The sensitivity framework, based on Burland's intrinsic compression line (ICL) and sedimentary compression line (SCL), can be used to characterize the overconsolidation\/structure nature of the deep Shanghai clays. The strain energy method was found to be more suitable than the Casagrande method for determining the preconsolidation pressure of the deep Shanghai clays.\n               ","38":"\n                  Instability of slopes, embankments, and cuttings on the railway network is increasingly prevalent globally. Monitoring vulnerable infrastructure aids in geotechnical asset management, and improvements to transport safety and efficiency. Here, we examine the use of a novel, near-real-time Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) monitoring system for assessing the stability of a railway cutting in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. In 2015, an ERT monitoring system was installed across a relict landslide (grassed) and an area of more stable ground on either side (wooded), to monitor changes in electrical resistivity through time and space, and to assess the influence of different types of vegetation on the stability of transportation infrastructure. Two years of 4-Dimensional ERT monitoring results are presented here, and petrophysical relationships developed in the laboratory are applied to calibrate the resistivity models in order to provide an insight into hydrogeological pathways within a railway cutting. The influence of vegetation type on subsurface moisture pathways and on slope stability is also assessed \u2013 here we find that seasonal subsurface changes in moisture content and soil suction are exacerbated by the presence of trees (wooded area). This results in shrink-swell behaviour of the clays comprising the railway cutting, resulting in fissuring and a reduction in shear strength, leading to instability. As such, it is proposed that on slopes comprised of expansive soils, grassed slopes are beneficial for stability. Insights into the use of 4-D ERT for monitoring railway infrastructure gained from this study may be applied to the monitoring of critical geotechnical assets elsewhere.\n               ","39":"\n                  This study investigated the respective correlation coefficients between pore water pressure (PWP) development in sandy soil and 41 CAV-based (cumulative absolute velocity) ground motion intensity measures and peak ground acceleration (PGA).

The construction of a new road often requires cuttings to be made, especially in hilly topography. In LIC\/LMICs, many practitioners rely on guidelines to design roadside cuttings, however, some of these guidelines lack accuracy as they are not developed using rigorous stability analysis methods. Stability charts offer a more reliable alternative to some guidelines; however, these are difficult to use in the field. To overcome this gap, we present a new methodology to develop rigorous and user-friendly guidelines for the preliminary design of roadside cuttings. The guidelines are developed using failure criteria commonly employed by practitioners (i.e. Generalised-Hoek-Brown for rock and Mohr-Coulomb for soil) and a rigorous Limit Equilibrium Method, Morgenstern-Price, for stability analyses. In addition, we consider upslope geometric boundary conditions and slope seepage. The guidelines are designed to be user-friendly by including categories with accessible descriptions to characterise the slope material and geometry that can be selected by a practitioner in the field. Then the methodology is showcased by producing new guidelines for the design of road cuttings in Nepal and Ethiopia. We believe the systematic use of guidelines developed following the novel methodology here illustrated will reduce design error, and thus lead to road cuttings of increased life span.\n               ","41":"\n                  Stratigraphic modeling with quantified uncertainty is an open question in engineering geology. In this study, a novel stratigraphic stochastic simulation approach is developed by integrating a Markov random field (MRF) model and a discriminant adaptive nearest neighbor-based k-harmonic mean distance (DANN-KHMD) classifier into a Bayesian framework. The DANN-KHMD classifier is effective for extracting anisotropic patterns from sparse and heterogeneous spatial categorical data such as borehole logs. The MRF parameters can be initially estimated roughly or customized (if site-specific knowledge is available). Later these parameters can be updated and regularized in an unsupervised manner with constraints from site exploration results in a Bayesian manner. Throughout the learning process, both the soil profile and the MRF parameters are updated in a probabilistic manner. The advantages of the proposed approach can be summarized into four points: 1) inferring stratigraphic profile and associated uncertainty in an automatic and fully unsupervised manner; 2) reasonable initial stratigraphic configurations can be sampled and hence lower the computational cost; 3) both stratigraphic uncertainty and model uncertainty are taken into consideration throughout the inferential process; 4) relying on no training stratigraphy images.

The results indicate that irreversible rearrangement of grain configurations was pronounced in RIBS with increased rubber at the conditioning phase leading to a reduction in particle deformation during the cyclic loading. It was also demonstrated that the increased rubber content in RIBS increases the energy absorption capacity and damping properties, reduces ballast breakage and resilient modulus. In addition, the study confirmed 10% by weight as the optimum rubber content in RIBS, considering the overall deformation and degradation performance of ballast.\n               ","43":"\n                  Ancient landslides of unknown origin can be found in large numbers in mountainous regions; some represent valid markers of (pre-)historic natural regimes referring to either long-term evolution or short-term peak events of climatic and seismotectonic nature. An example is represented by the Balta rockslide in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. Its location in the seismically active Vrancea-Buzau region, as well as its morphological features, deep-seated rupture surface and large debris volume, raise the question of its failure history with regard to a possible co-seismic triggering. A 3D volume based reconstruction of the slope morphology together with field measurements of elasto-plastic in-situ rock properties allow to estimate pre-failure conditions of the slope, with special regards to the geological, i.e. flysch bedrock of poor to fair rock quality, and structural settings, i.e. anti-dip slope bedding crossed by the main joint family. The reconstructed slope behaviour was tested under static and dynamic forces with the 3D distinct element code 3DEC, subsequently used to simulate a failure scenario with a 120\u00a0s long real earthquake record that leads to the realistic post-failure morphology of Balta. For the latter, we observe a principally joint-controlled failure combined with internal fracturing of the undamaged rock mass.

In order to investigate the effect of sample thickness, a series of hydration tests were carried out in this paper and the evolutionary process of bentonite was visualized using a custom-designed device. Corresponding digital images were acquired by time-lapse photography and analyzed by image processing techniques. Experimental results showed that the sample thickness exerted an apparent effect on both the self-sealing and the hydration cracking of compacted bentonite. Increasing thickness slowed down the self-sealing process and thus prolonged the time needed to seal the technological voids. Moreover, it was found that thickening the sample inhibited the development of hydration cracks and simplified the crack network notably, indicated by a decreasing trend of crack amount, length and area. In addition, the fractal dimension, characterizing the complexity degree of crack network, decreased with the increase of thickness. By fitting and predicting, a critical value was obtained that if the sample thickness exceeded it, no hydration cracks could be observed on the surface and no penetrating cracks could be formed in the sample. These conclusions are of great importance in the design of bentonite barriers by reducing the incidence of hydration cracks.\n               ","45":"\n                  The reduction of soil suction and consequent loss of shear strength due to infiltration is known to trigger shallow landslides during periods of concentrated rainfall. In the mountainous terrain of Nepal, the risk of shallow rainfall-induced landsliding is further exacerbated by non-engineered hillslope excavation for local roads construction. To better understand the combined effect of rainfall and road cutting on landsliding, a detailed investigation of a shallow landslide was conducted, on a site with a steep road cut that failed due to rainfall infiltration in July 2018. An integrated investigation approach was adopted, combining field and laboratory testing and field monitoring with a series of coupled hydro-mechanical analyses with the finite element code PLAXIS 2D. The field and laboratory tests were performed to characterise the subsoil condition and determine the soil parameters for the hydro-mechanical analyses. The field monitoring program was set up to obtain real-time measurements of rainfall and volumetric water content of the soil. The monitored data was used to calibrate the numerical model and assess the reliability of its predictions. Results of the numerical back-analysis suggest that the investigated landslide was triggered by rainfall infiltration causing a gradual reduction of soil suction at shallow depths of \u22641.7\u00a0m and the presence of the steep road cut promoted slope failure by allowing larger displacements to occur in the hillslope. Without the road cut, the slope was found to have ~35% greater initial factor of safety and under the landslide-triggering rainfall, the undisturbed slope was found to remain stable with ~170% greater factor of safety than that in the slope with the road cut. This indicates that the presence of a road cut increases the likelihood of landslide during rainfall and lowers the minimum level of rainfall needed for landslide initiation. Hence, rainfall-induced roadside slope failures could become more frequent and extensive if roads continue to be built by informal slope excavation, without adopting suitable interventions, some examples of which are presented in this study.\n               ","46":"\n                  This paper presents an experimental investigation on eleven loess soils retrieved from NW China to explore the influence of grading and age on soil mechanics.

This research aimed to characterize the seismic behavior near an intrusive dyke that intersected with the roadways in an underground longwall coal mine in Australia. The temporal-spatial variations of seismic multi-parameters around the stiff dyke were analyzed, including clustered seismicity, event locations, Es\/Ep ratio, b-value and correlation with the released seismic energy. Four stages were defined based on the evolutions of seismic characteristics. The rock fractures initiated near the dyke when the longwall face was 400\u00a0m from the dyke. The seismicity started to increase when the longwall was <100\u00a0m from the dyke and decreased drastically after the longwall mined 50\u00a0m past the dyke. The seismic events were concentrated at the inbye side of the dyke and propagated to the outbye side of the dyke as the longwall mined through the dyke. The spatial distribution of Es\/Ep ratios and temporal variations of the b-value indicated that higher magnitude seismic events dominated by shear failures occurred in the hanging wall of the dyke, suggesting more sudden seismic energy release and escalating seismic risks around the roadways at the inbye side of the dyke. Meanwhile, when the longwall was mining through the dyke, even though the seismicity was intensive, seismic energy was more frequently and gently released so that stress was not significantly accumulated to induce any major failures at the outbye side of the dyke. The results demonstrated that the geological features of the dyke and the longwall mining progress had a controlling effect on the seismic characteristics in the time-space domain.

Fortunately, numerical methods can provide adequate descriptions of these behaviors. Discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) is a powerful method that can be used to simulate the behavior of solid blocks, including rocks and structures. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can effectively simulate the behavior of fluid flows and soil materials. To take advantage of both methods, the coupling of DDA and SPH is investigated in this study, where the coupled DDA-SPH method is used to study the mechanical behaviors of SRM slopes. Two verification tests are investigated to demonstrate the accurate calculation of the interaction force and impact force using the coupled method. A series of simulations are then performed considering different shapes, sizes and contents of rocks and their distributions in SRM slopes. Results show that the deformation of the SRM slope is proportional to the roundness but inversely proportional to the sorting coefficient of the rock blocks. Additionally, the deformation of the SRM slope with rocks distributed along the potential sliding surface is much smaller than that with rocks distributed in the sliding body. In addition, the runout distance of an SRM landslide and the maximum impact force on nearby buildings increase with higher rock contents, which is more destructive to nearby structures and human lives.\n               ","53":"\n                  Coral reef limestone (CRL) is a type of biomass limestone formed by reef-building corals and other biological skeletons. Owing to its complex diagenesis environment, CRL consists of a different composition and structural characteristics compared to other homogeneous rocks. In this study, a series of triaxial compression experiments with real-time computerized tomography (CT) scanning revealed the evolution of fracture damage in CRL. The evolution of crack shape characteristics through three-dimensional reconstruction was visually displayed. Moreover, a calculation method for Poisson's ratio was derived using the CT value. Results indicate that the ratio of crack initiation stress to peak stress in CRL ranges from 60% to 75%, and the residual strength after destruction is high. According to the evolution curve of CT value, the triaxial test process was divided into the compression stage I, damage stage II, and destruction stage III. Under the external load, the compaction and damage law of specimens could be characterized using the characteristic parameters of pores as well as the damage variable D. In the CT value-based rock damage constitutive model, the initial damage factor of CRL ranges from 2.95 to 14.78, which is significantly higher than that of homogeneous rocks.\n               ","54":"\n                  In this study, swelling pressures of MX80 bentonite were determined by different common methods, and the microstructures were investigated by performing mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests. The obtained results and in-depth analysis allowed the microstructure-based conceptual model to be proposed for the determination of expansive soil swelling pressure. This conceptual model implied that the comparable swelling pressures determined by the swell-under-load (SUL) method, the constant-volume (CV) method, the zero-swell (ZS) method, the pre-swell (PS) method and the Cui's method were attributed to the similar macro (or micro) void ratios (e\n                     M or e\n                     m) generated during hydro-mechanical loadings.

Reservoir operation, especially during rapid drawdown, affects the long-term stability of reservoir bank slopes as this process affects the stress, seepage and deformation characteristics of the water-level fluctuation (WLF) zone. Thus, the characteristics of the deformation and failure mode of WLF zones reinforced by umbrella-shaped anchors under rapid drawdown conditions are important for the design and construction of anchoring measures. Five slope-anchor scale models based on the Yingpan landslide were established as transparent soil models considering different slope angles and drawdown rates. Displacement, velocity and macroscopic deformation data were obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The results indicated that the deformation process of both reinforced and unreinforced slopes under rapid drawdown conditions could be divided into four phases: initial, shallow sliding, multisliding and stable phases. In the anchor-reinforced models, loss of soil particles occurred when the water level dropped to reach the anchor heads, causing the anchor plates to loosen and slope deformation to accelerate, especially near the lower row of cables. The anchor heads failed first, and progressive slope sliding ensued. Under rapid drawdown conditions, soil liquefaction and subsequent loosening and sliding occurred, generating a far larger zone of accumulation than the zone of collapse. This indicates that soil liquefaction is another important factor of the link between rapid water level drawdown and slope instability causing local collapses. Combining the experimental results and 47 sets of field monitoring data, it could be concluded that the slope stability decreases with increasing slope angle of the WLF zone. This occurs because a higher water level is needed for deformation initiation in the WLF zone in the case of a higher slope angle.\n               ","56":"\n                  For the deformation and evaluation of reservoir accumulative landslide, it is of great significance to study the strength characteristics of slip zone soils under rainfall and reservoir operation.

Then, the shear strength of slip zone soils under different seepage-shear conditions is studied to reveal the strength evolution law of riverside landslide. Eventually, the creep characteristics of slip zone soils are described by the Burger model. The experimental results indicate that: (1) the weakening effect of slip zone soils will be induced by the increase of seepage cycles, change amount of seepage pressure, initial and constant seepage pressure, which decrease the residual strength of slip zone soils. (2) When the seepage cycles are <15, the weakening of residual strength of slip zone soils is not obvious. While when the cycles reach 20, the residual strength of soil samples decreases rapidly. (3) The Burger model, which connected the Maxwell model and Kelvin model in series can appropriately reflect the creep characteristics of slip zone soils of Tongjiaping landslide.

Results showed that the wetting-drying cycles caused an increase of void ratio and changed the bi-modal porosity to tri-modal characteristics for the untreated samples, while it led to a reversible variation of void ratio and an unchanged bi-modal pore size distribution characteristics for lime-treated samples, indicating the soil improvement by lime treatment. Thereby, the wetting-drying cycles made the compression curve of untreated samples change from convex to linear shape, while their effect was visible but not significant for the lime-treated soil. Higher decrease of macro-pore void ratio with loading was obtained on the lime-treated samples under wetting-drying cycles compared to the as-compacted samples, indicating a slight softening of soil structure by the wetting-drying cycles. Regarding the effect of wetting fluid nature, synthetic seawater resulted in a higher compressibility than deionised water. This was attributed to the presence of higher quantity of macro-pores in the samples wetted by synthetic seawater induced by the shrinkage of clay fraction. The aggregate size had slight effect on the compressibility of as-compacted samples due to their similar production of cementitious compounds and matric suction. Nevertheless, after wetting-drying cycles, the lime-treated samples S5 had lower decrease of macro-pore void ratio than the lime-treated samples S0.4, due to the significant reduction of macro-pore population with wetting-drying cycles.\n               ","58":"\n                  Dewatering is mandatory for deep excavations above confined aquifers.

This study conducted a coupled hydro-mechanical numerical analysis on a case history of a deep excavation with dewatering and recharge construction measures. The numerical model and input parameters were validated by field data. Results of drawdown distributions, pore pressure variations, vertical effective stress and stratum deformations were analyzed in association with construction activities. It is found that the drawdown of the confined aquifer was closely correlated to dewatering and recharge activities. The excavation-induced settlement mainly occurred in soft soil layers, whereas the stratum deformation induced by dewatering and recharge occurred in the aquifer and adjacent aquitards. The distinct stratum responses could be attributed to different changes in pore pressure and effective stress induced by excavation, dewatering and recharge.\n               ","59":"\n                  High stress induced by excavation disturbance in deep hard rock engineering can cause rockburst accidents.

The fundamental principles and detail steps of the proposed framework are explained for the SBU quantification and simulation and the subsequent SBU-based slope stability analysis. The framework is illustrated and validated by real data from a real estate project site and a slope site from literature. Then, the effect of borehole number on SBU and slope stability analysis are examined using the framework.

There are many factors that influenced its formation mechanism, including the activity of the Shunyi-Liangxiang (SL) fault, land subsidence and human engineering activities. Fine-scale surface deformation at BCIA was obtained by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), using 27 TerraSAR-X data with a 3\u00a0m resolution, to better understand the failure phenomenon and formation mechanism of the ground fissure. Spatially, the SL fault intersects runway 36R obliquely at the airport, and the fissure forms along the fault. A zone of subsidence was observed on the footwall (northwest side) of the SL fault; however, the ground fissure along the SL fault dips towards the southeast. The InSAR subsidence rate profiles show a rate difference of 9\u201317\u00a0mm\/yr across the ground fissure, consistent with the deformation characteristics of concrete surface fractures at BCIA. Constrained by the subsidence rate obtained by InSAR, the discrete element method (DEM) was applied to simulate the failure process of runway 36R. The formation mechanism of the ground fissure was revealed: the SE-dipping SL normal fault is the most important geological factor controlling the boundary of subsidence and extension of the ground fissure; the regional subsidence on the footwall of the SL fault is the main triggering factor in the development of the ground fissure; the damage of the concrete surface induced localized uplift; and the decrease in soil strength in the fault zone has led to localized subsidence along the ground fissure.\n               ","62":"\n                  Understanding the mechanisms of injection-induced seismicity is critical for managing the anthropogenic geohazard, which recently hinders the development of geothermal energy.

We aimed to provide laboratory evidence for slip transition of the chemically treated fractures in geothermal reservoirs. We found that the amount of induced seismic events is promoted by the acid treatment, and the distribution of these seismic events is expanded in the post-acid water injection. Our experimental study demonstrated non-linear distributions of water pressure and frictional strength over the fracture during the water injection. The ratio of the shear stress variation to the fluid pressure variation reduces with a larger aseismic slip front amplification factor, which reflects the transition from the aseismic to seismic slip. The study revealed that the acid treatment potentially causes an increase in seismic event amount but a reduction in moment magnitude in the chemically treated region. The aseismic slip in the treated region may promote shear stress gradient along the fracture and result in the seismic events expanding in untreated regions. Additionally, the moment magnitude may be amplified when the fracture dictates neighboring fractures beyond the treated region.\n               ","63":"","64":"\n                  Debris flow is one of the most unpredictable geohazards in terms of occurrence and magnitude due to its random nature on flow initiation and changing mass during the flow process.

A rational approach requires detail analysis of flow kinematics in calculating the amount of erosion. However, based on study of several case histories, certain erosional characteristics are found which can be used to calculate changes in the flow mass during the flow process. In this study, a progressive entrainment runout model is used to investigate the erosion characteristics of debris flow and rock avalanche. Four historical cases of debris flow and rock avalanche with long runout distance, steep channel slope, and high travel velocity are being studied. These four cases have some common features but they have different triggering mechanisms, elevation variations and particle size distributions. The results of the analysis show that >50% of erosion occurs in the second half of the flow path. The rate of erosion at the front of the debris is not only dependent on the slope of the flow channel, it also depends on other factors such as the depth of the debris, the velocity of flow and the physical properties of the debris material and the physical characteristics of the flow channel. Most importantly, based on these case studies, it is found that the rate of erosion along the flow channel can be determined based on the velocity, height of the debris and other flow characteristics.

To meet this demand, a novel framework to calibrate allowable safety factors based on reliability theory is proposed in this study. First, a sample set of CSG dams with the same safety factor are collected. Second, the reliability indices of all dams are calculated, and the reliability index distribution is analyzed, which can reveal the relationship between the reliability index and the safety factor. Third, a 90% guaranteed rate is adopted to link the allowable safety factor with the target reliability index. Updated safety factors could be derived with consideration of the uncertainty of input parameters. Such safety factors are suitable for CSG dams with materials of large heterogeneity and dispersion. The allowable safety factors of CSG dams with structure grades I, II, and III are suggested to be 2.9, 2.6, and 2.2, respectively. Dam height and cohesion significantly have a significant impact on the allowable safety factors, with sensitivity coefficients ranging from 0.29 to 0.84 and from 0.05 to 0.25, respectively. A higher allowable safety factor corresponds to a dam with a higher dam height and lower cohesion.

During the operational phase of the repository, an increase in underground water pH, from 7.5 to a value as high as 13.5 is expected, due to the release of alkaline plumes from concrete degradation, resulting in possible changes in the mineralogy of the host rock. While clay mineral dissolution is known to occur and affect the hydro-mechanical properties of the host rock, the dissolution of other minerals present in claystone, i.e., quartz and calcite, can also take place. This study focuses on identification of such dissolutions by considering NaOH, Ca(OH)2 and KOH alkaline solutions at different pHs (8.5, 11.5 and 13.5). A low pH\u00a0=\u00a08.5 was investigated to consider the gradual increase in pH of the underground water resulting from the progressive infiltration of alkaline plumes. Series of Opalinus Clay samples from the lower sandy facies of Mont Terri site were immersed in these solutions for six months and for one year. It was found that quartz dissolution occurred significantly at pHs higher than 11.5, but also at pHs as low as 8.5. The longer the exposure time, the more significant the quartz dissolution. Calcite dissolution was observed after six months at pH higher than 11.5, and after one year at pH higher than 8.5. Thus, the quartz dissolution seemed to be governed by the exposure time, while the calcite dissolution seemed to depend on both exposure time and pH value, due to carbonation phenomenon. While generally attention has been paid to the effect of alkalinity on clay minerals, this paper meticulously studies the dissolution of quartz and calcite initially present in significant proportions in the Opalinus Clay from the lower sandy facies of Mont Terri site by investigating a wide range of pHs. The dissolution of such minerals will undoubtedly affect the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the claystone. Thereby, it is of paramount importance to study this phenomenon in order to ensure the long-term safety of the nuclear waste disposal.

This equation is tested and verified against physical experiments and numerical simulations of waves overtopping rigid, impermeable triangular structures which serve as idealized natural dams. The proposed equation is found to adequately account for the first-order dependencies of the overtopping volume on the different dam and wave properties.

Our method uses measurements of surface shear wave velocities (Vs30) and predominant frequencies (f0) combined with gravity anomaly maps to update the geographic extension of seismic amplification classes. Additionally, we trained the predictive models to interpolate and extrapolate Vs30 and f0 to the unsampled sites. Applying this method to the Santiago basin resulted in (i) a refined seismic amplification map, and (ii) maps of Vs30 and f0 estimated with improved accuracy. The best predictions, obtained by ML techniques and validated through cross-validation, are possibly due to the inclusion of spatial covariates for algorithm training, enhancing the ability of the model to capture the spatial correlations of geological, geophysical and geotechnical data. The estimation of predominant frequencies (f0) is improved considerably by including gravity as a covariant. The accuracy of the f0 predictions apparently depends more on the choice of covariates than on the algorithm used, while the Vs30 predictions are more sensitive to the chosen algorithm. These results illustrate the great potential of machine learning predictive algorithms in digital soil mapping, which surpass traditional geostatistical techniques.

The other type is the high slope dynamic response, which shows that PGA\n                     \n                        h\n                      changes periodically and takes on a certain pattern along the slope surface with the increase in the slope elevation, and decreases gradually with the increase in the distance from the slope surface to the inside in the horizontal direction. Meanwhile, the critical height of the slope for different distribution patterns of PGA\n                     \n                        h\n                      varies with the slope material and the harder the rock material, the higher the critical slope height for the distribution patterns of PGA\n                     \n                        h\n                     .

The amplification coefficient at the crest increases with an increase in the dimensionless slope height (H\/\u03bb) and reaches the first peak value when H\/\u03bb reaches 0.17\u20130.20. The de-amplification at the crest occurred when H\/\u03bb was >0.4. The novel findings can support the input ground motion parameters for earthquake slope engineering design.\n               ","76":"\n                  Sand boils are a recognized phenomenon associated with soil liquefaction. However, the exact conditions required to produce sand boils remain unclear, and sand boil-induced settlement is difficult to quantify. The mechanism of sand boils and associated settlements due to soil liquefaction is investigated in this study using model testing. Loose saturated sand deposit is made in a transparent acrylic cylinder applied with torsional shaking to reproduce liquefaction and sand boils. An acrylic circular plate, whose diameter is slightly smaller than the cylinder's inner diameter, is placed on the model ground surface to mimic a non-liquefiable layer. The gap allows the liquefied sand to be ejected, leading to sand boils. The mechanism of sand boils and induced settlements is investigated by the transient variations of the measured water pressure at the sidewall, the recorded plate settlement, and the monitored video image. The influence of different thicknesses of the non-liquefiable layer, the gap sizes, and the overburden pressures on the sand boil-induced settlement is assessed quantitatively. It is found that the thicker the non-liquefied layer or the smaller ejecta gap size, the lower the amount of ejecta and associated subsidence is observed. The overburden pressure had relatively minor effect on the amount of ejecta, but it affected the amount of consolidation settlement significantly. Based on the observation of test results, a theoretical ejection head is proposed to determine the condition leading to sand boils.\n               ","77":"\n                  The Sichuan-Tibet Railway in eastern Tibet runs across numerous seismogenic faults with high seismic risks. The Lancangjiang fault (LCJF), one of the essential strike-slip faults within the Qiangtang block, traverses the railway. However, the geometry and late Quaternary activities of the LCJF remain unclear, limiting the assessment of seismic hazards on the Sichuan-Tibet Railway and the understanding of kinematic patterns in eastern Tibet. Based on the interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, field observations, and shallow geophysical exploration, we first mapped the detailed geometry of the northern LCJF. It consists of two branches: Yangda-Yaxu fault (YYF) and Baqing-Leiwuqi fault (BLF), which merge eastwards onto the main LCJF. Displaced landforms and multiple numerical dating techniques reveal that the YYF is a mainly sinistral fault with a late Quaternary slip rate of ~2.2\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.5\u00a0mm\/yr and a minor vertical component (~0.1\u00a0mm\/yr). The BLF undergoes an oblique motion with a left-lateral slip rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.5\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr and a northeast-vergent reverse rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.2\u00a0mm\/yr in the Holocene. Vector analysis of slip rates suggests that the LCJF has a sinistral rate of ~3.5\u00a0+\u00a01.1\/\u22120.8\u00a0mm\/yr with a reverse component of ~1.6\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr, displaying an essential role in strain partitioning of eastern Tibet. Together with slip rates of other intra-block faults, the kinematic pattern of eastern Tibet probably applies to the sub-block model. Offset geologic units yield a total displacement of ~10\u201311\u00a0km for the YYF. Using the slip rate of the YYF, the LCJF was initiated at ~5.9\u20133.9\u00a0Ma, probably related to the establishment of the present-day strain pattern and the onset of crustal thickening in eastern Tibet during the late Miocene. In addition, the active YYF and BLF across the Sichuan-Tibet Railway have a seismic potential of Mw ~7.2\u20137.3 that will produce a\u00a0~\u00a01.8\u20132.0\u00a0m sinistral slip on the YYF, and a\u00a0~\u00a02.0\u00a0m horizontal, and\u00a0~\u00a01.1\u20131.3\u00a0m reverse motion on the BLF. They will pose a high seismic hazard potential on the railway.

Anomalous seepage is a threat to the stability of dam structures and is a common hydrogeological hazard in engineering. It is of great significance to clarify seepage paths for targeted remediation. In this paper, we present the joint use of self-potential (SP) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) methods to characterize the seepage paths in an earth-filled dam, where there is already evidence of abnormal seepage. The ERT provides effective information on the resistivity structure of the dam. The SP data aims to invert electrokinetic current sources generated by the seepage. The results reveal that the seepage of the dam generates streaming potentials, which result in a negative SP anomaly with an amplitude of 50\u201380\u00a0mV at the surface. Based on electrokinetic current sources from SP data and resistivity structures, we reconstruct three seepage paths, which coincide well with field borehole information.

In this paper, using a concentric composite cylinder as the equivalent representative volume element (RVE), the analytical solutions of stress transfer model are derived from the modified shear-lag analysis.

The proposed DFN-based partitioning strategies rely on the distribution of the fractures among parallel processes.

As a case study, the reconstruction of a geology-based 3D velocity model of the uppermost hundreds of metres of the Amatrice high-seismic-hazard area is described.\n                  The model was constructed using geological (e.g., maps, cross-sections and core-wells) and geophysical (e.g., down-hole, MASW, refraction, and seismic noise measurements) data, which were georeferenced and uploaded into 3D geological modelling software, where faults, stratigraphic boundaries, and geophysical attributes were digitised, checked, hierarchised, and modelled. The performed 3D geological model was parameterised with Vs and Vp velocities and, finally, the environmental noise (i.e., horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio analysis, HVSR) recorded at some seismic stations was compared with the seismic responses modelled at some nearby control points.\n                  In the study area, the proposed geology-based 3D velocity model represents both a new potential geophysical prediction tool for areas devoid of geophysical measurements (i.e. HVSR curves) and a potential input-model for future ground-motion and seismic-wave-propagation simulations aimed at a more precise local seismic response assessment and, consequently, at the development of more realistic seismic hazard scenarios.\n                  The model here presented constitutes a first version of the 3D geological-geophysical model for the studied area, which will be improved with new data and more advanced algorithms available in the future.\n               ","83":"\n                  Constructing multiple-barrier systems is efficient in mitigating flow-like geological hazards and potentially serves as an optimal solution to protect the heavily threatened infrastructures, such as the ongoing Sichuan\u2013Tibet railway in China. However, the design of the multiple-barrier system remains essentially empirical, which hinders the development of scientific design guidelines for a robust and cost-effective barrier system. In this study, a new framework combined discrete element modelling (DEM) and deep neural network (DNN) was proposed to assist the design of a dual-barrier system. The DEM results are used as a database to construct a DNN model, where barrier spacing (L), barrier height (H) and Froude number (Fr) are input parameters to predict the energy-trapping efficiency of barriers on resisting granular flows. The energy-trapping efficiency serves as a key index to evaluate the design of a dual-barrier system. The DEM results show that when barrier spacing L\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0\u00a0h or barrier height H\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.0\u00a0h (where h denotes the flow depth), barrier spacing has a negligible effect on the energy-trapping efficiency. Those criteria can potentially be used to optimise the configuration of dual-barrier systems. Furthermore, the energy-trapping efficiency obtained by DEM model is reliably predicted by the DNN model, with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.9997, root mean square error equal to 0.0141, mean absolute percentage error equal to 0.0125, and variance account for equal to 99.68%, which demonstrates that the DNN model has a potential to optimize the configuration of dual-barrier systems in granular flow mitigation.\n               ","84":"\n                  Sinkhole is one of major geohazards in karst area where soluble carbonate bedrock is underlain by cover soils (e.g., sandy or clayey soils) and active groundwater circulation is present. Groundwater recharge easily erode the overburden soils away into cavities in the bedrock, and ultimately structural collapse in ground. The induced ground collapse\/subsidence may pose a great threat to human safety, environment, and buildings and infrastructure. The goal of this study is to develop a method\/tool to spatially assess the possibility of sinkhole occurrence. The paper presents two main taks: (1) development of a probabilistic spatial prediction model of sinkhole susceptibility and (2) a geographical information system (GIS)-based regional-scale sinkhole susceptibility map. The study area is the east central Florida (ECF) region that has been experiencing more abrupt and larger cover collapse sinkholes. The research methodology employs two statistical methods for the spatial prediction model, frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR), accounting for six criteria that are soil erosion, mechanical stability, distance, geology, human activity, and climate condition. The final section of factors includes head difference, soil permeability, thicknesses of aquifer systems (overburden, surficial\/intermediate aquifer), distance to karst features, surficial geology, lithology, land use\/land cover, and rainfall. Once the models were constructed, both models were validated and compared by using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The results indicate that the LR model better delineates high susceptibility areas of sinkhole and hydrological factors (recharge and head difference) are more accurately reflected on the model of the LR.\n               ","85":"\n                  The quantitative determination of the geological strength index (GSI) and disturbance factor (D) in the Hoek\u2013Brown failure criterion is of great value because it can increase the reliability of the rock engineering design. In this work, a quantitative method for estimating GSI and D values is developed by considering the acoustic wave velocity in the rock mass, C\n                     \n                        p\n                     .

The analysis results show that the new method to estimate GSI and D can accurately reflect the factors affecting the rock-mass quality and degree of disturbance before and after blasting or excavation. The new method has high reliability and is also applicable to rock masses that are quite broken (i.e. have low C\n                     \n                        p\n                      values).

The veracity of the improved Hoek\u2013Brown failure criterion was thus verified in a practical engineering context. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to rapidly determine the mechanical parameters of the rock mass when there is an insufficient amount of test data available.\n               ","86":"\n                  Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a recent technology that acquires acoustic vibrations via fiber optics sensors.

Quality control is required when the binder hardens, and acoustic surveys are an option for non-invasive and non-destructive testing. Relevant parameters to validate the effectiveness of the stabilization procedure are the mechanical properties of the materials.

The discussed test focuses on the spectral content of the acquired signal and on the estimation of the shear-wave distribution, and compares the DAS responses against signals measured during more traditional seismic surveys using standard geophones.\n                  Despite the inevitable differences between the datasets collected with the different techniques, all the reconstructed shear-wave velocity profiles effectively identify the stabilized soil layer.

Results show that the plastic creep limit of unsaturated road base aggregate is affected by the two-side effects of fines: reduction of friction angle and enhancement of matric suction. For the coarse-grain controlled soil (FC range from 0% to 4%) and fine-grain controlled soil (FC range from 8% to 16%), the plastic creep limit decreases with increasing FC due to the friction angle reduction caused by the inclusion of fines. For the transition soil (FC range from 4% to 8%) under unsaturated state, the plastic creep limit increases with the increase of FC as the dominant effect of fines shift to the enhancement of matric suction. By adopting an allowable cyclic stress ratio (CSR), a novel method is proposed, allowing prediction of the plastic creep limit based on the results from standard monotonic triaxial test for coarse-grain controlled soil and fine-grain controlled soil, and the results from post-cycle monotonic triaxial test for the transition soil.

The earthquake engineering community generally recognizes that the prediction of near-field strong ground motion can reduce the disasters caused by future large earthquakes and can guide earthquake prevention, disaster reduction and seismic design along the Sichuan\u2013Tibet railway. The M6.9 Mainling earthquake affected the stability of Sedongpu Glacier near the epicentre.

This study establishes a dynamic model for the landslide runout assessment along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. The proposed model is based on the shallow water theory and takes into account the mechanism that the friction is weakening with the increase of velocity, the finite difference method is used to solve the governing equations, and the ideal one-dimensional dam break experiment was used to verify the shock-capturing capacity of the numerical methods. The Lagang ancient landslide, only 500\u00a0m away from the Jiacha Station of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, represents the typical environment and development pattern of landslides in this region. Therefore, the proposed model is applied to discuss its effects on the landslide dynamic process and deposit patterns.

In this study, a series of cyclic uniaxial compression tests are conducted on sandstone subjected to 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 artificial F-T\u00a0cycles to investigate the influence of F-T treatment on the fatigue mechanical properties of sandstone, regarding the fatigue deformation characteristics, energy evolution and coupled F-T-fatigue damage. Our testing results indicate that sandstone specimens exposed to higher F-T\u00a0cycles are featured by larger irreversible strain and faster damage accumulation, leading to higher fatigue damage variable and lower fatigue life. By virtue of the digital image correlation (DIC) technique and scanning electron microscope (SEM), the progressive fatigue fracture process and the microscopic morphologies of fracture surfaces of the F-T treated sandstone specimens are revealed. During the cyclic loading process, the strain field in specimens uniformly distributes initially, and then it localizes continually with increasing cyclic number, triggering the eventual fatigue fracture. With increasing F-T\u00a0cycles, the fatigue fracture of sandstone is more ductile and progressive. Moreover, the hidden linkage between microscopic fracture mechanism and macroscopic mechanical properties is further analyzed based on the test results. In addition, the microscopic fracture mechanism of F-T treated sandstone under cyclic loading and monotonic loading is also compared and discussed: the primary micro-mechanism causing the fatigue fracture of sandstone is the inter-granular (IG) fracture, while the micro-mechanism triggering the monotonic failure is the trans-granular (TG) fracture.\n               ","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"","119":""},"Text":{"0":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nA rockfall is defined as discrete rock fragment(s) detached from the face of a slope which moves downslope by falling, bouncing, and rolling (Hungr et al., 2014). Rockfall hazard constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of transportation corridors along rocky cliffs (Hungr et al., 1999). Rockfall occurrence has been widely suggested to follow a power-low frequency-magnitude distribution (Malamud, 2004; Corominas et al., 2005). The risk management of this natural hazard has then been traditionally built upon projections of power-law models determined by statistical analysis of historical events. As such, the availability of rockfall databases has been of crucial importance in quantifying rockfall activity and characterizing the hazard.\n\n1.1\nLiDAR and rockfalls\nIn recent years, LiDAR technology has enabled engineering geologists to obtain millimeter-level spatial information of rock slopes in the form of a point cloud dataset (an assembly of points sampled in 3D space) in only a few minutes (Abell\u00e1n et al., 2014; Jaboyedoff et al., 2012). However, high-resolution point clouds can also be acquired by Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry with its respective strengths and limitations (Westoby et al., 2012). The dissemination of point clouds as a data type has played a decisive role in the development of advanced rockfall monitoring methodologies including development of automated data processing tools (Kromer et al., 2015, 2018, 2019). Furthermore, the highly accurate and detailed spatial information captured in LiDAR data, coupled with surface reconstruction algorithms (Berger et al., 2014), allow the enrichment of digital rockfall databases with additional rockfall features such as shape (Bonneau et al., 2019a, 2019b) and volume (DiFrancesco et al., 2020, 2021) in an automated manner.\nThis wealth of high-quality digital data permits new developments in rockfall assessment and prediction. Automated scanning campaigns provide the ability to successively capture the rock slope evolution in near-real-time (e.g., Williams et al., 2019). The rich spatio-temporal dataset generated (Fig. 1\n) supports enhanced future evolution of rockfall prediction models in three-dimensional (3D) space. Thus, apart from the standalone statistical analysis on the detected rockfalls' feature space (frequency-magnitude analysis), it generates the opportunity to orient the research towards the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) able to analyze change detection sequencies and map spatio-temporal rockfall patterns (Fig. 1) based on modern deep learning (DL) methods (Emmert-Streib et al., 2020). However, prerequisite to such an advancement is the need to efficiently automate the process of extracting rockfalls from raw change detection data to efficiently generate the required data for both the development and operation of such an AI. Rockfall extraction, which has been exclusively conducted either manually or semi-automatically (Schovanec et al., 2021) throughout the aforementioned rockfall monitoring evolution, typically requires intensive human effort (and interpretation), and is prone to multiple sources of human error like subjectivity, expertise, and experience that may differ from person to person involved in a particular project.\n\nDiFrancesco et al. (2020) discuss a state-of-the-art rockfall inventorization workflow including automated processes from data acquisition to rock slope deformation clustering using LiDAR data as illustrated in Fig. 2\n. The change detection is performed between time-sequential 3D point clouds and the negative (loss) changes are identified as failures (in blue in Fig. 2a). Subsequently, the process is applied also inversely to form both the front and back surface of the detached volumes which are then spatially clustered. Each detected change cluster (Fig. 2d) represents a single point cloud dataset consisting of the back and front surface points of the deformed volume. Therefore, automated rockfall detection can be treated as a point cloud classification problem.\n\n\n1.2\nRockfall detection as a point cloud classification problem\nSimilar to the well-known image classification problem, point cloud classification refers to the task of assigning a class label to a particular point cloud dataset. In contrast, point cloud semantic segmentation defines per-point class assignment within a given point cloud dataset. Classification of image data which are organized in rigid grids has been essentially a solved problem since the release of convolutional neural network (CNN) models in the field of DL (Krizhevsky et al., 2017).\nHowever, there are substantial difficulties in using a typical CNN architecture directly on point cloud data. The three main constrains are:\n\n\u2022\nPoint clouds are inherently unordered datasets and the network must be invariant to point permutations;\n\n\n\u2022\nThe network must be invariant to rigid transformations of the input shape; and,\n\n\n\u2022\nPoint clouds are inherently unstructured and interactions among points are not captured.\n\n\n\nMost existing point cloud classification (and semantic segmentation) models use handcrafted features for certain tasks. These features often encode specific statistical properties of points (Rusu et al., 2009; Weinmann et al., 2017) and are divided into local and global features. This practice of point cloud featuring also requires optimization of the feature space to fit the purposes of each machine learning (ML) task, which is a non-trivial process and usually relies on the selected ML classifier. One of the most popular ML models of the old generation of learning algorithms (pre-DL era) is the random forests (RF) (Breiman, 2001). To our best knowledge, only two studies have tackled point cloud classification for rockfall extraction among detected changes including also clutter\/limit effect, noise, and vegetation clusters. Both use handcrafted features and simple ML classifiers. Schovanec et al. (2021) compare a linear regression (LR) to a RF model over a two-year rock slope deformation database and Zoumpekas et al. (2021) compare several classifiers by incorporating data augmentation techniques over an imbalanced database (0.6% rockfall and 99.4% non-rockfall clusters). Other applications include the per-point classification of a rock slope point cloud (semantic segmentations) to map potential source zones for rockfall monitoring purposes (Weidner et al., 2019). However, although DL has been leading vision-related technological advancements in other industries such as automotive, no study to date has investigated the potential of integrating sophisticated DL architectures into dynamic rockfall database population processes.\n\n\n1.3\nDeep learning\nDL is a subfield of ML that involves structures and algorithms inspired by the function of the human brain. This process of learning from data using brain simulations is known as AI and the learning algorithms as deep neural networks (DNNs). The term \u201cdeep\u201d describes the development of neural networks with more than one hidden layer. For this reason, this approach to AI is called DL. The most crucial component in ML development is the data. DL algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input data distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features (Bengio, 2012). As such, it is important to ensure that the dataset contains representative real-world samples of the problem that is to be tackled.\nA DNN is composed of simple and highly interrelated processing units known as neurons, organized in multiple layers. The connections between the neurons are mathematically represented by trainable parameters called weights. Each neuron has the role of receiving an input signal, computing a non-linear activation function, and outputting a signal to the next layer. This process is called forward propagation. During training, the signal propagates until it produces the loss value (J(\u03b8)) defined by the selected loss function with respect to the training examples. The back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) is used to propagate the loss information backward through the network in order to compute the gradients. These gradients are then used by an optimization algorithm (optimizer) with the goal of adjusting the trainable weights to minimize the produced loss. This process can continue for multiple training epochs (steps) until a satisfying result is achieved. One training epoch is defined as a full pass (forward and backward) of all training data through the network.\nAs mentioned above, the idea of convolution layers in CNNs has revolutionized the task of image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2017). Recently, deep learning on point sets has been applied to deal with point cloud classification and segmentation problems as well. These architectures are divided into a) pointwise multi-layer perceptron (MLP), b) convolution-based, and c) graph-based methods. An extended survey on DL for 3D point clouds is provided by Guo et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nChange detection database\nA change detection database created from a 5-year long LiDAR-based monitoring program (DiFrancesco et al., 2020) was used for the optimization of the DL architectures within this study. It consists of 24 data acquisitions between 2013-11-28 and 2018-12-04 (Table 1\n). Change point clouds (resampled at 10\u00a0cm minimum point spacing) from time intervals ranging from 2 to 6\u00a0months are spatially clustered and filtered as discussed in DiFrancesco et al. (2020) to make sure that the database includes only changes corresponding to geological processes such as rockfall and talus movement. Subsequently, the individual point cloud clusters are meshed according to DiFrancesco et al. (2021) to generate 3D shapes (CAD models) of 8966 rock slope deformation volumes. These volumes are the result of surficial changes of at least 5\u00a0cm along the translation vector, deemed as the limit of detection threshold using methods by Lague et al. (2013). All the clusters are manually labeled as rockfall and non-rockfall instances, with reference to gigapixel photographs (Fig. 3\n) taken along with each LiDAR scan, and knowledge of the ongoing surface processes occurring at the site. The segmentation process was conducted in CloudCompare, by expert users, on high-end desktop machines which allowed for a fluid interaction with the data. The manual classifications (labels) were produced by the characterization of the source area of each cluster, resulting in 3466 rockfalls (38.7%). If the cluster was detached from an outcrop area (Fig. 3a) it was labeled as a rockfall. Situations of non-rockfalls include zones of talus accumulations (Fig. 3c) that subsequently move and appear as signatures of loss, areas of soil adjacent to the rock slope, as well as the deformation of on the slope individual rock blocks.\nHowever, due to the intervals between scans, the entire dataset includes uncertainty on whether all rockfall examples represent single events or result from cumulative volume loss caused by multiple events at the same location between successive scans (Williams et al., 2019). It is further assumed that the longer the scanning interval, the greater this uncertainty becomes. The same applies for non-rockfall clusters as well.\nGeologically, all the clusters come from the CN Rail Ashcroft Mile 109.4 engineered rock slope located in British Columbia, Canada, along the Fraser River (Fig. 4a). The site is 240\u00a0m long and approximately 65\u00a0m high. The stratigraphy consists of successive layers of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks including argillites, sandy siltstones, shales, sandstones, and conglomerates with shear zones and normal faults. The site has been experiencing rockfall activity that periodically interrupts train traffic on the underlying Canadian National rail lines. The rock slope is surrounded by soil slopes, above, and talus slopes resting on the rock shed which protects a section of the track. Deformations detected in these areas are not rockfall events. However, non-rockfall clusters sourced from features such as shear zones and rock benches formed by sub-horizontal discontinuity surfaces are more difficult to identify. These features create challenges in the labeling process and meticulous inspection of supportive multi-temporal ultra-high-resolution imagery is required.\nA second database from the west part of the White Canyon (WCW) in British Columbia, Canada is also utilized (Fig. 4b). The WCW is a geologically and geomorphologically different environment, with discrete geomorphologic features like large erosion channels traversing the slope. The White Canyon rock slopes are approximately 1000\u00a0m long and up to 300\u00a0m high. Large catchments allow for the accumulation of debris above and into deeply incised channels. Fluxes of debris are detected across weekly to seasonal change detection intervals, as elongated clusters of loss (Bonneau et al., 2019a, 2019b). The purpose of the inclusion of the WCW database is to examine both the generalization potential of the models developed with the Mile 109 database and the suitability of the proposed DL architecture to be used for site-specific applications. The intervals of the data acquisition campaigns are similar to Mile 109 and although the WCW database is larger due to the larger size of the site, not all the data were used for training. An equal amount of data was selected for both sites to facilitate comparison. This amount is similar to the data used in the original development and implementation of the 3D DL models (Qi et al., 2017a, 2017b).\n\n\n2.2\nDeep neural networks\nThe pioneering contributions in DL for 3D point clouds known as PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) and PointNet++ (Qi et al., 2017b) are utilized in this study. Both PointNet and PointNet++ architectures constitute point-based DL methods, which means that they work directly on 3D point coordinates instead of projecting an unstructured point cloud into 2D images (multi-view-based methods) or dividing the 3D space by voxelization (volumetric-based methods). The idea of the ancestor PointNet is to learn a feature representation for each point with several shared MLPs and then using a symmetric function to extract global point cloud signatures to be fed into a network of fully-connected layers responsible for the classification. PointNet is placed within the state-of-the-art neural networks in point cloud classification achieving an overall accuracy of 89.2% on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset (Wu et al., 2015), with 9843 shapes for training and 2468 for testing, and has been proven robust to small perturbation of points, outliers, and missing data.\nUsing PointNet as its basic building block, PointNet++ extends the learning from global point cloud signatures to the exploitation of local structure signatures induced by the metric. Similar to a typical CNN, PointNet++ is able to recursively map feature representations at increasingly larger scales providing a multi-resolution learning hierarchy. In PointNet++, multiple PointNet models as local feature learners are applied recursively to nested partitions of the point cloud to encode sets of local points into higher-level features. In more detail, the hierarchical learning structure of PointNet++ is composed of successive set abstraction levels. Each abstraction level includes:\n\n1.\nA sampling layer responsible for the selection of the level's local regions centroids.\n\n\n2.\nA grouping layer responsible for the construction of local point sets by \u201cball query\u201d searching around each centroid, and\n\n\n3.\nA PointNet layer to calculate the local regions' embeddings.\n\n\n\nPointNet++, which achieves an overall accuracy of 90.7% on the ModelNet40 dataset, supports two types of grouping namely single-scale grouping (SSG) and multi-scale grouping (MSG) within the abstraction levels (Fig. 5\n).\n\n2.2.1\nRockfall detection PointNet architecture\nIn this study, PointNet is implemented, with minor optimizations, to address the current rockfall detection as a binary classification task. These optimizations rely on the reduction of the model's capacity in terms of number and size (number of neurons) of layers as well as the final classification unit activation. Since the original high-capacity model is designed for training with a larger dataset and 40 output classes, it very quickly overfitted our change detection database when initially tested and therefore was considered too big for our problem.\nThe model directly consumes a set of n 3D points {P\n\ni\n| i\u00a0=\u00a01,\u2026,\nn}, where each point is a three-dimensional vector (x,y,z) and thus the input is a nx3-dimensional tensor. However, as mentioned above, it is important to make sure that the learnt representation of the input set is invariant to permutations and transformations. PointNet architecture tackles these two objectives by applying a symmetric function on transformed elements. First, it incorporates a mini-network called T-Net, to predict an affine transformation matrix that is applied to the input tensor by matrix multiplication. The T-Net is also used deeper in the network to predict a feature transformation matrix in order to enable the alignment of features from different input tensors. Second, the learnt global representations are aggregated by a max pooling function, invariant to the input order. In this way, the network learns to summarize a shape by a set of key points that form the skeleton of the captured object.\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 6\n, the Rockfall Detection PointNet architecture selected for the rockfall detection problem starts with passing the nx3-dimensional input tensor into the transformation network (T-Net). The T-Net consists of a MLP with two convolution layers of 16 and 32, respectively, a max pooling layer, and a final 16-sized dense layer. The T-Net output tensor is transformed into a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 affine transformation matrix that is applied to the input tensor by matrix multiplication. Then the model continues with a convolution layer with 16 neurons before the feature transformation module which transforms the T-Net output tensor into a 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 matrix to multiply the output of the previous layer. Subsequently, a 32-neuron convolution layer and a max pooling layer are employed to generate the global feature representation. By this point, the network learns how to map the shape of the seen cluster in a 32-dimensional vector. The binary classification is achieved by a typical two-layer fully-connected (16, 1). All the layers in the model incorporate the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as activation function except the final classification unit which is activated by a sigmoid function.\n\n\n2.2.2\nRockfall detection PointNet++ architecture\nSimilar to PointNet, the Rockfall Detection PointNet++ implementation differs from the original. We again reduced the capacity of the model since it overfitted the data in only a few epochs of training. The nx3-dimensional input tensor is passed into two successive abstraction levels and a final mini-PointNet with two convolution layers of 16 neurons each that results in the feature representation of the seen cluster. Finally, a MLP with three fully-connected layers (16-, 8, 1-sized) is used for the classification of the feature representation vector as either a rockfall or non-rockfall volume.\nIn the PointNet++ SSG model (Fig. 7\n), the set abstraction process includes the sampling of 32 points from each of 256 local regions of the shape at the first level, and their 16-dimensional encoding using PointNet. Subsequently, the second level samples 64 points from each of 128 local regions and encodes them into a 16-dimensional embedding too. In the PointNet++ MSG model, three increasing sampling scales are employed in each abstraction level. The first level samples 16, 16, and 32 points locally from 256 regions at each scale, while the second level samples 32, 32, and 64 points from 128 regions at each of the three scales. The mini-PointNet models used within Rockfall Detection PointNet++ include two convolution layers of 16 neurons each. As in PointNet, all the layers in PointNet++ implementation incorporate ReLU activations except the final sigmoid activation.\n\n\n2.2.3\nPre-processing\nIt is crucial in ML that the project is structured appropriately during the pre-processing step. For the development of our rockfall detection models we formed four subsets of the change detection database; one for training, one for development, and two for testing on different real-world scenarios within the monitoring program. The setup of the tests is one of the most important components since it represents a real instance of the problem that the model is designed for. The clusters from the last two data acquisition campaigns (ID: 23, 24) were kept out for the testing of the models on a real-world example of this monitoring program. The remainder of the clusters were divided for each class into 70% for training and 30% for development based on the change volume distribution. This logic is based on the observation that the larger the change volumes are, the more discrete the shapes become between rockfall and non-rockfall events, and thus, the easier the labeling is for a human. As such, the datasets were compiled to make sure that both training and development sets come from the same distribution and no such bias is induced in the training process. Specifically, equal number of training and development data were sampled from each of the bins of the volume histogram. Since rockfall and non-rockfall volume distributions are very similar, this also resulted in an approximately 40\u201360% class proportion between rockfall and non-rockfall clusters for each bin.\nAnother important pre-processing step is the preparation of the data as inputs to the neural network. A neural network architecture has explicit design with predefined input tensor size. In a rock slope monitoring program, there are multiple parameters that affect the point cloud density and subsequently the number of points in a detected rock slope deformation cluster. Also, within our rock slope deformation database, there is great variability in the cluster volume. As such, the individual rock slope deformations point clouds include a few to thousands of points - depending on the magnitude of the event. To comply with this and provide a fixed n-dimensional input to the neural network, without modifying the shape of a cluster, the input points are directly sampled uniformly from the triangular surfaces of the CAD model generated by meshing the raw data as shown in Fig. 8\n. The meshes are produced via surface reconstruction methods built on computational geometry described and used in DiFrancesco et al. (2021). The reconstructions were guaranteed to produce watertight manifold geometry, and were able to approximate the input clusters well, to be used for the generation of the 1024\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 input tensor.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nDevelopment and testing\nThe training-development (dev) as well as the testing processes are monitored and evaluated based on the binary cross entropy (BCE) loss (Eq. 1) and the accuracy (Eq. 2) defined as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nBCELoss\n=\n\u2212\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n0\n\nN\n\n\ny\ni\n\n\u2219\nlog\n\n\np\n\n\ny\ni\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ny\ni\n\n\n\n\u2219\nlog\n\n\n1\n\u2212\np\n\n\ny\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, y is the label (either 1 or 0) and p(y) is the predicted probability of an instance being class 1, and\n\n(2)\n\nAccuracy\n=\n\n\nTP\n+\nTN\n\n\nTP\n+\nTN\n+\nFP\n+\nFN\n\n\n\n\nwhere TP, TN, FP, and FN standing for true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions, respectively.\nIn general, there is an inversely proportional relationship between loss and accuracy. In interpretation, the loss defines how well the model \u201cunderstands\u201d the problem and the confidence it has in the predictions it is making while the accuracy defines the real-world implications. Table 2\n summarizes the train-dev-test scores after 1000 epochs of training the models on the Mile 109 dataset. It is observed that PointNet achieves the highest score on the test set, however, the test loss values are slightly higher compared to the PointNet++ models. The overall loss values indicate that rockfall detection based on the shape is a complex problem.\nThe visualizations of the results in Fig. 9\n illustrate that there is also difference in the distribution of the errors. By a visual assessment, the spatial pattern of predictions by PointNet in Fig. 9b seem to match the reference pattern (Fig. 9a) and the errors are associated mostly with small volume clusters. However, both the PointNet++\u2019s (SSG and MSG) seem to be making incorrect decisions for large volume clusters as well (Fig. 9c, d).\nTo increase the probability of working with single-event clusters, the second testing dataset was composed of clusters coming only from the data acquisition campaigns ID: 3, 5, and 8 which have inter-scan intervals of 10, 6, and 6\u00a0days, respectively (see Table 1). Due to the fact that these data were obtained more frequently, they are more likely to exclude accumulated clusters. The best-performing PointNet model achieved a 83.9% accuracy on the second test dataset. Since no large magnitude events occurred during the corresponding time-intervals, the relatively lower PointNet accuracy achieved is likely due to the dominance of small volume clusters.\nThe next evaluation step was to test the generalization capabilities of our AI. This includes the application of the trained weights of the best-performing PointNet model from Mile 109 to the WCW clusters. However, the model trained with the Mile 109 database clusters failed to solve the problem for the new site, identifying almost all the change clusters as rockfall events. This result was expected, due to the different scale of the changes between the two sites, in particular in the non-rockfall event data, and also due to the different rockmass structure and geometry. As a result of this finding, the architecture developed for the problem was applied to learn the shape characteristics of the WCW rock slope deformations. Table 3\n summarizes the train-dev-test scores after 1000 epochs of training the models on the WCW dataset. PointNet and PointNet++ MSG achieved an equivalently high accuracy of almost 93% on the test dataset. The loss values on the train and dev phase for PointNet indicate a smooth learning process while PointNet++ MSG loss increases by approximately 60% from training to development. This means that the model becomes less confident with its predictions which is reflected as a 1.5% accuracy decrease.\nThe WCW result visualizations in Fig. 10\n illustrate similarities with the erroneous predictions at Mile 109. PointNet predictions match the reference pattern (Fig. 10a) with the majority of non-rockfall clusters being sourced from the debris material within the channels and the rockfall events from the steep rock outcrop sections. On the other hand, both the PointNet++ (SSG and MSG) models make some obvious incorrect decisions in the channels (Fig. 9c, d). The above observations for both sites are quantified by the error analysis presented in the next section.\n\n\n3.2\nError analysis\nError analysis was conducted to provide insights regarding the models' ability to learn from the given data, what they can learn better, and what type of deformation clusters they struggle to understand. The analysis was carried out based on the confidence the models have on their predictions (expressed as loss) with respect to the volume of the input clusters. The volume spectrum was divided into four classes with clusters <0.01, 0.01\u20130.1, 0.1\u20131, and\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0m3 and the median loss was calculated for the predictions corresponding to each class.\nThe error analysis results are provided in the two bar charts in Fig. 11\n for Mile 109 and WCW, respectively. The distributions validate the visual observations on Figs. 9 and 10. The PointNet++ models are significantly less confident in their predictions than PointNet for both sites. Usually, loss values >0.1 do not represent an optimum learning and values over 1 are not acceptable. In the WCW case most of the errors are between 0.1 and 1\u00a0m3 of volume. On the other hand, median loss shows that PointNet predictions increase their confidence as the volume increases for at least 50% of the corresponding clusters. The latter is clearly evident in the Mile 109 case and follows the expected confidence trend of the human level performance in identifying rockfall clusters from volumetric optical material.\n\n\n\n4\nSummary and discussion\nLiDAR technology has been widely used for rockfall monitoring worldwide. It is implemented to extract valuable information regarding rockfall source and deposition locations as well as their volume and shape derived from surface reconstructions. In addition, it opens new prospects for further advancements in rockfall risk management like AI development. Ideally, an AI may be able to project future potential new rockfall locations based on the continuous decoding of spatio-temporal rockfall patterns, as the monitoring operates. Such a model must first be able to understand what a rockfall looks like and detect it within 3D optical material such as point cloud data. Rockfall detection is a challenging task. To \u201cteach\u201d a model what is a rockfall, it must be provided with examples of both rockfall and non-rockfall events. For this purpose, we examined state-of-the-art DL models that have previously proven able to detect instances among 40 classes of every-day objects. In the rockfall detection case however, we get algorithms to accomplish a task for which human level performance has not been assessed. Disagreements on identifying what represents a rockfall by inspecting multi-temporal optical material may exist even between experts, especially for the tiny clusters. Therefore, it is rather challenging to set a performance threshold for an acceptable model.\nInspired by the advancements in other industries such as automotive, this research investigated the potential of DL and computer vision algorithms to complement LiDAR monitoring programs and provide support towards the development of AI-based rockfall risk management solutions with sequence models in the \u2013 near(?) \u2013 future. However, this effort has to keep up with the fact that classification problems in engineering geology require deep understanding of the phenomena and the semantics involved \u2013 which may not be universally accepted in all cases \u2013 in comparison to the automotive industry where almost any human being can perceive what a traffic light looks like. Thereafter, in this case it is challenging even to claim that a training dataset is perfect. After manual expert-based classification, two large rock slope deformation databases from geologically and geomorphologically different sites were used for the purposes of this research. The goal was to initially define the suitable learning architecture and train a model based on the data of one site and subsequently test the generalization ability of the trained model as well as the site-specific training of the same architecture. Although unique in size and duration, one limitation that might exist in these databases is the uncertainty on whether each cluster represents a single event. This comes from the fact that the sites are not monitored continuously and there might be instances where a cluster is essentially an accumulation of deformations sourced from the very same location. The data were therefore curated accordingly to make sure that the models are evaluated at real-world scenarios of these two rockfall monitoring setups. All the neural networks were trained on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU with Tensorflow 2 deep learning framework in Ubuntu 18.04 operating system.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe outcome of this research is promising regarding the potential for AI to be applied to attempt to prevent property and life loss from rockfalls in the future. Rockfall detection comprises the cornerstone for the development of an AI-based early-warning system and LiDAR and DL can be the building blocks. Three point-based learning architectures with different characteristics were evaluated. The first architecture (PointNet) aims to understand rockfall shape characteristics by \u201clooking\u201d at the shape of each cluster as a whole and learning global feature representations. The other two architectures, PointNet++ SSG and PointNet++ MSG, focus on the understanding of the texture of each cluster by learning feature representations from local regions of the shape. The difference is that SSG groups local feature representations from one sampling scale at each level, while MSG can group features from multiple sampling scales imitating convolutional operations.\nThe Rockfall Detection PointNet architecture was proven suitable for the task at both the examined sites with accuracies fluctuating around and above 90%. It is concluded that rockfalls can be better separated from non-rockfall clusters by learning their overall shape characteristics instead of focusing on the local texture. Since the non-rockfall volumes represent rockfalls that were once detached, they are composed of the same material and thus the texture does not provide any discriminating value. Instead, global shape encoding of rockfall clusters inherits signs of the failure mechanism. This is also validated by the fact that PointNet errors are dominantly related to small volumes while the PointNet++ models make incorrect decisions on large volume deformations too, which might lead to an underestimation of the hazard. Rockfall detection, therefore, is not a straightforward classification problem and a balance between accuracy and error volume distribution should be considered when training DL algorithms for rockfall detection.\nFurthermore, the study shows that it is challenging to achieve generalization in rockfall detection even with DL, which has proven its strengths in vision problems for other types of datasets. There might be a need for more and diverse training data to tackle the generalization challenge. However, site-specific DL-based rockfall detection with PointNet is highly encouraged by the results of the current study over two geologically and geomorphologically different rock slope databases. In addition, the study shows that a dataset of around 6000 events could be sufficient to provide good learning of the problem with the proposed neural network. Although human labeling variability in the task is not known, PointNet results with >90% accuracy and errors within the lower part of the volume spectrum, are anticipated to be very close to human-level performance.\n\n","1":"","2":"","3":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRockfall is a frequent natural hazard in steep, mountainous environments endangering settlements and infrastructure (Guzzetti, 2000; Loew et al., 2021). Its occurrence is affected by many uncertainties and thus hardly predictable. For this reason, together with the generally high impact intensities, rockfall causes high costs compared to other landslide types (Arnold and Dorren, 2015; Ferrari et al., 2016). A realistic quantification of rockfall risk is crucial for an effective and efficient prevention of economic damages and loss of lives. Although rockfall trajectory models allow for an increasingly precise calculation of rockfall runout zones and the kinetic energies of blocks (Agliardi and Crosta, 2003; Bourrier et al., 2009; Dorren et al., 2006; Christen et al., 2012), the estimation of realistic block and event volumes as well as their release frequencies remain a major challenge. They are often based on one or several scenarios which represent estimates of different event magnitudes (release volumes) and return periods, based on geological surveys of the rock cliff and (scarce) inventory data. In the past, a few analyses of rockfall frequencies based on long-term historical inventories have been published (e.g., Hungr et al., 1999; Dussauge-Peisser et al., 2002; Eckert et al., 2020; Melzner et al., 2020). De Biagi et al. (2017) combined the analysis of available historical data with a survey of detached blocks in a probabilistic method to determine the rockfall magnitude-frequency relationship. The problem with inventory data is that i) observation periods are often short and thus the statistical representativeness is questionable (Hantz et al., 2020) and that ii) they are usually registered at the element at risk and often only in case of damages and, thus, rather represent the occurrence frequency at the element at risk than the release frequency. However, release frequencies are required to realistically quantify the rockfall risk for a specific element at risk and for a variation of propagation settings (e.g., with or without protection measures) (Lari et al., 2014; Moos et al., 2018). Other approaches are based on the analysis of remotely sensed data (e.g., Guerin et al., 2014; van Veen et al., 2018; Umili et al., 2020) or dendrogeomorphological analyses (Mainieri et al., 2019; Stoffel et al., 2005). Farvacque et al. (2021) proposed a method to estimate rockfall release frequency combining field-based data from rockfall protection barriers and tree-ring records of past rockfall activity with process-based modeling approaches. They found a good agreement between release frequencies determined from tree-ring analyses and obtained from rock deposits in the protection barriers. However, the mentioned approaches are often very cost- and time-intensive and\/or rely on a large amount of (often unavailable) data and are, thus, not applicable in current practice. Engineering consultancies in charge of hazard assessments are generally limited in time and resources and thus rely on straightforward approaches and methods to determine rockfall release frequencies. These, however, often sacrifice in accuracy and objectivity.\nBased on the analysis of the rockfall frequency and magnitude in a range of rock cliffs, Hantz et al. (2020) and Loew et al. (2021) proposed a power law based model for the determination of rockfall magnitude-frequency relationships aiming at a more objective approach for practitioners. It assumes that both, the releasing masses of rockfall events as well as the individual blocks of a rockfall event resulting from first fracturing follow a power law distribution. The parameters of these distributions are determined using a simple classification of rock structure in combination with field measurements of blocks. In this study, we applied and tested the proposed rockfall frequency model (RFM) at 8 different sites at 7 locations in the Swiss Alps. The calculated frequencies of rockfall events and the derived block volumes were compared to release scenarios of official hazard assessments. Additionally, the sensitivity and uncertainty of the derived rockfall scenarios regarding the parameters of the RFM were assessed.\n\n\n2\nRockfall frequency model\nThe frequency of the detachment of rockfall events (hereafter called \u201crelease frequency\u201d) is subject to a wide range of uncertainties and can hardly be predicted in a deterministic way. Thus, statistical models are often used to approximate the onset frequency of a rockfall event of a given size. Power law distributions have been proven to fit well the magnitude-frequency relationship of the released rockfall events and the released blocks, respectively (Hungr et al., 1999; Dussauge-Peisser et al., 2002). The spatio-temporal release frequency of rockfall events (introduced by Hantz et al., 2003a) can be expressed as:\n\n(1)\n\n\nF\nst\n\n\nV\n\n=\n\nA\nst\n\n\nV\n\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFst(V) is the number of rockfall events releasing per year and hectare. Ast represents the activity of the rock cliff and corresponds to the frequency of rockfall events with a volume\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0m3 per hectare of the rock cliff. B characterizes the volume distribution and depends on the geological structure. It mainly varies between 0.4 and 0.8 (Brunetti et al., 2009). Eq. 1 applies up to a maximum possible rockfall volume, which depends on the size and the geological structure of the rock cliff.\nBy multiplying Fst with the surface S of the rock cliff, we get the temporal frequency of the considered cliff Ft(V):\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\nt\n\n\nV\n\n=\nS\n\u00d7\n\nA\nst\n\n\nV\n\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume of a rockfall can be determined by comparing the pre-failure and post-failure surfaces in the cliff or by estimating the volume of the deposit of an event. A rockfall event is defined as the detachment of a rock volume between two different points in time. Van Veen et al. (2017) and Williams et al. (2019) pointed out that neighboring events occurring within a single monitoring interval are often recorded as one. Thus, the volumes of the rockfalls occurred in a cliff and their distribution depend on the monitoring interval, which must be considered by the users of a rockfall volume-frequency relation.\nA rockfall event is generally composed of fragments. The volume distribution of these single blocks can also be approximated with a power law distribution (e.g., Hantz et al., 2016; Ruiz-Carulla et al., 2017; Moos et al., 2018):\n\n(3)\n\n\nf\nst\n\n\nv\n\n=\n\na\nst\n\n\nv\n\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\nwhere f\n\nst\n is the release frequency of blocks per year and hectare. The parameter a corresponds to the number of blocks larger than 1 m3 per year and hectare. The uniformity parameter b is generally larger than the parameter B of the event distribution (between 0.5 and 1.5; Mavrouli et al., 2015).\n\n2.1\nFrequency distribution of blocks\nBy integrating the volume-frequency relationship of the rockfall events over the frequency with consideration of a maximum possible rockfall volume, the retreat rate R of the cliff can be calculated (Eq. 4; Hantz et al., 2003b, 2020). The latter describes the total eroded volume of a cliff per time and surface of the cliff (in mmyr\u22121). It is usually assessed based on inventory data (e.g., Allen et al., 2011), comparisons of historical and recent photographs (e.g., Ravanel and Deline, 2010) or laser scanning (e.g., Mohadjer et al., 2020).\n\n(4)\n\nR\n=\n\n\nA\nst\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\nV\nMAX\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nA\nst\n\nB\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\nV\nMIN\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVMIN is the minimum considered volume and V\n\nMAX\n the maximum possible volume. By considering a maximum possible rockfall volume, rare events are taken into account (assuming the power law is valid up to this volume). Analogously, the retreat rate can be calculated from the volume-frequency relationship of the block volumes:\n\n(5)\n\n\nR\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\na\nst\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\nv\nMAX\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\na\nst\n\nb\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\nv\nMIN\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith v\n\nMAX\n being the maximum possible block volume and v\n\nMIN\n the minimum considered block volume. The integration of the block volumes is not always convergent for a volume of 0 m3 (because b can be bigger than 1) and, thus, minimum block and event volumes have to be determined. In case the parameters A\n\nst\n\n, B, V\n\nMAX\n and b are known, the parameter a\n\nst\n can be calculated by equating the two retreat rates:\n\n(6)\n\nast\n=\n\n\nR\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nMAX\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\u2212\nb\n\nv\nMIN\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above explained model allows for characterizing the frequency distribution of block volumes. It is an \u201coverall frequency\u201d including the blocks theoretically falling during all potential rockfall events. It is obvious that the large number of blocks in the very big and rare events strongly influence the block volume frequency. This exemplifies that block releases are not independent events, and their onset probability cannot be modelled using a Poisson or binomial distribution (Hantz et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.2\nFrequency of rockfall events and maximum block volumes\nBesides the overall release frequency of blocks, the frequency of rockfall events including at least one block of a given minimum volume or, inversely, the maximum block volume for a given rockfall frequency are of particular interest in hazard management. For this, it is necessary to determine the maximum probable block volume (and the number of blocks of this volume) as a function of the rockfall event volume.\nThe volume V of a rockfall event can be obtained by integrating the volumes of the individual blocks between a minimum volume v\n\nMIN\n and the maximum possible volume v\n\nMAX\n (regardless of V; Eq. 7). The minimum block volume must be strictly positive since the integral would not converge for b >\u00a01 if v\n\nMIN\n\u00a0=\u00a00. Thus, we assume that the rockfall volumes are estimated by counting only the blocks with volumes bigger than v\n\nMIN\n.\n\n(7)\n\nV\n=\n\na\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\nv\nMAX\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\nv\nMIN\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a given rockfall volume V and a known b value, the parameter a is:\n\n(8)\n\na\n=\n\n\nV\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nMAX\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\u2212\nb\n\nv\nMIN\n\n1\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy calculating the parameter a for a given rockfall volume V and b value, the block volume distribution can be known. If n(v\n\nMAX\n)\u00a0>\u00a01, the number of blocks with volume vMAX in the rockfall event is the integer part of a*v\n\nMAX\n\n-b\n. If n(v\n\nMAX\n)\u00a0<\u00a01, the biggest occurring block has a volume v\n\nmax\n\n(V)\u00a0=\u00a0a\n\n1\/b\n, which is lower than v\n\nMAX\n (Fig. 1\n).\nIn hazard and risk analysis, rockfall and block volumes are usually required for a set of scenarios of different return periods (or frequencies). The rockfall volume of a given frequency F\n\nt\n can be calculated based on the rockfall frequency distribution (Eq. 2):\n\n(9)\n\nV\n\n\nF\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nAst\n\u2217\nS\n\n\nF\nt\n\n\n\n\n1\n\/\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that V(F\n\nt\n\n) is a function of B that is decreasing if (A\n\nst\n\n*S\/F\n\nt\n)\u00a0>\u00a01 or increasing if (A\n\nst\n\n*S\/F\n\nt\n)\u00a0<\u00a01. It must be checked that V(F\n\nt\n\n) is smaller than the maximum possible rockfall volume (V\n\nMAX\n).\nFor the rockfall volume of frequency F\n\nt\n, the number of blocks of v\n\nMAX\n (in case n(v\n\nMAX\n)\u00a0>\u00a01) or the volume of the largest occurring block v\n\nmax\n (in case n(v\n\nMAX\n)\u00a0<\u00a01) can then be calculated. In this study, we calculated event and block volumes for four return periods of 10\u00a0yrs. (F\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a01\/10), 30\u00a0yrs. (F\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a01\/30), 100\u00a0yrs. (F\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a01\/100) and 300\u00a0yrs. (F\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a01\/300).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nParameter estimation\n\n3.1.1\nMaximum possible rockfall volume and maximum block volume\nThe maximum possible volume of a rockfall V\n\nmax\n has to be considered if the rockfall volume-frequency relationship is extrapolated to rare events. It depends on the size of the rock wall (height, width), its morphology (slope angle and aspect) and on the structure of the rock mass (dips, dip direction, size and spacing of the discontinuities). Corominas et al. (2018) presented two standard approaches to assess the maximum possible (or credible) rockfall event, which can be bigger than the largest event of a potentially available historical inventory. The first one (inductive) consists in searching morphological evidence of passed rockfall events (deposits and scars left at the source). It allows for considering a period that is longer than the one covered by the historical inventory, but which is nevertheless limited. The second approach (deductive) consists in defining the maximum rockfall volume from the available data on the topography and internal structure of the rock cliff. The structure can be considered either statistically (identification of discontinuity sets) or deterministically (identification of individual potential sliding planes). Examples are given in Jaboyedoff et al. (2009), Mavrouli et al. (2015), Corominas et al. (2018) and Jaboyedoff et al. (2020).\nHere we propose a simple method based on Hoek and Bray (1981) to be used when the geological structure is barely known. The model assumes a critical plane (or wedge) that outcrops at the base of the slope and a simplified geometry of the slope to determine the maximum possible volume of a slide. The critical sliding surface can be determined from a structural analysis of the rock mass (Fig. 2a). When there is no structural analysis, we assume that sliding may occur on a plane having the minimum dip (to maximize the sliding volume), but which is sufficient for sliding to occur (Fig. 2b). We propose values of this \u201cminimum slide dip\u201d based on the surface condition of the potential sliding plane (or wedge) as defined by Hoek and Marinos (2000), Marinos and Hoek (2001) and Hoek et al. (2005) (Table 1\n). It can be adjusted based on expert judgment. It is important to note that for sliding planes with low dips (10\u00b0- 20\u00b0), the hypothesis of an infinite extension is too conservative because a tension crack usually bounds the sliding mass. The width of the biggest possible slide is assumed to equal the rock wall height, since a plane slide is rarely much wider than height (Frayssines and Hantz, 2006). Rockfall may also result from a topple. However, it can be assumed that the maximum rockfall volume resulting from a topple is smaller than the maximum rockfall volume resulting from a slide. It has to be noted that the simple method proposed here is conservative and may also include rockslides in the scenarios. The latter typically show another behavior compared to rockfall and, thus, should be treated separately in risk assessments. However, the maximum event volume predominantly influences the overall block frequency in the proposed model (Eq. 4\u20136), but it does not influence the calculation of the rockfall event volumes of a given return period and the associated number of blocks (Eq. 8\u20139) as it was applied in this study.\nThe maximum block volume was estimated by expert judgment based on the block volume samples measured in the field and inventory data of past rockfall events. It could also be estimated based on the structure of the rock mass (Mavrouli et al., 2015).\n\n\n3.1.2\nParameters Ast and B\nThe parameter A\n\nst\n shows the activity of the cliff and B determines the uniformity of the rockfall volume distribution and depends on the rock wall structure. It was determined following the classification proposed by Hantz et al. (2020), who analyzed the rockfall frequency in anaclinal limestone cliffs and a gneissic cliff in non-permafrost areas of the Alps. The rockfall frequencies in these cliffs were at such a low level that very few neighboring events were recorded as one with a monitoring interval of one year. In the classification, six main structure types are distinguished (Fig. 3\n). The parameter A\n\nst\n depends on the spacing of the main joint set of the rock wall (Hantz et al., 2020). The analyses of inventory data imply that a metric distance of the spacing corresponds to a A\n\nst\n value between 0.01 and 0.1 and a decimetric distance to a A\n\nst\n value between 0.1 and 1. Ast can be estimated using the following equation (Hantz et al., 2020):\n\n(10)\n\n\nA\nst\n\n=\n\n10\n\n\u2212\nlog\n\n\n10\n\u2217\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhereas s is the average spacing of the main joint set in the rock wall.\n\n\n3.1.3\nParameter b\nThe uniformity parameter b of the block volume distribution was determined based on block volume samples collected in the field. For each case study site, we sampled blocks along transects in the deposition area. Depending on the size of the deposition area, one or several down-slope transects following the mean trend of trajectories with a length of 20\u00a0m were determined, aiming at a realistic representation of the block size distribution including areas with smaller and larger blocks (following Ruiz-Carulla et al., 2015; Fig. 4\n). Along this transect, all blocks with a volume\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.05\u00a0m3 were measured for a transect width of 2\u00a0m. To calculate the volume of a block, we measured three edges of the block and determined a correction factor (f) for the block volume compared to a perfect cube. For Orvin and T\u00e4sch, we used already available block samples from a recent study (Moos et al., 2018). We then fitted a power law distribution to the measured volumes based on least squares to derive parameter b. The degree of precision of the estimates of the parameter b was determined through a bootstrap analysis (Bengoubou-Val\u00e9rius and Gibert, 2013; De Biagi et al., 2017). We fitted the parameter b for 10\u2032000 bootstrap samples of the block volumes and determined the 95%-confidence intervals of the estimates.\n\n\n\n3.2\nTest sites\nThe RFM was elaborated and tested for eight rock cliffs at seven locations in Switzerland (Fig. 5\n). The sites were selected based on the following criteria:\n\ni)\nThe rock cliffs have different lithologies;\n\n\nii)\nThere are block deposits on the slope;\n\n\niii)\nThere are existing official hazard assessments available and if possible, inventory data on past events.\n\n\n\nThree of the sites are in the canton of Valais (Swiss Western Alps), one in the canton of Bern (Jura), one in the canton of Grisons (Swiss Eastern Alps) and two in the canton of Ticino (Swiss Southern Alps). The main characteristics and available data are summarized in Table 2\n. The scenarios of the official hazard assessment are mainly expert based with large differences in the underlying data basis. Images of the release areas can be found in Appendix A.\n\n\n3.3\nSensitivity and uncertainty analysis\nWe quantified the uncertainty and sensitivity regarding the parameters A\n\nst\n, B, b, V\n\nMAX\n and v\n\nMAX\n and the surface of the cliff S for the calculated release scenarios based on a Monte Carlo approach. We determined the following \u201cerror margins\u201d for the parameters based on expert judgment:\nAst: variation by a factor 2 (1\/2*Ast - 2*Ast).\nB: variation by +\/\u2212 0.2 (one class width; Fig. 3).\nS: Variation by +\/\u2212 20%.\nb: variation between lower and upper bound of the bootstrap confidence intervals (see section 2.3.3).\nvMAX: variation by +\/\u2212 30%.\nVMAX: variation by \u2013 50% (calculated Vmax is regarded as the upper possible limit).\nAt each iteration of the Monte Carlo analysis, parameter values were randomly sampled from these ranges following a uniform distribution and the rockfall volume (V(F\n\nt\n\n)) and the maximum block volume v\n\nmax\n\n(F\n\nt\n\n) were calculated. This was repeated 10,000 times. Finally, we calculated the mean, median and standard deviation of the derived rockfall event and block volumes.\nTo determine the contribution of each parameter to the overall output uncertainty, we used the least square linearization (LSL; Lei and Schilling (1996)). LSL splits output uncertainty into its sources based on a multiple regression between the parameter deviation from the mean and the output (Verbeeck et al., 2006). It enables calculating uncertainty coefficients of all parameters, based on which they can be ranked regarding their influence on the overall output uncertainty.\n\n\n3.4\nComparison to hazard scenarios\nA major challenge of implementing the RFM is its validation since data on past events is generally missing or of insufficient quantity or quality. The rockfall release scenarios determined in this study were compared to i) release scenarios of official hazard analyses determined by engineering consultancies; ii) release frequencies determined based on a combination of dendrogeomorphological analyses and rockfall deposits published in a recent study for the sites Orvin and T\u00e4sch (Moos et al., 2018). The available data and applicable validation approaches per site are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nParameter estimations\nThe parameter A\n\nst\n was estimated between 0.05\u00a0yr\u22121\u00a0ha\u22121 (Bodio; Table 3\n) and 0.3\u00a0yr\u22121\u00a0ha\u22121 (Fl\u00e4sch 1 & 2; Nax). The parameter B ranged between 0.5 (Bodio) and 0.9 (Nax). The maximum possible volumes were estimated between 8000 m3 (Morcote) and 680\u2032000\u00a0m3 (Nax; Table 3).\nThe block size distributions of all sites were well captured by the power law distributions (R2 between 0.82 and 0.98). The fitted b values vary between 0.69 (Bodio; Table 3 and Fig. 6\n) and 1.69 (Nax). The uncertainty associated with the b estimates, as represented by the bootstrap confidence intervals in Table 3, substantially increases with decreasing block sample size (e.g., Morcote and Nax). There seems to be a tendency that b values are higher for limestone and dolomite compared to gneiss. Furthermore, b tends to increase with increasing B (Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n4.2\nRelease scenarios\nThe calculated block and event scenarios are reported in Table 4\n and Fig. 8-10\n\n\n for the different return periods. For the small return periods, the block sizes are usually in a comparable range with the scenarios of the official hazard assessment, but generally slightly larger. The difference increases with the return period (Fig. 8). For all sites, the standard deviations calculated by means of the Monte Carlo simulations are relatively high, indicating a large parameter sensitivity (Table 4). The variability of the event and block volumes also substantially increases with the return period (Figs. 9 & 10). For certain sites, the maximum possible block volume is already reached for return periods of 30\u2013100\u00a0years, leading to an \u201casymptotic\u201d trend in Fig. 10 (e.g., Fl\u00e4sch 1 or Bodio). Tthe highest sensitivity of the block volumes was found to parameter B and partially the parameter Ast as well as the cliff size for return periods of 100 and 300\u00a0years. The event volumes are also most sensitive to parameter B except for the sites of Morcote and Orvin (Fig. 11\n).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and conclusion\nDetermining realistic rockfall release frequencies is crucial for an adequate assessment of rockfall risk. Practitioners derive rockfall release scenarios often rather subjectively and uniform approaches and concepts are generally missing. The rockfall frequency model (RFM) applied in this study provides an objective and transparent approach to derive magnitude-frequency relationships of rockfall events and individual blocks even if historical inventories are missing or insufficient. It also allows for the determination of the frequency of rockfalls with at least one block with a minimum volume. It is a promising alternative to merely expert-based approaches for the following reasons: i) It requires only few parameters that are estimated based on simple schemes. This is a perfect precondition for its practical implementation; ii) the RFM assumes that the magnitude-frequency relationships for rockfall events and the individual blocks of an event can be characterized by a power law distribution. A wide range of studies evidence that this assumption is rather realistic (e.g., Hungr et al., 1999; Dussauge-Peisser et al., 2002; Ruiz-Carulla et al., 2015; Hantz et al., 2016), implying that the resulting frequencies are reliable. The comparison to the official hazard assessments in this study showed that this is not necessarily the case for the expert-based rockfall scenarios, where volume distributions were partially rather arbitrary; iii) the RFM provides an explicit quantification of the release frequency, whereas approaches based on inventories at the element at risk (e.g., De Biagi et al., 2017) only allow for the determination of the occurrence frequency at the elements at risk. Knowing the release frequency enables evaluating rockfall risk for different propagation scenarios, which is particularly relevant for hazard and risk assessments evaluating protection measures.\nThe block volume distributions of all study sites were well represented by power law distributions, indicating the scale invariant character of rock fragmentation (Turcotte, 1986). The fitted b values lay in a range that is similar to the range reported by Hantz et al. (2020) (0.47, 1.37), except the b value for Nax that is significantly higher (1.69). This suggests that dolomite gives a more uniform block volume distribution than the other rocks reported by Hantz et al. (2020). Two sites (Nax, Fl\u00e4sch 1) have higher b values compared to the range (0.63\u20131.29) obtained by Lanfranconi et al. (2020), who also found a different trend in the lithology dependence. The value of the parameter b depends mainly on the geology of the cliff, and fragmentation is often caused by fracturing along pre-existing weak joint planes (e.g., Lin et al., 2022). Additionally, the fall height of the blocks plays a role (De Blasio and Crosta, 2015; Ruiz Carulla et al., 2016). Surprising is the large difference of the b values of the two neighboring sites Fl\u00e4sch 1 (b\u00a0=\u00a00.77) and 2 (b\u00a0=\u00a01.45). They, however, differ in their lithology, which could explain the differing fragmentation behavior. While Fl\u00e4sch 1 is composed of siliceous limestone (with partly marly rocks), Fl\u00e4sch 2 is composed of limestone breccia and marly rocks. Furthermore, the block sample size of Fl\u00e4sch 1 is distinctly smaller than for Fl\u00e4sch 2, which could have led to a bias in the estimation.\nThe method used in this study for taking block samples in the field is a simplification of the approach proposed by Ruiz-Carulla et al. (2015). It is little time-consuming, easy to implement and requires only a couple of hours per site, depending on the site characteristics and accessibility and assuming that a sufficient number of deposited blocks is available. The comparison of fitted b values for different transects at two sites (Appendix B) exemplifies that the representativeness of the selected transects for the total block size distribution is more important than the number of measured blocks. It is thus difficult to indicate a minimum number of blocks to be measured. In case of large screes, measuring multiple transects representing different homogeneous deposition zones (cf. Ruiz-Carulla et al., 2015) is required. The comparison of the b and B values indicates a positive relationship between the two parameters, meaning that an increasing fracturing of the rock mass (increasing B) also results in a stronger fragmentation of the released volumes. Pursuing the systematic assessment of b values for other sites and for different geologies will possibly underpin potential relationships between the parameters and the main geological units.\nThe temporal frequencies and the volumes for different return periods depend on the release area and they increase with the considered cliff width. The comparison with the scenarios of the hazard assessments shows that the latter not always considered or underestimated the influence of the cliff size, since the difference between the RFM scenarios and the scenarios of the hazard assessments increase with increasing cliff size. The temporal frequencies and the volumes for different return periods depend on the height and the width of the considered cliff. Usually, the entire height of the cliff has to be considered, whereas the width to consider depends on the element at risk, which is not necessarily affected by the entire width of the cliff. For example, it may be the length of a road that run under the cliff. The occurrence frequency for different block volumes at the element at risk finally depends on their spatio-temporal release frequencies and their probabilities of reaching the element at risk (e.g., Corominas et al., 2005; Hantz et al., 2016, 2017, 2021; Moos et al., 2018).\nIn case the RFM takes rare events into account or if the long-term erosion rate of a cliff shall be estimated, it is further necessary to estimate a maximum possible rockfall volume. We here used a rather simple approach since little data on the cliff structure was available. Mavrouli and Corominas (2020) proposed a probabilistic methodology to assess the penetration of sliding planes into the slope, which is expected to deliver more precise results.\nThe sensitivity and uncertainty analysis revealed a high variability of the release scenarios with respect to the parameters of the RFM, increasing with the return period. Both, the rockfall event volumes and the block volumes, are particularly sensitive to the parameter B. Only the sites of Morcote and Orvin had the largest uncertainty coefficients for the parameter A\n\nst\n for return periods between 10 and 100\u00a0yrs. This can be explained by the relatively small cliff sizes of these sites and thus an increasing V(F\n\nt\n\n) with increasing B for small return periods (see Eq. 9 and Appendix C).\nVariations in the range of one or half a class width in the structure classification scheme for the determination of parameter B can result in large variations of the rockfall or block volume, especially for rare events (return period >100\u00a0yrs.; Appendix C). A more unambiguous and simple applicable method to determine parameter B is required for a practical implementation of the RFM. Additionally, the B parameters have to be further tested for their validity, since the classification scheme was developed based on inventory data from different sites in France, mainly limestone cliffs (Hantz et al., 2020) and might not be equally valid for the considered sites.\nThe main drawback of the here proposed rockfall frequency model is the difficulty to validate it properly since long-term measurements of release frequencies are generally rare. The expert-based release scenarios used for comparison in this study are themselves subject to many uncertainties and thus cannot be regarded as \u201ctrue value\u201d. A comparison to inventory data is also difficult since the rarely available data series are generally short and incomplete. Furthermore, information on block\/event volumes is often unprecise (i.e., only estimated in classes or unclear whether block or event volume). Finally, rockfall inventories usually cover only events in the deposition area (or even only events that caused damages) and are thus rather representative for the occurrence frequency at the element at risk and not the release frequency. Nevertheless, the RFM is a promising and straightforward method to determine rockfall release scenarios where inventory data is scarce. Further testing at a wide variety of sites and for long-term observations (in the best case) could help increasing its robustness.\n\n\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nChina is a mountainous country with a large population (Liu et al., 2015). In mountainous areas, geological hazards, such as rockfalls and rockslides, occur frequently that cause extensive damage to not only human lives and properties but also important infrastructure projects (Wang et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2020). Among these hazards, rockfalls are a type of hazards that occur frequently in mountainous areas and have the characteristics of high energy and mobility, which is difficult to predict and is prone to cause disasters (Ferrero et al., 2016). In the present study, we carry out analysis of the rockfall under special engineering geological conditions while combining a Chinese major engineering project \u201cSichuan\u2013Tibet Railway\u201d in operation.\nThe Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway is a railroad connecting Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and Lhasa City, Tibet Province in China with a total length of 1800\u00a0km (Wang et al., 2020). This transportation corridor runs through the Tibetan Plateau, with an overall geological performance of high seismic intensity, high ground stress, and high influences by freezing weathers as well as high and steep slopes (Zou et al., 2017). This study focuses on features with extremely high and steep rock slopes to analyze rockfalls in this particular area. Specifically, the tunnel portal of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway is threatened by rockfalls above it when crossing canyons. The tunnel portal is extremely high, which is unreachable for investigators, not to mention the initiation area of rockfalls above. Consequently, the characterization of the investigated rock slopes and subsequent rockfall analysis become much more challenging than traditional methodologies (Ma et al., 2014; Fanos and Pradhan, 2019).\nRock slopes encountered along the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway are particularly different from common slopes, and their extreme height makes the investigations of topographies and collections of discontinuities rather difficult. To overcome the problem mentioned above, recent developments on non-contact measurements, such as close-range photogrammetry, terrestrial laser scanning technique, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, have provided the ability to obtain the georeferenced information of terrain data and discontinuities from reconstructed 3D point clouds. However, the inaccessibility of high and steep slopes results in the difficult deployment of instrumentations for the aforementioned methods, making UAV photogrammetry the only way to conduct photogrammetric surveys with characteristics of easy-operation and timesaving (Salvini et al., 2011; Spreafico et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019). In previous works, UAV photogrammetry technique integrated with structure from motion (SfM) was efficiently utilized for discontinuity analysis and unstable block (discontinuity as the boundary) interpretation (Bordehore et al., 2017; Riquelme et al., 2017; Menegoni et al., 2019; Francioni et al., 2020), with applications to rockfall analysis (Macciotta et al., 2015; Ruiz-Carulla et al., 2017; Corominas et al., 2018; Sarro et al., 2018). However, the photography direction and large task distance of photogrammetry techniques currently used prevent the application along the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway. In this research, a new remote sensing technique, nap-of-the-object photogrammetry (Liang et al., 2020), was used to perform photogrammetric surveys and rock structure analysis with features of close task distance and variable shooting direction.\nThe tunnel portal of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway is threatened by the rockfalls above. Therefore, understanding the trajectories of rockfalls and acquiring kinematic parameters, including velocity, kinetic energy, and jump height, are crucial for providing railway construction advice (Hibert et al., 2017). Existing research proposes an empirical method, a physical model experiment method, and a modeling with numerical simulation methods to perform rockfall analysis. However, the empirical method is based on a probabilistic approach, and it should be used as a guideline, rather than a precision tool (Alejano et al., 2008). The physical model experiment method is limited by the scale of the experiment and the inability to simulate real topographies; therefore, the kinematic parameters acquired sometimes differ significantly from the real values (Tan et al., 2018). Modeling with a numerical simulation method, including 2D and 3D modeling, can calculate accurate kinematic parameters on the basis of real topographies (Dorren, 2003; Wang et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015; Li and Lan, 2015). However, interpreting the large number of unstable blocks as simulated disaster sources is extremely time consuming, and some unstable blocks do not pose threats to infrastructures. Some researchers determined the characteristics of rockfalls from historical information and triggering events to ascertain the associated risk along transportation networks. However, the investigated areas are mostly located in human settlements, which are inapplicable for uninhabited areas, where the history of rockfall is difficult to count (Guzzetti et al., 2003; Guzzetti et al., 2004). Therefore, determining critical unstable blocks, which threaten the tunnel portal, and conducting rockfall simulations are crucial to provide a statistical rockfall risk analysis.\nThe Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway's features, which include extremely high and steep rock slopes, make the characterization of rock slopes with potential rockfall hazards and the rockfall analysis more difficult than usual. Therefore, we employ the UAV nap-of-the-object photogrammetry technique with the characteristic of close flight distance to reconstruct a 3D geological model by acquiring high-resolution images of high and steep slopes. This method is clear and qualified for collecting information of discontinuities and interpreting unstable blocks. Then, we propose a methodology to perform well-directed rockfall simulations and a risk analysis by using 3D modeling and simulation software Rapid Mass Movement Simulation (RAMMS)::Rockfall (Glover et al., 2012). This methodology significantly narrows down the survey area by determining the potential-risk region and further utilizes designed simulations to guide us in locating critical disaster source areas and interpreting unstable blocks for well-directed simulations. It drastically reduces the effort to identify unstable blocks while providing a rockfall hazard risk analysis on the tunnel portal with few simulations.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\n\n2.1\nRegional engineering geological settings\nThis railway connects the Chengdu City, Sichuan Province and the Lhasa City, Tibet Autonomous Region (Fig. 1\n). The Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway, with a total length of 1800\u00a0km, was initiated in 2014. However, it has not been completed until today. As one of the important railway projects of China, it will greatly promote economic development, tourism development, and the infrastructure construction of the areas along the railway (Wei et al., 2018).\nThe study area is characterized by high altitudes and large elevation differences. The regional average elevation is >4000\u00a0m, with the lowest point located in Chengdu City with an elevation of 512\u00a0m and the highest point located in the peak of Mira Mountain with an elevation of 5018\u00a0m. A wide variety of landforms, such as mountains, rivers, and valleys, is developed in this area. Mountain ranges, such as Nyainqntanglha, Hengduan, and Himalayas, are characterized by highness and steepness features, with mountain summits reaching elevations >4000\u00a0m. The rivers are widely distributed throughout this area, such as the Nu, Jinsha, Lancang, Yarlung\u2013Zangbo, Yigongzangbu, Dadu, and Ya-lung Rivers. Numerous valleys are developed with an average elevation difference of over 3000\u00a0m from the water surfaces to their respective summits (Zhao et al., 2021).\nThe collision between the India Plate and the Eurasia Plate induces active neotectonic movements and the intermittent uplift of Tibetan Plateau. Adjustments to the movement within the Tibetan Plateau have resulted in deep, active, and concentrated faults (Hu et al., 2019). (Fig. 2\n). The railway runs through a number of well-developed faults, such as the Lancang River, Salween, Jiali, and Deqin Faults. These active faults severely endanger the security of bridges and tunnels along this railway. As a result of active tectonic movements, high-intensity earthquakes have occurred frequently. According to statistics, 150 earthquakes with Ms.\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0 occurred in this area from 1950 to 2013 (Xue et al., 2020). Many geological hazards resulting from earthquakes, such as rockfalls and rockslides, constitute major threats to the construction and working of this railway.\nThe geological map demonstrates that lithologies of the study area are characterized by sedimentary, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks from the Quaternary to the Sinien. Sedimentary rocks are dominated by Mesozoic conglomerate, sand mudstone, sand shale, and tuff. Magmatic rocks are predominantly granite, amphibolite, and porphyry. Metamorphic rocks contain schist, slate, gneiss, and dacite, which have developed primarily in the Proterozoic Eonothem stratigraphy (Li et al., 2019).\nThe temperature in the study area changes with the season and altitude. The annual average temperature is between 7\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0\u00b0C, with a maximum temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C in July and a minimum temperature of \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C in January. The temperature decreases quickly as the altitude rises. In May, the temperature is measured at \u22128\u00a0\u00b0C at 5029\u00a0m and\u00a0\u2212\u00a022\u00a0\u00b0C at 5944\u00a0m on the Mount Everest Precipitation, which is the spatially and temporally variable in the study area (Xu et al., 2017). Spatially, the annual precipitation in the area is between 450 and 1200\u00a0mm, and it is characterized by a gradual decrease from northeast to southwest. In 2017, the annual rainfall at Chengdu Station in the northeast of this area was 966.9\u00a0mm and at Lhasa Station in the southwest of this area was 550.6\u00a0mm. Temporally, precipitation is concentrated between May and September with 90% of it occurring during this period (Wu et al., 2020).\n\n\n2.2\nGeological settings of a case study \u2013 Kangyuqu area\nThis study takes the Kangyuqu area in the Changdu\u2013Linzhi section of the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway as the study object. The Kangyuqu area is laid on the west of the Luolong County, Changdu City, Tibet Autonomous Region. The Kangyuqu area is named after the Kangyuqu River flowing through here, with extremely high and steep slopes on both sides of the river, and the bridge built in this area is known as the Kangyuqu Bridge. The Kangyuqu Bridge, with a length of almost 400\u00a0m, crosses the river and connects both banks with two tunnel portals (respectively, the Changdu end of the Kangyuqu Tunnel and the Linzhi end of the Chada Tunnel), which are set in the intermediate part of the slopes with an elevation of 3433\u00a0m (Fig. 3a).\nCharacterized by typical mountain\u2013canyon geomorphology, the left bank of the studied Kangyuqu area is lower than the right bank. The elevation of the left bank ranges from 3281\u00a0m to 4100\u00a0m in terms of distance from the river surface to the peak, whereas the range on the right bank is from 3281\u00a0m to 4600\u00a0m. The valley exhibits a \u201cV\u201d shape, where the Kangyuqu River flows in a direction of approximately 330\u00b0 northwest with a river level elevation of approximately 3281\u00a0m.\nTwo main types of lithology from the Mesozoic Cretaceous have developed in this area. Fig. 3b and c illustrate that the rock masses on the right bank of the valley, where the Kangyuqu tunnel portal is located, are mainly gray slate interspersed with homogeneous metasandstone and coal seam. By contrast, the lithology of the left bank of the valley, where the Chada tunnel portal is located, is predominantly granodiorite. Located along the tectonically active Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway, compressive fault sets trending northwest\u2013southeast are mainly developed near the Kangyuqu area. The large-scale and active fault zone is Basu, of which the closest fault is approximately 7\u00a0km from the Kangyuqu area. These active faults of the Basu fault zone are large in scale, with extension lengths of >100\u00a0km and widths from tens to hundreds of meters, intersecting at large angles with the tunnel alignment in the Kangyuqu area and controlling the distribution and development of adverse geology phenomena in the region.\nUnder the influence of extreme climatic conditions and complex geological structures, the high and steep slopes in this area are commonly characterized by poor rock integrity and extremely developed unstable rock masses, which pose significant threats of rockfalls to the tunnel portal.\nAccording to the site investigation, the right bank of the Kangyuqu area is 1200\u00a0m in height, with bedrocks developed in the upper and lower parts with heights of 750 and 268\u00a0m as well as slope angles of 35\u00b0 and 50\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 4a). Rockfalls occurring in the upper bedrock area formed the colluvial deposits with a width of 800\u00a0m, a height of 200\u00a0m, and a slope angle of 16\u00b0 between two parts of the bedrock areas (Fig. 4b). The rockfalls also result in the accumulation of numerous boulders on the deposit surface, with small sizes staying on the deposit's upper part and large boulders resting on the deposit's front edge (Fig. 4c). The tunnel portal will be located 300\u00a0m from the deposit edge, within the lower bedrock area. As a consequence of the considerable distance between the tunnel portal and the colluvial deposits, the falling rocks may not be able to approach the tunnel portal, and even if they do, they will be halted by the developed bedrock that functions as a barrier behind the tunnel portal.\nA field investigation reveals that the left bank of the Kangyuqu area is 500\u00a0m high (Fig. 4a), and the joints and fractures are greatly developed due to climatic and tectonic conditions in the bedrock area, which is 230\u00a0m in height with a slope angle of 55\u00b0, resulting in a large number of unstable blocks. These unstable blocks are detached from the bedrock and accumulated beneath it to form the colluvial deposits, which are 540\u00a0m in width, 350\u00a0m in height, with a slope of 26\u00b0 (Fig. 4d). The accumulated boulders of various sizes are on the deposit surface, most of which are gathered on the intermediate segment of deposits, where the left bank tunnel portal is designed to be built (Fig. 4e). Considering that the tunnel portal is planned right below the bedrock area and within the movement of rockfalls, it is more susceptible to the threat of rockfalls, and the left bank slope is chosen to perform the rockfall analysis.\n\n\n\n3\nMethodologies\n\n3.1\nUAV nap-of-the-object photogrammetry\n\n3.1.1\nIntroduction\nUAV is a remote-controlled aircraft equipped with a self-contained program control device. With the development of unmanned aerial systems and digital cameras, the UAV platform has become more accessible and easier to be operated, and the equipped digital camera can perform the photography process, allowing UAV with a camera to be employed to perform the field surveys of photogrammetry (Tuckey, 2022).\nConventional UAV photogrammetry methods comprise vertical and oblique types. UAV vertical photogrammetry employs an on-board camera photography vertically downward, and all shooting positions are in a horizontal plane, which covers the survey area. The resolution of images varies greatly because the task distance from the camera to the ground is inconsistent for each image (Fig. 5a); for example, the slope foot images that do not have higher resolutions than those obtained at positions with close distances from slope top. Therefore, vertical photogrammetry technique enables the generation of DEM and DSM (3D surface model) (Kr\u0161\u00e1k et al., 2016), and it is unsuitable for discontinuity extraction and unstable block interpretation due to the large variation in resolution (Roncella et al., 2005).\nOblique photogrammetry utilizes five on-board digital cameras to acquire images, with the middle camera shooting vertically downward and the four remaining cameras spread around to capture oblique images at a fixed angle (Fig. 5b) (Yang et al., 2022). A predefined route planning enables the UAV to maintain an approximately consistent task distance from the ground, resulting in images with slight variation in resolution. Compared with vertical photogrammetry, oblique type provides images in more directions with higher resolutions. However, the redundant images acquired by the five on-board camera system are more than the useful images, resulting in excessive inefficiency. The large size of the adopted UAV of oblique photogrammetry allows flight distance to be set to a large number to prevent crashing with obstructions. Therefore, the 3D model reconstructed from oblique photogrammetry is insufficient to identify small-sized discontinuities (Wang et al., 2022).\nThe 3D model rebuilt from vertical and oblique types with inadequate accuracy and quality is insufficient to identify small-sized discontinuities and acquire associated information. Nap-of-the-object photogrammetry was proposed in 2018 by Zhang Zuxun, Professor of Wuhan University, to take images of objects by using portable UAV with a close distance (Liang et al., 2020). Then, DJI implements UAV flight continuously to the slope orientation with a task distance between 5 and 100\u00a0m by adopting 3D flight route planning (DJI, 2020). Compared with vertical and oblique types, nap-of-the-object photogrammetry uses the slope surface of a small area as the photographic object, and the photography angle is set to be perpendicular to the slope. Finally, based on the short flight distance and variable camera angles, the image resolution is sufficiently high to represent the actual terrain more delicately and realistically due to the close flight distance (Fig. 5c).\nNap-of-the-object photogrammetry employs precise 3D route planning to allow UAV to photograph a limited area of slope with a close flight distance. The initial terrain information obtained using conventional photogrammetry methods is used to divide the complicated terrain into several terrain units. Then, along a parallel direction with a close distance, several spatial planes are created to cover these units. Some flight characteristics, such as the flight path, speed, and overlap, are predefined and included in the 3D route planning to direct UAV in acquiring high-resolution images of the survey area. Finally, based on these images, the SfM and multiple view stereo (MVS) techniques are used to reconstruct the survey area in 3D.\nThe procedural steps of the UAV nap-of-the-object photogrammetry employed in this work are depicted in Fig. 6\n. The new photogrammetry approach can be divided into four components: initial terrain information acquisition (step a), 3D flight rouge planning (step b), and automatic flight with image collection (step c) are the three steps of field work. The photogrammetric processing (step d) is the major focus of indoor work.\n\n\n3.1.2\nField works\nThe field activities of nap-of-the-object photogrammetry consist of three steps: initial terrain information acquisition, 3D flight route planning, and flight operation, including automatic flight and photography. To work in the plateau with harsh circumstances and obtain high-resolution and quality images, a portable UAV with great performance and a high-quality on-board camera are necessary.\nIn this study, we employ a quadcopter DJI M300 RTK with DJI Zenmuse P1 to perform photogrammetric surveys. DJI M300 RTK has the characteristics of being operated in the work environments with an altitude reaching 7000\u00a0m and a temperature ranging from \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C to 50\u00a0\u00b0C, which make it suitable for surveys in the study area. The camera DJI Zenmuse P1 produces 45-megapixel format (8192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05460) images. The sensor size of the camera is 35.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024\u00a0mm, and the smallest size of the image point is 4.4\u00a0\u03bcm (Riordan et al., 2021). The detailed specifications of UAV and the on-board camera are shown in Table 1\n.\nThe initial terrain information is obtained by conventional photogrammetry methods with a resolution that may not be high enough for the 3D flight route planning. The oblique photogrammetry method is appropriate to acquire low-resolution images with preset flight parameters, including the flight distance, speed, and overlap along the path and between two parallel paths. As a result, all images covering the survey area are acquired for the generation of a DEM, which is used to perform the 3D flight route planning.\nThe 3D flight planning can effectively direct UAV to photographing positions with specific planning parameters (Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2013). It is the most significant part of the field activities and has a great influence on the accuracy and quality of the following generation of georeferenced data, such as 3D point clouds, DEM, and orthophotos (Jimenez-Jimenez et al., 2021). Based on the initial terrain information, the survey area is divided into several terrain units based on their occurrences, and the coordinates of the triangle vertices contained within each terrain unit are subsequently used for spatial plane fitting, as illustrated in Fig. 7\n. Then, by setting a certain flight distance from the fitted spatial planes that is typically between 5 and 100\u00a0m, multiple flight planes are created. Finally, the 3D flight planning is designed as flight lines that are parallel to one another and located on the flight planes. The camera angle is automatically set to be perpendicular to the fitted planes. The flight and shooting speeds are crucial parameters for the influence on image quality and power consumption, which should be predefined cautiously to avoid motion blur and short flight (Di Franco and Buttazzo, 2016). The image overlap allows the photogrammetric processing of images to utilize the resulting redundancy to ensure the 3D point cloud generation from dense multi-image matching (Martinez-Martinez et al., 2017). By importing the flight planning into the UAV flight control system, UAV takes off and automatically performs the photographing process to collect images on the basis of the planning parameters.\nIn the flight operation, the survey is carried out with a flight planning implemented to cover the survey area with a task distance between 5 and 100\u00a0m, an appropriate flight speed, and an automatic triggering of images. The minimum overlap between image frames is suggested to set at 90% along the flight path and 70% between two parallel flight paths. As a result of field work, high-resolution images are collected and used in the subsequent 3D model reconstruction and georeferenced data generation in Section 3.1.3.\n\n\n3.1.3\nLab works\nAfter acquiring high-resolution images from field works, the SfM technique uses pseudo-random redundant images from multiple photographing positions and angles to recover the 3D model of an object (Vanneschi et al., 2019). Various kinds of software are proposed and have been developed in recent years for the 3D reconstruction combining with the SfM technique, such as ContextCapture, Pix4D, Agisoft, VisualSFM, and DJI Terra.\nIn this study, DJI Terra was applied to process images, and a general workflow containing some sections of data processing would be followed by DJI Terra. First, the images were uploaded into the software, and the associated photographing positions information was imported. Second, the scale-invariant feature algorithm was adopted to match the key features of images (Lowe, 2004), and sparse cloud point was generated by the SfM technique (Westoby et al., 2012). Third, the MVS algorithm was employed to densify the sparse point cloud (Wang et al., 2021), and Delaunay triangulation algorithm and texture mapping were used to reconstruct the 3D model on the basis of the dense point cloud generated before (Zhou and Xiao, 2017). Finally, some georeferenced data, such as DEM and DOM, could be created with same resolutions as the images.\n\n\n\n3.2\nWell-directed rockfall simulations considering critical disaster sources\n\n3.2.1\nRockfall simulation approaches\nCertain rockfall simulation and modeling approaches have been presented and developed in order to provide a statistical and realistic analysis for the rockfall problem.(Lan et al., 2007). In comparison to 2D simulation and modeling, 3D approaches, such as RocPro3D, RockyFor 3D, CRSP-3D (Colorado Rockfall Simulation Program), STONE, and RAMMS::Rockfall, have proven to be helpful tools for assessing rockfall hazards with the capability to offer a spatial distribution of rockfall trajectories (Agliardi and Crosta, 2003; Moon et al., 2014; Corona et al., 2017).\nRAMMS::Rockfall is a new module for estimating rigid body movements of falling rocks in the RAMMS program (Vick et al., 2019). It constructs a valid computational model for simulating rockfall trajectories in 3D terrain using a hard-contact, rigid-body technique. The hard-contact technique accounts for the influence of rock shape on rock-terrain interaction and allows for the representation of major motion modes, such as sliding, rolling, skipping, and jumping (Leine et al., 2014) (Fig. 8\n). It differs from previous rockfall simulation programs in that the interaction between the rock and the terrain is governed by the frictional interaction, rather than by simple rebound mechanics. Previous researches show that RAMMS::Rockfall is a good tool for numerical simulation and rockfall analysis (Wendeler et al., 2016).\nBefore the simulation, the following parameters must be prepared: (1) digital elevation data with a matched orthophoto of the study area in an appropriate resolution; (2) simulated rock characteristics, such as the locations of disaster sources and rock volumes; and (3) simulated terrain properties, such as terrain materials and forested areas.\nThe distribution of rockfall trajectories and the prediction of the run-out distance can be achieved by combining these parameters. It also allows for the calculation and observation of kinematic parameters, including velocity, kinetic energy, and jump height in the 3D trajectory model. To obtain precise information for a rockfall risk study, a statistical analysis of several trajectories that reach a specific location is provided. Profile views, which show the current parameters, may also be used to evaluate a single trajectory in depth.\n\n\n3.2.2\nProcedures to perform well-directed rockfall simulations\nUnstable blocks, as disaster sources of rockfall hazards, are widely distributed along the Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway, resulting in a large number of potential rockfalls. Identifying all of them and performing rockfall simulations are difficult and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a methodology, including a series of procedures to locate unstable blocks that threaten the tunnel portal and conduct well-directed rockfall simulations. It narrows down the source areas by determining the potential-risk region and reduces the workload of the unstable block identification by determining critical disaster source areas.\nThe procedures comprise four steps as shown in Fig. 9\n: (a) potential-risk region determination; (b) critical disaster source area determination; (c) well-directed rockfall simulation process; and (d) statistical analysis of rockfall risk on a tunnel portal.\n\n(a)\nPotential-risk region determination.\n\n\n\nThe field investigation indicates that the rockfall source region can be classified into risk-free and potential-risk regions on the basis of slope aspects that have significant impacts on rockfall propagation. According to the aspects of the slope where the infrastructure is located, the rockfalls occurring on the slopes with specified aspects will not pose threats, and these areas can be considered risk-free regions. However, we are more concerned about the potential-risk region, which contains critical disaster source areas that is determined in step (b).\n\n(b)\nCritical disaster source area determination.\n\n\n\nThe potential-risk region determined in step (a) still has a large number of unstable blocks that must be identified. Therefore, critical disaster source areas containing unstable blocks that threaten the tunnel portal should be identified. Designed rockfall simulations are performed to locate the critical disaster source areas in the potential-risk region.\nDesigned rockfall simulations are conducted to investigate rockfall trajectory distributions, and the simulation processes are described as followed: First, DEM data with appropriate resolutions are selected to represent the 3D terrain. Second, the entire potential -risk region is divided into several areas with specific dimensions, and the center point of each area is selected as the release point. Then, terrain materials and forested areas as terrain properties can be defined by drawing or importing polygon shapefiles with various terrain and forested types according to the information collected from the field investigation and terrain property specifications. Finally, the simulations are performed by launching a hundred rocks for one release point with the same volume parameter, and the trajectories of each rock are calculated and observed on the 3D rockfall model.\nAfter acquiring the trajectory distribution of each point, a new variable\u2014reach probability\u2014is subsequently calculated as the proportion that the total number of rocks reaching the tunnel portal accounts for the full number of simulated rocks. If the probability value of a release point is greater than a critical value, then it means the risk to the tunnel portal from the rockfall developed in the area indicated by a center point is large, which can be regarded as a rockfall critical disaster source area.\nThe unstable blocks developed in critical disaster source areas pose significant threats to the tunnel portal, and they must be identified and interpreted for subsequent simulations. The detailed method to determine volume of potential rockfall and the persistence of the discontinuities will be discussed in Section 4.2. The associated characteristics of rockfall from critical disaster source areas are used in step (c) for well-directed simulations.\n\n(c)\nWell-directed rockfall simulation process.\n\n\n\nIn step (b), the reach probabilities of each release point representing a small area are utilized to determine the critical disaster source areas. The release probability is also necessary for risk analysis. The release probability is also necessary for risk analysis. The probability of release for unstable block is not considered because the mean frequency of the occurrence of rockfall events cannot be obtained from historical catalogues in such an uninhabited area (Hantz et al., 2021). In view of the influence of rockfall on tunnel portal in this study, the final result tends to show an important impact on the tunnel portal without considering the release probability, which is more suitable for providing protection suggestion of major railways.\nThis step follows a well-directed rockfall simulation process on the basis of the identified unstable blocks to investigate kinematic parameters, and the simulation process is the same as the method in step (b). Finally, fully considering the simulated parameters, kinematic parameters, including velocity, kinetic energy, and jump height, are calculated and can be seen for rock trajectories, which provide the capability to perform a statistical kinematic analysis.\n\n(d)\nRockfall disaster analysis on the tunnel portal.\n\n\n\nThe statistical analysis is performed after all of the results each unstable block have been collected, including trajectory distributions and kinematic parameters. By understanding the positions of the tunnel portal on the model, the trajectories that reach or halt at the tunnel portal are collected.\nThe statistical function of the simulation program aids us in the subsequent kinematic analysis. As a consequence, the rocks hitting the tunnel portal will have a kinetic energy range, a velocity range, and a maximum jump height, which can be used to provide recommendations for railway and tunnel portal construction.\n\n\n\n\n4\nGeneration of 3D slope model and feasibility of unstable block detection\n\n4.1\n3D slope model generation by nap-of-the-object photogrammetry\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, the left bank slope of the Kangyuqu area was selected as the survey area, and its initial terrain information was then obtained by an oblique photogrammetry survey, as stated in Section 3.1.2 with a flight distance of 200\u00a0m, speed of 2\u00a0m\/s, and an overlap along the path and between two parallel paths of 75% and 65%, respectively. As a result, a total of 700 images were acquired for the generation of initial terrain data, including DEM and orthophotos, which were subsequently used to perform the 3D flight planning.\nThe 3D flight planning was created using the initial terrain information that had been collected previously. In this study, the detailed flight planning implemented to cover the left bank slope of the Kangyuqu area was determined with a distance between UAV and a slope of 50\u00a0m, a flight speed of 6\u00a0m\/s, and an automatic triggering of images every 2\u00a0s (Fig. 10\n). The minimum overlap between image frames along the flight path was 90%, and the minimum overlap between two parallel flight paths was 70%.\nThe automatic flight operation and image collection were performed after importing the whole 3D flight planning into the flight control system of DJI M300 RTK, which was employed for the nap-of-the-object photogrammetric survey. As a result, a total of 2500 images with a resolution range of 0.005\u20130.046\u00a0m were collected and used for subsequent 3D model reconstruction and georeferenced data generation.\nThe photogrammetric processing software DJI Terra was used in this study, and 2500 images previously captured were imported with interior orientations and photographing position parameters, as describe in Section 3.1.3. Finally, a 3D geological model of the left bank slope was reconstructed with a same resolution range as the above images. Various DEM with different resolutions were created for the terrain modeling in the rockfall simulation.\n\n\n4.2\nUnstable block analyses\n\n4.2.1\nDiscontinuity analysis\nWith characteristics of high accuracy and quality, the discontinuities developed in rock masses can be easily identified in the established 3D model. We adopted the way of manual interpretation to perform the discontinuity analysis. Discontinuity is exposed as planes and linear traces can be clearly observed on high-resolution model, and no evident orientation change occurs, conforming to the characteristics of discontinuity. The coordinates of each selected point on the discontinuity can be acquired. The fractures were determined from the model by manually extracting three of more points and fitting spatial planes to individual discontinuities. The discontinuity persistence is basically the spatial extent of the fitted planes. For planar discontinuity, the persistence can be calculated as the distance between the two most distant points of the fracture within the exposed range. For linear discontinuity, the persistence is the distance between two end points. Discontinuity orientations, including dip directions and dip angles, are obtained based on a series of mathematical calculation steps of the normal vectors of the fitted planes (Sturzenegger and Stead, 2009).\nIn this section, we identified and interpreted 2434 discontinuities developed on the left bank slope with a dip direction of 60\u00b0. The analysis shows the five dominant groups of discontinuities of the left bank slope with homogeneity, including J1 (307\u00b0\/82\u00b0), J2 (30\u00b0\/77\u00b0), J3 (153\u00b0\/12\u00b0), J4 (123\u00b0\/57\u00b0), and J5 (89\u00b0\/82\u00b0). J1, J3, and J4 are sets of relevant discontinuities, together with random fractures form unstable blocks. Fig. 11\n shows the identification of discontinuities in a small area above the tunnel portal.\nGiven the high resolution of the 3D model, we used automatic discontinuity extraction based on the calculation of normal vector of point clouds to represent a comparison between automatic measurement and manual measurement. An example is given in Fig. 12\n, the result shows that large-scale discontinuities exposed as planes are well identified and delineated with calculation of dip directions and dip angles. However, they are unsuitable for discontinuities exposed as linear traces, which are an important part of unstable blocks. They can easily identify linear fractures in 3D model and point cloud, but the automatic extraction technique overlooked them. This finding can be explained by the application of the plane-based algorithm, and non-plane features were untreated. In addition, small-scale discontinuities were often neglected in automatic extraction in fractured rock mass area, especially structurally complex areas (Kong et al., 2021). Therefore, we used expert-based extraction in this research to perform discontinuity and unstable block analysis.\n\n\n4.2.2\nUnstable blocks analysis\nIn Section 3.2.2, we discussed how to locate areas containing unstable blocks as critical disaster sources for targeted rockfall simulations. This section discusses the feasibility of geometric and mechanical analyses of unstable blocks by using block theory and a 3D geological model.\nThe unstable blocks failure modes are mainly toppling and sliding types. As shown in Fig. 13\n, type A belongs to the toppling unstable blocks, which are developed in steep slope. Under the cutting action of multiple groups of fractures, blocks are formed on the slope surface. Once the control fracture of the trailing edge is penetrated, it produces a toppling failure. Type B belongs to the sliding unstable blocks, which lose bottom support. The influence of gravity or rainwater reduces the rock mass strength. When the sliding force exceeds the anti-sliding force, once the control fracture is penetrated, it produces a sliding failure.\nThe stability analyses are on the basis of discontinuity acquisition and understanding of failure mode. Block theory was proposed by R. E. Goodman and G. H. Shi in 1981 (Shi and Goodman, 1981); they assumed rock mass as a rigid body and that the damage comes from self-weight or external load, rather than from block strength. By using the geometric parameters of structural planes and free faces, which can be acquired from the 3D model, and by combining finiteness and removability theorem, block theory can directly determine the sliding surface and calculate the associated safety factor. Flexural toppling failure analysis can be performed by acquiring relative orientations of the discontinuity sets, which form the unstable blocks (Liu et al., 2010). Rock wedge failure mechanical analysis enables the evaluation of probability of kinematic instability to provide failure probability for construction based on (Park and West, 2001).\nIn this section, we also calculated the volume of unstable block from point clouds based on the identified collections of the discontinuities. Initially, we extracted the point cloud data of the outcrop surface of the unstable block and assumed that the fractures in the other orientations are persistent. Then, we generated the point cloud data of assumed persistent fractures to obtain the whole point cloud data (a polyhedron) of the unstable block containing all relevant discontinuities. Finally, we used the Alphashape function, which is built in Matlab, to fill the whole point cloud of unstable block, and the volume function was utilized to estimate the block volume (Long et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n5\nWell-directed rockfall simulation of a case study \u2013 Kangyuqu area\n\n5.1\nRockfall simulation process\nTo evaluate the influence of DEM resolution on rockfall simulations, we created DEM with resolutions of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1\u00a0m from 3D point clouds. Five rockfall simulations were performed using different DEM resolution and controlling for other parameters to be same. Trajectories and kinematic parameter (velocity) were calculated as shown in Fig. 14\n. The results were slightly different among the DEM of various resolutions, which can be explained by terrain roughness. Small terrain features, such as single rocks and small terraces, greatly affect the rockfall trajectories in the range of 0.1\u00a0m to 0.5\u00a0m, especially in a rough test site (B\u00fchler et al., 2016). It is worth mentioning that rockfall simulations using DEM with resolutions of 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25\u00a0m took <15\u00a0min to calculate, whereas simulations using 0.1\u00a0m DEM took more than three hours. After fully consideration, we found that the DEM with a resolution of 0.25\u00a0m was the best fit for the simulations in this work.\nGiven that the left bank slope of the Kangyuqu area has characteristics of highness, steepness, and inaccessibility, obtaining point clouds of rocks by using laser scanning is impractical. As a result, we decided to take a flat shape for the simulated rocks, as suggested in the manual. The associated rock volumes were acquired by interpreting unstable blocks in the critical disaster source areas in Section 5.2.\nThe ground parameters are closely related to the terrain material and can be assigned by appropriate selection of predefined terrain material models in RAMMS. The field investigation indicated that the upper and lower portions of the study slope are exposed bedrock outcrops, and the ground is very hard, which is deformed by rocks. The intermediate part is colluvial deposit, and the penetration depths of boulders are small. Considering the terrain type specification given by the software (Table 2\n), we created some shapefile with specific terrain types, including extra hard, medium hard, and river types, and then loaded them into the software to assign and restore ground parameters (Fig. 15\n). No vegetation growth was observed on this slope. Thus, vegetation parameters were not considered in this study.\n\n\n5.2\nCritical disaster source area determination of Kangyuqu\nThe colluvial deposit, where the tunnel portal is located on, and the bedrock area above share a common northeast-facing slope aspect according to the field investigation. (Fig. 16\n). Slopes with other slope aspects, such as southeast, are not critical disaster source areas because the rockfalls that occur there simply cannot reach the tunnel portal under the influence of slope aspects. Therefore, slopes with other slope aspects are regarded as the risk-free region, while the other slopes can be considered the potential-risk region.\nThe designed simulations were used to confirm actual rockfall risks in the potential-risk region and to determine unknown areas with high risks, as described in Section 3.2.2. We selected 40 small areas with a dimension of 10\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0m and employed their center points as release points, as displayed in Fig. 17a. We also ran simulations with 100 launched rocks for each point. The rockfall spatial distributions were acquired, and reach probabilities were estimated in Table 3\n (the coordinates were georeferenced in the WGS 84 reference system). Finally, we found that four points had higher reach probabilities than the other points, with values >8%.\nIn other areas with reach probabilities <8%, unstable blocks with large volumes that could threaten the tunnel portal were not found, indicating that rockfall risk in these areas is scarce. The boulders that have accumulated on the slope surface may start again into the process of movement, posing a threat to the tunnel portal. However, the field investigation revealed that the majority of boulders are embedded in the slope. The slope angle is also small enough, suggesting that the boulders are difficult to restart to move. Therefore, these accumulated boulders are not in the scope of our analysis.\nWe concluded that rockfalls from these four points with reach probabilities >8% and their adjacent areas, which are dubbed as critical disaster source areas, pose significant threats to the tunnel portal. Then, inside critical disaster source areas (Fig. 17b), a total of 10 unstable blocks ranging from Rock1 to Rock10 were discovered, and their information was obtained, as given in Table 4\n.\n\n\n5.3\n3D simulation results\n\n5.3.1\nSimulation results from each unstable block\nThe positions of the unstable blocks discovered in critical disaster source areas are employed as release points in the simulations, and the volumes of unstable blocks are used to simulate the rock volumes. 100 rocks are launched for simulations at each release point, and 1000 rocks are released from critical disaster source areas.\nRock10 is taken as an example to study the rockfall behavior, including the propagation areas and the locations of stopping points. The modeling findings reveal that most trajectories are focused on the colluvial deposit and oriented northeast, which matches most of the rocks observed in the field, as shown in the 3D trajectory model (Fig. 18\n). After initiation, all the rocks move down the slope, and the majority of them reach the valley region, where they fall into the river or the other side of the valley, thereby ending the movement. However, some boulders are still lying on the deposit surface.\nThe estimated kinematic parameters are the most important findings for the rockfall hazard analysis, as evidenced by the rockfall model's rock trajectories. Table 5\n shows the maximum values of velocity, kinetic energy, jump height, impact force, and their related reach probabilities for whole trajectories of each unstable block simulation. The highest velocity is 57.88\u00a0m\/s, and the maximum kinetic energy is 76,671.60\u00a0kJ, according to the data obtained when the unstable blocks have the largest volumes. The jump height is larger as the rock approaches the deposit edge, with a maximum value of 48\u00a0m. The maximum rockfall reach probabilities for Rock7, Rock9, and Rock10 are 10%, 10%, and 14%, respectively, as determined by trajectory profiles.\n\n\n5.3.2\nRockfall hazard analysis on the tunnel portal\nThree trajectory profiles with kinematic parameter views from Rock10 are shown in Fig. 19\n. The profile analysis provides an in-depth examination of individual parameters and the rockfall risk reaching the tunnel portal. Due to the contact times, the rockfall's velocity and kinetic energy are higher in the steep section of the slope and lower in the intermediate part of the slope. As only few interactions are observed between rocks and terrains in steep places, free flying accounts for the majority of movements, resulting in high velocity and kinetic energy in the air. The increased number of interactions in the intermediate area causes a sharp drop in velocity and kinetic energy, which keeps the values in the low range. The jump height is proportional to the reduction in slope angle, and it is minor while the rock moves on the gentle deposit surface, rising at the deposit's edge when the slope abruptly steepens, and reaching a maximum value of 20\u00a0m. The simulation profiles indicate that the impact is created with 26,000\u00a0kJ at 18\u00a0m\/s and accompanied by the 3\u00a0m jump height when the rocks reach the tunnel portal.\nTo examine the rockfall risk for the tunnel portal on the slope, 65 simulated trajectories, which reach the tunnel portal, are chosen for the statistical analysis from a total of 1000 simulations. Considering temporal frequency, all trajectories move in 74\u00a0s, and this temporal range can be roughly divided into three stages. In the first 13.5\u00a0s, the rockfalls move quickly from the source to the tunnel portal. Then, in the next 10\u00a0s (i.e., from 13.5\u00a0s to 23.5\u00a0s), the rockfalls reach and hit the tunnel portal. Finally, from 23.5\u00a0s to the end of the movement time, all rockfalls move freely on the deposit surface below the tunnel portal, and then remain on the surface or fall into the river while stopping. As illustrated in Fig. 20\n, the kinetic energy of rocks reaching the tunnel portal varies from 300\u00a0kJ to 20,000\u00a0kJ, with a velocity range of 8\u201330\u00a0m\/s and a maximum jump height of 25\u00a0m. These results suggest that the tunnel portal is subject by the rockfall risk from above, and they can be used to provide advice for railway constructions.\n\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nDiscontinuity identification and unstable block interpretation is a key feature of high and steep slope characterization. UAV photogrammetry technique is developed and implemented, due to the inaccessibility of unoccupied areas, to collect 2D images and reconstruct 3D geological model by using the SfM algorithm. In this study, nap-of-the-object photogrammetry was used for the first time to perform photogrammetric survey along Sichuan\u2013Tibet Railway and to analyze the rock mass structure of high and steep rock slopes.\nTo overcome the problem of low resolutions of image acquirement in the region with large terrain undulation resulting from large task distance from UAV to the slope surface, precise 3D flight route planning, including shooting positions and camera angles, with fitted spatial planes enables the automatic high-resolution image collection. The fitted spatial planes were set to rectangular planes parallel to the slope surface in the field activities. However, the actual slope terrain is not as smooth as the fitted rectangular plane, the existence of some fluctuation results in slight resolution difference between the images acquired in the same fitted spatial planes. Therefore, we deliberately increased the number and reduced the size of fitted spatial planes in areas with undulating terrain, such as bedrock outcrops and cliffs, to ensure that the acquired images have approximately consistent resolution.\nThe discontinuity sets identified and their associated orientations showed that the 3D geological model reconstructed by nap-of-the-object photogrammetry is suitable for fracture extraction and unstable block interpretation. We also performed a comparison between automatic extraction and expert based extraction given that the application of automatic (semi-automatic) discontinuity extraction is well established. The results showed that automatic extraction is practical, but due to the extremely broken rock structure in the study area, the interpretation algorithm based on normal vectors of 3D point clouds cannot identify the discontinuity effectively, resulting in inaccurate orientation. However, for the high resolution of the model with broken rock mass structure, the algorithm for automatic discontinuity extraction is a hot research topic in the future.\nThe 3D simulation of rockfall is always difficult because of the uncertainties associated with the rockfall process and ground parameters. Therefore, a series of calibration procedures of the trajectories should be performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. Previous literature suggested that the results should be compared with a detailed past rockfall hazard map to calibrate the model parameters and confirm the model accuracy (Maria Mateos et al., 2016). However, this procedure is unsuitable for our research. First, the unmanned area lacks historical rockfall information statistics. In addition, most boulders accumulated on the site are broken, so the positions of the boulders do not represent the end point of rockfall movements. Therefore, it is inappropriate for trajectory calibration. In the simulations, we selected the terrain material types, which are consistent with the field survey results, and reasonably interpreted the locations and volumes of unstable blocks, which also ensure the reliability of the results to some extent.\nThe fallen rocks are often fragmented while in contact with the ground according to the existing discontinuities. RAMMS::Rockfall is proven as a powerful and efficient tool to reproduce rockfall hazards; however, it does not contain modules for modeling rock fragmentation process. Therefore, simulating the rockfall and subsequent fragmentation process of large unstable block, as well as the influence of broken blocks on tunnel portal, is impossible. Therefore, a rockfall simulation program considering fragmentation process should be further developed in the future.\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nPerforming a statistical kinematic analysis of 3D rockfall simulation presents a major challenge due to the widely distributed unstable blocks, which are considered rockfall sources on high and steep slopes. In this study, we apply a new UAV photogrammetry technique, nap-of-the-object photogrammetry, for field surveys and unstable blocks interpretation for the first time. A new methodology for well-directed simulations considering rockfall critical disaster source areas is proposed to analyze the actual rockfall threats on the tunnel portal. The major findings are as follows.\n\n1.\nThe field surveys of high and steep slopes are difficult because of inaccessibility. UAV nap-of-object-photogrammetry is used to collect high-resolution images based on precise 3D flight route planning and fitted spatial planes. Combined with SfM algorithm, point cloud data are generated, and 3D geological model is reconstructed and applied for discontinuity extraction and unstable block interpretation.\n\n\n2.\nDiscontinuity and unstable block analysis is performed based on the proposed 3D model. The results show the five discontinuity sets relevant for the formation of unstable blocks. We compared automatic extraction and manual extraction to obtain more accurate discontinuity information, and the findings show that the expert-based extraction method is more suitable in this study. The calculation of unstable block sizes is presented to acquire potential rockfall volumes, which are a key factor in the improvement of 3D rockfall simulation.\n\n\n3.\nRockfall critical disaster source areas are considered to reduce the simulation workload. A series of procedures, including field investigation, high-resolution model, and reach probability of designed simulations, is proposed to determine the critical disaster source areas, which contain unstable blocks posing a substantial threat to the tunnel portal. Subsequent well-directed rockfall simulation is then performed under the guidance of the determination of actual dangerous unstable blocks. The case study of Kangyuqu area proves that this method is well suited for rockfall hazard analysis in areas with fractured rock mass structures and widely distributed unstable blocks.\n\n\n4.\nThis study demonstrated that the tunnel portal to be built on the left bank slope of Kangyuqu area is seriously threatened by the rockfalls above. Based on the rockfall trajectory distributions and kinematic parameters calculated, the rockfalls reaching the tunnel portal possess kinetic energy in the range of 300\u201320,000\u00a0kJ, with a velocity range of 8\u201330\u00a0m\/s and a maximum jump height of 25\u00a0m.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nWen Zhang: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Project administration, Funding acquisition.

With the development of deep underground engineering, rockbursts have become a common engineering hazard in the process of deep tunnel excavation. In minor cases they affect the project progress and causes mechanical damage, while in serious cases they may threaten the safety of construction workers, induce regional earthquakes, and even destroy the entire project (Li et al., 2012a; Gong et al., 2012; Keneti and Sainsbury, 2018). Therefore, predicting the possibility and intensity of rockburst activity has become one of the key scientific problems that must urgently be solved in the construction of deep underground projects.\nSince the first research on rockburst theory was performed in 1920, researchers throughout the world have analyzed the mechanism of rockburst from different perspectives, and proposed a series of representative theories, such as strength theory (Hoek and Brown, 1980), energy theory (Wiebols and Cook, 1968), stiffness theory (Cook, 1965) and fracture damage theory (Ortlepp and Stacey, 1994). In the past several decades, experts and scholars both in China and overseas have taken the above-mentioned theory as the core, and carried out a series of indoor and on-site in-situ experiments. They have proposed a large number of indexes or standards to evaluate the possibility and intensity of rockburst activity in terms of rock mass strength, energy, brittleness, critical depth and integrity (Russenes, 1974; Singh, 1987; Zhou et al., 2012). These studies have shown that the occurrence of rockburst is closely related to rock physical and mechanical property, in-situ stress level, rock mass structure and distribution of fractures. However, due to the complexity of rock mass and the influence of environmental factors, rockburst prediction has become a complex and fuzzy system problem. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain accurate results for it using only a single theory or method. In view of the complexity and ambiguity of rockburst problems, many statistical and artificial intelligence methods have been introduced into the research of rockburst prediction, such as fuzzy mathematics, rough set theory, grey system and BP neural network (Liang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; He et al., 2015). Although these methods exhibit great reliability in practical application, their disadvantages are also apparent, such as high calculation cost, fewer rockburst control factors considered, and unexplainable primary and secondary relationships between control factors. In the multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, due to the fact that different control factors have different effects on rockburst tendency, assigning objective and accurate weights to each control factor has become a key problem in determining rockburst tendency. The existing methods of weight determination, such as analytic hierarchy process, Delphi method, entropy method and coefficient of variation method, also have some shortcomings. For example, subjective weighting methods such as the analytic hierarchy process are greatly affected by the subjective bias and preferences of experts, while the entropy and coefficient of variation methods are more sensitive to the differences between the indicators. Therefore, exploring a weighting method which is less affected by subjective errors and fully considers the variability and conflict between various indicators is essential for rockburst tendency assessment.\nFor the above reasons, this paper selects rock physical and mechanical property, in-situ stress and rock mass integrity as the main influencing factors of rockburst tendency. A new combination weighting method is proposed, after which the matter-element extension theory is introduced into the rockburst issue to predict the rockburst tendency. In the combination weighting method, the concept of fuzzy number is introduced into the analytic hierarchy process, so as to greatly reduce the influence of subjective error on the weighting result. Then, the CRITIC weighting method is used to calculate the objective weight of each rockburst control factor, thereby overcoming the problem that the traditional objective weighting method is relatively sensitive to the index difference. Next, the comprehensive weight of the combination weighting method is obtained based on the principle of minimum discriminative information. Then the matter-element extension theory is introduced to establish the correlation degree between the rockburst samples to be evaluated and each rockburst grade, after which a comprehensive evaluation model of rockburst intensity is constructed. The model is applied to the Bayu Tunnel project of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway in China to predict the rockburst tendency. It is shown that the prediction results of the model are consistent with the actual situation. Finally, the applicability and superiority of the model are verified by the rockburst case data recorded in the existing literature.\n\n\n2\nOverview of the project\n\n2.1\nEngineering geological conditions and excavation support of the Bayu Tunnel\nThe Bayu Tunnel of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is located in the lower reaches of Sangri to Jiacha in the southern Tibet valley. The geological profile of the tunnel is shown in Fig. 1a. The altitude of the tunnel area is ranges from 3260 to 5500\u00a0m, and the elevation difference reaches 2300\u00a0m. The tunnel system consists of one main tunnel and two auxiliary parallel pilot tunnels. The total length of the tunnel is 13,047\u00a0m, the length of the entrance parallel pilot tunnel is 4058\u00a0m, and the exit one is 4073\u00a0m. The cross-sections of the main tunnel and parallel pilot tunnel are both in the shape of a city gate, with respective dimensions of 8.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.7\u00a0m and 6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07.2\u00a0m (Fig. 1b). The maximum buried depth of the tunnel is approximately 2080\u00a0m, and the maximum principal stress tested is 55\u00a0MPa. The principal stress intersects with the tunnel axis at a small angle, and the maximum surrounding rock temperature is 49\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe overburden layer within the tunnel area is mainly composed of colluvium gravelly soil from the upper Quaternary Holocene (Q4\ndl+col) and upper Quaternary Pleistocene moraine layer (Q3\ngl). The underlying bedrock mainly consists of medium-grained biotite granite from the Tertiary Eocene (E2R). There are minute quantity pegmatite veins present in some sections of the tunnel area, and the tectonic is slightly developed. The tunnel crosses the Zangmu fault nearly vertically at chainage DK200\u00a0+\u00a0006. The Zangmu fault is a normal fault, the fault is about 2.1\u00a0km in length, and the width of the fracture zone is 10 to 20\u00a0m. As the area is affected by regional structure and epigenetic surface reformation, structural fissures and unloading weathering fissures are developed, the structural fissure combination often exhibits an X-shaped distribution (Fig. 1c). The tunnel is excavated by full section borehole blasting, and the main supporting method is thin-layer sprayed concrete, with an anchor rod. For poor geological conditions or rockburst occurrence areas, bolts, steel mesh or steel arch support are appropriately added.\n\n\n2.2\nRockburst characteristics of the Bayu Tunnel\nThe Bayu Tunnel is the most problematic tunnel project in the Lhasa-Nyingchi section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. Tectonically, the tunnel is located at the intersection of the Eurasian plate and Indian plate, thus the regional tectonic activity there is strong, the geological conditions are complex, and the in-situ stress is high. During tunnel construction, high-intensity rockbursts frequently occur (Fig. 2\n), and the rockburst section accounts for 94% of the tunnel. Rockbursts have caused serious damage to the equipment and support system, and have led to unbalanced construction process, frequent replacement of construction workers due to anxiety, increased construction cost, and in general have seriously restricted the construction progress.\nThe rockburst grades of the Bayu Tunnel are divided into minor rockburst, moderate rockburst and strong rockburst. The field statistics show that the rockbursts in the Bayu Tunnel are dominated by minor and moderate rockburst, with a low frequency of strong rockburst. The occurrence frequency of rockburst hazards in the JPDK194\u00a0+\u00a0450\u00a0~\u00a0JPDK195\u00a0+\u00a0620 section of the parallel pilot tunnel and JZDK195\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0~\u00a0JZDK197\u00a0+\u00a0400 section of the main tunnel is relatively high (Fig. 3\n). A total of 43 rockbursts have occurred in the monitoring area of the parallel pilot tunnel, of which 36 were minor rockbursts, accounting for 83.72%; six were moderate rockbursts, accounting for 13.95%; and two were strong rockbursts, accounting for 2.33%. A total of 151 rockbursts occurred in the monitoring area of the main tunnel, among which 110 were minor rockbursts, accounting for 72.85%; 36 were moderate rockbursts, accounting for 23.84%; and five were strong rockbursts, accounting for 3.31%. Next, two typical rockburst cases which occurred during the excavation process are selected to describe the rockburst characteristics of the Bayu Tunnel.\n\n2.2.1\n\u201cOctober 16\u201d moderate rockburst\nOn October 16, 2018, a moderate rockburst occurred in the tunnel section with mileage of DK195\u00a0+\u00a0615\u00a0~\u00a0DK195\u00a0+\u00a0630. Many rock blocks were ejected from the surrounding rock, mostly prismatic or tabular in shape, with thickness of 10\u201320\u00a0cm. The rocks ejected by this moderate rockburst were relatively large (the largest rock block measured 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0m), the maximum ejection distances reached about 5\u00a0m, and the fracture surfaces were arc- and wedge-shaped cavities. The occurrence of rockburst was accompanied by dull thunder and much powdery debris. Finally, a shallow nest shaped pit with a depth of about 0.8\u00a0m was formed at the left spandrel near the working face (Fig. 4\n). The moderate rockburst occurred intermittently, and continued until 17:00 on October 17.\n\n\n2.2.2\n\u201cApril 18\u201d strong rockburst\nAt approximately 22:00 on April 18, 2018, a strong rockburst occurred in the section from JPD1K195\u00a0+\u00a0422 to JPD1K195\u00a0+\u00a0425 of the entrance parallel pilot tunnel. A clear and crisp cracking sound resembling a detonator blasting could be heard in the field, and the spalling and loosening of the rocks were serious. The morphological characteristics of the rockburst blocks were prismatic, lenticular or scaly, and the fracture characteristics were fresh shell-shaped, with a thickness of 5\u201330\u00a0cm, and the largest rock block size was 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.8\u00a0m. There were two groups of joints developed in the surrounding rock on the left side of the tunnel face, and both joint groups were slightly tensioned without filling. One group of joints had a dip angle of 50\u00b0, dip direction of 165\u00b0, and a spacing of approximately 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m. Another group of joints had a dip angle of 35\u00b0, dip direction of 210\u00b0, and a spacing of approximately 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m. The joints in the tunnel face were relatively developed, with three groups of joints. One group had a dip angle of 30\u00b0, dip direction of 35\u00b0. The joints were slightly tensioned without filling, with a spacing of about 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m, extending from the tunnel face to the surrounding rock. Another group of joints had a dip angle of 15\u00b0, dip direction of 50\u00b0, and a spacing of approximately 0.1\u20130.3\u00a0m. The joints were closed, distributed in the middle of the tunnel face. The final group of joints had a dip angle of 50\u00b0, dip direction 165\u00b0, and a spacing of approximately 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0m. The joints were slightly tensioned, and distributed at the junction of the top arch on the left side of the tunnel face and the surrounding rock. It was in this final group of joints that the rockburst occurred. Finally, a concave crater with a longitudinal length of approximately 3\u00a0m, circumferential length of approximately 2\u00a0m and maximum depth of 1\u00a0m was formed at the left spandrel near the working face (Fig. 5\n). The \u201cApril 18\u201d strong rockburst caused a 10-day delay in the construction period.\n\n\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nDetermination of rockburst tendency evaluation indexes\nThere are many influencing factors that induce rockburst hazards, which depend on the physical and mechanical properties of the rock, and are also affected by the magnitude of the in-situ stress and integrity of the rock mass (Christopher and Mark, 2016). Relevant literature from around the world typically selects four rockburst evaluation indexes to construct the rockburst tendency evaluation index system: rock brittleness coefficient\u03c3\n\nc\n\/\u03c3\n\nt\n, rock stress coefficient\u03c3\n\n\u03b8\n\/\u03c3\n\nc\n, elastic energy coefficientW\n\net\nand rock integrity coefficientK\n\n\u03bd\n. Considering that the rock brittleness coefficient and elastic energy coefficient are both indexes by which to characterize the physical and mechanical properties of rock, non-independent phenomena will be present between the indexes. Therefore, this chapter will discuss in detail the selection of the three key rockburst influencing factors: rock physical and mechanical property, rock stress and rock mass integrity.\n\n3.1.1\nControl effect of rock physical and mechanical property on rockburst\nThe physical and mechanical properties of rock can be characterized by the strength, stiffness and brittleness of rock, which reflect the ability of rock mass to store elastic deformation energy under high in-situ stress state. Rock is an aggregate of many different types of mineral particles. The mechanical properties of rock are the macroscopic mechanical manifestations of its internal mineral types, mechanical properties of mineral particles, size and shape, connection structure between particles, mineral content, and grain cleavage degree. The mechanical properties of rock are the macroscopic mechanics of its mineral type, mechanical properties, size and shape, connection structure, mineral content and degree of the crystals' cleavage. Considering that the brittleness of rock can be regarded as the characterization of various physical and mechanical properties, such as rock minerals, mechanical properties, porosity, fracture, mineral grain size and spatial distribution. Therefore, rock brittleness can be used to quantify the controlling effect of rock physical and mechanical property on rockburst. Kuang et al. (2021) held that the ability of rock to resist brittle failure can be characterized by brittle mineral content, grain size and degree of homogeneity at the microscopic level, and proposed a brittleness evaluation index BICSS (Eq. (1)) based on the complete stress-strain curve of rock, which revealed the internal relationship among rock brittleness and brittle mineral content, grain size, occlusion structure between mineral particles, and rock weathering degree. Therefore, when constructing a rockburst tendency index system of deep buried tunnels, the brittleness index BICSS is introduced into the system as the rock physical and mechanical property control factor, which can comprehensively describe the control effect of the differences in the physical and mechanical properties of the rock on the tendency of rockburst. The classification standard is shown in Table 1\n.\n\n(1)\n\n\nF\nP\n\n=\nBICSS\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u03c3\np\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\nci\n\n\n\n10\n\u00d7\n\n\u03b5\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\np\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\nci\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n\n\n\u03c3\np\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\nr\n\n\n\n10\n\u00d7\n\n\u03b5\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\np\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b5\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere F\n\nP\n is the rock physical and mechanical properties factor, and \u03c3\n\nci\n\n, \u03c3\n\np\n\n, \u03c3\n\nr\n\n, \u03b5\n\nci\n\n, \u03b5\n\np\n and \u03b5\n\nr\n are the crack initiation stress, peak stress, residual stress and strain values of corresponding characteristic stress points during rock laboratory test, respectively.\n\n\n3.1.2\nControl effect of the surrounding rock stress on rockburst\nIn-situ stress is the fundamental cause of deformation and failure in various underground geotechnical engineering excavation, and high in-situ stress is the necessary condition for rockburst (Zhao et al., 2016). From the perspective of the characterization of the original rock stress and surrounding rock stress, the maximum principal stress and vertical stress of the rock mass can only one-sidedly reflect the initial stress state of the rock without being disturbed. At the same time, the maximum tangential stress of the surrounding rock is a function of the maximum principal stress of the rock mass, and can reflect the distribution of the secondary stress field of the surrounding rock after excavation. A rockburst is an engineering hazard phenomenon which occurs during the redistribution of the stress of the rock mass near the empty surface due to the excavation, thus the maximum tangential stress can characterize the distribution of the surrounding rock stress well. Therefore, in the process of studying the effect of stress on rockburst control, the maximum tangential stress of the surrounding rock can more effectively reflect the true rock stress state after excavation disturbance than the magnitude of the principal stress in the local coordinate system. In conclusion, it is feasible to discuss the control effect of in-situ stress and secondary stress field on rockburst tendency by using the ratio of maximum tangential stress of surrounding rock to the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock. The evaluation index and classification standard is shown in Eq. (2) and Table 2\n.\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\nS\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\n\u03b8\n\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere F\n\nS\n is the stress control factor, and \u03c3\n\n\u03b8\n and \u03c3\n\nc\n are the maximum tangential stress of the surrounding rock and uniaxial compressive strength of the rock, respectively.\n\n\n3.1.3\nControl effect of rock mass integrity on rockburst\nGeological weak planes such as joints, fissures and bedding exist widely in underground rock mass. The presence of these geological weak planes reduces the integrity of rock mass, and has a great impact on the mechanical properties of rock mass (Li et al., 2012b). It is necessary to fully consider the influence of rock mass integrity on the mechanical behavior of surrounding rock following excavation. The integrity of the rock mass and degree of development of joints and fissures can be reflected by means of acoustic testing. The faster the sound wave propagates in the rock mass are, the higher the integrity of the rock mass and the weaker the degree of weathering will be. At present, the most widely used and representative index used to reflect the integrity of rock mass is the rock mass integrity coefficient K\n\nv\n (Zhou et al., 2012). This method reflects the integrity of rock mass by using the ratio of elastic longitudinal wave velocity of rock mass to elastic longitudinal wave velocity of rock. Its evaluation index and classification standard is shown in Eq. (3) and Table 3\n.\n\n(3)\n\n\nF\nI\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nV\nml\n\n\/\n\nV\ncl\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere F\n\nI\n is the rock mass integrity factor, and V\n\nml\n and V\n\ncl\n are the elastic longitudinal wave velocity of the rock mass and elastic longitudinal wave velocity of the rock, respectively.\n\n\n\n3.2\nWeight calibration of evaluation indexes\nIn the rockburst tendency prediction problem, the control factors are mutually restrictive and interrelated. In addition, for different construction environments, the control effect of each influencing factor on the rockburst tendency will also change. Therefore, using a single weighting method to analyze the rockburst tendency is one-sided, and the judgment result will inevitably exhibit large deviation. To resolve this issue, this section combines the subjective weighting method, objective weighting method and principle of minimum discriminative information to solve the comprehensive weights of the evaluation indexes.\n\n3.2.1\nTriangular fuzzy number analytic hierarchy process (TFN-AHP)\nThe triangular fuzzy number analytic hierarchy process (TFN-AHP) is an improved algorithm which applies the triangular fuzzy number to the traditional analytic hierarchy process. It introduces the greatest possibility to increase the accuracy of the risk assessment result. The theoretical aspect is more rigorous than the interval valued fuzzy number analytic hierarchy process, and its calculation method is more convenient than the trapezoidal fuzzy number analytic hierarchy process (Chang, 1996).\nIn the establishment of rockburst tendency index system studied in this paper, the target layer is the weight of rockburst control factors, and the criterion layer is the three main rockburst control factors. The relative importance of rockburst control factors is evaluated by the 1\u20139 scale method proposed by Saaty and Kearns (1985). Different from the traditional analytic hierarchy process, the TFN-AHP method uses the triangular fuzzy numberp\n\nij\n\u00a0=\u00a0[l\n\nij\n,\nm\n\nij\n,\nu\n\nij\n]to reflect the importance of the rockburst control factors, and constructs the judgment matrix, in whichl\u00a0\u2264\u00a0m\u00a0\u2264\u00a0u, and parameters l, m and u are, respectively, the lower limit value, most possible risk value and upper limit value of the triangular fuzzy number.\nAfter the triangular fuzzy judgment matrix have been established, Eqs. (4) and (5) can then be used to calibrate the fuzzy synthesis degree of the criterion layer relative to the target layer S\n\nk\n and the possibility of different fuzzy comprehensive degrees S\n\ni\n\u00a0>\u00a0S\n\nj\n:\n\n(4)\n\n\nS\nk\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\np\nij\n\n\u2297\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\np\nij\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\nV\n\n\n\nS\ni\n\n>\n\nS\nj\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nm\ni\n\n>\n\nm\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nl\nj\n\n>\n\nu\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\nj\n\n\u2212\n\nu\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\ni\n\n\u2212\n\nu\ni\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nm\nj\n\n\u2212\n\nl\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\notherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n2\n\u22ef\nn\n\nj\n\u2260\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere S\n\nk\n is the fuzzy synthesis degree of the k-th criterion in the criterion layer, p\n\nij\nis known as the importance interval of the evaluation factor i to the factor j, and l, m and u are the lower limit value, most possible risk value and upper limit value of the triangular fuzzy number, respectively.\nThe possibility that the i-th fuzzy synthesis degree is greater than the other k fuzzy synthesis degrees is defined as the initial subjective weight of the i-th evaluation factor (Eq. (6)). Finally, the final weight value of each evaluation factor of the criterion layer can be obtained by normalizing the initial subjective weight (Eq.

Among them, the variability of the index is characterized by the standard deviation, which reflects the size of the difference in the value of the evaluation object under the same indicator. The greater the standard deviation is, the greater the difference between the evaluation objects will be, so that the greater the amount of information covered by the index is, the greater the weight will be. In addition, the conflict between indicators is characterized by the correlation coefficient. If the correlation coefficient between indicators is larger, this signifies a smaller the conflict between indicators, which in turn signifies that the amount of information contained in the two indicators is more repetitive, thus it is necessary to give a smaller weight. The specific steps of using the CRITIC weighting method to weight evaluation indicators are as follows:\nSuppose there are n evaluation indicators and m evaluation objects in the multi-attribute decision making problem.\nStep 1: Perform the forward or reverse processing of the decision matrix:\nFor benefit indexes (the larger, the better):\n\n(8)\n\n\nr\nij\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\nij\n\n\u2212\n\nx\nj\nmin\n\n\n\n\nx\nj\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nx\nj\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nm\n;\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor cost indexes (the smaller, the better):\n\n(9)\n\n\nr\nij\n\n=\n\n\n\nx\nj\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nx\nij\n\n\n\n\nx\nj\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nx\nj\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nm\n;\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate the correlation coefficient between two indexes\u03c1\n\njk\n:\n\n(10)\n\n\n\u03c1\njk\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\n\n\nr\nij\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\u00af\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\nik\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\u00af\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nr\nij\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\u00af\n\nj\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nr\nik\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\u00af\n\nk\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nj\n,\nk\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate the standard deviation of each index\u03c3:\nAmong them, the standard deviation of the j-th index\u03c3\n\nj\nis:\n\n(11)\n\n\n\u03c3\nj\n\n=\n\n\n\n1\nm\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nr\nij\n\n\u2212\n\n\nr\n\u00af\n\nj\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of information c covered by each index and the corresponding weightw:\n\n(12)\n\n\nc\nj\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nj\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1\njk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(13)\n\n\nw\nOi\n\n=\n\n\nc\ni\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\nc\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\n\n\n\u22ef\n,\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3\nDetermination of comprehensive weight (MDI)\nThe calculation of comprehensive weight not only requires that the results do not focus on any weighting method, but it also requires that objective facts are respected and a rigorous calculation process is implemented.

The advantages of this method are that it has rigorous theory and small amount of calculation, and can unify qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. The most important point is that its analysis process is not limited by the characteristics of the event itself, thus it can be effectively applied to multi-attribute decision making in comprehensive evaluation.\nThe matter element is an ordered collection of the description of things, with the event to be evaluated N, event control factor C and specific quantity value V of control factor, which can form matter element R (N, C, V). Next, the correlation degree of each evaluation level corresponding to the event to be evaluated is calculated according to the classical domain and joint domain defined by the matter element, then the level of the object to be evaluated is determined. The specific steps of the matter-element extension theory construction are as follows:\nStep 1: Determine the matter element to be evaluated R\n\nd\n, classical domain R\n\nj\n and joint domain R\n\np\n:\n\n(16)\n\n\nR\nd\n\n=\n\n\nN\nd\n\nC\nV\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nd\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nn\n\n\n\n\nV\ndn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere N\n\nd\n is the matter element to be evaluated, C\n\n1\n, C\n\n2\n, \u2026, C\n\nn\n are the characteristic indexes of the matter element to be evaluated, and V\n\nd1\n, V\n\nd2\n, \u2026, V\n\ndn\n are the actual values of the corresponding characteristic indexes.\n\n(17)\n\n\nR\nj\n\n=\n\n\nN\nj\n\nC\n\nV\nj\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nj\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nj\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nj\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nn\n\n\n\n\nV\njn\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nj\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\nj\n1\n\n\n\nb\n\nj\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\nj\n2\n\n\n\nb\n\nj\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nn\n\n\n\n\n\na\njn\n\n\nb\njn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere N\n\nj\n is the j-th risk level in the evaluation process (j\u00a0=\u00a01, 2, \u2026, m), V\n\nj1\n, V\n\nj2\n, \u2026, V\n\njn\n are the value range of each index, a\n\nji\n and b\n\nji\n are the lower and upper limits of the corresponding characteristic indexes, respectively.\n\n(18)\n\n\nR\np\n\n=\n\n\nN\np\n\nC\n\nV\np\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\np\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n\n\n\n\nV\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\n\nV\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nn\n\n\n\n\nV\npn\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\np\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\np\n1\n\n\n\nb\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\np\n2\n\n\n\nb\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nn\n\n\n\n\n\na\npn\n\n\nb\npn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere N\n\np\n is expressed as a matter element, which is the set of all risk levels of the event; C\n\n1\n, C\n\n2\n, \u2026, C\n\nn\n are n-th control factors of matter element N\n\np\n; V\n\np1\n, V\n\np2\n, \u2026, V\n\npn\n are the value range of C\n\ni\n corresponding to matter element N\n\np\n; and a\n\npi\n and b\n\npi\n are the lower and upper limits of the corresponding characteristic indexes.\nStep 2: Determine the correlation between the evaluation index and each risk level:\nThe extension distance between the matter element to be evaluated and the classical domain and joint domain can be calculated by the following equation:\n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\nji\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\na\nji\n\n+\n\nb\nji\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nb\nji\n\n\u2212\n\na\nji\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\npi\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\na\npi\n\n+\n\nb\npi\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nb\npi\n\n\u2212\n\na\npi\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the classical domain and joint domain, the correlation between the evaluation index and the risk level can be calculated by the following equation:\n\n(20)\n\nK\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\u2208\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\npi\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\u2209\n\nV\nji\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03c1(V\n\ndi\n,\nV\n\nji\n) represents the distance between the matter element to be evaluated and the classical domain; \u03c1(V\n\ndi\n,\nV\n\npi\n) represents the distance between the matter element to be evaluated and the joint domain; K(V\n\ndi\n) is the correlation function of V\n\ndi\n; and V\n\nji\n\u00a0=\u00a0|b\n\ndi\n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0a\n\ndi\n| is the length of the interval.\nStep 3: Calculate the correlation between the object to be evaluated and the risk level:\nThe correlation degree between the object to be evaluated and the risk level N\n\nj\n can be calculated according to the weighted average method:\n\n(21)\n\n\nK\nj\n\n\n\nN\nd\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\nw\ni\n\n\nK\nj\n\n\n\nV\ndi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere w\n\ni\n is the weight corresponding to the index C\n\ni\n; and K\n\nj\n(N\n\nd\n)indicates the integrated correlation degree between matter element N\n\nd\n and the risk level j.

Section 3.2 of this paper introduces the combined weighting method used for determining the comprehensive weight of each risk evaluation index. Then the combined weighting method is applied to determine the comprehensive weight of each rockburst control factor, and it can be introduced into the matter-element extension theory to construct the rockburst tendency prediction model.\nThe flowchart of the rockburst tendency prediction model construction in this paper is depicted in three stages (Fig. 6\n): (1) rockburst tendency evaluation indexes determination, (2) comprehensive weight of each evaluation index determination based on TFN-AHP, CRITIC and MDI methods, and (3) rockburst tendency prediction model construction based on the matter-element extension theory.\n\n\n\n4\nRockburst tendency prediction of the Bayu Tunnel\nIn this section, 10 classic rockburst case data recorded during the excavation of the Bayu Tunnel are selected to construct the decision matrix in the objective weighting method. Next, two rockburst cases (the \u201cOctober 16\u201d moderate rockburst and \u201cApril 18\u201d strong rockburst) are used to illustrate the method of obtaining each rockburst evaluation index.\n\n4.1\nAcquisition of rockburst case data in the Bayu Tunnel\nAccording to the method recommended by the International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM) (ISRM, 1983), fresh rock blocks from the rockburst section were collected to produce cylindrical specimens with heights of 100\u00a0mm and diameters of 50\u00a0mm. The uniaxial compression test was carried out with the MTS815.04 electro-hydraulic servo rock test system from the Wuhan Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The test curve and corresponding mechanical parameter information are shown in Fig. 7\n and Table 4\n, respectively.\n\nFig. 8\n shows the variation process of the maximum tangential stress on the surrounding rock with mileage obtained by inversion of the in-situ stress (Zhang et al., 2020). Combining the uniaxial compression test data and maximum tangential stress value of the surrounding rock corresponding to the mileage in the rockburst section, the specific values of the stress control factor can be obtained, as shown in Table 5\n.\nThe measurement of the integrity of the rock mass in the rockburst section includes the in-situ sonic testing of the rock mass and sonic testing of the rock. Considering the fact that there will be excavation damage area after tunnel excavation, the wave velocity test data in this area will lead to a large error in the evaluation results of the integrity of the rock mass. Existing studies have shown that the range of the excavation damage zone can be determined by the test depth corresponding to the point where the wave velocity reduction rate in the hole is >10% (Sun et al., 2021). The arithmetic mean of the wave velocity test data at the measurement points outside the excavation damage area can be applied to calculate the undisturbed rock mass wave velocity. The curve of rock wave velocity with drilling depth is shown in Fig. 9\n. It can be seen from the figure that the surrounding rock in the above rockburst case is affected by excavation disturbance in the range of about 2\u00a0m. Therefore, 15 measurement points after the drilling depth is 2\u00a0m can be used to calculate the undisturbed rock wave velocity. The calculation results of the rock mass integrity control factors are shown in Table 6\n.\n\n\n4.2\nDetermination of subjective weight\nExisting research results (Zhang et al., 2020) show that the importance of controlling factors affecting rockburst hazards in descending order is as follows: rock mass stress state, rock brittleness, rock mass integrity, and rock elastic energy storage. The maximum tangential stress on the surrounding rock of the Bayu Tunnel at different mileages is distributed between 120 and 135\u00a0MPa, which is close to the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock samples, resulting in the rockburst intensity levels corresponding to the stress control factor results all being moderate or above, and the prediction results are excessively conservative. Therefore, the importance of stress control factors should be appropriately reduced. In addition, the brittleness index introduced in this paper can comprehensively characterize the physical and mechanical properties of rock brittleness and elastic energy storage, thus the importance of this control factor must be increased.\nIn conclusion, after summarizing the existing research results and the opinions of experts, the final judgment matrix is arranged in the order of rock physical and mechanical property, rock mass stress state and rock mass integrity, then these are combined with Eq. (4) to calculate the fuzzy comprehensive degree, as shown in Table 7\n.\nAfter obtaining the fuzzy comprehensive degree of each control factor, the possibility of the fuzzy comprehensive degree between the two control factorsS\n\ni\n\u00a0>\u00a0S\n\nj\ncan be calculated using Eq. (5), and the initial weight of each control factor can be determined according to Eq. (6). The calculation results and initial weights of the membership functions among the control factors are shown in Table 8\n.\nAfter obtaining the weight value of each control factor of rockburst tendency in the index layer, the final weight value of the subjective weighting method obtained after normalizing the weight value is as follows:\n\n\n\nw\nS\n\n=\n\n\n0.454\n0.319\n0.227\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nDetermination of objective weight\nIn this paper, 10 classic rockburst case data recorded during the excavation of the Bayu Tunnel on the Sichuan-Tibet Railway are selected to construct the decision matrix in the CRITIC method. For the calculation method of each control factor, refer to Section 4.1. The data of rock laboratory test and rockburst case are shown in Tables 9 and 10\n\n.\nNext, we use the CRITIC objective weighting method described in Section 3.3.1 to calculate the weights of control factors for the rockburst case data listed in Table 10. Since the three rockburst control factors in the table belong to the benefit-type index (the larger, the better), the correlation coefficient between the indicators can be calculated by forward processing the data into Eq.

(17) and (18), the correlation degree between the rockburst control factor and risk level and between the matter-element to be evaluated and the risk level can be respectively obtained, after which the corresponding rockburst risk level can be determined. Taking the two typical rockburst cases introduced in Section 4.1 as examples, the matter-element to be evaluated is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nd\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\nd\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nP\n\n\n\n0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nS\n\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nI\n\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nd\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nP\n\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nS\n\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\nI\n\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extension distances between each rockburst control factor and the classical domain and joint domain are calculated by Eq. (19), as shown in Tables 11 and 12\n\n:\nThen, based on the calculation results of the extension distance between each rockburst control factor and the classical and joint domains, the correlation between each rockburst control factor and the rockburst grade can be calculated by Eq. (20), as shown in Table 13\n:\nAfter calculating the correlation degree between each control factor and corresponding rockburst grade, and combined with the comprehensive weight of the rockburst control factor calculated in Section 4.4, the correlation degree between the matter element to be evaluated and the rockburst grade can then be calculated using Eq. (21). The greater the correlation degree (algebraic size relationship) is, the likelier the rockburst case is to be evaluated according to its corresponding rockburst grade. The corresponding rockburst intensity grade is evaluated as shown in Table 14\n:\nAccording to the above steps, the intensity of all rockburst cases listed in Table 10 can be predicted, and the results are shown in Table 15\n. The prediction results of this paper's model are fundamentally consistent with the actual rockburst level. Therefore, it can be considered that this method can effectively evaluate the rockburst tendency along the tunnel, from the laboratory test and field survey data collected during the feasibility study stage of the Sichuan-Tibet railway construction. In conclusion, it can be considered that this method can accurately evaluate the rockburst tendency of the Bayu Tunnel.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, a rockburst tendency prediction model integrating method of combination weighting and matter-element extension theory is proposed. The accuracy of the model is then verified by predicting the rockburst case data form the Bayu Tunnel on the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. Regarding the selection of rockburst control factors, previous related studies have typically used rock compression-tensile strength ratio \u03c3\nc\/\u03c3\nt, rock strength \u03c3\nc and rock elastic energy index W\n\net\n to characterize the control effect of rock physical and mechanical property on rockburst (Wang et al., 1998). This paper also introduces the brittleness index BICSS (Kuang et al., 2021) to characterize the control effect of rock physical and mechanical property on rockburst. This index can comprehensively characterize the physical and mechanical properties of rock brittleness and elastic energy storage, thereby greatly simplifying the calculation of the model.\nIn addition, while calculating the subjective weight of each rockburst control factor, considering that the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock samples is close to the maximum tangential stress of the surrounding rock at the corresponding mileage, the result of using the stress control factor to predict the tendency of rockburst is excessively conservative. Based on the existing research, appropriate adjustments to the importance of the stress control factors are made, so that it can be applied to the prediction of rockburst tendency in deep underground engineering with high ground stress. Although the reliability of the model in this paper has been verified through a rockburst case in the Bayu Tunnel project of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, its applicability and superiority still require discussion. In view of this, this chapter will verify the applicability and superiority of this model through the following two subsections.\n\n5.1\nApplicability verification of the model\nThis paper collects some rockburst case data (Zhou et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2016) from the Jinping I Hydropower Station, Jinping II Hydropower Station and Zhongnanshan Tunnel to verify the feasibility of the rockburst tendency prediction model. It is worth noting that this paper introduces a new brittleness index as the control factor of rockburst tendency. This factor must determine multiple parameters from the rock complete stress-strain curve for calculation. However, the existing studies on the prediction of rockburst tendency have rarely described the stress-strain curve of the rock. Therefore, a large number of data related to rock laboratory test with the same engineering background were collected in this study to act as the rockburst cases (Xu and Yan, 2012; Qiu, 2011; Li, 2010). It was found that the calculation results of the BICSS brittleness index under the same engineering background conditions were distributed between 20% and 30% of its average value.\nIn summary, the rock laboratory uniaxial compression data of which the BICSS calculation results are close to the mean value under various engineering backgrounds are selected to calculate the rock physical and mechanical property factors. Taking the value that fluctuates by 30% up and down from the calculation result as the floating interval, the stress control factor and rock mass integrity factor provided in the rockburst case are used to predict the rockburst tendency. The representative rock uniaxial compression test data under each engineering background are shown in Table 16\n, and the rockburst case data considering the error of the rock physical and mechanical property factor are shown in Table 17\n.\nNext, the rockburst tendency prediction model constructed in Section 4.5 is used to predict the rockburst case data in Table 17, and the comparison results between the predicted grade and the actual grade are shown in Table 18\n.\nIt can be seen from the table that the actual grade of the above rockburst cases are all within the range of the predicted grade calculated by this paper's model (The prediction results of the case data of the Jinping II Hydropower Station in the table are in the range of moderate to strong rockburst, while the actual rockburst grade is moderate rockburst, which is consistent with the prediction results). In other words, the application of the rockburst tendency prediction model constructed in this paper under the conditions of different engineering backgrounds has also exhibited satisfactory results.\n\n\n5.2\nVerification of the superiority of the model\nConsidering that the control factors selected in different rockburst tendency prediction models differ, this section takes the five rockburst cases mentioned in Section 5.1 as samples, and selects two commonly used rockburst tendency prediction models (Pei et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2020) to predict the data in the samples. The comparison between the prediction results and actual grade is shown in Table 19\n. It can be seen from the table that, with the exception of the inconsistency between the predicted grade of the Jinping I Hydropower Station and the actual grade, the predicted results of the remaining cases are generally consistent with the actual situation.\nThe author of this paper believes that the reason for this situation is that, in the rockburst case data of the Zhongnanshan Tunnel and Jinping II Hydropower Station tunnel, the rockburst grade interval where the value of each control factor is basically consistent, i.e. the result obtained by calculating a single control factor as a predictive index, can also be consistent with the actual rockburst grade. However, in the rockburst case of the Jinping I Hydropower Station, the rockburst grade intervals corresponding to the values of stress intensity ratio, rock compression tension ratio and elastic energy index are all strong rockbursts, yet the value of the rock mass integrity corresponds to no rockburst. In addition, the construction of the above two rockburst tendency prediction models underestimated the influence of rock mass integrity on the rockburst tendency, which led to inconsistency in the predicted results with the actual grade. Therefore, compared with the above two models, the rockburst tendency prediction model proposed in this paper can more accurately predict the rockburst case of the Jinping I Hydropower Station. The main reason for this is that, first, this paper uses a brittleness index for evaluating the physical and mechanical properties of deep rock to replace the rock compression-tensile ratio and elastic energy index in most prediction models, which is more highly targeted. In addition, considering the complex geomechanical environment of deep high in-situ stress underground engineering, a large number of rockbursts are controlled by structural planes (Li et al., 2012b). Based on the existing research, this paper appropriately improves the importance of rock mass integrity to the occurrence of rockbursts. Therefore, the rockburst tendency prediction model proposed in this paper possesses strong applicability and superiority in deep-buried and high in-situ stress underground engineering.\n\n\n5.3\nSignificance of control factors and comparison analysis on prediction effect between single factor and multiple factors\nIn this section, rockburst cases under different engineering background, with similar rock physical and mechanical property factors but large differences in stress control factors and rock mass integrity factors, are selected for evaluation (Xue et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Similarly, the rock laboratory uniaxial compression data of which the BICSS calculation results are close to the mean value under various engineering backgrounds are selected to calculate the rock physical and mechanical property factors. Taking the value that fluctuates by 30% up and down from the calculation result as the floating interval. The representative rock uniaxial compression test data under each engineering background are shown in Table 20\n, and the rockburst case data considering the error of the rock physical and mechanical property factor are shown in Table 21\n.\nAccording to the data in Table 21, two control groups are designed in this section to discuss the significance of the stress control factors and rock mass integrity factors. The first control group is the rockburst case of Jiangbian Hydropower Station and Bayu Tunnel (JPD1K195\u00a0+\u00a0101\u2013104 tunnel section), to discuss the effect of stress control factors on rockburst tendency. The second control group is the rockburst case of Jiangbian Hydropower Station and Jinping II Hydropower Station to discuss the effect of rock mass integrity on rockburst tendency. The rockburst tendency prediction model constructed in Section 4.5 is used to predict the rockburst case data in Table 21, and the comparison results between the predicted grade and the actual grade are shown in Table 22\n.\nAccording to the data in the table, the calculation results of the rock physical and mechanical property factors of the three rockburst cases all show a moderate rockburst tendency. In the first control group, the calculation results of the rock mass integrity factor in the rockburst cases of Jiangbian Hydropower Station and Bayu Tunnel are basically the same, showing a slight rockburst tendency, but the calculation results of stress control factor of Jiangbian hydropower station are lower than that of Bayu tunnel (slight rockburst). It can be seen from the above that the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the rock in the JPD1K195\u00a0+\u00a0101\u2013104 section of Bayu tunnel is 182.36\u00a0MPa, while in the Jiangbian hydropower station is 146.10\u00a0MPa, which shows that the biggest factor causing the difference in the calculation results of stress control factors is the in-situ stress of the rock mass. During the process of excavation in hard rock, the failure of the rock may not be able to consume the strain energy stored in the rock mass, resulting in a part of the energy being converted into kinetic energy to eject the rock and the occurrence of rockburst. Under the condition of certain rock physical and mechanical property and rock mass integrity, the greater the in-situ stress in the rock mass, the more strain energy stored in the rock mass, leading to more serious rockburst hazards. Therefore, the first control group illustrates the significance of stress control factors for predicting rockburst tendency.\nIn the second control group, the calculation results of stress control factors in the rockburst cases of Jiangbian Hydropower Station and Jinping II Hydropower Station are completely the same, showing a slight rockburst tendency. But the level of rock integrity calculation results of Jinping II Hydropower Station (no rockburst) is lower than that of Jiangbian Hydropower Station (slight rockburst). The rock mass integrity has a great influence on the mechanical properties of the rock mass. Low rock mass integrity means that the joints and fissures in the rock mass are relatively developed, which is not conducive to the storage of elastic strain energy in the rock mass, and reduces the probability of high-grade rockbursts. Therefore, the second control group illustrates the significance of rock integrity factor for predicting rockburst tendency.\nBased on the prediction results of rockburst tendency, it can be seen that the rockburst tendency predicted by this proposed method in this paper is highly related to the grade calculated by the rock physical and mechanical property factor (BICSS). But it is undeniable that the in-situ stress conditions and rock mass integrity also play a very important role in the occurrence of rockburst. If the case data is evaluated by the BICSS alone, the results of the three rockburst cases all show moderate rockburst tendency, which is seriously inconsistent with the actual rockburst intensity, while the results predicted by the model in this paper are completely consistent with the actual intensity. Therefore, the prediction of rockburst tendency by means of rock physical and mechanical property control factor alone has obvious defects.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, three main rockburst tendency control factors are selected as the evaluation indexes of the rockburst prediction model, and the combined weighting method is used to determine its comprehensive weight. Next, a rockburst prediction model based on comprehensive weights and the matter-element extension theory is established and applied to actual engineering. The main conclusions are as follows:\n\n(1)\nBased on the systematic analysis the control effect of rock physical and mechanical property, the surrounding rock stress state and rock mass integrity on rockburst, the brittleness index BICSS, the Russenes criterion and rock mass integrity coefficient are selected as the three main control factors of rockburst tendency, to act as the evaluation index of rockburst prediction model.\n\n\n(2)\nConsidering that each rockburst control factor plays a different role in the occurrence of rockburst hazards, and that the control factors are not strictly independent of each other, this paper uses a combination weighting method to assign weights to each rockburst control factor. Among them, the subjective weighting method qualitatively considers the relative importance of each rockburst control factor from the perspective of engineering experience, and uses the triangular fuzzy numbers to reduces the influence of experts' subjective deviation and preference on the evaluation results. The objective weighting method considers the independence of each rockburst control factor on the basis of respecting the rockburst case data. Finally, the comprehensive weight of each rockburst control factor is calculated by using the principle of minimum discrimination information.\n\n\n(3)\nA rockburst tendency prediction model based on matter-element extension theory is established. The model is used to evaluate 10 typical rockburst cases recorded in the excavation of the Bayu Tunnel. The predicted rockburst grade is shown to be consistent with the actual rockburst grade, which verifies the accuracy and applicability of this paper's model.\n\n\n(4)\nBased on a large number of deep engineering rockburst cases, and compared with the commonly used rockburst tendency prediction model, this model is shown to possess superior adaptability to rockburst risk assessment in areas with complex geological structures and stress environments, and further demonstrates the advantages of the model established in this paper. Finally, the necessity of selected rockburst multiple control factors in this method is discussed. If only one rockburst-inducing factor is considered to evaluate the rockburst tendency, it is often inaccurate. The results of this study will provide a new approach for the rockburst risk prediction of the subsequent deep tunnel project of the new Sichuan-Tibet railway.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nShaojun Li: Resources, Supervision, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

Canada and Russia have the most extensive areas of peatlands although extensive areas are found in northern Europe, especially Finland, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The geotechnical characteristics of peat from some of these countries have been well documented, for example by Landva (2007), Hendry et al. (2012), Sarkar and Sadrekarami (2020)\nHelenelund (1980), Carlsten (2000), Long and Boylan (2013), Den Haan et al. (1995), Den Haan and Kruse (2007), Den Haan and Feddema (2013), Zwanenburg and Jardine (2015) and Murano and Jommi (2021).\nHowever despite there being some 28,300\u00a0km2 of peat in Norway, representing 9% of the country's area (NIBIO, 2016), the geotechnical characteristics of Norwegian peat have not been well documented. In the past, where peat was encountered, it was simply excavated and replaced by imported fill material. In addition the impact on climate change of peatlands was not as well understood. It is estimated that 10,000\u00a0m2 of peat can store about 5000 tons of carbon (NPRA, 2015; Oksholen, 2020). Norwegian peat areas contain the carbon equivalent to Norway's total climate emissions for 66\u00a0years (SABIMA, 2015). As a result planning authorities have adopted new regulations prohibiting the cultivation of peat areas (Norsk-Lovtidend, 2020) and are reluctant to permit developments which involve the excavation and removal of peat (Menon-Economics, 2017; Milj\u00f8direktoratet, 2018; Milj\u00f8direktoratet, 2020; NPRA, 2015).\nTr\u00f8ndelag county in mid Norway is the largest peat region in Norway, where peat covers some 18% of its surface area. Peat samples were obtained from seven sites in the Trondheim area of Tr\u00f8ndelag and samples from six of these sites were subjected to a comprehensive series of 1D oedometer tests. The resulting geotechnical engineering properties are detailed and compared with those from other peat soils found worldwide.\nOne of the main geotechnical challenges with development on peat areas involves reliable prediction of both short and long-term creep type settlements. Existing empirical or analytical models designed for clay soils are known to be unreliable in peat, especially for cases where there are several loading stages, where the consolidation time needs to be estimated and in particular for the calculation of long-term settlements.\nThe need to better understand the geotechnical properties of peat, such as its yield stress, 1D compressibility and permeability, to permit development on these areas without removal of the peat is the focus of this work. Use of the widely available Soft Soil (SS) and Soft Soil Creep (SSC) models in the finite element software PLAXIS (PLAXIS, 2020) are explored using input data derived from the oedometer tests and empirical correlations published in the literature. The SS and SSC modelling is tested on the measured data from some full-scale field loading trials at two sites in Tr\u00f8ndelag. Guidance for future testing and modelling of peat soil for the purposes of predicting short and long-term settlements is provided.\n\n\n2\nPrevious geotechnical studies of Norwegian peat\nEarly work on the geotechnical properties of Norwegian peat involved studies on the applicability of peat as an impervious material for earth dams, with a focus on peat permeability (Tveiten, 1956). In the 1960's the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen) undertook some studies on the 1D compression of peat and Flaate (1968) published some empirical charts to permit the estimation of peat settlement due to the construction of road embankments. Later the same organisation reported on the use of lightweight fills, in the form of expanded polystyrene (EPS) blocks, to construct roads across peatlands (Frydenlund and Aab\u00f8e, 1989; \u00d8stlid, 1987). Kj\u00e6rnsli (1989) used Flaate's data together with some additional measurements to update the empirical charts for estimating settlement of road embankments on peat.\n\nGautschi (1967) reported on some trial embankments and testing of peat at sites near Kongsvinger (south east Norway) and Oslo. Helenelund et al. (1967) also report briefly on these trials. Janbu (1970) reports on some oedometer tests carried out on peat samples from a site in Steinanmyra in Trondheim, which is close to the sites under study here. Janbu (1970) showed that the behaviour of the peat was consistent with that of a wide variety of other materials using his tangent modulus approach. Hove (1972) carried out some measurements on the properties of peat and the settlement of noise protection bunds constructed at Heimdalsmyra in Trondheim. This is one of the sites studied here. Long and Boylan (2013) also reported on some of the data from this site. Herje (1978) summarised the experiences of building houses on peat areas in Trondheim during the years of 1972\u20131975. Flaate (1989) summarised some of the main geotechnical properties for peat when being used as a base sealer beneath landfills.\nMore recent work on Norwegian peat has included a study of the effects of a tunnel leakage on the overlying peatlands (Kv\u00e6rner and Snilsberg, 2008), the development of a 5\u00a0km temporary construction site road over a 3\u00a0m thick layer of peat (\u00d8iseth and Sleipnes, 2008), the use of airborne electromagnetic technology to map peat thickness (Silvestri et al., 2019) and the development of some sophisticated numerical models to study creep in peat (Boumezerane and Grimstad, 2015; Grimstad et al., 2017).\n\n\n3\nStudy sites\n\nPaniagua et al. (2021) present data for nineteen Norwegian peat sites where index data was available. Here seven of these sites in the Trondheim city area were chosen. Sampling, in situ testing, laboratory oedometer testing and shear wave velocity measurements were carried out during Summer 2019. The location of the sites, superimposed on the Norwegian Geological Survey map of the area, is shown in Fig. 1\n. A summary of the sites is also presented on Table 1\n. Six of the seven sites are located under the marine limit which is the highest former sea level in the area after disappearance of the ice. It means that the peat deposits under the marine limit were formed over a saline environment, and usually marine clays are found beneath. Only the Haukvatnet site is at a slightly greater elevation.\n\n\n4\nMethodology\n\n4.1\nSampling\nA peat sampler from Eijkelkamp was used to obtain a 52\u00a0mm diameter \u201chalf core\u201d of the peat over the full depth profile. This sampler is similar to the Jowsey auger (Jowsey, 1966). The peat was logged on site using the extended version of the von Post and Granlund peat classification system (Hobbs, 1986). Samples were taken for water content measurements and these were used later in conjunction with field shear wave velocity measurements (Vs). A photograph of a typical sample of Trondheim peat is shown in Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Data section of the paper.\nIn order to minimise sample disturbance effects, block samples of the peat from all sites, except Havstein, were obtained for laboratory compressibility testing by hand carving the material using a knife with a serrated cutting edge from the bottom of a hand excavated hole at between 0.5\u00a0m and 0.6\u00a0m depth and below the water table. The sampling procedures followed those recommend by ISSMFE (1981). Samples were transported to either the laboratories of the Norwegian University for Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim or to University College Dublin (UCD) in Ireland.\n\n\n4.2\nIn situ shear wave velocity measurement\n\nShear wave velocity (Vs) measurements are extremely valuable in site characterisation studies (e.g. distinguishing peat from gytta and soft clay), assessing sample disturbance effects, yielding parameters for numerical modelling (e.g. yield stress, pvy\u2019 and the small strain shear modulus, Gmax) and for use in making estimates of settlement (Long, 2022). Here Vs measurements were made in the field using the portable downhole sonde which was developed for the purposes of taking Vs readings through a vertical peat column by Trafford and Long (2020). A broad bandwidth geophone (10\u00a0Hz resonant frequency) is encompassed within a high-density polyethylene housing to form the sonde. The sonde was initially pushed to the bottom of the peat profile, down the same hole which was used for peat logging and water content sampling. The Vs readings were taken at the same depth intervals and frequency and down the same borehole as that used for logging the peat. Measurements were made as the sonde was retrieved at intervals of 0.1\u00a0m to create a continuous seismic profile through the full peat column. The transmitted shear wave was produced at the surface by striking a hammer against an instrumented block.\n\n\n4.3\nIndex testing\nWater content (oven dried at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u201348\u00a0h) and density measurements were carried out to the requirements of BS1377 (BSI, 1990a). The water content measurements were made at NTNU within 24\u00a0h of sampling. Organic content was obtained by determination of the loss on ignition at 440\u00a0\u00b0C for five hours (Arman, 1971).\n\n\n4.4\nLaboratory oedometer testing\nA summary of the oedometer testing carried out is given on Table 2\n. Three different test types were used. Incrementally loaded (IL) oedometer tests in accordance with BS1377 (BSI, 1990b) were carried out at UCD. The specimens were 76\u00a0mm in diameter and 19\u00a0mm high (H0) Each load was maintained for a period of 24\u00a0h as required by the British Standard.\nAt NTNU, incrementally loaded oedometer tests were carried out using the Janbu torv\u00f8dometer (peat oedometer) (Janbu, 1970). The apparatus has been also tested by Long and Boylan (2013). The sample is 54\u00a0mm in diameter and 50\u00a0mm in height. The motivation for using this equipment was that the specimens are thicker than the 19\u00a0mm to 20\u00a0mm for standard oedometers. Using thicker oedometer samples of peat is also standard practice in Sweden (samples 100\u00a0mm in diameter and 45\u00a0mm high) and in Finland (samples 150\u00a0mm in diameter and 100\u00a0mm high), see Carlsten (2000) and Helenelund et al. (1972). The load increments and loading period were as for the IL tests.\nAlso at NTNU, continuous rate of strain (CRS) tests were carried out to investigate strain - rate effects. These tests were undertaken on 50\u00a0mm diameter by 20\u00a0mm high samples using the procedures outlined by Sandb\u00e6kken et al. (1986). Three strain rates were initially used for Heimdalsmyra peat (3% \/ hour, 5% \/ hour and 10% \/ hour). Standard guidelines for CRS tests in Norway (NPRA, 2014) state that the strain rate must give pore pressures between 3% and 10% of the total vertical stress. The results of these tests are shown in Fig. S2 of the Supplementary Data section of this paper. The chosen rate of strain has little effect on the stress \u2013 strain and stiffness behaviour of the material. The two tests at the faster rates have higher permeability (kv) and coefficient of consolidation (cv) at stresses less than 15\u00a0kPa to 20\u00a0kPa. The results show that the samples which were tested at 90\u00b0 to the direction they are orientated in the ground (horizontal direction), had the same properties as those tested at the vertical orientation. Based on these tests the chosen rate for the remaining tests was 3% \/ hour.\n\n\n4.5\nLaboratory shear wave velocity measurements\nVs measurements were made in the laboratory using a simple uniaxial loading cell. Samples were 70\u00a0mm in diameter and typically 50\u00a0mm in height. Bender elements, 3\u00a0mm long, were built into the top and bottom platen of the equipment. The samples were confined within a perspex cylinder lined with 2\u00a0mm holes to allow drainage during consolidation. Once at the required consolidation stress, high frequency shear waves (2\u00a0kHz to 5\u00a0kHz) were transmitted through the sample to determine the Vs value. First arrival time was obtained using the approach recommended by Lee and Santamarina (2005).\n\n\n\n5\nLaboratory test results\n\n5.1\nDescription of peat\nVisually the peat was similar at all sites and comprised a brown to dark brown fibrous peat with some wood fragments (see Fig. S1). An exception to this is that the peat at Tanemsmyra comprised an orange-brown fibrous sphagnum peat. At the sampling locations. The peat thickness varied between 1.8\u00a0m (Tiller-Flotten) and 6.9\u00a0m (Tanemsmyra), with an average of 4.3\u00a0m.\n\n\n5.2\nTypical index test results\nRepresentative index test results for three of the sites are shown in Fig. 2\n. The three sites were chosen to represent that with highest water content (Tanemsmyra), lowest water content (Havstein) and a \u201ctypical\u201d site (Heimdalsmyra). A summary of the average index properties for the peat on each site is given on Table 3\n.\nBroadly speaking the peat at all seven sites is similar. The most significantly different site is that at Tanemsmyra which has the highest water content, a corresponding lowest shear wave velocity and is the only site where significant deposits of sphagnum peat were encountered. The sites at Dragvoll, Heimdal, Havstein and Tiller-Flotten have been influenced by land drainage measures in the past. This could have influenced the rate of natural decomposition of the peat and the current water content. The site at Havstein has the lowest water content and highest shear wave velocity. The von Post degree of humification (H), fine fibre content (F), coarse fibre content (R) and wood content (W) are similar for all sites. The sites at Leirbrumyra, Havstein and Haukvatnet have slightly higher H value. This may be associate with their similar geographical location, site orientation and geological background. These three sites are located at the western part of Trondheim, where the sunlight is more limited during the wintertime compared to the sites located towards the east (www.suncurves.com).\nThe peat at all the sites has very high organic content (loss on ignition - LOI) with only that at Havstein and Haukvatnet being less than 90%.\n\n\n5.3\nGeneral stress \u2013 strain \u2013 time behaviour\nA comparison between the results of two torv\u00f8dometer tests and two incrementally loaded tests for the Tiller-Flotten peat (water content 807% - 960%) is shown in Fig. 3a and b. Here linear strain (\u03b5\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394H\/H0, where H0\u00a0=\u00a0original sample thickness) versus root time curves for 5\u00a0kPa and 80\u00a0kPa applied stress are shown so a comparison can be made for stresses lower than and well above the yield stress. There is good consistency between each of the two test types. The difference between the IL tests and torv\u00f8dometer tests is reflects the natural material variability of the peat. In addition to the differences in the resulting deformation between the IL and torv\u00f8dometer tests, consolidation at low stresses took place much more rapidly in the torv\u00f8dometer as can be seen by the location of the point corresponding to 90% consolidation (t90) on the curves. At higher stresses the differences are not as pronounced. A similar finding was made by Samson and La Rochelle (1972) who showed that the difference between the field and laboratory data diminished as the load increased. Issues related to the effect of sample thickness on the rate of settlement of peat have been dealt with by Hobbs (1986) and others.\nThe compression versus log time plots for all five increments of a Tiller-Flotten IL test ML5 are shown in Fig. 3c. All the curves seem to be linear after approximately 20\u00a0min, which might give an indication of the onset of secondary compression in conventional soil mechanics terms. The creep rate is much lower for the 5.1\u00a0kPa and 9.9\u00a0kPa loading increments than for the remaining load increments. This suggests that after 9.9\u00a0kPa the yield stress of the sample has been exceeded. This will be discussed in more detail below.\nSome typical IL, torv\u00f8dometer and CRS test results, in this case for Tiller-Flotten peat, are shown in Fig. 4\n. The data are presented in (a) log stress (\u03c3v') versus linear strain (\u03b5\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394H\/H0) format, (b) linear \u03c3v' versus \u03b5, (c) constrained modulus Mt (=\u0394\u03c3v'\/\u0394\u03b5) versus \u03c3v', (d) creep coefficient Csec (\u0394\u03b5\/\u0394logtime), (e) coefficient of permeability (kv) versus \u03c3v' and finally (f) consolidation coefficient (cv) versus \u03c3v'. In general, the results of the CRS and IL tests are very similar. An exception to this might be in the Mt values at stress greater than about 40\u00a0kPa. In this paper the comparisons are made between the derived parameters and correlations published in the literature made for stresses lower than 40\u00a0kPa since these are the operational stress in most practical cases.\nThe stress-strain, stiffness and creep behaviour of the peat in the torv\u00f8dometer tests is very similar to that in the CRS and IL tests. However, the rate of consolidation, and therefore the resulting kv and cv values, are very different for the torv\u00f8dometer tests. The torv\u00f8dometer samples were prepared by trimming them to 54\u00a0mm diameter on a soil lathe as opposed to the technique of pushing a steel ring carefully into a block of peat to prepare the CRS and IL samples. It is possible that some leakage along the side of the torv\u00f8dometer specimen resulted in the higher rate of pore pressure dissipation in these samples compared to the CRS and IL tests. Therefore in the subsequent sections kv and cv values from the torv\u00f8dometer tests are omitted from the discussion.\nA comparison between the test results from this project and data published previously for Norwegian peat by Kj\u00e6rnsli (1989) is shown in Fig. S3 of the Supplementary Data section of the paper. Kj\u00e6rnsli obtained some of his data from a personal communication with Janbu and also from Flaate (1968). The results from this project fit well with previously published data.\n\n\n\n6\nEngineering properties of peat\nAll the engineering properties as derived from the various oedometer tests are summarised on Table 2. The parameters are discussed in the order in which they are obtained in oedometer testing, i.e. pre-yield stiffness first, followed by a discussion on the yield stress, post yield stiffness, creep and finally permeability and rate of consolidation.\n\n6.1\nConstrained modulus at in situ stress (M0) and at yield stress (ML)\nSome typical plots of constrained modulus (Mt) versus versus \u03c3v\u2019 are shown on Fig. 4c. In engineering design the specific individual values often used are the constrained modulus for loads below the yield stress (M0) and those around the yield stress (ML). M0 values are very low and vary between 0.1\u00a0MPa and 0.9\u00a0MPa with an average of about 0.6\u00a0MPa and show a weak trend of decreasing M0 with increasing wi, see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Data section of this paper. The values for the IL and CRS tests are similar and slightly less than those from the torv\u00f8dometer. It is possible that the top cap of the torv\u00f8dometer was not in perfect contact with the peat sample for the first loading increment. This needs further investigation. Similar M0 results were obtained by Long and Boylan (2013) for some Norwegian and Irish peats and by Helenelund (1969) for Finnish peat.\nML values are similar for all test types and show a clear pattern of decreasing ML with increasing wi, see Fig. S5 of the Supplementary Data section. Values decrease from about 0.08\u00a0MPa at 600% water content to 0.04\u00a0MPa at wi equal to 1600% and are very similar to the data published by Carlsten (2000) for Swedish peat.\n\n\n6.2\nYield stress (pvy')\nGiven the importance of the determination of the preconsolidation \/ yield stress in the prediction of settlements on soft soils significant emphasis was placed on the determination of this parameter. Use of the term \u201cpreconsolidation stress\u201d is considered inappropriate for peat as the process of material formation was not by normal sedimentation. Here the term \u201cyield stress\u201d (pvy\u2019) is used to nominally divide elastic and plastic behaviour (Chandler et al., 2004; Vaughan et al., 1988). The reasons why peat shows a yield stress are complex. Lefebvre et al. (1984) observed such an yield stress in the field and attributed it to snow loading, drainage, water table fluctuations and the creep characteristics. Hobbs (1986) also suggested that the structure of the plants and the decaying process that takes place in the upper layers of peat contributes to this \u201ccritical pressure\u201d. Yield stress will also depend on fibre content, degree of decomposition and sampling technique as well as the season of sampling (e.g. relative to the ground water table) (Petrone et al., 2008).\nThere is no well accepted method for determining pvy' in peat. Here four methods have been used namely the classical Casagrande (1936) and Janbu (Janbu, 1963; Janbu, 1969) techniques, as well as the \u201cwork method\u201d of Becker et al. (1987) and by examination of the relationship between Vs and consolidation stress (\u03c3vc'). Some typical Vs versus \u03c3vc' plots for Tiller-Flotten and Heimdalsmyra peats are shown in Fig. 5a. Prior to measuring Vs the samples had been consolidated and the resulting strains and new thickness measured. The power function association between Vs and \u03c3vc' observed by others (Santamarina et al., 2001) is not seen here and the relationship between the two parameters is closer to linear. Yoon et al. (2011) have suggested that if the data are plotted in a semi-logarithm format, as shown in Fig. 5b, the yield stress can be obtained directly from the point of intersection of the two resulting straight lines. This suggests that pvy' for Heimdalsmyra is slightly greater than that for Tiller-Flotten, consistent with the findings from the other techniques and the likely influence of the more extensive drainage at Heimdalsmyra.\nIn addition, an assessment of the creep rates at different stress, as for example shown in Fig. 3c, was used to estimate pvy'. There were only small differences between the results using the different techniques and from the different test types. The Casagrande and Janbu methods gave the highest average pvy' of about 11\u00a0kPa. All the others yielded an average of some 10\u00a0kPa. The average pvy\u2019 obtained from the various methods are plotted against initial void ratio (e0) in Fig. 6\n. Data for St. James Bay peat in Canada, which is similar to that under study here has been added to the figure (Ajlouni, 2000). Kogure and Ohira (1977) first suggested that pvy\u2019 of peat was closely linked to initial void ratio e0. Ajlouni (2000) re-examined their original relationship and suggested pvy\u2019 (kPa)\u00a0=\u00a0150\/e0. The data measured here shows the same trend of decreasing pvy' with increasing e0 but the trend line is slightly below (lower pvy`) than that proposed by Ajlouni (2000) with a trend line of pvy\u2019 (kPa)\u00a0=\u00a0110\/e0 best fitting the data.\n\n\n6.3\nCompression index (Cc) and modulus number (m)\nAs can be seen from the data presented in Fig. 4a, the value of the compression index (Cc) has to be chosen with caution as the e (or \u03b5) versus log \u03c3v\u2019 plot is non-linear. Here, Cc values have been selected for stresses \u2248 pvy\u2019\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0kPa as this is often the range of loading of most interest to practicing engineers. Values of Cc are plotted against initial water content in Fig. 7\n. As would be expected there is very good agreement between Cc and wi. There are many correlations published in the literature on the relationship between Cc and wi. Up to a wi of about 800% the data fits well with the correlations proposed by Hobbs (1986) or Korhonen (1958). Beyond wi of 800% the measured Cc values exceed those predicted by these two correlations. This finding is consistent with that of Kj\u00e6rnsli (1989) who found Korhonen's correlation often formed the lower bound of measured data. However all of the test results fall within the linear relationship Cc\u00a0=\u00a0wi\/100 proposed by Mesri and Ajlouni (2007).\nIn Scandinavian practice settlement in the normally consolidated zone is often determined using the modulus number m, which is the slope of the Mt versus \u03c3v' curve after pvy', see Fig. 4c. Values of m (again for stresses \u2248 pvy\u2019\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0kPa in the case of the CRS tests) are plotted against dry density (\u03c1d) in Fig. S6 of the Supplementary Data section. Compared to soft clays and silts the m values are very low. The IL and CRS test values are in broad agreement with the values for Finnish clays published by Helenelund (1969), the trendline proposed by Carlsten (2000) for Swedish peat and also some values published by Janbu (1970) for tests from Steinanmyra in Trondheim. However the torv\u00f8dometer values are lower than either of the two other sets and this may be an effect of the thicker sample in the torv\u00f8dometer.\n\n\n6.4\nRecompression index (Cr)\nOnly the UCD IL tests included an unloading stage, which allowed the determination of recompression index Cr. The average Cr\/Cc value was about 0.12 which is within the range 0.1 to 0.3 suggested by Mesri and Ajlouni (2007).\n\n\n6.5\nCreep coefficient (Csec or C\u03b1)\nThe creep coefficient, Csec or C\u03b1 depending on its definition (Csec\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394\u03b5\/\u0394logt and C\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394e\/\u0394logt), is often used by engineers predicting secondary compression in the field. As consolidation was relatively rapid sufficient data was generated in each load increment to reliably determine Csec. Here it was always determined for time interval 100 mins to 1000 mins (see Fig. 3c) for consistency. Csec values for all loading increments for a typical test are shown in Fig. 4d. Like Cc, all of the values for the load increment \u2248 pvy\u2019\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0kPa are plotted against initial water content in Fig. 8a. Both sets of tests show similar results. Most of the data is close to the mean value of about 0.025 reported by Carlsten (2000) for Swedish peats. The findings here are consistent with those of Hobbs (1986) who suggested Csec was largely independent of water content, especially when wi exceeds about 300%. The two exceptions are the results for Tiller-Flotten which show relatively high values of Csec. The reason for this is not clear but the range of measured values is consistent with the limits 0.03 to 0.09 for peat suggested by Janbu Janbu (1970).\nAlthough it does not directly give a prediction of in situ strain, many researchers and engineers prefer to use C\u03b1 (=\u0394e\/\u0394logt) rather than Csec as it is used in the correlation between C\u03b1 and Cc, first introduced by Mesri and Godlewski (1977). This proposes that values of C\u03b1\/Cc are in the range 0.01 to 0.07 for all geotechnical materials. For peat, Mesri and Ajlouni (2007) suggest C\u03b1\/Cc\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01. Mesri and Chen (1994) have pointed out that Cc and C\u03b1 need to be chosen consistently and to that end the values at \u2248 pvy\u2019\u00a0+\u00a020\u00a0kPa have been selected here.\nThe data plotted in Fig. 8b follows the trend of C\u03b1\/Cc equal to 0.06 up to Cc of about 8. For values greater than 8 there is significant scatter around the 0.06 line with the two Tiller-Flotten tests showing very high values as discussed above.\n\n\n6.6\nCoefficient of permeability (kv)\nPeat is well known to display large values of permeability at in situ effective stress (kv0) due to the open fabric and large void ratios. The great variability in the nature and arrangement of the peat fabric results in a wide range of permeability values (Ajlouni, 2000). In addition it is well accepted that the kv value subsequently decreases rapidly with increasing stress. In this project kv0 values (i.e. at about 5\u00a0kPa) were determined from the cv value obtained from the IL tests as well as the interpretation of the pore pressure data from the CRS tests by following the procedure outlined by Tavenas et al. (1983). The value of the pore pressure is taken to be two thirds that measured at the specimen base (Sandbaekken et al., 1986). The resulting values of are plotted against e0 and wi in Fig. 9\n and Fig. S6 of the Supplementary Data section respectively. In Fig. 9 the measured data are compared to the empirical trendlines proposed by Mesri and Ajlouni (2007) and Kj\u00e6rnsli (1989). These two sets of trendlines are more or less identical. The data fall within the two (albeit widely spaced) trendlines. The data for the CRS tests are one half to one order of magnitude greater than those from the IL. The differences are perhaps at least partly due to the different interpretation methods involved. This finding is consistent with that of Ajlouni (2000) who found CRS tests on James Bay peat yielded values 1 to 10 times greater than those obtained from the other measurements.\nThe same data are plotted against wi in Fig. S6 of the Supplementary Data section. There is no clear trend in kv0 with wi. However the data fall close to the trend lines suggested by Carlsten (2000) and Kj\u00e6rnsli (1989).\nThe slope of the strain to log coefficient of permeability relationship is denoted by \u03b2 and is defined:\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b2\n=\n\n\n\u2206\nlogk\n\n\n\u2206\n\u03b5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b2 values are plotted against wi in Fig. S8 of the Supplementary Data section. There is a faint relationship of decreasing \u03b2 with increasing wi as has been found by others but the trend falls below that of Carlsten (2000) for example. However the data fits very well with the range of values suggested by Helenelund (1969).\n\n\n6.7\nPoisson's ratio (\u03bd)\nValues for Poisson's ratio (\u03bd) for peat and organic soils tend to be low, perhaps close to zero in many cases and in the range 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2. For example Den Haan and Kruse (2007) found \u03bd increased with increasing density from values less than 0.2 for peat with a density of 1000\u00a0kg\/m3 to about 0.25 for organic soil with a density of about 1400\u00a0kg\/m3.\n\n\n\n7\nOn settlement calculations in peat\n\n7.1\nBrief summary of settlement calculations in peat\nInternationally, several theories specific for the prediction of settlement on peat have been developed based on simple empirical and semi-empirical correlations e.g. Flaate (1968), Al-Khafaji and Andersland (1981), Edil and Mochtar (1984), Edil and Simon-Gilles (1986), Stinnette (1998), Den Haan and El Amir (1994), Carlsten (2000), Sas et al. (2011), Szymanski et al. (2005), Noto (1987), Hayashi et al. (2016). It is difficult to make general statements on the success or otherwise of these methods for predicting settlement in peat. They are usually developed based on local correlations and with few parameters that vary with the method selected. These methods are primarily intended to enable a quick and approximate estimations and usually calibrated based on specific measurements making it challenging for generalisation. However it seems that primary settlement is often relatively well predicted but that secondary compression or creep is often underestimated (Lefebvre et al., 1984; Nichols et al., 1989) and that it is difficult to correctly predict the development of settlement with time.\n\n\n7.2\nNumerical calculation method adopted in this work\nThe various simplified methods, mentioned in the previous section, are not rigorous enough to handle the important aspects of settlement during both primary and secondary consolidation phases. They usually lack a through theoretical framework, but this emanates from the fact that they are primarily intended to be used for approximate first-hand estimations. While this is useful aspect of the simplified methods, there might arise instances where a more rigorous analysis was required, e.g. involving multiple loading sequences and creep deformations. In this work an attempt is made to address some of these issues. For this purpose the focus here is on the Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model available within the finite element program PLAXIS (2020). The SSC model (Grimstad and Nordal, 2018; Neher et al., 2001; Stolle et al., 1999; The et al., 1998; Vermeer and Neher, 1999; Vermeer et al., 1998) uses the isotache principle to deal with compression and the CamClay for shear strength. It is designed to deal well with settlement due to stress changes, creep, ageing (creep hardening), stress relaxation and critical state shear deformations. The isotache concept (\u015cuklje, 1957) adopted in SSC enables modelling of the unique stress-strain-strain rate relationship through the entire consolidation phases. With this framework, the resulting yield stress is dependent on strain rate and this is a key aspect in modelling of soft clays and peats. For a complete and thorough description of the SSC model, as well as the background isotache theory, the reader is referred to the articles mentioned above and to the PLAXIS manuals (PLAXIS, 2020).\nIt is recognized that SSC is limited by assumptions such as ignoring anisotropy and\/or fabric which are important in peat. It is also acknowledged that more advanced models exist within the research community that attempt to take into account such features, see for example Teunissen and Zwanenburg (2015), Boumezerane et al. (2015) or Grimstad et al. (2017). However these advanced models require knowledge on the material behaviour that requires field and laboratory tests well beyond standard engineering practice. The authors believe that SSC is a model that can give the most reliable predictions with input based on the results of standard geotechnical tests and empirically derived parameters as discussed in Section 6.\nResults from two full-scale field cases are used to illustrate on how to overcome some of the limitations of the SSC model as well as on how to pick parameters to give an acceptable agreement between measured and simulated behaviour.\n\n\n\n8\nDescription of full-scale loading tests and backanalysis\nIn this section a brief description of two field cases in the Tr\u00f8ndelag area is presented followed by the practical use of the established correlations for peat parameters with the SSC model. In both cases monitoring data is available with which to compare the numerical predictions.\n\n8.1\nThe Selva Agdenes case study\nThis project involved the construction \/ upgrading of a standard two-lane road between the villages of Selva and Agdenes approximately 45\u00a0km north-west of Trondheim. The road is constructed over a mountainous area comprised of areas of bare rock interspersed with deposits of peat. In the area under study the peat thickness varies between 0.4\u00a0m and 2.0\u00a0m. Measured settlements after 5\u00a0months varied between 9\u00a0cm and 60\u00a0cm and increased approximately linearly with peat thickness. The cross section chosen for detailed analysis was at Profile 250 (Fig. 10a), where the peat is 2.0\u00a0m thick and the embankment height was 2.4\u00a0m.\nThe peat properties in the study area are shown in Fig. 10b. At Profile 250 wi is relatively low and varied between 300% and 500%, with an average of 355% and von Post H was 5 indicating the peat is moderately decomposed. The ground water table was measured to be at 0.95\u00a0m depth.\n\n\n8.2\nThe Heimdalsmyra case study\nSome of the work at Heimdalsmyra has previously been reported by Hove (1972) and by Long and Boylan (2013). At this site full-scale loading trials included the monitoring of 2.5\u00a0m, 3\u00a0m and 4\u00a0m noise protection bunds, which were constructed using excavated peat from another area, and also of a 0.5\u00a0m thick gravel platform (to mimic site access roads and car parking) which was constructed directly on the peat.\nHere the behaviour of the peat in some field compressometer tests (Janbu and Senneset, 1973) will be reported and modelled. The purpose of the tests was to provide input parameters for the design of the noise protection bunds, access roads and other hard standings. The set-up for these tests is shown in Fig. 11a. The 16\u00a0cm cast iron screw plate was initially screwed down to the required depth by hand. A hydraulic jack is connected to the outer pipe system which transmits the external forces during installation and the reaction forces during load testing. A series of inner pipes are connected to the screw plate for the purposes of load application. The inner and outer pipes are connected during installation. On reaching the required depth the connection between the two sets of pipes is released. The reaction force during loading is mainly taken by the anchor frame as shown in Fig. 11a, with settlement gauges connected to an independent anchored frame.\nHere the focus is on a test conducted at Station 5 at a depth of 1\u00a0m. Three load steps were applied up to a maximum stress of 30\u00a0kPa. Each load step lasted 120\u00a0min. This test has been chosen for analysis as the loading involved steps less than and well above pvy'.\nThe peat at Station 5 in Heimdalsmyra is very different from that at Selva Agdenes (Fig. 11b to 11d). The peat is about 2.1\u00a0m thick, has wi of between 650% and 1200% with an average of about 900% and von Post H of 7 to 8, indicating a strong to very strong level of decomposition. The average density of the peat is about 1050\u00a0kg\/m3. The water table is close to ground surface.\n\n\n8.3\nInput parameters for SSC model\nA summary of the input parameters for the peat for use in the SSC modelling at both sites is given on Table 4\n. Some notes on the selection of the parameters are as follows:\n\no\ne0 is the initial void ratio\u00a0=\u00a0wi*Gs, where Gs the specific gravity is taken to\u00a0=\u00a01.5 as LOI exceeds 90% (Den Haan and Kruse, 2007).\n\n\no\n\u03b3 is the unit weight.\n\n\no\n\u03bb* is the modified compression index \n=\n\n\nC\nc\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n1\n+\n\ne\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n, see Fig. 7.\n\n\no\n\u03ba* is the modified recompression index \n\u2248\n\n\n2\n\nC\nr\n\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n1\n+\n\ne\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n, see Section 6.4, for volumetric compression.\n\n\no\n\u03bc* is the modified creep index \n=\n\n\nC\n\u03b1\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n1\n+\n\ne\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n, see Fig. 8.\n\n\no\n\n\u03bd is Poisson's ratio, see Section 6.7. Generally low values were chosen here to ensure the highest possible elastic shear stiffness to predict realistic horizontal deformation. In doing so a relatively higher value of \u03bd is used for Selva Agdenes due to a significantly lower water content and a lower degree of decomposition as compared to Heimdalsmyra. The Poisson's ratio adopted for Heimdalsmyra is 0.0 while for Selva Agdenes 0.15. These values are also consistent with the Gmax interpreted from the shear wave velocity measurements. Some more details on the choice of appropriate values of \u03bd for analyses such as these are given by Long et al. (2020).\n\n\no\nPOP is the pre-overburden pressure \n=\n\n\np\nvy\n\n`\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n0\n\n\n`\n\n, where \u03c3v0\u2032 is the in situ vertical effective stress and pvy' can be obtained from Fig. 6. POP is an alternative to overconsolidation ratio (OCR), and both can be used in PLAXIS to specify the initial stress state (or initial size of the reference surface). However, for cases where the initial effective stress is very low POP is more convenient to use. A key factor for the use of the SSC model is the selection of appropriate parameters to ensure the correct initial state, including the initial creep rate (Waterman and Broere, 2005).\n\n\no\n\nWaterman and Broere (2005) recommend, that in parallel with choosing OCR \/ POP, the user should also consider the creep ratio: (\u03bb*\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03ba*) \/ \u03bc* which should typically fall within the range of 10 to 20 for most practical cases, with the highest values representing stiff soils which exhibit little creep. Here values of 12.5 and 13.8 are computed using the parameters in Tables 2, 3 and 4.\n\n\no\nK0\nNC is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure in the normally consolidated condition. In this case K0\nNC values have been determined from empirical correlations published in the literature (Ajlouni, 2000; Den Haan and Feddema, 2013).\n\n\no\nThe strength of the material in the SSC model is limited to the lesser of the boundary of the cap surface (M parameter determined based on K0\nNC) and what is limited by the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) surface (defined by the friction angle, \u03c6, and the dilatancy angle, \u03c8). These parameters need to be consistent with one another. In the SSC model M is calculated from:\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\nM\n=\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nK\n0\nnc\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n2\n\nK\n0\nnc\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nK\n0\nnc\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03c5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\u2217\n\n\n\u03ba\n\u2217\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\u2217\n\n\n\u03ba\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n2\n\nK\n0\nnc\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nK\n0\nnc\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\nsin\u03c6\n=\n\n\n3\nM\n\n\n6\n+\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\no\nIt is acknowledged that the chosen friction angle for peat is unusually high. Similar high values have been reported for peat from many other countries. Mesri and Ajlouni (2007) give a useful summary of international work on this topic. Den Haan and Kruse (2007) and others explain that the reinforcing effects of the mostly horizontally orientated fibers contributes to this effect and point out that the high frictional angles are mostly associated with low effective stress levels.\n\n\no\nA tension capacity for the peat (\u03c3t\u00a0=\u00a0c - cot\u03c6) can be applied based on cohesion (c) and friction angle. Here \u03c3t values of 2\u00a0kPa to 3\u00a0kPa have been used depending on the degree of decomposition (H) and water content of the peat (Dykes, 2008). These are assumed to be isotropic due to the limitations of the model.\n\n\no\nkv0 and kh0 obtained from Figs. 9 and S7.\n\n\no\nPLAXIS makes use of Ck, which is the permeability change index defined as:\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nC\nk\n\n=\n\n\n\u2206\ne\n\n\n\u2206\nlogk\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n+\n\ne\n0\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b2 is obtained from Section 6.6 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Data section. The values chosen are consistent with the recommendation of Mesri and Ajlouni (2007) who suggested Ck\/e0 for peat is about 0.25.\n\n\n8.4\nSimulation of oedometer test\nTo complement the analysis of the full-scale field tests it was decided to initially simulate some oedometer test results, see Fig. 12\n. This work would also serve to check and calibrate the input parameters. These simulations are all one-point analyses, so pore pressure dissipation is not considered. The sample depth was assumed to be 1\u00a0m, the input parameters chosen were those for Selva Agdenes (Table 4) with the water table assumed to be at ground level as observed on site.\nThe results (in log \u03c3v' versus \u03b5 and \u03c3v' versus Mt format) are shown in Fig. 12 and compared to results of the two CRS tests from this study (from Heimdalsmyra) which had water content closest to that measured at Selva Agdenes. The simulation captures the measured behaviour very well.\n\n\n8.5\nDetails of full scale simulations\nThe 2.4\u00a0m thick embankment at Selva Agdenes (Fig. 10a) was modelled as being placed gradually over a period of 40\u00a0days, before consolidating for the remaining period (a period of 540\u00a0days was used in the simulation as this is the period for which data is available). After 540\u00a0days the 0.6\u00a0m surcharge load was removed in the real situation but was not modelled here as no data was available for this condition. In total 516, 15-noded elements were used in the plane strain analysis with symmetrical conditions assumed around the center line, see Fig. 10a. The silty clay (bottom boundary) was assumed impermeable. Updated Lagrangian analysis was used for both the mesh and the pore pressure (to allow for buoyancy effects). The same three steady state pore pressure profiles, as assumed for the CRS test simulations were assumed.\nFor the Heimdalsmyra, the 0.16\u00a0m diameter field compressometer screw plate was analysed using an axisymmetric model with a circular steel plate of radius 0.09\u00a0m and a thickness of 20\u00a0mm, see Fig. 11a. The 1\u00a0m deep vertical open hole, in which the screw plate was placed, was assumed to be filled with water in the model to mimic that part of the peat disturbed by the installation of the screw plate. Thus it is assumed that the opening created by installation of screw plate is supported by this \u201cmud\u201d pressure. A relatively fine finite element mesh was used with 568, 15-noded elements, in total. Rigid and closed boundaries were assumed at 2.4\u00a0m depth and the width of the model was 2\u00a0m (Fig. 11a). Rough interface elements were used between the plate and the peat. This interface was extended 30\u00a0mm both vertically and horizontally at the edge of the plate. Again the Lagrangian updated mesh option was used.\nThe stress distribution is dealt with in the finite element method code by consideration of compatibility, equilibrium and the material model. The experiment is challenging to model exactly due to it being a three-dimensional problem with complex boundary conditions. Here it is modelled numerically by approximating the screw plate geometry by an impermeable circular shape. This allowed an axis-symmetric model to be used, as mentioned above.\n\n\n8.6\nResults for analysis of Selva Agdenes embankment\nThe results of the settlement versus time predictions are compared to the measurements in Fig. 13\n. Only surface settlement measurements are available for this site. Note that due to construction related conditions on site and the fact that the final measured point (Day No 540) was surveyed some time after the others, the Contractor indicted he placed a little less reliability on this point compared to the others. A reasonable match is obtained between the measured and predicted settlements. Output from the Soft Soil (SS) model in PLAXIS is also shown for comparison. This model is essentially the same as SSC except no creep is allowed for. The SS model predicts less settlement than SSC and this is particularly the case for the long term situation, e.g. the 20\u00a0year predictions shown.\nIt is also interesting to note that the simple empirical method of Carlsten (2000) underpredicts the settlement.\n\n\n8.7\nResults for analysis of Heimdalsmyra field compressometer test\nThe results of the compressometer load test simulation are compared to the measurements in Fig. 14\n. In Fig. 14a and b each of the three load steps are shown separately, with linear and log time scales respectively, and in Fig. 14c all three load steps are combined. The final predicted settlement is very close to that measured. However, some differences are noted:\n\no\nThe deformation during the first load step is under-predicted by about 1\u00a0mm (22%). This is due to the balance in attempting to have as high a Gmax as possible (by assuming \u03bd\u00a0=\u00a00.0 as discussed earlier) and as low a \u03ba* as it was reasonable to assume.\n\n\no\nThe prediction for Step 2 is very close to the measured data. This result is encouraging as it involves an application of stress at a level often encountered in practice.\n\n\no\nThe third loading step, that takes the stress well above pvy', results in too high settlement predictions. This compensates for the underprediction in Step 1. This finding is due to the non-linearity in \u03bb* around pvy' and the requirement that \u03bb* is matched for total strain past pvy', using a secant value, and not for the incremental strain. It is also noted that the time evolution of settlement is very sensitive to the permeability (and the permeability change) as the drainage path around the edge of the relatively sharp plate assumed in the analysis is likely to have been different from that around the actual more rounded screw plate. This could also partly explain the slightly more delayed response in the field compared to the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nLarge areas of Norway are underlain by peat. However despite its importance from the point of view of infrastructure construction on peatlands and from a carbon retention perspective its engineering properties are poorly understood. The objective of this paper was to document the characteristics and engineering properties of peat from the Trondheim area to address this research gap. In engineering projects in peat often the resulting settlements are of greatest concern. Therefore here the data obtained from the laboratory tests as well as correlations from the literature are used to make some settlement predictions and these predictions are compared to full scale field measurements. Some conclusions of the study are as follows:\n\no\nAt the seven Trondheim sites studied the peat is broadly similar, comprising brown fibrous peat with relatively high water content and low degree of decomposition. At one site (Tanemsmyra) the material is unusually thick and contains significant deposits of orange-brown sphagnum peat.\n\n\no\nDespite being visually relatively homogenous the properties of the peat were found to vary significantly over short distances.\n\n\no\nThree different oedometer test types were used. The two test types with standard sized specimens (20\u00a0mm high) gave very similar results. The peat in the thicker (50\u00a0mm) torv\u00f8dometer tests consolidated more rapidly perhaps due to some drainage along the sides of the specimen, resulting from the way in which the specimens were prepared. The use of the larger torv\u00f8dometer sample is motivated by the desire to test a more representative sample of peat compared to the very small samples used in the CRS and IL tests. However the differences in the test results found here warrants further investigation.\n\n\no\nShear wave velocity measurements both in the field and the laboratory proved very useful for characterising the peat, determining its yield stress and for providing input parameters for the numerical modelling.\n\n\no\nThe yield stress of peat is of particular importance in numerical modelling and the determination of the yield stress as reliably as possible was one of the main tasks of this work. There is no single approach appropriate for determining the yield stress of peat. Here four different methods were used, and the average value obtained was shown to be consistent with data and empirical correlations published in the literature.\n\n\no\nThe 1D compression parameters (e.g. Cc, Csec, M0 and ML obtained from the laboratory tests also compared well with published correlations. Similarly the permeability values were within published limits. However these published limits, for a particular water content or void ratio, can result in a wide variation in the chosen permeability value, perhaps by several orders of magnitude. It is recommended that further work is carried out to study the relationship between index properties and permeability of peat.\n\n\no\nAlthough the Soft Soil Creep (SSC) model, as employed in this study, is considered to be an advanced model, all of the input parameters can be obtained from the relatively standard tests reported here, empirical correlations found in the literature and from the simulation of element tests (such as an oedometer test).\n\n\no\nHere results of modelling two full scale field cases showed that the SSC model captured reasonably well the vertical settlement versus time behaviour of the peat for the duration of measurement. The peat at the two sites varied between low water content moderately humified peat to high water content highly decomposed peat.\n\n\no\nParticular care needs to be taken in specifying pre-overburden pressure (or yield stress) which is important in deciding the initial strain rate and in selecting stiffness parameters which are appropriate to the stress range and the problem under consideration.\n\n\no\nSSC is a model already used in the practice for modelling settlement of soft soils. The demonstrations presented in this work are considered to contribute towards an effort to encourage practitioners to use this form of modelling for peat and thus bridge the gap between research and practicing engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nData availability\nAll the laboratory testing and field data generated during this study are available from the corresponding author by request.\n\n","32":"","33":"","34":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nClay buffer is a critical component of engineered barrier systems (EBS) for long-term management of high-level radioactive waste, specifically in repositories constructed in crystalline and fractured rock. The clay buffer acts as a barrier between the metallic containers containing high-level (heat generating) radioactive waste and the host rock. The clay swells after absorbing water, fill out the gaps\/fractures in the rock, and create a stable surrounding environment for containers. However, the clay buffer may be susceptible to erosion by the flowing groundwater with low salinity in the fractures due to the formation of unstable colloidal sol at the clay\/water interface (Schatz et al., 2013; Sane et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2015). Experimental investigations (Schatz et al., 2013; Sane et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2015; Missana et al., 2018; Alonso et al., 2018; Bouby et al., 2020) presented evidence that the clay buffer can be eroded at the rock-clay interface by water percolating through faults\/micro-fractures. If such fractures intersect with the bentonite barrier at the depositional holes of the radioactive waste, they can provide spaces for the bentonite to swell and eventually eroded. This could facilitate the escape of radionuclides to host rock earlier than expected (Schatz et al., 2013).\nCommercially available bentonite clays widely studied in the literature, such as MX-80, FEBEX, and GMZ, contain a larger fraction of smectite mineral (usually montmorillonite and as major mineral present in the composition) and a smaller fraction (10\u201325%) of accessory minerals, such as quartz, plagioclase, illite, kaolinite, feldspar, calcite and gypsum (Schatz et al., 2013; Saba et al., 2014; Brachman et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2012 &2019; Reid et al., 2015; Alonso et al., 2019). Accessory minerals are reported to affect the erosion of bentonite (Birgersson et al., 2009; Richards and Neretnieks, 2010; Kiviranta and Kumpulainen, 2011; Reid et al., 2015; Schatz, 2016). Understanding their role in the expansion and erosion of bentonite is therefore important and should be incorporated in the assessment of clay buffer erosion. This paper presents a model for analysing the behaviour of less soluble accessory minerals during re-saturation and expansion of bentonite and their impact on erosion of bentonite barrier, which can underpin advanced fitness-for-purpose assessments of clay buffers. We specifically focus on those accessory minerals that their dissolution and precipitation are considerably slower (e.g. quartz) than that of soluble accessory minerals (e.g. gypsum,calcite and albite) at the environmental conditions and time scale in which erosion happens.\nExperimental results for expansion\/swelling and erosion of natural bentonite in fractures showed that a mineral film (detritus film) was formed during the swelling that could eventually clog fractures (Birgersson et al., 2009; Richards and Neretnieks, 2010; Reid et al., 2015; Schatz, 2016). Jansson (2009) observed a dark rim of accessory minerals (mainly feldspar) evident at the gel\/sol interface in artificial fracture tests. Experimental observations suggest that accessory minerals could be beneficial in reducing buffer erosion at the bentonite-rock interface. For example, experiments with disk-shaped specimens showed that an accessory mineral ring of 2\u00a0mm thickness was formed at the expansion front of bentonite, and the ring was effective in mitigating against further erosion of clay buffer (Reid, 2016). Buffer mass erosion rate from the fracture was reduced from 6.6\u00a0g\/year to 2\u00a0g\/year when this protective mineral ring was formed.\nCurrent understanding of the processes involved in bentonite expansion and erosion has been achieved mainly through extensive experimental studies in the last decade, while the developments in predictive modelling have been rather limited (Liu et al., 2009; Neretnieks et al., 2009 & Neretnieks and Moreno, 2018; Moreno et al., 2011; Navarro et al., 2017; Asensio et al., 2018; Lavi\u00f1a et al., 2018; Sedighi et al., 2021). Deformation\/swelling of compacted bentonite is commonly modelled by thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical (THCM) coupling (Sane et al., 2013; Navarro et al., 2014 & 2021; Nasir et al., 2017; Sedighi et al. 2015a & 2018). A different approach, based on DLVO electro-static forces theory (Liu et al., 2009; Neretnieks et al., 2009), has been proposed to capture the expansion\/extrusion behaviour of bentonite, specifically saturated with low density. The original DLVO models could not describe the entire swelling process from an initial unsaturated to fully saturated bentonite and are also unable to simulate the stress field within the material, but they are simpler than THMC models, as the swelling is represented as an effective diffusion process. This has been used to develop extensions by Moreno et al. (2011), Neretnieks et al. (2017), Sedighi et al. (2021) and Yan et al. (2021) that capture the combined effects of swelling and erosion of pure smectite clay. These improved models, however, do not allow for incorporating accessory minerals and their effects on the erosion process.\nThe present work addresses the deficiency in the existing models by developing a new formulation for interactions between smectite and less soluble accessory minerals during swelling to explain further the behaviour observed in experimental studies (Reid et al., 2015; Reid, 2016; Schatz, 2016; Alonso et al., 2018). The theoretical developments are limited to bentonite consisting of smectite and insoluble accessory minerals. It is noted that the dissolution of soluble minerals, such as feldspar, gypsum and calcite, may lead to variations of water chemistry (Sedighi et al., 2015b & 2018). The model developed in the work allows for investigating the effect of water chemistry but does not explicitly account for the presence and dissolution of soluble minerals. The focus is on understanding the formation of mineral film (detritus film) due to deposition of less soluble accessory mineral and its impact on swelling\/erosion of bentonite buffer. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the model development for the expansion of bentonite and co-transport of less soluble accessory minerals. Section 3 presents validations of the model with two sets of experimental data. Section 4 presents results for the effects of several key factors - water chemistry, filtration coefficient and mineral content - on bentonite expansion and erosion. Further, it describes an application of the model to the assessment of the long-term performance of the buffer. Conclusions from the work are drawn in Section 5.\n\n\n2\nConceptual model development\nThe less soluble accessory mineral particles are mechanically and chemically stable and have less electrical charge than the smectite particles. The experimental observations have shown that the fine mineral particles are co-transported with smectite gel, when the gel swells due to the strong repulsive forces between the smectite particles (Neretnieks et al., 2009). Fig. 1\n presents the swelling process of bentonite (containing accessory minerals) and its conceptual representation. Fig. 1a shows the transport of a mineral (gypsum) within the smectite gel with high-resolution secondary electron (SE) images (Daniels et al., 2021). The conceptual representation of the microscopic swelling of mineral rich bentonite is shown in Fig. 1b. To simplify the mathematical formulation, the less soluble accessory minerals are assumed to be very fine (approximately equal to the smectite particles), suspended non-reactive particles attached to smectite plates. The mineral particles can be deposited at locations where the repulsive forces between the smectite particles are weak and cannot support the accessory mineral particles, as illustrated by Fig. 2\n. Such locations are generally at the interface between the swelling bentonite and flowing water. The detached accessory mineral particles have been reported to gradually build up a mineral film at this interface (Reid et al., 2015). The accessory mineral film contains pores of sizes <300\u00a0nm and is expected to slow down the expansion and erosion of bentonite (Neretnieks and Moreno, 2018).\n\n2.1\nEquation of motion\nParticles have irregular shapes and different sizes in raw or natural bentonite. This is simplified in the proposed model by assuming that the stacks of smectite (plate-like) and mineral (sphere-like) particles have uniform dimensions and properties as shown in Fig. 3a. Each unit of smectite and less soluble accessory mineral particles (see Fig. 3b) is subject to several different forces, including gravity (F\n\ng\n), buoyant force (F\n\nb\n), diffusional force (F\n\n\u03bc\n), viscous drag force (F\n\n\u03b7\n), attractive van der Waals forces (F\n\nA\n) and repulsive double layer forces (F\n\nR\n). These forces are shown in Fig. 3b. These forces determine the expansion or contraction of bentonite (Liu et al., 2009). The accessory mineral particles are assumed to be attached to the smectite plates (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) during the co-transport process.\nThe force on the particle due to the combined influence of gravity and buoyancy can be expressed by:\n\n(1)\n\n\nF\ns\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nV\np\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\np\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\n\n\ng\n\n\nwhere, F\n\ns\n is the sum of F\n\ng\n and F\n\nb\n; V\n\np\n and \u03c1\n\np\n is the volume and density of the unit formed by smectite and accessory mineral particles (see Fig. 3b); \u03c1\n\nw\n is the density of water and g is acceleration of gravity.\nAttractive van der Waals forces (F\n\nA\n) acting between particles can be presented by\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\nA\n\n=\n\n\n\nA\nH\n\n\nS\np\n\n\n\n6\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nh\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n\n\nh\n+\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n+\n\n1\n\n\n\nh\n+\n2\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, A\n\nH\n is the Hamaker constant, S\n\np\n is the surface area of the smectite plates, h is the separation distance between the smectite plates; \u03b4\n\nc\n denotes the thickness of smectite particles.\nThe separation distance between the smectite plates (h) can be linked to the solid volume fraction of smectite (\u03d5\n\nc\n) described by (Laxton and Berg, 2006)\n\n(3)\n\nh\n=\n\n\u03b4\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\nc\nmax\n\n\n\u03d5\nc\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03d5\n\nc\n\n\nmax\n is the maximum smectite solid volume fraction.\nRepulsive double layer forces (F\n\nR\n) due to the presence of electrical charges on the smectite particles is given by (Liu et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2021)\n\n(4)\n\n\nF\nR\n\n=\n2\ncRT\n\nS\np\n\n\n\ncosh\n\ny\nm\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nwhere, c is the ionic concentration in the pore water, R is the universal gas constant and T is absolute temperature; The function y\n\nm\n represents the scaled electric potential at the midpoint between parallel plates.

(27) takes into account the two experimental observations mentioned in the introduction (Reid, 2016; Schatz, 2016; Neretnieks and Moreno, 2018): when the repulsive forces between smectite plates are strong, the Heaviside function takes value of 1, and the suspended mineral particles are co-transported with smectite plates; when the repulsive forces between smectite plates are weak and the plates move randomly and independently (Brownian motion), then the Heaviside function becomes zero, and the suspended mineral particles are deposited due to the gravity.\nGoverning Eqs. (24)\u2013(27) are solved in non-local framework and implemented in Pyramid (Yan et al., 2020), which is a peridynamic (PD) computational framework. PD is capable for addressing such high non-linear transport process with the wide range of coefficient variations, which may yield gross computational errors by using meshed based approach (e.g., finite difference method). Eqs. (24)\u2013(27) may also be solved by using finite element approach although the selection of mesh and time step should be carefully due to the nonlinearities and couplings of the model (Schatz et al., 2013). The state variables of the formulations are the amounts of substances (represented by their fractions, e.g. \u03d5\n\nc\n(x,\nt) and \u03d5\n\nm\n(x,\nt)) and the fluxes of these substances (e.g. J\n\nc\n(x,\nt) and J\n\nm\n(x,\nt)).\n\n\n\n3\nModel validations\nThe validation of the present model has been performed by comparisons of model predictions with experimental data for two cases reported in the literature. Section 3.1 deals with expansion of bentonite containing accessory minerals in a fracture system. Section 3.2 deals with swelling of bentonite containing sand in a column test. The corresponding initial and boundary conditions to the problems are given at the start of each problem.\n\n3.1\nExpansion of bentonite containing accessory minerals in a fracture system\nTo assess the role of accessory minerals in bentonite expansion and erosion behaviour, Schatz (2016) performed a series of experiments in 1\u00a0mm-aperture artificial fracture system using MX-80 bentonite (85% smectite and 15% accessory mineral). The MX-80 bentonite was compacted into dense disk-shape samples with effective smectite dry densities of 1.6\u00a0g\/cm3. The sample was then exposed to Grimsel groundwater, which mainly contains 0.04\u00a0g\/L NaCl and 0.016\u00a0g\/L CaCl2 (corresponding to 0.68\u00a0mM Na+ and 0.14\u00a0mM Ca2+). It is reported that the sodium bentonite, when contacted with calcium solution, is expected to equilibrate rapidly with the solution due to the ion exchange reaction Ca2+\/Na+ (Karnland et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2021). Consequently, the ion concentration is assumed to be 0.96\u00a0mM Na+ in the solution. The initial solid fraction of smectite and accessory minerals outside the bentonite sample (r\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0mm) is set to 0. The solid fraction of smectite and accessory minerals at r\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0mm is set to 0.6 and 0.106, which is imposed as a boundary condition (Yan et al., 2021). The top, bottom, left and right boundary of the domain are fixed with no-flux boundaries. The result of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses of the bentonite mineralogical composition (Schatz, 2016) is shown in Fig. 4\n.\nExperimental result showed that: (i) accessory mineral ring builds near the extrusion\/erosion interface; and (ii) the thickness of the mineral ring grows progressively with time. The model described in the previous section was used to simulate this experiment. The parameters used for the simulation are listed in Table 1\n.\n\nFig. 5\n shows the results of the simulation for the distribution of bentonite solid volume fraction (\u03d5\n\nc\n, Fig. 5a), mineral solid volume fraction (\u03d5\n\nm\n, Fig. 5b), porosity evolution in the fracture (Fig. 5c) and the ratio of bentonite\/mineral along the fracture (Fig. 5d). The extrusion distance of bentonite is larger than that of accessory mineral. For example, the extrusion distance of bentonite and accessory mineral is 70\u00a0cm and 66\u00a0cm. In addition, \u03d5\n\nm\n at the expansion front increases with increasing expansion (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5(d) shows a comparison between the experimental data and numerical results obtained at different filtration coefficient (10\u00a0m\u22121, 40\u00a0m\u22121, 70\u00a0m\u22121, 100\u00a0m\u22121). The filtration coefficient providing the best prediction is 70\u00a0m\u22121. The results highlight the ability of the present model to capture the main experimental observations - the build-up of accessory mineral ring and its growth with time (Fig. 5b). The following sections aim at understanding the expansion behaviour of bentonite containing accessory minerals and quantifying the effects of the accessory mineral on the overall long-term behaviour of bentonite buffer.\n\n\n3.2\nSwelling of bentonite containing sand\nThe experimental data reported by Cui et al. (2019) for studying the one-dimensional free swelling of GMZ bentonite-sand mixtures is used to validate the present model. The GMZ bentonite samples is a light grey sodium-rich bentonite with 63.8% smectite, 18.7% sand and 17.5% others (e.g., feldspar, cristobalite). The sample is compacted to 61.8\u00a0mm(diameter)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mm(height) and placed at the bottom of the 61.8\u00a0mm(diameter)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060\u00a0mm(height) cylindrical mould. Two cases were considered to study the effects of sand ratio on swelling performance of GMZ bentonite. Case one is the free swelling of GMZ bentonite without any extra additional sand. Case two is the free swelling of GMZ bentonite with 30% additional sand. The sand content ratio is defined as Rs (%), the ratio of the sand's dry mass to the bentonite's dry mass (Cui et al., 2019). The dry density of samples for case 1 and case 2 is 1.59\u00a0g\/cm3 and 1.81\u00a0g\/cm3, respectively. The extrusion strain of a sample is defined as \u03f5\u00a0=\u00a0\u2206H\/H\n0, where \u2206H and H\n0 are the vertical deformation and the initial height of the sample, respectively. A threshold value of \u03d5\n\nc\n and \u03d5\n\nm\n (e.g. 10\u22126) is used to quantify the extrusion front of the swelled sample. The initial condition is given by:\n\n(28)\n\n\n\u03d5\nc\n\n\nx\nt\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nc\n,\n0\n\n\n\n\nx\n<\n\nH\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nx\n\u2265\n\nH\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(29)\n\n\n\u03d5\nm\n\n\nx\nt\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nm\n,\n0\n\n\n\n\nx\n<\n\nH\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nx\n\u2265\n\nH\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile the boundary conditions in which no bentonite particles can escape through the upper and the lower boundaries of the test tube:\n\n(30)\n\n\nJ\nc\n\n\n0\nt\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(31)\n\n\nJ\nm\n\n\n0\nt\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(32)\n\n\nJ\nc\n\n\nH\nt\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(33)\n\n\nJ\nm\n\n\nH\nt\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\nThe material properties and parameters used for the simulations have been adopted from several literature sources and are given in Table 1, with the following exceptions. The thickness of GMZ bentonite plate, the Kozeny constant, surface charge of particles and filtration coefficient are assumed to be \u03b4s\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0nm, k\n0\n\u03c4\n2=13, \u03c3\n0=-0.08 Cm\u22122 and k\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0m\u22121, respectively (Liu et al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2019).\n\nFig. 6\n shows the results for bentonite-sand mixtures at different NaCl concentrations for the two sand content ratios (e.g. Rs\u00a0=\u00a00% and 30%). The model captures the effects of both sand content and ion concentration.\nThe experimental results indicated that the swelling behaviour of GMZ bentonite-sand mixtures were varied with the sand ratio and water chemistry. The test data demonstrated that the increase of sand ratio in the bentonite mixture may significantly decrease the bentonite swelling strain or restrain the swelling properties of bentonite. This is because that uncharged larger sand content contributes to a larger friction coefficient among bentonite particles and smaller expansion rate. This effectively limits the expansion behaviour of the bentonite-sand mixtures. The model developed in this study theoretically explains why sand does not contribute to the swelling of bentonite mixtures corresponding to the experimental observations (Cui et al., 2012) and how it inhibits the expansion of the bentonite mixtures. The results above indicate that the addition of quartz sand into bentonite may inhibit better the expansion\/erosion of buffer material exposed to saline groundwater (Zhang et al., 2012). Increasing ion concentration leads to decreasing bentonite swelling strain. The effect of salinity can be explained from a microscopic perspective. Decreasing water chemistry enhances the DDL repulsive force (Eq. (4)), which reduces the swelling pressure and subsequently the measured swelling strain. The validations presented above provide confidence that the proposed model may be used to account for the effects of the salinity and additional mineral (e.g. sands) on bentonite swelling behaviour.\n\n\n\n4\nEffects of less soluble accessory minerals on the extrusion of compacted bentonite\nThis section presents a numerical investigation of the effects of some key variables including water chemistry, filtration coefficient and mineral ratio on the expansion and extrusion of MX-80 bentonite that contains 10% addition less soluble accessory minerals (e.g., quartz). The length of one-dimensional calculated domain is 80\u00a0mm. The solid volume fraction of smectite and accessory mineral are fixed at 0.6 and 0.105 at the left boundary (x\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0mm). No flux boundary is fixed at the right boundary (x\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0cm). The initial content of smectite and accessory mineral in the domain is zero. The fracture aperture (\u03b4\n\nf\n) is 1\u00a0mm. Fig. 7\n shows the illustration of geometry and boundary conditions for the problem. The parameters used for the simulations are listed in Table 1.\n\n4.1\nEffects of water chemistry\n\nFig. 8\n shows the effects of water chemistry, including c\u00a0=\u00a0deionised water (DI), 0.5\u00a0mM, 10\u00a0mM and 100\u00a0mM, on the distribution of solid volume fraction of smectite (Fig. 8a) and accessory mineral (Fig. 8b) along the x direction.\nThe results show that the water chemistry has dual effects on bentonite and less soluble accessory mineral expansion: (i) the extrusion distance decreased with increasing ion concentration; and (ii) the larger solid volume fraction of smectite is observed at the sharper expansion fronts for the higher water chemistry. From a microscopic perspective, the swelling behaviour is governed by the expansion velocity (Eq. (15)), which is largely controlled by the DDL repulsive force (Eq. (10)). Higher ion water chemistry induces a lower DDL force, which reduces the expansion velocity. A larger amount of smectite accumulated at the expansion front for a higher water chemistry (e.g., c\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0mM and 100\u00a0mM) may protect the buffer from erosion. Experimental studies demonstrated that bentonite buffer is susceptible to erosion for clay solid content below a certain value (e.g. \u03d5\n\nc\n<4%) and ionic strengths below 10\u00a0mM (Neretnieks et al., 2009; Schatz et al., 2013).\n\n\n4.2\nEffects of less soluble accessory mineral content\n\nFig. 9\n shows the effect of less soluble accessory mineral content (e.g., \u03d5\n\nm\n=0, 0.06, 0.18, 0.3) on the distribution of solid volume fraction of smectite (Fig. 9a) and accessory mineral (Fig. 9b) along the x direction. The results show that, similarly to the ion concentration (Fig. 8b)., the accessory mineral content has a dual effect on bentonite expansion: (i) the extrusion distance decreases with increasing accessory mineral content; and (ii) the sharper expansion fronts are observed for the larger accessory mineral content. Increasing the less soluble accessory mineral content can increase the accessory mineral profile and decrease the bed porosity, which enhances the friction force (Eq. (7)) and the expansion rate (Eq. (16)). The increase of less soluble accessory mineral content directly reduces the swelling rate of smectite (Fig. 9a), reflected in reduced expansion distance and smectite volume fraction distribution. For example, the swelling distance of smectite decreases from 68\u00a0mm to 46\u00a0mm when the less soluble accessory mineral content is increased from 0 to 0.3. The results indicate that the presence of additional less soluble accessory minerals in bentonite can effectively limit the expansion\/erosion behaviour of bentonite. Clearly, neglecting the effect of less soluble accessory minerals leads to an overestimation of expansion\/erosion rate.\n\n\n4.3\nEffects of filtration coefficient\nThe value of filtration coefficient, which is mainly controlled by the size of the particles and the pore size distribution, is generally obtained by the filtration experiments. The value of filtration coefficient was reported to have a range between 1\/\u00a0m and 100\u00a0m\u22121 for the fracture systems (Tsang and Neretnieks, 1998). Fig. 10\n shows the effect of filtration coefficient (e.g., k\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a00, 30\u00a0m\u22121, 70\u00a0m\u22121and 100\u00a0m\u22121) on the distribution of volume fraction of smectite (Fig. 10a) and accessory mineral (Fig. 10b) along the x direction. The results show that increasing filtration coefficient may delay the expansion of smectite and accessory mineral. Additionally, the solid volume fraction of less soluble accessory mineral is largely increased with the increase of filtration coefficient (Fig. 10b). Increasing filtration coefficient enhances the deposition of accessory mineral particles, which causes the increase of the volume fraction of less soluble accessory mineral. Additionally, the increase of less soluble accessory mineral solid fraction profile induces a reduction of bed porosity, which results in the decrease of expansion distance of smectite and the volume fraction distribution profile.\n\n\n4.4\nCombined effects of water chemistry and accessory mineral content on mass extrusion\nThe extruded mass into the fracture is directly related to the long-term behaviour of bentonite due to the decrease of density of bentonite buffer. The question investigated here is the role of less soluble accessory minerals in the expansion\/erosion protection of bentonite by deposition and formation of accessory mineral film. Fig. 11a shows the transient extrusion behaviour of bentonite buffer under different less soluble accessory mineral content (e.g., \u03d5\n\nm\n=0, 0.06, 0.18) and water chemistry (e.g., Groundwater, GW and Seawater, SW). Fig. 11b shows the mass extrusion rate as a function of less soluble accessory mineral content and water chemistry. Mass extrusion rate (E\n\nr\n) can be obtained by integrating the change of solid volume fraction of smectite (\u2202\u03d5\n\nc\n\/\u2202t) in the calculated domain, which is achieved by:\n\n(34)\n\n\nE\nr\n\n=\n\n\n\u2202\n\nm\next\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u222b\n0\n\n\u03b4\nf\n\n\n\n\u222b\n0\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u222b\n0\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n\u03c1\ns\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\u03d5\nc\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\nr\nd\nr\nd\n\u03c6\nd\nz\n\n\nwhere,m\n\next\n is the extruded mass of bentonite buffer.\nThe extrusion distance of the bentonite without accessory minerals may reach 13.5\u00a0cm after 30\u00a0days (Fig. 11a). Increasing \u03d5\n\nm\n to 0.18 leads to the reduction of extrusion distance to 12\u00a0cm at 30\u00a0days for groundwater intrusion. Additionally, increasing \u03d5\n\nm\n from 0 to 0.18 results in a two-fold decrease of the mass extrusion rate at 30\u00a0days. More specifically, after 30\u00a0days 5.2\u00a0g and 2.65\u00a0g bentonite are lost from the original buffer for \u03d5\n\nm\n\u00a0=\u00a00 and \u03d5\n\nm\n\u00a0=\u00a00.18 due to the groundwater intrusion. This indicates that the presence of minerals could reduce the loss of bentonite by a factor of 2 compared to pure smectite bentonite. The reduction of extruded mass is caused by the deposition of accessory mineral detritus in the calculated domain, which can effectively clog the pores and lead to smaller mass loss.\nIt is noted that the extruded mass calculated from the present model for the case without accessory minerals (e.g., 4.9\u00a0g) agrees well with the experimental observation from Schatz et al. (2013) (e.g., Test 11, 4.83\u00a0g). The extrusion distance and mass extrusion rate for seawater (SW, c\u00a0=\u00a0175\u00a0mM) is much smaller than for groundwater (GW, c\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mM). The result indicates that increasing water chemistry may be an effective way to inhibit the extrusion of buffer as higher ion concentration induces lower internal repulsive forces between particles (e.g. DDL).\nInterestingly, the mass loss rates for GW and SW are similar at 30\u00a0days although the two systems differ greatly in extrusion behaviour. The mass loss rates are mainly controlled by the extrusion distance, solid fraction distribution and fracture apertures (see Eq. Eqn 34). SW with higher ionic concentration enhances the distribution of solid fraction of bentonite although the extrusion distance is effectively decreased (see Fig. 8a). Consequently, the rise of bentonite solid fraction profile can amend the decrease of mass loss induced by the reduction of extrusion distance.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nA model for co-transport of smectite particles and less soluble accessory mineral particles during expansion of bentonite has been presented. The model provides explanations for the role of less soluble accessory minerals in the erosion protection of bentonite observed in experiments. The less soluble accessory minerals are transported with the smectite as it swells and deposited at the location where the repulsive forces between smectite particles become weak, i.e., at the interface region between the bentonite and the water. The accuracy of the model was tested against data from two sets of experimental data form literature. It was demonstrated that the model reproduced the main experimental observations of build-up of mineral film and of its growth with time.\nThe model was used to study parametrically the effect of water chemistry, filtration coefficient and accessory mineral ratio on the swelling and erosion of bentonite containing less soluble accessory minerals. It was shown that higher ion concentration, larger filtration coefficient and larger mineral content reduced the swelling of bentonite. Larger filtration coefficients and larger less soluble accessory mineral content enhanced mineral deposition and increased bed porosity, which effectively reduced the swelling and erosion rates. This observation was used to determine quantitatively the mass extrusion behaviour of bentonite containing accessory minerals in fracture systems. The results showed that the presence of minerals could reduce the loss of bentonite by a factor of 2 compared to pure smectite bentonite. This suggests that assessments of erosion of bentonite containing less soluble accessory minerals based on experimental data obtained with pure smectite may be overly conservative. It should be emphasized that the co-transport model developed in this work is based on the DLVO theory, and therefore may not describe adequately the behaviour of compacted bentonites at very low water contents.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nHuaxiang Yan: Investigation, methodology, software, validation, visualization, writing-original draft, writing-review, editing\n\nAndrey P.

In part this is due to age related deterioration of geotechnical assets, many of which are operating well beyond the limit of their design life (Briggs et al., 2019). For example, in the United Kingdom, significant elements of the canal and rail networks were constructed in the 1700s and 1800s and were often poorly engineered (e.g., Gunn et al., 2016), and are therefore displaying particularly poor condition. Moreover, landslide frequency and slope instability is predicted to increase further as the effects of climate change become more prevalent (IPCC, 2014), and in response to changing land use and land cover (Winter et al., 2010; Meneses et al., 2019). Recent effects of changing precipitation patterns have highlighted the vulnerability of transport infrastructure slopes to climatic variations, with numerous failures and major disruption to critical infrastructure (Crozier, 2010). Issues associated with aging assets and climate impacts are being exacerbated by increasing urbanization and hence increasing traffic (Hugenschmidt, 2010). As such, there are rising pressures placed on transport networks, and in an age where the transport network is operating at maximum capacity in many places, slope failures on these networks have the potential to result in considerable negative economic, social, and environmental impacts.\nIndeed, between 2014 and 2018, there were 381 earthworks failures on assets managed by Network Rail, in addition to 290 temporary speed restrictions relating to asset condition (Network Rail, 2018). Social implications of disruption to transport infrastructure also arise due to delays to travel (Jaroszweski et al., 2014). This highlights a need for monitoring and management of both natural and man-made slopes that affect infrastructure in order to mitigate against such failures.\nTraditionally, transport infrastructure slopes are monitored using walkover inspections, to visually identify surface expressions of failure, such as tension cracks (Gunn et al., 2016; Power et al., 2016; Smethurst et al., 2017). In the UK, Network Rail uses risk-based prioritization in the management of approximately 200,000 earthwork assets, combining the likelihood of failure for a particular slope (based upon visual observations) with the likely consequence of failure in a particular location, in order to target and prioritize management (Power et al., 2016). However, vegetation on the surface of the slopes can obscure signs of weakness, and slopes often fail rapidly without precursor signs of instability developing on the slope surface. Discrete point geotechnical surveys are often used in earthworks monitoring to complement visual surveys, but they provide detail about only a small volume of the subsurface. This is problematic as earthwork cuttings and embankments, in particular those built during the industrial revolution, are often highly heterogeneous. As such, discrete point sampling cannot capture the complexity of the subsurface in earthworks assets, which is required if accurate slope stability assessments are to be made (Gunn et al., 2016). In addition, soil sampling disturbance can lead to poor estimates of material properties.\nA recent major UK review of railway earthworks management (Mair et al., 2021) identifies key themes and recommendations for improving the serviceability of the transport network and mitigating slope failure. One such recommendation refers to a need to assess the condition of earthworks assets and to identify changes in the subsurface, with a focus on novel technologies. Geophysical techniques present an opportunity to do this, providing detailed subsurface information about large volumes of earthwork structures, and reducing the need for invasive geotechnical investigation. The Network Rail (2018) also recommends a move to remote failure detection. Geophysical surveys have been widely used to monitor subsurface parameters that indirectly influence slope stability (e.g., Bichler et al., 2004; Agnesi et al., 2005; Bruckl et al., 2006; Hibert et al., 2012; Springman et al., 2013; Merritt et al., 2014; Uhlemann et al., 2016; Whiteley et al., 2019). However, whilst there have been some studies focussed on monitoring slopes which affect transport infrastructure using geophysics (e.g., Proto et al., 2010; Donohue et al., 2011; Chambers et al., 2014; Bergamo et al., 2016a, 2016b; Gunn et al., 2018; Holmes et al., 2020; Holmes et al., 2022), this body of research is comparatively small, although it is rapidly expanding.\nElectrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) can be used to monitor earthworks structures and is particularly useful in this context as electrical resistivity is sensitive to spatial variations in lithology so complex subsurface structures of heterogeneous earthworks slopes can be assessed. Additionally, electrical resistivity varies according to moisture content (Waxman and Smits, 1968) and, by extension, soil suction (a factor important in the assessment of slope stability), resistivity of the pore fluid (Archie, 1942), and temperature (Hayley et al., 2007), so changes in these parameters can also be assessed through time and space.\nHere, we investigate the use of long-term near-real-time geophysical monitoring of an unstable railway cutting in Old Dalby, Leicestershire, United Kingdom. An ERT monitoring system, PRIME (Proactive Infrastructure Monitoring and Evaluation) (Holmes et al., 2020), is used to provide insight into the changing hydrogeological conditions of the slope with seasonal changes in weather conditions. Petrophysical relationships between electrical resistivity, moisture content, and soil suction were developed in the laboratory and applied to the electrical resistivity models produced from the PRIME monitoring, with the aim of providing direct insights into changes in these parameters through time and space. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the influence of different types of vegetation on subsurface changes in moisture content and soil suction \u2013 two factors important in governing the stability of transport infrastructure \u2013 through the long-term monitoring of a grassed area and a wooded area of a railway cutting.\n\n\n2\nStudy area \u2013 the Old Dalby railway test track\nThe Old Dalby test track is a railway track in Leicestershire, United Kingdom (Fig. 1\n), which closed to passenger trains in 1967 and to goods trains in 1968. It is now used for the testing of new train designs (Clark, 2004). The Old Dalby Railway test track includes sections of cut slopes, which have a history of instability. The studied section of the Old Dalby railway cutting was selected for this research owing to its history of instability \u2013 the grassed area in the centre of the slope is the site of a relict landslide. On either side of this landslide, the railway cutting is wooded, with broadleaf deciduous trees, predominantly Hawthorne. This spatial variation in vegetation cover enabled a comparison of the influence of vegetation type on subsurface resistivity.\nThe study site is located in a temperate climatic zone, and weather patterns vary seasonally. Summers tend to be warm and dry, and winters are cold and wet. The average annual temperature in Leicestershire, where the Old Dalby railway cutting is located, is 9.9\u00a0\u00b0C, with the highest and lowest monthly average temperatures of 16.7\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.2\u00a0\u00b0C in July and January respectively (Climate-Data.org, 2022). Average precipitation is 707\u00a0mm per year (ibid.).\nA borehole core was taken from the top of the slope of the Old Dalby railway cutting, the location of which is shown in Fig. 2\n. The core taken provides lithostratigraphic information on the upper 6.83\u00a0m of the Old Dalby cutting. Percussion drilling was used to obtain the core, using a 102\u00a0mm barrel with 1\u00a0m of casing. At 4\u00a0m depth, the barrel size was reduced to 87\u00a0mm to aid progression. Non-contact resistivity imaging was used to log the core, without disturbing the material (Jackson et al., 2006). This meant that core material could also be used to develop petrophysical relationships, as described later in this paper. To make the measurements, the core was placed on a table over a transmitter coil that produced a primary magnetic field that induced electric currents in the sample. The induced currents produce a secondary magnetic field that is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the core. Resistivity was also measured using galvanic current, by inserting potential electrodes along the length of the core and introducing current at each end of the core. Similar results were obtained from both measurement methods, indicating the validity of the results. Material taken from the core was also used to establish the particle size distribution of the material from the Old Dalby cutting.\nThe borehole core taken from the Old Dalby site demonstrates the main geology at the site. Fig. 3\n shows the core alongside the resistivity logs. The lowermost unit identified in this core, which ranges from 6.0 to 6.83\u00a0m below the surface, is identified as the Blue Anchor Formation, and has a lower resistivity than the upper 6.0\u00a0m of the core. The Blue Anchor Formation is composed of pale green-grey siltstone and mudstone and was deposited in mixed continental and marine waters (Ambrose, 1998).\nOverlying the Blue Anchor formation in parts of the site is the Westbury Formation, which formed as part of the Penarth Group during a marine transgression (Ambrose, 1998; Carney et al., 2004), and is comprised of fissile mudstones and thin sandstone. However, this formation is poorly exposed as it is highly susceptible to weathering (Carney et al., 2004). The material comprising the Old Dalby railway cutting and represented in the core is a Quaternary glacial till called the Thrussington Till, from approximately 0.7 to 6.0\u00a0m depth. The Thrussington Till is comprised of a stiff fine-grained, red-brown matrix with occasion gravel inclusions (derived from local Penarth and Mercia rocks). Topsoil makes up the uppermost 0.7\u00a0m of the core.\nA 3-D ground model was developed for the Old Dalby railway cutting using borehole data from the top of the PRIME-monitored section of the slope, along with the ERT images produced from the PRIME ERT data, and a Digital Elevation Model of the site. ERT models were imported into Paraview, a data analysis and visualisation application (Ayachit, 2015), and lithological boundaries were identified in the borehole logs from the site. This information, alongside previous geological interpretations from geology maps of the site was used to inform the location of the lithological boundaries across the PRIME-monitored area of the site. One boundary was identified - between Blue Anchor Till and the overlying Thrussington Till \u2013 and this boundary was digitized on the model in 3-D. This enabled the visualisation of geological cross-sections along each array line of the ERT model and allowed for the calibration of the model with petrophysical relationships relevant to the specific material properties present in each zone of the slope.\n\nFig. 4\n shows a simple 3-Dimensional ground model of the Old Dalby railway cutting. This reveals horizontal bedding at the site, with Thrussington Till comprising the upper part of the slope, and overlying Blue Anchor Till at the toe of the slope. This ground model was used to determine which of the petrophysical relationships developed in the lab for each material should be used for the calibration of each region of the model. It should be noted here that this simple ground model is based on a single borehole, and then better-defined using resistivity models. As such, there may be variation within the geological setting of the Old Dalby railway cutting that is not captured by this model, which highlights a limitation of the research.\nThe particle size distribution tests of the Thrussington Till and the Blue Anchor Formation indicate both formations to be a sandy clay (Table 1\n).\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nTime-lapse ERT monitoring\nA near-real-time ERT monitoring system, PRIME (Proactive Infrastructure Monitoring and Evaluation) (Holmes et al., 2020) installed on the Old Dalby railway cutting actively collected data for two years (July 2015 to July 2017). The PRIME installation consisted of multiple electrode arrays connected to the PRIME system, which made electrical resistivity measurements at 12-h intervals and sent the data to a remote server via an internet connection, allowing the site to be repeatedly monitored to develop a 4-D ERT dataset. Buried, stainless steel, rod electrodes were set out in 5 lines, 2 running across slope, and 3 running down slope, as shown in Fig. 2, extending across a relict landslide and sections of un-slipped cutting either side. Lines 1 and 2 consisted of 91 electrodes at 1\u00a0m spacing, and Lines 3, 4, and 5 consisted of 19 electrodes at 1\u00a0m spacing. The system was powered using a 100\u00a0W solar panel, making it independent from mains power supply.\nUse of the PRIME system here allowed for automated remote data collection, which eliminated the need for repeat manual ERT surveys. This is an important consideration for transport infrastructure assets as active railway lines are hazardous environments. Additionally, the temporal resolution offered by the twice-daily measurement scheme implemented here allows a detailed interpretation of subsurface changes in electrical resistivity in response to changing soil moisture conditions through time and space. As the ERT arrays extend across both wooded and grassed areas of the slope (Fig. 2), an assessment of the importance of vegetation cover on soil moisture dynamics could also be considered.\nResistivity data was filtered to remove any poor-quality measurements; data with high contact resistances (>1 k\u03a9) or negative transfer resistances were removed from the dataset. Reciprocal errors were calculated using the forward and reciprocal measurements taken by the PRIME system to produce error models for each dataset in the time-lapse inversion (Lesparre et al., 2017). Any measurements with high reciprocal errors (>5%) were filtered out of the dataset to improve the fit of the data to the model during geophysical inversion (Tso et al., 2017).\nThe resistivity data were inverted using an iteratively reweighted Gauss-Newton least-squared method in Res3DInvx64 from Geotomo Software (Loke et al., 2003; Loke, 2017). To avoid overfitting, the inversion process was stopped once the reduction in absolute misfit between subsequent iterations was <5%. The inversion constraints were selected to ensure the most accurate model possible was obtained: an L2-norm spatial smoothness constraint was selected to provide spatial smoothing. Smoothing was stronger in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction (2:1), as the predominant change in resistivity occurs parallel to the slope surface (i.e., wetting and drying of the near-surface). Additionally, for each ERT line (Fig. 2), all of the data from each individual time step were combined into a single file and inverted simultaneously using an L1-norm temporal smoothness constraint. Data for each line was inverted in 3-D to account for offline variations in topography and to allow for some resistivity variation in the direction perpendicular to the line (Holmes et al., 2020). The perpendicular extent of the model was half the vertical extent and the discretisation in the off-line direction was twice as coarse, promoting more vertical variation of resistivity while allowing for a degree of off-line variation. The fact that the resistivity of a large volume of the subsurface is modelled using a grid of 5 electrode arrays is a potential limitation of the method, owing to the uncertainty associated with resistivity values for regions of the model that are far from the location of the electrode arrays. As such,the resulting models are displayed using only the cells directly below the electrode lines to display the vertical model variation clearly.\n\n\n3.2\nDevelopment of laboratory-based petrophysical relationships\nThe relationship between electrical resistivity and soil moisture content can be described by petrophysical models such as Waxman and Smits (1968), and Archie's Law (Archie, 1942). Given that moisture content is a key control on slope stability, an understanding of the relationship between moisture content and electrical resistivity is imperative for drawing interpretations from the PRIME models. Soil suction also has a close relationship with soil moisture content. As such, indirect relationships can also be established between soil suction and electrical resistivity (e.g., Merritt et al., 2016; Holmes et al., 2020). Here, relationships between electrical resistivity, moisture content, and soil suction were developed in the laboratory such that the PRIME model images can be discussed in terms of changes in moisture content and soil suction.\n\n3.2.1\nSoil matric suction measurements\nHere, a Water Potential Meter WP4C (Meter Group) was used to measure matric suction (MPa) to 1% accuracy between \u22125 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a0300\u00a0MPa. Samples (5\u00a0mm depth, 37\u00a0mm diameter) were cut out following compaction of material taken from Old Dalby at maximum dry density (12.5% moisture content by weight) in a Proctor mould using British Standard methodology (BS1377\u20134), as in-situ density information was not available due to limited site access. Samples were allowed to dry for set amounts of time (30\u00a0min to 2\u00a0h) so that suction measurements could be carried out at different moisture contents. During wetting cycles, distilled water was added to the samples using a pipette, and the samples were left to equilibrate for at least 2\u00a0h before suction was measured.\n\n\n3.2.2\nElectrical resistivity measurements\nElectrical resistivity was also measured in the laboratory at different moisture contents to establish a relationship between resistivity and soil moisture. For the Thrussington Till, this was completed using coffin tests.\nFirstly, a Proctor sample was produced at maximum dry density using British Standard methodology. Samples (25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0\u00d7\u00a075\u00a0mm) were placed in perforated plastic coffins (Fig. 5\n) for resistivity measurements. Each coffin had a current electrode at either end of the sample, and two potential electrodes in the middle of the sample, spaced 25\u00a0mm apart. Resistivity coffin samples were taken from the Proctor mould both horizontally and vertically to determine the effect of anisotropy on resistivity measurements. Measurements were taken at different moisture contents over several wetting and drying cycles.\nA function generator with a frequency of 60-Hz was used, and the current was altered throughout the wetting and drying cycles (ranging between 537 and 5664\u00a0\u03bcA). The injection current was measured across a 20\u00a0\u03a9 resistor. The resulting voltage was measured across the two potential electrodes using an oscilloscope.\nFirstly, the geometric factor of the sample was calculated:\n\n(1)\n\nG\n=\n\n\u2205\n\n1000\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere G is the geometric factor, \u2205 is the cross-sectional area of the sample (mm2), and X is the electrode separation of the potential electrodes (mm).\nThe oscilloscope readings, along with the known current were then used to calculate the resistance of the sample:\n\n(2)\n\n\nR\nsoil\n\n=\n\n\nV\nsoil\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere R\nsoil is the resistance of the sample (\u03a9), V\nsoil is the voltage across the sample (V) (half the peak to peak voltage measured on the oscilloscope), and I is the applied current (A).\nThis was then used to calculate the resistivity of the sample, \u03c1\nsoil (\u03a9m):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03c1\nsoil\n\n=\n\nR\nsoil\n\nG\n\n\n\n\nGiven that temperature has a considerable influence on geoelectrical measurements, with conductivity increasing linearly with temperature above 0\u00a0\u00b0C (Hayley et al., 2007), the temperature of the room was also recorded during each measurement, which allowed to correct the resistivity for variations in sample temperature:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c1\nT\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\nsoil\n\n\n\n1\n+\n0.02\n\n\nT\n\u2212\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03c1\nT is temperature-corrected resistivity (\u03a9m), and T is temperature (\u00b0C). Temperature correction was made to 25\u00a0\u00b0C to enable comparison with other methodologies used here which use an ES-2 sensor where measurements are automatically corrected to 25\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n3.2.3\nModified HYPROP2 experiments\nHere, a novel methodology for the simultaneous measurement of soil suction and electrical resistivity provides the opportunity to develop direct relationships between suction, resistivity and moisture content (Holmes et al., 2022) for the Blue Anchor Formation from the Old Dalby Railway Cutting. Samples were reconstituted and compacted using British Standard methodology to in-situ dry density. Experiments were attempted for the Thrussington Till, but compaction of the sample resulted in pore water pressure building up at compaction boundaries, making saturation impossible.\nModification of HYPROP 2 equipment (Meter Group) enabled a four-point resistivity array to be inserted into the sample to allow for simultaneous measurements of suction, moisture content, and resistivity, and provided direct relationships between these parameters (See Holmes et al., 2022 for methodological details).\n\n\n3.2.4\nCalibration of ERT models\nA modified Waxman-Smits model was fitted to the resistivity and moisture content data measured in the laboratory, as in Uhlemann et al.

The average cation mobility, B\n\nws\n (S cm3 m\u22121\u00a0meq\u22121), was estimated from the empirical fit given by Waxman and Smits (1968). Each parameter was measured in the laboratory, with the exception of F and n, which were fitted (there is uncertainty in these values as although these values fit the data, they are not unique) and B\n\nws\n, which was estimated (Waxman and Smits, 1968):\n\n(6)\n\n(\n\nB\nws\n\n=\n4.6\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n0.06\n\nExp\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\nw\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaxman-Smits models were fitted to the data from each lithological unit tested in the laboratory in order to convert electrical resistivity to gravimetric moisture content. The resulting models were used for the calibration of the ERT models generated from data from the PRIME system. The parameters used in this calculation for each lithological unit are shown in Table 2\n.\nFurther utilising the direct relationship between electrical resistivity, moisture content, and matric suction, a relationship between resistivity and soil suction can be established.\n\nFredlund and Xing (1994) present an equation that relates soil water content (\u03b8) with soil suction (\u03c8):\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b8\n=\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nln\n\n\ne\n+\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\/\na\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b8\ns is water content at saturation, and a, t, and b are fitting parameters, and e is Euler's number.

Here, this calibration is only made for the Thrussington Till, as this allowed for comparison with soil sensors installed at the site of the Old Dalby railway cutting, located in the Thrussington Till unit. The parameters used in eq. 9 for this calibration are shown in Table 3\n.\n\n\n\n3.3\nField sensor measurements\nIn addition to the PRIME system at the Old Dalby site, other field sensors were installed to provide further monitoring data to inform interpretations from the PRIME ERT models. An ECRN-100 Rain Gauge (METER Group) was installed at the top of the slope on Line 4 (central line) of the PRIME system. This provided rainfall data for the duration of the PRIME monitoring period. In addition to this, GS3 and 5TE sensors, which monitor soil moisture content, electrical conductivity, and temperature, were installed at 0.15\u00a0m depth in the Thrussington Till and at 2.6\u00a0m depth in the Blue Anchor, respectively.\nEffective rainfall \u2013 total rainfall minus evapotranspiration \u2013 was calculated, using the rainfall data from the ECRN-100 rain gauge. Here, evapotranspiration was calculated using the Hargreaves-Samani equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; Samani, 2000), which uses temperature (measured on site), and a latitude-based radiation approximation to estimate evapotranspiration:\n\n(11)\n\nET\n=\n0.0135\n\nKT\n\n\n\nR\na\n\n\n\n\nTD\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\nTC\n+\n17.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere ET is evapotranspiration, KT is an empirical coefficient, R\n\na\n is extra-terrestrial radiation, TD is temperature difference between the maximum and minimum recorded temperature (\u00b0C) (T\nmax \u2013 T\nmin), and TC is the average daily air temperature (\u00b0C).\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\n\n4.1\nPetrophysical relationships\nResults of the electrical resistivity-moisture content relationship experiments are shown in Fig. 6\n for both the Thrussington Till and the Blue Anchor units, and the Waxman-Smits model fitted to each dataset is displayed. There is a clear relationship between electrical resistivity and gravimetric moisture content, with a non-linear decrease in electrical resistivity as soil moisture increases. In the coffin tests, the effect of anisotropy on the resistivity measurements is clear \u2013 there is a distinction between measurements made on the vertically cut and horizontally cut coffin samples, where at lower moisture contents, the resistivity of the coffins with vertically cut samples was higher than that of the horizontally cut samples. This phenomenon is observed in the literature: Merritt et al. (2016) stated that in material with high silt and clay contents, measurements taken perpendicular to the bedding planes (vertical coffin tests here) show higher values of resistivity than measurements taken parallel to the bedding planes (horizontal coffin tests here). This shows a clear anisotropy in the measurements owing to preferential current flow along bedding planes (Merritt et al., 2016) and highlights a source of potential error and uncertainty in making interpretations of moisture content based on electrical resistivity. Here, an average of the vertical and horizontal measurements was taken and used for the development of a Waxman-Smits relationship for calibration of the field ERT models.\nThese relationships were used for the calibration of the ERT models to provide a direct interpretation of the changes in moisture content and soil suction through space and time, as opposed to inferring moisture content changes from changes in resistivity.\n\nFig. 7\n shows the relationship between soil suction (negative pore water pressure) and moisture content for the Thrussington Till. Again, there is a non-linear relationship between these two parameters; suction increases exponentially with decreasing moisture content, and the correlation within each wetting and drying cycle has an R2 value of over 0.95 in all cases. As soil suction is clearly related to moisture content, and resistivity is also closely correlated to moisture content, it is also possible to infer changes in matric suction from changes in electrical resistivity.\n\n\n4.2\n4-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography\nA temperature-corrected baseline ERT image from the PRIME monitoring (05\/05\/2016) at the Old Dalby test track is shown in Fig. 8\n. The wooded areas of the slope captured by the monitoring on Line 3 and Line 5, and the areas of Lines 1 and 2 that intercept them, exhibit higher baseline values of electrical resistivity. Line 4, and the areas of Lines 1 and 2 that it intercepts, have lower baseline values of resistivity, and are grassed. This contrast in resistivity is due to the impact of soil moisture variations, as wooded areas of the slope are dryer than grassed areas due to root uptake of soil moisture during the summer months. Also present in Line 1 is a counterfort drain, shown by a high resistivity zone surrounded by a lower resistivity zone caused by preferential movement of groundwater in the soil in this area. This image was selected as the baseline as it is midway between the maximum resistivity values in summer and the minimum resistivity values in winter.\nThe ERT models were calibrated using the laboratory-developed petrophysical relationships shown in Fig. 6, with different relationships applied to different zones of the model according to the 3-D ground model (Fig. 4). Fig. 9\n shows the baseline image of the ERT models (Fig. 8) converted to show the spatial distribution of gravimetric moisture content (GMC). Fig. 10\n shows the percentage change in GMC through time and space, showing percentage change from this calibrated baseline image. Positive changes in GMC are indicative of wetting, and negative changes in GMC are indicative of drying. Two years of PRIME monitoring data from Old Dalby are presented in Fig. 10. Changes in GMC over this period are shown through bimonthly snapshots of the Old Dalby railway cutting from July 2015 to June 2017.\n\nFig. 10 shows a clear preferential wetting at the toe of the Old Dalby railway cutting, characterised here by an increase in GMC from the spring baseline. This occurs in the region of the counterfort drain, identified in Fig. 8. The increase in moisture content observed here has implications for soil suction (negative pore water pressure), which is important for slope stability as if soil suction is decreased sufficiently it can induce slope failure (Fredlund et al., 1978). Indeed, tension cracks are observed at the surface in this region, indicating early signs of instability.\nMost notably at the site of the Old Dalby railway cutting, the changes in resistivity, and therefore in soil moisture content, are exacerbated by the presence of vegetation, as shown by the spatial disparities in resistivity in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10. The wooded regions of the slope (predominantly on Lines 3 and 5 (Fig. 2)) undergo much greater changes in resistivity (and, therefore, in GMC) seasonally than the grassed regions. The wooded areas of the slope have a low resistivity during winter months and high resistivity during summer months, with an average high resistivity of 50.9\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0m in summer, and an average low resistivity of 26.0\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0m in winter. Conversely, the grassed area of the slope (around Line 4 (Fig. 2)) undergoes little change between summer and winter, with a small resistivity range of 20.4\u201325.3\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0m across the monitoring period.\nThis effect is also clear in Fig. 11\n, which shows GMC (converted from resistivity) through time for wooded and grassed regions of the monitored volume of the slope. To differentiate between wooded and grassed areas of the model, a mask was applied to the model data that isolated the cells of the model in the wooded and grassed zones respectively, and then the average GMC of these cells was calculated for each time step in the model. The average GMC is shown for the entire depth of the ERT models. Effective rainfall data is also shown alongside this, such that interpretations of changes in resistivity in response to soil moisture variation can be informed by knowledge of weather conditions.\nData from the moisture content sensors (GS3 and 5TE) installed on the slope are also shown in Fig. 11. In summer months, high values of electrical resistivity in wooded areas correspond to low volumetric moisture content during periods of negative effective rainfall, as evidenced by field sensor data (Fig. 11). In winter, lower values of electrical resistivity in the wooded areas of the slope correspond to higher volumetric moisture content in the subsurface, which occurs in response to positive effective rainfall. The changes in moisture content at 0.15\u00a0m below the surface correspond closely to the changes in rainfall over short time-periods, but the moisture content at 2.6\u00a0m depth relates to seasonal changes in soil moisture content. Indeed, the moisture content rises sharply at 2.6\u00a0m depth following prolonged rainfall in winter, coinciding with reduced resistivity in the subsurface and falls during dry periods when effective rainfall is negative during the summer, coinciding with an increase in average resistivity in the subsurface (Fig. 10).\nHowever, the seasonal changes in resistivity observed in the wooded areas are not seen in the grassed areas of the slope (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11). The role of vegetation in controlling spatial distributions of soil moisture is greater during the summer due to increased plant activity as a result of higher air temperatures and longer daylight hours, causing higher rates of photosynthesis, plant growth, transpiration, and root water uptake (Rodr\u00edguez-Iturbe and Porporato, 2004; Vivoni et al., 2008). In winter, plant activity is reduced, which explains the reduction in the difference in resistivity between wooded and grassed areas during this time. Additionally, tree-covered ground is likely to be drier in summer due to interception of rainfall and the canopy storage function of broadleaf species, and the difference between the moisture content of the wooded and grassed areas is diminished during winter owing to leaf loss.\nThe disparity in the extent to which changes in soil moisture content are exacerbated by plant activity is strongly dependent on the type of vegetation: Grass has a longer growing season than trees, particularly during early spring, prior to the emergence of leaves on broadleaf trees (Harding et al., 1992). This effect can be seen in Fig. 10 where there is an increase in GMC across the wooded area in response to positive effective rainfall in the image from 03\/03\/2017 and 24\/03\/2017, but very little change in the grassed area owing to root uptake of water. Therefore, there is a spatial disparity in seasonal responses to changing weather conditions owing to the vegetation type.\nOwing to the associated controls on soil moisture, as is indicated by the changes in electrical resistivity observed here, the type of vegetation cover on slopes is an important consideration for the assessment of the integrity and stability of transport infrastructure assets. In wooded areas, the GMC ranged between 0.095 and 0.130\u00a0g\/g, whereas for grass, the range was much narrower, ranging between 0.124 and 0.138\u00a0g\/g. While the presence of roots can increase slope stability due to increased cohesion, repeated wetting and drying cycles can result in volumetric deformation with shrink-swell behaviour, and a reduction in shear strength (Khan et al., 2019). Previous studies report similar findings: for example, vertical displacement of a railway embankment comprising London Clay fill was an order of magnitude greater adjacent to a tree-covered area, when compared with a grass-covered area (Scott, 2006). Indeed, near to the Old Dalby PRIME installation, surface signs of slope instability are observed in the wooded zone, with tension cracks appearing. This highlights the need to consider vegetation in the assessment of slope stability on the transport network. Due to the shrink-swell behaviour associated with trees and the high levels of soil moisture associated with grasses, a combination of vegetation types is suggested.\nWhile the presence of trees can increase slope stability due to increased cohesion and reduced surface erosion from roots, it is also noted that in sites where the slip plane of the landslide occurs below the root level, additional weight from trees can increase displacement (Ziemer, 1981). As such, where slopes are already unstable, unlike the Old Dalby railway cutting, tree felling is recommended to mitigate this effect. However, in clay soils removal of trees can result in a temporary increase in suction, leading to softening as a result of moisture migration to the felled area (Greenwood et al., 2004). As such, careful consideration of the geological setting of an embankment or cutting must be made in order for mitigation of slope instability to be effective.\nChanges in soil suction through time at the Old Dalby Railway Cutting are shown in Fig. 12\n. The resistivity of the cells in the ERT models proximal to the location of moisture content sensors in the field was averaged for each time step, and the models shown in Fig. 7 were applied to provide changes in suction through time. Field measurements of GMC are shown alongside this. As expected, as GMC increased, soil suction decreased, as there is a monotonic relationship between moisture content and soil suction. Soil suction is lowest during the winter when plant activity is at a minimum, and gradually increases in line with the seasonal decrease in GMC due to evapotranspiration and increased root uptake of soil moisture in the summer months and associated drying of the slope in the wooded areas. This data further highlights the cyclic changes in subsurface conditions that are known to induce shrink-swell related deterioration of slope material, eventually leading weakening and failure.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe subsurface response to seasonal changes in weather conditions at the Old Dalby railway cutting has been assessed through 4-D ground imaging using a PRIME (Proactive Infrastructure Monitoring and Evaluation) system installed at the site. 4-D geoelectrical monitoring at Old Dalby reveals a clear hydrogeological regime that responds closely to changes in surface weather conditions on a seasonal basis, with surface drying during summer months, and wetting of the subsurface during winter months. Most notable here is the spatial disparity in the seasonal response to changing weather conditions. The resistivity of the grassed area of the slope was not observed to change significantly over time, whereas the resistivity of wooded areas was much higher in summer than in winter, responding more closely to changes in effective rainfall. This is due to greater plant activity during summer (transpiration, root water uptake, accelerated growth, and photosynthesis), which results in greater drying at the surface of wooded zones compared to grassed zones. This highlights the utility of geoelectrical monitoring for monitoring transport infrastructure slopes, as it provides insight into moisture pathways and spatial heterogeneities that cannot be identified using traditional asset monitoring techniques. Therefore, given that many asset stability issues are related to high moisture content, ERT is a useful tool in asset monitoring as it provides an effective means of imaging drainage processes. Additionally, the need to consider vegetation in the assessment of slope stability on the transport network has been highlighted: while trees can improve cohesion of soils on transport infrastructure assets, the increased seasonal changes in moisture content owing to the presence of trees can increase shrink-swell behaviour, leading to slope destabilisation. As such, trees are not recommended for planting on slopes comprised of expansive soils proximal to transport infrastructure. This study shows that non-invasive, automated, remote ERT monitoring can be an effective tool in imaging such processes, highlighting its use as a monitoring tool for infrastructure assets.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJessica Holmes: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization, Formal analysis.

For this reason, the expansion of road networks is a priority for many LIC\/LMICs governments such as Nepal (Sudmeier-Rieux et al., 2019) and Ethiopia (Hearn, 2018). Despite the significant allocation of government and donor agency spending on road building, roads still experience frequent disruptions due to cutting instabilities, especially in countries that host steep landscapes and that experience prolonged or intense rainfall (Hearn and Shakya, 2017). We believe one of the reasons that instabilities remain common is a lack of user-friendly but technically sound guidelines for the practitioners who design roadside cuttings (Robson et al., 2021).\nDesigning a roadside cutting is a trade off between the desired safety margin against failure and the cost of excavation. Determining how steep a cutting can be, requires a stability analysis. In higher income countries where larger road budgets exist, stability analyses are often conducted for each individual cutting and involves: detailed and expensive site investigation to determine geotechnical parameters; and numerical simulations by methods that can include Limit Equilibrium Methods (LEM), Finite Difference, Finite Element (FE), Discrete Element. Geotechnical engineers use stability charts as a guide for preliminary design. In current stability charts the ground strength is characterised in terms of either the Generalised Hoek-Brown (G-H-B) (Li et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2013) or the Mohr-Coulomb (M-C) failure criterion (Taylor, 1937; Chen et al., 1969; Wyllie and Mah, 2004; Michalowski, 2002; Utili, 2013; Wyllie, 2017). Intact rocks and jointed rock masses are best described by the G-H-B failure criterion, whereas highly weathered rocks, residual and alluvial soils are best described by the M-C criterion (Hoek and Brown, 2019).\nWhen road construction is funded internally in LIC\/LMICs, conducting individual slope stability analyses for every road cutting is not common practice, especially on local roads, due to a lack of time and budget. Even the cheaper and simpler approach of consulting published stability charts is not used in many cases as these charts are not user-friendly. Practitioners who lack a thorough understanding of geotechnical engineering may struggle to use charts that call for exact ground strength parameter values and do not offer guidance on how to determine these.\nTherefore, where only visual observation is possible (rather than geotechnical investigation) many practitioners design roadside cuttings based on guidelines for cutting inclinations outlined in government and donor agency manuals - e.g. the Philippines: Department of Public Works and Highways (2007); Malaysia: Slope Engineering Branch (2010); Nepal: Department of Roads (2013); Liberia: Ministry of Public Works (2020) - that do not require exact parameter values allowing practitioners to estimate these on the basis of previous experience. These guidelines vary greatly in detail, usability and rigor. They often do not account for important characteristics of the cuttings such as: hardness of the geomaterial, rock weathering, seepage or weakening induced by excavation. Guidelines can lack a suitable description of rock or soil types, meaning that they are difficult to use without detailed knowledge of rock properties. Guidelines can be generic, not taking into account the soil\/rock type found in a specific location. This could lead to inaccuracies if observed rock types cannot be categorised according to the guidelines. In addition, some manuals containing guidelines present multiple tables in different formats making them difficult to understand and many lack a description of how guidelines were developed making them prone to inaccurate use. Some examples of manuals presenting the aforementioned pitfalls are described below.\nThe Manual for Low Volume Roads published by the Republic of Liberia (Ministry of Public Works, 2020) presents a table of recommendations for \u2018cut angles for rock, residual soil and transported soil\u2019 (p. 91) that is taken from Hearn (2011) based on data derived from a range of road construction and improvement projects in Southeast Asia. This table is presented alongside a table for weathering grade classifications and photographs of examples for cuttings made up of residual soil and colluvium. \u00a0The text surrounding the table warns the engineer about adverse jointing and that variations will be required to account for site-specific material and drainage conditions. Although this guidance is suitable for training, it may be difficult for practitioners to use in the field as the information is presented in various formats.\nThe Guide to Slope Protection works for the Philippines published by Department of Public Works and Highways (2007) presents a table outlining standard inclinations for cuttings that is modified from the Japan Roads Association (1999). They categorise geomaterials in terms of hardness and soil type, providing descriptions for the soil types and outlining the cutting heights for which the inclinations are valid. Little is mentioned on the method employed to derive the guidelines and, therefore, little confidence can be placed on them.\nThe Roadside Geotechnical Problems manual published by the Government of Nepal (Department of Roads, 2007) presents eight separate tables, from various sources, for cutting inclinations based on different rock characteristics. Although these tables cover discontinuities in the rock, weathering and gravel types, none of the tables include the excavation history, nor do they offer user inputs in terms of the required margin of safety in the design (i.e. Factor of Safety [FoS]). In addition, they don't include details on how the tables were developed and key information about what cuttings they are applicable to. For example, the original source of Table C3.6 (p. 12) in Department of Roads (2007) is Hearn (2011). Hearn (2011) specify that this table is developed for cut slopes of up to 10\u00a0m in height with dry slope conditions and to achieve a FoS of 1, but this information is missing from Department of Roads (2007).\nThe stability table for cuttings presented in Ethiopian Roads Authority (2016) (p. 5\u201359) is based on that developed by Hearn and Pettifer (2016). Hearn and Pettifer (2016) conducted field observations of post-construction earthworks along a road in the Blue Nile basin, a geographical region in Ethiopia. These observations were reviewed alongside the recommended cutting inclinations for the road project. Hearn and Pettifer (2016) develop their recommendations by comparing their review of observations against a set of recommendations on cutting geometries developed by Ayalew et al. (2009). Ayalew et al. (2009) presented guidelines as ratios of cutting lengths to cutting heights, from which one can infer the cutting inclinations. These were developed based on the long-term inspection of the performance of natural and cutting along a road in the Blue Nile basin. Although the guidelines presented by Hearn and Pettifer (2016) and Ayalew et al. (2009) are reliable and thorough, they both required lengthy field observations for their development.\nEngineering geomorphology approaches seek to use observations about landscape form and inferences about slope processes over a range of time and space scales to organise observations and guide further analysis (Hearn, 2011; Hearn and Hart, 2011; Griffiths, 2016). The approaches can be particularly valuable in identifying the dominant drivers of instability (e.g. structural control), but do not offer guidance on next steps for analysis or action. Engineering geomorphology cannot replace guidelines, which indeed continue to play an important role (e.g. Table C2.5, p153 of Hearn (2011)). These approaches are applicable in many contexts but perhaps particularly so in LIC and LMICs where there are limited funds for geotechnical investigation and stability analysis (Baynes and Lee, 1998). Practical guides, such as Brunsden et al. (1975); Lawrence and Hearn (1997); Hearn (2011), offer practitioners an alternative approach to determine the most appropriate cutting stabilisation method. However, the guidelines and charts still suffer some of the limitations identified above.\nWe present two key contributions in this paper: (1) a new methodology to develop stability guidelines for road cutting inclinations (outlined in Section 2); and (2) a set of road cutting guidelines developed for Nepal using this methodology (Section 3.1). We also employ the methodology to develop a smaller set of guidelines for Ethiopia. As Ethiopia and Nepal exhibit different geologies, this showcases that the proposed methodology can be adopted by a geotechnical engineer to develop guidelines for any specific locality.\nThe guidelines are designed so they can be used in the field by any practitioner to determine a cutting inclination based on field observations. They are applicable to either intact or heavily jointed rock mass, but not cuttings that exhibit dominant structural orientation. The guidelines produced by the methodology here introduced should be used for road cutting design where only visual observation is possible or as a tool to assess the stability of an existing cutting. If data from in situ geotechnical investigation and slope stability software are available, it is recommended numerical slope stability analyses are performed to produce a more accurate design of the cutting.\nThe guidelines are developed using appropriate failure criteria (i.e. G-H-B for rock, M-C for soil) with a rigorous LEM stability analysis method, i.e. Morgenstern-Price (M-P). The methodology includes details on how to create guidelines for an inclined upslope boundary (typical of real cuttings) and the inclusion of seepage, which are demonstrated in the produced Nepal guidelines. Then, in Section 4.1.1 the consistency of the rigor of the guidelines developed for Nepal is tested against other published stability charts. In Section 4.1.2 case studies are employed to test guideline usability in comparison with both existing guidelines and published stability charts. Finally uncertainty and adaptability of the produced guidelines are assessed in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3 respectively.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nIn this section of the paper we outline a general methodology that can be used to develop road cutting inclination guidelines for any location. The guidelines are presented as tables that display recommended cutting inclinations within rock groups. Common rock and soil types for the area of interest are assigned to these groups based on their strength characterised according to G-H-B and M-C failure criterion. G-H-B is used in the majority of cases, whereas M-C is used for soils. The resulting guidelines present the G-H-B parameters of disturbance caused by excavation (D), the structure and weathering state of the rock mass (Geological Strength Index, GSI), and the strength of the rock (Uniaxial compressive strength, UCS) as user inputs, alongside descriptions on how to estimate these in the field. The rock groups are classified according to UCS as this parameter plays a dominant role in defining rock strength (Hoek and Brown, 2019). Multiple options are given as user-inputs in the guidelines for GSI and D, as the FoS is highly sensitive to these parameters (V\u00e1n et al., 2013). The remaining parameters that are more difficult to estimate in the field, unit weight (\u03b3) and material constant for intact rock (m\n\ni\n), are built into the table so they do not need to be defined by the user. Cutting heights and FoS values are also given as user-inputs in the guidelines. Cutting inclinations are determined by conducting numerical slope stability analyses for a combination of parameters assigned to each group, to achieve a desired FoS. An overview of this methodology is given in Appendix A.1.\n\n2.1\nGeneralised Hoek-Brown criterion\nThe common rock types in the area of interest are placed in groups based on the UCS classification for hardness of Brown (1981), that includes seven groups ranging from \u2018Extremely weak\u2019 to \u2018Extremely hard\u2019. Each group captures a discrete range of UCS values. Some rock types may fall into more than one group. Table 1 in Marinos and Hoek (2000) can be used as a guideline to identify the appropriate group for the rock types according to field estimates of their UCS values. A literature search should be conducted on UCS values of rocks in the area of interest to corroborate the Marinos and Hoek (2000) classifications. Marinos and Hoek (2000) also outline simple field tests to identify the UCS of rocks in the field. These should be included in the resulting guidelines to aid practitioners in determining the correct group.\nValues of m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 are identified for common rock types in each rock group. Marinos and Hoek (2000) can be used as guidance for values of m\n\ni\n for different rock types, whilst Fine (2021) can be used for guidance on \u03b3 values. Again, these values should be corroborated or otherwise amended according to literature searches for m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 values in the area of interest where possible.\nEach rock group has then got a discrete range for UCS, multiple values of \u03b3, and multiple values of m\n\ni\n assigned to it. To keep the guidelines concise and for the benefit of numerical analyses, a single value for each of these parameters should be assigned to the group. For UCS, the midpoint of their ranges can be used. The single value for m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 can be taken as the mean of the values for the rocks in that group to capture their central tendency.\nGSI describes the structure and surface conditions of a rock mass, hence it can be determined by field observations. GSI values range from around 10 for poor, weathered rock masses to 100 for intact rock masses (Marinos and Hoek, 2000). Each rock type exhibits a typical range of GSI values. To represent the spread of possible GSI values whilst keeping the guidelines simple, we established a low (L), intermediate (I) and high (H) value of GSI for every rock group. This allows a practitioner to account for the structural and surface state of the rock cutting in the field by selecting the appropriate category. To do so, the range of GSI values for the rock types in each rock group is determined. This can be done according to Tables 5-11 in Marinos and Hoek (2000). The GSI categories are defined as: L is the minimum of the lower bound values for all rocks in the group; H is the maximum of upper bound values of all the rocks; and I is the median of all upper and lower bound values. In doing so, we captured the highest and lowest possible GSI values within each rock group. This choice errs on the conservative side since the parameter variance is amplified (the uncertainty introduced with this choice is discussed in Section 4.2.1). Note GSI is based on the assumption that randomly-orientated heavily fractured rock masses behave as an isotropic mass, therefore, the resulting guidelines should not be used for rock masses manifesting a dominant structural orientation (Li et al., 2008). This limitation of the guidelines is discussed further in Section 4.5.\n\n2.1.1\nDisturbance\nDifferent methods of excavation are employed for cuttings depending on the strength of the rock encountered. For weaker rocks and soils, excavation is generally carried out mechanically by a digger whereas for stronger rocks, it is quicker and cheaper to excavate by blasting. Some blasting techniques can significantly reduce the strength of the rock and in turn the stability of a cutting. Hence it is important to account for the different methods of excavation in the guidelines as they could result in different design inclinations. D was introduced into the G-H-B criterion to account for disturbance caused by blasting (Hoek et al., 2002). Guidelines for estimating D are outlined in Hoek et al. (2002), and updated in Hoek and Brown (2019). Hoek and Brown (2019) recommend to set D = 0 where the slope is undisturbed and a D = 1 for the case of maximum disturbance (where uncontrolled blasting takes place). We recommend developing two separate tables to accommodate different disturbance scenarios. The first scenario concerns mechanical excavation or controlled shallow blasting methods where negligible disturbance is caused (D\u00a0=\u00a00 is imposed across the whole slope) (Hoek et al., 2002). The second scenario concerns roadside cuttings blasted in an uncontrolled manner causing disturbance.\n\nHoek (2012) states that \u201cD should not be applied to the entire rock mass surrounding the excavation\u201d (p. 4). He outlines that D should be at its maximum at the exposed slope surface, decreasing with distance from the slope surface. In the literature, different functional relationships for the decrease of D with distance from the slope surface have been proposed: Li et al. (2011); Qian et al. (2017); Yang et al. (2020) adopted a linearly decreasing D function whereas Lupogo (2017) and Rose et al. (2018) assumed a negative exponential relationship. Hoek (2012) suggests that disturbance is best represented by imposing a Parallel Layer Model (PLM). Zheng et al. (2018) incorporate a PLM in their models to represent disturbance.\nWe chose to represent the decreasing value of D with distance from the cutting face for a disturbed cutting using a PLM. Parameterising a PLM requires assumptions about the maximum D, the extent (i.e. depth into the rock cutting) of disturbance and the functional form (e.g. linear, exponential) of the depth-disturbance relationship. Estimating these parameters is difficult because very few studies examine the extent of D and its spatial variation, especially in relation to roadside cuttings (most focus on blasting in the context of open-pit mines and tunnels). Hoek (2012) produced basic guidelines for the thickness of the disturbed zone focused on open-pit mining where blasting differs substantially from that used in cuttings. Yang et al. (2020) provides the best experimental data to date on the functional form of the depth-disturbance relationship based on in situ measurements of blasted cuttings. Using P-wave velocities measured at two strong rock cuttings at a hydro-power project they found that D linearly decreases from its maximum value (unity) at the surface to zero at some distance behind the surface. The extent of the D zone caused by excavating a bench of basalts and marble by presplit blasting was found to be 2 to 4\u00a0m depth (measured perpendicular to the cutting surface). Matheson (1995) investigated highway rock excavation by blasting using standard seismic refraction techniques. They found that the disturbance zones ranged from 2 to 4 m for controlled and 6\u20138\u00a0m for uncontrolled blasting. Based on these studies, we assumed a disturbance zone up to 8\u00a0m thick for uncontrolled blasting in stronger rocks. Therefore, we imposed a PLM, where D is one at the surface and decreases linearly to zero over a thickness of 8\u00a0m.\nThe table that accommodates uncontrolled blasting only needs to include rocks with hardness categories from \u2018Moderate\u2019 to \u2018Extremely hard\u2019 as blasting is highly unlikely in weaker rocks. To determine the number of layers for the PLM we ran stability analyses for an increasing number of layers starting with a single layer. Convergence to a result unaffected by the choice of the number of layers was deemed to be reached when a change in the FoS of the cutting of <1% was achieved. This convergence analysis was performed for the four cuttings with parameter values at the boundary of the parameter space (i.e. the minimum and maximum cutting height with most unstable and stable parameter value combinations in the table). The cutting inclinations in these models were chosen based on those in the undisturbed (D\u00a0=\u00a00) table for the same parameter combinations. The largest number of layers required for the calculated FoS not to be unduly affected by this choice was eight, thus we adopted an eight layer PLM in the disturbed cutting analyses. An example of the model set up for the disturbed cutting case is shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\n\n2.2\nMohr-Coulomb criterion\nThe M-C failure criterion is used to characterise the strength of soils (e.g. residual soils), as the G-H-B criterion has shown to be less accurate for these geomaterials (Hoek et al., 2002; Hoek and Brown, 2019). To be consistent with the L, I, H categorisation adopted for GSI, L, I and H strength categories were defined for combinations of cohesion (c\n\n'\n) and friction angle (\u03d5\n\n'\n) based on local estimates of c\n\n'\n, \u03d5\n\n'\n combinations for residual soils from published literature. These c\n\n'\n and \u03d5\n\n'\n combinations were ranked in order of strength, with the lowest and highest strength combinations designated to the L and H categories, respectively, and the median strength combination used as the c\n\n'\n - \u03d5\n\n'\n pair for the I category.\nColluvial soils are not included in the guidelines as it is highly unlikely that an entire cutting is made up of colluvial soil. In fact, modelled and measured colluvial soil depths on hillslopes in a range of upland landscapes worldwide suggest that colluvial soils are typically <1\u00a0m deep and rarely deeper than 2\u00a0m (Tesfa et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.3\nFactor of safety\nSlope stability depends not only on slope inclination but also slope height; therefore, a range of cutting heights should be included in the guidelines to represent the potential range for road cutting in the area of interest. For the Nepal guidelines these heights are: 5, 10, 20 and 30\u00a0m.\nFor cuttings, generally the lower the required FoS, the steeper the cutting and the cheaper. Where roads are heavily trafficked the economic and social consequence of failure becomes greater and, therefore, it is often desirable to design cuttings with higher FoS values (Geotechnical Engineering Office, 1984). If roads are less heavily trafficked and the economic and social consequence of failure is lower, a lower FoS is acceptable. Therefore, the guidelines should include at least two values of FoS to accommodate for different levels of risk: (1) a FoS value on roads where cutting failure carry low social and economic consequences and; (2) a FoS value to represent road cuttings that carry greater social and economic consequences (i.e. more heavily trafficked).\n\nLawrence and Hearn (1997) state that a FoS of 1.2\u20131.3 is appropriate where the negative consequences of failure are high. US Army Corps of Engineers (2003) state that when the uncertainty and the consequences of failure are both small, a FoS of 1.3 is acceptable, but where these are larger, they state that a higher FoS is required. The WSDOT Geotechnical Office (2022) oultine that a minimum FoS of 1.25 should be used for permanent cuts, fills, and landslide repairs. Trenter (2001) present a table for possible FoS for cut slope, outlining that the minimum FoS for a cutting (first-time failure rather than reactivation) of low environmental and economic risk should be 1.3. The highest FoS for a cutting with high environmental and economic is 1.5. Based on this literature, we chose to include FoS values of 1.3 for \u2018low consequence road cuttings\u2019 and 1.5 for \u2018high consequence road cuttings\u2019 cutting design.\n\n\n2.4\nNumerical analyses\nStability analyses are then carried out to determine cutting inclinations to achieve the assigned FoS for every combination of parameters discussed i.e. both D scenarios for each hardness group (with their assigned values for UCS, \u03b3 and m\n\ni\n) for L, I and H GSI category (or c\n\n'\n-\u03d5\n\n'\n combinations for soils) for every cutting height. For the case of the Nepal guidelines, stability analyses were conducted to establish cutting inclinations for every hardness group (UCS, m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 values outlined in Table 1), for each GSI category or c\n\n'\n-\u03d5\n\n'\n category (outlined in Table 1) for 5, 10, 20 and 30\u00a0m cutting heights to determine FoS values of 1.3 and 1.5.\nTo do so, a model of a cutting is designed according to the set of parameter combination values being tested. The cutting is given an initial inclination which is iteratively changed until the desired FoS (either 1.3 or 1.5) is obtained. This cutting inclination is recorded in the guidelines and then the same procedure is carried out for a different set of values of parameter combinations until the guidelines are complete. The external boundaries of the model were chosen such that they have no effect on the resulting FoS. We conducted the analyses using M-P (Morgenstern and Price, 1965) LEM in Slide2 (Rocscience).\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the number of slices to be implemented in our LEM analyses: simulations were conducted with an increasing number of slices starting with ten slices. A suitable number of slices was selected as the one such that the change in the resulting FoS is <1% for any further increase of the number. We found that a circular failure mechanism can be imposed for the analyses of undisturbed cuttings (D\u00a0=\u00a00) as the analyses are over three times quicker than that of non-circular failure and there is only <1% difference in FoS between circular and non-circular failure analysis. Instead non-circular failure mechanisms are required for the disturbed cutting cases.\n\nFig. 1 displays a model of a cutting in Slide2 with the analysis conducted in M-P LEM. The cutting had been excavated by uncontrolled blasting, therefore a PLM was set up with eight layers with a depth into the slope of 8\u00a0m (D\u00a0=\u00a01 at the surface layer with a step-wise decline with depth into the slope to D\u00a0=\u00a00 at 8 m). The cutting is 20\u00a0m in height and has geomaterial that falls into the \u2018Moderate\u2019 strength group (UCS\u00a0=\u00a037.5\u00a0MPa, \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a024 kN\/m3, m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a08), and low GSI category (GSI\u00a0=\u00a015). We gave an initial inclination of 60\u2218 and iteratively reduced the cutting inclination until the FoS was equal to 1.3. This was found at a cutting inclination of 44\u2218. This inclination is reported in Table 3.\nCutting inclinations corresponding to a desired FoS are presented as two tables (for disturbed and non-disturbed cuttings). Each table includes guidance for the practitioner on how to select the appropriate rock group and GSI category for their cutting. See Section 3.1 for guidelines developed using this methodology for Nepal and Ethiopia.\n\n\n2.5\nInclined upslope topography\nRoadside cuttings are often bounded on their upslope side by an inclined hillslope that is typically long relative to the cutting length. Therefore, hillslope topography is accounted for in the guidelines. To do so, the model domain has to be large enough in the horizontal direction to capture the critical failure mechanism. Also for the analysis to be realistic unweathered bedrock below the layer of the rock\/soil group of interest needs to be prescribed. The depth of the bedrock is a function of topography (St. Clair et al., 2015), but in the absence of such information, a hard bedrock at a depth equal to the height of the cutting was assumed. Vertical cutting geometries were modeled as 89\u2218.\nTo develop guidelines for cuttings with inclined upslope topography the same methodology was used as outlined in Sections 2.1 \u2013 2.4. Fig. 2\n presents an example of the model set-up for inclined upslope topography. This example is of a 20\u00a0m tall cutting in \u2018Weak\u2018rock (UCS\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0MPa, \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a024 kN\/m3 and m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a05) with GSI\u00a0=\u00a025 and inclined topography of 30\u2218. The \u2018weak\u2018rock is modelled as a 20\u00a0m layer above unweathered bedrock. For this example it was found that a cutting inclination of 61\u2218 achieves a FoS of 1.5.\n\n\n2.6\nAddressing seepage\nAll the stability analyses were performed assuming dry conditions since consideration of semi-saturated or saturated conditions requires characterisation of hydrological properties (e.g. hydraulic conductivity), which are highly variable in space, and the saturation state of the cutting, which depends on rainfall history and upslope topography. Unfortunately this information is not available in the vast majority of cases. In principle a parametric analysis could solve the issue; however, given the variability exhibited in the field by hydrological properties (typically three to five orders of magnitude in hydraulic conductivity) and their strong influence on seepage, the resulting variability in FoS would be too great to be of use in establishing design cutting inclinations. In addition, the guidelines would become very complicated if different options for hydrological variables were included.\nIn order to account for seepage in the guidelines whilst avoiding potential variability we recommend identifying the threshold seepage conditions under which a dry analysis remains appropriate (i.e. seepage does not affect the FoS) and thus where the tables remain applicable. To this end, for every combination of parameters included in the dry guidelines, the threshold seepage conditions were identified by performing coupled steady-state hydro-mechanical slope stability analyses consisting of: first, a FE steady-state hydraulic analysis to determine the phreatic line and pore pressures in the slope; followed by a LEM slope stability analysis. In each FE steady-state hydraulic analysis, a total head was imposed at the upslope boundary of the domain. This head was initially selected as high as the cutting toe, and incrementally increased until the FoS resulting from the subsequent mechanical slope stability analysis, deviates by >1% from the FoS determined for the dry case. The depth of the phreatic surface from the ground surface is recorded at this point, measured at a distance equal to the cutting height upslope of its crest (see Fig. 3a & 3b). To record these values in table format, this depth (h) is normalised by the cutting height (H) to give the ratio: h\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a0h\/H. The further the phreatic line above this depth threshold (h\n\nw\n), the less reliable the guidelines (i.e. higher error) and the more caution should be used. In cases where the phreatic line is far above the threshold, we recommend against the use of these tables.\nFor scenarios where h\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00 (i.e. where the slope is fully saturated at a distance H upslope from the cutting crest) and the FoS is not affected, a pressure head equal to zero is applied along the uplsope ground surface (instead of imposing the total head along the upslope boundary). The extent of this zero pressure zone was incrementally increased downslope until the FoS deviated from the values obtained in the dry case by >1%. In these cases, the distance (d) from the cutting crest to the nearest saturated upslope ground surface point is recorded (see Fig. 3c & 3d); it can then be normalised by H to obtain the ratio: l\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a0d\/H. Smaller values of this normalised distance to surface saturation indicate a more saturated slope. When both l\n\nw\n and h\n\nw\n are nil, the FoS is unaffected by seepage even when the slope is fully saturated.\n\nFig. 4\n displays an example of the seepage and stability analyses results in Slide2 for the case of a 20\u00a0m cutting in the categories we defined for undisturbed \u2018Weak\u2019 rock (UCS\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0MPa, \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a024 kN\/m3 and m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a05) with GSI\u00a0=\u00a025, for a desired FoS of 1.5. Without seepage, this cutting scenario achieves a FoS of 1.51 at a cutting angle of 62\u2218. Applying seepage, the FoS reduced by 1% (to 1.49) when the phreatic surface at a distance H from the cutting crest was h\u00a0=\u00a012.6\u00a0m below the ground surface (i.e. h\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a012.6\u221520\u00a0=\u00a00.63). For this scenario, if the vertical phreatic line depth to cutting height ratio is <0.63, the guidelines are invalid.\n\n\n2.7\nApplication of the method to Nepal and Ethiopia\n\n2.7.1\nBackground to road cuttings in Nepal\nNepal is a country in South Asia situated in the Himalaya, a tectonically active mountain range. Nepal receives 80% of its rainfall within four months of the year during the monsoon season (Shakya and Nirula, 2008). The steep landscape and frequent intense rainfall results in many landslides and these effects are amplified by rapid, extensive and in places haphazard (i.e. lacking investigation and design) construction of roads. Road building to connect towns and villages has been a priority of the Nepali government and society for at least two decades and has been identified as a key driver for economic development locally and nationally (Rankin et al., 2017; Sudmeier-Rieux et al., 2019). The density of Nepal's road network more than tripled between 1990 and 2016 (from 0.14 to 0.50\u00a0km\/km2, Department of Roads (2017)). This growth occurred in both the strategic and local road networks, and was mirrored by the rapid, but undocumented, construction of informal roads. Several recent studies propose a substantial link between road related landslides in Nepal and the investment of time, knowledge and funds in road construction (Dahal et al., 2006; Lennartz, 2013; Froude and Petley, 2018; Sudmeier-Rieux et al., 2019). Froude and Petley (2018) found that 43% of the fatal landslides that were triggered by construction in Nepal occurred along roads compared to only 7% in China. The failure of these roadside cuttings, along formal and informal roads, can have devastating economic and social consequences (Froude and Petley, 2018; McAdoo et al., 2018).\nMost practitioners in Nepal use guidelines for road cuttings that are published by the Government of Nepal Department of Roads e.g. Department of Roads (2007, 2013, 2016). These guidelines do not include the excavation history of the road, nor do they include user inputs for a specified FoS.\nWe conducted qualitative data collection to find out about the consistency of the knowledge of practitioners that are in charge of the design of road cuttings with one another. Questionnaires were sent via email to four different engineering organisations\/companies based in Nepal. 14 completed questionnaires from practitioners were received. The questionnaires were short (five questions) to encourage completion and they were answered anonymously as they were not aiming to test the individual participants' knowledge. The participants were asked to use the resources that they typically employed to determine rock cutting inclinations for new cuttings. Each question included a picture of a roadside cutting in Nepal alongside characteristics for the cutting including: cutting height; weathering grade; hardness; rock type; road type; and cutting history. The participants then had to select one of three possible cutting inclination ranges that would be appropriate for that cutting. The answers included the most appropriate range according to a key Nepali design manual Department of Roads (2007), and the two other ranges which either both sat above, both sat below or one sat above and one sat below the most appropriate range. The second part to the question asked the practitioner to outline what characteristics they used to make that judgement. The questionnaire outcomes were processed and analysed using NVivo (QSR International Pty Ltd., 2020) to find the common relationships between the characteristics and inclination, in addition to assessing what characteristics are typically used. We reviewed the answers to the questions selecting the appropriate cutting angle range against the guidelines given in Department of Roads (2007). Across all questions 29% to 93% of participants chose the most appropriate inclination range. On average, 50% of participants chose the most appropriate answer with a standard deviation of 25%. \u2018Rock type\u2019 was the most prevalent characteristic chosen to be prioritised in selecting a stable cutting inclination. Whilst the \u2018height of the slope\u2019 was stated alongside the greatest proportion of correct ranges of inclination.\nThe results of the questionnaires suggest that among the practitioners in Nepal there is considerable variability in their knowledge and the resources that they use. The rigor of the Department of Roads (2007) guidelines is discussed further in Section 4.1. Based on the findings of this qualitative data collection, we argue that there is a need for new guidelines for roadside cutting inclinations that are clear and that can be easily used by a wider range of practitioners.\n\n\n2.7.2\nBackground to road cuttings in Ethiopia\nEthiopia has extensive highlands that range from 1500 to 3500\u00a0m above sea level. Plateaus formed from successive basalt lava flows are a common feature in the landscape. These plateaus have been cut by river channels resulting in several valleys exhibiting cliffs and benches (Hearn and Massey, 2009). Ethiopia's road network has expanded from 20,000 to 110,000\u00a0km over the last three decades so exposure to cutting failure hazard has also grown with road construction and widening projects often triggering cutting instabilities (Hearn, 2018). As with other LIC\/LMICs in mountainous areas, the stabilisation of road cuttings can be inhibited by poor understanding of landslide processes (Hearn and Shakya, 2017). As Ethiopia looks to expand its road network further, with an aim of totalling 201,750\u00a0km by 2028, slope stabilisation is critical to minimise future losses (Hearn, 2018).\n\n\n2.7.3\nNepal specific methodology\nCommon Nepali rock types, identified by field observations and literature, were categorised into six groups (\u2018Very weak\u2019 to \u2018Extremely hard\u2019) with discrete ranges of UCS based on the Brown (1981) hardness scale. Values for m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 for common rocks in Nepal were identified using Marinos and Hoek (2000) and Fine (2021) respectively. We were able to corroborate and amend these values using published literature for rocks in Nepal (Khanna and Dubey, 2021; Panthee et al., 2016) for the majority of the metamorphic rocks. The midpoint of each UCS range is assigned to each rock group, whilst the mean of m\n\ni\n and \u03b3 values are assigned. As the values for UCS, \u03b3 and m\n\ni\n are assigned to the rock groups, they do not have to be chosen by practitioners. The values for UCS, \u03b3 and m\n\ni\n were, therefore, not included in the tables to keep the tables as concise and user-friendly as possible. Instead, the ranges of reported values for each rock group and their assigned value are stated in Table 1, in addition to the values chosen to represent GSI.\nThe L, I and H values for GSI for each rock group were assigned by evaluating Marinos and Hoek (2000), as discussed in the methodology. These values are outlined in the resulting set of tables, alongside guidance for the practitioner on how to select the GSI category. For residual soils we determined L, I and H strength combinations of c\n\n'\n and \u03d5\n\n'\n based on those outlined in Table 1 of Ray et al. (2019).\nWe included four values for the height of the cuttings that capture the typical range of cutting heights along roads in Nepal: 5, 10, 20, and 30\u00a0m based on field observations conducted in 2019 along local and strategic roads in the Nepali provinces of Bagmati and Province No. 2.\nBlasting in Nepal is currently primarily planned and executed by the Nepali army in a controlled manner. A pneumatic drill is used to drill holes of 32\u201336\u00a0mm diameter to a depth of 1\u20133\u00a0m (Directorate of Development and Construction, Nepali Army, 2020). The standard depth of excavation to achieve a specified cutting is 300\u00a0mm deep into a rock face (Department of Roads, 2018). Given that excavation to this depth will cause negligible disturbance, we assumed a D value of zero to the entire cutting where these modern blasting methods are used. A D value of zero is also imposed where only mechanical excavation has taken place (consistent with recommendations of Hoek et al. (2002); Hoek (2012)). Older roadside cuttings excavated >30\u00a0years ago, are more likely to have been subject to uncontrolled blasting that would disturb the cutting. To account for the different disturbance scenarios, we include two tables of guidelines for roadside cutting inclinations in Nepal: (1) for young (< 30\u00a0year old) or mechanically excavated cuttings (Table 2) and (2) for historically blasted cuttings where blasting may have been uncontrolled (Table 3). Following the aforementioned methodology we found that eight layers were optimal to represent disturbance in the PLM.\nA check was carried out to see if each cutting inclinations presented in the guidelines is compliant with Eurocode 7 Design Approach 1 Combinations 1 & 2. It was found that they all had an Over Design Factor of greater than one, thereby, being compliant.\nHillslope inclinations of 15 and 30\u2218 were chosen to represent hillslope topography for roadside cuttings in Nepal. The analyses were only performed for undisturbed cutting as there is great complexity in setting up a model that incorporates a PLM with an inclined upslope boundary. For disturbed cases with non-horizontal topography, it is recommended that numerical analyses are conducted on a slope-by-slope basis. We then used the methodology presented above to develop guidelines for undisturbed road cuttings with upslope boundaries inclined at 30\u2218 (Table 4) and 15\u2218 (Table 5). In some cases for cuttings in \u2018Very weak\u2019 and \u2018Weak\u2019 geomaterial with inclined topography of 30\u2218 (Table 4) it was not possible to determine cutting angles to generate the required FoS. In these cases, the cutting angle and upper slope angle were too similar (typically within 10\u2218 of one another), and the failure surface extends far upslope resulting in a low FoS. In these instances an \u2018X' is placed in the table.\nBy following the method outlined in Section 2.6, we conducted seepage and stability analyses to identify the seepage conditions under which our tables are valid. The resulting seepage guidelines are displayed as Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9. A symbol (\u2020) was used in the table to denote cases where l\n\nw\n was calculated or l\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00 and h\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00.\n\n\n2.7.4\nEthiopia specific methodology\nThe methodology presented in Sections 2.1 - 2.4 was followed to develop guidelines for road cuttings in Ethiopia. The common Ethiopian rock types to characterise the rock groups in these guidelines were taken from the \u2018typical rock and soil types\u2019 outlined in Table 5 of Hearn and Pettifer (2016). Hearn and Pettifer (2016) included these rock types based on field observations and from those outlined in Ayalew et al. (2009). Only five groups were included in the undisturbed guidelines for Ethiopia, as compared to six for Nepal. This is because Ethiopian geomaterials that would fit into the \u2018Extremely hard\u2019 group are less common. The G-H-B parameter values were then estimated for each group using the methododology presented. Values of UCS, GSI and m\n\ni\n were determined for the Ethiopian geomaterials using Marinos and Hoek (2000). The majority of values of \u03b3 were taken from Fine (2021). Estimates of \u03b3 for Tuff were taken from Asniar et al. (2019) who evaluate the properties of Tuff from around the world (values specific to Ethiopia were not found). As with Nepal, we included four values for the heights of the cutting that cover the majority of typical cutting sizes along roads in Ethiopia: 5, 10, 20 and 30\u00a0m. Blasting in Ethiopia is currently carried out in a controlled manner along roads by the Ethiopian army (personal communications in 2020). In the past, uncontrolled blasting may have been used to excavate roads. Therefore, two tables are developed for Ethiopia to account for: (1) mechanical excavation or controlled blasting (Table 10) and (2) uncontrolled blasting that may have taken place in the past (Table 11).\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nSet of guidelines\nIn this section we present guidelines for Nepal and Ethiopia using the methodology introduced in this paper.\nThe following tables are included in the guidelines for road cuttings in Nepal, with associated tables for acceptable seepage scenarios in parentheses:\n\n\u2022\nFlat topography:\n\n\u2212\nMechanically excavated: Table 2 (Table 6)\n\n\n\u2212\nExcavated through historical blasting: Table 3 (Table 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nTopography inclined at 30\u2218 over the horizontal: Table 4 (Table 8)\n\n\n\u2022\nTopography inclined at 15\u2218 over the horizontal: Table 5 (Table 9)\n\n\n\nThe following tables are included in the guidelines for road cuttings in Ethiopia:\n\n\u2022\nFlat topography:\n\n\u2212\nMechanically excavated: Table 10\n\n\n\n\u2212\nExcavated through historical blasting: Table 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive a cutting inclination from the resulting guidelines, a practitioner should: (1) determine the excavation method of the cutting and select the appropriate table to represent the disturbance, (2) select the hardness group for the cutting by carrying out the field tests outlined in the table; (3) decide on the appropriate level of safety required based on the consequence of failure along the road, (4) select the cutting height; and (5) select a L\/I\/H GSI (or c\n\n'\n,\u00a0\u03d5\n\n'\n\u00a0combination) category for the cutting using the descriptions in the table for guidance. Further guidance on how to use the guidelines is given in Appendix A.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nNepali applications\nTo demonstrate use of the guidelines, three cases exhibiting differing slope conditions along roads in Nepal are presented in Tables 12, 13 and 14\n\n\n. The cases are all of a post failure cutting. The guidelines are used to demonstrate what inclination the cuttings would need to be cut to for stability of the desired FoS.\n\n\n3.3\nTrends\nHere we discuss the trends observed in the guidelines developed for Nepal and Ethiopia. Across all tables the following trends can be observed: (1) steeper inclinations with increasing hardness; (2) steeper inclinations with higher GSI values (and combinations of c\n\n'\n and \u03d5\n\n'\n); (3) steeper inclinations with decreasing cutting height; and (4) steeper inclinations with lower FoS. These trends reflect well known physical principles of slope stability: a higher strength of the slope geomaterials and lower slope height are beneficial to slope stability so the cutting can be made steeper; likewise a lower requirement in terms of FoS allows a more aggressive cutting.\nIn Table 2, there is great variability in the inclinations outlined in the \u2018Very weak\u2019 category (e.g. residual soils) from the low to high strength combinations of c\n\n'\n and \u03d5\n\n'\n due to the significant difference in the values of c\n\n'\n and \u03d5\n\n'\n from Ray et al. (2019) in each category. It can be noted that some of the cutting inclinations prescribed for high strength residual soils are close to vertical. The higher strength residual soils are likely to be weathered \u2018Hard\u2019-\u2018Extremely hard\u2019 rock, reflected by their M-C parameter values (Wesley, 2010).\nMany of the tables (Tables 2, 3, 5, 10 and 11) include prescribed inclinations that are below 30\u2218 in the strength categories of \u2018Very weak\u2019 and \u2018Weak\u2019. Cuttings of such shallow inclinations could require the removal of significant volumes of material. Where this is not feasible, the construction of additional slope stabilisation measures (e.g. walls or anchors) may be adopted to allow a steeper cutting inclination.\nThe steepest possible (i.e. vertical) cutting inclination is recommended for slopes made up of \u2018Hard\u2019, \u2018Very hard\u2019 or \u2018Extremely hard\u2019 rock across all tables. Even uncontrolled blasting (Tables 3 and 11) makes no difference to the cutting inclination for the hardest (i.e. \u2018Very hard\u2019 and \u2018Extremely hard\u2019) rocks independent of GSI; nor for \u2018Moderate\u2019 or \u2018Hard\u2019 rocks, if they have experienced little weathering (GSI=H). This is true irrespective of cutting height and choice of FoS and is likely because these materials can all sustain vertical cuttings. When blasting disturbance is limited (e.g. Tables 2, 10, 4 and 5) they are likely even more stable (higher FoS) than in the case of cuttings with blast disturbance (Tables 3 and 11); however, in both cases they could sustain an overhang at the FoS values examined here. Because overhangs are not considered, blasting has no observable effect.\nIn non-vertical cases, blasting can have a very large impact on the cutting angle. For the cutting inclinations in Nepali \u2018Weak\u2019 rock with flat topographies, blasting reduced the angle by 11\u201344\u2218 and 25\u2218 on average; for the inclinations in \u2018Moderate\u2019 rock the range was 6\u201347\u2218 and the mean 27\u2218 (excluding cases that remained vertical). Such large reductions would have very significant implications for the cost (and even the feasibility) of implementing a cutting.\nWe compared the guidelines developed for Nepal and Ethiopia by evaluating the absolute differences in cutting inclinations for each equivalent scenario in the \u2018Very weak\u2019-\u2018Moderate\u2019 groups of the tables for mechanically excavated cuttings in flat topography. We ignored \u2018Hard\u2019-\u2018Extremely hard\u2019 groups since they can sustain vertical cuttings in all cases. The mean difference in cutting inclinations across all scenarios was 4\u2218, whilst the maximum was 39\u2218. The greatest difference in cutting inclination was in the \u2018Very weak\u2019 group with a median of 15\u2218 whilst the median for the \u2018Weak\u2019 group was 3\u2218 and for the \u2018Moderate\u2019 group was 0\u2218 (implying no functional difference).\nIn comparing the Nepal table with flat topography (Table 2) to those with inclined topography (Tables 4 and 5), the following can be stated: (1) the scenarios with vertical inclinations were unchanged, (2) for non-vertical scenarios, the cutting inclinations in Table 2 are up to 4\u2218 higher than than those in Table 4 (30\u2218 inclined) and, (3) for non-vertical scenarios, the cutting inclinations in Table 2 are up to 1\u2218 higher than in Table 5 (15\u2218 inclined). Based on these results, it may not be necessary to perform stability analyses to develop guidelines for an inclined upslope.\n\nTables 6, 7, 8 and 9 present h\n\nw\n values which are used to describe the threshold level of slope saturation where seepage starts to affect the stability of the cutting, i.e. the resulting FoS deviates from the values obtained in the dry case. The higher h\n\nw\n, the lower the height of the phreatic line that affects the stability of the cutting (i.e. the greater affect that seepage has on the stability of the cutting). The tables indicate that the largest h\n\nw\n values are in the weakest rock group. Within a rock grouping (row in the table), the largest h\n\nw\n values tend to be in the taller cuttings and for lower GSI values. Therefore, as expected, the weaker and\/or taller the cutting, the greater the influence of seepage on stability. Also the largest h\n\nw\n values are in the tables for the cuttings with an inclined upslope boundary (Tables 8 and 9). This relationship is a reference frame effect created by measuring the depth of the phreatic surface at the upslope. Some of these relationships can be observed in Fig. 5\n, which displays the results of the seepage and stability analyses on a 30\u00a0m high cutting made up of \u2018Very weak\u2019 and \u2018Extremely hard\u2019 geomaterials for both flat and inclined upslope topographies.\nAcross all tables, the majority of vertical cutting designs are not affected by seepage (l\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00 and h\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a00). Only a small number of vertical cutting cases at the lowest GSI and 30\u00a0m height are affected by seepage conditions, albeit with h\n\nw\n being very small, in Tables 7, 8 and 9.\n\n\n3.4\nFailure mechanisms\nThe failure mechanisms observed in the results of the stability analyses typically originate from a distance of 0.2\u20131 times cutting height upslope of the cutting crest and daylight at the toe of the cutting. Generally, the weaker the material, the shallower the failure (this can be observed in Fig. 5a compared to 5c). The non-circular failure mechanisms observed in the results of the disturbed cuttings (with PLM) were very shallow for the weaker rocks, with the failure planes being at the intersection of the second to third layer (1\u20132\u00a0m) or third to fourth layer (3\u20134\u00a0m) of the PLM. This is expected given the strong sensitivity of the G-H-B strength envelope to D, reflecting the decline in rock strength with disturbance caused by excavation, and since D declines from the surface, the surface rock assigned has a very weak G-H-B strength envelope. The failure occurs along the intersections of the layers, as these are the points of maximum depth within a weaker material.\nFor cuttings excavated in inclined topographies, the failure mechanism originated slightly further upslope than those in horizontal topographies at a distance of 0.4\u20132 times the cutting height back from the crest and daylight at the toe of the cutting (this can be observed in Fig. 5 by comparing 5a to 5b). For some of the vertical cuttings with inclined topographies, the critical failure mechanism originated much further upslope (see Fig. 5d). As with the horizontal topography, the weaker the material, the shallower the failure mechanism (observed by comparing Fig. 5c to 5d).\nThe circular failure mechanisms observed in the stability analysis of undisturbed cuttings with seepage were consistent with those of undisturbed cuttings without seepage. For cuttings excavated by uncontrolled blasting (represented with a PLM), seepage conditions responsible for a change in FoS caused non-circular failure mechanism at the toe of the cutting. When the phreatic surface reaches a certain height the failure mechanism daylights at the cutting surface close to the toe. The failure mechanism then changes from being a shallow failure that encompasses the entire cutting to a failure that remains shallow affecting only the lower part of the cutting, near the toe. The failure mechanism that extends beyond the cutting is most critical under dry conditions because it maximises the volume to failure surface area relationship for the sliding mass. However, the phreatic surface is closer to the ground surface at the toe of the cutting and as a result material strength is lower and the failure surface daylights on the cutting face rather than the upslope topography. This does not happen for all phreatic surface configurations, but only once the phreatic surface reaches the weakest layers within the PLM, because the gradient in rock strength imposed by blasting damage forces the failure surface to remain close to the ground surface.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nHere, we test the rigor of the Nepal guidelines against other published stability charts (see Section 4.1.1) and use case studies to test the usability of the guidelines relative to both existing guidelines and published stability charts (see Section 4.1.2). We then discuss the sensitivity of the Nepal and Ethiopia guidelines to input and model uncertainties (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, respectively). We then go on to test the adaptability of these guidelines to interpolation (Section 4.3) and discuss whether the guidelines could be use globally (Section 4.4). Finally, the limitations of the guidelines are outlined (Section 4.5).\n\n4.1\nComparison of the Nepal guidelines to other charts and guidelines\n\n4.1.1\nRigor relative to other charts and guidelines\nHere, we compare the rigor of the Nepal guidelines against other published stability charts (Li et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2013; Wyllie, 2017) by evaluating the same parameter sets and comparing the predictions. A high degree of consistency between predictions from different methods will give confidence in the rigor of the methods.\n\nLi et al. (2008) use limit analysis to develop a series of stability charts using G-H-B criterion for undisturbed (i.e. D\u00a0=\u00a00) dry cuttings. The charts are organised by either cutting inclination or GSI, with each plotting m\n\ni\n against the slope stability number (i.e. N\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\nci\n\u2215\u03b3HF, where \u03c3\n\nci\n is the rock unconfined compressive strength), with contours indicating slope inclinations or GSI values. Shen et al. (2013) use LEM to develop a series of charts that satisfy G-H-B criterion for a dry cutting with \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a045\no\n (\u03b2: slope inclination). They present a set of charts organised by m\n\ni\n and a so-called strength ratio: SR\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\nci\n\u2215\u03b3H. The charts organised by m\n\ni\n plot SR against FoS, whilst the charts organised by SR plot m\n\ni\n against FoS. Wyllie (2017) use LEM with a circular failure mechanism and the M-C failure criterion to develop a series of charts for cuttings with different levels of saturation, though we use only the dry charts here (Fig. 9.6, p. 247). These charts relate the FoS to \u03b3, \u03d5\n\n'\n, c\n\n'\n, H and \u03b2. Li et al. (2008); Shen et al. (2013); Wyllie (2017) are for cuttings with horizontal upslope topography, therefore we use our set of guidelines made for cuttings in horizontal topography. Li et al. (2008) and Wyllie (2017) charts do not account for disturbance, therefore, we considered an undisturbed cutting.\nWe tested our guidelines against stability charts from the literature for three slope scenarios (Table 15\n). The parameter combination for these scenarios are outlined in Appendix B. Only Scenario 1 included results from Shen et al. (2013), since their charts are only applicable to cuttings of 45\u2218.\nThe outcomes of our guidelines were further corroborated by the Carranza-Torres and Hormazabal (2018) method (discussed in Section 4.2), with the predictions always within 1%.\nThese comparisons demonstrate that our guidelines predict cutting inclinations that are consistently very close to those of Wyllie and Mah (2004); Shen et al. (2013); Wyllie (2017); Carranza-Torres and Hormazabal (2018), but considerably different from those of Li et al. (2008). Shen et al. (2013) highlighted the differences between their stability numbers and those of Li et al. (2008), attributing this to a different definition of FoS purportedly employed by Li et al. (2008) in deriving their charts. However, we find this explanation unlikely because Wyllie (2017); Carranza-Torres and Hormazabal (2018) and our own study all use the same FoS definition as Li et al. (2008) but report different results. Whatever the reason for the discrepancy, the very close agreement of our results with Shen et al. (2013); Wyllie (2017); Carranza-Torres and Hormazabal (2018) provides a robust validation for our method and lead us to recommend not to use Li et al. (2008) stability charts as a design tool for cuttings.\n\n\n4.1.2\nUsability relative to other charts and guidelines\nWe tested the usability of our guidelines for Nepal by comparison with existing guidelines of the manual produced by the Nepali Department of Roads (Department of Roads, 2007) and stability charts of Li et al. (2008); Shen et al. (2013); Wyllie (2017) utilising case studies for the Nepal cases outlined in Section 3.2. Department of Roads (2007) presents several tables from different sources to recommend cutting inclinations for different scenarios.\nCase one (C1) is 30\u00a0m high cutting in broken up siltstone with a desired FoS of 1.5 and inclined upslope topography of 30\u2218 (see Table 12 for details). Our guidelines prescribe a cutting inclination of 59\u2218 accounting for inclined topography (60\u2218 for flat topography). Using Table C3.6 (Annex C, p. 12) in Department of Roads (2007), for cuttings without structural control, C1 can be categorised as blocky with a rough surface, thus the prescribed inclination range is 40\u201345\u2218. They give no indication of the associated FoS. The GSI value for C1 (GSI\u00a0=\u00a015) lies at the midpoint between two of the Li et al. (2008) charts, therefore, we determined the inclination (calculating N) using both charts and took the average; a cutting inclination to achieve a FoS of 1.50 was 71\u2218. With Shen et al. (2013), we used the chart for m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a010 (Fig. 5b, p. 214) (m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a08 in C1). The values calculated for SR (SR\u00a0=\u00a052.1) was not within the axes of the chart, providing no guidance on the inclination. To use Wyllie (2017), we converted the G-H-B parameters to M-C using the method of Renani and Martin (2020), to approximate a slope inclination of 58\u2218 for FoS\u00a0=\u00a01.5.\nCase two (C2) is 30\u00a0m high cutting in weathered claystone with a desired FoS of 1.3 and inclined upslope topography of 15\u2218 (see Table 13 for details). On guidelines for this case with horizontal topography prescribe a cutting inclination of 39\u2218. As with C1, Table C3.6 of Department of Roads (2007) is used, categorising C2 as blocky with a smooth surface to get a prescribed inclination range of 35\u201340\u2218. For Li et al. (2008) we used the chart for GSI\u00a0=\u00a010 (Fig. 10, p. 695). We calculated N\u00a0=\u00a016.0 to estimate that a 47\u2218 cutting inclination would achieve a FoS of 1.30. Fig. 5a (p. 214) from Shen et al. (2013), for m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a05 and a cutting inclination of 45\u2218 predicts a FoS of 1.10 (SR\u00a0=\u00a020.8). A cutting inclination of 38\u2218 was derived from the Wyllie (2017) chart.\nCase three (C3) is 20\u00a0m high cutting opened by blasting in broken up phyllite with an horizontal upslope and a desired FoS of 1.5 (see Table 14 for details). For this case our guidelines predict a slope inclination of 40\u2218. However, none of the other charts account for upslope inclination or blasting. Our guidelines prescribe a horizontal unblasted inclination of 67\u2218. Table C3.6 of Department of Roads (2007) is used, categorising the rock as disturbed with smooth surfaces to get a prescribed inclination range of 35\u201340\u2218. As with C1, the GSI for C3 (GSI\u00a0=\u00a015) is at the midpoint between the Li et al. (2008) charts, so we wanted to take the average from two charts. However, the value calculated for N lies beyond the y-axis of the chart for GSI\u00a0=\u00a020. From the chart for GSI\u00a0=\u00a010 a cutting inclination of 70\u2218 will achieve a FoS of 1.50. We were not able to use the Shen et al. (2013) charts as the values calculated for SR was not within the axes of the most appropriate chart (m\n\ni\n\u00a0=\u00a010). A cutting inclination of 66\u2218 was derived from the Wyllie (2017) chart.\nThe following comments can be made as a result of this exercise: (1) the cutting inclinations from Department of Roads (2007) for the three cases were similar, despite significant differences in rock characteristics and slope geometries; (2) the Department of Roads (2007) do not specify the FoS; (3) Li et al. (2008) can be used to approximate the cutting inclination but N must be calculated with precise G-H-B parameter values to use the charts; (4) since the Shen et al. (2013) charts are only for cutting inclinations of 45\u2218, they can only indicate whether a cutting should be inclined above or below this angle; (5) the Wyllie (2017) charts can only be used if the M-C parameter values are known; and (6) none of discussed charts\/stability charts account for the influence of an inclined upslope section nor of the excavation induced disturbance to the slope. Based on the presented case studies, we suggest that our guidelines for Nepal improve on the usability of the discussed stability charts as no calculations or knowledge of exact parameter values are required to use our guidelines. In comparison to Department of Roads (2007) our guidelines are presented in a concise format, are transparent in the way that they were developed, and offer a choice on the resulting FoS. In addition, our guidelines take the disturbance caused by excavation into account which is not tackled in any of the charts\/guidelines other than Shen et al. (2013).\n\n\n\n4.2\nSensitivity to uncertainties\n\n4.2.1\nInput uncertainties\nA key desirable property for the guidelines is the ability to quantify the error resulting from uncertainties. To this end we performed a parameter sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of the Nepal and Ethiopia guidelines to user-defined inputs from field observations (practitioner's choices). This was done by determining the differences in the cutting inclinations of adjacent categories, and thereby estimating the error in cutting inclination that could result from an incorrect category choice.\nWe determined the differences in cutting inclinations between adjacent hardness groups (rows) in the tables, for given heights and GSI values (e.g. H\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0m, GSI\u00a0=\u00a0L, difference in cutting inclinations from \u2018Weak\u2019 to \u2018Moderate\u2019). In comparing these differences in each table, the highest median difference is found between the two weakest hardness groups: in Tables 4, 5 and 10 between the \u2018Very weak\u2019 and \u2018Weak\u2019 categories (26\u2218, 63%; 13\u2218, 16%; and 13\u2218, 28%; respectively) and in Tables 3 and 11 (for blasted cuttings) between \u2018Weak\u2019 and \u2018Moderate\u2019 categories (24\u2218, 72%; 38\u2218, 92%; respectively). Across all the tables, the highest values of absolute difference were in the Ethiopia guidelines for blasted cuttings (Table 11), with 57\u2218 being the largest difference. A general observation across all tables is the lower the GSI the higher the differences in cutting inclinations between hardness groups.\nTo reduce the uncertainty between hardness groups, extra groups could be included in the guidelines, particularly between the weaker groups where uncertainties are greater. However, more groups would also make the tables harder to read and use. The groups here employed are already well established in the literature (Brown, 1981; Marinos and Hoek, 2000) whereas greater granularity would require the use of unfamiliar extra categories with increased judgement required by practitioners to determine the appropriate group.\nThe same sensitivity exercise was carried out to assess the differences in cutting inclinations between adjacent GSI categories, for given cutting heights and hardness categories. Across all the tables, in the majority of cases, there was a larger difference of cutting inclinations between the GSI categories of L and I relative to that between I and H. For example, in Table 2, the midpoint of absolute differences between L and I was 13\u2218 (17%), and that between I and H was 0\u2218 (0%). The maximum absolute difference between GSI categories in Table 2 was 62\u2218 (221%), between L and I for \u2018Very weak\u2019 rocks in a 5\u00a0m cutting. In the majority of tables (Tables 2, 3, 5, 11), generally the weaker the rock, the greater the difference in cutting inclinations between GSI values.\nIn comparing the differences in GSI categories between the Nepal and Ethiopia guidelines for mechanically excavated cuttings, there is slightly less variability in cutting inclinations between GSI values within the \u2018Very weak\u2019 rock group for Ethiopia (Table 10) than Nepal (Table 2), with median differences of 12\u2218 and 19\u2218 respectively. This reflects the different types of material within the \u2018Very weak\u2019 group in the two countries: primarily tuffs characterised using G-H-B criterion for Ethiopia; and residual soils characterised using the M-C criterion for Nepal. The parameter values are thus more tightly constrained in the Ethiopian case.\nIn defining the values for the GSI categories we used the maximum and minimum value of all the rocks in one group. The uncertainty between GSI categories could be reduced by defining the high value as the mean of the maximum GSI values for all the rocks in one group, and the low value as the mean of the minimum GSI values for all the rocks in one group.\nIn cases where the design cutting inclinations are particularly sensitive to practitioner parameter choices, geotechnical investigation and numerical analysis are highly recommended. For geotechnical engineers who do not have access to an appropriate numerical analysis software, we suggest using a simpler computational tool to conduct the slope stability analysis. For example, the slope stability analyses tool of Carranza-Torres and Hormazabal (2018), which can be implemented in any spreadsheet software, could be used with the M-C to G-H-B parameter conversion method of Renani and Martin (2020). Unfortunately, this tool cannot be used for the cutting cases with disturbance or for any additional complexities (e.g. seepage). More detail is given on this method in Appendix A.2.\n\n\n4.2.2\nModel uncertainties\nThe stability analyses were performed using rigorous M-P LEM. Nevertheless uncertainties are introduced by the very fact of employing a numerical method. These uncertainties are difficult to quantify, but are certainly small in relative terms.\nThe methodology used here can be followed to develop guidelines for any location in the world with the caveat that the geotechnical characteristics for geomaterials in the location are known. If these characteristics are not available, they need to be inferred from a similar material type. This is likely to add model uncertainty that is difficult to measure as the difference between the true and inferred parameter values would be unknown.\nOverall, we believe that the results (slope inclinations) are more sensitive to input uncertainty than the model uncertainty. However, input uncertainties are less likely than model uncertainties. The greatest potential input uncertainty lies within the weaker categories and to a lesser degree between the lower GSI classes of the tables.\n\n\n\n4.3\nInterpolation between table entries\nStability analyses conducted for cutting heights at class boundaries (e.g. 7.5\u00a0m, between 5 and 10\u00a0m) suggest that cutting inclinations can be linearly interpolated between cutting height classes (eight cases were tested in different hardness and GSI categories). For example, for a 15\u00a0m high cutting in \u2018Weak\u2019 rock with GSI=I using Table 2, the average of the inclinations prescribed for 10 and 20\u00a0m cuttings, (i.e. (87\u2218\u00a0+\u00a069\u2218)\/2\u00a0=\u00a078\u2218) will provide the most accurate estimate of cutting inclination. In this case, the stability analysis for the cutting inclined at 78\u2218 for a height of 15\u00a0m returns a FoS of 1.37 (a 5% error in FoS). By conducting an individual stability analysis for this case (H\u00a0=\u00a015\u00a0m), it was found that an inclination of 75\u2218 would achieve a FoS of 1.30.\nWe performed stability analyses to examine errors introduced when a GSI value lies on a class boundary and a user must choose one of the adjacent cutting inclinations. These cases resulted in FoS errors of 20\u201340%. Instead, linear interpolation of cutting inclinations across GSI results in FoS errors of 1\u201330%; and always reduces error relative to the use of an adjacent class. This suggests that interpolating between GSI values consistently improves the cutting inclination guidance where GSI lies between the categories.\nUnfortunately it is not possible to linearly interpolate cutting inclinations between hardness categories since they incorporate multiple parameters (UCS, \u03b3 and m\n\ni\n) and these are not linearly spaced between categories nor are they guaranteed to follow the same functional form.\n\n\n4.4\nGlobal guidelines\nIn comparing the Nepali and Ethiopian guidelines the uncertainty between the tables is relatively small compared to the uncertainties within a table. This raises the question of whether a single global table would be more beneficial. With a universal table, less work would have to be carried out and the guidelines become more widely applicable. However, we have only compared two locations here, and there are many rock types that are not included in these two tables. Wider geographic applicability necessitates inclusion of a wider range of geomaterials, and associated parameter values and thus larger uncertainties.\n\n\n4.5\nLimitations of the guidelines\nOur guidelines are not suitable for cuttings that are made up of layers of different rock types as the cutting material modelled was homogeneous except for the PLM. Where material strength varies with elevation, cuttings may need to accommodate multiple profiles at different inclinations.\nAs discussed in Section 2.1 there is general consensus that D should decrease with depth into the slope. Following the recommendation of Hoek (2012), we incorporated D into our slope models using a PLM. However, a disadvantage of the PLM approach, is that it creates a stepwise strength profile that tends to bound failure at the boundary between planes (as discussed in Section 3.4). In addition, the majority of literature surrounding D is on open-pit mining or tunneling (Hoek et al., 2002; Hoek and Brown, 2019) and, therefore, the size of the PLM zone used in this study is an assumption based on the small amount of literature available for the size of the D zone in road cuttings (Matheson, 1995; Yang et al., 2020).\nThe guidelines here produced are not suitable to design cuttings in the presence of dominant structural orientations and\/or significant anisotropy of the rock mass shear strength. To introduce structural dominance to the guidelines would add unwanted complexity in their development and use. To assess the stability of cuttings controlled by distinct discontinuities, stereographical projections can be used to map the failure kinematics whilst the Discrete Element Method can be used to assess slope stability (e.g. Boon et al. (2014)). Hearn (2011) also outline the conditions which need to be satisfied for discontinuities to cause planar failure in rock slopes.\nAnother key limitation of our methodology is due to the stability analyses being performed for dry slopes. Most slopes and cuttings will experience some seepage due to periods of rainfall, especially in locations that host monsoon seasons. However, we chose this assumption due to the fact that the position of the phreatic line in a slope is hard to postulate given variable rainfall rate and the large scatter of values exhibited by hydrological parameters. To deal with this limitation, rather than introducing unrealistic seepage conditions, as unfortunately is the case with many stability charts in the literature, we conducted seepage analyses to identify the range of slope saturation conditions for which our guidelines are applicable. We acknowledge there are slope saturation scenarios that the guidelines are less reliable in dealing with.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThis paper provided two key contributions: (1) a new methodology that can be used to develop user-friendly and rigorous guidelines for road cuttings in LIC\/LMIC and (2) a set of guidelines for road cuttings in Nepal. The Nepal guidelines are more robust than guidelines currently provided in manuals and they are in close agreement with published stability charts. This methodology offers transparency, meaning that they can be easily adapted and that the level of uncertainty can be tuned to fit the users needs. We showed that our guidelines provide a user-friendly tool for practitioners tasked with the design of cuttings and the assessment of their stability.\nIn the process of developing the guidelines and through our analysis of the resulting tables, we have found that the greatest care needs to be taken in designing cuttings in weak material as they are most sensitive to the choices that a practitioner makes, having the largest input uncertainties. In addition, the weaker categories in our guidelines are more sensitive to seepage. We found that inclined upslope topography has only a minor impact on cutting stability. Further stability analyses demonstrated that interpolation improves predictions for cutting heights and GSI values that sit between classes, but cannot be used between hardness categories. In addition, the uncertainty between the same entries in tables for different locations (Nepal and Ethiopia) was relatively small compared to that between adjacent entries in the table for a single location. This introduces the possibility of a single set of globally applicable guidelines, though the reliability and usability of such guidelines remains an open research question.\nWe suggest that practitioners could use our guidelines to quickly and efficiently determine a suitable cutting inclination based on some key observations (rock state and hardness, and excavation type) and desired cutting characteristics (cutting height and Factor of Safety). These guidelines should be used as a first step in the design of cuttings and help assessing the stability of existing cuttings. We believe they can produce a step change in the safety of road construction in LIC\/LMIC.\n\n","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nRainfall-induced landslides pose a serious threat to lives and properties around the world. The mountainous country Nepal experiences widespread landslides every year triggered by the concentrated monsoonal rainfall between June and September (Dahal and Hasegawa, 2008; Petley et al., 2007; Upreti and Dhital, 1996). The monsoonal rainfall constitutes ~80% of the total annual rainfall and studies show that >90% of the fatal landslides in Nepal occur during this period (Froude and Petley, 2018; NDRRMA, 2021; Petley et al., 2007). In the last decade, landslides caused the loss of over 1200 lives and economic damage of more than $14 million in Nepal (NDRRMA, 2021).\nThe proliferation of informal local roads in Nepal has further increased the risk of rainfall-induced landsliding (Dahal et al., 2010; Devkota et al., 2014; Froude and Petley, 2018; Mcadoo et al., 2018; Petley et al., 2007; Vuillez et al., 2018), and this has been attributed to the non-engineered or informal method of slope excavation for road construction, often crossing terrain with steep angles, without suitable planning, design and drainage and protection measures (Dixit et al., 2021; Hearn and Shakya, 2017; Robson et al., 2021; UNDP, 2011; World Bank, 2012). The study by Mcadoo et al. (2018) found that the rainfall-triggered landslides could occur with approximately twice the frequency in areas with poorly constructed roads than in those without, based on the spatial distribution analysis of landslides and roads in Sindhupalchok district, Nepal. Vuillez et al. (2018) also found that within the Phewa watershed in western Nepal, the occurrence of landslides during extreme rainfall events was more prominent in areas intersected by or in close vicinity of the roads.\nAlthough the association between rainfall, road construction and landslides in Nepal has been recognised anecdotally (Dahal et al., 2010; Rosser et al., 2021) and broadly correlated statistically by previous studies (Petley et al., 2007), there is limited understanding related to the physical process by which road cuts influence slope stability during rainfall. The necessity to model this physical process to better understand the combined road-rainfall effect on landsliding has also been emphasised by Mcadoo et al. (2018). Moreover, the need to address landslides related to roads and rainfall extends beyond Nepal to other low- and middle-income countries, where the construction of non-engineered steep slopes as part of road building is common and is known to be a dominant driver of instability (Haigh and Rawat, 2012; Holcombe et al., 2016; Sati et al., 2011; Sidle et al., 2014; UNDP, 2011; Sidle and Ziegler, 2012).\nAssessing the physical process of the rainfall-triggered landslides requires understanding how the transient atmospheric process like rainfall influences the unsaturated soil behaviour near the ground surface (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). Rainfall infiltration into the unsaturated zone is known to cause an increase in the soil water content, and reductions in soil suction and shear strength (Brand, 1981; Fredlund, 1987; Godt et al., 2009; Lumb, 1975; Rahardjo et al., 2019; Springman et al., 2003; Tsaparas et al., 2002). The infiltration-induced pore water pressure changes modify the soil stresses, which causes soil deformation, and soil deformation, in turn, modifies the seepage process because the key hydraulic properties like permeability, porosity, and water retention capacity of soil change with the changes in stresses (Song and Borja, 2014; Zhang et al., 2018). Hence, the analysis of the physical process of rainfall-triggered landslides requires powerful numerical modelling methods that can model not only the transient atmospheric conditions but also the interdependence between seepage and stress-deformation in unsaturated soils.\nThe coupled hydro-mechanical analysis effectively captures this interdependence by allowing simultaneous computation of both hydraulic and mechanical responses of variably saturated soils, which is necessary for the accurate assessment of rainfall-induced landslides (Chen et al., 2018; Hamdhan and Schweiger, 2013; Laloui et al., 2016; Md Rahim and Toll, 2014; Qi and Vanapalli, 2015; Yang et al., 2017, 2019; Yubonchit et al., 2017). Compared to the uncoupled analyses, where the hydraulic and mechanical aspects of soil behaviour are treated separately, the coupled hydro-mechanical analyses have been reported to provide a better prediction of factor of safety and the pore water pressure predictions from coupled analyses have been found to be in good agreement with field-measured pore water pressures (Hamdhan and Schweiger, 2013; Toll et al., 2019). Studies have also shown that the coupled analyses can closely predict actual failure times, in addition to providing a better prediction of seepage and stress distribution (Rahim, 2016; Oh and Lu, 2015; Yang et al., 2017, 2020, 2019).\nThus, addressing the need to understand the physical process of landslides triggered by the combined effect of rainfall and road cut in Nepal, and considering the advantages of the coupled hydro-mechanical analyses, this study utilises the hydro-mechanical approach to investigate a case study of a rainfall-induced landslide on a road cut slope in Sindhupalchok district, Nepal. Using this case study, this paper aims to 1) back-analyse the landslide to understand the underlying mechanism and physical processes involved in the failure and 2) quantitatively assess the effect of the road cut on the occurrence of the landslide during rainfall. Through a series of numerical analyses, this study also attempts to demonstrate the viability of coupled hydro-mechanical analyses to capture the hydrological changes in unsaturated soils due to soil-atmospheric interaction and to predict the occurrence of slope failures. As hydro-mechanical modelling requires a good understanding of the relevant physical, mechanical, and hydraulic soil parameters, comprehensive field and laboratory testing of the soils were conducted during this study. The field and laboratory data were used to define the input material properties for numerical modelling. A field hydrological monitoring program was also undertaken at the study site after the landslide, and the monitored data was utilised to calibrate the numerical model.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\nThe investigated landslide is located in Kanglang village in the Upper Bhote Koshi valley of Sindhupalchok district, Province 3, Nepal (hereafter referred to as the Kanglang landslide) (Fig. 1a). During the widening of the local road from Daklang to Listi (Fig. 1b), the slope was informally excavated to a steep ~70\u00b0 cut in December 2017 (Fig. 1c). It is common for slopes to be excavated at steep angles during the construction of local roads to minimise earthwork volumes and associated costs (Hearn, 2011). During the following monsoon in July 2018, a translational slide (Varnes, 1958) occurred, affecting a larger area above the road cut (Fig. 1d). With ~1.5\u00a0m depth of the sliding surface, the landslide can be categorised as a shallow translational slide. The length and width of the landslide are approximately 25\u00a0m (upslope), and 45\u00a0m (along slope) respectively. The sliding soil body generally follows Northeast direction, extending from an elevation of 1440\u00a0m (toe) m to 1460\u00a0m (crown) above sea level (a.s.l.). The elevations were recorded using a hand-held GPS (Garmin 60CSx) which provides an approximate estimation of the elevation with an accuracy of <10\u00a0m. Although the exact timing of the landslide is not known, the landowner noted that the landslide occurred before 16 July 2018.\nThe study area receives an average of 3599\u00a0mm of rainfall annually, the second-highest rainfall in Nepal (Karki et al., 2016), based on the 64-year rainfall record (1955\u20132018) obtained from the nearest weather station in Gumthang, located ~6.3\u00a0km from the study site (DHM, 2018). The topography of the region is rugged with steep slopes, narrow gorges and high relief with altitudes ranging from 760 to 4100\u00a0m (Tanoli et al., 2017). Geologically, the Kanglang landslide is underlain by a thick colluvial deposit with a mix of gravel-, cobble-, and boulder-sized materials, and is situated near the mid-section of a hillslope which could be an ancient landslide deposit (Fig. 1b). Such deposits encountered on the mountain slopes are formed by progressive downslope transport of materials from gravity-driven mass movement or hill wash processes (Hearn, 2011). The study site is approximately 7.4\u00a0km south of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and the region south of MCT is dominated by sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks including shale, sandstone, limestone, dolomite, slate, phyllite, schist, and quartzite (Upreti, 2001). The majority of the Daklang-Listi road, including the Kanglang landslide, traverses through the Lakharpata formation (DMG, 1994), which includes Malekhu Limestone, Benighat Slate, and Dhading Dolomites of the Upper Nuwakot unit (St\u00f6cklin, 1980; Upreti, 1996). During the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal, Sindhupalchok district was severely affected by a large number of co-seismic landslides (Kincey et al., 2021; Roback et al., 2018). The consequent post-earthquake landslide activities in this region have been reported to have remained active and evolving by recent studies (Kincey et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2020). Due to the combination of heavy rainfall, rugged topography, proximity to the tectonic fault, post-earthquake landslide activity, as well as ongoing anthropogenic activities like road-building (Mcadoo et al., 2018; Rosser et al., 2021), the study area is susceptible to both natural and anthropogenic landslides.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThere are three key steps in the adopted methodology. First is the detailed geotechnical field investigation, where borehole drilling, standard penetration tests (SPTs), and trial pit excavation were conducted near the landslide crown to investigate and reconstruct the subsoil condition of the slope before the landslide. Soil samples were obtained from the borehole and trial pit for geotechnical characterisation and estimation of their mechanical (shear strength parameters) and hydraulic soil properties (SWRCs and saturated permeability). A detailed description of the methods and results of the field and laboratory testing are presented in section 5. Second is the field monitoring program conducted to assess the in-situ hydrologic changes in the soil using real-time measurements of rainfall and volumetric water content of the soil (section 6). Finally, in the third step, using the estimated soil parameters, the failed slope was reconstructed and a series of hydro-mechanical analyses (or fully coupled flow-deformation analysis) was performed in the finite element code PLAXIS 2D (Bentley Systems Inc., 2018), as illustrated in Fig. 2\n.\nThe first part of the numerical analysis- model calibration, constituted a hydro-mechanical analysis, where the monitored rainfall in July 2019 was imposed as a hydraulic boundary at the ground surface (Fig. 2). The predicted volumetric water content responses were compared to the in-situ volumetric water content measurements to calibrate the numerical model. Since the hydrological conditions of the slope are not known when the landslide occurred, model calibration is the crucial first step necessary to make reliable predictions of the slope behaviour under different rainfall scenarios. As shown in Fig. 2, the calibrated model was adopted for the subsequent analyses to 1) evaluate the stability of the slope from the time when the road cut was excavated in December 2017 to June 2018, before the Kanglang landslide to check if the slope is predicted to remain stable before the main landsliding event in July 2018 (stability analysis before the Kanglang landslide), 2) back-analyse and predict the failure timing and mechanism of the Kanglang landslide (back-analysis of Kanglang landslide), and 3) investigate the influence of the road cut by replicating the back-analysis on an idealised slope model without the road cut, which was subjected to the same rainfall conditions that triggered the Kanglang landslide (slope stability analysis without road cut). The numerical analyses from (1) to (3) were conducted by combining the hydro-mechanical analysis with the safety analysis to estimate the factor of safety (FOS) at different time steps (Fig. 2).\n\n\n4\nTheoretical background\n\n4.1\nCoupled hydro-mechanical analysis\nPLAXIS 2D was adopted in this study given its proven ability to assess the hydro-mechanical behaviour of slopes under transient hydraulic boundary conditions (Hamdhan and Schweiger, 2013). The formulation of the coupled hydro-mechanical analysis in PLAXIS is based on Biot's 3-dimensional consolidation theory (Biot, 1941), which combines the equilibrium equation and the continuity equation of the soil-water matrix (Galavi, 2010; Galavi et al., 2009). This allows computation of both deformation and groundwater seepage simultaneously under steady and transient flow boundaries in both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions (Galavi, 2010; Galavi et al., 2009). In the coupled formulation in PLAXIS, the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soil is modelled using Bishop's effective stress concept, where the net stress and suction components are combined into single effective stress, as shown in Eq. (1) (Bishop, 1959). Under this concept, the suction coefficient \u03c7 is related to the degree of saturation and can be considered as a scaling parameter determining the contribution of matric suction to the shear strength of the unsaturated soil. In PLAXIS, \u03c7 is considered equivalent to the effective degree of saturation, and the pore air pressure is assumed to be negligible (Eq. (2)).\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c3\n'\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n\nu\na\n\n\n\n+\n\u03c7\n\n\n\nu\na\n\n\u2212\n\nu\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03c3\n'\n\n=\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n\nS\ne\n\n\nu\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nS\ne\n\n=\n\n\nS\n\u2212\n\nS\nr\n\n\n\n\nS\ns\n\n\u2212\n\nS\nr\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c3\n' are the total and effective stresses respectively, u\n\na\n and u\n\nw\n are the pore air and pore water pressures respectively, (\u03c3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0u\n\na\n) is the net normal stress, \u03c7 is the suction coefficient, (u\n\na\n\u00a0\u2212\u00a0u\n\nw\n) is the matric suction and S, S\n\ne\n, S\n\nr\n, and S\n\ns\n denote the degree of saturation, effective degree of saturation, degree of saturation at residual state and degree of saturation at fully saturated state, respectively.\nIt is recognised that studies have questioned the suitability of Bishop's effective stress concept, particularly the consideration of the suction coefficient (\u03c7) being a function of the degree of saturation (Fredlund et al., 1978; Jennings and Burland, 1962; Khalili and Khabbaz, 1998). However, the use of Bishop's effective stress for modelling unsaturated soil behaviour allows an easier transition between unsaturated and saturated states and studies have provided evidence of its validity, which includes one of the earliest experimental studies by Bishop and Blight (1963) on clayey soils. Toll (2020) also showed that Bishop's effective stress concept is valid for clayey soils when the degree of saturation is \u226575%. For non-clayey soils, \u00d6berg and S\u00e4llfors (1997) found that the \u03c7-parameter can be replaced by the degree of saturation when it is greater than ~50%. In agreement with this study, Alonso et al. (2010) and Casini et al. (2011) found that the unsaturated soil behaviour, particularly for granular soils like sands and silts, can be expressed using a single Bishop's effective stress. Hence, whilst the Bishop's effective stress concept may not be valid for all soil types, at all ranges of saturation (Toll et al., 2019), it is reasonable to assume that for non-clayey soils, this concept can provide a realistic prediction of the unsaturated soil behaviour, particularly when the degree of saturation is high and the air phase is discontinuous, as would be the case in the modelling of rainfall-induced landslides.\nAs for the hydraulic behaviour of unsaturated soil in PLAXIS, the van Genuchten model (van Genuchten, 1980) was used. Based on this model, the relationship between matric suction and volumetric water content of the soil is expressed as Eq. (4) and the permeability function can be expressed as Eq. (5).\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03b8\ne\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n\u03b1\u03c8\n\nn\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\nk\n=\n\nk\ns\n\n\nk\nr\n\n=\n\nk\ns\n\n\n\n\u03b8\ne\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b8\ne\n\n\n1\n\/\nm\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nWhere\u00a0\u03b8\u00a0is the volumetric water content,\u00a0\u03b8\n\ne\n\u00a0is the normalised volumetric water content,\u00a0\u03b8\n\nr\n and\u00a0\u03b8\n\ns\n are the volumetric water contents at residual and fully saturated states respectively,\u00a0\u03c8 is the matric suction head,\u00a0k, k\n\ns\n\u00a0and\u00a0k\n\nr\n denote the coefficient of permeability, saturated coefficient of permeability and relative permeability, respectively, and\u00a0\u03b1,\u00a0n,\u00a0m\u00a0and\u00a0l\u00a0are the curve fitting parameters where\u00a0m\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u2212\u00a01\/n.\n\n\n4.2\nSafety analysis\nThe safety analysis in PLAXIS uses the strength-reduction method to determine the factor of safety (Brinkgreve et al., 2018). Assuming a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, this method entails an incremental reduction of the shear strength parameters (cohesion and angle of shearing resistance) by a strength reduction factor until the slope reaches a failure state (Cai and Ugai, 2004; Griffiths and Lane, 1999; Matsui and San, 1992). The factor of safety is defined as the ratio of the shear strength parameters of soil to those at failure as shown in Eq.

The subscript \u2018failure' denotes the shear strength parameters at failure.\n\n\n\n5\nDetailed investigation of subsoil condition and soil properties\n\n5.1\nSubsoil condition\nTo assess the subsoil condition, a borehole was drilled using rotary drilling next to the landslide crown (Fig. 1e). During drilling, boulder- and cobble-size materials were encountered at 5.8 and 6.3\u00a0m depths, typical for colluvial soils. SPTs were conducted in the borehole in accordance with BS EN ISO22476-3 (BSI, 2005) at 1\u00a0m intervals to a maximum depth of 7\u00a0m. At 7\u00a0m, the SPT sampler was replaced by a solid 60\u00b0 cone (SPT (cone)) to prevent damage to the sampler by the coarser materials, as recommended in BS 5930: 2015 (BSI, 2015). The number of blows required for 300\u00a0mm penetration with the cone was converted to the corresponding SPT N-value using the correlation proposed by Mohan et al. (1970). The SPTs revealed a uniform deposit of medium dense soil from 0 to 7\u00a0m with corrected SPT values ((N1)60) ranging from 11 to 19 (with a mean of 14) (Fig. 3\n). The soil samples extracted from the upper 2, 4 and 5\u00a0m exhibited reddish-brown colour and sandy to silty texture, and below 6\u00a0m, the soil was brownish grey with a sandy texture. Based on the correlation with SPT proposed by Hatanaka and Uchida (1996), the angle of shearing resistance of the soil was estimated to range from 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 (37\u00b0 on average) and the elastic modulus of soil was estimated to be between 6 and 8\u00a0MPa, based on the empirical correlation given by Bowles (1997).\nTo obtain disturbed and undisturbed samples, a trial pit (1.5\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0\u00a0m) was excavated to 1.5\u00a0m depth as per BS ISO 18400-102:2017 (BSI, 2017) (Fig. 1e). The materials excavated from the trial pit were predominantly fine-grained and indicated the presence of silty and sandy soils. Within the trial pit, the upper 0.25\u00a0m layer exhibited a slightly different greyish-brown colour, as shown in Fig. 4\n which could be due to weathering and presence of organic matter. Below this layer, the soil was described as slightly wet, reddish-brown sandy to silty soil. From the trial pit, disturbed bag samples were collected, and core samples were obtained using open-ended steel sampling tubes (\u03d5 37\u00a0mm), which were driven into the bottom of the trial pit at 0.5, 1, and 1.5\u00a0m depths. After extracting the cores, the open ends were sealed with paraffin wax and wrapped in cling film to minimise moisture loss during transport. With permission from the Department of Mines and Geology, Kathmandu, Nepal, all the samples were exported to Durham University, UK for testing.\n\n\n5.2\nSoil properties\n\nTable 1\n presents a summary of the in-situ physical properties of the core samples obtained from the trial pit. The particle size distributions were obtained using the commercial laser diffraction particle size analyser (LS 13320) with a measurement range from 0.04\u00a0\u03bcm to 2\u00a0mm. The soil samples contained \u226412% clay-sized particles, while silt- and sand-sized particles dominated the distribution (SILT to Sandy SILT as per BS 5930:2015 (BSI, 2015)). The samples obtained from the borehole also contained low clay contents \u22648% and higher percentages of silt-sized particles (43 to 70%). The Atterberg limits were determined as per BS EN ISO 17892-12:2018 (BSI, 2018a), where the finer fraction (<0.425\u00a0mm) of the soil samples from shallow depths (<1\u00a0m) exhibited intermediate plasticity with the plasticity index from 14 to 17% and liquid limit from 37 to 40%. The lower plasticity index and smaller clay fraction suggest a lower potential for swelling and shrinkage due to changes in water contents. Further, the sample near the ground surface was found to be relatively loose with a higher void ratio that decreased with increasing depth. The degree of saturation increased with depth, confirming the observation of a wetter soil layer below 0.5\u00a0m within the trial pit (Fig. 4).\nA series of consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial compression tests were performed according to BS EN ISO 17892-9:2018 (BSI, 2018b) to estimate the shear strength parameters of the soil. The tests were performed on reconstituted soil samples obtained from 0.5 to 0.75\u00a0m depth. The samples were compacted in the laboratory to a dry density of 1.34\u00a0Mg\/m3 corresponding to the in-situ dry density of the undisturbed soil sample obtained from 0.5\u00a0m depth (Table 1). Based on the results shown in terms of the stress path plotted in the two-dimensional p\u2019 (mean effective stress) and q (deviator stress) space (Fig. 5\n), the critical angle of shearing resistance was estimated to be 36\u00b0 (slope of the critical state line M\u00a0=\u00a01.47), which is much lower than the road cut slope angle at the investigated site (~70\u00b0). The estimated angle of shearing resistance is comparable to the empirical estimation of 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 corresponding to the SPT (N1)60 values, as per Hatanaka and Uchida (1996). There is some evidence of a cohesive component of strength from the tests carried out at confining stresses of 25 and 75\u00a0kPa, and the strength envelope shown in Fig. 5 represents a lower bound strength envelope.\nThe saturated coefficient of permeability was determined using the standard triaxial constant head permeability test as per BS EN ISO 17892-11:2019 (BSI, 2019). The test was performed by consolidating the saturated sample at 100, 200 and 300\u00a0kPa and measuring the flow through the sample at each consolidation pressure. A constant water pressure difference of 20\u00a0kPa was maintained to allow flow from the top to the bottom of the sample. At increasing levels of the effective consolidation pressure, the saturated permeability of the soil sample was found to range from 1.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 and 1.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s, typical for silts and silty sands (Lu and Likos, 2004).\nThe soil-water retention curves (SWRCs) were obtained using discrete or staged drying and wetting methods as described by Louren\u00e7o et al. (2007). The soil suction was measured using the high capacity tensiometer developed at Durham University, known for its fast response rate and high suction measurements up to 2\u00a0MPa (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2006; Toll et al., 2013). Direct measurement of suction using tensiometers avoids the calibration errors that may be inevitable in other indirect suction measurement methods (Louren\u00e7o et al., 2006; Toll et al., 2013). During the test, the samples were dried and wetted in stages and were left to equalise for at least 24\u00a0h in an insulated setting before measuring suction. After equalisation, suction was measured, and volumetric measurements of the samples were made using a digital calliper with \u00b10.01\u00a0mm accuracy. This process was repeated to define both the drying and wetting SWRCs. The wetting SWRC was obtained by air-drying the sample to <1.5% water content before wetting back up to define the primary wetting curve. The wetting-scanning curve was obtained by wetting the sample from the end of the drying phase at a volumetric water content of ~20%. Fig. 6a and b illustrate the SWRCs of the tested samples fitted to the van Genuchten model (VG model) (van Genuchten, 1980) (Eq. (4)). The resulting curves exhibited hysteretic behaviour during drying and wetting where the wetting-scanning curve obtained by wetting the sample after the end of the drying stage reaches the primary wetting curve. The curve fitting parameters for the van Genuchten model are also shown in Fig. 6a and b.\n\n\n\n6\nField monitoring program\nDuring this study, a field monitoring station was established \u223c10\u00a0m west of the landslide crown as shown in Fig. 1e. Three 10HS soil moisture sensors (S-SMx-M005) (ONSET, 2018) were installed horizontally at depths of 0.3, 0.8, and 1.2\u00a0m on the undisturbed vertical wall of the trial pit to measure the changes in volumetric water content of the soil. The first sensor was installed at 0.3\u00a0m to capture the immediate volumetric water content responses while avoiding the upper layers where the plant roots could create preferential flow paths. Below this depth, the sensors were installed at vertical spacings of 0.4 to 0.5\u00a0m. The monitoring station was equipped with a rain gauge (HOBO\u00ae S-RGB-M002) (ONSET, 2018) and a data logger and telemetry system (HOBO RX3000) (ONSET, 2019) was installed to record and remotely retrieve the rainfall and volumetric water content measurements. A detailed description of the monitoring station setup is presented by Pradhan et al. (2020).\n\n\n7\nNumerical model set-up\n\n7.1\nGeometry\n\nFig. 7a shows the simplified 2-dimensional plane strain model of the investigated slope before the Kanglang landslide. The finite element mesh consisted of 3399 15-noded triangular elements and 27,515 nodes. A finer mesh was defined closer to the ground surface as higher deformation is expected in this part of the model. Additionally, the finer mesh near the ground surface was crucial to obtain a refined prediction of the volumetric water content changes during model calibration, given the vertical spacing between the 10HS sensors in the field was relatively small (0.4 to 0.5\u00a0m). At greater depths, the mesh size was increased to reduce computational time. Similarly, for the slope stability analysis without the road cut, a 2-dimensional plane strain model representing an idealised undisturbed hillslope was created with a finite element mesh consisting of 3623 triangular elements and 29,303 nodes (Fig. 7b). The specification of the mesh was kept identical to that in Fig. 7a so that the resulting factor of safety was comparable between the two models.\n\n\n7.2\nMaterial parameters\n\nTable 2\n presents the summary of the input soil parameters adopted in the numerical analyses. The four soil layers defined in Table 2, also shown in Fig. 7a and b were differentiated based on their hydraulic soil properties. The rationale for this layering was to capture the different hydrologic responses of the soils observed at the three measured depths of 0.3, 0.8, and 1.2\u00a0m during field monitoring, which are related mainly to the differences in their hydraulic properties (Fig. 8a, b and c). As the permeability tests in the laboratory were conducted at higher effective confining pressures (section 5.2), the saturated permeabilities of soil layers at shallow depths were estimated by extrapolating the measured relationship between saturated permeability and effective confining pressures. Further, weathering and plant roots create non-capillary macropores and surficial cracks near the ground surface, which results in a higher in-situ permeability than that measured in the laboratory (Collison et al., 1995; Dixon et al., 2019). To incorporate such effects within the numerical models, Toll et al. (2019) and Gasmo et al. (2000) introduced a surficial soil layer with a higher vertical permeability than the laboratory-measured value. Rouainia et al. (2009) also found a good agreement between model predictions and field-measured pore water pressures when the measured soil permeability was increased by one to two orders of magnitude. In this study, to consider the macroscopic effects near the ground, two times higher permeability than the estimated value was assigned to the top layer from 0 to 0.5\u00a0m, which provided a good agreement between predicted and measured volumetric water content responses, which is discussed further in section 8.1.\nWith regards to the SWRCs, it is debated in the literature whether the wetting or drying SWRC should be implemented for rainfall-induced slope stability analyses when hydraulic hysteresis cannot be taken into account. Considering infiltration corresponds closely to soil wetting, it is rational to adopt the wetting SWRC, which has also been suggested by Kristo et al. (2019) and Kim et al. (2018). Li et al. (2005) also found a closer match between field-measured SWRC and the wetting SWRC obtained from testing. Hence, as hydraulic hysteresis cannot be modelled in PLAXIS, in all the numerical analyses presented in this study, the wetting SWRC parameters were adopted to model the hydraulic soil behaviour in both the drying and wetting phases. An exception to this is the stability analysis before the Kanglang landslide (Fig. 2), which included a prolonged dry period from 1 December 2017 to 28 February 2018, with only a few days of non-zero rainfall (Fig. 9a). For this period, the drying SWRC was used to model the hydraulic behaviour and after the end of this dry period, from 1 March to 30 June 2018, the wetting SWRC parameters were assigned to the soil layers to model infiltration. The drying and wetting SWRCs for layers 1 and 2 shown in Table 2 were measured in the laboratory (Fig. 6a and b). The value of g\n\na\n for the lower layers (layers 3 and 4) was adjusted to match the initial volumetric water content in the model to that measured in the field at 1.2\u00a0m. As the air-entry value tends to increase with the increase in normal stress and decrease in the void ratio (Miller et al., 2008), a lower value of g\n\na\n than the upper layers can be considered to be a reasonable assumption.\nThe conventional Mohr-Coulomb model was used to represent the constitutive relationship of all soil layers defined in Table 2. Since a uniform subsoil profile was revealed by the SPT results (Fig. 3) and a similarly uniform subsoil was exposed inside the trial pit with only a noticeable change in colour due to weathering and wetness (Fig. 4), the shear strength properties estimated from the laboratory (Fig. 5) were considered to be uniform. Since the samples did not exhibit a distinctive peak but showed a contractive behaviour indicated by the increase in pore water pressures under undrained conditions, which is typical for loose or normally consolidated soils (OCR ~1) (Fig. 5), the angle of shearing resistance at the critical state was adopted for modelling. As the silt-sized particles dominate the particle size distribution of the soils at shallow depths (Table 1), a residual state created due to clay particles aligning within the shear zone would not be expected (Skempton, 1985). Although at the critical state, the effective cohesion is negligible, a small value of cohesion (3\u00a0kPa) was assigned to prevent numerical instabilities mainly near the ground surface where the effective stresses are lower. A smaller value of cohesion predicted localised failure near the steep face of the cut slope, which essentially was modelling surface ravelling, and this prevented the analysis of a deeper failure from proceeding further. A small cohesion of 3\u00a0kPa could be justified by the evidence of a cohesive element of strength indicated by the triaxial tests at lower stress levels, which would be relevant for shallow slope failures.\n\n\n7.3\nBoundary conditions\nOn both slope models shown in Fig. 7a and b, standard fixities were applied, which allowed vertical movement of the two lateral boundaries, free movement of the upper boundary and restrained movement of the bottom boundary. The hydraulic boundaries at the two lateral sides of the model were set to be closed and the bottom boundary was assigned as an open boundary. On the upper model boundaries, a downward positive flux was prescribed to model infiltration, the input values of which are the actual rainfall amounts specified in the unit of length per unit of time. Similarly, to simulate evapotranspiration during the periods with zero rainfall, on the upper model boundaries, an upward negative flux of 0.167\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0m\/h or 4\u00a0mm\/day was applied based on the study by Lambert and Chitrakar (1989).\nFor the model calibration, hourly rainfall from 1 July to 11 July 2019 recorded at the monitoring station was applied as positive influx. For the analysis of slope stability before the Kanglang landslide failure, due to lack of access to continuous hourly records, daily rainfall from 1 December 2017 to 30 June 2018 measured at the four nearest rainfall stations located between ~6 and 27\u00a0km from the study site was obtained from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Nepal (DHM, 2018). Based on these distances, a weighted mean daily rainfall was estimated and prescribed as influx. The back-analysis of the Kanglang landslide and the stability analysis without the road cut were conducted under the July 2018 hourly rainfall recorded at Bahrabise located approximately 11\u00a0km south of the study site.\nThe infiltration amount varies with time and depends on the infiltration capacity of the soil, which is governed largely by the permeability function shown in Eq. (5) (Galavi, 2010). In PLAXIS, if the rainfall intensity is greater than this capacity, ponding occurs at the surface at a prescribed depth of \u03c8\n\nmax\n, which is the water head above the ground surface. If this is exceeded, runoff is simulated. For simplicity, it was assumed that ponding does not occur on sloping ground; hence a small value of maximum pore water pressure head (\u03c8\n\nmax\n) of 0.1\u00a0mm was assigned on the upper surface boundaries. To prevent unrealistic suction development due to evapotranspiration, a minimum pressure head (\u03c8\n\nmin\n) of \u221230\u00a0m was prescribed at the upper surface boundaries. This value corresponds to the minimum volumetric water content of 0.23\u00a0m3\/m3 recorded at 0.3\u00a0m depth during a year-long monitoring period from 27 March 2019 to 28 March 2020.\n\n\n7.4\nInitial conditions\nThe initial stresses were generated using the gravity loading function in PLAXIS, which is recommended for sloping ground (Brinkgreve et al., 2018). With this loading function, PLAXIS generates initial stresses by the application of soil self-weight. The groundwater table was assumed to be 15\u00a0m below the upper model boundary as shown in Fig. 7a and b. The initial pore water pressures were generated by applying a constant influx of 3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m\/s at the ground surface for five years until a steady-state condition was attained where no further change in the pore water pressure with time was observed. After a steady-state condition was reached, actual rainfall was applied as a downward positive influx and an upward negative flux was applied to simulate evapotranspiration at the ground surface.\n\n\n\n8\nResults\n\n8.1\nModel calibration\nThe calibration results presented in Fig. 8a, b and c illustrate the comparisons between predicted and measured hourly volumetric water content changes. Since PLAXIS does not produce direct output as volumetric water content, the soil suction predicted by PLAXIS from the fully coupled analysis was converted to volumetric water content using the wetting SWRC. Fig. 8a and b show that at 0.3 and 0.8\u00a0m depths, the model predicted a slightly higher increase in volumetric water content during rainfall. At 0.3\u00a0m, the starting volumetric water content in the model was ~0.01\u00a0m3\/m3 higher than that in the field. At 1.2\u00a0m depth, the predicted volumetric water content was found to be in close agreement with the field measurement, as shown in Fig. 8c. The discrepancies between model prediction and field measurement may have resulted from soil heterogeneity, the use of a single wetting SWRC to convert the predicted suction to volumetric water content and hydraulic hysteresis that was not incorporated in PLAXIS. Nonetheless, it is evident that the model effectively captured the overall trend of the volumetric water content changes at all depths. The model also accurately predicted the timing of the increase and decrease of volumetric water content at the start and end of a rainfall event. Hence, despite some discrepancies in the magnitude of the changes, given the ability of the model to closely capture the hydrologic changes in the field during this monsoonal period of the year, the calibrated model was considered suitable for the subsequent analyses.\n\n\n8.2\nSlope stability analysis before the Kanglang landslide\n\nFig. 9a and b present the results of the slope stability assessment before the Kanglang landslide from 1 December 2017 (when the slope was excavated) to 30 June 2018 (before the main landsliding event in July 2018). Fig. 9a shows that the changes in factor of safety during this period are related directly to the wet and dry phases; the wet phases being the days with non-zero rainfall. During the relatively dry period before 28 February 2018, the factor of safety increased to ~3.5. As the wetting SWRC was introduced into the model on 1 March 2018, the factor of safety dropped slightly but remained consistently high until 18 May 2018 when the daily rainfall was 12\u00a0mm or less. After 18 May 2018, the factor of safety decreased gradually with the increase in the occurrence of wet phases.\nThe decrease in the factor of safety shown in Fig. 9a due to the rainfall can be explained in terms of the changes in the effective degree of saturation and relative permeability. Fig. 9b shows that the smaller changes in the factor of safety during the dry period were because of the decreasing effective saturation and relative permeability of the soil so that rainfall infiltration is limited. With the increase in rainfall after 18 May 2018, both the effective degree of saturation and relative permeability increased gradually (Fig. 9b), allowing a greater amount of water to infiltrate into the ground and consequently leading to a drop in the factor of safety. During a few days in June 2018, the factor of safety dropped slightly below 1 but can be seen to recover after a reduction in rainfall. Although this indicates failure conditions were met, it should be noted that variations in rainfall over small distances, such as that between the site and the most local weather station may be significant here. Further, analysis using daily rainfall allows the degree of saturation of soil to rise continuously during consecutive wet days as dry periods during days considered here as \u2018wet\u2019 (e.g., hours) are not taken into consideration. Hence, the factor of safety predicted from this analysis is a conservative estimate. Taking this into consideration, it was assumed that the slope was in a stable condition from December 2017 until the end of June 2018.\n\n\n8.3\nBack-analysis of the Kanglang landslide\n\n8.3.1\nFactor of safety\nThe solid line in Fig. 10\n shows the results of the back-analysis in terms of factor of safety changes in response to rainfall from 1 July to 12 July 2018 (271\u00a0h). Six major rainfall events accumulating >5\u00a0mm rainfall were recorded, whose effects on the factor of safety are evident in Fig. 10. Before the 6th rainfall event, the factor of safety that decreased during rainfall can be seen to recover, although not fully, during the intervening dry periods. During the 6th rainfall event, however, the factor of safety decreased rapidly from 1.2 at 262nd hour (11 July 2018) to 0.97 at 267th hour (12 July 2018) and thereafter remained consistently below 1. This shows that the 6th rainfall event that had a low intensity (4.4\u00a0mm\/h) and long duration (10h) may have triggered the Kanglang landslide on 12 July 2018. Although the exact time of the actual landslide is not known, this time frame is in line with the landowner's testimony, which confirms that the developed hydro-mechanical model is capable of predicting the time of slope failure.\n\n\n8.3.2\nSoil suction and total displacements\nThe reductions in the factor of safety during the six rainfall events illustrated in Fig. 10 suggest the effect of the advancing wetting front on the overall stability of the slope. To better understand the failure mechanism, the effect of rainfall infiltration on the soil suction and total displacements were evaluated.\n\nFig. 11a and b show the changes in suction at sections A-A* and B-B* (Fig. 11c) during the 6th rainfall event from 261 to 271\u00a0h which was predicted to have triggered the Kanglang landslide (Fig. 10). Indicated by the reduction of suction with increasing cumulative rainfall, these figures reveal the gradual advancement of the wetting front near the road cut (A-A*) and mid-slope (B-B*) sections. On 12 July 2018, when the factor of safety dropped to <1 (267th hour), the wetting front advanced to ~1.3 and 1.1\u00a0m at sections A-A* and B-B* respectively. A uniform reduction of suction that is more prominent near the ground surface can also be seen in the suction contours at the time of failure (Fig. 11c). With further infiltration thereafter, the wetting front progressed to ~1.7 and 1.6\u00a0m depths at sections A-A* and B-B* respectively.\nThe advancing wetting front also resulted in increased slope displacements, as illustrated in Fig. 12a, where the direct association between rainfall and displacement can be seen in the three sections within the slope, near the road cut (C-C*), mid-slope (D-D*) and slope crest (E-E*) (Fig. 12c). Near the road cut (C-C*), larger displacements were predicted at shallow depths (\u22641.3\u00a0m), which corresponds to the depth of the wetting front at this section (~1.3\u00a0m) at the time of failure (Fig. 11a and Fig. 12a). Similarly, near the mid-slope section (D-D*) and slope crest (E-E*), larger displacements were predicted at \u22641.3\u00a0m, also corresponding to the wetting front depth of ~1.1\u00a0m when the failure occurred (Fig. 11b and Fig. 12a). Both the maximum wetting front depths (\u223c1.1 to 1.3\u00a0m) and the depths at which larger displacements were predicted by the model (\u22641.3\u00a0m) are close to the sliding depth of \u223c1.5\u00a0m estimated at the site during field investigation (section 2), which further validates the model prediction.\nFurther, relatively larger total displacements were predicted closer to the road cut compared to the other sections of the slope and the total displacements can be seen to increase non-linearly with increasing proximity to the road cut (Fig. 12c). The displacement at this section was predicted to increase to 221, 217 and 193\u00a0mm at 0, 0.3 and 0.8\u00a0m depths respectively with continued infiltration after the failure, although suction at these depths had not fully dissipated (Fig. 11a and Fig. 12b). Such large displacements despite the presence of suction suggest that the landslide was not triggered alone by the infiltration-induced loss of shear strength. Instead, the landslide was induced by a combined rainfall-road effect, where the rainfall infiltration created a weaker zone with low suction at shallow depths of \u22641.7\u00a0m above the road cut, and the presence of the steep road cut promoted the failure by allowing the upslope soil mass to slide, resulting in large displacements at the road cut. Similar results were also reported by Guadagno et al. (2003) where the authors found that the presence of discontinuities in the hillslopes created by road cuts promoted shallow landslides by imparting kinematic freedom to the upslope materials. The results of this study are also in line with the study by Holcombe et al. (2016), where the authors revealed that the slope cuttings in the hillslope can shift the failure surface towards the face of the cut, ultimately decreasing the factor of safety and causing slope failures.\n\n\n\n8.4\nStability analysis without road cut\nTo reinforce the back-analysis results which showed that the presence of the steep road cut promoted the landslide during rainfall, the back-analysis was replicated on a finite element model without the road cut (Fig. 7b), and the results in terms of factor of safety are shown by the dashed line in Fig. 10. A comparison between the two plots in Fig. 10 clearly illustrates the effect of the road cut on slope stability. The actual slope with the road cut had a\u00a0\u223c35% lesser initial factor of safety than that for the idealised, undisturbed slope without the road cut. The presence and absence of the road cut can also be seen to influence the temporal fluctuations in the factor of safety in response to the same series of rainfall events; the model without the road cut remained stable with a factor of safety close to 2.6, while in the actual slope with the road cut, the factor of safety decreased during each rainfall event before eventually dropping below 1 on 12 July 2018. At the time of failure, in comparison to the actual slope, the factor of safety of the undisturbed slope was ~170% greater. This suggests that the rainfall events that occurred before, during and after the Kanglang landslide were not sufficiently high to initiate failure in the natural or undisturbed hillslope.\nThese observations underline two key points: first, the informal modification of the natural hillslopes for road construction, creating steep road cuts, lowers the initial factor of safety by >30%, which increases the likelihood of slope failure when exposed to rainfall. Second, the observation that the undisturbed slope remained stable with ~170% higher factor of safety than the actual slope, under the same landslide-triggering rainfall events, shows that the presence of a steep road cut can lower the minimum level of rainfall needed to initiate shallow slope failure, which further aggravates the landslide susceptibility.\n\n\n8.5\nRelationship between rainfall duration and factor of safety\nThe back-analysis result presented in Fig. 10 shows that a relatively greater reduction of the factor of safety was observed during longer duration rainfall events compared to that during shorter duration rainfall events. This result was used to explore the relationship between the rainfall durations and the corresponding changes in the factor of safety. A statistically significant correlation (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.97, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was obtained (Fig. 13\n), which suggests that an increase in rainfall duration from 5 to 17\u00a0h could cause an additional ~10% drop in the factor of safety. While the correlation is based on a limited dataset, the relationship between the two variables suggests that a greater decline in the factor of safety can be expected during long-duration rainfall events compared to during shorter duration rainfall events. This observation agrees with the study by Rahardjo et al. (2007) where the authors showed that slopes with low saturated permeability (\u226410\u22126\u00a0m\/s) are less affected by short-duration rainfall events, regardless of the rainfall intensity. Such a response can be explained in terms of the infiltration-permeability ratio (I\n\nr\n\n\/k\n\nsat\n) as discussed by Tsaparas et al. (2002). In soils with low permeability, during high-intensity, short-duration rainfall events (high I\n\nr\n\/k\n\nsat\n ratio), less water can infiltrate into the ground, resulting in smaller changes to the factor of safety. On the other hand, when this ratio is smaller, as would be the case for low-intensity, longer duration rainfall events, a greater amount of water can infiltrate into the soil and influence the stability of the slope, resulting in a greater decrease in the factor of safety. As rainfall duration plays a critical role in the stability of slopes with low saturated permeability, high-intensity, long-duration rainfall events may be able to cause a relatively greater decrease in the factor of safety than low-intensity, long-duration rainfall events. However, this may also be controlled by the infiltration capacity of the soil, which partially depends on the initial conditions of the slope (Tsaparas et al., 2002).\n\n\n\n9\nDiscussion\nIn low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, roads are considered fundamental infrastructures, expected to contribute to the socio-economic development of local communities. When the poorly constructed roads become one of the landslide causative factors, the consequences present a contradiction to the primary objective of building the roads. In developing parts of the world, hillslope excavation for roads or for creating flatter sites for urbanisation has been associated with significant landslide and erosion problems (Haigh and Rawat, 2012; Holcombe et al., 2016; Sidle and Ochiai, 2006; Sidle and Ziegler, 2012). While the road networks continue to proliferate across many countries to meet the developmental goals, the need to acknowledge and address the adverse impacts of poorly constructed roads becomes more necessary than ever.\nUsing a case study of a typical landslide that occurred following a non-engineered slope excavation, the numerical analyses presented in this paper demonstrate how such activities can contribute to landsliding during rainfall. The back-analysis of the investigated landslide showed that when the failure occurred in July 2018, the rainfall infiltration in the unsaturated ground caused a gradual reduction of soil suction at shallow depths (\u22641.7\u00a0m), but not to a point where the suction dissipated completely or positive pore water pressures started to build up. Despite this the landslide occurred, which to a large extent was promoted by the presence of the road cut that allowed the weaker upslope materials with low suctions to slide, resulting in large displacements at the road cut.\nAlthough the consequences of steep slope cutting for road construction on the occurrence of rainfall-induced landslides are generally well understood and there are both supporting anecdotal and statistical evidence, the results of this study provide a valuable reference that quantifies this effect. More specifically, results show that the presence of a steep road cut on a natural hillslope could reduce the initial factor of safety by ~35%, thereby increasing the susceptibility to landsliding during rainfall. Further, the stability of the undisturbed hillslope (without road cut) under the same rainfall conditions that triggered the investigated landslide (with road cut) shows that the presence of a single road cut can lower the level of minimum rainfall needed to initiate slope failure. It is critical to recognise that a significant proportion of landslides in Nepal occurs during the monsoon when almost 80% of the annual rainfall is expected to occur. The lowering of the minimum landslide-triggering rainfall for slopes modified by road construction means that the rainfall-induced roadside slope failures will become more frequent and extensive during the monsoon if the hillslopes continue to be informally excavated without suitable engineering interventions. The proposed empirical relationship between rainfall duration and percentage decrease in factor of safety further suggests that the reduction of the factor of safety or the risk of slope failure is greater during longer duration rainfall events in modified natural hillslopes with similar soil properties as was encountered at the investigated site. The relevance of the findings of this study extends beyond the presented case study to other developing regions globally, where the road infrastructures need to be better planned and constructed, with a particular focus on minimising the risk of slope instabilities that have both short- and long-term cumulative impacts on lives, infrastructures and the environment in general.\nWhere economic constraints prevent the adoption of engineering design-based slope protection measures, cost-effective retaining structures such as dry stone and mortared masonry walls, gabion walls and crib walls that utilise locally available materials, can help prevent or mitigate roadside slope failures during rainfall (Hearn, 2011). Bio-engineering techniques such as plantation of deep-rooted plant species, turfing and jute netting are other cost-effective slope protection measures (Devkota et al., 2014). Constructing gentler roadside slopes with angles lower than the angle of shearing resistance of the soil, while adhering to the road construction guidelines e.g. DoR (2003), TRL (1997) is another simple approach that can help prevent rainfall-induced roadside slope failures.\nOn the slopes that have a high landslide potential during rainfall and pose a greater risk to lives and infrastructures, landslide prediction can prevent disasters from occurring. This study demonstrates the abilities of the coupled hydro-mechanical analysis, with Bishop's effective stress and single wetting SWRC to simulate the long-term hydrological changes in the unsaturated soils and most importantly, to predict the failure timing and failure mechanism of slopes under transient wetting and drying conditions. Application of this approach requires comprehensive site-specific field study, laboratory testing of (un)saturated soil properties and meteorological data, acquiring which may not be feasible in all conditions. This also underlines the need for quality geotechnical and meteorological data in developing countries for the prediction, prevention and mitigation of rainfall-induced landslides. Nonetheless, the lack of geotechnical data could be tackled by obtaining information through empirical estimations, published scientific literature or by utilising community knowledge and participation, as employed by Anderson and Holcombe (2013).\n\n\n10\nConclusions\nThis paper presented a case study of a typical roadside slope failure (Kanglang landslide) located in Sindhupalchok district in Nepal that was triggered by the monsoon rainfall in July 2018. An integrated approach combining detailed field investigation, laboratory testing, field monitoring and coupled flow-deformation analyses in PLAXIS 2D was used to understand the failure mechanism of the landslide and to assess the role of rainfall and road cut in inducing this failure. From the work presented in this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1.\nThe back-analysis results showed that the Kanglang landslide occurred during a low intensity (4.4\u00a0mm\/h), long duration (10\u00a0h) rainfall event on 12 July 2018, which agrees with the landowner's testimony that the failure occurred before 16 July 2018. The landslide was caused by a combined effect of rainfall and road cut where the infiltration of rainwater created a weaker zone with low suction at shallow depths of (\u22641.7\u00a0m) and the presence of the road cut promoted the failure by allowing the upslope materials to slide, resulting in large displacements of ~200\u00a0mm at the road cut.\n\n\n2.\nComparison between the two slope models representing the actual slope (with the road cut) and the idealised undisturbed slope (without the road) showed that the presence of a single steep road cut can increase the susceptibility of slope failure in two ways: first, by reducing the initial factor of safety by over 30%; and second, by lowering the minimum level of rainfall needed to initiate slope failure. This implies that the rainfall-induced roadside slope failures will become more frequent and extensive in the future if the slopes continue to be informally excavated for constructing roads or for other developmental activities.\n\n\n3.\nA statistically significant correlation was found between rainfall duration and percentage decrease in the factor of safety. This relationship suggests that in the informally excavated steep road cut slopes underlain by lower permeability SILTS and Sandy SILTS, as encountered at the investigated site, a greater reduction of the factor of safety can be expected during longer duration rainfall events; an increase in the rainfall duration from 5 to 17\u00a0h could cause an additional ~10% decrease in the factor of safety.\n\n\n4.\nUsing the measured soil properties, site geometry and rainfall records, this study demonstrates the viability of the coupled hydro-mechanical analysis to effectively capture the hydrologic changes in the soil in response to transient atmospheric conditions, and most importantly, to predict the timing of slope failure and to assess the failure mechanism of rainfall-induced slope failure. For slopes with high rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility that pose a serious risk to lives and infrastructures, landslide prediction using this approach can prevent disasters from occurring. Where hydraulic hysteresis cannot be taken into consideration in the hydro-mechanical analysis, this study also shows that the wetting soil-water retention curve can be suitably adopted to model the hydraulic behaviour of unsaturated soils.\n\n\n\nThe results from this study provide a reference for recognising the detrimental impact of informal slope cutting for road construction on the occurrence of rainfall-induced landsliding. This should be taken into consideration in future disaster mitigation and reduction strategies in areas where increasing rural access through road construction is also a priority.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nSamprada Pradhan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization.

However, geological structural discontinuities such as faults and dykes can also induce high-stress concentrations and contribute to significant dynamic failures such as coal bursts (Keneti and Sainsbury, 2018; Si et al., 2020). The response of rock mass near geological structures to mining activities can vary as the geological features have different characteristics (Abolfazlzadeh and Hudyma, 2016). To better assess dynamic failures around structural discontinuities, seismic monitoring has been widely used for quantitative seismic characterization in mines (Mutke et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2017).\nSeismic activities associated with faults have been well studied. Cheng et al. (2019) investigated fault activation at Dongjiahe longwall coal mine in China. The activation process was defined by four stages based on the distance between the fault and the longwall face. The b-value (Gutenberg and Richter, 1956) decreased as the longwall face approached and mined through the fault, indicating the stress re-distribution around the fault. Henderson et al. (1994) characterized a cluster of seismic events in the fault zone by correlating the b-value with the fractal dimension of sources. A weak positive correlation was found between these two parameters and they suggested that the correlation might be related to the pore pressure. Stec (2007) focused on mine tremors in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) in Poland and found that they correlated well with the pre-existing local faults. The source mechanism analysis revealed that mining-related tectonic tremors showed distinguished shear components, whereas the seismic events near the longwall face were more related to tensile failures. Furthermore, Mendecki et al. (2020) systematically categorized the seismic data recorded around a fold hinge zone at USCB based on the faulting mechanisms, which better depicted the stress re-distribution processes around the faults during mining for seismic hazard assessment. Le\u015bniak and Isakow (2009) installed four triaxial geophones in the Zabrze-Bielszowice mine in the USCB and identified two clusters of seismic events depicting the orientation of the faults in the mining panel. Hazard functions incorporating event energy or time intervals were developed to evaluate the relationship between specific clusters and high energy events. Cai et al. (2020) investigated the coal burst mechanism associated with faults through laboratory experiments, numerical modelling and field monitoring. They summarized that the high static stress controlled by the geological structures and the dynamic stress induced by mining both contribute to coal bursts.\nOn the other hand, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been few comprehensive studies on the detailed seismic characterization of dykes for coal burst risk assessment. Dykes were often formed in pre-existing fractures (e.g., faults and joints) as consequences of igneous intrusions (Bell, 1983). The mechanical properties of the dyke are different from those of its surrounding rocks and the dyke can influence the failure mechanisms of rock mass in its vicinity. Keneti and Sainsbury (2020) applied numerical modelling to evaluate the seismic hazard near a stiff dyke at the Palabora Mine in South Africa in the absence of seismic data. The results suggested that a stiff dyke can induce more stress concentration which can lead to sudden rock failures. The strain-burst risk near the dyke is higher. However, in-situ seismic data is required for more reliable risk prediction. In order to evaluate the stress state near major geological discontinuities, Shen et al. (2020) analyzed the stress and displacement data acquired near a dyke at an Australian longwall coal mine and correlated them with the seismic data. Numerical experiments were also conducted to investigate the effect of the dyke on the local stress conditions. The results showed that the in-situ stress has a dominant influence on the strain energy in the ribs around the dyke. The seismic data correlated well with the stress and displacement measurements.\nTo improve the understanding of the failure mechanisms associated with dykes, this study investigates the seismic evolutionary and statistical characteristics near an intrusive dyke at an underground longwall coal mine in the Gunnedah Basin, New South Wales, Australia. The temporal-spatial changes in seismicity, event locations, Es\/Ep ratio, magnitude-frequency distributions, and correlations with the released seismic energy around this intrusive structure are presented. The results showed that the dyke intensified seismic activities in its vicinity. The seismic characteristics at the inbye and outbye sides of the dyke were different and the seismic intensity changed as the longwall mining progressed. The temporal-spatial characterization of seismic multi-parameters around this major dyke provides more reliability to mines for assessing and mitigating coal burst risks near such geological discontinuities.\n\n\n2\nMonitoring site and network configurations\n\n2.1\nSite characteristics\nGunnedah Basin is in the northeast of New South Wales in Australia (Fig. 1\n) and has abundant coal resources (Tadros, 1995). Igneous intrusions (i.e., dykes and sills) have been widely found in the Permian and Triassic strata in the Gunnedah Coalfield and have affected the coal mining (Gurba and Weber, 2001). In 2017, a research project was conducted at an underground longwall coal mine in the Gunnedah Basin to investigate the seismic characteristics near an igneous dyke during mining. This longwall mine had a coal seam of Jurassic and Triassic age. The monitored longwall panel was 400\u00a0m wide, 3000\u00a0m long and 280\u00a0m deep. It had a competent conglomerate roof with a thickness of 15\u00a0m to 20\u00a0m which had a controlling effect on longwall periodical weighting. The longwall panel was intersected by a major dyke which has a length of >800\u00a0m (Fig. 2\n). The thickness of this dyke ranged from 0.5\u00a0m to 3\u00a0m. It dipped towards north at an approximate angle of 75\u00b0\u201380\u00b0. As the mining direction of the panel was from north to south, the inbye and outbye indicate the north and south sides of the dyke, respectively. To encourage the overburden to cave and reduce potential seismic hazards, hydraulic fracturing was carried out to weaken the conglomerate roof before the coal seam was mined. However, a number of pressure bumps still occurred near the dyke during roadway development. It was assumed by the mine that the roadway section intersected by the dyke could be a coal burst prone area when the longwall was mining through the dyke. To evaluate and mitigate the coal burst risks, a microseismic monitoring network was installed to monitor the seismic activities in this area.\n\n\n2.2\nMonitoring network\nFour triaxial intrinsically safe geophones were installed for this project. The geophone model is GS-20DX, manufactured by Geospace Technologies. Its corner frequency is 10\u00a0Hz and sensitivity is 27.6\u00a0V\/m\/s. The geophones were placed symmetrically near the dyke along the longwall maingate roadway. On each side of the dyke, one vertical geophone was installed in the roof and one horizontal geophone in the coal seam. The northern components of the triaxial geophones were directed to the north for correct seismic ray path orientation. All geophones were cemented in the boreholes to be well-coupled with the rock mass. The geophone cables were deployed from the ground surface down to the roadway through a borehole. A 12-channel seismic data logger manufactured by ES&S in Australia was installed on the ground surface. This configuration effectively avoided the electronic noise introduced by the high-voltage power line installed along the roadway. It allowed the data acquisition system to be easily accessed for maintenance. The seismic data was continuously recorded using a 1000\u00a0Hz sampling rate. The seismic data recorded from 26 November 2017 to 23 March 2018 was analyzed in this research. During this four-month monitoring period, the longwall retreated approximately 650\u00a0m and mined through the dyke.\nIn addition, one set of stressmeters was deployed in the coal seam at each side of the dyke to monitor the stress changes. Each stressmeter set included a uniaxial and a biaxial stressmeter. The uniaxial stressmeters were installed with an inclined angle of 30\u00b0 upwards. The biaxial stressmeters were installed horizontally 4\u00a0m into the ribs. The uniaxial and biaxial stressmeters were installed approximately 10\u00a0m away from the dyke. The detailed layout of the geophones and stressmeters is shown in Fig. 3\n.\n\n\n\n3\nSeismic data processing methods\n\n3.1\nClustered events classification\nIn this project, two clusters of seismic events were observed. The first cluster of events was around the longwall face and they were mainly associated with the longwall caving induced by the excavation. The second group of events was located within the area of interest as indicated in Fig. 2. To accurately assess the seismic activity near the dyke, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model was developed to discriminate seismic events clustered around the dyke and the longwall face (Duan et al., 2021b). The complete dataset was processed using the DCNN model. The discriminated events were reviewed manually to ensure the seismic events were accurately classified based on their locations.\n\n\n3.2\nEvent location\nBecause the geophones were installed in different geological units with a dyke in the middle of the microseismic monitoring network, the accuracy of event locations can be problematic if a homogeneous velocity model is used for source location. To accurately locate the seismic events around the dyke, geological data (Table 1\n) was collected from the mine to develop a 3D velocity model (Fig. 4\n). The velocity model incorporated the local strata and the dyke. A novel shortest path method based on a boundary discretization scheme (SPM-BDS) (Duan et al., 2021a) was applied for source location. The method proposed by Tarantola and Valette (1982) was adopted to evaluate the location uncertainties. The time measurement errors were used for the evaluation and the median location errors were found to be <10\u00a0m.\n\n\n3.3\nSource mechanism\nThe ratio of energy radiated in P and S waves (Es\/Ep) of a seismic event is an important indicator of its focal mechanism (Cai et al., 1998). To investigate the rock mass fracturing mechanisms near the dyke, Es\/Ep ratios of the dyke-roadway seismic events were analyzed. The seismic energy of P and S waves \n\n\nE\np\n\n\u2032\n\n and \n\n\nE\ns\n\n\u2032\n\n received by each geophone can be expressed as (Landau and Lifshitz, 1986):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nE\np\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u222b\n0\n\nt\np\n\n\n\nx\n2\n\n\nt\n\ndt\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nE\ns\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u222b\n0\n\nt\ns\n\n\n\nx\n2\n\n\nt\n\ndt\n\n\nwhere x is the recorded amplitude of a seismic wave, t\n\nP\n and t\n\ns\n are the time windows for P and S waves. Hence, the seismic energy of P and S waves released at the source point E\n\np\n and E\n\ns\n is computed using the following equations (Kanamori and Anderson, 1975):\n\n(3)\n\n\nE\np\n\n=\n4\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\nV\nP\n\n\n\u03b3\nP\n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n\nE\np\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nE\ns\n\n=\n4\n\u03c0\u03c1\n\nV\nS\n\n\n\u03b3\nS\n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n\nE\ns\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the rock density that the seismic wave travels through, V\n\nP\n and V\n\nS\n are respectively the velocities of P and S waves, R is the travel distance of a seismic wave, \u03b3\n\nP\n and \u03b3\n\nS\n are empirical correction constants which are \n\n2\n5\n\n and \n\n4\n15\n\n for P and S waves, respectively.\nThe spatial variations in velocities of seismic waves are considered for computing the E\n\np\n and E\n\ns\n. The shortest travel paths of P and S waves from the source to geophones are attained with the SPM-BDS. The obtained shortest travel paths are consisted of line segments. The two endpoints on each segment can be viewed as a receiver and a source. The geophone and the other endpoint are respectively the final receiver and source on the last segment. Following Eqs. (1) and (2), seismic energy released at the final receiver is obtained. The distance of the last segment, velocity of seismic wave and mechanical properties of the associated geological unit are incorporated in Eqs. (3) and (4) to compute the seismic energy released at the final source. Then the last source is considered as the receiver on the previous segment along the travel path. The other endpoint on this segment is treated as the source. By iterating this process, the seismic energy of P and S waves released at the actual source point can be obtained to compute the Es\/Ep ratio of the seismic event. The velocities of P and S waves and parameters of geological units used for the energy computation are listed in Table 1.\n\n\n3.4\nFrequency-magnitude distribution\nThe frequency-magnitude distribution of seismicity generally follows a power-law relationship (Gutenberg and Richter, 1956), which is described as:\n\n(5)\n\n\nlog\n10\n\nN\n=\na\n\u2212\nb\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\n\n\nM\nL\n\n\u2265\n\nM\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere N is the number of seismic events of local magnitude M\n\nL\n equal to or greater than the magnitude of completeness M\n\nc\n (i.e., minimum magnitude). The parameter a is a measure of the level of seismicity, whereas the parameter b, which is typically close to 1, indicates the relative number of low-energy and high-energy seismic events in a specified interval of time. The local magnitude scale (Richter, 1935), M\n\nL\n, can be obtained with:\n\n(6)\n\n\nM\nL\n\n=\nlog\n\nA\n\n\u2212\nlog\n\n\nA\n0\n\n\n+\nS\n\n\nwhere A is the maximum amplitude of the body wave on the horizontal components of the geophone, log(A\n0) and S are empirical distance and station correction terms. The b-value has been widely analyzed for hazard assessment in mine seismology (Mondal and Roy, 2019). Statistical observations of the b-value in laboratory experiments and earthquake monitoring have suggested that it can be used as an indicator of stress re-distribution and is closely related to the released seismic energy (Lei et al., 2004; Scholz, 2015; Schorlemmer et al., 2005).\nIn this research, the frequency-magnitude distribution of seismic events is characterized by the b-value using the maximum likelihood method (Godano et al., 2014):\n\n(7)\n\nb\n=\n\n\nlog\ne\n\n\n\nM\n\u00af\n\n\u2212\n\nM\nc\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nM\n\u00af\n\n is the mean magnitude. The associated uncertainty is evaluated following Shi and Bolt (1982):\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nb\n\u0302\n\n\n=\n2.30\n\nb\n2\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nM\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nwhere,\n\n(9)\n\n\n\u03c3\n2\n\n\n\nM\n\u00af\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\ni\n\n\u2212\n\nM\n\u00af\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nn\n\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nMicroseismic characterization of the dyke\n\n4.1\nEvolution of mining-induced seismicity\nIn total, 20,526 seismic events occurred near the dyke in the four months of monitoring. The daily seismicity is shown in Fig. 5\n. Four stages of variations of seismicity and mining progress are identified (Fig. 6\n). The first stage is from 26 November 2017 to 31 January 2018. In this period rock fractures had already initiated around the dyke when the longwall face was 400\u00a0m away from the dyke. During this stage, the seismicity was low until the longwall face was 200\u00a0m from the dyke. Seismicity continued to increase and reached the first peak when the longwall was 100\u00a0m ahead of the dyke on 25 January. After the peak, it gradually dropped and became much less intensive from 28 to 31 January even though the longwall-miner was still mining. The second stage is from 1 to 10 February. The longwall-miner mined the last 50\u00a0m of the inbye part of the dyke. Seismicity erupted to the second peak at the beginning of this stage and remained intensive during the entire period. The third stage is from 11 to 28 February. In this stage, the longwall was mined to the outbye side of the dyke. Seismicity was active before 14 February when the longwall production stopped for maintenance. Mining resumed on 26 February and the daily seismicity reached another peak of nearly 1400 events before the longwall mined past the dyke for 50\u00a0m. The fourth stage is from 1 to 23 March. The seismicity drastically declined after the peak and gradually decreased towards the end of this period, except for one minor sudden seismicity increase on 16 March.\n\n\n4.2\nPropagations of rock fractures\nThis section presents the variations of spatial distributions of seismic events during the four stages defined in Section 4.1. In total, 4047 seismic events were located. The detailed three-dimensional evolutions of the rock fractures around the dyke are shown in Fig. 7\n.\nStage I shows that rock fractures initiated between Headings B and C at the inbye dyke when the longwall was distant from the dyke. The fractures were mainly clustered in the immediate roof and the conglomerate. There was a weak connection in the siltstone layer between the two clusters. Unlike brittle geological structures such as faults, the dyke was stiff and fractures were not located along the dipping angle of the dyke.\nDuring Stage II, the longwall mined to the dyke and the fractures in the immediate roof and conglomerate significantly intensified. Secondary support was completed before the longwall mined to the dyke to stabilize the roadways. More fractures were concentrated in the pillars at the inbye dyke. Meanwhile, the fractures started to propagate to the outbye side. In cross-section, the events were mainly in the immediate roof and coal seam.\nAt the beginning of the third stage, the longwall was mined past the dyke for approximately 20\u00a0m and stopped for 12\u00a0days. After mining resumed, a sudden increase in seismicity was observed. Most of these fractures were in the coal seam and siltstone layers at the outbye side of the dyke. However, no clustered fractures in the conglomerate were identified, indicating an abrupt stress change in the outbye ribs and immediate roof as the longwall mined to the outbye dyke. In the meantime, the rock fractures in the inbye siltstone and conglomerate were connected.\nDuring the last stage, compared with the fracture density at the inbye side while the longwall was mined towards the dyke, it is evident that there was a decrease in seismic events when the mining retreated further away from the dyke. The fractures propagated lower into the coal seam at both inbye and outbye sides. Meanwhile, seismic events clustered in the roof along the outbye roadway (Heading B). At the inbye side of the dyke, a considerate number of seismic events still occurred, indicating continuing rock failures at the inbye side of the dyke even though the longwall had mined past the dyke.\n\n\n4.3\nDistribution of Es\/Ep ratios\nThe distribution of Es\/Ep ratios of all located events is presented in Fig. 8\n. The seismic events with Es\/Ep ratios below 1 and above 10 account for approximately 5% and 10% of the complete dataset, respectively. Because of the distribution, these two types of seismic events were defined as pure tensile and shear events. The distribution also shows the fractures near the dyke were predominantly controlled by shear slips rather than volumetric stress change. As the Es\/Ep ratio increases, the seismic events are more related to pure shear failures and exhibit larger magnitude, which is consistent with the characteristics of the seismic events close to faults (Kwiatek and Ben-Zion, 2013).\nThe 3D distributions of seismic events with different failure mechanisms are shown in Fig. 9\n. To better compare the distribution patterns of these events, the 1D probability density and 2D probability density contours of these event distributions were also estimated using a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) (Rosenblatt, 1956). KDE is a non-parametric method to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of independent samples. The kernel density estimator is expressed as:\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c1\n\nx\n\n=\n\n1\nnh\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\nK\n\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\nx\ni\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\nwhere K is the non-negative kernel function and h is the smoothing bandwidth of the kernel function. The KDE can be performed in any number of dimensions. In this analysis, the Gaussian kernel was applied to estimate the PDF. The bandwidth was selected by Scott's Rule as a \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 (Bashtannyk and Hyndman, 2001).\nAs shown in Fig. 9a, the tensile events appeared to be randomly distributed around the dyke. The majority of the pure shear events with Es\/Ep ratios of >10 were located at the inbye side of the dyke. In cross-section, looking towards the east (Fig. 9b), they were clustered along the dipping angle of the dyke from the conglomerate to the coal seam in cross-section. A few pure shear events were located at the outbye side of the dyke and concentrated in the coal seam. The seismic events with different failure mechanisms show relatively consistent distributions, looking towards the north. They mainly occurred in the pillars and above the roadway of Heading B (Fig. 9c). The distributions suggest that not many fault-slip events were located along the stiff dyke. Fractures were induced in the rock mass of its proximity. The inbye side of the dyke was subjected to more stress concentration and release. Cracks initiated and propagated in all inbye layers, which resulted in progressively more crack closures and shear failures.\n\n\n4.4\nVariations of b-values\nThe frequency-magnitude distribution of seismic events located around the dyke is depicted in Fig. 10\n. The distribution follows a log-linear relationship. The b-value is 1.44 and the magnitude of completeness M\n\nc\n of this dataset is \u22122.5.\nThe temporal variations of the b-value at the dyke were further explored to investigate the correlation with the cumulative seismic energy. A time window of 500 seismic events and a rolling window of 200 events were applied to estimate the variations of b-value. As there were 4047 seismic events located around the dyke, a total number of 18 b-values were estimated for all rolling time windows. To avoid potential computational artifacts, a magnitude unit of 0.5 was applied in the b-value estimation (Nava et al., 2017). The variations of the b-value were correlated with the cumulative seismic energy and number of seismic events (Fig. 11\n).\nIn Stage I, weak fractures initiated at the dyke. The condition for computing the first b-value (recording 500 seismic events) was attained by the end of this stage. In Stage II, the accumulation of released seismic energy started to accelerate and more b-values were obtained because of the more frequent occurrence of seismic events. The b-value and cumulative seismic energy appeared to have an inverse relationship, indicating an increase in the magnitudes of seismic events. When the longwall was being mined in the proximity of the dyke, the b-value was more frequently acquired. It started to increase as the seismic energy accumulation slowed down. It suggested that even though more fractures occurred near the dyke, the released energy of these events was relatively weak as they propagated to the outbye side (Fig. 7). The b-value and seismic energy showed the same patterns in Stage III. There was a slow decrease of b-value from the end of this stage, through to early Stage IV. The b-value became stable after a sudden minor increase of cumulative seismic energy after the longwall mined to approximately 80\u00a0m beyond the dyke.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussions and conclusions\nIn this project, the longwall location controlled the seismicity recorded by the four geophones. However, even though the longwall was distant from the dyke, mining could still induce seismic events near the dyke. As shown in Fig. 5, the seismicity became active when the longwall was mined to 200\u00a0m ahead of the dyke. The rock fractures were mainly at the inbye side of the dyke (Fig. 7a). The fractures continued to develop and led to more significant shear failures as the longwall face approached the dyke. As a result, the cumulation of seismic energy accelerated and the b-value decreased before the longwall face mined through the dyke. After the longwall mined past the dyke, rock fractures propagated to the outbye side of the dyke. It appeared that the outbye coal seam and immediate roof were prone to weak fractures so that the stress was more frequently released. As a result, only a few pure shear failures occurred at the outbye side of the dyke.\nAs discussed above, it is evident that the seismic characteristics at the inbye and outbye sides of the dyke behaved differently. To further demonstrate their different behaviors, the seismic events were categorized as two groups: the inbye and outbye events. The seismic energy of each group of events was correlated with the changes of vertical stresses in the inbye and outbye roofs (Fig. 12\n). The figure demonstrated that as the longwall face moved closer to the dyke, the stress near the dyke was larger and more intensive seismicity was recorded. The changes in seismicity follow a non-linear relationship with the distance of the longwall face to the dyke. The seismic energy responded more sensitively than the stress when the longwall mined the inbye side of the dyke. On the other hand, the outbye vertical stress correlated better with the released seismic energy. Especially during the two periods A and B as marked in Fig. 12, two sudden seismic energy releases were observed, which correspond with the abnormal changes of the vertical stress, respectively.\nIn conclusion, multiple temporal-spatial seismic parameters including seismicity, event locations, Es\/Ep ratio, b-value distribution and correlation with the stress conditions were characterized to analyze the rock mass response to longwall mining near a major dyke at an underground coal mine. The main results are summarized below:\n\n1.\nA group of mining-induced seismic events near the dyke was registered. Four stages were defined based on the temporal variations of seismicity. The distance between the longwall face and the dyke controlled the frequency of seismic events. The seismicity was more intensive when the longwall was being mined towards the dyke than the seismicity when the longwall was being mined away from the dyke.\n\n\n2.\nThe seismic events were concentrated at the hanging wall of the dyke. They were mainly distributed in the pillar ribs, immediate roof and conglomerate, which correlated well with the orientation of the dyke. The rock fractures propagated to the outbye side when the longwall was mined through the dyke at the end of Stage II. Most of the outbye fractures were in the pillar ribs and immediate roof.\n\n\n3.\nThe majority of the seismic events were dictated by shear fractures. As the Es\/Ep ratio increased, the event magnitude increased. The seismic events with higher Es\/Ep ratios were located at the inbye side of the dyke.\n\n\n4.\nThe temporal variations of the b-value near the dyke were evaluated. A reduction of b-value was observed before the longwall mined through the dyke and it indicated higher magnitude seismic events dominated by shear failures occurred at the inbye side of the dyke, suggesting more sudden seismic energy release and escalating seismic risks in this area. When the longwall was mining through the dyke, even though the seismicity was intensive, the energy was more frequently but gently released so that stress was not significantly accumulated to induce any major failures at the outbye side of the dyke.\n\n\n5.\nThe released seismic energy was well correlated with the stress measurements from the field in both temporal and spatial domains. It depicted the local stress re-distribution status close to the dyke and its changes were more sensitive than the stress changes, indicating the seismic energy may provide earlier warning on the impending rock dynamic hazards.\n\n\n\nThe presence of the dyke intersected by the roadway intensified the mining-induced seismicity. The temporal-spatial variations of seismic characteristics revealed that the rock mass responses at the inbye and outbye sides of the dyke were different. The failure mode of the dyke was associated with its geological features (geometry and stiffness) and the mining direction of the longwall face. The comprehensive analysis could provide reliable indicators to the mine for coal burst risk forecast and management near such intrusive geological discontinuities.\n\n","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nA\n\nbentonite\n\n\n\nspecific surface area of bentonite\n\n\nA\n\nm\n\n\n\nspecific surface area of montmorillonite\n\n\nA\n\nnm\n\n\n\nspecific surface area of mineral in bentonite excluding montmorillonite\n\n\nC\n\nm\n\n\n\nmontmorillonite content in bentonite\n\n\nD\n\n\nwater diffusivity\n\n\nd\n\n001\n\n\n\nbasal spacing\n\n\nd\n\n001,s\n and d\n\n001,d\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n of specimen in saturated and dried state, respectively\n\n\ne\n\n\nvoid ratio\n\n\nk\n\n\nhydraulic conductivity\n\n\nn\n\ntotal\n\n\n\ntotal porosity\n\n\nn\n\nmicro\n, n\n\nmacro\n and n\n\ntotal\n\n\n\nmicroporosity, macroporosity and total porosity, respectively\n\n\nn\n\nmicro,s\n, n\n\nmacro,s\n and n\n\ntotal,s\n\n\n\nmicroporosity, macroporosity and total porosity in saturated specimen, respectively\n\n\nn\n\nmonmicro\n\n\n\nmontmorillonite microporosity\n\n\nn\n\nnonmicro\n\n\n\nnon-montmorillonite microporosity\n\n\nS\n\nmont\n\n\n\nsingle face surface area of unit montmorillonite layer\n\n\nS\n\nr\n\n\n\ndegree of saturation\n\n\nV\n\n\ntotal volume\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n\n\n\nmontmorillonite volume\n\n\nV\n\nmon,d\n and V\n\nmon,d\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n in dried and saturated states, respectively\n\n\nV\n\nil\n\n\n\ninter-layer pore volume\n\n\nw\n\n\ngravimetric water content\n\n\nw\n\nr\n\n\n\nresidual gravimetric water content\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\nX-ray diffraction angle\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n\ntotal suction\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nvolumetric water content\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n0\n and \u03b8\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8 in initial state and saturated state, respectively\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nr\n\n\n\nresidual volumetric water content\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro\n\n\n\nmacrovolumetric water content\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro,s\n\n\n\nmacrovolumetric water content in saturated state\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro,r\n\n\n\nresidual macrovolumetric water content\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmicro\n\n\n\nmicrovolumetric water content\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmicro,s\n\n\n\nmicrovolumetric water content in saturated state\n\n\n\u0398\n\n\nrelative permeability\n\n\n\u0398\n\nmacro\n\n\n\nnew relative permeability by macro pore\n\n\n\u03c4\n\ntotal,s\n and \u03c4\n\nmacro,s\n\n\n\ntortuosity of saturated total pore and macropore, respectively\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\na parameter\u00a0=\u00a0z\/\u221at\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIt is an urgent issue to handle high level radioactive waste (HLW) from nuclear power industry. Many countries planned to seal HLW deeply underground, which is designated as deep geological disposal method. In a Japanese deep geological disposal project, a multi-barrier system, including vitrified waste, stainless over pack container, buffer material and host rock, would be constructed ~300\u00a0m underground to prevent the leakage of HLW. Bentonites and their based mixtures were selected as candidate buffer materials due to their low hydraulic conductivities (Komine and Ogata, 2004; Komine, 2008).\nIt is very hard to obtain hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated bentonite with steady state method, since suction control is technically difficult. Instantaneous profiling method (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Lu and Likos, 2004) was carried out by some investigators to obtain hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated bentonite. This method can be divided into two ways: 1) monitor instantaneous relative humidity. Cui et al. (2008) and Ye et al. (2009) installed several relative humidity sensors in a column permeability-meter to measure hydraulic conductivities of bentonites under wetting; 2) observe instant water content. Water diffusivities of bentonites were studied by Takeuchi et al. (1995) and Wang et al. (2020) by measuring water contents of evenly cut slices from column specimens. Moreover, hydraulic conductivity can be calculated by water diffusivity and soil water retention curve (SWRC). In this study, a new multi-ring was designed to obtain hydraulic conductivities of unsaturated bentonites by instantaneous profiling method following Takeuchi et al. (1995).\nExperimental observations already indicated that hydraulic conductivities of soils being affected greatly by their pores systems (Dixon et al., 1999; Gao et al., 2021). Kozeny-Carmen (KC) equation, which was proposed by Kozeny (1927) and later progressed by Carman (1937), Carman (1938) and Carman (1939), is a well-known relation between hydraulic conductivities and pores distributions. Some textbooks (e.g., Demenico and Schwartz, 1997; Corey, 2003) reported that the KC equation applies to sands instead of clays. However, this view was just supported by partial demonstration (Chapuis and Aubertin, 2003). Later studies reported that, KC equation performed well for non-swelling soils (Fig. 1\n\n(a) from Chapuis and Aubertin, 2003) and that equation cannot predict bentonites hydraulic conductivities correctly (Fig. 1\n(b) from Chen et al., 2021). Efforts were made by scholars (e.g., Chen et al., 2021) to modifying KC equation for predicting hydraulic conductivities of bentonites by the assumption that: inter-layer pores (Fig. 2\n) have limited influence on the flow of waters in compacted bentonites (Ichikawa et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2005; Pusch and Yong, 2006). Inter-layer pores can be quantitatively evaluated by basal spacing (Fig. 2) from X-ray diffraction testing results (Likos and Lu, 2006; Holmboe et al., 2012; Sedighi and Thomas, 2014). The new multi-ring can also be applied to XRD tests, furthermore providing experimental data to modify KC equation.\nIn this study, a new multi-ring was designed to obtain hydraulic conductivities and basal spacings of unsaturated bentonites synchronously. A dual pores system, which can be quantified by basal spacing, was proposed to modify KC equation for predicting saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of bentonites well.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and testing methodology\n\n2.1\nMaterial\nThis study used three bentonites: 1) MX-80, sodium type bentonite from Wyoming, USA; 2) Kunigel-V1, sodium type bentonite from Yamagata, Japan; and 3) Kunibon, calcium type bentonite from Miyagi, Japan. Physical properties of these bentonites and their values are presented in Table 1\n. Soil particle density of each bentonite was obtained by JGS 0111-2009. The percentages of fines (grain size <0.075\u00a0mm) in bentonites were determined by passing air-dried bentonites through 0.075\u00a0mm sieve. Montmorillonite contents were measured using methylene blue adsorption method (JIS, 2019). CECs (total cation exchangeable capacity) and EXCs (amount of extractable cations) were tested following JGS 0261\u20132009 (JGS, 2009a; JGS, 2009b).\n\n\n2.2\nTesting methodology for confined wetting with multi-ring and XRD test\nThe saturation tests were carried out with a wetting apparatus (Fig. 3\n\n(a) by applying a newly designed multi-ring (Fig. 3\n(b),\nFig. 3\n(d)). The multi-ring comprises five mold rings (~2\u00a0mm thickness) and four two-piece rings (~0.25\u00a0mm thickness) installed between mold rings (Fig. 3\n(c),\nFig. 3\n(d)). Herein, each mold ring was numbered as No. 1-No. 5 by the vertical direction (Fig. 3\n(b)). To achieve height of ~11\u00a0mm and diameter of 28\u00a0mm specimen, air dried bentonite powders were put into multi-ring and compressed in a static load device. Then, multi-ring mold together with specimen (Fig. 2(d)) were installed in the wetting apparatus. The parts of the multi-ring in contact with the air were wrapped by plastic film to prevent the evaporation of water in specimen during saturation. Finally, distilled water was supplied by the water inlet from the bottom of specimen.\nIn each dry density condition, seven specimens were prepared for the wetting duration of 2\u2013240\u00a0h. Specimen details are presented in Table 2\n. After different wetting durations, water supply was terminated. Multi-ring and specimen were taken out and their vertical deformation was constrained by a clip immediately (Fig. 3\n(e)). Later, two-piece rings were removed one by one and specimen was carefully sliced from the tiny gap between mold rings into five slices using a thin saw (~0.20\u00a0mm thickness, Fig. 3\n(e)). Afterwards, slices were sealed immediately using a Para film (Fig. 3\n(e)). Then, slices with Para film were placed under constrained condition at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) for at least 48\u00a0h to achieve uniform water distributions. Subsequently, these slices were sent to XRD tests (Fig. 3\n(f)). A diffractometer, RINT-UltimaIII (Rigaku Corp., Japan), with Cu K\u03b1 source was employed. The X-ray scan range was 2.7\u00b0-10\u00b0 with a scan speed of 20\u00b0\/min under Parallel-Beam geometry. A relative fast scanning speed was chosen for minimizing the possible specimen rebound and water evaporation during XRD scanning. After XRD tests, water content of each slice was measured.\n\n\n2.3\nTesting methodology for wetting with 5-mm height ring and SWRC test\nNormally, vapor equilibrium method (e.g., Sun et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2010) was adopted to prepare specimen for soil water retention curve (SWRC). In that method, specimens were putted in salt solution-controlled relative humidity to achieve different water contents. However, the former multi-ring confined wetting tests were infiltered by distilled water. In order to maintain the consistency of testing conditions, the specimens for the suction measurement in this study were wetted by distilled water as well. In this section, a 5-mm height ring (Fig. 4\n\n) was used instead of the above-mentioned multi-ring. Although there were differences in the thickness of specimens, Iyer et al. (2013) reported that the specimen thickness has limited effect on SWRC.\nFirstly, specimens were prepared as introduced before. Then, 5-mm height ring and specimen were sandwiched by two stainless plates and their vertical deformations were restricted by bolts. Hereafter, specimens were wetted by immersing them into distilled water (Fig. 4). In each dry density, eight specimens were prepared for wetting duration of 0.5\u201396\u00a0h. Specimen details by using 5-mm height ring are listed in Table 2. After different wetting durations, specimens were taken out and sealed by Parafilm immediately. For achieving as uniformly as water distribution, specimens were placed in confined condition for at least 10\u00a0days at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C). After that, specimens were pushed out from 5-mm height ring carefully and sent to suction measurement with WP4C dew-point potentiometer immediately. Comparing to the previous 2-mm height slice, the 5-mm height specimen was placed for a much longer time to obtain an even water distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to check the loss of water during placement. Herein, specimens (including the 5\u00a0mm ring and Para film) were weighed after sealing and before suction measurement. The mass differences of specimens were all less than 0.01\u00a0g, indicating that almost no reduction of water occurred during placement. After suction measurement, water content of each specimen was measured.\n\n\n\n3\nHydraulic conductivities and XRD results from multi-ring\n\n3.1\nHydraulic conductivity under confined wetting from water diffusivity\n\n3.1.1\nSWRCs of bentonites\n\nFig. 5\n indicates total suction (\u03c8) changing with volumetric water content (\u03b8) of three bentonites used in this study. The relation between the volumetric water content and total suction can be fitted by Van Genuchten (VG) equation (Genuchten, 1980) as:\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b8\n=\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n+\n\n\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n\u03b1\u03c8\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n1\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1 and n are fitting parameters with testing database; \u03b8\n\ns\n is volumetric water content of saturated specimen, %; \u03b8\n\nr\n is residual volumetric water content, %. The fitting lines are also presented as dash lines in Fig. 5. It is apparent from Fig. 5, the results in this study can be fitted by VG equation well. The fitting parameters and their values are presented in Table 3\n.\n\n\n3.1.2\nWater diffusivity during saturation\nGravimetric water contents in slices after water absorption are presented in Fig. 6\n. It is a general truth from Fig. 6, gravimetric water content generally decreases as increasing distance from bottom of specimen (z) and increases with the rising wetting duration (t), when t\u00a0<\u00a0120\u00a0h. After 120\u00a0h, gravimetric water contents stay in relative stable values. Bruce and Klute (1956) and Corey (2003) related water diffusivity (D) with volumetric water content (\u03b8) and hydraulic conductivity (k) as:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\nk\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing the results, the influence of gravity (\u2202k\/\u2202z) on water flow was often ignored. Therefore, Eq. (2) can be expressed as:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKlute and Dirksen (1986) brought a parameter \u03c7 (=z\/\u221at) into Eq. (3), and used Boltzmann transformation changed that partial differential equation to an ordinary equation as:\n\n(4)\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\nd\u03c7\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nd\u03b8\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03b8\n\nd\u03b8\n\n\nwhere \u03b8\n\n0\n signifies the initial volumetric water content, %. In this study, specimens were cut into slices of equal height to obtain water diffusivity. Clothier et al. (1983) and Wang et al. (2020) tried to use mathematical methods to fit the relation between \u03c7 and \u03b8. As Wang et al. (2020) reported, the relation between \u03c7 and \u03b8 can be fitted as:\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\nA\n\u2212\nBln\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere A, B and C are fitting parameters. By bringing Eq. (5) into Eq. (4), an easy equation for the calculation of water diffusivity can be proposed:\n\n(6)\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\nAB\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\nB\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\nln\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\n0\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 7\n presents the relation between \u03b8 and \u03c7 for MX-80, Kunigel-V1 and Kunibon, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 7, experimental database generally follows Eq. (5). Therefore, the determination for water diffusivity in this study can be calculated by using Eq. (6). Normally, the equation for calculating the degree of saturation can be given as:\n\n(7)\n\n\nS\nr\n\n=\n\n\u03b8\n\ne\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere e is the void ratio of specimen; \u03c1\n\nw\n is the density of water, Mg\/m3. Usually, density of water was adopted as 1\u00a0Mg\/m3. Fig. 8\n depicts water diffusivity changing with degree of saturation (S\n\nr\n), which was obtained by applying \u03c1\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0Mg\/m3 to Eq. (7). A ready conclusion can be drawn from Fig. 8 that, for three bentonites in this study, water diffusivity decreases concomitantly with increasing degree of saturation. Same conclusion was addressed by Wang et al. (2020). However, a U shape for water diffusivity and degree of saturation curve was reported by Takeuchi et al. (1995) by using following equation:\n\n(8)\n\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nt\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nt\n1\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u222b\n\nz\ni\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n1\n\n\n\n\n\ndz\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nzi\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n=\n\nt\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nzi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 9\n presents water diffusivity changing with degree of saturation for Kunigel-V1 bentonite from this study and literatures by different calculating equations as introduced above. It is noted here, the degree of saturation in Fig. 9 was achieved by applying \u03c1\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0Mg\/m3 into Eq. (7). As presented in Fig. 9, different calculating equations bring different curve shape. However, the difference from different calculating equations is very small in the same magnitude.\nThe density of water in montmorillonite inter-layer space was reported over 1\u00a0Mg\/m3 (Pusch and Yong, 2006; Jacinto et al., 2012), resulting in the average density of waters in compacted bentonite surpasses 1\u00a0Mg\/m3. When adopting \u03c1\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0Mg\/m3 in Eq. (7), bigger calculating results would be obtained, which can be easily observed from Fig. 8. As revealed in Fig. 8, for all three bentonites in this study, the degrees of saturation exceed 100%. Similar phenomenon was reported by Wang et al. (2020) and Jacinto et al. (2012). The maximum degrees of saturation of MX-80, Kunige-V1 and Kunibon are approxi. 120%, 110% and 120%, respectively. Herein, another equation was proposed to calculate the degree of saturation, as:\n\n(9)\n\n\nS\nr\n\n=\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b8\n\ns\n is volumetric water content of saturated specimen from SWRCs as listed in Table 3, %. The water diffusivity changing with degree of saturation by Eq. (9) is indicated in Fig. 10\n. Comparing with Fig. 8, the maximum degrees of saturations for bentonites in Fig. 10 are greatly reduced. And, maximum degrees of saturations for bentonites decreased to approxi. 100%. Herein, it is worth noting that following degrees of saturation in this study are all calculated by Eq. (9).\n\n\n3.1.3\nHydraulic conductivity of bentonites during saturation\nAdditionally, the relation between water diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity can be given as (Corey, 2003; Lu and Likos, 2004):\n\n(10)\n\nk\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\u03c8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u2202(\u03c8)\/\u2202(\u03b8) can be obtainable from SWRC. By combining Fig. 10, Eq.\n\n(1)\n, Eq.\n\n(10)\n and Table 3, hydraulic conductivities of unsaturated bentonites can be achieved. Fig. 11\n shows hydraulic conductivity changing with volumetric water content of bentonites. It is apparently from Fig. 11 that, hydraulic conductivity exhibits a \u201c\u0548\u201d shape with the change of volumetric water content. A \u201c\u0548\u201d shape was also reported by Takeuchi et al. (1995) for k - \u03b8 curve of Kunigel-V1 bentonite. Additionally, from Cui et al. (2008), Ye et al. (2009) and Wang et al. (2013), a \u201cU\u201d shape for k - \u03c8 relations of bentonites were addressed. These results do not correspond to the observations commonly made on non-expansive unsaturated soils, for which hydraulic conductivity increases in a continuous way upon wetting. This phenomenon may because of the microstructure evolutions of compacted bentonite during saturation. By MIP and SEM tests, Pusch and Yong (2006), Musso et al. (2013) and Romero (2013) indicated that, the microstructure of bentonite is dynamic with water adsorption. With the increase of water content, aggregates are expected to be divisible into particles (e.g., Musso et al., 2013). In relative dry stage, hydraulic conductivity was governed by the suction gradient. As the infiltration of water, suction decreases with increasing water content, leading to an increase in hydraulic conductivity. When approaching saturated state, aggregates were expected to break down into particles (Fig. 2). The hydraulic conductivity would be converted to be controlled by the inter-particle pores. As the saturation proceeds, the particle volume would expand, thereby compressing the inter-particle pores. The permeation channel would become smaller as the inter-particle pore decreases, resulting in a decrease in hydraulic conductivity.\n\n\n\n3.2\nX-Ray diffraction results\n\n3.2.1\nXRD profiles\n\nFig. 12\n shows XRD profiles of slices in vertical direction (Slice No. 1-No. 5 as Fig. 3\n(b)) at some wetting durations. It is noteworthy that the Y axis in Fig. 12 is an arbitrary scale, not a specific scale. It can be easily found from Fig. 12, water content generally decreases when slice changes from No. 1-No. 5, when t\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h. And when t\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0h, water contents are in relative stable values. Besides that, from Fig. 12, one can readily inferred is the peaks exist in XRD profiles. As we can see from Fig. 12, for all three bentonites, when t\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h, the peaks slowly move to the right when slice changes from No. 1-No. 5. When t\u00a0=\u00a0240\u00a0h, peaks seem to occur in similar diffraction angles.\n\nFig. 13\n depicts XRD profiles of some slices changing with wetting duration. Unlike Fig. 12, Y axis in Fig. 13 is a specific scale. As indicated in Fig. 13, water contents of slices generally increase as wetting duration rises. Regarding the peak position, from Fig. 13, peaks happen when 2\u03c6\u00a0=\u00a0approx. 4\u20138\u00b0. A generally trend from Fig. 13 can be concluded that, peak moves from approx. 8\u00b0 to approx. 4\u00b0 as wetting duration rises. Another phenomenon can be found from Fig. 13 that, intensity of XRD profile seems grow as increasing wetting duration, which means that intensity of XRD profile might increase as the increase of water content. Another important ingredient can be observed from Fig. 13 is the state of water molecule arrangement in inter-layer space (L). As Wang et al. (2020) reported, d\n\n001\n\u00a0=\u00a010.1\u00a0\u00c5, 12.5\u00a0\u00c5, 15.5\u00a0\u00c5 and 19.0\u00a0\u00c5 are viewed as the dividing values for L\u00a0=\u00a00w, 1w, 2w and 3w, respectively. Meanwhile, from Wang et al. (2021), the dividing values for 2\u03b8\npeak of different L states are 2\u03b8\npeak\u00a0=\u00a09\u00b0 (0w), 2\u03b8\npeak\u00a0=\u00a07\u00b0 (1w), 2\u03b8\npeak\u00a0=\u00a05.6\u00b0 (2w) and 2\u03b8\npeak\u00a0=\u00a04.7\u00b0 (3w), respectively. As we can see from Fig. 13, L states slowly move to 3w as wetting duration increases. Additionally, even though 2\u03b8\npeak position and water content are both very close, the XRD profiles shape are somewhat different. This may show that the shape of XRD profile might be not a single pattern in a certain L state.\n\n\n3.2.2\nBasal spacing\nWhen bentonite absorbs water, the montmorillonite crystal layers would expand in the c direction (001). This distance, which is generally accepted as basal spacing (d\n\n001\n, Fig. 2), is obtainable using XRD profiles (e.g., Holmboe et al., 2012; Villar et al., 2012) by the peak position when 2\u03c6\u00a0=\u00a0approx. 4\u20138\u00b0 using Bragg's law:\n\n(11)\n\n\nd\n001\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\u03bb\n\n2\nsin\n\n\u03c6\npeak\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bb represents the incident wave (=1.5418\u00a0\u00c5) wavelength and \u03bc stands for the position integer (=1); \u03c6\n\npeak\n is the angle when peak occurs, \u00b0. Fig. 14\n reveals the basal spacing of each slice for bentonites used in study. By connecting average values of five slices with the same saturation periods by dash lines in figure, the overall trend of specimens with the same dry density is indicated. It can be readily inferred from Fig. 14 that, for three bentonites in this study, basal spacings increase dramatically at the beginning of the wetting period. Then, basal spacings enter into stable state. Times for different bentonites to reach stable values are various: approx. 120\u00a0h for MX-80, approx. 120\u00a0h for Kunigel-V1, and approx. 50\u00a0h for Kunibon. Fig. 14 also reveals state of water molecule arrangement in inter-layer space (L) for different bentonites during saturation. Over time, all three bentonites eventually reach 3w state (MX-80: 1w-3w; Kunigel-V1: 1w-3w; Kunibon: 2w-3w).\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nModifying KC equation to predict hydraulic conductivities\n\n4.1\nIntroduction of KC equation\nIt is well known that hydraulic conductivity is affected significantly by pores system (Dixon et al., 1999; Gao et al., 2021). Kozeny-Carmen (KC) equation, which was proposed by Kozeny (1927) basing on Stoke's law and later progressed by Carman (1937, 1938, 1939), related saturated hydraulic conductivity (k\n\nsat\n) with saturated total porosity (n\n\ntotal,s\n). The KC equation can be expressed as followings:\n\n(12)\n\n\nk\nsat\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b3\nw\n\n\n\u03bc\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\ntotal\n,\ns\n\n\n2\n\n\nA\n2\n\n\n\u03c1\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\ntotal\n,\ns\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nn\n\ntotal\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(13)\n\n\n\u03c4\n\ntotal\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212\n0.5\nln\n\n\nn\n\ntotal\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(14)\n\n\n\n\u03bc\nw\n\n=\n\ngv\nw\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1\nd is the dry density of specimen (Mg\/m3); A is the specific surface area of specimen (m2\/g); \u03b3\nw represents the unit weight of water (N\/m3, \u03b3\nw=\ng\u03c1\nw); v\nw signifies the kinematic viscosity of water; C\ns is a dimensionless shape constant recommended as 0.2 for soils (Carman, 1939); \u03c4\n\ntotal,s\n is the tortuosity of saturated total pores; and A is the specific surface area of specimen. From some text books in geotechnical field (e.g., Demenico and Schwartz, 1997; Corey, 2003), the KC equation was considered to be approximately valid for sands and inadequate for clays. The reasons why they do this statement may because of the following two main limitations of KC equation (Carrier, 2003):\n1. This equation based on a solid-fluid system, which needs the surface of porous material is relatively compacted and flat;\n2. This equation assumed that there is no electrical-chemical reaction between fluid and porous material.\nRegarding above two aspects, Carman (1939) and Zhai et al. (2022) ascribed that a thin water layer or \u201cwater film\u201d would attach on the surface of soil minerals (Chapuis and Aubertin, 2003; Pusch and Yong, 2006) due to the negative charged soil minerals. Fig. 15\n shows mineral structures, water flow paths of kaolinite and illite. The thin water film would provide a soil mineral-fluid interface for water to flow between unit kaolinite and illite mineral layers (Zhai et al., 2022). In the case of kaolinite, although there would be some potassium cations existing in the inter-layer space (Mitchell and Kenichi, 2005), it is assumed that these potassium cations do not affect the flow of water due to the small hydration potential energy. Meanwhile, that thin water film may weaken the electrical-chemical reactions between fluid and soil mineral to some extent. Efforts were made by scholars to verifying the validity the KC equation to some non-expansive soils. Fig. 1\n(a) presents the comparison between experimental saturated hydraulic conductivities of Kaolinite, Illite and Boston blue clay (Olsen, 1960), Champlain clays (Tavenas et al., 1983), and Kaolinite (Al-Tabbaa and Wood, 1987) and their prediction by KC from Chapuis and Aubertin (2003). It can be easily found from Fig. 1\n(a), KC equation can predict saturated hydraulic conductivities of non-expansive soils well. However, KC equation was reported cannot predict saturated hydraulic conductivities of bentonites well (Chen et al., 2021). Fig. 1\n(b) presents saturated hydraulic conductivities of some bentonites and their predictions by KC equation from Chen et al. (2021). It is apparently from Fig. 1\n(b) that there are errors between predictive values calculated using KC equation and experimental data of different bentonites: Kunigel-V1 (Cui et al., 2008), GMZ (Ye et al., 2014) and FEBEX (Lloret and Villar, 2007).\n\n\n4.2\nModifying KC Equation by Waters Flow Mechanism in Pores of Bentonite\n\nFig. 2 indicates the traditional structure of compacted bentonite. Bentonite is a mixture of non-swelling and swelling minerals. Regarding the swelling mineral in bentonite, montmorillonite is often viewed as the only mineral contribute to the swelling (e.g., Komine and Ogata, 1996; Komine and Ogata, 2004). Montmorillonite has a unique 2:1 mineral structure consists of two structural units: silica tetrahedron and alumina octahedron (e.g. Jacinto et al., 2012). Unit layers, which are negative charged (Komine, 2008), are often stacked one above another, composing particles. Unit layer numbers needed to form a particle is changeable and reported decreasing with rising degree of saturation (Chen et al., 2021). Besides that, several particles would form an aggregate. The microstructures of compacted bentonite are dynamic during saturation (Suzuki et al., 2005). Big aggregates\/particles are expected being divided into small aggregates\/particles with the progress of hydration (Romero, 2013; Chen et al., 2021). In the case of pores in bentonite, different categories were proposed (e.g., Gens and Alonso, 1992; Pusch and Yong, 2006). Among those classifications, a generally accepted one is (Fig. 2, referred from Pusch and Yong, 2006) that: 1) micro-level pores, pores between montmorillonite layers (inter-layer pores), 2) meso-level pores, pores between particles (inter-particle pores), and 3) macro-level pores, pores between aggregates (inter-aggregate pores).\nAdditionally, waters in compacted bentonite are categorized by their positions, as: a) water in inter-layer pore (inter-layer water); b) water in inter-aggregate pore (inter-aggregate water); and c) water in intra-aggregate pore (intra-aggregate water). Firstly, regarding the inter-layer water. Montmorillonite has much greater hydration potential than kaolinite and illite (Pusch and Yong, 2006). When montmorillonite layers meet water, the greater hydration force would attract the cations and water molecules into inter-layer pores (Fig. 2, Olphen, 1977). And, those cations and water molecules would be orderly arranged on the surface of negative charged montmorillonite layers, enlarging the inter-layer space (Yong, 1999b). Unlike the waters between kaolinite and illite unit layers, the inter-layer water of montmorillonite is viewed as immobile due to the much bigger attractive force between water molecule and unit layers from significantly greater hydration potential (Bradbury and Baeyens, 2003). Meanwhile, inter-layer pores were reported having negligible contribution to the flow of water in compacted bentonite by many scholars (Ichikawa et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2005; Pusch and Yong, 2006). Secondly, for the inter-particle water. Inter-particle water can be divided into free water and diffuse double layer (DDL) water (Tachi and Yotsuji, 2014; Chen et al., 2021). Free water is considered to be moveable (Appelo and Wersin, 2007). DDL water is resulted from the soil particle-water \u201cosmotic\u201d or \u201cmatric\u201d interactions (Yong, 1999a). After soil particle encounters water, the osmotic potential generated by the movement of ions in the fluid would bring a thin \u201cwater film\u201d on the surface of montmorillonite particles (Fig. 2). This \u201cwater film\u201d can be regarded as the fixed layer of DDL to a certain degree, and designated as DDL water. DDL water has less mobility than free water and better mobility than inter-layer water (Chen et al., 2021). The thin \u201cwater film\u201d or DDL water on the montmorillonite particle surface may provide a solid-fluid interface for free water to move (Fig. 2). Thirdly, inter-aggregate water is viewed as free water because of the permeable tunnel between aggregates is considerable.\nIn this study, another pores classification is proposed by Likos and Lu (2006) and Sedighi and Thomas (2014), as: 1) micro pore is defined as the inter-layer pore, and 2) macro pore is the pore excluding inter-layer pore (including inter-aggregate pore and intra-aggregate pore). With the discussions above, the water flowing mechanism by pores can be summarized as: macro pore is the flow path for moveable water (Fig. 2).\nAdditionally, basing on the aforementioned discussions, this study changed n\n\ntotal,s\n in traditional KC equation by n\n\nmacro,s\n (saturated macroporosity), and \u03c4\n\ntotal,s\n was replaced by \u03c4\n\nmacro,s\n (tortuosity of saturated macro pore) as modified KC equation:\n\n(15)\n\n\nk\nsat\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b3\nw\n\n\n\u03bc\nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n\n2\n\n\nA\nbentonite\n2\n\n\n\u03c1\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nn\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(16)\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212\n0.5\nln\n\n\nn\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere A\n\nbentonite\n is the specific surface area of bentonite (m2\/g). Herein, specific surface areas of bentonites were calculated following Komine and Ogata (1996) and Komine and Ogata (2004), as:\n\n(17)\n\n\nA\nbentonite\n\n=\n\nC\nm\n\n\nA\nm\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nC\nm\n\n\n\n\nA\nnm\n\n\n\nwhere C\n\nm\n stands for the montmorillonite contents of bentonite, A\n\nm\n denotes the specific surface area of montmorillonite, and A\n\nnm\n expresses the specific surface area of excluding montmorillonite. A\n\nm\n\u00a0=\u00a0810\u00a0m2\/g and A\n\nnm\n\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0m2\/g were applied by Komine and Ogata (1996) and Komine and Ogata (2004).\nBesides that, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (k\n\nunsat) can be predicted by saturated hydraulic conductivity (k\n\nsat) and relative permeability (\u0398) by Brooks and Corey (1964):\n\n(18)\n\n\nk\nunsat\n\n=\n\nk\nsat\n\n\u0398\n\n\n\n\n\n(19)\n\n\u0398\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nr\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b7 stands for the fitting parameter with testing data. Herein, following above flow mechanisms in compacted bentonite, \u0398 is changed to \u0398\n\nmacro\n as:\n\n(20)\n\n\n\u0398\nmacro\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro\n,\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nmacro\n,\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nmacro\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b8\n\nmacro\n expresses the macrovolumetric water content (volumetric water content in macropore, %); \u03b8\n\nmacro,r\n stands for the macroresidual volumetric water content (%); \u03b8\n\nmacro,s\n expresses the macrovolumetric water content in saturated state (%). \u03b7 was adopted as 3 for the average of Brooks and Corey (1964), Lu and Likos (2004) and Chen et al. (2021).\n\n\n4.3\nDetermination for basal spacing during saturation\nFor calculating the basal spacing of saturated specimen (d\n\n001,s\n), this study assumes that, the change of pore volume during saturation in confined condition is only affected by the volume change of micro pore (inter-layer pore, Fig. 16\n). Changing another word, this study supposed that the inter-layer swellings dominate swellings of bentonite. Therefore, a relation between montmorillonite volume in saturated condition (V\n\nmon,s\n) and montmorillonite volume in dried condition (V\n\nmon,d\n) can be expressed as:\n\n(21)\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n,\ns\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n,\nd\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nm\n\u00d7\n\nS\nmont\n\n\u00d7\n\nd\n\n001\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\nm\n\u00d7\n\nS\nmont\n\n\u00d7\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\ns\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere S\n\nmont\n is the single face surface area of unit montmorillonite layer (46.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00c52, from Holmboe et al., 2012); d\n\n001, d\n is the basal spacing of dried bentonite (9.8\u00a0\u00c5, from Wang et al., 2021); m is the number of unit montmorillonite layer in bentonite. The relation between V\n\nmon,s\n and V\n\nmon,d\n can also be formed as:\n\n(22)\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n,\ns\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n,\nd\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nV\n\u2212\n\nV\n\nnon\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nmon\n,\nd\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nm\ns\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nd\n\n\u2212\n\nm\ns\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nC\nm\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\n\nnon\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nm\ns\n\n\nC\nm\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nmon\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nC\nm\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\n\nnon\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nm\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nmon\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere V\n\nnon,m\n is the non-montmorillonite volume in compacted bentonite; V is the total volume of compacted bentonite; m\n\ns\n is the total dry mass of bentonite; \u03c1\n\nmon\n is the dry density of montmorillonite (2.80\u00a0Mg\/m3, from Holmboe et al., 2012). \u03c1\n\nnon,m\n is the dry density of non-montmorillonite (2.77\u00a0Mg\/m3, from Holmboe et al., 2012). Combining Eq. (21) and (22), a new relation can be formed:\n\n(23)\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\ns\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nC\nm\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\n\nnon\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nm\n\n\/\n\n\u03c1\nmon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, d\n\n001, s\n can be obtained from Eq.

(24). It is noted that, the basal spacing of saturated specimen in this study is adopted as the average of 5 slice when wetting duration is 240\u00a0h. It is obviously from Fig. 17 that, the predictions are overall bigger than the testing database. This is due to the assumption adopted in this study is that the volume change is only controlled by the volume change of inter-layer pore and ignored the swelling between particles. Meanwhile, as dry density increases, the gap between prediction and experimental data becomes smaller. This is because of the fact that inter-layer swelling is the main swelling mechanism for high dry density bentonite (e.g., Chen et al., 2019). The swelling of low dry density bentonite is dominated by both inter-layer swelling and inter-particle swelling (Zhu et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2018). At the same time, in order to obtain basal spacing of the specimen in saturation process, it is assumed herein that: the increase of basal spacing increases linearly with the degree of saturation. And, basal spacing in a certain volumetric water content (d\n\n001\n\n(\u03b8)) can be expressed as:\n\n(25)\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n\n\n\nS\nr\n\n=\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nd\n\n001\n,\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n\nd\n\n001\n,\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 18\n reveals basal spacing changing with degree of saturation from the tests above and its prediction with Eq. (25). It is noteworthy about Fig. 18 that the degree of saturation and basal spacing are the averages of five slices at a certain wetting duration. It is generally truth from Fig. 18 that, basal spacing increases with the increase of degree of saturation. Meanwhile, as Fig. 18 shows, the predictions with Eq. (25) are better in low degree of saturation range than those in high degree of saturation level. This is due to the fact that inter-layer swelling occurs before inter-particles swelling during saturation (Suzuki et al., 2005; Liu, 2013). At the beginning of hydration, there is only inter-layer swelling happening (e.g., Laird, 2006). As hydration develops, inter-particles swelling would join in (Yong, 1999a; Yong, 1999b).\n\n\n4.4\nDetermination for microporosity and macroporosity during saturation\nMontmorillonite microporosity (n\n\nmonmicro\n) can be expressed as the ratio of inter-layer pore volume (V\n\nil\n, Fig.16) to montmorillonite volume (V\n\nmon\n) as:\n\n(26)\n\n\nn\nmonmicro\n\n=\n\n\nV\nil\n\n\nV\nmon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from Fig. 16, V\n\nil\n can be given as:\n\n(27)\n\n\nV\nil\n\n=\nm\n\nS\nmont\n\n\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03b4\ns is the thickness of unit layer (9.6\u00a0\u00c5 from Komine and Ogata, 2004). And, montmorillonite volume can be presented as:\n\n(28)\n\n\nV\nmon\n\n=\nm\n\nS\nmont\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Eq. (26)\u2013(28), montmorillonite microporosity (n\n\nmonmicro\n) can be formed:\n\n(29)\n\n\nn\nmonmicro\n\n=\n\n\nm\n\nS\nmont\n\n\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\ns\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\nS\nmont\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4\ns\n\n\n\nd\n001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, the equation for calculating bentonite microporosity (n\n\nmicro\n) can be inspired by Eq. (17) from Komine and Ogata (1996) and Komine and Ogata (2004), as:\n\n(30)\n\n\nn\nmicro\n\n=\n\nn\nmonmicro\n\n\nC\nm\n\n+\n\nn\nnonmicro\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nC\nm\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere n\n\nnonmicro\n is the non-montmorillonite microporosity (=0). Since micro pore is defined as the montmorillonite inter-layer pore, n\n\nnonmicro\n is adopted as 0 in this study. n\n\nmicro\n can be regarded as the weighted average porosity of micro pore to bentonite. Macroporosity (n\n\nmacro\n) can be calculated from total porosity (n\n\ntotal\n):\n\n(31)\n\n\nn\ntotal\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\nd\n\n\nG\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(32)\n\n\nn\nmacro\n\n=\n\nn\ntotal\n\n\u2212\n\nn\nmicro\n\n\n\n\n\nAs reported by Sedighi and Thomas (2014), the interlayer space is always saturated. Therefore, the microvolumetric water content (\u03b8\n\nmicro\n) can be described as (Sedighi and Thomas, 2014):\n\n(33)\n\n\n\u03b8\nmicro\n\n=\n\nn\nmicro\n\n\n\n\n\nThe macrovolumetric water content can be given as shown below:\n\n(34)\n\n\n\u03b8\nmacro\n\n=\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nmicro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nComparisons between modified KC equation and testing data\n\nFig. 19\n presents saturated hydraulic conductivities of MX-80 (Pusch, 2001; Karnland et al., 2008; Komine, 2008; Komine, 2021), Kunigel-V1 (Pusch, 2001; Hasegawa, 2004; Komine, 2008; Sadamatsu, 2021) and Kunibon (Komine, 2008), and their predictions using traditional KC and modified KC equation in this study. Table 4\n listed physical properties values of three bentonites used in this study from literatures. From Table 1 and Table 4, it was found that the physical properties values of testing materials in the literatures are somewhat different from those in this study, especially the montmorillonite content of MX-80. Although it is bentonite of the same name, the difference in physical properties brought by the difference in excavation site is usual. In this section, for better certificating the validity of traditional and modified KC with testing database from literatures, the properties values of bentonites from literatures as Table 4 were adopted. It is apparently from Fig. 19, for all three bentonites, modified KC equation predicts much better than traditional KC equation.\nBasing on modified DDL theory (Komine and Ogata, 1996; Komine and Ogata, 2004), Komine (2008) proposed a predictive equation for saturated hydraulic conductivity of bentonites though assuming flow velocity of water between unit layers controls flow velocity of water in bentonite. That equation can be given as:\n\n(35)\n\n\nk\nsat\n\n=\n\n1\nCEC\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n\nNa\n+\n\n\nCa\n\n2\n+\n\n\n\nK\n+\n\n\nMg\n\n2\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXC\ni\n\n\nk\n\nsat\n,\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere k\nsat,i\n is hydraulic conductivity of exchangeable cation i; EXC\n\ni\n is exchange capacity of the exchangeable cation i; and CEC is cation exchange capacity of bentonite. As can be seen from Fig. 19\n(a), modified KC equation predicts the testing saturated hydraulic conductivities of MX-80 from Karnland et al. (2008), Komine (2008) and Komine (2021) well in the range of total dry density. The modified DDL equation performs better in high dry density range (\u03c1\nd\u00a0>\u00a01.6\u00a0Mg\/m3) than low dry density range. However, neither modified KC equation and modified DDL equation can fit the saturated hydraulic conductivities from Pusch (2001) well. Regarding Kunigel-V1, in Fig. 19\n(b), the predictive value from modified KC is bigger than experimental results of Hasegawa (2004), Komine (2008) and Sadamatsu (2021). And, predictive value is smaller than the results from Pusch (2001). The modified DDL equation predicts Kunigel-V1 saturated hydraulic conductivities from Hasegawa (2004), Komine (2008) and Sadamatsu (2021) well in high dry density range (\u03c1\nd\u00a0>\u00a01.6\u00a0Mg\/m3). In the low dry density range (\u03c1\n\nd\n\u00a0<\u00a01.6\u00a0Mg\/m3), the prediction from modified DDL equation is smaller than those testing data. Meanwhile, the modified DDL equation predictive value is much smaller than Pusch (2001). From Fig. 19\n(c), both modified KC and modified DDL equations predict saturated hydraulic conductivities of Kunibon from Komine (2008) pretty well.\n\nFig. 11 reveals hydraulic conductivity changing with volumetric water content for bentonites, and its prediction by modified KC equation using new relative permeability (\u0398\n\nmacro\n). Herein, bentonites physical properties values in this study as Table 1 were used to verify the accuracy of prediction. It can be easily found from Fig. 11, for all three bentonites, experimental database show \u201c\u0548\u201d shapes while the predictions exhibit more standard curves. This is due to the fact that the bentonite microstructure evolutions during saturation as introduced before was not taken into consideration. However, overall, the modified KC equation and new relative permeability can predict the hydraulic conductivities of unsaturated bentonites.\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nBoth experimental observations and prediction modification were carried out in this study. A new multi-ring was used with the instantaneous profiling method to obtain hydraulic conductivity and basal spacing under confined wetting. Conclusions of this study includes the followings:\n1) Hydraulic conductivities of unsaturated bentonites exhibit \u201c\u0548\u201d shapes with the increase of volumetric water content.\n2) Basal spacings of bentonites increase dramatically with the increase of wetting time in beginning wetting durations, and then enter into stable values. Basal spacing rises as degree of saturation grows.\n3) A dual pore system was introduced as: i) micro pore (inter-layer pore); and ii) macro pore (pores excluding inter-layer pore). By the discussion of water flow mechanism in the pores of bentonite, it was assumed that water flows in the macro pore. A modified KC equation was proposed by changing porosity and tortuosity of saturated total pore to porosity and tortuosity of saturated macro pore in traditional Kozeny-Carmen (KC) eq. A new relative permeability was also raised to calculate hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated bentonite. Modified KC and new relative permeability can generally predict hydraulic conductivity under confined wetting well.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nKunlin Ruan: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

However, the deformation mechanism of eastern Tibet is a hot debate. The rigid block model predicts that the deformation of the plateau has dominantly been accommodated by the block boundary faults (e.g., Avouac et al., 1993; Tapponnier and Molnar, 1977), whereas the continuous model proposes that the strain is partitioned throughout the entire plateau (e.g., England et al., 1988; England and Molnar, 1997; Houseman and England, 1993). The major controversy of these two end-member models has focused on whether the role of intra-block faults in the deformation distribution of the plateau is major (e.g., M\u00e9riaux et al., 2004) or limited (e.g., Cowgill et al., 2009; Gold et al., 2011). Although decades of geodetic data reveal distributed deformation all over the plateau and seem to sustain the continuous model (Zhang et al., 2004), the stations are too sparse to well resolve the strain rate on an individual fault. Moreover, the geodetic rate only represents an inter-seismic present-day rate of far-field strain accumulation on an active fault (Donnellan et al., 1993). Emerging evidence of the considerable discrepancy of the fault slip rates over geological and decadal scales (e.g., Chevalier et al., 2005; Mohadjer et al., 2017) reflects that the late Quaternary activities of intra-block faults in the Tibetan Plateau are crucial to getting deeper insights into how continental crust deforms in response to outward motion of the plateau.\nEastern Tibet is characterized by clockwise rotation of the Qiangtang-Chuandian block around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis illustrated by the GPS velocity field (Fig. 1). The ongoing Sichuan-Tibet Railway traverses the Qiangtang-Chuandian block and crosses several intra-block faults (Fig. 1). These intra-block faults are also active in the late Quaternary and have undergone numerous strong earthquakes, such as the 1948\u00a0M 7.3 earthquake on the Litang fault and the 1870\u00a0M 7\u00bd earthquake on the Batang fault (Fig. 1). The northern LCJF, one of the important intra-block faults west of Jinsha River (Fig. 1), runs across the railway south of Changdu City. But its detailed geometry and late Quaternary activity are absent. Knowing whether the northern LCJF has the seismic potential similar to large earthquakes on the Batang and Litang faults is vital to this major engineering design (e.g., Ho et al., 2020; Kanaori, 2000; McCalpin, 2009; Tiwari et al., 2021) and the understanding of the kinematic pattern of eastern Tibet. Therefore, it is imperative to study the late Quaternary activity of the northern LCJF and assess surface faulting hazards via a geological technique.\nIn this study, we use the interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, field observations, and shallow geophysical exploration to determine the geometry of the northern LCJF. Furthermore, we combine optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), radiocarbon, and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN) exposure dating methods, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey of displaced landforms to constrain the fault slip rates in the late Quaternary. Finally, we explore the role of the LCJF in strain partitioning of eastern Tibet and assess the seismic hazards on the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. This work will provide essential quantitative data for seismic hazard assessment on the railway and enhance understanding of the Tibetan Plateau's deformation mechanism.\n\n\n2\nRegional tectonics and LCJF zone\nEastern Tibet is characterized by interior material eastward movement of the plateau and several blocks separated by large-scale strike-slip fault zones (Fig. 1). Among these blocks, the Qiangtang-Chuandian block was proposed as the most outward extrusion of the plateau's material. Its influence has even reached southeast Tibet and SE Asia (Clark and Royden, 2000; Tapponnier et al., 1982; Wang and Burchfiel, 2000). This block is primarily expressed by distributed faults and localized low-velocity zones in the mid-lower crust (e.g., Bai et al., 2010; Oskin, 2012; Royden et al., 1997). The northern and southern boundaries of the Qiangtang-Chuandian block are left-lateral Ganzi-Xianshuihe and right-lateral Jiali fault systems marked by strong shear structures in the Cenozoic (Fig. 1) (Allen et al., 1991; Bai et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2018; Chevalier et al., 2017; Wang and Burchfiel, 2000).\nThe Ganzi-Xianshuihe fault zone defines the northern boundary of the Qingtang-Chuandian block (Fig. 1). It is seismically active and has undergone over ten large earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a0~7) in the historical record (Bai et al., 2018; Wang and Burchfiel, 2000). For instance, the 1896\u00a0M 7 earthquake ruptured the Ganzi fault with a late Quaternary slip rate of 6\u20138\u00a0mm\/yr (Chevalier et al., 2017), and the 2010 Yushu earthquake (Mw 6.9) produced a\u00a0~\u00a050\u00a0km long surface rupture zone (Chen et al., 2010) along the northern branch of Ganzi fault zone with a late Quaternary rate of ~4.1\u00a0mm\/yr (Li et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). The Xianshuihe fault with a left-slip rate of ~10\u00a0mm\/yr during late Quaternary (Bai et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2018) has been ruptured by a series of large earthquakes, such as the 1973 Luhuo earthquake (Ms 7.6), with a surface rupture of ~90\u00a0km long (Deng and Zhang, 1984), and 1955 Zheduotang quake with the re-evaluated magnitude of Mw 7.0 and a\u00a0~\u00a043\u00a0km-long surface rupture (Yan et al., 2020) (Fig. 1). The Jiali-Red River fault zone defines the southern boundary of the Qiangtang-Chuandian block. The Jiali fault is active in the Holocene via paleoseismic trenching (Wang et al., 2020) and has a dextral rate of ~3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr by the geodetic study of Zhang et al. (2021).\nThe LCJF west of Jinsha River is poorly investigated due to a deep incision. The regional geological investigations in the end of last century indicated that the fault zone consists of breccia, mylonite, and Oriented minerals (Ma, 1992). The dip angle of the fault is generally ~70\u00b0-80\u00b0, and striation data show a dominant lateral motion with a reverse component. Recent preliminary field observations for some engineering projects showed displaced Quaternary alluvial gravel in fault exposures. They suggested that the southern LCJF might have undergone strong activities in the Quaternary (Rongjun Zhou, 2020, personal communication). But the detailed geometry and slip rate of this fault remains unknown.\nThe entire LCJF zone underwent a low seismic activity. No large earthquake bigger than 7.0 has occurred since 1900\u00a0CE (Huang et al., 1994) (Fig. 1). The bigger earthquakes in the north part are the 1971\u00a0M 6.5 earthquake and the 1951\u00a0M 6.0 earthquake. The other two strong earthquakes along its southern part are the 1920\u00a0M 6 and 2013\u00a0M 6.1 Zuogong earthquakes. In addition, moderate earthquakes with magnitudes <6.0 occur occasionally. The focal mechanism of the 2013 earthquake indicates normal faulting with a left-lateral component (Fig. 1).\nThe northern LCJF primarily runs along the Lancangjing River (Fig. 1). Strong downcutting in the high-relief topography has removed the displaced landforms along the fault trace. However, east of Jitang Town, Changdu City, high-resolution satellite imagery reveals a clear faulted landform (Fig. 2\n). The northern LCJF trends NW and consists primarily of two branches: the BLF in the north and YYF in the south (Fig. 2). The two branches probably merged eastwards onto the LCJF. This study focuses on these two fault branches and analyzes their activities in the late Quaternary.\nThe YYF locates on the upper reach of the flat Yu Qu (\u201cQu\u201d means \u201criver\u201d in Chinese) basin (Fig. 2). The Changdu Bamda airport, known as the second-highest airport globally with an elevation of 4334\u00a0m above sea level in eastern Tibet, situates in this basin. No river terrace is developed along the braided Yu Qu due to little downcutting, whereas alluvial fans are generally distributed at the intersections of Yu Qu and its tributaries (Fig. 2). The BLF runs along the southern piedmont of Se Qu, one important tributary to the Lancangjiang River (Fig. 2). Numerous streams, such as Gongduoxiong (GDX) Qu, cut the mountains in the southwest and flow into the Se Qu. At least five terraces are well developed along the Se Qu, whereas only one terrace forms along these narrow streams.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\n\n3.1\nSurvey of displaced landforms\nAlong the YYF, the fault cuts through the slope and alluvial fan. No terrace is developed along the stream channel. While along the BLF, terraces are well preserved along the main river. Strath terraces and fault scarps at each site can be identified and mapped in the field aided by Google Earth imagery. Terrace surfaces of different ages were designated numerically, with numbers increasing with age, such that the T0 surface represents the floodplain, with subsequent numbers (T1 through T4) indicating progressively older terrace surfaces. Therefore, numerous displaced alluvial fans and terraces can be used to reconstruct the fault offset.\nIn order to measure the fault offset, we adopt two techniques to survey the displaced landforms. For the sites with less vegetation, we introduced the DJI Phantom 4 RTK drone and photogrammetry with a centimeter-level accuracy to survey the areas of offset markers. The resolution (generally ~1\u20132\u00a0cm) of the UAV digital elevation model (DEM) is high enough to recognize microrelief features related to linear markers such as terrace riser and channel. For the sites with dense trees, the photogrammetry is not appliable. We conduct the survey of offset landforms by the Trimble R10 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS with the accuracy of 2\u20133\u00a0cm horizontally and 10\u00a0cm vertically in the field.\n\n\n3.2\nAge determination\nTo constrain the age of offset landforms, we use the following three dating techniques in this study. At some sites, multiple approaches are used to crosscheck the age.\nOSL samples were collected by stainless steel tubes of 5\u00a0cm in diameter and\u00a0~\u00a020\u00a0cm long. The sampling sites were first dug deep into over 30\u00a0cm to avoid the possible post-deposition bleaching. Once extracted, the tubes were sealed immediately using aluminum foil and tape to keep moisture and avoid daylight exposure. The samples were treated at the Luminescence Dating Laboratory at the Key Laboratory of Crustal Dynamics, MEMC. To obtain the concentration of radioisotopes for dose-rate determination, ~20\u00a0g of sediment was ground into a fine powder for instrumental neutron activation analysis. Following the procedures of Lu et al. (2007) and Wang et al. (2010), uranium and thorium contents were measured by ELEMENT Plasma Mass Spectrometer. The luminescence signals were tested using a Riso TL\/OSL DA-20 reader. All OSL signals were measured using a photomultiplier tube (9235QB). The equivalent dose (De) measurements were determined on multiple aliquots using the Simplified Multiple Aliquot Regenerative-dose (SMAR) protocol. Growth curves were fitted by exponential trend curves. Aliquots with >5% recuperation were not involved in the age estimations.\nRadiocarbon samples were collected by a knife and packed with aluminum foil in the field. These labeled samples were then placed in zip lock bags and delivered to the Beta Analytic lab for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The related treatment sequences can be found on the link (https:\/\/www.radiocarbon.cn\/beta-AMS-lab\/). The final results were calibrated using OxCal 4.4 based on IntCal 20 curve (Reimer et al., 2020).\nTCN Samples were collected from fan surface cobbles for Be-10 dating. Whole cobbles were taken because boulders on the fan surfaces were absent. The location, geomorphic setting, size, shape, and weathering characteristics of each sample were recorded. The inclination from the sampling site to the surrounding horizon was measured to quantify topographic shielding, which in most sites was generally negligible. Cobble samples were crushed and sieved to obtain a fraction of 250\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm size. The chemical treatments followed the procedures of Le Dortz et al. (2011) and Owen et al. (2011). Chemical treatments of samples were done at the Preparation Lab for Cosmogenic Nuclides, MEMC. AMS measurements were made at the Xi'an Accelerator Mass Spectrometer Center at the Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n3.3\nSlip rate estimation\nThe vertical slip rate of a fault can be calculated by the ratio of vertical offset on the terrace tread and associated terrace age. The horizontal slip rate often relies on a displaced terrace riser. The horizontal offset is generally obtained based on a detailed survey of displaced landform. We adopted Gold et al. (2011)\u2019s method that uses the projection for each riser crest on the fault trace to estimate the minimum and maximum displacements. For the offset fan, we reconstruct the original shape of the fan and the typical features to constrain the fault offset. The reported offset includes the mean between the minimum and maximum values, with an uncertainty that is one-half the range.\nBecause fault slip rate estimates are also uncertain, we estimate slip rates and corresponding uncertainties by the Zechar and Frankel (2009)\u2019s technique in which age, offset, and slip rate at each study site are treated and reported in the light of probability distribution. The slip rate is obtained by convolution via the probability distributions of offset and corresponding age. This approach has been applied to the estimation of well-constrained slip rates on numerous faults (e.g., Chevalier et al., 2017; Fletcher et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2013). Here, we introduce this approach to determine the fault slip rate and related uncertainty.\n\n\n3.4\nAudio-frequency magnetotelluric (AMT) exploration of active fault\nIn some sites, displaced landforms are clear, but the dip direction of the fault is hard to determine. In this study, we introduce the AMT method to detect the shallow structure of the fault zone. It can help us verify the location and slip sense of the fault. This technique is based on the distribution of electrical resistivity in the subsurface by relating simultaneous measurements of the naturally occurring fluctuations of the electric and magnetic fields ranging roughly from 1\u00a0Hz to 10\u00a0kHz at the surface (Chave and Jones, 2012; Nabighian, 1993). It has been widely used in shallow structure exploration of sediments and faults (e.g., Blake et al., 2016; Seki et al., 2021; Uhm et al., 2021).\nIn our field measurements, the data were collected at roughly 10\u201330\u00a0m intervals along the profile perpendicular to the fault trace. Only the horizontal electrical (Ex, Ey) and magnetic (Hx, Hy) fields were recorded due to field topography. The AMT data were measured using the Stratagem EH4 system manufactured by Geometrics, recording in a frequency range from 10 to 105\u00a0Hz. The data acquisition duration was about 20\u201330\u00a0min at each site. We used the software package IMAGEM (EH4) for data processing (Simpson and Bahr, 2005). Most of our data were high-quality with small error bars and low scattering, while few stations recorded poor data due to strong ambient and electromagnetic noise. Finally, two-dimensional inversion was carried out using the software of IMAGEM.\n\n\n\n4\nLate Quaternary activity of the YYF\n\n4.1\nFault geometry\nThe WNW-trending YYF extends from Xieba Village in the east through Kongxie Village, Yangda Village, and Guoqing Town to Dumula Village and the upper reach of Wei Qu (Fig. 2). West of Wei Qu, the relatively clear fault trace becomes obscure. So, we infer that the YYF is ~80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0km long from Xieba Village in the east to Dumala Village in the west. The ~1\u20131.5\u00a0km wide stepover might be the boundary between the YYF and the fault farther west of Wei Qu (Fig. 2).\nThe eastern segment of the YYF extends along the Xue Qu and is expressed by shutter ridges, ly fault springs, and linear throughs (Fig. 3a, b). Especially west of Kongxie Village, the fault is composed of clear right-stepping surface ruptures and left-laterally displaced features (Fig. 3c). The rupture zone is bare or sparsely vegetated. In addition, clear free faces are developed along the fault trace (Fig. 3d). These features indicate that the last event on the YYF occurred not long ago.\nIn the west segment, the fault locates the piedmont on the northern side of Wei Qu and is marked by linear fault troughs on the slope and laterally offset gullies (Fig. 4a,c). The fault zone consists of sag ponds and fault scarps on the frontal fan (Fig. 4a,b). The sites of sag ponds are more vegetated and darker in the image due to local ponding providing good conditions for vegetation. At gully g3, two fans are well developed at its outlet (Fig. 4a). The older fan 2 is displaced left-laterally by the YYF and blocks gully g1-g2 forming typical shutter ridges. Based on the g3 channel, we can restore the left-lateral slip of ~400\u00a0m (Fig. 4a). To the east of g1, the fault comprises at least three linear troughs on the slope (Fig. 4a).\nThe central YYF crosses a series of alluvial fans (Fig. 2) and produces a distinct linear fault trace (Fig. 5\n). West of Quoqing Town, a small pull-apart basin is expressed by a small lake (Fig. 5a). East of Guoqing Town, the linear fault trace is prominent because of the totally different tone on the surface, especially around the Gang fan. A small wetland is probably a sag pond due to the left-laterally displaced fan west of Gang fan. East of Gang fan, the fault runs through the mountain slope, which is marked by offset gullies, fault throughs, and filled sag ponds (Fig. 5a). East of Yangda Village, the YYF is characterized by a north-facing scarp on the Yangda fan (Fig. 5b).\nOn the whole, the YYF is characterized by distinct linear features. We mapped the detailed fault traces (Fig. 2). The central fault cut the Gang and Yangda fans and generated a remarkable displaced landform (Fig. 5) suitable for studying the late Quaternary activity of the YYF.\n\n\n4.2\nGang fan site (96.9402\u00b0E, 30.7128\u00b0N)\nAt the intersection of the Gang Qu and Yu Qu, the flat Gang fan is well developed (Figs. 2, 5a). The YYF runs across the middle part of the Gang fan and produces a linear north-facing scarp. The northern side of the YYF is relatively lower and is presently occupied by a local swamp (Fig. 5a). The gullies on the southern side of the fault (Fig. 6b,c) suggest that the swamp could have been overflowed during wet seasons. The fault is clearly expressed by the boundary of the alluvial fan and swamp (Figs. 6a, 7a). Detailed mapping of the YYF indicates that the fault trace consists of right- and left-stepping surface ruptures (Fig. 6c). Interestingly, some cobbles on the fan surface are vertically oriented along the fault strike (Fig. 7b). In the surface rupture zone, we can see some sub-circular sand units on the extensional fissures. In addition, some ground cracks are still readily recognized and are sub-parallel to the main fault trace (Fig. 7c), implying that the most recent event on the YYF did not take place long ago.\nSatellite imagery reveals that the well-preserved shape of Gang fan and the Gang Qu channel provide ideal piercing lines to reconstruct the horizontal displacement of the YYF (Fig. 5a). We restore the topographic cross-sections of the entire fan and channel features on both sides of the fault by back-slipping one side of the features relative to the other. To reduce the effect of the swamp, we conducted the UAV survey of the offset Gang fan in the winter (Fig. 6a).\nOur interpretation of high-resolution UAV data reveals that the deformation zone on the YYF is generally <50\u00a0m. So, we produce the north and south profiles on both sides of the fault at 30\u00a0m distance from the central fault line to determine (Fig. 6b). These two topographic cross-sections are extracted to compare the shape of the Gang fan (Figs. 6b, 8a). The topographic cross-sections of the entire fan are restored at ~33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0m (Fig. 8b), and the reconstruction of Gang Qu channel yields a left-lateral offset of ~47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0m (Fig. 8c). We thus propose that the horizontal displacement on the Gang fan is ~33\u201347\u00a0m.\nIn order to determine the age of the Gang fan, we opened an exposure at the left bank of the Gang Qu on the northern side of the YYF (Fig. 6c). The strata in this exposure include four units (Fig. 8d). The uppermost layer (U1) is turf with plenty of grassroots related to the present-day swamp. Below U1 is a blackish peat layer (U2) ~75\u00a0cm thick, associated with the swamp. The lower parts are alluvial sediments of the Gang fan and consist of yellowish flood plain sand with pebbles (U3) and channel facies alluvial gravel (U4) (Fig. 8d), probably presenting the alluvial process of the fan. An OSL sample (YQO3) from an interbed sand lens in the upper part of U4 yields the age of 34.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.17\u00a0ka, and another OSL sample (YQO4) from the bottom of U3 is dated to be 15.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.83\u00a0ka (Fig. 8d, Table 1\n). The organic sediment (YQC3) from the bottom of U2 is dated to be 12,720\u201312,660\u00a0cal BP, whereas another organic sediment sample (YQC2) from the same layer of sample YQO4 yields an age of 15,920\u201315,650\u00a0cal BP (Fig. 8d, Table 2\n), in accordance with sample YQO4. The consistent crosscheck and the good stratigraphic order of these dates demonstrated that our ages are reliable. Because the fan was abandoned after the deposition of U4 and subsequently covered by U3, the age of Gang fan predates U3 and postdates U4 (Fig. 8e). So, the Gang fan formed at ~15.92\u201334.62\u00a0ka. Given that the samples (YQC2 and YQO4) from U3 are closer to the top of alluvial gravel (U4) than sample YQO3, we infer that the age of the Gang fan might be closer to ~15.92\u00a0ka.\nFour TCN samples were also taken at the Gang fan site (Fig. 6c). Among them, three cobble samples (YQB1-YQB3) were collected from the fan surface. These sampling sites avoid eroded areas such as gully valleys and swampy zone to reduce the effect of possible erosion and subsequent cover. One sample (YQB4) was taken from the active streambed of the Gang Qu to estimate the inherited component (Fig. 6c), as illustrated by Brown et al. (1998). Sample YQB4 yields a high 10Be concentration for the active channel (Table 3\n), indicating that the inherited component for the flat and gentle fan like Gang fan may not be ignorable.\nGiven that the pre-depositional history of the cobbles from the present streambed is comparable to that of the cobbles taken from the abandoned Gang fan surface during aggradation periods, we propose that the inherited components from the streambed and fan surface might be similar, as described by Le Dortz et al. (2011). We subtract the inherited component of the streambed from the 10Be concentration of the samples on the Gang fan to estimate their exposure ages. Our final dating results indicate that samples YQB1 and YQB3 are apparently younger than sample YQB2 (Table 3).\nBecause the slope wash from the upper reach of Gang Qu will continue to erode the fan surface after the fan formation, this process will make the north side of the YYF more eroded. This may be the reason that sample YQB1 is obviously younger than others (Fig. 6c). But samples YQB2 and YQB3 lie south of the YYF, where the flow from the upper reach would be blocked by the fault scarp. The south side of the fault would be protected from the slope wash from the upper reach. With the distance away from the scarp, the slope wash will be stronger (Fig. 6c). Given that sample YQB3 is close to Gang Qu, and a big gully (Fig. 6c), the site of sample YQB3 is more readily to be eroded than that of sample YQB2. This may address why sample YQB1 is a little younger than sample YQB2. So the result of sample YQB2 (18,390\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01642\u00a0yrs) might represent the age of the Gang fan (Table 3), in line with the inference from the exposure in Fig. 8d. Therefore, we propose that the Gang fan probably formed at ~18.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.64\u00a0ka.\nIt is to note that the northern and southern sides of the YYF have different deposits (Fig. 7). Its southern side is exposed by alluvial gravel, but the alluvial gravel on its northern side is mantled by alluvial sand and subsequent marsh deposits (Fig. 8d). This should be related to the vertical activity of the YYF. When the fan was abandoned and uplifted above the water level, the displacement of the fault began to be preserved. The southern side of the YYF was uplifted, whereas its northern side was relatively subsided. The local lowland on the northern side would start to pond and deposit the peat, and alluvial sand on the south side would be removed by slope wash (Fig. 8e). Thus, the vertical displacement of the YYF on the Gang fan might be 115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0cm constrained by the thickness of the units above U4, and the thickness of U3 in Fig. 8d. Given the possible erosion on the south side of the fault, this vertical displacement should be the minimum value.\n\n\n4.3\nYangda fan site (97.0456\u00b0E, 30.6871\u00b0N)\nEast of Yangda Village, the YYF crosses the Yangda fan and generates a WNW-trending linear strike-slip fault trace (Fig. 5b). Similar to the features at the Gang fan site, the fault trace is marked by the main scarp accompanied by a fold on the southern side of the fault (Fig. 9\n). The ground cracks on the axis of the fold can be identified in the field.\nOn the east side of the new road from the photovoltaic power station to Yangda Village, a fault exposure indicates that the fan deposits consist of six units near the fold axis (Figs. 5b, 9). The bottom part (U6) is brown alluvial gravel with horizontal bedding. U5 is composed by brown coarse-fine sand with gravel clasts and horizontal bedding. The lower part of the exposure (U5-U6) represents the deposits of the Yangda fan. U4 is the poorly sorted gravels probably attributed to post-faulting rapid colluvium from alluvial gravels. U3 is the yellowish-green silt that might be related to a post-faulting ponding. U2 is a poorly bedded, grayish gravel layer and is possibly associated with a flood event. The top part (U1) is the widespread turf. An OSL sample (YQO5) from the lower U5 yields an age of 30.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.33\u00a0ka, and another OSL sample (YQO6) from the central part of U3 is dated to be 7.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.69\u00a0ka (Fig. 9c, Table 1). The fault planes are characterized by oriented clasts (Fig. 9b). The fault zone is composed of several faults (f1-f3) and forms a small graben. These faults obviously displaced U3 (Fig. 9b), indicating that YYF underwent surface faulting after ~7.8\u00a0ka.\n\n\n\n5\nLate Quaternary activity of the BLF\n\n5.1\nFault geometry\nThe NNW-striking BLF crosses the area with high relief and deep valleys. It goes through the western slope of the Se Qu from east of Xieba Village through Jitang Town and merges with the YYF eastwards onto the LCJF (Fig. 2). Farther north of Lezhu bend and southeast of Lezhu bend, the fault is characterized by linear fault troughs (Fig. 10\n). It is hard to identify the continuous fault trace similar to the YYF.\nThe BLF crosses numerous northeast-trending ephemeral streams that drain into the Se Qu. Although laterally offset landforms along the BLF become inconspicuous due to strong downcutting of these streams (Fig. 2), the scarps on bedrock interfluves define the fault trace. Terraces are not well developed in these gullies, and only terrace T1 is available in most channels. Our field investigations indicate that offset landforms in the Gongduoxiong (GDX) Qu and at the Lezhu bend (Fig. 2) are well developed, offering datable displacement markers for late Quaternary slip rate of the BLF.\n\n\n5.2\nGDX site (97.3301\u00b0E, 30.7098\u00b0N)\nThe GDX Qu is a tributary to the Se Qu west of Jitang Town (Fig. 2). Terrace T1 is preserved only on the left bank and is presently occupied by farmlands (Fig. 11a). The flat flood plain (T0) on the left bank is wider than that on the right bank. Additionally, talus fans are developed on the right bank because of its steeper slope.\nThe BLF cuts the GDX Qu and produces distinct displaced landforms (Fig. 11). On the right bank, the fault cuts a talus fan and generates a pronounced scarp on the fan surface (Fig. 12a). On the left bank, the fault is marked by apparent scarps on T0 and T1 (Fig. 11a, c). Moreover, the T1\/T0 riser is sinistrally offset by the fault (Fig. 11a).\nWe employ RTK to survey the offset landforms at the GDX site because of its dense trees and high-relief topography. The topographic profile on T0 yields a vertical offset of 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0m, and that on T1 shows its vertical displacement of 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0m (Fig. 11b). Due to human terracing, the T1\/T0 riser was too modified to determine the accurate locus of the riser. Here we use the middle line of the T1\/T0 riser to estimate the horizontal offset of ~4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0m (Fig. 11a).\nIn order to determine the ages of T1 and T0, we dug two pits at their frontal risers. The T0 deposits consist of 4\u00a0units (Fig. 12b). The bottom alluvial gravel (U4) and overlying alluvial sand (U3) constitute the alluvial sediments of the GDX Qu and are covered by subsequent grayish loess (U2) and cultivated soil (U1). A charcoal sample (SQC14) from the lower U1 yields an age of 285\u20130\u00a0cal BP, and two charcoal samples (SQC13 and SQC11) from the middle and lower parts of U2 were dated to be 540\u2013505\u00a0cal BP and 655\u2013535\u00a0cal BP (Fig. 12b, Table 2), respectively. The age of the lower part of U2 is 660\u2013645\u00a0cal BP based on the radiocarbon dating of sample SQC10. An OSL sample (SQO13) collected from the lower part of U2 yields an age of 0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0ka (Fig. 12b, Table 1), consistent with the radiocarbon ages. These dating results are in good stratigraphic order and demonstrate that T0 formed probably at ~0.66\u00a0ka.\nThe T1 deposits have similar features to T0 (Fig. 12c). The lower two layers (U4 and U3) are alluvium of GDX Qu, and the upper two layers (U2 and U1) are subsequent loess and cultivated layer. An organic sample (SQC8) from the bottom of U2 yields an age of 1390\u20131300\u00a0cal BP, and another radiocarbon sample (SQC9) from the middle of U3 is estimated to be 1410\u20131310\u00a0cal BP (Fig. 12b, Table 2). Thus, we propose that the age of terrace T1 is ~1.4\u00a0ka.\nThe exposure of the talus fan on the right bank of GDX Qu uncovers the fault plane (Fig. 12a). The fault displaced the interlayer (U2) of sand with gravel and is characterized by orientated clasts. The locus of the fault plane is consistent with the scarp on the talus fan (Fig. 12a), suggesting that the faulting occurred after the formation of the talus fan.\n\n\n5.3\nLezhu site (97.2404\u00b0E, 30.8429\u00b0N)\nAt the Lezhu bend ~15\u00a0km NW of Jitang Town, the northeast-trending Se Qu turns northwest and forms the big Lezhu bend (Figs. 2, 10). Four terraces are developed on the right bank of the Se Qu, and only two narrow terrace treads are preserved due to lateral erosion on its left bank (Fig. 13b).\nThe BLF crosses the southwest shoulder of the Se Qu and crosses the river. Several gullies from the slope flow into the Se Qu. On the right bank, the BLF cuts the interfluves and generates shutter ridges (Figs. 13b, 14a). At the convex bank of the river bend, terraces T3 and T4 are well preserved, and several alluvial fans from the gullies on the right slope cover these terraces (Fig. 13b). The BLF displaced terraces T3 and T4 and the overlying alluvial fan and formed distinct linear scarps (Figs. 13b, 14). Due to the cover of the subsequent fan, the scarp height decreases toward the river channel (Fig. 14a). In addition, the T4\/T3 riser is sinistrally and vertically offset by the fault (Fig. 14b). High-resolution topographic data show that the scarps on T4 and T3 are ~9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0m and\u00a0~\u00a05.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 14c). The high-resolution satellite image indicates that the T4\/T3 riser was left-laterally displaced by ~12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0m (Fig. 13c). It is to note that terrace T3 close to the BLF on the southern side of the fault is poorly preserved due to narrow tread and bank sloughing.\nIn order to date terrace T4, we dug a pit on the tread (Fig. 14b). The pit reveals a typical alluvial sedimentary sequence. Its upper part is composed of yellowish alluvial sand, and its lower part consists of alluvial gravel with the sand lens. An OSL sample (LZO1) from the uppermost lens of alluvial gravel yields an age of 7.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99\u00a0ka (Fig. 14b, Table 1). We did not take any dating sample from the alluvial sand layer. Because the upper sand is only ~15\u201320\u00a0cm thick, it is not appliable for OSL dating. The abundant roots make it unsuitable for radiocarbon dating. Terrace T3 consists of alluvial gravel, which makes us hard to seek the datable material. Our dating result of terrace T4 is consistent with the regional terrace sequence of Lancangjiang River (Wei, 2016). Based on the above statement, we propose that our dating result could represent the minimum age of terrace T4.\nTo determine the existence and dip direction of the BLF, two AMT sections (WT1 and WT2) were conducted across the possible fault trace. Section WT1 was along a ridge southeast of the Lezhu bend, and section WT2 was on the flood plain of the left bank (Fig. 13b). Both sections reveal that the BLF fault at the surface is characterized by a similar electrical structure and a sharp contrast of electrical resistivity at depth (Fig. 15\n). The similar surface lithology is consistent with the geological features (Fig. 2). The deep structures discover that there is a fault with a SW dip direction, coinciding with the downward projection of the surface trace of the BLF determined by displaced landforms (Fig. 13b) and the dip direction of fault exposure at the GDX site (Fig. 12a).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSlip rate of the northern LCJF and associated seismic potential\nThe northern LCJF consists of two branches: YYF and BLF. The YYF is primarily a left-lateral strike-slip fault with a minor reverse component, whereas the BLF undergoes a left-lateral and reverse motion. We employed the measured offsets and marker ages to determine the fault slip rate. At the Gang fan site, the fan age (~18.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.64\u00a0ka) and horizontal fault displacement (33\u201347\u00a0m) yield a sinistral slip rate of ~2.2\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.5\u00a0mm\/yr for the YYF. Additionally, the vertical displacement of the fan is ~1.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0m, revealing a vertical slip rate of ~0.1\u00a0+\u00a00.0\/\u22120.0\u00a0mm\/yr for the YYF.\nFor the BLF, we conducted two sites for slip rate estimation. At the GDX site, the ~0.66\u00a0ka flood plain (T0) was vertically displaced by ~1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0m, indicating a vertical rate of ~1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mm\/yr. The ~1.4\u00a0ka terrace T1 and its vertical offset of ~2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0m yield a vertical rate of ~1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm\/yr. Meanwhile, the left-lateral offset on the T1\/T0 riser is 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0m. Considering that the GDX Qu has limited flux, we use the age (~1.4\u00a0ka) of terrace T1 as the riser age to calculate a horizontal slip rate of ~2.9\u00a0+\u00a00.8\/\u22120.7\u00a0mm\/yr. At the Lezhu site, terrace T4 was dated to be ~7.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99\u00a0ka. The ~9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0m scarp on terrace T4 yields a vertical slip rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.2\u00a0mm\/yr. If we assign the age of terrace T4 to the T4\/T3 riser, the left-lateral slip (12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0m) on the T4\/T3 riser will generate a horizontal slip rate of ~1.5\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.4\u00a0mm\/yr for the BLF. Given that the T4\/T3 riser should be younger than terrace T4, and the offset on the T4\/T3 riser is smaller than the true offset due to lateral erosion of the riser on the northern side of the BLF, this horizontal rate should be a minimum value.\nOf particular note is a big difference in the horizontal slip rate at the two sites for the BLF. The rate at the GDX site nearly doubles that at the Lezhu site. Two reasons may address this difference. Firstly, large earthquakes on the BLF might fit a cluster model rather than a quasi-periodic model. The T1 age (~1.4\u00a0ka) is within the last active period where the BLF will have a higher slip rate, whereas the age of ~7.9\u00a0ka includes multiple active and quiescent cycles, as illustrated on other faults via morphotectonic and paleoseismological studies (e.g., Benedetti et al., 2013; Mart\u00edn-Banda et al., 2021). The rate at the Lezhu site may represent a long-term slip rate on the BLF, and the rate at the GDX site is a short-term rate. Secondly, the short elapsed time since the last event may increase the short-term rate. The scarp on T0 indicates that the last faulting on the BLF occurred after ~0.66\u00a0ka. Considering the ~1.4\u00a0ka age of terrace T1, the younger age of the last event will add the rate as the general method of slip rate estimation. If we subtract the scarp height of T0 at the GDX site from vertical offsets on T1 at the GDX site and T4 at the Lezhu site, then the long-term vertical slip rate will be estimated to be ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.2\u00a0mm\/yr for the BLF. Similarly, its long-term horizontal rate can be calculated at ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.5\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr. These new estimates are a little slower than those by the general approach. Thus, these two reasons might together have increased the estimated slip rates. We propose that these new rate estimates might represent the long-term rate of the BLF.\nThe northern LCJF zone comprises the NWW-striking YYF and NW-striking BLF that merged eastwards onto one main fault trace (Fig. 2). Generally, the BLF strikes N40\u00b0W, and the YYF strikes N75\u00b0W, whereas the BCJF has a strike direction of N55\u00b0W. At the triple junction of these faults, we assume a balance of slip rate vectors (Fig. 16\n). The YYF is a left-lateral strike-slip fault with a horizontal rate of ~2.2\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.5\u00a0mm\/yr and a negligible vertical rate of ~0.1\u00a0mm\/yr. The BLF undergoes an oblique motion with a sinistral rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.5\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr and a vertical rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.2\u00a0mm\/yr. Vector analysis of the slip rates on the YYF and BLF indicates that the northern LCJF zone has accommodated a primarily left-lateral slip of ~3.5\u00a0+\u00a01.1\/\u22120.8\u00a0mm\/yr with an NNE-vergent reverse component of ~1.6\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr (Fig. 16).\nThe projected Sichuan-Tibetan railway crosses the Holocene YYF and BLF (Fig. 2). Thus, the seismic hazard on the railway might sustain from large earthquakes on these two faults should be taken into account. The distinct surface rupture of the YYF can be traced to be ~80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0km long. If this length is entirely ruptured in the next earthquake, the empirical relationships between quantitative parameters (surface rupture length, coseismic offset, and so on) and magnitude for a strike-slip earthquake (Cheng et al., 2020; Wells and Coppersmith, 1994) will yield a magnitude of Mw ~7.2\u20137.3 and a left-lateral coseismic offset of ~1.8\u20132.0\u00a0m for the YYF (Table 4\n). Because the BLF locates in the area of deep downcutting, it is hard to map the fault length. Thus, the empirical relationship is not applicable to the estimation of coseismic offset displacement of large earthquakes on the BLF. It is to note that the T0 age at the GDX site is ~0.66\u00a0ka, which is too young to include one more seismic cycle. The T1 age approximately doubles the T0 age, and the scarp height on T1 is roughly two times that on T0, suggesting that the BLF might have undergone two events since the formation of terrace T1. Thus, we suggest that the scarp height (~1.1\u20131.3\u00a0m) may be the vertical coseismic slip of one event for the BLF, and its left-lateral coseismic offset is ~2.0\u00a0m, equivalent to the earthquake of Mw ~7.3 (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994) (Table 4).\nThe evident surface ruptures suggest that the last events on the YYF and BLF are not too old. A recent trench at the Gang fan and radiocarbon dating showed that the last earthquake ruptured this YYF at ~1270\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0cal BP (Rongjun Zhou, 2020, personal communication). The T0 age at the GDX site shows that the last fault event on the BLF occurred after ~0.66\u00a0ka. The accurate age of the most recent event on the BLF needs future trenching work to determine. In addition, because the record of strong earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06) in this area has been complete since 1915\u00a0CE (Huang et al., 1994), there is no record of the last events on the YYF and BLF. But these two faults have the potential of earthquakes of Mw 7.2\u20137.3. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the seismic hazard on the northern LCJF.\n\n\n6.2\nTectonic implications of the LCJF zone\nAs mentioned above, several active faults are distributed within the Qiangtang-Chuandian block. The NW-striking Litang fault is a dominantly left-lateral strike-slip fault with a late Quaternary left-slip rate of ~1\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr (Chevalier et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2005), and the NE-trending Batang fault within the block undergoes a dextral rate of ~2.0\u20132.7\u00a0mm\/yr in late Quaternary (Zhou et al., 2005) (Fig. 1). Another NE-striking Lijiang fault undertakes a sinistral motion with a slip rate of ~3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0mm\/yr in the Holocene (Fig. 1) (Xu et al., 2003). The Jiali fault as the southern boundary of the block has a dextral rate of ~3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr via geodetic analysis of Zhang et al. (2021). Our results reflect that the northern LCJF is also primarily sinistral and has accommodated a strike-slip rate of ~3.5\u00a0+\u00a01.1\/\u22120.8\u00a0mm\/yr and a vertical rate of ~1.6\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr in the late Quaternary, comparable to the Litang fault and other major faults in the Qiangtang-Chuandian block. Therefore, the LCJF zone should take an important role in accommodating the eastward motion of eastern Tibet. However, the main LCJF does not reveal a clear fault trace on the satellite imagery. We propose that the following two reasons might account for its faint fault trace. (1) The LCJF runs along the upper Lancangjiang River, where it is characterized by a high elevation of over 4000\u00a0m and high relief. Extensive alluvium, glaciation, and slope processes may erode or cover the fault trace. (2) The most recent surface-rupturing earthquake on the LCJF occurred so long ago that the subsequent surface processes and good vegetation could subdue and obscure the surface ruptures.\nAs described above, the deformation of eastern Tibet does not focus on the block boundary faults. A series of intra-block faults, such as the LCJF, Litang, Batang, and Lijiang faults, have absorbed an essential portion of regional tectonic deformations. Neither the rigid block model nor the continuous model is applicable to the deformation mechanism of eastern Tibet. Thatcher (2007) proposed a sub-block model in which the distinction between these two models becomes obscure with the decrease of block size. Subsequent sub-block models and geodetic data have been constructed to resolve slip rates of major faults within the blocks of the Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Loveless and Meade, 2011; Ren et al., 2013). The role of the intra-block faults such as the LCJF can be illustrated in these models. Thus, the deformation mechanism of eastern Tibet probably conforms to the sub-block model.\nAn interesting finding is that the YYF displaced several bedrock units in the geological map (Fig. 2). At Langda and Kongxie Villages in the eastern YYF, the east boundary of Jurassic strata was sinistrally offset by ~11\u00a0km. Around Yangda Village, the NW-striking Paleogene strata were probably left-laterally displaced by ~10\u00a0km (Fig. 2). Our results show that the YYF has a late Quaternary left-lateral slip rate of ~2.2\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.5\u00a0mm\/yr. If we assume that the slip rate on the YYF keeps constant over time, then the ~10\u201311\u00a0km displacement suggests that the YYF formed at ~5.9\u20133.9\u00a0Ma, which may represent the initiation age of the LCJF.\nIn fact, several tectonic events occurred during this period. The Red River shear zone as the southern boundary of the Qiangtang-Chuandian block underwent a sinistral ductile shear at ~36\u201317\u00a0Ma (et al., Leloup et al., 1995) and was transformed into a dextral motion in late Miocene (~5\u00a0Ma) (Leloup et al., 1993; Schoenbohm et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016). The modern pattern of strike-slip and normal faults has initiated during ~8\u20134\u00a0Ma and has accommodated clockwise rotation of crustal fragments around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis (King et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2021). Exhumation history suggests that the onset of motion along the Litang fault occurred during ~7\u20135\u00a0Ma (Zhang et al., 2015). Most geochronological studies reveal that the Xianshuihe fault has been active since at least 12\u201310\u00a0Ma (e.g., Li and Zhang, 2013; Roger et al., 1995; Wang and Burchfiel, 2000) and propagated southward toward the Xiaojiang fault at ~5\u00a0Ma (Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2008). The superposition of these events suggests that significant regional tectonic changes occurred in eastern Tibet from mid-Miocene to late Miocene, associated with the establishment of the present-day strain pattern and the onset of crustal thickening. Therefore, the initiation of the LCJF is probably associated with the significant regional tectonic changes in eastern Tibet.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nBased on the interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery, field observations and AMT exploration, we first map the detailed trace of the northern LCJF zone. We also use high-precise topographic surveys and multiple numerical dating of displaced landforms to constrain the fault slip rates in the late Quaternary. The study has led to the following conclusions.\n\n(1)\nThe northern LCJF zone consists of two branches: the NWW-trending YYF and NNW-striking BLF, which merged eastwards onto the main LCJF.\n\n\n(2)\nThe YYF undergoes a dominantly left-lateral motion and has a sinistral slip rate of ~2.2\u00a0+\u00a00.6\/\u22120.5\u00a0mm\/yr and a minor vertical rate of ~0.1\u00a0mm\/yr. The BLF undergoes an oblique motion with a left-lateral rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.5\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr and a northeast-vergent reverse rate of ~1.2\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.2\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n(3)\nThe northern LCJF zone may accommodate a primarily left-lateral slip of ~3.5\u00a0+\u00a01.1\/\u22120.8\u00a0mm\/yr with an NNE-vergent reverse component of ~1.6\u00a0+\u00a00.4\/\u22120.3\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n(4)\nThe YYF and BLF across the Sichuan-Tibet Railway have a seismic potential of Mw ~7.2\u20137.3 that will produce ~1.8\u20132.0\u00a0m sinistral slip on the YYF, and\u00a0~\u00a02.0\u00a0m horizontal and\u00a0~\u00a01.1\u20131.3\u00a0m reverse slips on the BLF.\n\n\n(5)\nThe LCJF has played an important role in strain partitioning of eastern Tibet. The formation of the LCJF took place at ~5.9\u20133.9\u00a0Ma and is related to the significant regional tectonic changes in east Tibet during the late Miocene\n\n\n\n\n\nData and resources\nThe earthquake catalog from the China Earthquake Networks Center is available at https:\/\/news.ceic.ac.cn\/index.html?time=1626007765 (last accessed July 2021).

DAS records acoustic waves, measuring the variations of Rayleigh backscattering of a laser pulse due to an axial strain of the fiber subjected to elastic vibrations (Fern\u00e1ndez-Ruiz et al., 2020; Soga and Luo, 2018).\nThe methodology showed high potential in different applications. The most common application is probably for deep seismic explorations through Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP) (Binder et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021a; Titov et al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2017).\nSeismic passive monitoring at the ground surface is a DAS application with an increasing range of usages in terms of operational conditions and scales. For example, DAS is applied in glaciated terrains to record microseismicity (Walter et al., 2020), as well as for seismological surveys when exploiting the measurements from underwater \u201cdark fibers\u201d, even if fiber optics exhibit higher sensitivity to S-waves than P-waves (Cheng et al., 2021; Lior et al., 2021). Other applications include the passive monitoring of volcanic earthquakes to infer the subsurface geological structures (Nishimura et al., 2021). In addition, passive acoustic acquisitions by means of fiber optics are effectively utilized for near-surface characterization of shear-wave velocity distributions (Dou et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021b; Yuan et al., 2020).\nAn issue while using DAS for seismological surveys lies in the impossibility to retrieve the absolute ground displacement as inertial seismometers. The transfer function between ground vibration and fiber optic strain needs to be calibrated, as presented, e.g., by Lindsey et al. (2020). On the contrary, common applied geophysical surveys do not require the knowledge of the absolute ground displacement. This characteristic is in common with traditional geophones used for engineering geology characterizations, which record relative ground vibrations as voltage amplitudes.\nThe present work focuses on a pilot test in the context of a near-surface geophysical survey for a civil engineering application. We explore the possibility of using DAS for assessing ground elastic parameters in a construction site and we compare the results against traditional geophones receivers to assess the capabilities and the limitations of the DAS technology. The investigated construction site is characterized by an artificially stabilized ground.\nGround stabilization is an engineering application (Firoozi et al., 2017) that faces an increasing demand for exploiting areas with poor bearing capacity. Generally, it results in large financial savings compared to alternative methods. In many cases, ground stabilization is the only practical and economically viable possibility. Ground stabilization is very attractive also from a sustainability perspective regarding natural resources: firstly, it is possible to utilize local material that would otherwise become a landfill problem, and, secondly, it saves valuable raw materials in the form of natural gravel or crushed rock. Utilizing local materials also reduces the need for transport, thus, in turn, it contributes to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. In the case of surface stabilization, a binder is milled into a layer of ground material (usually the shallower decimeters). Once the binder is hardened, quality control is required and, in this respect, seismic measurements can be used as non-invasive and non-destructive testing (Donohue and Long, 2008; Lin et al., 2017).\nClearly, the applicability of the proposed methodology can be extended to monitor, for example, the long-term performances of roads and pavements (Wang et al., 2013). In these cases, the durability assessment should not be limited to what can be inferred from the surface \u2013 e.g., by means of the falling weight deflectometer (Coni et al., 2018; Coni et al., 2021) or core drilling (Miskiewicz et al., 2018) \u2013 but it should also include information deduced from inside the structure and via sensors located at exactly the same positions during the long-time monitoring (Kara De Maeijer et al., 2019).\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nIn the present research, the geophysical survey has been performed on top of a slab of stabilized ground, on an active construction site. We acquired acoustic data simultaneously by employing fiber optics and geophones as seismic receivers. The data acquisition has been extended outside the ground-stabilized area with the aim of having also reference measurements on the natural ground.\n\n2.1\nExperimental site\nA construction site has been selected for conducting seismic surveys both via DAS and traditional geophones acquisitions. The experimental site is in the municipality of Lund (Sweden), where the European Spallation Source (ESS) facility was under construction (Fig. 1\n). We focused the experimental test on an area where a slab of stabilized quaternary deposit was constructed through the mixing of natural material and lime cement. The stabilization procedure consists of alternating layers of natural material \u2013 excavated from adjacent areas \u2013 and lime cement. The improved mechanical properties are supposed to be obtained through mechanical compaction and artificially increased moisture content, necessary for facilitating the chemical reactions of the binder.\nThe natural material consists of a clayey-silty till deposit on top of a metamorphic crystalline bedrock. The Quaternary sediment is structured in layers with variable granulometric size distributions, where sand or silt-clay could be predominant. The depth to bedrock is around 10\u00a0m from the topographic surface and presents a top layer of weathered rock with a thickness of about 1.5\u00a0m. The geological information is collected from geotechnical drilling placed about 100\u00a0m south of the site and the topographic elevation at the drilling location is about 1\u00a0m higher than the investigated area.\nThe stabilized material covers an area of approximately 30\u00a0m by 20\u00a0m (Fig. 1) and is characterized by a thickness of about 1\u20131.5\u00a0m. The stabilized slab is covered by an artificial layer of about 0.5\u00a0m composed of nearby natural glacial sediments.\nA geophysical profile of 90\u00a0m has been designed with the aim of investigating both the stabilized and the natural ground (Fig. 2\n). Along the profile, a 30\u00a0cm deep trench has been excavated to install the fiber optic cable within the ground (Fig. 3\n). This procedure is essential to ensure a good coupling between the cable and the surrounding material and is crucial for the transmission of acoustic energy from the ground to the cable. The fiber optic cable was placed in the ditch on a 2\u20133\u00a0cm bed of medium grain sand to avoid damage to the fiber. Damages might happen during the filling operation if the cable is in contact with large cobbles that might be present in the glacial material. The trench has been backfilled with an analogous thin layer of sand and the material previously excavated. The backfilled ditch has been compacted by the wheels of a heavy machine.\nThe geophones were placed on top of the installed fiber optic cable and they resulted to be precisely collocated as it is clear from the differential GNSS coordinates acquired along the fiber optic cable and at the geophone locations (Fig. 4A). By checking the elevation of the sensors (Fig. 4B), the position of the cable in the ground is about 0.30\u00a0m from the surface, across the entire profile. In addition, the higher elevation of the artificial ground compared to the natural condition is evident.\n\n\n2.2\nDAS system\nDAS is a technology that enables real-time measurements of strain and acoustic vibrations along the entire length of a fiber optic cable. The instrument utilized in the experiment is the Carina Sensing System technology (Silixa ltd), which includes an iDAS v3 interrogator and an engineered (\u201cconstellation\u201d) fiber.\nThe iDAS is a time domain, single-pulse, phase-based DAS instrument. It works by emitting a pulse of laser light into the optical fiber. As the pulse of light travels down the optical path, interacts within the fiber material resulting in backscattered light reflections. Variations in the amount of backscattered energy are determined by strain events within the fiber, which, in turn, are caused by localized acoustic energy (Lindsey et al., 2020). The time synchronization of the laser pulse allows the backscatter event to be accurately mapped to a fiber distance. The result is the continuous acoustic sampling along the entire length of the optical fiber with a frequency range from a few mHz to over 100\u00a0kHz.\nThe particular type of fiber (\u201cconstellation\u201d) applied in the present work is developed by Silixa ltd in the attempt to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Engineered bright scatters are implemented along the fiber to enhance the amount of reflected light without introducing significant excess loss in the forward propagating scattered light.\nThe Carina Sensing System technology was selected for the experiment since the near-surface engineering application needed high spatial resolution to resolve the shallower layers of the ground, which is the main goal of the survey. The other possibly available technical solutions would have not provided the same SNR at such a short spatial resolution.\n\n\n2.3\nTraditional geophone-receivers' system\nThe traditional geophone-receivers' system consists of a Summit X One seismograph (DMT Group) with a maximum number of 98 4.5\u00a0Hz-geophones. Half of the receivers measure the vertical component (GEO-V), whereas the remaining sensors record the horizontal component aligned with the profile direction (GEO-H). The vertical and horizontal geophones are located as close as possible in order to obtain 2-component soundings.\n\n\n2.4\nSurvey\nThe survey was performed on the 4th of September 2019. The source of active acoustic waves consisted of an accelerated weight drop (ESS100 Turbo) applied vertically on a metallic plate. This kind of source was necessary to transmit enough energy into the ground and limit the detrimental effects of environmental noise. Coherent noise sources mainly consisted of nearby active construction activities and of heavy vehicular traffic along Highway E22 (visible in the northwest corner of Fig. 1).\nAlong the investigated profile, we acquired three datasets by using three geophone layouts; each of them characterized by different locations and spacing intervals of the receivers. Contextually, the performed DAS acquisition always involved the entire profile with fixed spatial parameters. Table 1\n summarizes the parameters of the acquisition for both acoustic techniques (geophones and DAS).\nLayout 1 and Layout 2 are characterized by 2\u00a0m inter-geophone spacing for a total length of 88\u00a0m (45 2-component receiver stations were deployed); this length was enough to cover both the portion of stabilized ground and the area of natural ground (Fig. 2). Layout 2 is analogue to Layout 1; the only difference is that Layout 2 is shifted by 1\u00a0m forward, along the profile. This provides the possibility to combine the two layouts and eventually obtain a profile with a 1\u00a0m resolution. The integration of Layout 1 and 2 has been done via stacking the seismograms with the same source location, after careful processing and adjustments of zero time. For comparison, also the fiber optic data have been stacked.\nLayout 3 has a geophone spacing of 0.5\u00a0m for a profile length of 24\u00a0m (49 two-component receiver stations) and it is entirely located on the slab of stabilized material.\nThe DAS surveys are characterized by a characteristic Gauge length, which is the length of the fiber used to calculate the difference in the phase of the backscattered light. The recorded signal is thus averaged along a stretch of the fiber that is centered around the receiver position (Hartog, 2017). The spatial resolution is directly proportional to the Gauge length (Titov et al., 2021; Alfataierge et al., 2020) and, in the specific case under investigation, it equals 2\u00a0m.\n\n\n2.5\nData processing and inversion\nFollowing a quite standard procedure for the extraction of the dispersion curve from the seismic data recorded either with the geophone or with the fiber optics sensors (e.g.: Lai et al., 2002; Socco et al., 2010), the dependence of the Rayleigh wave velocities on the frequency can be deduced via a 2D Fourier transform of the collected seismograms. The result of the Fourier mapping between the time-distance space into the frequency-wavenumber space is usually called FK spectrum. The approach based on these integral transformations ensures the retrieval of more robust information; however, in the attempt of capturing the lateral velocity variations, alternative approaches have been recently developed (e.g.: Vignoli et al., 2011; Bergamo et al., 2012; Vignoli et al., 2016). In our specific test, as we assumed no significant lateral changes along the acquisition lines, after splitting the profile in stabilized and natural ground (Fig. 2), we made full use of the most common technique. Hence, the dispersion curves have been extracted via a simple picking, frequency-by-frequency, of the maxima of the FK spectrum. Dispersion curves describe the dependence of the surface wave (group and\/or phase) velocities on the frequencies (and, in turn, on the investigated depth); so, they can be inverted by using 1-D forward modelling algorithms (Park et al., 1999) to infer the shear-wave velocity profile beneath the acquisition location (in principle, phase velocities depend also on the compressional velocity and density, but, in the vast majority of the practical cases, that minor dependence is seldom exploited \u2013 see i.e. Xia et al., 1999).\nLike many other inversion problems, also retrieving the shear-wave velocity profile is an ill-posed problem and the associated ambiguity is usually tackled by including a regularization term in the inversion process. Basically, the regularization term formalizes the prior information \u2013 different from the one provided by the collected data \u2013 about the physical system under investigation. In this way, through the proper choice of the regularization term, it is possible to select \u2013 among all the possible solutions compatible with the data \u2013 the unique and stable model that is also consistent with our expectations (described by the regularization). Thus, the regularization term plays a crucial role in the selection of the final result (in our specific case, the shear-wave velocity profile).\nDespite its importance, usually, invocating a \u2013 perhaps, misinterpreted \u2013 Occam's Razor principle (Popper, 2005), the regularization term is chosen in order to favor smooth solutions (Zhdanov, 2002).\nHowever, this choice can be often in contradiction with the actual nature of the subsurface, in which, for example, the presence of sharp boundaries can be possibly well-known; in these cases, the use of smooth regularizations would lead to incorrect results (even if perfectly compatible with the measurements).\nIn the present research, since we knew that, by construction, the subsurface consists of blocky targets and abrupt changes in the physical properties, we coherently adopt a tunable regularization term based on the minimum gradient support stabilizer (Zhdanov et al., 2006; Vignoli et al., 2015). The main characteristic of the adopted stabilizer lies in the capability of providing solutions (equally compatible with the measurements) with a tunable level of sparsity (Vignoli et al., 2021). The adopted tunable stabilizer, s(\u03b2), has the following expression:\n\n(1)\n\ns\n\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n\n\nL\n\n\u0394\n\u03b2\n\n\n2\n\n\/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\u0394\n\u03b2\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\nwhere: L is a discrete approximation of the spatial derivative, \u0394\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03b2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2\n0) is the difference between the shear-wave velocity \u03b2 and the reference model \u03b2\n0, while \u03b5 is the parameter used to tune the desired sparsity level of the solution and that should be selected accordingly to the scale and the characteristics of the target features to be reconstructed (Vignoli et al., 2021). In particular, the value of the tuning parameter \u03b5 is connected to the minimum velocity variation to be considered significant for the studied problem.\nIn the present examples, the subsoil has been parameterized with 1000 layers with a fixed thickness of 0.05\u00a0m; this is to avoid any possible effect of the parameterization on the final result and to make the regularization term act as the unique inversion stabilizer. Hence, by following the prescriptions in Vignoli et al. (2021), the tuning parameter has been chosen equal to \u03b5 = 0.6 (for all the inverted datasets); this specific value, together with the used discretization, promotes the retrieval of velocity models characterized by (sharp) changes larger than a few tens of meters per seconds over a 1\u00a0m depth interval.\nConcerning the choice for the reference model, \u03b2\n0, it has been selected homogeneous and, so, characterized by a unique velocity equal to 400\u00a0m\/s. This specific value for the reference model (that, for consistency, is also the starting model) could be easily inferred by the dispersion curves at low frequencies. In any case, it can be easily shown (Vignoli et al., 2021; Vignoli et al., 2012) that this regularization strategy is quite robust with respect to different choices of the starting\/reference model (obviously above the Depth Of Investigation (DOI), i.e., the depth where the sensitivity of the data to the inversion model parameters drops significantly).\nIn the original work by Vignoli et al. (2021), it is demonstrated how different values of the tuning parameters can be used to explore the model space and how the best value range is generally chosen based on the scale of the application (from crustal studies to near-surface investigations). However, the goal of the present research is to assess the performances of DAS data with respect to the standard geophones for geotechnical characterizations (in particular, in presence of artificial soil stabilization). Thus, an in-depth study of the impacts of the tuning parameters choices would be out of the scope of the present paper; for that, we invite the readers to refer to Vignoli et al. (2021), and, possibly, also to its recent extension to the two-dimensional case discussed in Guillemoteau et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\nDAS data are always acquired along the entire length of the buried fiber optic cable, but, for sake of comparison, we selected the samples across the same transect as for the geophone layout for every single shot.\n\nFig. 5\n illustrates an example of seismograms, unfiltered and trace-normalized, for the Layout 1 configuration. DAS data has a higher spatial and temporal resolution (see Table 1).\nThe seismograms show high similarity, and the same seismic events can be recognized. In all the three acquisitions, it is particularly visible the transition zone between the topographically higher stabilized ground (from 0 to 38\u00a0m) and the natural ground (from 42 to 88\u00a0m). It is evident that the seismogram of the DAS acquisition (FIBER) is more similar to the horizontal in-line component of the geophones (GEO-H). DAS does not discriminate between the different spatial components of the ground movements and its sensitivity is a function of the angle of incidence of acoustic waves (Wu et al., 2017): the fiber optic is more sensitive to compressional (P) waves with low-degrees of incident angle (waves propagating in the same direction of the cable), whereas it is essentially blind to events that propagate perpendicular to the fiber optics. The strongest DAS response to shear (S) waves occurs when the incident angle is around 45 degrees and damps down to no recorded signal for higher and lower incident angles.\nDespite a general likeness between fiber optics and geophones acquisitions, a relevant aspect to be mentioned is the combined effect of spatial resolution (Gauge length) and spatial sampling of DAS surveys. We acquired a seismic trace every 0.255\u00a0m along the fiber with a Gauge length of 2\u00a0m (Table 1). The outcome of these parameters is a localized \u201cstepwise\u201d appearance of the seismic events in the DAS data, as it is particularly evident in Fig. 6\n, which shows the seismograms of Layout 3. The horizontal geophones (left plot) have a punctual resolution and a spatial sampling of 0.5\u00a0m. Even if the spatial frequency is lower than for the fiber optic data, the seismogram looks smoother, and the seismic events have a more linear appearance. Instead, the DAS seismogram (right plot in Fig. 6) shows a \u201cstepwise\u201d behavior that is more pronounced in some portions of the profile, reaching a maximum of 6 adjacent traces (between 8 and 9\u00a0m) displaying a similar pattern, especially at traveltimes around 0.1\u00a0s. The same pattern is present in all the acquisitions independently from the location of the source.\nThe integration along the Gauge length acts as a moving average window (Dean et al., 2017). Along the 2\u00a0m resolution segment, some points can record a stronger signal that is dominant and commonly present in a few traces. The stronger signal at some points can be caused by a local more effective coupling of the cable with the surrounding material. This localized and more intense stretching of the optic fiber may mask the weaker signals from the other portions of the 2\u00a0m segment (Gauge length). The cable construction (e.g., the distribution of scattering points along the glass fiber) can also play a role in defining how the fiber optic responds to external vibrations, enhancing the signal from specific portions of the Gauge length.\nThe acquired seismic data have been analyzed for the seismic refraction method (Fig. 7\n). A clear refracted event is recognizable in the vertical geophones (GEO-V) dataset, whereas it is very weak in the seismogram collected by horizontal in-line geophones (GEO-H), such that it is hardly detectable within 30\u00a0m from the source. The seismogram from the DAS acquisition does not show any refracted event, not even characterized by a weak signal. In Fig. 7, the picked refracted event from the GEO-V seismogram (blue dashed line) is superimposed on the other two datasets. From the bottom panel in Fig. 7, it is evident that no significant signal is present at those time-locations in the fiber optic data, and that DAS is recording merely high-frequency noise. This is consistent with the fact that refracted waves have a high angle of incidence at the surface, due to the slower shallower layer. As analyzed by Wu et al. (2017), DAS is mainly sensitive to P-waves propagating along the same direction of the cable; consistently, for higher incident angles, the signal progressively fades, resulting in an unobservable refraction event.\n\nFigs. 8 and 9\n\n show the seismograms (left column) of Layout 2 for the geophones and fiber optics acquisitions; the profile has been subdivided into the portions associated with the stabilized and natural ground, respectively. Not surprisingly (improving the geotechnical characteristics is the ultimate goal of ground stabilization), the portion of untreated ground is characterized by slower velocities of the seismic events. The same figures display the spectral content of each trace (FX), in the right column. Also in this case, it is evident, especially considering the FX spectra, that the signal recorded by the DAS system shows a higher similarity with the horizontal geophones in both ground conditions.\nThe DAS seismogram of the natural ground (Fig. 9) reveals less pronounced \u201cstepwise\u201d features (see Fig. 6) compared to the portion of stabilized ground (Fig. 8), despite the identical fiber installation. This can be due to the different spectral content of the natural ground, characterized by lower frequencies, which are less affected by the Gauge length. Fig. 10\n displays, for Layout 3, the same high similarity between the fiber optics and the horizontal geophones \u2013 in this specific case, characterized, by a higher spatial sampling (0.5\u00a0m).\nWith the aim of thoroughly analyzing the spectral content of the recorded acoustic signal, a two-dimensional Fourier transform (FK) has been applied to the seismograms (Figs. 11\u201313\n\n\n). The similarity between the acoustic sensors is here quantified by analyzing the discrepancies of the energy distribution in the FK spectra normalized, frequency-by-frequency, for the corresponding amplitude maximum (columns B and C).\nThe most energetic dispersive event \u2013 related to surface waves propagation \u2013 is essentially identical for geophones and DAS receivers (columns B in Figs. 11 and 12), for which the larger spatial sampling of the geophones (2\u00a0m) results in a narrower wavenumber range. The most evident differences are between fiber optic sensors and vertical geophones, and they are related to seismic events with high frequencies and to higher modes of propagation of the surface waves. This is particularly clear by studying the frequency-by-frequency Root Mean Square (RMS) error (columns C in Figs. 11 and 12).\nThe higher lateral sampling rate of Layout 3 of the geophones acquisition allows analyzing shorter wavelengths (Fig. 13A). Despite the higher spatial sampling rate of the DAS data \u2013 almost twice the geophone's one \u2013 the DAS recorded signal shows a spectrum limited to lower wavenumber values (Fig. 13B). The energy maxima of the lower mode of propagation of surface waves (possibly the fundamental mode) are concentrated in the area of the FK spectrum with upper limits of 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0m\u22121 and around 60\u00a0Hz. This means that DAS does not sense wavelengths shorter than about 1.25\u20131.5\u00a0m, even if, theoretically, the spatial sampling allows the system to record wavelengths larger than 0.51\u00a0m. The shorter wavelengths could not be represented due to the resolution driven by the 2\u00a0m Gauge length, which acts as a low-pass filter.\nThe maximum amplitude of the FK spectra has been picked at each frequency for the three different recording settings (vertical and horizontal geophones, and DAS). The picking results are plotted together for sake of comparison in Fig. 14\n. The slower and most energetic mode of propagation of surface waves (from here below assumed to be \u2013 and correspondingly named \u2013 \u201cfundamental mode\u201d) coincides between the different receiver settings, whereas the higher modes of propagation (characterized by higher frequencies and lower amplitude) are only partially consistent. The different records obtained with the different sensors have comparable modes of propagation within a small variance due to inevitable environmental noise. The higher resolution of the geophones in Layout 3 (Fig. 14C) allows identifying the fundamental mode of surface waves propagation across a larger range. If DAS is compared with geophones of Layouts 1 and 2 (Fig. 14A and B), the fundamental modes are essentially superimposed. Only for the faster stabilized ground (Fig. 14A), the fiber optics (red dots) are capable to record higher frequencies for the fundamental mode: almost 60\u00a0Hz compared to approximately 50\u00a0Hz of the spectra extracted from the geophones data.\nThe goal of ground stabilization procedures is to enhance the mechanical properties of the original natural sediments. The shear modulus is a relevant parameter for the geotechnical characterization of the ground related to infrastructure building and depends on the shear wave velocities (Vs). For this reason, the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves has been extracted and inverted to obtain a vertical one-dimensional profile of Vs (Fig. 15\n).\n\nFig. 15A shows the results of the inversion of the dispersion curve data extracted from some of the maxima of the FK spectra in Fig. 14 (associated with different portions of stabilized and natural ground). The Vs profiles derived by the acquisition on the natural ground (dashed lines in Fig. 15A) are vertically shifted by 0.75\u00a0m to compensate for the mean elevation difference with respect to the artificial ground (Fig. 4B). Fig. 15B displays the experimental and the calculated dispersion curves of the fundamental mode for each inverted layout: i) the gray error-bars show the phase-velocities (VR) extracted by the data, together with the associated uncertainty (estimated via several repetitions with the same source location); whereas the colored lines are the VR curves calculated from the unidimensional Vs distribution inferred via the inversion.\nFrom Fig. 15A, it clearly appears as the reconstructed Vs distributions are consistent between the different acquisition techniques, especially, at shallow, where a low-velocity layer (Vs\u00a0<\u00a0250\u00a0m\/s) is identified between 0 and 3\u00a0m below the topographic surface. The almost perfect matching between the inversion results, associated:\n\ni)\non one hand, for the stabilized portion, with the two different geophone Layouts (Layout 3 and the combined Layout 1\u00a0+\u00a02); and\n\n\nii)\non the other hand, for the natural ground, with the DAS and the combined geophones Layout 1\u00a0+\u00a02 data,\n\nare particularly impressive and demonstrate the extreme reliability of the surface wave for the reconstruction of even relatively complex shear-modulus profiles. The only significant mismatch occurs, at depth (> 4\u00a0m) for the stabilized ground and between the fiber (solid red line) and the geophone (solid blue and cyan lines) results; this discrepancy is caused by the higher phase velocities recorded by the DAS at a lower frequency. The higher velocity recorded by the DAS in the low-frequency range (< 25\u00a0Hz) is visible comparing the 1st, 2nd, and the 4th panels in Fig. 15B (blue, cyan, and red solid lines). This higher phase velocity recorded by the fibers is a consequence of the broader amplitude peak of the FK spectrum in that frequency range with respect to the corresponding vertical geophone (in this respect, compare the top and bottom panels of Fig. 13A). This is consistent with the fact that the measurements recorded by the fiber optics are a combination (i.e., a weighted average) of the vertical and horizontal components of the signal propagating from the source (e.g., Kennett, 2022).\nConsidering again Fig. 15A, and \u2013 in particular, comparing the solid (corresponding to the measurements over the stabilized ground) and the dashed (associated with the natural ground) lines \u2013 within the shallowest 4\u00a0m, it is not surprising that the ground stabilization procedure increased the Vs values by approximately 50\u2013100\u00a0m\/s (hence by around 60% of the original velocity) with respect to the natural ground. More specifically, a clear effect of the stabilization is evident in the shallower 2\u00a0m, whereas, from 2 to 4\u00a0m, the increased velocity is a consequence of the repeated mechanical compaction operated during the construction of the artificial ground.\nThe bedrock shows Vs values larger than 400\u00a0m\/s and it can be identified at a depth of around 8\u00a0m. The differences between the inferred depths for the natural and stabilized ground are compatible with the typical spatial variability of the geology in the area, especially if we consider a weathered rock layer of 1.5\u00a0m thickness, as confirmed by nearby drilling.\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThe present work is a feasibility study on the application of fiber optics as acoustic sensors for civil engineering investigations in connection with ground stabilization, focusing on the comparison with standard acoustic sensors (geophones).\nThe results clearly show that the signal from the fiber optics, despite the inevitable differences with respect to the different components collected via the standard geophones, can be a valid alternative to standard seismic receivers for specific applications. As a general conclusion, DAS is a methodology that can prove to be a powerful tool for near-surface geophysical studies in environmental and civil engineering applications.\nThe signal from the DAS system is almost equivalent to standard seismic receivers. As it was expected, fiber optics display a higher similarity with the horizontal in-line component of the geophones, as they record the longitudinal stretching of the fiber. On the other hand, DAS is less sensitive to acoustic waves propagating perpendicularly to fiber cable. For this reason, a refracted event was not detectable via DAS despite the good coupling between the fiber optics cable and the ground. In turn, this highlights that DAS might not be the best tool for geotechnical characterization via refraction seismics.\nThe frequency content of the DAS system is strongly related to the resolution of the technique, which depends on the Gauge length (2\u00a0m in the present work). Such resolution makes DAS less sensitive to smaller wavelengths compared to short-spacing geophones. It must be mentioned that seismic surveys are rarely conducted with an intra-geophone spacing of less than 1\u00a0m. The uncertainty of the relative location of the receivers, especially on a rugged topographic surface, usually makes traditional seismic measurements impractical with a spatial resolution smaller than 0.5\u00a0m. On the other hand, the exact location of the receiver position along the fiber optics is a great advantage of the DAS acquisitions.\nThe vertical profiles of inverted shear-wave velocities from the DAS dataset are comparable with the same profiles obtained from traditional acquisitions through geophones. A similar improvement of the mechanical properties is identified with both technologies, even if the shear-wave velocities increase by about 50\u2013100\u00a0m\/s in the area of the stabilized ground.\nThe specifications of the DAS instrument applied in the project (spatial resolution of 2\u00a0m and spatial sampling interval of 0.255\u00a0m) are probably the minimum requirements for these types of engineering applications. Considering that DAS is a recent technological development, this limit might be overtaken in the future, paving the way for broader ranges of applications.\nThus, briefly, the novelties of the discussed approach and tests concern:\n\ni)\nThe effectiveness of geophysical methods (and, in particular, surface wave inversion) for the reconstruction of geotechnical parameters (when properly used; for example, with the use of the proper regularization);\n\n\nii)\nThe unavoidable differences between standard geophones and the new fiber sensors in terms of recorded seismic responses;\n\n\niii)\nThe fact that, despite the differences with respect to the geophones, DAS data can be considered, for specific applications, a valid alternative to more traditional techniques.\n\n\n\n\n","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"","119":""},"Creator":{"0":["Farmakis, Ioannis","DiFrancesco, Paul-Mark","Hutchinson, D.

Modern observations reveal that the \u03b418O in precipitation is an integrated tracer of the atmospheric processes of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and the westerlies, which dominate the climate of the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we summarize and compare 20 Holocene lacustrine authigenic carbonate \u03b418O records from lakes distributed across the Tibetan Plateau. After carefully considering the potential effects of temperature, evaporation, site elevation, meltwater supply, and moisture sources, we eliminate their influences on the isotopic composition of Tibetan lakes, and suggest that the long-term variations of the lacustrine \u03b418O records were dominated by the moisture sources. The \u03b418O values of the lake sediments in the central and western Tibetan Plateau increased since the early Holocene, which agrees with the trend of \u03b418O in speleothem records from the plateau, as well as with the variations of monsoon precipitation reconstructions for the region. Overall, this evidence indicates the substantial influence of the monsoon in the abovementioned regions. However, the \u03b418O records from lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau show a decreasing trend during the second half of the Holocene (after \u223c5\u00a0ka), highlighting the operation of a different hydrological process, with enhanced moisture availability, in the regions. It has been suggested that the increased contribution from westerlies-derived moisture in the non-monsoon season, with depleted \u03b418O (e.g., from melting snow or frozen soil in spring), is responsible for such variations. We propose that the interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies was the major control of the hydroclimatic variations on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene, which led to the dipolar pattern of moisture variation between the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and other parts of the plateau, on the multi-millennial timescales during the Holocene.\n               ","1":"\n                  The role of possible controlling factors in influencing the geomorphology of submarine canyons has been investigated using a database of 282 globally distributed modern examples collated from the literature and open-source worldwide bathymetry. Canyon geomorphology has been characterised quantitatively in terms of maximum and average canyon dimensions, canyon sinuosity, average canyon thalweg gradient, and maximum canyon sidewall steepness. An assessment is made of how geomorphological characteristics vary with respect to the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break, continental-margin type, terrestrial source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment, and latitude. Scaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, and correlations between these and attributes of the canyon physiographic settings, terrestrial catchments, and continental shelves and slopes, have been quantified.\n                  Key findings are as follows: (i) a number of scaling relationships describing canyon morphometry (e.g. scaling between maximum canyon dimensions, relationships of maximum canyon sidewall steepness with maximum canyon width and depth) can be recognised globally, suggesting their general predictive value; (ii) possible causal links are identified between hydrodynamic processes (e.g. upwelling, longshore- and along-slope currents) and canyon morphology; (iii) potential predictors of aspects of canyon geomorphology include whether a canyon is incised into the shelf or confined to the slope, the continental-margin type, the oceanographic environment, latitude, and shelf-break depth; (iv) similarity in the distributions of maximum width-to-maximum depth ratios across all settings suggests that the relative magnitudes of canyon-margin erosion and intra-canyon deposition do not vary greatly depending on setting or canyon size.\n                  The relationships between canyon geomorphology and environmental variables identified in this study may be incorporated into conceptual models describing canyon geomorphology and its relationship both to other elements of deep-water systems, and to its broader source-to-sink context. The results provide a framework for future experimental and numerical studies of canyon geomorphology.\n               ","2":"\n                  Biogenic sedimentary structures, or traces, on the modern seafloor (neoichnology) record organism behaviors in response to physico-chemical conditions; consequently, they, act as analogues to similar structures preserved in the sedimentary record. Neoichnological insights are fundamental to the broad fields of paleobiology, paleontology, and sedimentology. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding animal-sediment interactions in siliciclastic shallow-marine environments with the aim of helping workers link their observations of biogenic structures to trace-making organisms and to predict the environmental conditions under which those traces were produced. This knowledge base is useful for reconstructing paleo-ecosystems and evolutionary trends through Earth history, as well as for constructing integrated facies models that explain the nature and distribution of sedimentary strata.\n                  Annelids, bivalves, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, and sea anemones produce most marine bioturbation. These organisms respond in predictable ways to major physical and chemical stressors in their environment. Such stressors include sediment texture, substrate consistency, sedimentation rate, subaerial exposure, temperature, turbidity, oxygenation, and water salinity. Invertebrates prefer to burrow in sand and firm mud, and generally avoid water saturated mud and coarse-grained sediment. Loosegrounds and softgrounds display the most diverse trace assemblages, compared to stiff, firm, and hard substrates. Low sedimentation rates result in high bioturbation intensity and diverse trace assemblages. Increasing sedimentation rate decreases the intensity of bioturbation. Subaerial exposure shifts faunal populations towards trophic generalists who produce simple structures. Highly turbid water causes deposit-feeding behaviors to predominate. Water salinity controls endobenthos and their burrowing assemblages. Normal marine conditions have diverse ichnofauna, whereas brackish water settings display low diversity but sometimes high-density bioturbation. Hypersaline waters contain low diversity ichnofaunas. Low dissolved oxygen manifests in low abundances, diversities, and densities of trace assemblages. With increasing latitude, burrowing organisms shift to deeper water, burrowing by crustaceans decreases, polychaete-generated structures are more abundant, and the size of burrows increases. Despite the current knowledge base of invertebrate neoichnology in siliciclastic shallow marine environments, the link between physico-chemical environmental stressors and burrowing remain mostly qualitative.\n               ","3":"\n                  Both the kinematics and dynamics of topographic growth of the Tibetan Plateau remain debated, despite their significance for understanding the evolution of continental lithospheric geodynamics, climate, and biodiversity in Asia. Topographic swath profiles reveal the diversity of high-elevation, low-relief plateau surfaces or \u201crelict landscapes\u201d throughout the southeast Qiangtang, northeast Qiangtang, and Songpan-Garze-Yidun terranes in eastern Tibet, including the Zuogong, Markam, Litang, and Kangding plateaux from southwest to northeast. New geo-thermochronology data combined with morphotectonic analysis of the Qiangtang terrane underscore that the Lancangjiang thrust belt, separating the Zuogong and Markam plateaux, is a prominent tectonic and geomorphic boundary that limits high topography at mean elevations of >5000\u00a0m around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Inverse thermal-history modelling of thermochronological data reveals accelerated cooling at 40\u201335\u00a0Ma at rates of 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mm\/yr in the Zuogong plateau and contemporaneous slow cooling of 0.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0mm\/yr in the Markam and Weixi plateaux in eastern Tibet, which is interpreted as recording activity of the Lancangjiang and Markam fold-and-thrust belts. These data, together with coeval cooling signals in the central and southeast Qiangtang terrane, indicate widespread crustal shortening and thickening throughout the terrane that likely led to surface uplift to near-present-day elevations by the late Eocene. Very slow cooling at a rate of <0.5\u00a0\u00b0C\/Myr rules out significant tectonically-driven surface uplift and erosion of the Markam plateau since then. A second stage of rapid exhumation at ca. 20\u00a0Ma, at rates of 1.0\u20131.3\u00a0mm\/yr, in the Zuogong plateau in the hanging wall of the Lancangjiang thrust, sharply contrasts to exhumation rates of 0.02\u00a0mm\/yr for the Markam plateau in the footwall and suggests reactivation of the Lancangjiang thrust belt at that time. The transition to slow denudation after ca. 20\u00a0Ma for the Zuogong plateau in the southwest Qiangtang suggests tectonic and topographic stabilization of this low-relief surface at least 15\u201320 Myr later than the Markam plateau. In contrast, a compilation of existing low-temperature thermochronology data in the Songpan-Garze-Yidun terranes shows much older ages for stabilization of the low-relief surfaces in the Litang and Kangding plateaux by 80\u201360\u00a0Ma. We thus suggest that tectonic and topographic stabilization of plateau surfaces in eastern Tibet has occurred at 80\u201360\u00a0Ma, 40\u201335\u00a0Ma, and\u00a0~\u00a020\u00a0Ma in the Songpan-Garze-Yidun, northeast Qiangtang, and southwest Qiangtang, respectively. The southwestward piecemeal expansion of small plateaux suggests that the high-elevation, low-relief landscape of eastern Tibet has been constructed during distinct orogenic episodes prior to and during the early stages of India-Asia collision. A late stage of tectonic activity related to northward indentation of the Indian plate during the Neogene mostly remodeled the outer rims of the plateaux and the valleys that delineate transcurrent faults, while drainage expansion and integration triggered river incision in eastern Tibet.\n               ","4":"\n                  Rodrigues et al. (2022) have proposed a new classification for mixed turbidite-contourite depositional systems based on their notion that there is only one type of tubidite and that there is only one type of contourite in deep-marine systems. However, there are at least 36 turbidite types and 4 contourite types in the published literature. Furthermore, they have used the term \u201cbottom current\u201d to represent a single unique current, which flows along-slope. Nevertheless, there are 4 major types of bottom currents (thermohaline contour currents, tidal currents, baroclinic currents, and wind-driven currents). With the exception of contour currents, the other three currents do not and cannot flow along-slope. The problem here is that the authors have failed to provide a clear and precise definition of the terms \u201cturbidite\u201d, \u201ccontourite\u201d, and \u201cbottom current\u201d Consequently, their classification has added a new layer of confusion to an already muddled domain of turbidite-contourite research. Importantly, their review article suffers from failing to cite pioneering and seminal works on turbidites (e.g., Kuenen, 1957; Bouma, 1962; Bagnold, 1962,; Middleton, 1967; Sanders, 1965; among others) and on contourites (e.g., Hollister, 1967). In seeking clarity, the purpose of this discussion is to identify specific issues with 14 questions under the following topics: (1) the turbidite problem, (2) the contourite problem, (3) the bottom-current problem, and (4) the seismic geometry vs. process sedimentology problem. Hopefully, the authors would respond with necessary definitions, empirical data, and references.\n               ","5":"\n                  Lying to the south of the Dharwar Craton, the expansive granulite massif, known as the Granulite Terrane of South India, preserves protracted history of the earth from ca. 3400\u2013500\u00a0Ma. It has been divided into Northern and Southern Granulite Terranes, separated by the Moyar-Bhawani Shear Zone. Unlike the Archean Northern Granulite Terrane, the rocks of the Southern Granulite Terrane bear imprints of magmatism, sedimentation and metamorphism for over 2 billion years from Neoarchean to Cambrian. The Southern Granulite Terrane is subdivided into three geographic divisions, namely Nilgiri-Namakkal Block, Madurai Block and Trivandrum Block, separated from each other by the Palghat-Cauvery Shear Zone and Achankovil Shear Zone. The Nilgiri-Namakkal Block preserves ca. 2900\u20132550\u00a0Ma ensemble of mafic-ultramafic rocks, interpreted as the remnants of Archean oceanic crust formed in a suprasubduction zone. Several phases of felsic magmatism between ca. 2840\u20132500\u00a0Ma and vestigial records of ca. 2600\u20132530\u00a0Ma sedimentation and ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism are found in the Nilgiri-Namakkal and Madurai Blocks. These felsic rocks, showing distinct TTG-type chemistry, rarely record the late Archean ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism, but underwent extensive high-pressure metamorphism (>11\u00a0kbar) along 43\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C\/kbar geothermal gradients during early Siderian (2490\u20132440\u00a0Ma). The late Archean felsic magmatism and the superimposed early Siderian high-pressure metamorphism has been explained by \u2018peel-back\u2019 convergence mechanism that takes in account higher mantle temperature during this time. The Siderian crust of the Nilgiri-Namakkal, Madurai and possibly Trivandrum Blocks received extensive multi-phase sedimentation, presumably in a stable continental shelf, spanning from ca. 1800\u2013700\u00a0Ma, partially sourced from the Northern Granulite Terrane and Western Dharwar Craton. This together with the unbroken magmatic and metamorphic episodes across the Palghat-Cauvery Shear Zone do not support the view that Palghat-Cauvery Shear Zone represents a Neoproterozoic suture along which the \u2018Mozambique Ocean\u2019 was closed. The remarkable similarity of geological events across the Moyar-Bhawani Shear Zone supports that the Northern and Southern Granulite Terranes formed a coherent block at least from ca. 2600\u00a0Ma. The late Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1740\u20131620\u00a0Ma) subduction related granitoid magmatism signifies crustal growth during Columbia supercontinent formation. The (Northern + Southern) Granulite Terrane coherent block was extended (without opening of an ocean basin) and received magmatism ranging from alkaline\u2013carbonatite to A-type granitoids during ca. 850\u2013600\u00a0Ma, which is tentatively related to the breakdown of Rodinia. Subsequent Ediacaran-Cambrian high- to ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism and associated magmatism, preponderant throughout the Southern Granulite Terrane, marks the last phase of tectonothermal event in the region and is widely correlated to the amalgamation of Gondwana supercontinent.\n                  The geological history of the Northern and Southern Granulite Terranes shows striking resemblance with the Antongil-Masora-Bemarivo and Antananarivo-Ikalamavony\u2013Itremo domains of Madagascar, respectively. Formation of a unified Indo-Madagascar landmass since ca. 2600\u00a0Ma or earlier is consistent with the extant geological evidence. Precambrian rocks of Sri Lanka share the Ediacaran-Cambrian metamorphism with the Southern Granulite Terrane and the basements rocks of Madagascar. However, inadequate data from Sri Lanka does not allow us to infer if Sri Lanka was part of the coherent Indo-Madagascar landmass since late Archean.\n               ","6":"","7":"\n                  Over the past couple decades, the understanding of petrophysical parameters in bioturbated hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers has expanded greatly. Specifically, insights into how bioturbation impacts the distributions of porosity and permeability has occurred through both direct measurements (spot-permeameter, high-resolution imaging) and computer modelling of features such as bioturbation intensity and burrow architecture. Within this review paper, a detailed overview of the concepts associated with the application of ichnology to reservoir fluid flow from both a historical and modern perspective are completed. Following this, the nature of biogenic permeability and porosity is discussed and we inspect the ways in which burrows might influence those parameters. Focus is ultimately then applied to summarizing the most common methods used to quantify bioturbation within rock samples. The overview is then underpinned by a number of different case studies which highlight the variations of biogenic permeability encountered within a wide-ranging classification system, and we summarize those at the end.\n               ","8":"\n                  On-going trade wars combined with the increasing consumption and depletion of known resources will necessitate the search for new deposits in poorly explored or unexplored areas, such as the polar regions. Antarctica is particular among the world's continents in that it has no native population and state sovereignty; the continent has also been identified as potentially harboring extensive hydrocarbon and mineral resources. In order to protect the fragile environment of Antarctic, the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991) banned all mineral activities for a 50-year period, except for scientific purposes. The Protocol will be renewed in 2048, and discussion of possible future mining in the region has already begun. With the improvement of drilling and mining technology, the risk of future mining activity on the continent is increasing. Moreover, extensive mining operations in the Arctic demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of mining activities in harsh polar environments. The conservation of the fragile environment of Antarctic must be prioritized and some considerations of renewal of the Protocol on Environmental Protection are discussed in this paper.\n               ","9":"\n                  Ecosystem engineering deals with how one species affects another (or others) via modifying habitat conditions and resource availability. Through the application of this concept, many Earth scientists have assessed the roles of focal species in modulating landscape formation and dynamics. No species, however, lives or evolves in isolation; moreover, few species exist without any engineering effects on their ambient environment. Based on these basic premises, it appears unlikely that any landform on Earth (except, for example, hyperarid desert dunes, recent lava flows, and glacial grooves) exclusively represents the engineering impact of a single species. Thus, surface topography, to some degree, can generally be a combined expression of\u00a0\u2265\u00a0two species that mutually interact with each other through their own engineering activities. The purpose of the present research was to review, refine, and expand upon the original ecosystem engineering concept to make it more inclusive and comprehensive. Accordingly, a new concept has been proposed here, the windows of combined ecosystem engineering (WoCEE), to indicate the range within which the relative importance of engineering effects for\u00a0\u2265\u00a0two species changes along a gradient, as defined by various abiotic and biotic factors. In support of this novel idea, real-world examples are presented, including ecological succession in terrestrial and coastal dune ecosystems, crab\u2013plant interactions on tidal wetlands, pocket gopher\u2013plant relationships in the grasslands, and biological invasions by exotic mollusks and macrophytes. Notably, there are likely various other examples in nature, provided the spatiotemporal scales at which multiple species play their bioengineering roles correspond to those at which landforms are shaped. This framework represents an important step forward in the realization of true ecosystem engineering and will potentially serve as a unifying theme of biogeomorphology.\n               ","10":"\n                  Peatlands are important carbon sinks, therefore their degradation mainly due to lowering of the water table, has an adverse effect to the carbon cycle and largely burden the atmosphere. Annually, extensive areas of these peatlands are affected by wildfires, therefore large peatland areas have been degraded, directly or indirectly related to anthropogenic activities, largely contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the most pristine tropical peatlands worldwide occur primarily at the coastal lowlands of Southeast Asia. In terms of their geological features and evolution, these sites are generally understudied despite covering more than half of the global area of tropical peatlands. This review compiles geological data from 52 peatlands from insular and continental Southeast Asia, providing a comprehensive geological dataset for future research. The Southeast Asian peatlands are mostly ombrogenous and hence poorly supplied by nutrients. During the Last Glacial Period (ca. 115,000\u201311,000\u00a0years ago), extensive areas were exposed because of the lowering of the seawater level, which caused a consequent lowering of the groundwater table landwards; the forests were under severe threat, mainly due to dry conditions, thus resulting in the retreat of the forest boundaries inland. This was an unfavourable environment for peatland formation and hence, most of the Southeast Asian peatlands were formed right after that period. Almost 40% of the reviewed sites are located on Borneo Island, highlighting the importance of Bornean peatlands, where many peatlands are already deforested and drained and converted to plantations. Overall, the available geological data from the Southeast Asian peatlands is incomplete and non-comparable to each other because each study has a different focus. Details, such as the type of peat-forming plants, age of peat, peat thickness, substrate type and the pH value are not reported systematically in approximately 30% of the reviewed sites, while other important geological data, such as the ash yield and the carbon content of peat are only reported in 30% and 10% of the reviewed sites, respectively. Characterisation of peatlands using data imputation and principal component analysis (PCA) is based on three physical parameters (maximum ash yield, maximum thickness and oldest age), and includes the study of their relation in terms of climatic periods, peatland type, region and substrate. It is observed that peatlands which were developed in warming periods share similar physical parameters (such as accumulation rates, ash yield, peatland type, and environment of the substrates). With better data reporting on these parameters, the PCA analysis can provide a more accurate reflection of peatland characteristics and their relationships. The study aims to raise awareness on the importance and vulnerability of the Southeast Asian peatlands and to highlight their role in the global climate fluctuations.\n               ","11":"\n                  A review of the early Holocene paleoseismicity in areas covered by huge ice sheets in the interior of Fennoscandia and North America shows that observational data and numerical modelling are consistent with a Glacial Isostatic Adjustment response to ice removal from thick old lithosphere during the last deglaciation. We primarily relate this climate-earthquake relationship to the combined effects of the state of the lithosphere and upper asthenosphere, mainly temperature, rheology and stress, and the state and trend of the climate. The changing ice load modulates the viscoelastic Earth response and the effective stress in such a way that it may cause crustal earthquake ruptures and earthquakes by positive augmentation of pre-existing sources of stress, potentially reactivating old structural features, i.e., inheritance and rejuvenation. The review also introduces issues related to modelling methods and assumptions, such as using realistic ice loads in space and time and appropriate lateral and vertical models of structure, composition and physical properties of the crust and upper mantle. With such caveats in mind, the difference in postglacial tectonic response in North America and Fennoscandia is yet not satisfactorily understood. However, differences in stress augmentation, a greater and longer lasting ice load over a lower relief bedrock, and potential release of stress at greater depth may be specific to North America. Also, while Archean crust characterizes most of the Canadian Shield, almost all of the Fennoscandian paleoseismicity is found in Proterozoic terrains, between the Caledonides to the west and the Archean shield to the northeast. Moreover, the plate boundary configuration yields a variable intraplate ridge-push trend not yet properly accounted for in modelling. In Fennoscandia, there is a clear spatial relationship between rebound, earthquakes and old structures in the Lapland Fault Province and beyond. While the main seismic activity earlier was assumed to have occurred during ~11.5\u20138.2\u00a0ka, there is now increasing evidence also for mid- and late-Holocene ruptures and for fault segmentation instead of previously assumed whole-scarp ruptures, which yielded magnitude estimates up to M\u00a0~\u00a08.2. However, the rupture dates and magnitudes of most postglacial events in Fennoscandia are still uncertain, and even more so in North America.\n               ","12":"","13":"\n                  The origin and development of the major rivers in the eastern Tibetan Plateau have been a special focus of research because of the close links recognized between river formation, tectonic uplift, and climate change. In this article, we review a number of sedimentary provenance investigations aiming to constrain the drainage evolution of the main rivers draining eastern Tibet, including the Mekong, Red, Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. The Mekong River was formed no later than ~17\u00a0Ma, likely triggered by a period of enhanced East Asian summer monsoon precipitation during the middle Miocene. A single large paleo-Red River draining the southeastern Tibetan Plateau into the Song Hong - Yinggehai Basin had been proposed to explain the unusual drainage pattern. However, this is not compatible with the distinctive provenance signals in the southeastern Tibetan river sands compared with the Song Hong - Yinggehai Basin, indicating that there has been no large-scale paleo-Red River since the late Eocene. The Pearl River has formed during the late Oligocene, as there was a sharp provenance change in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. Moreover, rivers draining southeast coastal China (e.g., Min River) migrated westward at the same time. These clues highlight that paleo-rivers in southeastern China started to migrate inland during the Late Oligocene. In contrast, the formation timing of the Yangtze River is still under intensively debated, ranging from late Cretaceous to Holocene, mainly due to the complex evolution history of this trans-continental river. The formation of the First Bend of the Yangtze River likely happened during the late Eocene, resulting from changes in the regional topographic gradient triggered by local magmatic activity and\/or movement of the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault. Onshore and offshore provenance evidence indicate that incision of the Three Gorges happened no later than the late Miocene. Formation of the Square Bend of the Yellow River occurred prior to the late Pliocene, while incision of the Sanmen Gorge, a key capture point connecting the upper-middle and lower Yellow River likely occurred in the early Pleistocene (~1.2\u00a0Ma). Multi-provenance proxies on well-dated and continuous sedimentary records can provide objective information in terms of the origin and evolution of the major rivers flowing from eastern Tibet. Although the evolution of these rivers remains debatable, a comparison among the river evolution, climatic and tectonic events suggests that Eocene local and isolated drainage patterns is likely related to the dry climate condition in the East Asia. Oligocene and late Miocene inlandward expansion and integration of rivers coincides with both the formation of the East Asian Monsoon and the timing of major tectonic events, such as the growth of the Tibetan Plateau and the rifting and opening of the eastern Asian marginal basins, highlighting the importance of climate and tectonics in controlling the evolution of major rivers.\n               ","14":"\n                  The unique self-generation and self-storage characteristics of shale gas allow for its geochemical characteristics to better reflect the gas generation process inside the original rock under geological conditions. Based on a systematic analysis of 541 typical shale gas components and stable isotope compositions worldwide, this review provides an in-depth elucidation of the geochemical characteristics of Silurian shale gas in the Sichuan Basin, including an explanation of its special isotope anomalies. The over-mature Longmaxi Formation shale gas is dominated by alkane gas components (> 99%), which almost entirely (98.7%) consist of methane (CH4). The distinctive characteristics of high CH4 and low C2+ contents result in extremely low wetness of <0.6%, which is typical of dry gas. In view of the sapropelic kerogen origin, the Longmaxi shale gas belongs to late-mature thermogenic gases (LMT). Geochemical anomalies of Longmaxi shale gas mainly refer to abnormally enriched \u03b413C1 values and full reversal, resulting in deviations in carbon isotope composition and light hydrocarbon data for shale gas in the Changning-Zhaotong and Fuling areas, unlike the slightly less thermally evolved Weiyuan area. Noble gases of the Longmaxi shale gas exhibit characteristics of crustal origin and marine carbonate, and the light hydrocarbons in Longmaxi shale gas have been seriously cracked and destroyed, and the residual fraction is more reflective of its chemical stability. At extremely high maturity, the Rayleigh fractionation effect of ethane and the involvement of inorganic material in redox reactions are important causes of isotopic anomalies in Longmaxi shale gas. The variation of \u03b413C1 and \u03b413C2 values of shale gas in the producing area suggests that fluid-rock interactions related to CO2 may have occurred, but not to a significant degree, and the cumulative effects of diffusion are similarly observed. The \u03b413C2 values and magnitude (\u03b413C1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b413C2) of Weiyuan shale gas are negatively and positively correlated with daily production, respectively, which proves that the methane in shale gas mainly comes from ethane cracking during the over-maturation stage. By comparing with typical coal-derived gas, new discriminative trend lines in the reversal zone (\u03b413C1\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b413C2) have a certain degree of credibility and applicability. Unraveling the geological processes that led to the formation of geochemical anomalies in the Longmaxi shale gas can provide valuable insights for in-depth analysis of the late-stage gas generation.\n               ","15":"\n                  MODIS surface reflectance product (R_land) has been used to monitor waters due to its free availability and higher spatial resolution than MODIS ocean bands. However, its applicability in aquatic remote sensing has not been sufficiently assessed. Some fundamental questions such as the following need to be addressed: How does the R_land product perform in global inland and coastal waters? What water color parameters can be mapped using R_land? This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MODIS R_land products against a field optical dataset containing 4143 reflectance spectra, 2320 chlorophyll-a (Chla) samples, and 1467 suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples across global nearshore coastal and inland waters. The results showed that R_land significantly overestimated remote sensing reflectance, particularly in the bands of 469\u00a0nm and 859\u00a0nm. The noticeable negative values and patchiness were found in the R_land imagery, and existing algorithms did not estimate satisfactory Chla and SPM from R_land across the global inland and coastal waters. Furthermore, we tested popular machine-learning approaches, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine, XGBoost, and deep neural networks, to examine the potential of the R_land product in estimating SPM and Chla. Machine learning models were found to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for SPM retrievals from R_land. Specifically, RF and XGBoost showed the good performance with mean absolute errors of ~25.0% and mean absolute percentage error of ~23% for a broad SPM range of 10\u2013500\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121. Yet, machine learning models cannot retrieve reliable Chla from R_land with approximately 55% uncertainty due to the limited spectral information and uncertainty of R_land products. This implicated that R_land might be able to quantify the parameters that are closely related to SPM (e.g., water clarity and extinction coefficients) in most waters; however, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chla in waters from R_land. We conclude that R_land might not be an optimal data source for monitoring inland and coastal waters, despite the ease of using this product and its higher spatial resolution than the MODIS ocean bands.\n               ","16":"\n                  As the archetype of mountain building in subduction zones, the Central Andes has constituted an excellent example for investigating mountain-building processes for decades, but the mechanism by which orogenic growth occurs remains debated. In this study we investigate the Southern Central Andes, between 22\u00b0 and 35\u00b0S, by examining the along-strike variations in Cenozoic uplift history (<45\u00a0Ma) and the amount of tectonic shortening-thickening, allowing us to construct seven continental-scale cross-sections that are constrained by a new thermomechanical model. Our goal is to reconcile the kinematic model explaining crustal shortening-thickening and deformation with the geological constraints of this subduction-related orogen. To achieve this goal a representation of the thermomechanical structure of the orogen is constructed, and the results are applied to constrain the main decollement active for the last 15 Myr. Afterwards, the structural evolution of each transect is kinematically reconstructed through forward modeling, and the proposed deformation evolution is analyzed from a geodynamic perspective through the development of a numerical 2D geodynamic model of upper-plate lithospheric shortening.\n                  In this model, low-strength zones at upper-mid crustal levels are proposed to act both as large decollements that are sequentially activated toward the foreland and as regions that concentrate most of the orogenic deformation. As the orogen evolves, crustal thickening and heating lead to the vanishing of the sharp contrast between low- and high-strength layers. Therefore, a new decollement develops towards the foreland, concentrating crustal shortening, uplift and exhumation and, in most cases, focusing shallow crustal seismicity. The north-south decrease in shortening, from 325\u00a0km at 22\u00b0S to 46\u00a0km at 35\u00b0S, and the cumulated orogenic crustal thicknesses and width are both explained by transitional stages of crustal thickening: from pre-wedge, to wedge, to paired-wedge and, finally, to plateau stages.\n               ","17":"\n                  The global End-Devonian Hangenberg Event was one of the most important mass extinction events during the Phanerozoic eon. The stratigraphical, paleontological, and sedimentological evolution of strata equivalent to the Hangenberg Event have been widely investigated in three depositional environments of shallow-marine platform, of margin and upper slope, and of deep-water facies along the South China Platform. In this representative region within the eastern Paleotethys, the volcanic tuffs, storm deposits, and microbialites deposited during the time of the Hangenberg Event differ from the record of the Hangenberg Crisis in the Rhenish Slate Mountains of Germany, which is a standard for the western Paleotethys. The Upper Crisis Interval (so-called Stockum Limestone Event) in the Rhenish record is interpreted as correlative to the aftermath of the Hangenberg Event in South China rather than a crisis record per se. The unique Cap Microbialite of peloids and oncoids in South China is linked to onset of a new shallow-marine ecosystem characterized by microbe resurgence during a delayed biotic recovery. This microbialite resurgence in association with low-diversity metazoan ecosystems may be a common feature of post-extinction episodes. The new synthesis of records from South China provide insights into global changes that contributed to the Hangenberg biotic extinctions.\n               ","18":"\n                  The failures of engineered dams that retain freshwater or mining waste (tailings) have led to socioeconomic and environmental consequences. However, the global magnitude-frequency statistics of these occurrences remain poorly quantified, out-of-date and\/or limited in scope. Addressing this gap would give insight into how the hazard-risk of water-retention (reservoir) dams and mine tailings impoundments has evolved over time, and would provide quantitative benchmarks for estimating likelihoods of facility failures and their societal impacts to support risk assessments. In this study, we analyze new datasets and estimates of the construction and failures of large reservoir facilities (LRFs) and tailings storage facilities (TSFs) worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. We address long-standing data gaps on LRF failures in China, and subsequently worldwide, and on constructed TSFs worldwide by adopting multiple estimation\/extrapolation approaches to illustrate the range of uncertainty in our results. The total number of LRF failures is estimated to have been between 394 and 608. The annual numbers of newly constructed and failed LRFs declined near-proportionally, thus the cumulative failure rate of LRFs stayed fairly constant, falling in the range of 1.2% to 1.8% as of end-of-2020. The rate drops to at least 0.7% when excluding China. The cumulative fatality rate of LRFs reduced over time to 1.2 deaths per constructed facility, and falls in the range of 64 to 98 deaths per failure, as of end-of-2020. Failures of LRFs with very high storage capacities (>200 million m3) have continued to occur since 2016. The annual number of TSF failures stayed relatively constant, whereas the annual construction rate of TSFs is estimated to have increased by ~3\u00d7, thus the cumulative failure rate of TSFs declined over time. When assuming our lower-estimate of the number of constructed TSFs (6810), the cumulative failure rate is ~4.4% as of end-of-2020. When adopting our upper-estimate (20,230 TSFs), we obtain a rate of ~1.5%, which falls in the same order as the corresponding rate of LRFs. Our review of published estimates of existing TSFs worldwide indicates that the \u201ctrue\u201d rate is much lower than 4.4% and closer to 1.5%. The cumulative fatality rates of TSF failures reduced over time to 0.1\u20130.3 death per constructed facility and 6 deaths per failure as of end-of-2020, which are lower than those of LRFs. However, the size and the environmental impact of TSF failures have increased on average worldwide, especially since 2014. The rising global rate of failed tailings volumes has been approximately proportional to the rising global rate of tailings production since the 1990s. Heavy rainfall events and intensifying precipitation patterns are statistically important causative variables for the failures of both LRFs and TSFs. This has implications for the design and management of storage capacity, freeboard, facility drainage and spillways under climate change conditions. Our results are applicable broadly on a global scale and are conditioned by uncertainties in the data and the methods used to address data gaps. To improve the robustness of future statistical analyses, a more comprehensive public disclosure effort is necessary, particularly with respect to reservoir facility failures in China and constructed TSFs worldwide.\n               ","19":"\n                  The present study is a contribution to the understanding of continental-scale source-to-sink sedimentary systems over geological time scales. The northern half of South America is taken as a case study to explore the relations between (i) continental tectonic boundary conditions (active \/ passive margin, orogenic activity) and intracontinental deformation, (ii) the spatial distribution of clastic sediment sources and sinks over the continent and its margins and (iii) the configuration of the main sediment routes. To do that, the evolving surface configuration of northern South America is investigated through a series of 10 paleo-geological maps compiled for key periods of the Meso-Cenozoic. The maps display (i) sedimentation areas and their depositional environments, (ii) sediment transport routes based on paleocurrent measurements and provenance studies, (iii) magmatic occurrences, (iv) active faults, (v) denudation\/burial histories deduced from low-temperature thermochronology studies and (vi) areas of extensive Cenozoic lateritic cover.\n                  Three main successive continental-scale regimes of the source-to-sink systems are documented. An early erosional regime until ca. 125 Ma is attested to by a major sedimentary hiatus over a long-lasting asthenosphere-supported eroding superswell at the scale of northern South America and northwestern Africa. Sediments were routed from the superswell to the proto-Andean marginal basins, the Central Atlantic rifts\/rifted margin basins and the Saharan cratonic basin. After ca. 125 Ma, a cratonic regime of mixed erosion\/deposition established and maintained until the onset of the Andean orogeny at ca. 85 Ma. During this period, sediment routes from eroding cratonic domains to the proto-Andean margin basins were episodically closed by inherited Paleozoic structures (i.e., \u201carches\u201d), whilst sediment fluxes to cratonic or rifted margin basins were partitioned by Atlantic rift shoulders \/ marginal upwarps of evolving amplitude that formed transient continental divides. After ca. 85 Ma, an Andes-dominated regime installed, in which Andean retro-foreland basins became the main sinks for orogenic sediment fluxes, while exchanges with cratonic basins were controlled by the topographic expression of foreland basins forebulges. Under that regime, cratonic domains mainly acted as by-pass zones for clastic sediments, and their extensive Paleogene and Lower Neogene lateritic covers argue for limited clastic exports from areas exposed to erosion. Very-long wavelength (x 1000 km) asthenospheric support, long-wavelength (x 100 km) lithospheric-scale deformation \/ vertical movements and climate-controlled erosion processes interacted to regulate cratonic sediment source-to-sink regimes of northern South America since 250 Ma.\n               ","20":"\n                  In this article, we review the distributions of metal elements in the crystal structures of olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) and among these major phases in the upper mantle and the mantle transition zone based on reported structure refinements and chemical compositions of both natural and synthetic mineral samples. We discuss the concepts of a potential reservoir of transition metals in the mantle transition zone and the possible alterations of globally observed 410-km and 520-km discontinuities due to metal element substitutions in olivine polymorphs. We also focus on the crystal chemistry of wadsleyite II (the fourth polymorph of olivine) and the effects of this potential constituent mantle phase on the properties of the middle part of the transition zone. A summary of recent studies indicates that, (1) for olivine and wadsleyite, site preference of a transition metal cation in the crystal structure is controlled by multiple factors that include cation size, site geometry, crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE), and oxygen bond-type. These factors may also determine the distributions of transition metal elements among olivine polymorphs; (2) Ni, Cr, and Ti prefer wadsleyite and ringwoodite to olivine, indicating that the mantle transition zone may be a potential reservoir of these transition metal elements, particularly if a small amount of melt is present near phase boundaries; (3) Ni2+, Co2+, and Fe2+ in the crystal structures have significant influences on the thermodynamic properties and phase transitions of olivine polymorphs. The incorporation of minor Ni2+ or Co2+ (>5 at.%) into the octahedral sites in wadsleyite could possibly lead to a shift of the 520-km discontinuity of about 30\u201380\u00a0km to shallower depths. In contrast, the stability field of wadsleyite can be expanded to higher and lower pressures in the presence of Cr3+ and Ti4+. Therefore, the localized high concentrations of these transition metal cations in the mantle transition zone may also contribute to the variations of depth and sharpness in the 410-km and 520-km discontinuities.\n               ","21":"\n                  The Orphan Basin, located offshore northeastern Newfoundland, Eastern Canada, is a Mesozoic rift basin formed during the disintegration of Pangaea and the concurrent opening of the North Atlantic Ocean. The majority of previous work has divided the basin into the East (EOB) and West Orphan (WOB) subbasins, separated by the Central Orphan High (COH). These subbasins share some similarities but have different opening kinematics, timings, and sedimentary histories. Despite its critical location at the termination of the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ), and the transition from the main North Atlantic Ocean to the Labrador Sea, the Orphan Basin remains relatively poorly understood compared to other marginal rift basins in the North Atlantic region. Additionally, much of the public domain geoscientific literature on the basin has not undergone peer review (e.g., conference abstracts, industry reports, etc.). As such, the aim of this review is to critically scrutinize and synthesize the wealth of geoscientific information on the basin, present an overview of the complex structure of the basin and its sedimentary fill, identify knowledge gaps, and provide insights for future research directions. This review highlights that significantly more is known about the EOB than the WOB, largely due to data availability. Furthermore, structural inheritance appears to have strongly influenced the evolution and geometry of rift-related faults. Areas requiring further research include refining the timing and relationship between the opening kinematics of the EOB and WOB, particularly pertaining to the role of the Flemish Cap. Additionally, the continuation of sedimentary facies from the better constrained EOB into the WOB is currently poorly understood, especially for the syn-rift strata, which results in substantial exploration risk in the WOB. Understanding the WOB, including the magmatic rocks, is essential for understanding the wider southern North Atlantic region.\n               ","22":"\n                  With the aim of testing the representativity of detrital zircon U-Pb datasets, we combine new and published data from 31 large river systems in Europe and compare this information with the well-known geology of the continent. Detrital zircon ages range from Archean to Cenozoic and age clusters can be linked to different orogenic cycles and the formation of supercontinents thus representing all relevant geological events in Europe at the continental scale. The Variscan Orogen is the largest episode of crustal reworking in Europe and consequently Variscan detrital zircons occur in all rivers. Other important age clusters are the Alpine 40\u201325\u00a0Ma, post-Alpine 10\u20130.2\u00a0Ma, the Caledonian 490\u2013400\u00a0Ma, and the Avalonian-Cadomian 650\u2013540\u00a0Ma. Detrital zircons of 1170\u2013930\u00a0Ma and 1700\u20131400\u00a0Ma are significant in Scandinavia, as well as 2900\u20132500\u00a0Ma and ca. 1850\u00a0Ma in east Europe.\n                  Although the observed distribution of U-Pb detrital zircon ages is qualitatively representative of the geology of Europe at the continental scale, it is not always the case at the basin scale. Importantly, quantitative representativity for both, basin and continental scales, is not achieved. Variable zircon fertility and the sand generation potential of different lithologies highly bias the U-Pb age distributions. For instance, the magma poor Alpine orogen is relevant in minor age clusters in the Po and Danube rivers, but not in rivers draining to the west and north of the Alps, such as the Rhone and Rhine. Similarly, detrital zircons in the range of 10\u20130.2\u00a0Ma occur only in sediments from the Garonne and Loire rivers, although the Cenozoic igneous provinces are widespread in Europe. Detrital zircons from the post-Variscan Permian rocks were mostly found in the Po and Glomma rivers, where Permian granitoids are more abundant than volcanics of this age. Other natural causes of bias, such as transport and recycling can be identified based on the analyses of size and shape of detrital zircons. In the case of west Europe, our data shows that U-Pb detrital zircon patterns and zircon shape are mainly affected by recycling. Moreover, we tested corrections to the U-Pb age distribution for each river basin based on simple geomorphological parameters obtained from Digital Elevation Models. This attempt to overcome the overrepresentation of certain source regions resulted in a considerable change in age peak proportions towards a better quantitative representativity. However, full representativity seems unachievable, even in studies of modern sedimentary systems with known geology.\n               ","23":"\n                  The Pampean loess is the most extensive continental paleo-record of aeolian material in the Southern Hemisphere, recording the deposition of dust transported by two major zonal wind systems: the southern westerly winds and the subtropical jets. In order to increase the understanding on paleo-atmospheric circulation over the Southern Hemisphere, we evaluate dust provenance through REE, Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes in three sections deposited during late Pleistocene-early Holocene across 700\u00a0km in the loess belt of the Pampean region in central Argentina. The isotopic comparison of loess from the three sections with southern South American (SSA) potential dust sources show that (1) sources from the southern Altiplano to latitudes of northern Patagonia supplied dust to the Pampas, (2) the slight SrNd isotopic difference between fine and coarse loess may be attributable to grain size effects rather than to differences in provenance, and (3) higher mass accumulation rates in the Pampas are associated with an increased presence of dust originated in the southern Altiplano and southern Puna during the spans of 43\u201341\u00a0ka BP, 20\u201318\u00a0ka BP, 14.6\u201312.6\u00a0ka BP and 11.4\u20138.9\u00a0ka BP. We associate these rises in continental dust fluxes with climatic transitions from wetter to drier periods in the Puna-Altiplano Plateau related to synchronous climatic shifts to humid conditions at the Pampean Plain, probably triggered by El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions. The isotopic comparison with modern SSA dust indicates similar provenance compared to paleo-dust records, suggesting almost constant dust sources from MIS 3 to modern times and\/or modest changes in the geochemical signature under the activation\/deactivation of the different dust sources. Moreover, contrasting the isotopic signature of the loess sections with more distal palaeoarchives (i.e., South Atlantic Ocean marine sediment cores and Antarctic ice cores), the new data suggest that contrary to previous ideas, the Pampean Loess was not an important source of dust to these regions. Also, a common dust provenance during cold periods (e.g., Last Glacial Maximum and Antarctic Cold Reversal) supports the idea that changes in atmospheric transport efficiency can better explain dust flux variations observed over glacial\/interglacial periods in distant palaeoarchives than changes in provenance.\n               ","24":"\n                  Increasing consideration is being given as to whether and how the subsoil can be utilised as a resource to store greater quantities of organic carbon through a range of \u2018frontier' technologies. However, recent work suggests \u2018priming\u2019 effects may occur when fresh soil organic carbon (SOC) is mixed with older organic carbon (OC). Combined with increasing intensity of land use and perturbation of the surface environment there is potential for buried organic carbon (OC) to be re-incorporated into the active global C cycle. Therefore, understanding the nature of existing buried organic carbon (OC) within Soil Parent Material (SPM) and landscapes is increasingly important. A major OC burial route within landscapes is via erosion and deposition processes. This paper aims to provide a \u2018first order' overview of the role erosion processes have made since the UK Last Glacial Maximum (UK-LGM) in the burial of OC in Great Britain. Using collated information, Monte-Carlo simulations were used to produce \u2018first-order' estimates of the mass of OC buried within three deposit types; Devensian Till, Devensian Glacio-fluvial deposits and Holocene Alluvium. Combined median estimates for these three deposit types alone suggest, that 385 MT of OC has been buried in these deposits across Great Britain, demonstrating the importance of post UK-LGM erosion processes in long-term sequestration of OC. The paper provides a basis of a framework to describe where buried OC may be found within UK SPM and landscapes, whilst identifying gaps in our knowledge base. Whilst focusing on Great Britain, the processes are relevant to many countries, each of which will have experienced erosion processes unique to their own history of geology, geomorphology and climate.\n               ","25":"\n                  Debris flows are among the most catastrophic natural phenomena, attracting the interest of researchers, engineers and government agencies. The complexity of the physical process has led to the development of numerous mathematical models to simulate and deeper understand the propagation of debris flows. Nevertheless, the intrinsic characteristics of models are not all suitable for every process observed in nature. Hence, this review identifies the main features of the different modelling approaches for debris flows and proposes recommendations for a more rigorous selection of models. The classification of the models is based on the following features: (1) phases of the flow; (2) entrainment of materials into the flow; (3) constitutive relationships; (4) spatial dimensionality; and (5) the solution methods. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the most remarkable contributions by comparing the available mathematical models for debris flows based on each feature. A selection strategy is proposed to be supported by the main assumptions of the models, the classification features and some dimensionless numbers evoked in debris flow research. As a result of this review, the principal considerations can be summarised as follows. First, the complexity of the models has been increasing with the enhanced understanding of debris flows and advances in technology. Thus, the multiphase approach, more sophisticated constitutive relationships, three-dimensional representations and numerical methods requiring higher computational cost are becoming noteworthy. Secondly, three-dimensional representations are better suited for the study of specific and small-scale debris-flow processes, while the two-dimensional depth-averaged approach is still the most appropriate for field applications. Finally, the most recognised and recent models are highlighted and concisely compiled in a table to provide an overview of the options.\n               ","26":"\n                  Ferromanganese nodules (FMNs) are common products of pedogenesis and differ significantly from the surrounding soil matrix in terms of morphology, microstructure, and chemical composition. FMNs have direct impacts on nutrient cycles and heavy metal adsorption, and the concentric ring structure (or undifferentiated fabric) of FMNs can serve as fingerprints in assessing the paleoclimatic conditions and pedogenic environments. Despite the extensive research on the formation, characteristics and environmental implications of FMNs, little is done in terms of review highlights of the research achievements, gaps and future directions in this field. This paper reviewed and summarized the advances and achievements in the research of pedogenic FMNs, including i) formation mechanisms, evolution processes, and influencing factors of FMNs; ii) variations in micromorphology, elemental contents, and mineral compositions of FMNs in different soil types; and iii) sorption, substitution, and fixation of soil nutrients and heavy metals by FMNs. The areas of future studies included: i) determining the age, formation rate, and environmental threshold of FMNs at different stages of pedogenesis using numerical dating techniques; ii) establishing FMN evolution models for both natural and anthropogenic soils to better understand the complex changes of FMNs; and iii) clarifying the processes and mechanisms governing the fixation and re-activation of soil nutrients and heavy metals by FMNs via combined controlled experiments and isotope techniques. Addressing the above areas requires multidisciplinary collaborations, multi-analytical techniques and advanced isotope chronology. Clearly, the potential exists to vastly improve mechanistic understanding of FMN formation and evolution and the ways in which this can influence biogeochemical cycles.\n               ","27":"\n                  The Singhbhum craton of eastern India contains an almost continuous depositional record from the Paleoarchean to the Neoproterozoic. Although researchers have examined the Mesoarchean to Neoproterozoic geological history in the last decade, the Paleoarchean sedimentological inventory is poor and the crust-mantle interaction is poorly constrained. Here we present new sedimentological data from the Paleoarchean-early Mesoarchean eastern Iron Ore Group (EIOG) from the Singhbhum craton, India and critically synthesize the earlier published data to constrain the depositional setting of the EIOG succession. Two distinct facies associations characterize the EIOG succession: while the lower facies association is marine and indicates initial shallowing and subsequent deepening of the sea level, the upper facies association is terrestrial (alluvial fan-fluvial) with an unconformable lower contact. The upper facies association formed because of continental emersion at around 3300\u00a0Ma. The ultramafic (komatiite)-mafic (minor felsic) volcanic rocks indicate mantle plume activity and crustal contamination. Carbon isotopic analysis of the carbonaceous matter (CM) preserved within the lower facies association reveals that these are syngenetic with the host rock without any evidence of migration of bitumen and modern organic contamination. A peak metamorphic temperature around 450\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C is inferred from Raman spectroscopic analysis of the CM. Intensive paleobiological research is of paramount interest to decode the co-evolution of life and environment and the mysteries of early Earth.\n               ","28":"\n                  The internal zones of the Western Alps arc are derived from an oceanic and continental subduction wedge developed beneath the Adria plate during its paleogene northward drift. Exhumation of the internal zones proceded from early Oligocene onwards due to westward extrusion of the Adria plate. The prominent fold-and-thrust structures which follow the arc shape, either forward or backward verging, postdate the initial nappe stacking and overprint differently oriented older deformations which are relevant to proper retoration of this arcuate orogen to minimise overlap problems. We document this early stacking phase through outcrop-scale structural analysis at 55 sites between the Maurienne and Ubaye valleys, along with larger-scale examples of early structures. They consistently show an initial N- to NW tectonic transport, whose kinematic indicators are overprinted by either forward (W- to SW-directed) or backward (E- to NE-directed) deformation associated with post-nappe transport along the Penninic thrust. Accordingly, restoring the Brian\u00e7onnais fold\/thrust system must incorporate reconstruction of the nappe stack along the initial top N-NW direction of orogenic propagation, with careful consideration of their paleogeographic origin towards the S-SE. This stack was built during the Eocene Adria-Iberia collision, and overthrust the Subbrian\u00e7onnais-Valaisan trough to the NW before involving the Dauphin\u00e9-Helvetic foreland. It includes different types of Paleozoic units, either Permo-Carboniferous sediments towards its base, or polymetamorphic basement above, which can be explained by inversion of a late Variscan basin and of its southern shoulder, whereas the uppermost Prepiedmont units result from inversion of the Tethyan margin toe. Mixed breccia, locally preserved close to the tectonic contact between the latter units and the overlying \"Schistes Lustr\u00e9s\" oceanic nappes, are interpreted as olistostromes fed by both units in a very early collision stage. 39Ar\/40Ar dating suggests that these shallow tectono-sedimentary formations were involved in the subduction wedge during the early Eocene, whereas younger (late Eocene) equivalent olistostromes mark the propagation of the Brian\u00e7onnais stack over the external (Dauphin\u00e9\/Helvetic) foreland. The Eocene orogenic wedge was rapidly exhumed during Oligocene westward indentation and radial spreading, in a markedly different tectonic context driven by extrusion around an Adriatic upper mantle indenter, which controlled development of the Western Alps arc in relation with the Ligurian sea opening.\n               ","29":"\n                  The offshore Chinese basins are located in the transition zone from the East Asia to the Western Pacific plate. The Cenozoic evolution of these basins reflects the geodynamic processes in East Asia. However, the coupling of the evolution of the offshore Chinese basins to the geodynamic processes occurring in the East Asian continental margin is still poorly understood. Here, the rifting processes of the offshore Chinese basins and the relationship between the basin evolution and the geodynamic processes of the East Asia Plate were analyzed using seismic data, fault activity, syn-sedimentary fault maps, and isopach maps. In the Offshore Bohai Bay Basin, the regional extension and local shearing occurred simultaneously. Accordingly, the regional NNW-SSE extension and local NNE-strike-slip shearing resulted in the NNE-striking graben-horst structure in the Liaodong Bay area while the NW-striking extensional faults and NNE-striking transtensional faults jointly control the structure of the Bozhong area. In addition, the NNE-striking branches of the Tan-lu Fault Zone led to the pull-apart structure in the Bonan area, and the NW-striking normal faults governed the half-graben structure in the Boxi area. Two stages of eastward movement of the rifting center in the East China Sea Basin were triggered by a change in the direction of subduction of the Pacific plate at ~43\u00a0Ma, and subduction of the Philippine Sea plate at ~20\u00a0Ma, respectively. In the South China Sea (SCS), Paleocene to E. Eocene initial extension occurred in the present northern and southern marginal basins of the SCS. Subsequently, the Ailao Shan Red River shear zone (ASRRSZ) traversed the eastern margin of the Indochina block, and pull-apart rifting dominated in the basins along this fault. Combined with the southward slab pull of proto-SCS and the strike-slip movement of ASRRSZ, sea floor spreading occurred, and the southern marginal basins drifted southerly and apart from the South China from 33 to 16\u00a0Ma.\n               ","30":"\n                  Over the past few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the impact of interplanetary bodies on other planetary bodies is one of the most ubiquitous and important geological processes in the Solar System. This impact process has played a fundamental role throughout the history of the Earth and other planetary bodies, resulting in both destructive and beneficial effects. The impact cratering record of Earth is critical to our understanding of the processes, products, and effects of impact events. In this contribution, we provide an up-to-date review and synthesis of the impact cratering record on Earth. Following a brief history of the Impact Earth Database (available online at http:\/\/www.impactearth.com), the definition of the main categories of impact features listed in the database, and an overview of the impact cratering process, we review and summarize the required evidence to confirm impact events. Based on these definitions and criteria, we list 188 hypervelocity impact craters and 13 impact craters (i.e., impact sites lacking evidence for shock metamorphism). For each crater, we provide details on key attributes, such as location, date confirmed, erosional level, age, target properties, diameter, and an overview of the shock metamorphic effects and impactites that have been described in the literature. We also list a large number of impact deposits, which we have classified into four main categories: tektites, spherule layers, occurrences of other types of glass, and breccias. We discuss the challenges of recognizing and confirming impact events and highlight weaknesses, contradictions, and inconsistencies in the literature.\n                  We then address the morphology and morphometry of hypervelocity impact craters. Based on the Impact Earth Database, it is apparent that the transition diameter from simple to complex craters for craters developed in sedimentary versus crystalline target rocks is less pronounced than previously reported, at approximately 3\u00a0km for both. Our analysis also yields an estimate for stratigraphic uplift of 0.0945D0.6862, which is lower than previous estimates. We ascribe this to more accurate diameter estimates plus the variable effects of erosion. It is also clear that central topographic peaks in terrestrial complex impact craters are, in general, more subdued than their lunar counterparts. Furthermore, a number of relatively well-preserved terrestrial complex impact structures lack central peaks entirely. The final section of this review provides an overview of impactites preserved in terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters. While approximately three quarters of hypervelocity impact craters on Earth preserve some portion of their crater-fill impactites, ejecta deposits are known from less than 10%. In summary, the Impact Earth Database provides an important new resource for researchers interested in impact craters and the impact cratering process and we welcome input from the community to ensure that the Impact Earth website (http:\/\/www.impactearth.com\n                     ) is a living resource that is as accurate and as up-to-date, as possible.\n               ","31":"\n                  K-Ar and Ar\/Ar illite geochronology are powerful and versatile tools that can be used to provide age constraints on diverse geological processes such as diagenesis, hydrothermalism, and low-temperature metamorphism and deformation in the brittle and ductile-brittle regimes. However, the interpretation of illite Ar dates can be difficult, especially since results from grain-size fractionated samples are typically grain-size dependent, with the finest fractions yielding the youngest dates. This is usually the result of a mixed isotopic signal, caused by a physical mixture between different populations, by partial isotopic and\/or chemical resetting, or by a recurrent crystallization history. In order to extract meaningful ages from such datasets, two main lines of interpretation exist: assuming that end fractions (i.e., the finest and coarsest materials of a sample) constitute limit ages, or extrapolating \u201cpure\u201d authigenic and inherited ages using quantifiable mineralogical parameters (such as polytype composition). The two strategies are tested using a well-constrained case study from very low-grade metamorphic samples from the Rhenish Massif (Germany). Six fractionated samples from a continuous outcrop produce internally consistent K-Ar ages that can be interpreted in terms of limit ages and are supported by illite \u201ccrystallinity\u201d and polytype composition. Nonetheless, extrapolation of dates from clastic metasedimentary rocks into \u201cpure\u201d end-member ages (illite age analyses - IAA) result in geologically meaningless results that could only be recognized as such because of the analysis of intercalated detritus-free metatuffs. The reason for this is that some of the fundamental premises for the extrapolation of illite ages are not satisfied. These premises are: authigenic and inherited illite populations must be homogeneous in their mineralogical compositions; authigenic illite must have been crystallized during a single near-instantaneous event; and both authigenic and inherited populations must have the same K content. The case study demonstrates the importance of interrogating the limitations and the premises of any treatment of geochronological data in order to avoid over-interpretation. Both strategies for interpreting illite dates are complementary and none is intrinsically better than the other. Because of this complexity, it is important to validate and complement illite argon geochronology by acquiring large datasets and performing additional analyses.\n               ","32":"\n                  This paper presents the computational basis for the study of Walzer and Hendel (2022), who consider the relationships between continental growth, sedimentary geology, natural climate change, and ice ages. Here we solve the full set of balance equations for mass, energy, momentum, and angular momentum for a 3D spherical-shell mantle. The assumed radial distribution of viscosity is given in Appendix B. Furthermore, the modeled viscosity depends on temperature and water concentration. The modeled mantle is internally heated by the radioactive decay of 238U, 235U, 232Th, and 40K. The heat-producing elements are redistributed by chemical differentiation in spatial regions due to partial melting. Thus, in a simplified way, continental material is formed, which accumulates at the surface of a sphere, moves sideways in a non-prescribed way due to flow, and accretes to form continents. The growth curve of the total mass of continental crust resembles that of realistic geological models. We present in Appendix B the Gr\u00fcneisen parameter, adiabatic temperature, thermal expansivity, and specific heat as a function of depth. The temporal distribution of juvenile additions to the continents, as obtained using our model, has a marked resemblance to global detrital zircon ages published by Puetz and Condie (2019, 2022). The results indicate the continental crust grew in an episodic manner rather than by steady state.\n               ","33":"\n                  This study reviews plant species richness and abundance change from the End Permian to Middle Triassic in South China and examines the co-evolutionary relationship between the flora and the environment through this critical interval in the history of terrestrial biotas. A normalized macro-fossil plant record, that considers only one taxon per whole plant, is produced. This identifies four broad phases of plant evolution. Phase 1 is marked by pre-extinction floras that demonstrate a long-term decline of species richness beginning in the Late Permian (lower Changhsingian) that culminates in the distinct End Permian Plant Crisis (EPPC) at the end of the Changhsingian. Other evidence for the health of the flora, including palynology, biomarkers, wildfire proxies, soil erosion and weathering proxies show a drastic loss of plant abundance (biomass) and increase of wildfire frequency (suggestive of increasing seasonal aridity) during the EPPC. A Phase 2 survival interval, during the Changhsingian\u2013Griesbachian transition, has a severely impoverished plant assemblage consisting of opportunistic lycopods and a short-lived holdover flora. Phase 3 (Late Griesbachian\u2013Smithian) saw the modest recovery of species richness as several groups began to radiate, notably conifers and ferns. Diversity increases substantially and persistently during the succeeding Phase 4 and sees the dominant lycopods\/herbaceous bryophytes of Phase 3 replaced by conifer-dominated floras. Plant abundance recovery began earlier than the resumption of coal formation which only initiated in the Anisian following its disappearance during the EPPC. Only in the Late Triassic did the flora recover to a level comparable to that seen in the Permian. The flora of South China thus took ~15 million years to completely recover from the profound environmental and climatic effects of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction.\n               ","34":"\n                  Landslide susceptibility corresponds to the probability of landslide occurrence across a given geographic space. This probability is usually estimated by using a binary classifier which is informed of landslide presence\/absence data and associated landscape characteristics. Here, we consider the Italian national landslide inventory to prepare slope-unit based landslide susceptibility maps. These maps are prepared for the eight types of mass movements existing in the inventory, (Complex, Deep Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation, Diffused Fall, Fall, Rapid Flow, Shallow, Slow Flow, Translational) and we build one susceptibility map for each type. The analysis \u2013 carried out by using a Bayesian version of a Generalized Additive Model with a multiple intercept for each Italian region \u2013 revealed that the inventory may have been compiled with different levels of detail. This would be consistent with the dataset being assembled from twenty sub\u2013inventories, each prepared by different administrations of the Italian regions. As a result, this spatial heterogeneity may lead to biased national\u2013scale susceptibility maps. On the basis of these considerations, we further analyzed the national database to confirm or reject the varying quality hypothesis on the basis of the model equipped with multiple regional intercepts. For each landslide type, we then tried to build unbiased susceptibility models by removing regions with a poor landslide inventory from the calibration stage, and used them only as a prediction target of a simulation routine. We analyzed the resulting eight maps finding out a congruent dominant pattern in the Alpine and Apennine sectors.\n                  The whole procedure is implemented in R\u2013INLA. This allowed to examine fixed (linear) and random (nonlinear) effects from an interpretative standpoint and produced a full prediction equipped with an estimated uncertainty.\n                  We propose this overall modeling pipeline for any landslide datasets where a significant mapping bias may influence the susceptibility pattern over space.\n               ","35":"\n                  Circulation of water masses, sediment, and biotope between the sub-basins of the Mediterranean Sea strongly depends on morphological oceanic gateways. These geological features react to geodynamic reorganisation through volcanism, vertical movements, and\/or the segmentation of sedimentary basins. Despite the palaeogeographic relevance of straits and oceanic-gateways, their evolution and impact on sedimentary transports and deposition in the Mediterranean remain in general poorly constrained. The Gargano-Pelagosa gateway is here first recognized as an influential element of the palaeogeographic\/environmental evolution of the central-southern Apenninic foredeep and wedge-top domains during the Messinian, as shown by the integration of (i) seismic lines, (ii) well information from the Adriatic Sea, and (iii) a review of both onshore and offshore structural data and Messinian depositional environments. A palinspastic evolution is proposed for the Apennine and south Adriatic foredeeps during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC: 5.97\u20135.33\u00a0Ma). We highlight the implication of the pre-MSC structural legacy and the development of the Apennine and Dinarid-Albanian chains in 1) the isolation of the Apennine foredeep from the deep central Mediterranean domains at the peak of the MSC; 2) the vertical movements at the Gargano-Pelagosa structure and the Apulian Platform and 3) their implication in the deposition of a chaotic sedimentary body.\n               ","36":"\n                  The present comprehensive multidisciplinary geophysical study provides new insights into the structural architecture and tectonic development of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin during the transform opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The study integrates magnetic, gravity, and seismic data and adds to the knowledge of the prebreakup geotectonic setting of West Gondwana, shedding light on the role of the Precambrian heritage in the crustal compartmentalization of the Equatorial Atlantic margins into divergent and transform segments. Additionally, we improved previous evolution models of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin, considering the nature of the crustal domains and processes related to the initial breakup of West Gondwana. Our geophysical datasets reveal that the Brazilian Equatorial Margin encompasses two crustal domains with distinct internal architecture and thermomechanical parameters divided by the Transbrasiliano Lineament. The western crustal block is composed of a thicker and older lithosphere, which acted as an obstacle to continental rupture. The resulting breakup occurred further north, while the crustal block east of the Transbrasiliano Lineament disrupted relatively further south. Two different rift systems thinned both crustal domains during a former rift phase before the subsequent and ultimate rift phase broke up the continental crust and initiated seafloor spreading under a transform regime. After the breakup between the South American and African continents, dextral strike-slip movements along oceanic fracture zones divided the Brazilian Equatorial Margin into divergent and transform segments, whose inner and outer intersections are identified in the present study. The marginal ridges represent basement uplifts separated from the continental hinterland by pull-apart basins deformed by negative structure-like flower structures. The prebreakup Precambrian structures played a key role in margin segmentation, behaving as crustal weakness zones and nucleating transform faults at the boundaries of the divergent margin segments.\n               ","37":"\n                  Subduction initiation is one of the main unsolved issues in plate tectonics theory with different proposed mechanisms. In the arc (plateau, terrane)-continent collision models, a new subduction zone can be induced by subduction polarity reversal or subduction transference. In this study, I have reviewed the typical natural examples and numerical models for the subduction initiation of polarity reversal and subduction transference, and then summarized the key characteristics, geological records, and future directions of the subduction initiation. The subduction polarity reversal usually occurs at intraoceanic arc settings, but the subduction transference often happens at active continental margins as well as intraoceanic arc settings. Natural examples of subduction polarity reversal and subduction transference have representative geological records of supra-subduction zones (SSZ) ophiolites (ophiolitic m\u00e9langes) and metamorphic soles, which have long been recognized as the key to understanding the subduction initiation and geodynamic processes, because both are rock records of upper plate extension and lower plate burial, respectively. Weak zones and driving forces are required for the collision-induced subduction polarity reversal and subduction transference, which generally occurs about 10 Myr after collision both in natural observations and numerical models. However, subduction transference happens about 10\u201330 Myr after the collision in the Proto-, Paleo-, and Neo-Tethys oceans. Numerical models of the subduction initiation moving from 2D to 3D will break through the constraints of the 2D geometric model and better simulate the subduction initiation processes. However, the parameters used in the numerical modelling are not yet able to fully describe the various controlling factors of the subduction initiation. Moreover, the mechanism of weak rheology and its effect on the subduction initiation are still ambiguous and need further study by natural observations and numerical modelling.\n               ","38":"\n                  Satellite imageries are an important geoinformation source for different applications in the Earth Science field. However, due to the limitation of the optic and sensor technologies and the high cost to update the sensors and equipments, the spectral and spatial resolution of the Earth Observation satellites may not meet the desired requirements. Thus, Remote Sensing Image Super-resolution (RSISR) which aims at restoring the high-resolution (HR) remote sensing images from the given low-resolution (LR) images has drawn considerable attention and witnessed the rapid development of the deep learning (DL) algorithms. In this research, we aim to comprehensively review the DL-based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods on optical remote sensing images. First, we introduce the DL techniques utilized in SISR. Second, we summarize the RSISR algorithms thoroughly, including the DL models, commonly used remote sensing datasets, loss functions, and performance evaluation metrics. Third, we present a new multi-sensor dataset that consists of Very High-Resolution satellite images from different satellites of various landscapes and evaluate the performance of some state-of-the-art super-resolution methods on this dataset. Finally, we envision the challenges and future research in the RSISR field.\n               ","39":"\n                  Evaporite deposition and seafloor spreading are two salient geological processes in the geological history of the Red Sea. We piece together the available evidence about rift evolution and evaporite formation to constrain the deposition history, analyze creep, and advance a plausible explanation for the preservation of these soluble formations. At the end of evaporite deposition before the Indian Ocean flooded the Red Sea through the Bab al-Mandab's strait, the salt thickness must have exceeded ~1.5 times the current thickness. Reported plate rotation, rift rates and the presence of a salt suture zone in the central Red Sea allow us to estimate an effective large-scale viscosity of 1018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s. Thinned salt along the southern Red Sea flows up to 5\u00a0mm\/yr, creep cannot keep up with seafloor spreading and oceanic crust remains exposed. Vast alluvial fans and carbonate platforms cause salt withdrawal; corresponding seafloor settlement rates can exceed ~10\u00a0mm\/yr and overtake coral reef production. Salt dissolution leaves behind a residual sediment cap made of insoluble minerals that gradually retards further dissolution, i.e., self-armoring. New experimental evidence and the numerical solution of diffusion with a moving boundary show that self-armoring by selective dissolution controls early evaporite dissolution while background sedimentation dominates sediment accumulation over long time scales. Armoring-delayed evaporite dissolution prevents the formation of a vast regional brine pool.\n               ","40":"\n                  The evolution of the Retiolitinae marks one of the most important events in the evolution of the planktic graptolites (Graptoloidea), leading to a diversification of genera and species in the early Silurian oceans still highly underestimated and poorly understood. The complex tubarium construction of the Silurian Retiolitinae is reviewed using a unified concept to describe constructional details of their tubaria apparently formed from an intricate arrangement of lists, but actually based on the dual development of thecal and ancora sleeve membranes that are rarely preserved in the fossil record. Constructional characters are identified and compared between the diverse genera, based on well-preserved chemically isolated material from dominantly carbonate lithologies. It shows that a homologization of the tubarium characters, essential for the understanding of their construction and the interpretation of evolutionary relationships, often appears to be impossible for material preserved as flattened shale specimens. The separation of the ancora sleeve features from thecal features in the Retiolitinae is a key for the recognition of the characters preserved in the fossil specimens. The loss of certain tubarium characters defines various genera and separates or connects them to others. About 32 genera of retiolitines are now recognized from the ca. 15 MA long time interval (ca. 425\u2013440 MA) in the Silurian, in which retiolitine graptolites flourished and presented a high percentage of the graptolite faunal diversity. The fossil record has provided chemically isolatable taxa from carbonate rocks in small parts of this lithological column only. Thus, the time interval is dominated by extensive biostratigraphical gaps from which we have very little information on retiolitine faunas, their constructional changes and evolutionary relationships. The transition across the Lundgreni Extinction Event, an event that has led to the near extinction of the planktic graptoloids in the early Homerian (Wenlock), shows a distinct change in the construction of the retiolitines and the evolution of important new features. The diverse pre-extinction faunas disappear and new taxa originate in the aftermath of the extinction. The spotty record of retiolitine fossils with its high number of described taxa indicates fast evolutionary changes during this time interval that we have barely started to understand.\n               ","41":"\n                  Following a decade during which its presence was widely accepted, the existence of the putative Ediacaran supercontinent Pannotia has come into question since the turn of the millenium, largely due to the geochronology of Ediacaran-Cambrian orogens, which suggests that the supposed landmass had begun to break up well before it was fully assembled. Paleomagnetic data from this time interval have been used to both support and refute the existence of Pannotia, but are notoriously equivocal. Proxy signals for Ediacaran-Cambrian supercontinent assembly and breakup, although collectively compelling, can be individually challenged, and efforts to detect the mantle legacy expected of supercontinent amalgamation, while promising, are inconclusive. Yet the existence of Pannotia is central to the nature, duration and evolution of the supercontinent cycle, and dictates the cycle\u2019s geodynamic pathway from the breakup of Rodinia to the assembly of Pangea. Hence, the question of Pannotia\u2019s existence, like that of Hamlet, is one of fundamental importance and demands far more attention than it has hitherto received.\n               ","42":"\n                  Lacustrine shale oil represents an important opportunity for unconventional petroleum exploration and has received considerable attention from petroleum geologists. However, the assessment of oil content and resource quality of shale oil reservoirs with substantial heterogeneity and the determination of favorable exploration targets challenge geologists and petroleum explorers. Numerous methods and models have been proposed to evaluate the oil content and resource quality of shale oil accumulations. However, the scope of applying different methods and models varies. This study reviews the methods and models for assessing oil content and resource quality of lacustrine shale and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, a three-dimensional model for evaluating the resource quality of shale oil plays based on multistep pyrolysis parameters is proposed and applied to a case study of the shales of the Jurassic Daanzhai Formation (J1zD) in the Langzhong area of the Sichuan Basin, SW China. To improve the model applicability, a simple algorithm for the total oil yield (TOY) is proposed, which can be used for a rapid and accurate evaluation of the resource quality of a shale play for which only routine pyrolysis data are available. The relative proportions of enriched, potential, less efficient, and invalid resources of the studied Daanzhai shales are estimated to be 66.7%, 14.1%, 0.5%, and 18.7%, respectively. Compared to the evaluation models based on routine Rock-Eval pyrolysis, the new model proposed in this study exhibits the following advantages: (1) the ability to characterize the resource quality of a shale reservoir in terms of geochemical characteristics and oil movability; (2) the consideration of the influence of thermal maturity on the resource quality of shale oil plays; and (3) the use of multistep pyrolysis for establishing the quality evaluation method. The proposed model can allow the determination of favorable areas for shale oil exploration in other basins in the world, improve exploration efficiency, and reduce risks.\n               ","43":"\n                  The Aravalli Craton, representing the Precambrian nucleus of northwestern India, consists of the Archean Banded Gneissic Complex (BGC; 3.3\u20132.5 Ga) overlain by Paleoproterozoic (~2.2\u20131.7 Ga) and Paleo- to Neoproterozoic (~1.7\u20130.7 Ga) metasedimentary sequences of the Aravalli and Delhi supergroups, respectively. The extensively reworked Late Paleoproterozoic terrane located between the Aravalli and Delhi supracrustal sequences is known as the Sandmata Complex. The BGC, Sandmata Complex and supracrustal sequences, collectively known as Aravalli Craton, were developed by multiple accretionary-collisional processes from ~3.3 to 0.7 Ga and are regarded as classical terranes for understanding Precambrian crustal evolution. The previous multidisciplinary studies have invariably described the litho-tectonic relationships of the Aravalli Craton. Considering the voluminous literature and arguable interpretations, we present a holistic review addressing the Mesoarchean to Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the basement and the polydeformed supracrustal sequences of Aravalli and Delhi supergroups. We suggest that the Aravalli Craton evolved by the accretionary-collisional interactions between three major crustal domains, viz., the Mewar gneissic terrane and intrusive granitoids (~3.3\u20132.5 Ga), the Aravalli fold belt (~2.2\u20131.7 Ga) and the Delhi fold belt (~1.7\u20130.7 Ga). The Mewar gneissic terrane formed between 3.3 Ga and 2.7 Ga by partial melting of hydrated mafic crust, where the terrane evolved continuously and finally stabilized due to the collision between the Bundelkhand and Aravalli cratons, resulting in the emplacement of several granitoids between 2.6 and 2.4 Ga. The subsequent development of the Aravalli fold belt (~2.2\u20131.7 Ga) to the west of Mewar gneissic terrane was characterized by the ~2.2\u20132.1 Ga mafic-ultramafic volcanism and ~1.8\u20131.7 Ga felsic magmatism, marking the opening and closing of the Aravalli Basin, respectively. The final closure of this basin was contemporaneous with the exhumation of the Sandmata granulite terrane along the western margin of Aravalli fold belt. Although the Sandmata Complex was previously interpreted as a reworked equivalent of the basement gneisses, based on contrasting lithology, deformation styles and metamorphic grade, we infer that the Sandmata Complex possibly represents an independent terrane with a distinct tectonothermal history. The tectonic evolution of the Delhi Basin most likely took place in two stages from ~1.7 to 0.7 Ga. The initial stage (~1.7\u20131.4 Ga) led to the development of the north Delhi fold belt and emplacement of A-type granitoids (~1.5\u20131.4 Ga), whereas the high-grade metamorphism and I- and S-type granite magmatism in the southern part characterize the later stage (~1.3\u20130.7 Ga) of the Delhi Basin. Following the Delhi Basin closure, the areas to the west of the Aravalli Craton witnessed the emplacement of the Malani Igneous Suite and the development of the Sirohi and Marwar basins. Altogether, the available key information on structural patterns, magmatic-metamorphic histories and geochronology allows more detailed correlations with possible contiguous orogens of the Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt. Our synthesis and tectonic interpretations help us discuss and provide alternate explanations for some of the controversial issues from existing tectonic models. Further, we summarize important unresolved issues, which require special attention to improve our knowledge of the Archean to Proterozoic crustal evolution in northwestern India.\n               ","44":"\n                  Phytoplankton form the base of most marine trophic chains and studying their past diversity at regional and global scales can provide valuable insights into the evolution of marine ecosystems and climate history. Using a new database of more than 4000 species of acritarchs and prasinophytes, a comprehensive investigation of the taxonomic diversity trajectories of this marine (micro)phytoplankton throughout the Paleozoic is performed for the first time. This dataset compiles data from published literature, including taxonomic, geographic and stratigraphic information at the stage resolution. Our results highlight five major temporal trends in phytoplankton diversity variation: (i) an initial plateau of moderate richness during the early and middle Cambrian, followed by (ii) a sharp increase from the late Cambrian to the Middle Ordovician, which records the highest Paleozoic diversity of organic-walled phytoplankton (OWP); then, (iii) a protracted decrease during the Late Ordovician to Middle Devonian; (iv) a slight peak in diversity during the Late Devonian, before (v) falling to the lowest richness recorded during the Carboniferous and Permian. The role of phytoplankton during major biotic events is discussed: While phytoplankton evolution may have been a factor in enabling the \u201cCambrian Explosion\u201d, we do not find a strong relationship between the diversity changes of the phytoplankton and this event and we thus refute the notion that it might have been a major driver of radiations during this interval. However, a strong increase in phytoplankton diversity coincides with the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), indicating that the profound changes of marine phytoplankton, and thus of the base of marine food webs, enabled diversifications throughout marine ecosystems. A decrease in phytoplankton diversity during the Lower and Middle Devonian points against the hypothesis of phytoplankton triggering the proposed \u201cDevonian Nekton Revolution\u201d. By comparing the results with paleoenvironmental parameters, several factors are found to be possibly related to the long-term diversity trends: Our results indicate that paleogeography and sea-level changes were probably the main drivers of phytoplankton diversity patterns throughout the Paleozoic, while increases in sediment influx provided facilitating conditions for phytoplankton diversification. Atmospheric CO2 concentration as well as temperature and related sea ice cover are found to be further important controlling factors for phytoplankton diversity.\n               ","45":"\n                  Known as the \"third pole\" and \"water tower of Asia\", the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the home to the largest number of glaciers in the mid-latitudes and one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change due to its special geographical location and powerful thermodynamic effects. In recent years, the TP has been affected by exogenous pollutants and the concentrations of some pollutants have shown an increasing trend, especially light-absorbing aerosols (LAAs), when ice core records, ground- and aircraft-based field campaigns and satellite technology enabled synthesized monitoring. The enhanced warming of the vast majority of regions in TP, together with Arctic warming, and snow\/ice decline, represents credible evidence of anthropogenic climate change. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on the sources, characteristics and climate impacts of LAAs over the TP. Adjacent to the two major emission sources of LAAs in East Asia and South Asia, the unique geographical location and climatic characteristics of the TP make it possible for TP LAAs to cause atmospheric warming and accelerated glacier melting, affecting the hydrological cycle in South Asia, East Asia and even the Northern Hemisphere, thus causing a series of serious environmental and social problems. LAAs, such as black carbon and dust, can strongly absorb solar radiation and and have significantly influence on climate change. Moreover, light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) on snow\/ice can reduce the snow\/ice albedo and further accelerate the snow\/ice melting. Both LAAs and LAIs over the TP can induce thermodynamic feedback processes, cause significant warming of the TP and then lead to a strengthening of the early monsoon and affect the subsequent evolution of the monsoon. Many mechanisms have been proposed forth regarding how TP LAAs modulate the phase, intensity, and amplitude of the Asian climate system. A wide range of theoretical, observational, and modeling findings on TP LAAs and their climate impacts are synthesized, in which dust aerosols from drylands and black carbon from biomass burning are considered leading components. By coupling an integrated approach with state-of-the-art modeling, high temporal and fine spatial resolution remote sensing observations with increasing sampling over the TP will provide further insights into TP aerosols.\n               ","46":"\n                  The chemistry of Fe and Mn in natural geochemical systems are closely coupled, as Fe and Mn always co-exist in various forms (e.g., hydrated ions, soluble complexes, and particles) in a variety of surface and near-surface environments (e.g., waters, soils, and sediments) and show strong mutual interactions. The redox cycling of Fe and Mn functions as a \u201cpump\u201d for element cycling and energy flow, assuring the significant roles of Fe and Mn species in environmental system dynamics. Specifically, an increasing number of studies have found that the coupled redox between Fe and Mn can bilaterally affect the crystallization and transformation of the (oxyhydr)oxides of Fe and Mn (i.e., FeOx and MnOx), which are among the most consequential nanominerals and mineral nanoparticles in these environments. In this review, we map the complex reaction networks between Fe and Mn by discussing the reaction characteristics and mechanisms of each coupled system with various co-existing Fe and Mn species (i.e., FeOx-Mn(II), MnOx-Fe(II), and Fe(II)-Mn(II) systems). Due to the higher redox potentials of MnOx\/Mn(II) compared to those of FeOx\/Fe(II), MnOx can trigger the oxidation of Fe(II) through direct electron transfer, with MnOx undergoing reductive dissolution; while in the FeOx-Mn(II) system, where direct redox reaction between FeOx and Mn(II) is thermodynamically unfavorable, surface-catalyzed oxidation of Mn(II) can be induced by FeOx. In the Fe(II)-Mn(II) system, these species can experience complex homo-and heterogeneous oxidation and crystallization in aerobic environments. The coupled redox cycling of Fe and Mn, which involves crystallization of FeOx and MnOx, dissolution of MnOx substrates, production of reactive oxidants, and the blockage of reactive surfaces of substrates, etc., can exert more complex and significant influences on the biogeochemical processes as compared to individual Fe or Mn.\n               ","47":"\n                  The Triassic\u2013Jurassic transition, which is here broadly defined as extending from the Late Triassic through the Early Jurassic (~237 Ma to 174 Ma), was an important interval in Earth history. The end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME), at ~201 Ma, ranks among the \u2018Big Five\u2019 Phanerozoic mass extinctions. It largely completed the shift from the \u2018Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna\u2019 to the \u2018Modern Evolutionary Fauna\u2019 that had been initiated by the end-Permian mass extinction, and may have contributed to the \u2018Mesozoic Marine Revolution\u2019 and rise of dinosaurs to dominance in terrestrial environments. In addition, the Triassic\u2013Jurassic transition encompasses a second-order mass extinction during the early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE), at ~181 Ma. The ETME was triggered by Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) magmatism, and the T-OAE by Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province (KFLIP) magmatism, both associated with the stepwise disintegration of the Pangean supercontinent. These events led to major changes in continental and marine habitats, including climatic warming, ocean acidification, and widespread watermass anoxia, that produced a cascade of lethal environmental stresses.

The Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield ecozones of northwestern Canada have experienced rapid and widespread permafrost thaw over recent decades, creating significant community concerns and knowledge gaps. In direct response, this review: (1) outlines the observed thaw-induced changes in landcover, hydrology, and water quality; (2) discusses the underlying drivers and mechanisms of these changes; and (3) identifies knowledge gaps to guide future research in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Taiga Plains and Shield (study region). In the Taiga Plains, permafrost is mainly associated with peatlands where its thaw increases the extent of thermokarst wetlands at the expense of treed peatlands underlain by permafrost. This thaw-induced landcover change enhances the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape, which increases basin-scale runoff and annual streamflow, and enables wetland drainage such that permafrost-free treed wetlands develop. Thaw-induced landcover changes in the lake- and bedrock-dominated Taiga Shield are not well known but are expected to occur as limited or minor thermokarst pond development and changing lake extent due to the low (<5%) peatland coverage of this ecozone. Permafrost thaw also increases the connectivity between surface water and groundwater, leading to increasing winter baseflows and possibly icing (aufeis) development. Such increases in hydrologic connectivity can enhance the mobilization of parameters of concern for water quality, both in the Taiga Plains and Shield. The thawing of peatlands will likely increase the transport and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and metals bound to organic compounds, including methylmercury. Further work is needed to fully understand the biogeochemical processes operating in these systems and the degree to which thawing peatlands will impact water quality and quantity at the larger basin scale. The greatest knowledge gaps across the study region surround the evolution of thaw-activated groundwater flow systems and the consequences for wetland biogeochemistry, the rates and patterns of permafrost thaw, contaminant transport, and streamflow of larger river systems. This synthesis not only informs future research directions in the study region but extends to similar subarctic peatland and Shield environments common throughout the circumpolar north.\n               ","49":"\n                  Accumulated records of organic microfossils span billions of years of Earth history. The majority of this record consists of prokaryotes plus eukaryotes of a protistan grade, yet this type of fossilisation is also capable of capturing the organically preserved remains of animals. Recently, it has become apparent that non-biomineralizing animal groups, otherwise known only from rare instances of exceptional fossilisation, can preserve in this fashion. Given this high taphonomic fidelity combined with the temporal continuity of organic microfossil preservation, it is clear this style of fossilisation has the potential to circumvent some of the major biases that afflict the current early animal fossil record. Despite this, there have been no attempts to survey recorded instances of animal-derived organic microfossils. We constructed a global database comprising 394 studies of organic microfossils covering 399 sedimentary rock formations spanning the Tonian\u2013Cambrian Stage 5\/Wuliuan Stage (1\u00a0Ga to 505\u00a0Ma). The database consolidates scattered reports and provides a first appraisal for how a record of metazoans emerges within the broader archives of organic microfossils. Scrutiny of the current record reveals that organic microfossils contain the oldest body fossil evidence for a number of key metazoan clades, including the Chaetognatha, Annelida, Priapulida, \u2018lobopods\u2019 and Panarthropoda, Crustacea, Pterobranchia, and potentially even the Bilateria. Also detected among this record are the fossilised remains of poriferans, chancelloriids, palaeoscolecids, loriciferans, bradoriids, trilobites, wiwaxiids, molluscs, hyoliths, brachiopods and chordates. Our data shows that metazoan-derived remains are relatively common constituents of palynological preparations from sediments of a Cambrian age or younger. Such metazoan remains are also detected in organic microfossil assemblages from several formations of late Ediacaran age, but are entirely absent from the large number of equivalent preparations from older sediments, throughout the Proterozoic. In this view, signs of animal diversification emerge as a unidirectional signal embedded within a deeper record of organic microfossils. We argue here that the absence of animal remains among the large number of equivalent studies from Tonian, Cryogenian and early Ediacaran strata weakens the case for the existence of a cryptic animal biosphere during the Tonian and Cryogenian.\n               ","50":"\n                  A carbonate slope links platform and basin-floor regions holding crucial information on the carbonate source-sink system of a vast ocean.

Based on a comprehensive literature review on carbonate slope failures, a three-segment carbonate slope depositional model was conceptualized and simulated using a stratigraphic forward modelling (SFM) program. The model is capable of simulating carbonate slope failures in a) subaerial, b) shallow marine, and c) deep marine settings concurrently. The SFM program was employed to simulate the evolution of carbonate slope and the occurrence and distribution of mass transport deposits (MTDs) in a deeply buried upper Ediacaran carbonate succession in the central Sichuan Basin, China. The simulation results show that MTDs were mainly developed at the toe-of-slopes and in the center of the Ediacaran trough, offering a new potential play for future hydrocarbon exploration in the area. Several key factors controlling carbonate slope failures, including carbonate lithologies, carbonate growth rates, and frequencies and amplitudes of sea-level fluctuations, were quantitatively evaluated in both time and space domains. Simulations have confirmed that carbonate lithologies can notably affect the frequency and magnitude of slope failures and the development of MTDs, indicating that the higher the proportions of coarser and cemented sediments, the less frequent slope failures and the less the volume of the MTDs would be. The frequency of slope failures and the volume of the MTDs would increase with carbonate growth rates. Slope failures are more likely to be triggered by high-frequency sea-level fluctuations than by low-frequency sea-level changes. For a given sea-level change frequency, the magnitude of a single slope failure event and the total volume of associated MTDs are more likely to be more significant under a greenhouse climate, with a relatively smaller amplitude of sea-level changes, than under an icehouse climate.\n               ","51":"\n                  For a variety of reasons, Madagascar's rich and highly distinctive faunal assemblage has long attracted attention. Recurring questions with the associated studies have concerned when and how the ancestors of the various clades reached the island. For the land-bound animals, the common view is that they arrived after the Cretaceous on \u2018rafts' that washed in from Africa. However, this centuries-old discussion has been periodically spiked with proposals for land-bridges, with a recent one arguing for three separate causeways or stepping-stone chains connecting Africa and Madagascar in the early, middle, and late Cenozoic (66\u201360\u00a0Ma, 36\u201330\u00a0Ma, and 12\u20135\u00a0Ma). Here, the general idea of former causeways spanning the Mozambique Channel is evaluated based on an extensive survey of the related geological and geophysical literature, a large portion of which dates from the last half-decade. The analysis, which makes use of a newly-developed topological schema, indicates that only a small number of the supposed dry-land sub-paths were actually subaerial during each of the postulated colonization windows. Notably, during the Early Oligocene, a 220\u2013250\u00a0km2 pinnacle in the Sakalaves Seamount group formed a volcanic \u2018high-island\u2019. The other offshore sectors that were exposed would have been atoll crowns: Juan de Nova Island throughout the Cenozoic and the northern Sakalaves in the Late Miocene. However, it would have been challenging for most land animals to exist on those low-elevation carbonate platforms for any length of time. Therefore, the notion of Africa and Madagascar being linked in the Cenozoic by terrestrial walkways can be regarded as falsified. Over-water dispersal best explains how 26 of Madagascar's 27 land-vertebrate clades colonized the landmass. The exception, a group of small, soil-dwelling snakes, is likely a relict lineage whose ancestors were present on the island prior to Madagascar's geographical isolation that resulted from the tectonic block's breakup with India-Seychelles c. 85\u00a0Ma.\n               ","52":"\n                  Replacing coal with cleaner hydrocarbon resources is a viable solution to reach carbon neutrality goals over time, especially given the current lack of growth in green energy resources (e.g., hydro, solar, wind, geothermal) globally. Hydrocarbon resources offer a low-carbon, low-waste, large-scale, rapid solution. Dynamic continuous hydrocarbon accumulation (DCHA) exists widely in sandstone and shale reservoirs and has enormous resource potential. However, understanding the accumulation mechanisms and models of DCHAs in different structural locations is highly challenging. In this study, we first extensively review hydrocarbon resources derived from hydrocarbon accumulation and identify key scientific issues and theories. We then take the well-known typical DCHA in the Bohai Bay Basin in eastern China as a case, and combine multiple analytical methods, such as biomarker analysis, petroleum and aqueous inclusion analysis, quantitative fluorescence analysis, microscopic thin section observations, and basin modeling, to investigate petroleum sources, charging times, and charging forces. The results of our study show that the DCHA is a superimposed accumulation of multiple petroleum reservoir types with multiple petroleum sources, charging times, charging forces, and modes. Petroleum reservoirs at high structural locations are conventional trap reservoirs accumulated by buoyancy in the early stage, with long migration distances. Petroleum reservoirs at the sag location are deep unconventional petroleum reservoirs accumulated by the petroleum generation pressurization force in the middle stage, with short migration distances. Petroleum reservoirs at the slope location are superpositions of conventional traps and deep unconventional petroleum reservoirs in the middle and late stages, with moderate migration distances.\n               ","53":"\n                  The origin and evolution of land plants in the Ordovician and Carboniferous reshaped the terrestrial environment, marine ecology, and atmospheric composition, ultimately triggering global climate change. Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient for plants and can only be obtained from pedogenic weathering of bedrock (including rocks and deposits). In the Ordovician and Carboniferous, periodic and frequent volcanic eruptions at convergent plate margins formed the bedrock that elevated P supply for the terrestrial biosphere. Temporal variation of P availability reveals that volcanic P supply spiked at 474\u2013465\u00a0Ma, 454\u2013445\u00a0Ma, and 319\u2013310\u00a0Ma, with the assembly of Gondwana and Pangaea supercontinents. The abundant P supported the crucial Phanerozoic ecological transitions marked by the episodically increased land plant biomass and emergence of non-vascular, vascular, and seed plants. The volcanism-driven evolution and expansion of land plants further accelerated rock weathering and enhanced organic carbon burial. This positive feedback eventually resulted in the ice ages in the Paleozoic. Therefore, the variation of P availability, dependent on the scale and P content of volcanic products, was strongly associated with the plate subduction during supercontinent assembly, revealing the significant impact of tectonism on terrestrial ecosystems.\n               ","54":"\n                  During the mid-Palaeozoic, vascular land plants (i.e., tracheophytes) underwent a great radiation that triggered the development of the land biosphere \u2013 the so-called Silurian\u2013Devonian terrestrial revolution. However, little is known about how different plant groups impacted this process. A newly constructed dataset of plant macrofossil genera is used to characterize the tempo and mode of development of Silurian\u2013Devonian vegetation and how it spread out over subaerial habitats. Important fluctuations of diversity and evolutionary rates of vegetation are linked to the diversity dynamics of particular tracheophyte groups. Despite a general increase of taxonomic richness through the Devonian, there was a clear stepwise pattern of origination and extinction events that resulted in the main floral transitions over time, such as the change to a forested landscape. To test if sampling bias may be affecting the observed diversity patterns, the latter were compared with the number of plant macrofossil localities as a proxy for sampling effort. This suggested a highly significant correlation between observed diversity and sampling effort, but it was not homogeneous, suggesting that at least some diversity fluctuations have a potential biological explanation. The sampling-corrected pattern of standing diversity suggests a clear increase of plant richness in the Pragian (Early Devonian) and Givetian (Middle Devonian), which may be related to the early expansion of the tracheophyte clades and the initial diversification of forested ecosystems, respectively. Further works should be focused on elucidate the impact of rock record on our understanding of Devonian plant diversification.\n               ","55":"\n                  We found the study of Majhi et al.

According to the authors, practically every study of the 100 research examined either overestimated or underestimated at least one of the five factors. We appreciate the excellent work of Majhi et al. (2021). Their research demonstrating the flaws in previous studies that employed USLE-based models to estimate soil erosion is precisely the type of work we need. However, we fear that Majhi et al.

The New Siberian Islands (NSI) archipelago is one of the few territories accessible for direct geologic study in this region. The De Long Islands occupy the northernmost part of the NSI archipelago and are situated at the junction of the major tectonic units of the Eastern Arctic. This, coupled with the lack of geologic information caused by the remoteness of the islands, leads to many debates concerning the tectonic affinity and relations of the De Long Islands with adjacent units. Here we review the geology and paleomagnetism for Cambrian\u2013Ordovician rocks of the De Long Islands. The similarity of benthic fauna groups of the De Long and adjacent Anjou basins to the Siberian Taimyr-Verkhoyansk margin indicates that the De Long unit was close to Siberia. However, some detrital zircon groups indicate their non-Siberia provenances. In this review, based on paleomagnetic evidence, we propose a global tectonic reconstruction showing interactions and drift kinematics of the NSI and the nearby Arctic terranes as well as the cratons Siberia, Laurentia and Baltica from 510 to 450\u00a0Ma. We propose the existence of a New Siberian \u2013 Chukotka \u2013 Alaska carbonate platform \u2013 a large epicontinental basin between Siberia and Laurentia with a biogeographic connection to the Verkhoyansk shelf of Siberia and potential detrital provenances from Chukotka \u2013 Alaska.

As the initial stage of the \u2018Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event\u2019, the \u2018Ordovician Plankton Revolution\u2019 played a crucial role in the increase of biodiversity in the Ordovician. The occurrence, phylogeny, diversity and abundance of caryocaridids, an important and representative group of planktonic arthropods in the Ordovician, may provide important information for studying the \u2018Ordovician Plankton Revolution\u2019 and the evolution of pelagic food webs. Based on systematic collection of paleontological data of caryocaridids, combined with phylogenetic methods, we determined the taxonomic position of caryocaridids, discussed the evolutionary path of the group, reconstructed the biological migration process of caryocaridids and its paleoecological and paleogeographical setting. Our results show that caryocaridids were a clade of planktonic arthropods, which are commonly preserved in black shales along with graptolites and pelagic trilobites. The caryocaridids evolved from the late Cambrian phyllocarids. They first appeared in the Tremadocian, rapidly diversified in the Floian to Darriwilian, then declined in the Late Ordovician, and went extinct at the end of the Ordovician. From the late Cambrian to the Early Ordovician, a large number of marine organisms switched to the planktonic mode. The emergence, rise and diversification of planktonic caryocaridids provide new evidence for the diversity of marine plankton, the complexity of the Ordovician pelagic food webs, and the occurrence of the \u2018Ordovician Plankton Revolution\u2019.\n               ","59":"\n                  The complex interactions between biocrust properties and rainfall characteristics give rise to partitioning of infiltration and runoff. In this review we examine primary mechanisms for runoff generation due to water repellency (WR), pore clogging (PC), soil texture and structural features including surface roughness. The primary hypothesis is that while WR plays an important role in runoff generation in humid regions, PC is a dominant process for runoff in arid and semiarid regions even under moderate rainfall intensities. Evidence suggests that the amount and properties of biocrust extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dictate the rheological properties and swelling characteristics of the biocrust, which, in turn, govern the degree of pore clogging (due to surface swelling) and the resulting surface saturation. Changes in species composition of the main photoautotrophic component of the biocrust control the amount and properties of the embedded EPS. Disturbance or warmer climate may affect runoff generation via changes in biocrust species composition. These changes may not be necessarily long-lived when the disturbance is ceased or climate conditions revert to \u2018original\u2019 long term state.\n               ","60":"\n                  We investigate kinematic evolutionary paths of seventeen major shear zones associated with internal thrust faults from the Himalayan, Appalachian, Caledonian, Zagros, Alpine, and Sevier fold-thrust belt (FTB), by assessing published minimum strain, kinematic vorticity number, and minimum translation. We estimate the pure shear component from the recorded vorticity and reconstruct a first-order kinematic path based on multiple strain markers, wherever possible. The studied shear zones follow decelerating strain paths. In general, sub- simple shear more effectively accumulates translation than pure\/simple shear deformation. Shear zones with relatively high pure shear component record higher strain. Incremental strain markers from these shear zones record a progressive evolution from an earlier simple shear dominated to a pure shear dominated flow. These results are in agreement with earlier theoretical studies.\n                  Internal shear zones that act as roof thrusts of duplexes or have stacked imbricate structures in their immediate footwall, generally record relatively higher strain, greater translation and greater pure shear component toward the later stage than similar shear zones without such footwall structures. We interpret that slip-transfer and structural culmination formed during growth of immediate footwall structures contribute to the kinematic evolution of internal shear zones. The same shear zone records along-strike variation in its kinematic path as a result of its varying immediate footwall geometry. Thus, deciphering comprehensive kinematic evolutionary paths of internal shear zones also requires understanding of immediate footwall structures. Additionally, studying kinematic paths of internal shear zones may provide insights into the geometry of immediate footwall structures when they are not exposed.\n               ","61":"","62":"\n                  A full review of the 79 CE Plinian eruption of Vesuvius is presented through a multidisciplinary approach, exploiting the integration of historical, stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrological, geophysical, paleoclimatic, and modelling studies dedicated to this famous and devastating natural event. All studies have critically been reviewed and integrated with original data, spanning from proximal to ultradistal findings of the 79 CE eruption products throughout the Mediterranean. The work not only combines different investigation approaches (stratigraphic, petrological, geophysical, modelling), but also follows temporally the 79 CE eruptive and depositional events, from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. This has allowed us first to compile a full database of all findings of those deposits, then to relate the products (the deposits) to the genetic thermomechanical processes (the eruption), and lastly to better assess both the local and regional impacts of the 79 CE eruption in the environment. This information leads to a number of open issues (e.g., regional environmental impact vs. local pyroclastic current impact) that are worthy of further investigations, although the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius is one of the best studied eruptions in volcanology. The structure of the work follows three macro-categories, the historical aspects, the products, and the processes of the 79 CE eruption. For each investigation approach (from stratigraphy to modelling), all dedicated studies and original data are discussed. The open issues are then synthesized in the discussion under a global view of Plinian eruptions, from the magma setting to its dispersion as pyroclasts flowing on the surface vs. falling from the volcanic plume. In this way, a lesson from the past, in particular from the well-studied 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, will be of help for a better synchronization of processes and products in future developments. Lastly, various aspects for volcanic hazard assessment of Plinian eruptions are highlighted from the tephra distribution and modelling points of view, as these large natural phenomena can have a larger impact than previously thought, also at other active volcanoes.\n               ","63":"\n                  The early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE, ~183\u00a0Ma), also known as the Jenkyns Event, was one of the most important hyperthermal events of the Phanerozoic, caused by the large-scale release of carbon from massive volcanism and\/or surficial carbon reservoirs. Organic-rich facies record the event in basins worldwide, but the precise controls on organic carbon burial, and the relative importance of this burial as a mechanism of sequestering excess carbon from the Toarcian atmosphere, are uncertain. In this study, we have compiled total organic carbon (TOC) data from 67 lower Toarcian sections to reconstruct the pattern of organic enrichment through the T-OAE. Shallow marine sites dominate the compilation, and rates of organic carbon burial during the T-OAE were low relative to shallow water margins at the present day. Redox was a major control on organic enrichment and burial rates, but the very high TOC (>5%) observed in hydrographically restricted anoxic-euxinic basins in northern Europe and elsewhere were largely a consequence of low sedimentation rates. Globally, organic enrichment and redox conditions were highly variable, but a majority of sites show an increase in TOC at the T-OAE relative to pre-event values. TOC increases were generally highest where deoxygenation was most severe. In anoxic-euxinic marine basins in Europe organic carbon burial rates may have increased ~500% on average during the T-OAE, potentially sequestering an extra ~791 Gt of carbon relative to the same time period immediately prior to the event. Sites outside of Europe and those that remained oxic-suboxic or were dominated by terrestrial organic matter show variable, and often negligible, changes in organic enrichment across the T-OAE. Globally, an extra ~9000 Gt of carbon may have been buried in shallow seas during the T-OAE relative to before the event. Nevertheless, a paucity of data and significant uncertainties mean that the precise amount of excess carbon sequestered during the T-OAE remains uncertain.\n               ","64":"\n                  We here review in terms of tectono-magmatic setting and Quaternary landscape dynamics what is known about the provenance of Argentine dune fields and their fluvial feeder systems draining the Andean Cordillera. The detrital signatures of these eolian sediments were previously investigated based on either framework petrography and heavy minerals or detrital-zircon geochronology, and their peculiar volcaniclastic nature was long recognized. Compositional variability, however, was only broadly evaluated, and quantitative provenance analysis based on a systematic multimethod approach across the entire region was not carried out so far. For this reason, here we integrate original and previously obtained petrographic, heavy-mineral, and detrital-zircon geochronology data to present the first comprehensive provenance study of dune fields stretching for 1000 km across central Argentina from the Andean piedmont to the Atlantic Ocean.\n                  In dune fields along the Andean retroarc basin, sediment composition defines a steady northward decrease in volcanic detritus. This reflects active magmatism in the Southern Volcanic Zone and Payenia province (38\u00b0-34\u00b0S), in contrast with the ~600-km-long Pliocene-Quaternary magmatic gap in the Pampean flat-slab segment (33\u00b0-27\u00b0S), where sediment is derived from deeper-seated tectono-stratigraphic levels of the continental arc and uplifted blocks of retroarc-basin basement. In distal Pampean lowlands extending across the bulge and backbulge depozones, instead, sand dunes display notably homogeneous compositional signatures, indicating that detritus was mostly generated north of 34\u00b0S and transported by a paleo-Desaguadero trunk river that formed during southward-progressing diachronous uplift of the Sierras Pampeanas since the late Miocene. In contrast with huge African and Arabian deserts that contain multiply recycled quartzose to pure quartzose sand, even very fragile volcanic clasts, plagioclase feldspar, and unstable ferromagnesian minerals are widespread, testifying to largely first-cycle volcanic provenance and only minor effects of mechanical breakdown and chemical weathering in the Pampean Sand Sea.\n                  During the Late Pleistocene, after a first southward shift of the Desaguadero trunk river possibly induced by increased water and sediment discharge at the end of the penultimate glacial maximum, tectonic uplift eventually outpaced stream power during the last glacial period. Paleo-rivers were thus forced to shift farther southwards, leading to the formation of an integrated paleo-Desaguadero+Colorado drainage system. During the latest Pleistocene-early Holocene, such a large trunk river fostered the rapid progradation of a wide delta and littoral sand transport all along the shores of the Buenos Aires Province. Climate change and repeated waxing and waning of glaciers through the Quaternary have left a prominent mark on sediment distribution, dominated by fluvial processes during periods of high fluvial discharge but alternating with arid phases characterized by limited transport capacity and vegetation cover, extensive wind deflation of floodplains, and sand accumulation in the dune fields.\n               ","65":"\n                  Rills caused by runoff concentration on erodible hillslopes generally have very irregular longitudinal profiles and cross-section shapes.

At first, in this paper, a review of the two different approaches to estimate rill flow velocity, based on flow regime and flow resistance laws, is presented.\n                  Recent advances in measurements of rill geometry by the three-dimensional photo-reconstruction (3D-PR) technique, which allows one to obtain a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) by low-altitude aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, are also discussed.

In particular, the review was developed considering the studies conducted investigating the different components of rill flow resistance due to grain resistance, morphological resistance (step-pool), and sediment transport. Moreover, a brief mention of the slope threshold, equal to 18%, determining differences in hydraulic and sediment transport variables, is done.\n                  Also, an analysis is developed to demonstrate that a theoretical rill flow resistance law has been erroneously presented as an example of spurious correlation.\n                  Finally, some research needs on rill flow hydraulics are highlighted.\n               ","66":"\n                  Proxy records from across the Southern Hemisphere show significant local to regional scale variability in climatic and environmental conditions during late Marine Isotope Stage 3 and early Marine Isotope Stage 2, prior to the global last glacial maximum (LGM; 26.5\u201319.0 kyr). Although not necessarily synchronous across the hemisphere, the regional signature of these pre-26.5 kyr \u2018events\u2019 suggests greater complexity of events preceding the global LGM in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. Here we explore climatic and environmental variability across the Southern Hemisphere during two time-slices: 32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 kyr (representing the period of Southern Hemisphere summer insolation minimum) and 21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 kyr (representing the period of maximum global ice volume), based on previously published palaeoclimate proxy data.

Furthermore, the descent into minimum temperatures occurred later in Antarctica than elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Effective precipitation was more variable, with evidence for both increased and decreased moisture availability across the hemisphere during each time slice. The pattern of effective precipitation indicates that local factors likely played a more significant role in driving moisture availability compared to temperature.

Although there is general agreement about the regional scale geology of Taiwan, there are considerable differences in the structural interpretations of its western fold-and-thrust belt. In this paper, we bring together results of our previous studies and add new data and data analyses to develop a consistent 3D structural model for the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt that can explain key aspects of the seismicity, GPS, and topography data. We interpret the fold-and-thrust belt to be a west-verging, imbricate thrust system developed above a single basal thrust that is breached by ENE-striking faults that are inherited from the continental margin. These breaching faults are associated with ENE-striking transverse zones in the fold-and-thrust belt that are marked by changes in stratigraphy, structural style, strike and dip of the basal thrust, and uplift of the stratigraphic contacts. Along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt, metamorphic basement rocks are involved in the thrusting. Shortening estimates range from 15\u00a0km to >25\u00a0km. Much of the seismicity is taking place beneath the basal thrust, in the basement, along the flanks of basement highs and lows where strike-slip and transpressive fault types are common. There are systematic changes in GPS displacement vectors and strain rates across the transverse zones. Topography is higher in areas where basement is involved in the thrusting. The proposed structural model has depth and along-strike consistency, and can explain aspects of the distribution of seismicity, faults types, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, and topography of the study area, and can therefore be considered a viable model.\n               ","68":"\n                  The paleoelevation history and geodynamic evolution of the Bangong suture zone in the central Tibetan Plateau are hotly debated, with existing estimates showing contrasting results.

We use this understanding to further explore the paleoelevation of the Lunpola Basin along the Bangong suture.

The new calculations indicate that the precipitation-weighted mean elevation of the Lunpola Basin catchment was likely at 4.2\u20134.9\u00a0km during the early Miocene. We use these results and a review of existing paleoelevation studies to propose a three-stage topographic growth model for Central Tibet.

(2022) use the Fe isotope and trace-element compositions of ~3.5 Ga jaspilites from the North Pole Dome area of the Pilbara Craton, northwestern Australia, to investigate links between the ancient Fe biogeochemical cycle, continental exposure and nutrient (P) availability. The geochemical arguments are based on the underlying assumption that the jaspilites contain primary hematite that was initially deposited as Si-ferrihydrite precipitates following Fe(II)(aq) oxidation by photoferrotrophs. In support of a primary origin for the iron oxide, the authors present observations from standard light petrography showing the presence of fine-grained hematite dispersed amongst the chert. Here, we question whether the fine-grained hematite is the sole iron precipitate, and indeed, whether it is primary. These concerns arise from work on nearby and slightly younger jaspilites (3.46 Ga Marble Bar Chert Member), in which SEM and TEM studies revealed the presence of fine-grained particles (typically <1 \u00b5m) of greenalite and siderite, as well as evidence for pervasive secondary oxidation. Although fine-grained hematite is readily identified using light microscopy, tiny Fe(II)-rich particles can easily be overlooked. For this reason, we believe that the Dresser jaspilites, which closely resemble the nearby Marble Bar jaspilites, may also contain Fe(II)-rich precipitates. In addition, given the widespread evidence for secondary oxidation in the Marble Bar jaspilites, there remains a distinct possibility that the fine-grained hematite in the Dresser jaspilites is not primary. The precipitation of Fe(II)-rich phases, rather than ferrihydrite, would undermine interpretations for Fe biogeochemical cycling centred on photoferrotrophy.

The Subei-South Yellow Sea Basin (SB-SYSB) is located at the junction of different blocks and tectonic zones, including the North China Block (NCB), South China Block (SCB), Sulu Orogen and Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ). Therefore, the basin is a key location for understanding the regional geologic evolution of East China. Here, we present the geometry and kinematics of opposite thrust systems (OTSs) under the SB-SYSB based on seismic profiles, well data, magnetic reversion data and field observations. The OTSs are composed of two sets of thrust systems with opposite senses of motion: the northern top-to-the-southeast thrust system (N-TS) and southern top-to-the-northwest thrust system (S-TS). According to the structural styles, the N-TS and S-TS can be divided into the root, middle and frontal belts. The strikes of thrusts show a shift from NNE to NE- ENE and then to nearly E-W from west to east. The OTSs were suggested to have formed during the end of the middle Triassic to the middle Jurassic, and its deformation intensity decreased from west to east and from the root belt to the frontal belt. Combining these lines of evidence with published geochronological data for the Dabie-Sulu Orogen and other structural elements in East China, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and propose a new tectonic model to explain the early Mesozoic geodynamic and tectonic relations in East China. We emphasize the following points: (1) The Sulu Orogen might extend to the Northern Depression in the offshore SYSB and be bounded by the North Fault of the Central Massif to the south, indicating that the Sulu Orogen is significantly wider than stated in previous studies. (2) The N-TS was driven by the subduction of the YZB and the exhumation of the Sulu HP\u2013UHP metamorphic rocks. In contrast, the S-TS was probably controlled by the orogenic uplift of the Jiangnan Orogen. (3) The dragging of the thrusts in the SB-SYSB and adjacent areas indicates that the sinistral motion of the TLFZ was coeval with the formation of the OTSs and was likely caused by the clockwise rotation of the SCB. (4) Finally, this clockwise rotation probably triggered intense corner compression between the Sulu Orogen, TLFZ and East Marginal Fault of the Yellow Sea, resulting in a genetic relation among the Sulu Orogen, the SCB, the Korean Peninsula and the Xu-Huai Belt.\n               ","71":"\n                  Rifted continental margins (RCM) are large-scale features of Earth's surface that show substantial morphological variations. Classical escarpment features are the subject of many studies in these settings while other morphologies that characterize this tectonic environment receive less attention. The case of the Brazilian South Atlantic margin, a continental-scale topographically pronounced terrain covering >1000\u00a0km of the western South Atlantic rifted margin, is not an exception. Most landscape evolution studies concentrate on the Serra do Mar escarpment system, while other segments with no escarpments have received less attention. Various authors assume the Brazilian elevated continental margin as a well-defined and continuous marginal upwarp instead of a diversified and more complex landscape. Here we debate this issue and explore how the first-order topographic forms and time-space denudation patterns differ along the Brazilian South Atlantic margin. We focus on the continental margin of southeast Brazil (CMSEB) that includes a southern segment featured by a prominent escarpment system and a northern segment where the seaward-facing steep escarpment is absent. We show that, similar to other RCMs, the CMSEB presents a continental drainage divide separating two distinct regions with contrasting denudation patterns, (i) an inland continental interior, characterized by high elevation and relatively low relief with a predominance of apatite fission track (AFT) ages significantly older than South Atlantic rifting event, and (ii) a coastal region characterized by low elevations and high relief with the predominance AFT ages younger than the rifting. However, besides the differential denudation associated with the South Atlantic opening, the margin has experienced substantial post-rift exhumation attributed to rock uplift triggered by the reactivation of inherited basement structures. The morphological differences between CMSEB's southern and northern extensions reflect sectors with contrasting geomorphic evolution supporting the idea that the rifted Brazilian RCM is not a single and continuous tectonic setting. Finally, our findings indicate that tectonic inheritance strongly impacts the denudation pattern, which contributes to the geomorphic diversification along the Brazilian RCM.\n               ","72":"\n                  Many continental rifts are subjected to volcanism in tandem with rifting, which has raised a long-standing debate about whether magmatism is the cause or the consequence of plate fragmentation. To re-evaluate this chicken-and-egg question, we took advantage of five decades of research on the East African Rift System (EARS), the largest active continental rift on Earth, to explore the spatial and temporal relationship between rifting and magmatism. By comparing the co-occurrence of tectonics and volcanism since the Eocene with the present-day seismicity, we delimit the EARS as a\u00a0~\u00a05000\u00a0km-wide zone of volcano-tectonics made of four branches affecting not only East Africa but also the Mozambique channel and Madagascar. We then developed a quality filtering procedure of published radiometric ages in order to build two independent, robust, and comprehensive age compilations for magmatism and rifting over this extended EARS. Our thorough quality-checked selection of ages reveals that the EARS presents two distinct regimes of volcanism. Since the Upper Eocene, the rift system was affected by (1) pulses of volcanism in 500\u20131000\u00a0km-wide areas, and (2) a discontinuous but remarkably simultaneous volcanic activity, scattered along the four branches of the EARS since 25\u201327\u00a0Ma. Combining this spatio-temporal evolution of volcanism with a critical review of the timing of rifting, we show that the tectonics of the EARS evolves through time from trap-scale to plate-scale rifting. Until the Middle Miocene, extension structures first developed following flood basalt events and plateau uplifts. Then, volcanism resumed synchronously all over the EARS at ca. 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma, followed by a general extensional deformation. This evolution, which cannot be explained by the sole action of a plume or of tectonics, is therefore interpreted in an intermediate way in which the EARS results from (1) extensive stresses acting on the African lithosphere in the long-lived context of the Gondwana breakup and (2) an overall complex mantle upwelling dynamics arising from the African Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP). We propose that extension stresses affecting the African lithosphere also modulate the melting of mantle anomalies and\/or the collection of magma through the Pan-African belts. This influence explains the synchronous occurrence of many magmatic and tectonic events in the EARS and at the boundaries of the Nubia and Somali plates. Finally, our results suggest that the source of extension stresses affecting the African plate probably evolved from a dominant far-field origin to prevailing variations of gravitational potential energy (GPE) and a diverging basal shear of the Nubia and Somali lithosphere. This change would stem from an increase of the mantle flux in the Middle Miocene, yielding a change in the EARS\u2019 dynamics from trap-scale to plate scale rifting.\n               ","73":"\n                  The Precambrian Singhbhum Craton and the adjoining orogenic belts of eastern India hold a history of continental crust generation by repeated emplacement and reworking of multiphase tonalite-trondjhemite-granodiorite (TTG) and granites throughout the Archean. Temporal classification of this complex Archean TTG and granite sequence have not been straightforward due to repeated magmatism that gave rise to complex intrusive relationships between the magmatic bodies, their complex tectonic juxtaposition and lack of geochronological data. Recent surge of new geochronological and isotope data has brought significantl clarity in the temporal relationships between different crustal components of this craton. In this study, geochemical data (published and new) of the TTG and granites (n\u00a0=\u00a0251) with robust age reference was compiled and classified using a two-fold (viz. age and geochemistry) classification to understand the secular change of crustal composition. Herein, the Archean TTG suites were divided into four age-based groups, viz. Group-I (> ca. 3.5\u20133.4\u00a0Ga), II (ca. 3.4\u20133.3\u00a0Ga), III (ca. 3.3\u20133.2\u00a0Ga) and IV (<ca. 3.2\u00a0Ga). This reveals relative abundance of TTG and granite components vary systematically from one temporal group to another. Time defined locally weighted, non-linear regression trends show that the composition of Singhbhum continental crust experienced a transition at ca. 3.4\u00a0Ga, before which low-Mg#, sodic TTG prevailed. After ca. 3.4\u00a0Ga, the crust was gradually replaced by more potassic, transitional TTG and granites. TTG to granite transition in this craton took place at ca. 3.3\u00a0Ga after which proportion of granites spiked significantly. Finally from ca. 3.2\u00a0Ga, more evolved, potassic granites started emerging throughout the craton. Prevalence of low-Mg# TTGs indicates that subduction may not have played a significant role in generating the TTGs. Dominance of potassic granitoids confirm that crustal reworking became a dominant process as early as the Paleoarchean. Prevalence of peraluminous granites after ca. 3.4\u00a0Ga indicates that the Singhbhum cratonic crust matured very early in the Earth's history.\n               ","74":"\n                  Several past attempts to model the variation in atmospheric oxygen through the Paleozoic give generally conflicting results, but all agree that pO2 rose to a peak in the late Paleozoic between 320 and 260\u00a0Ma. The Pyrite Proxy, based on the concentrations of Se and Co in sedimentary pyrite, provides an alternative to the modelling approach. Here we reformulate the Pyrite Proxy for the Paleozoic with \u2018best fit\u2019 to measured oxygen levels in fluid inclusion gases in sedimentary halite over the Phanerozoic. The proxy exhibits systematic variations in pO2 through the Silurian to Carboniferous period that are shown to closely correlate with evolutionary changes in the biosphere. In particular the proxy demonstrates how oxygen levels increased through the Silurian and early Devonian along with the development of vascular plants, the first hexapods and giant fish, followed by a sharp decline through the late Devonian coinciding with a period of high frequency magnetic reversals, the hexapod and charcoal gaps and the Devonian mass extinction events. Oxygen rises dramatically in the mid to late Mississippian reaching a peak in the Pennsylvania accompanied by development of tall tropical arborescent lycopsids and a period of giant volant insects. The difference between traditional box models based on O2 (PAL) and the actual composition of gas from halite fluid inclusions and the Pyrite Proxy, in turn, also offers a new and interesting methodology for estimating trends in atmospheric density over time.\n               ","75":"\n                  An extensive dataset of existing and new geo\/thermochronological data from several areas in Southern Mexico constrains the tectonic history of the region, as well as various source-to-sink relationships and local burial histories. Our interpretation acknowledges that not all cooling\/heating observed in the source areas is due to erosional exhumation\/burial but, in some cases, due to advective heat transfer from magmatic sources, which potentially overprinted earlier events. In this work, we identified several areas that have been exhumed since the Early Cretaceous and potentially provided clastic material to the southern Gulf of Mexico area.\n                  We help to document how the Mexican (Laramide) Orogeny propagated eastwards and southwards from the Late Cretaceous through the early Oligocene. The first sediments reaching the Tampico\u2013Misantla and Veracruz basins derived mostly from eroded Cretaceous carbonate material that covered the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez Complex and the Cuicateco belts, as well as foredeep\/intra-orogenic basin deposits formerly covering them. Possibly by the end of the Mexican Orogeny, the clastic Jurassic and older crystalline basement rocks became exposed and became the main sources of quartz-rich clastic material to the most easterly foreland basins and Gulf of Mexico. Exposure was probably assisted by higher angle basement thrusts such as the Vista Hermosa\/Valle Nacional faults. The Mixtequita and Guichicovi blocks have also provided an important source of quartz-rich and metamorphic lithic-rich material to the southern Veracruz Basin possibly since the Eocene.\n                  For most of the Cenozoic, the Chiapas and the Sureste basins were sourced from areas south of the Chiapas Massif, i.e., the North America\u2013Caribbean plate boundary zone along today's Chiapas coastal plain. This plate boundary zone accommodated relative displacement between Mexico and the Chortis Block of the Caribbean Plate. Paleocene\u2013middle Miocene sediments within the Chiapas Basin were at least partially sourced from i) metamorphic complexes in the northern Chortis Block; ii) the parautochthonous Chontal Complex, an oceanic-like basin sandwiched between Chortis and southern Mexico; iii) the elongating volcanic arc along southern Mexico and western Chortis; and iv) the Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary cover of the southern flank of the Chiapas Massif,\n                  The westward telescoping of southern Mexico onto the Cocos Plate in the wake of Chortis has produced flat slab subduction geometry and eastwardly-younging uplift of the Xolapa Belt (Oligo\u2013Miocene) and the Chiapas Massif (late Miocene). It also caused reorganization of the drainage systems providing material to the Chiapas and Sureste basins.\n                  Our results highlight the importance of understanding relative block and plate boundary displacements in a dynamic hinterland and consider the role of major faults when interpreting source-to-sink relationships in the area. We describe the latter relationships for several geologic time intervals in which reservoir-prone sediments were delivered to the southern Gulf of Mexico. Finally, we integrate the source-to-sink history to provide an assessment of reservoir quality and hydrocarbon prospectivity in the region.\n               ","76":"\n                  The mangrove communities of the Caribbean region are considered descendants of former pantropical Late-Cretaceous mangroves that underwent regional differentiation after the tectonic closure of the Tethys Sea. The southern Caribbean area has been considered the cradle of Neotropical mangroves. These inferences were based mainly on qualitative evidence, such as the presence\/absence of fossils showing botanical affinities with present-day mangrove taxa. However, as demonstrated in Quaternary paleoecology, the most suitable approach for reconstructing past plant communities is the assemblage approach, which is based on quantitative palynology. Therefore, the problem of the origin of Caribbean mangroves, as ecological communities, is addressed here by reviewing in detail the Late Cretaceous to Eocene quantitative palynological studies available for the region to properly reconstruct past mangrove assemblages. No evidence has been found for the occurrence of mangrove ecosystems during the Late Cretaceous and the Paleocene, only records of the fossil representatives of some individual taxa (Nypa, Acrostichum), which are not mangrove-forming elements and, hence, are not reliable indicators of mangrove communities. The first robust evidence of true mangrove communities was found in the Middle Eocene (Lutetian). These mangrove communities were dominated by the fossil representative of Pelliciera, a mangrove-forming tree with a Neotropical distribution by that time. Back-mangrove communities were dominated by the palm Nypa (which was pantropical by that time but is now restricted to the Indo-Malayan region), the fern Acrostichum and palms, notably Mauritia, along a sea-land saline to freshwater community gradient. Pelliciera originated in the southern Caribbean during the Early Eocene and became dominant in the Middle Eocene, when it dispersed across the Caribbean area, probably favored by the migration of the Caribbean plate. Therefore, the first Caribbean mangroves were ecological and evolutionary innovations that emerged de novo during the Eocene, rather than a consequence of the regional evolutionary differentiation from hypothetical Late Cretaceous Tethyan mangroves, whose existence is not supported by quantitative palynological records. It is proposed to develop this type of study for other tropical\/subtropical mangrove communities, for a sounder view of mangrove origin and evolution, at a global scale.\n               ","77":"\n                  The Devonian has long been a problematic period for paleomagnetism. Devonian paleomagnetic data are generally difficult to interpret and have complex partial or full overprints\u2013 problems that arise in data obtained from both sedimentary and igneous rocks. As a result, the reconstruction of tectonic plate motions, largely performed using apparent polar wander paths, has large uncertainty. Similarly, the Devonian geomagnetic polarity time scale is very poorly constrained. Paleointensity studies from volcanic units suggest that the field was much weaker than the modern field, and it has been hypothesised that this was accompanied by many polarity reversals (a hyperreversing field). We sampled Middle to Upper Devonian sections in Germany, Poland and Canada which show low conodont alteration indices, implying low thermal maturity. We show that there are significant issues with these data, which are not straightforward to interpret, even though no significant heating or remineralisation appears to have caused overprinting. We compare our data to other magnetostratigraphic studies from the Devonian and review the polarity pattern as presented in the Geologic Time Scale. Combined with estimates for the strength of the magnetic field, we suggest that the field during the Devonian might have been so weak, and in part non-dipolar, that obtaining reliable primary paleomagnetic data from Devonian rocks is challenging. Careful examination of all data, no matter how unusual, is the best way to push forward our understanding of the Devonian magnetic field. Paleointensity studies show that the field during the Devonian had a similar low strength to the Ediacaran. Independent evidence from malformed spores around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary suggests that the terrestrial extinction connected to the Hangenberg event was caused by increased UV-B radiation, supporting the weak field hypothesis. A fundamentally weak and possibly non-dipolar field during the Devonian could have been produced, in part, by true polar wander acting to maximise core-mantle heat flow in the equatorial region. It may also have influenced evolution and extinctions in this time period. There are a large number of paleobiological crises in the Devonian, and we pose the question, did the Earth\u2019s magnetic field influence these crises?\n               ","78":"\n                  Accurate spatial models of tectonic plates and geological terranes are important for analyzing and interpreting a wide variety of geoscientific data and developing compositional and physical models of the lithosphere. We present a global compilation of active plate boundaries and geological provinces in a shapefile format with interpretive attributes (e.g., crust type, plate type, province type, last orogeny). The initial plate and province boundaries are constructed from a combination of published global and regional models that we refine using a variety of geoscientific constraints including, but not limited to, relative GPS motions, earthquakes, mapped faults, potential field characteristics, and geochronology. These new plate model show improved correlation to observed earthquake and volcano occurrences within deformation zones and microplates, compared to existing models, capturing 73 and 80% of these criteria, respectively. Deformation zones and microplates only account for 16% of Earth's surface area. We estimate 57.5% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceanic crust, which is a slight increase relative to the most recent seafloor age model. The model of last orogenies agrees well with peaks in the globally summed geochronology data. There is room for improvement in future editions of our global plate and geologic provinces model where basins, ice, or lack of geological data fidelity obscure bedrock geology, particularly in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, much of Africa, East Antarctica, and eastern Australia. Additionally, some province types\u2014orogens, shields, and cratons that are homogenized within our global scheme\u2014can likely be partitioned into smaller terranes with more precise geodynamic attributes. Despite some of these shortcomings, the digital maps presented here form a self-consistent data standard for adding spatial metadata to geoscientific databases. The database is available on GitHub where the geoscience community can provide updates to improve the models and their contemporaneity as new knowledge is acquired. The files are also released in formats suitable for use in Generic Mapping Tools and GoogleEarth.\n               ","79":"\n                  The Late Jurassic\u2013Early Cretaceous is an interval of unstandardized stages and includes the only Mesozoic system boundary without a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point \u2013 the Jurassic\/Cretaceous (J\/K) boundary. Recent researches have been mainly focused on deep marine continuous successions from the Tethyan region and provided important progress in calibration of pelagic bioevents. Correlation of these pelagic zonations with the schemes from shallow marine deposits is still obscure. Biostratigraphical data from marginal carbonates containing fossils both from the platform and basinal facies can provide the required links between these two distinct depositional environments. This kind of Upper Jurassic\u2013Lower Cretaceous carbonates widely crop out in the Pontides (northern Turkey) in close association with related shallow and deep marine successions. A biostratigraphical dataset including 17 stratigraphical sections from this Pontides Carbonate Platform is synthesized. The fossil data include organisms from various depositional environments (i.e., benthic and planktonic foraminifers, calpionellids, algae, microencrusters and crinoids) and provides 139 bioevent datums (stratigraphic levels). This fossil dataset is analyzed through the methods of Graphic Correlation (GC) and Unitary Associations (UA) in order to overcome facies (past depositional conditions) controlled local biohorizons and calibrate fossil datums from unrelated phylogenies. Calibration of the Pontides Composite Reference Section (CSRS) with the Geological Time Scale (2020) reveals relative positions of both shallow and deep marine bioevents with respect to the Oxfordian\u2013Hauterivian stage boundaries. The Tithonian\/Berriasian and the Berriasian\/Valanginian boundaries can be easily delineated by calpionellid bioevents in pelagic successions. However, no synchronous shallow marine first\/last occurrence bioevents are available for both of these levels. Increased rates of originations toward Berriasian provide clustering of bioevents around the Tithonian\/Berriasian boundary and brackets for both pelagic and shallow marine deposits. Several last occurrences provide unreliable approximations for the Berriasian\/Valanginian boundary in neritic deposits. The species richness declines mid-Berriasian onward in accordance with the general trend toward lower sea levels through the late Tithonian into the Valanginian that diminished shallow marine factories and paved the way for a general Valanginian\u2013Hauterivian drowning phase for the Tethyan carbonate platforms. This also adds difficulties in finding reliable origination events in the shallow marine environments for this extinction dominated interval.\n               ","80":"\n                  The high velocity anomalies in global tomographic images indicate clearly the present large-scale subducting slabs and already-subducted old oceanic lithosphere in the deeper mantle. The subducted lithosphere can be identified by tracking the high velocity anomalies in the upper and lower mantle. We review several previous kinematic plate reconstruction models involved in the evolution of the Proto-South China Sea and point out challenges of the plate reconstruction for the plate-mantle system of the Proto-South China Sea. We used four global P-wave tomographic models and one global S-wave tomographic model in our analyses and have summarized model parameters and methodologies. We used the average P-wave velocity perturbation variations from four global P-wave tomographic models to constrain the distribution of the Proto-South China Sea lithosphere in the different horizontal slice depths. The north and south slabs of the Proto-South China Sea in the mantle were identified and interpreted from the different latitudinal and longitudinal direction vertical cross-sections from the MIT-P08 tomography model. We then discuss the repeatability of the Proto-South China Sea slabs in different global tomographic models and construct one slab subduction and evolution model of the Proto-South China Sea. The north slab of the Proto-South China Sea is one flat-lying slab at depths of ~400\u2013700\u00a0km in the mantle transition zone and the south slab of the Proto-South China Sea is one detached slab at depths of ~800\u20131600\u00a0km same as the Kalimantan anomaly identified by the previous tomographic images. Tearing and detachment of the Proto-South China Sea subducted oceanic lithosphere, could explain the distribution of the north slab and south slab in the mantle by either a double-sided subduction or single-sided subduction model. The plate-mantle system and the slab configuration involved in the Proto-South China Sea are complex and detached slabs of the Proto-South China Sea in the lower mantle requires the further high resolution local tomographic observations beneath Borneo.\n               ","81":"\n                  The rise of grasses using C4 photosynthesis and dominating grasslands during the latest Cenozoic is one of the most dramatic events in Earth's history. A growing body of geological records adds more details to this process, such as the study of fossil phytoliths. Phytolith data make it possible to track major grass lineages over time, and distinguish which kind of C4 grasses rise to dominate in a particular region. If the environmental niches of this kind of C4 grass are well studied, the corresponding environmental controls and driving mechanisms could be identified.\n                  Here, we combine geospatial data and climate data from two public archives to produce a database of ~12 million collections spanning ~6000 species of grasses with corresponding climate data to explore the quantitative relationship between the major grass lineages (subfamilies) and climate at global and regional scales. Our results show that the 10\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm of mean annual temperature is the transitional boundary of Pooideae and Panicoideae\/Chloridoideae distribution in North America and East Asia; the 400\u00a0mm isohyet of summer precipitation is the transitional boundary of Panicoideae and Chloridoideae distribution in North America and South Africa. However, the detailed environmental niches of certain grass lineages vary from region to region and are controlled by regional climate, topography and local species.\n                  Based on these data, the reanalysis of phytolith data since the Neogene reveals a distinct evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. The onset of modern like grassland happened in the early Miocene in both North America and East Asia, those original grasslands were most likely dominated by C3 Pooideae with minor Panicoideae (C4) and few Chloridoideae (C4); C4 expansion on both continents was based on substantial heterogeneity in vegetation, with similar aridity in climate as a possible driver, but with different timings and results: the rise of Chloridoideae in North America at 8\u20135\u00a0Ma and the rise of Panicoideae in East Asia at ~11\u00a0Ma. We suggest that synchronous changes in Asian monsoon precipitation and temperature are responsible for the rise of Panicoidaeae in East Asia, whereas the combination of warm and semiarid climates is responsible for the rise of Chloridoideae in North America. We emphasize the importance of regional environmental control on the evolution and distribution of the major grass lineages and offer a database that could be used to reconstruct palaeoclimate by phytoliths in different regions.\n               ","82":"\n                  Accurately estimating depositional ages of sedimentary strata is crucial for resolving basin evolution and architecture, and this is particularly important in convergent-margin basins where structural deformation of strata impedes stratigraphic correlations unassisted by age constraints. Depositional ages of strata are commonly determined using biostratigraphy, ash bed chronology, and detrital zircon (DZ) maximum depositional ages (MDAs). Herein, we use DZ methods to estimate depositional ages, and we compare these estimates to biostratigraphically-defined ages. From this comparison we suggest best practices for establishing depositional ages using DZ with the intent of refining the chronostratigraphies of convergent-margin basins. To do this, we review and compare all available age data for the lower Nanaimo Group, a forearc succession which partially comprises the fill of the Georgia Basin, British Columbia, Canada. These data include macrofossils, an absolute age from an ash bed, and large-n DZ datasets; the data span the geographical and temporal range of the lower Nanaimo Group. Using the biochronological dataset, we summarize the age ranges of all index fossils used in the biostratigraphic scheme for the lower Nanaimo Group. Using the DZ dataset, we generate MDAs, a multi-dimensional scaling plot, and a map of DZ age spectra. These data are plotted and compared in stratigraphic context on a recently developed chronostratigraphic scheme for the lower Nanaimo Group.\n                  The DZ MDA calculation method which most reliably estimates true depositional age is YGC2\u03c3, which is calculated by taking the weighed average of the youngest grain cluster with overlapping 2\u03c3 uncertainties. YGC2\u03c3 is reliable because it incorporates most\/all measurements originating from the youngest source of a DZ sample. By comparison, MDA methods that employ a limited number of youngest grains, such as youngest 3 grain (Y3Zo), only incorporate grains from the young tail of the youngest source, leading to inaccurately young MDAs. Conversely, YGC2\u03c3 is susceptible to incorporating grains from a slightly older source. To detect influence from older sources, we introduce the \u2018MDA comparison plot\u2019, a graph that compares the number of grains incorporated into a DZ sample's YGC2\u03c3 to the difference between its YGC2\u03c3 and Y3Zo MDA. Samples with greater than expected differences between their YGC2\u03c3 and Y3Zo MDAs are likely influenced by grains from older sources, and should be processed using DZ unmixing software.\n                  As sources for convergent-margin basins tend to evolve in predictable ways, we propose that DZ age spectra can be used to separate strata into temporally-equivalent packages with similar provenance. We observe these changes in age spectra across a documented disconformity in the lower Nanaimo Group. On the basis of this reasoning, we identify a previously unknown disconformity within the Georgia Basin and the existence of older strata. This work serves as an example of how DZ methods can compliment biostratigraphy to accurately estimate the age and architecture of strata in convergent-margin settings.\n               ","83":"\n                  Erosion by landslides is a common phenomenon in mountain regions around the globe, affecting all climatic zones. Landslides facilitate bedrock weathering, pedogenesis and ecological succession, being key drivers of biodiversity. Landslide chronosequences have long been used for studies of vegetation succession in initial ecosystems, but they further offer ideal model systems for studies of soil development and microbial community succession. In this review we synthesize the state of knowledge on the role of landslides in ecosystems, their influence on element cycles and interactions with biota. Further, we discuss feedback mechanisms between global warming, landslide activity and greenhouse gas emissions. In the view of increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change, soils are becoming a critical resource. Due to their ubiquity, landslide chronosequences have the potential to provide critical insights into soil development under different climates and thereby contribute to future soil restoration efforts.\n               ","84":"\n                  Despite more the 40\u202fyears of active debate, consensus interpretations of the late Palaeozoic-early Mesozoic tectonic-related geology of the northern periphery of Gondwana, including central and western Turkey, the south Aegean, the southern Balkans and Sicily remain elusive. Recent plate tectonic reconstructions differ drastically for this region. Utilising published information this paper summarises, interprets and discusses a large body of multidisciplinary geological evidence related to the transition from Palaeotethys to Neotethys, mainly during late Carboniferous to early Jurassic time. Key geological information is outlined, discussed, and then used to test alternative plate tectonic models: none are entirely convincing.\n                  During the Carboniferous, the developing Varsican orogen of central Europe passed eastwards into a marine gulf, then into Palaeotethys. Plate convergence and continental collision constructed the Varsican orogen in central Europe by end-early Carboniferous (c. 320\u202fMa), whereas subduction continued farther east. Variscan continental collision in central and western Europe was followed by late Carboniferous-Permian orogenic collapse, extension\/transtension and widespread right-lateral strike-slip displacements that are also likely to have affected the Balkan-Aegean and Anatolian regions.\n                  In the South Aegean, the Balkans (e.g. Albania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia) and Sicily, Permian-early Triassic basin development, including volcanism, relates to crustal extension\/transtension adjacent to the northern margin of Gondwana. Palaeogeography played an important role in Permian-Triassic clastic sediment deposition (e.g. detrital zircons), in addition to plate tectonic setting.\n                  In central and western Turkey, much evidence links the Afyon zone (Anatolides) to adjacent north Gondwana, rather than supporting an origin as an exotic Eurasian terrane that collided with the Tauride continent during latest Triassic time. Evidence from the Eurasian periphery (Bulgaria; N Turkey; Armenia; Georgia; Iran) favours overall northward subduction of Palaeotethys. However, the evidence of upper Carboniferous accretionary complexes in central and western Turkey (Konya Complex, Teke Dere Unit) and the eastern Aegean (Karaburun melange in Turkey; Chios melange in Greece), coupled with upper Carboniferous calc-alkaline granitic magmatism in the Afyon zone, suggests a short-lived southward subduction event along the N margin of Gondwana (i.e. bivergent subduction).\n                  During the Triassic, northward subduction persisted along the Eurasian margin, whereas the opposing North Gondwana margin rifted, associated with late Triassic opening of the both the S Neotethys (=Mesogea) and the N Neotethys (=\u0130zmir-Ankara-Erzincan ocean). Interpretations involving a Triassic relict Palaeotethys, followed by continent-continent collision in the south Aegean (e.g. Crete; Peloponnese) are problematic. Instead, pulsed continental extension appears to have culminated in rifting of \u2018Cimmeria' from N Africa (Apulia) during the Triassic and opening of both the S Neotethys to the south and the Pindos ocean to the north (in present co-ordinates).\n                  Regional plate tectonic reconstructions remain disparate because the Africa-Eurasia plate framework is poorly constrained prior to the early Jurassic, evidence is concealed beneath the sea or land, or was lost during later subduction\/collision. Large-plate tectonics have limited applicability in relatively narrow oceanic areas involving microcontinents, rifts, small ocean basins and strike-slip displacements. Additional field-based studies of key exposures are a priority.\n               ","85":"\n                  The North China Craton (NCC) is distinguished from the majority of Archean cratons in the world by its extensive records of late Neoarchean (2.6\u20132.5 Ga) mafic magmatism but its rare records of early Neoarchean (ca. 2.8\u20132.7 Ga) magmatism. Controversial issues have long existed on the tectonic setting of these mafic magmatisms, and it has been enigmatic about the role that the NCC has played in the Archean global tectonics. These issues are addressed by an integrated study of whole-rock major and trace elements as well as zircon Hf and whole-rock Nd isotopes in late Archean basaltic-andesitic rocks from the NCC. There are three episodes of basaltic-andesitic magmatism at ca. 2.88\u20132.73 Ga, ca. 2.65\u20132.60 Ga, and ca. 2.56\u20132.50 Ga, respectively. The first two phases are almost entirely tholeiitic basalts, whereas the last phase is composed of tholeiitic basaltic rocks, tholeiitic andesitic rocks and calc-alkaline rocks. The tholeiitic suites can be subdivided into LREE-depleted and LREE-enriched types in terms of their (La\/Sm)N ratios, and the calc-alkaline suites are categorized into conventional andesitic rocks and sanukitoids according to their La\/Yb and Sr\/Y ratios as well as Sr and Ba concentrations. These rocks show island arc basalts (IAB)-like trace element distribution patterns and high water contents, indicating their formation through subduction zone magmatism. The LREE-depleted basaltic rocks were derived from partial melting of a mantle source that was weakly metasomatized by subduction zone fluids (mainly aqueous solutions), whereas the LREE-enriched basaltic rocks were originated from a mantle source that was significantly metasomatized by subduction zone fluids (including both aqueous solutions and hydrous melts). The tholeiitic andesitic rocks were generated by magma differentiation of the tholeiitic basaltic rocks. The coexistence of LREE-depleted and LREE-enriched tholeiitic rocks resembles the bimodal rock assemblage in backarc basins above modern oceanic subduction zones. The calc-alkaline andesitic rocks and sanukitoids were produced by partial melting of metasomatic domains that were generated by reaction of the mantle wedge peridotite with the hydrous melts, but the mantle source of sanukitoids contain more crustal components with higher melt\/peridotite ratios of >0.1, in which the metasomatic agent would contain variable amounts of the low-degree partial melt from dehydrated melting of the subducting basaltic crust. The dominance of tholeiitic basaltic rocks and the lack of >2.8 Ga relict zircons in the basaltic-andesitic rocks indicate that the Archean NCC was characterized by development of a series of oceanic arcs around the continental nuclei. The common occurrence of bimodal basaltic rocks suggests the widespread development of backarc basins in the Neoarchean NCC with respect to the Archean plate tectonics. From the early to late Neoarchean, the basaltic-andesitic rocks became more enriched in alkali contents, higher in K2O\/Na2O ratios, and more enriched in Nd and Hf isotope compositions. This indicates that more and more crustal materials were recycled into their mantle sources through oceanic subduction in this period. Compared to the other Archean cratons elsewhere on Earth, the NCC is significantly deficient in komatiites and komatiite-related rocks, but it contains much higher proportions of the LREE-enriched basaltic rocks and calc-alkaline andesitic rocks. This difference suggests that the formation of the NCC was primarily driven by oceanic subduction though the mantle plume would locally operate at ca. 2.8 Ga in the western Shandong region. Large-scale subduction of the oceanic slab in the NCC would be initiated at ca. 2.65\u20132.60 Ga for mafic arc magmatism due to the convergence of heterogeneous oceanic plates.\n               ","86":"\n                  Geologic molecular hydrogen (H2) occurs in the subsurface and vents and seeps at the surface. However, this valuable natural resource is under-utilized in the economy because the distribution, abundance and origins of H2 are poorly understood. I studied a global dataset of 6246 natural gases with reported H2 concentrations from 16 different geological habitats. The average H2 concentration in all gas samples is 3.5%, but the median concentration is only 0.01%. Gases sampled in Mid-Ocean Ridges and in serpentinites have the highest average concentrations of H2 (~24% and ~21%, respectively). More than 30 different processes may produce H2 observed in natural gases. Hydrogen isotopic composition (expressed as \u03b4\n                     2H-H2 values) may indicate crustal (<-650\u2030) or mantle and primordial (from -650\u2030 to -100\u2030) sources of H2, or may result from temperature-dependent equilibration of H2 with water. Much of crustal H2 may be sourced by the reactions of serpentinization, while the quantitative significance of other H2-generating processes such as radiolytic decomposition of water and hydrocarbons, fracture-induced reduction of water, petroleum cracking and coal metamorphism remain speculative. Primordial H2 perhaps vents in some volcanic settings.

In this contribution, a review of the deformation structures of different terranes is discussed with their tectonic implications and global correlation with other supercontinent assemblies. In the west, the NE-SW trending Neoproterozoic South Delhi terrane is marked by coaxial folding between DF1 and DF2 along the NE-SW axis and cross folded by DF3 folds in the NW-SE axis. Several meso- to large-scale DF2 thrusts and DF4 fractures occur in the belt, that acted as channels for the exhumation of granulite and basement gneisses. Excess shortening led to orogen parallel extension and lateral escape of the material that reactivated the DF2 thrusts as strike-slip faults. Based on the ages of syn-DF1 granite gneisses, DF4 fractures, the South Delhi orogeny has been constrained between 0.87 and 0.6\u00a0Ga. The Paleoproterozoic North Delhi Terrane is marked by a coaxial folding between NF1 and NF2 folds and later cross-folded by NW-SE trending NF3 folds, producing dome- and basin-structures. Age of syntectonic granite and late-stage metamorphism constrain the north Delhi orogeny between 1.8 and 0.96\u00a0Ga. The Paleoproterozoic Aravalli Terrane is divided into a shallow-marine eastern and deeper marine western part by the Rakhabdev suture zone. The entire assemblage of terranes was folded by NE-SW isoclinal and recumbent AF1 folds which, with progressive deformation, were reoriented with a E-W axial trend. The AF2 is upright and NE-SW trending. The AF3 folds are E-W to NW-SE trending and have produced type 1 and type 2 interference patterns, with AF2 and AF1 respectively. Age of syn-AF1 migmatisation in the northern part and syn-AF3 granites in the south constrain the Aravalli orogeny between 1.7 and 0.96\u00a0Ga, coeval with the North Delhi orogeny. The granulite and charnockite were tectonically emplaced within the Sandmata Complex during the Aravalli orogeny. The Archean Bhilwara terrane, produced from the Bhilwara orogeny, marks the stabilisation of the crust in NW India by the intrusion of Berach and equivalent granites at 2.6\u00a0Ga. The terrane is divided into the Sandmata and Mangalwar complexes that consist of migmatite gneisses with slivers of greenstone. Several Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary schist belts were tectonically interlaced within the Mangalwar Complex. The migmatitic rocks of the terrane show flow folding in various directions while the schist belts are characterized by extremely appressed NE-SW trending reclined folds (BF1 and BF2), inverted BF2 folds, E-W open BF3 folds, and multiple strike-slip shear zones and thrusts. The ADMB exhibits a syntaxial bend in the eastern part attributed to indentation tectonics by Berach granite during syn-South Delhi orogeny. The Aravalli orogeny can be correlatable with Nuna orogeny, whereas the South Delhi orogeny can be correlated with the Pan-African orogeny that gave rise to Columbia and Gondwanaland Supercontinent assembly. The Grenville orogeny has experienced thermal rejuvenation in the Aravalli and Bhilwara terranes.\n               ","88":"\n                  The Earth experienced fundamental tectonic transformation and paleoclimatic upheavals during the early Paleoproterozoic (2.50\u20132.20\u00a0Ga). However, the tectonic framework of this crucial period is challenging to define precisely because of the tectono-magmatic \u201cslowdown\u201d. Here we carry on a comprehensive compilation of published 2.50\u20132.20\u00a0Ga magmatism in the North China Craton (NCC), in order to provide key constraints on the Archean-Proterozoic transition. All the rocks can be divided into two stages including three subgroups: stage 1 (2.50\u20132.42\u00a0Ga), stage 2\u20131 (2.42\u20132.25\u00a0Ga), and stage 2\u20132 (2.25\u20132.20\u00a0Ga). Rocks of stage 1 are mainly gabbros, sanukitoid-like rocks, diorites, tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG), and potassic granites. The TTGs are medium to high pressure (MP-HP) series and likely derived from subducted slabs. The gabbros and sanukitoid-like rocks were from enriched mantle sources. The diorites and K-rich granites were from partial melting of different levels of crust. The rock associations are representative of the continuation of the Neoarchean cratonization and record a tectonic shift from subduction-collision to post-collision. The youngest high-K granites (ca. 2.42\u00a0Ga) may mark the real termination of the \u201cNeoarchean\u201d cratonization in the NCC. Rocks of stage 2\u20131 are mainly komatiitic rocks, gabbros, low-pressure (LP) TTGs, diorites, and A-type granites. Rocks of stage 2\u20132 comprise basalt-dacite-rhyolite and granitic anatectic melt. The komatiitic rocks likely derived from the asthenospheric mantle possibly related to a plume setting. The mafic rocks were sourced from an ancient and enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The upwelling mantle-derived melts further induced partial melting of the cratonic lower to upper crust to form the LP TTGs, diorites, and A-type granites. The stage 2 rock associations were emplaced as typical intraplate magmatism, recording initiation and development of a plume-triggered rift setting. These observations are further supported by our new data on 2.32\u20132.27\u00a0Ga rocks in the southern NCC, including, but not limited to, LP-TTGs, gabbros, and A-type granites. Subsequently, rifting continually developed (2.20\u20132.10\u00a0Ga) and a tectonic transition ensued from passive to active continental margin (2.20\u20132.05\/2.00\u00a0Ga, e.g., Peng et al., 2012) until subduction-collision-post-collision occurred (1.95\u20131.80\u00a0Ga; e.g., Zhao et al., 2002a, 2002b). From a global perspective, the early Paleoproterozoic tectono-magmatic events in the NCC tend to be synchronized to those of the world including rifting magmatism, and large igneous provinces (LIPs), etc. During the early Paleoproterozoic rifting processes, sulphur dioxide (e.g., SO2) was likely to be released into the atmosphere by magmatic events (e.g., LIPs), and continental uplift would have induced weathering, erosion, and delivery of bioessential nutrients to the ocean, all these were vital to the paleoenvironmental changes, lowering pCO2 and introducing glacial conditions.\n               ","89":"\n                  The morphological boundary between the Himalayas and the foreland plain is well expressed and most often corresponds to the frontal emergence of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). This boundary is affected by surface ruptures during very large Himalayan earthquakes (Mw\u00a0>\u00a08) that regularly induce (with a recurrence of the order of 500 to 1200\u00a0years) the uplift of the foothills relative to the plain.\n                  However, a thrust-fold system is hidden beneath the plain and is displayed by the seismic profiles of oil companies in east\/central Nepal and by H\/V passive geophysical techniques in Darjeeling. Its long-term kinematic evolution is slow, with a tectonic uplift of the hanging wall that is lower than the subsidence rate of the foreland basin, that is, less than approximately half a millimetre per year. During phases of low sedimentation controlled by climatic fluctuations, the morphological surfaces of the piedmont are incised by large rivers for several tens of metres; therefore, structures hidden under the sediments emerge slightly in the plain.\n                  The evolution of the hidden structures corresponds to an embryonic thrust belt mainly affected by a long-term shortening rate of 1.4 +2.5\/\u2212\n                     1.2 mm\u00b7yr\u22121, that is, 2\u201320% of the shortening rate of the entire Himalayan thrust system. Nonetheless, the details of the deformation associated with the embryonic thrust belt are still poorly understood. Several deformation components could affect the central Himalayan and Darjeeling piedmonts. i) Any slow steady-state deformation, such as layer parallel shortening (LPS) is not detected by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data, and such deformation would therefore absorb less than 0.5\u00a0mm\u00b7yr\u22121. The geodetic data that suggest the aseismic growth of some of the structures are highly controversial. ii) For the rest of the deformation of the embryonic thrust wedge, it is yet to be proven whether deformation occurs during rare great earthquakes affecting the piedmont during medium earthquakes and\/or during post-seismic deformation related to great earthquakes. The amplitude of this long-term low deformation is too limited to significantly reduce the seismic hazard in the seismic gaps of the Himalayan belt. iii) In some portions of the Himalayan front, such as Darjeeling (India), the thrust deformation related to great earthquakes propagates several tens of kilometres south of the morphological front in the zone previously affected by the long-term low deformation. It induces multi-metre surface ruptures in the piedmont and a mean shortening of 8.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2\u00a0mm\u00b7yr\u22121. iiii) Pre-existing faults in the bedrock of the Indian craton, often oblique to the Himalayan structures, are locally reactivated beneath the foreland plain with low deformation rates.\n               ","90":"\n                  Quantification of the frequency with which coastal-plain rivers avulse is important for elucidating autogenic dynamics and their role as controls on landscape change and stratigraphic architectures. An outstanding question exists, however, as to whether measures of avulsion frequency are inherently affected by the spatial and temporal scales at which they are evaluated, which has implications regarding our ability to make direct comparisons between different river systems or deltas. To address this problem, a quantitative analysis of the avulsion histories of 57 coastal-plain river systems is undertaken. Nine alternative measures of avulsion frequency are extracted. These are based on numbers of (i) avulsion events, (ii) active or abandoned channel courses, and (iii) delta lobes, all considered per unit time. Additional sets of avulsion-frequency proxies are established based on normalization of these numbers relative to the size of the area being studied, and to the number of distinct river systems that drain into that area. The sensitivity of these quantities to the spatial and temporal extent of study areas and time intervals, and their relationships with quantities describing the scale of the river systems, are assessed. All avulsion-frequency estimates demonstrate apparent negative relationships with the timespan over which they are determined; this may reflect global Holocene trends, or variations in resolution with the time window. Avulsion metrics that are not normalized by the planform extent of the study area do not show proportionality with the size of the study areas themselves, nor with the scale of the river systems; correspondingly, the spatio-temporal density of avulsion events tends to be higher for smaller rivers and associated study areas. This may be due to systematic variations in data resolution, to the influence of external controls that relate to the scale of deltas, or to inherent non-stationarity in the avulsion dynamics of lowland rivers, in association with forms of self-organization that do not vary with scale. Although non-normalized avulsion-frequency estimates do not scale with measures of river-system size, they are seen to correlate with progradation rates, which are themselves scaled to sediment discharge and catchment size. Practical considerations can be drawn on how avulsion frequency may be appropriately quantified to enable meaningful comparisons of the autogenic dynamics of coastal-plain rivers.\n               ","91":"\n                  Plate kinematic reconstructions available for the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous eastward drift and counterclockwise rotation of the Iberian plate imply a major left-lateral motion of Iberia with respect to Eurasia. According to most authors, this displacement has been accommodated along the transform North Pyrenean Zone. However, no relevant field evidence exists for the proposed >400\u00a0km of horizontal displacement along the North Pyrenean Fault. Several Permian-Mesozoic basins are distributed around the Iberia\/Eurasia plate boundary and have been more or less inverted during the Cenozoic Pyrenean Orogeny (i.e. Iberian Chain basins, North and South Pyrenean basins, Basque-Cantabrian Basin, Parentis Basin, Bay of Biscay\/Asturian margins). All of these basins experienced a complex kinematic history and shared the same tectono-stratigraphic evolution, with two successive rifting stages: (i) Permian-Triassic rifting following the dismantling of the Variscan belt and recording the early breakup of Pangea and (ii) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting developing after a Jurassic post-rift thermal cooling stage. Depending on the different techniques of investigation and on the interpretation of controversial datasets, authors proposed either opening by orthogonal rifting or by transtensional\/pull-apart tectonics for these basins.\n                  In this work, we propose a reappraisal of the processes responsible for the Mesozoic Iberia\/Eurasia plate boundary compartmentalization by reviewing the tectono-sedimentary history and the kinematic evolution of the sedimentary basins involved in this domain. We shed light on the fact that the Cretaceous left-lateral movement within the plate boundary was not accommodated by localized deformation along the single North Pyrenean Fault wrench structure, but rather by a distributed zone of deformation in which the transtensional regime was recorded by the sedimentary basins therein. We also suggest that other Permian-Mesozoic depocenters located below the Cenozoic foreland basins of the Pyrenean belt (i.e. the Ebro and Aquitaine basins) may have been active segments of this rift system. We then propose that the real extent of the Mesozoic plate boundary is roughly defined by two NW-SE trending lineaments corresponding to the southwestern margin of the Iberian Chain, on the Iberian side, and to the southern Armorican margin and the southwestern border of the French Central Massif, on the Eurasian side. The complex pre-Cretaceous tectono-sedimentary history of this region determined its peculiar pre-rift structure. Such structural inheritance may have favored a distributed rather than a localized mode of deformation at the Iberia\/Eurasia diffuse plate boundary during the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, whilst mechanisms related to the eastward propagation of the Bay of Biscay system might have been responsible for the final localization of the plate boundary along the Basque-Cantabrian\/North Pyrenean corridor.\n               ","92":"\n                  As CO2 concentration in the atmosphere rises, there is a need for improved physical understanding of its impact on global plant transpiration. This knowledge gap poses a major hurdle in robustly projecting changes in the global hydrologic cycle. For this reason, here we review the different processes by which atmospheric CO2 concentration affects plant transpiration, the several uncertainties related to the complex physiological and radiative processes involved, and the knowledge gaps which need to be filled in order to improve predictions of plant transpiration. Although there is a high degree of certainty that rising CO2 will impact plant transpiration, the exact nature of this impact remains unclear due to complex interactions between CO2 and climate, and key aspects of plant morphology and physiology. The interplay between these factors has substantial consequences not only for future climate and global vegetation, but also for water availability needed for sustaining the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Future changes in global plant transpiration in response to enhanced CO2 are expected to be driven by water availability, atmospheric evaporative demand, plant physiological processes, emergent plant disturbances related to increasing temperatures, and the modification of plant physiology and coverage. Considering the universal sensitivity of natural and agricultural systems to terrestrial water availability we argue that reliable future projections of transpiration is an issue of the highest priority, which can only be achieved by integrating monitoring and modeling efforts to improve the representation of CO2 effects on plant transpiration in the next generation of earth system models.\n               ","93":"\n                  Springs sustain groundwater-dependent ecosystems and provide freshwater for human use. Springs often occur because faults modify groundwater flow pathways leading to discharge from aquifers with sufficiently high pressure. This study reviews the key characteristics and physical processes, field investigation techniques, modelling approaches and management strategies for fault-controlled spring systems. Field investigation techniques suitable for quantifying spring discharge and fault characteristics are often restricted by high values of spring ecosystems, requiring mainly non-invasive techniques. Numerical models of fault-controlled spring systems can be divided into local-scale, process-based models that allow the damage zone and fault core to be distinguished, and regional-scale models that usually adopt highly simplified representations of both the fault and the spring. Water resources management relating to fault-controlled spring systems often involves ad hoc applications of trigger levels, even though more sophisticated management strategies are available. Major gaps in the understanding of fault-controlled spring systems create substantial risks of degradation from human activities, arising from limited data and process understanding, and simplified representations in models. Thus, further studies are needed to improve the understanding of hydrogeological processes, including through detailed field studies, physics-based modelling, and by quantifying the effects of groundwater withdrawals on spring discharge.\n               ","94":"\n                  \n                     Rodriguez-Tovar (2022) has relied on vertical facies models (e.g., the Bouma Sequence) for distinguishing one facies (e.g., turbidites) from the others.

Furthermore, he has omitted key features such as internal hiatus from the original contourite model and erosional contact from the original hyperpycnite facies model. These units with internal hiatus or erosional contact cannot function as a predictive facies model. In deep-water research, one cannot selectively dismiss previous observations in order to promote one's skewed narrative, which is that turbidite-, contourite-, and hyperpycnite-facies models are functional. Available literature is antithetical to this narrative. Therefore, the purpose of this discussion is to identify 10 fundamental problems that undermine the basic tenet of the review article on ichnological analysis of deep-marine facies.\n               ","95":"\n                  The world's most devastating local and ocean-wide tsunamis are generated by subduction zone earthquakes, but the mechanisms for powerful seafloor uplift and tsunami generation during seismic rupture propagation remain poorly understood. In particular, great earthquakes near the trench can generate outsize tsunamis that rival those produced by giant trench-breaking ruptures. Solving this conundrum is key to better assessing seismic and tsunami hazards at subduction zones. Here, we inspect high-resolution bathymetry, seismic reflection profiles, and tsunami-earthquake rupture models at global subduction zones to identify the structural control on tsunami excitation by coseismic seafloor uplift. We find that tsunami run-ups of trench-breaking ruptures correlate with the width of the outer wedge of the frontal accretionary prism, which consists of active imbricate or conjugate faults above the shallow megathrust. The prevalence of high-angle faults in the outer wedge provides the mechanism for more efficient seafloor uplift and thus tsunami wave excitation than coseismic slip on the shallow d\u00e9collement. We calibrate a power-law relationship with outer-wedge width and seismic moment to estimate the maximum tsunami run-up along major subduction zones. The tsunami excitation potential is among the highest at the northern Sumatra (Indonesia), Hikurangi (New Zealand), and western Makran (Iran) accretionary margins, and the lowest at the Costa Rica and Valdivia (Chile) erosive margins. The structural control of tsunami excitation is important to characterize the rupture style and tsunami magnitude of future seismicity at subduction zones, offering crucial information for seismic and tsunami hazard preparedness and rapid run-up assessment during the early-warning stage, especially at well-identified seismic gaps.\n               ","96":"\n                  Stretching of the Earth's upper crust is commonly accommodated by normal faulting, fault-related folding and\/or fracturing such as veins and joints.

The identification of BPS surfaces is, however, challenging due to their localised nature within bedded host rock sequences, the absence of suitable slip markers, and the scale and resolution of both outcrop and seismic reflection data. Here, we present examples of BPS identified within extensional fault systems in sedimentary sequences and outline the nature, magnitude, segmentation, and spatiotemporal distribution of BPS surfaces. These constraints provide a basis for defining the principal structural controls on BPS development and its geometric and kinematic relationship to normal faulting. We conclude that BPS is a common feature within multi-layered host rock sequences, irrespective of their lithological and mechanical properties, and is kinematically associated with a broad range of fault-related deformation, including bed rotations, flexural-slip folding, and both tectonic and gravity-driven sliding. The presence of BPS within normal fault systems can increase the complexity of the host rock volumes and fracture arrays with potential implications on subsurface fluid flow and seismicity.\n               ","97":"\n                  Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) is a numerical, calibrated-age dating technique based on the degree of weathering of rock surfaces. The Schmidt hammer measures the hardness or strength of a rock surface by means of R-values (rebound values), which are produced as the hammer impacts the surface. Age calibration is carried out with reference to at least two surfaces of known age (control surfaces). Mean R-values then yield numerical estimates of the time elapsed since exposure of rock surfaces to subaerial weathering. Under favourable circumstances with a sufficiently large number of impacts, SHD has an age resolution of 300\u2013500\u00a0years for rock surfaces exposed during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene, and a current age range of ~25\u00a0ka. Accurate independent dating of control surfaces and careful selection of sites to reduce the effects of lithological variability are essential. R-value distributions are an important aid in the interpretation of SHD ages from active and relict, synchronous and diachronous, single and multiple-event surfaces. Important research applications have been made within the fields of Quaternary geochronology, palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, geomorphology and subaerial processes, and landscape dynamics. SHD has been found particularly useful in relation to boulder deposits and bedrock surfaces in glacial and periglacial environments. There is much untapped potential in coastal, temperate and tropical landscapes wherever rock surfaces are exposed to undisturbed rock weathering. The advantages and limitations of SHD compare favourably with the complementary exposure-age technique of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND).

However, over the last several decades, the majority view of Mediterranean Mesozoic paleogeography has featured an ocean (Mesogea) that separated Adria and Africa in Mesozoic and early Cenozoic time. The presence of a Mesogea ocean has become an argument against the use of paleomagnetic data from Adria as a proxy for Africa, which has been central to the controversy surrounding alternative Permian configurations of Pangea (Pangea A or B). The rationale for Mesogea has been derived from the perceived need for oceanic lithosphere to feed Miocene to Recent subduction beneath the Tyrrhenian and Aegean seas, the apparent presence of Early Jurassic oceanic basement beneath the present-day Ionian Sea, and the presence of deep-water Permian and younger sedimentary rocks in Sicily. On the other hand, the presence of Mesogea is incompatible with the apparent continuity of Mesozoic sedimentary facies from North Africa and Sicily into Adria, and with increasingly well-documented consistency of paleomagnetic data from Adria and NW Africa. We argue that the subducting slabs beneath the Tyrrhenian and Aegean seas are delaminated continental-margin mantle lithosphere of Adria\/Africa stripped of its sedimentary cover and most of its crustal basement by thrusting. We propose, rather than an early Mesozoic (Mesogea) ocean between Adria and Africa, a sinistral strike-slip fault system linked Atlantic spreading in the West to the Neo-Tethys in the East, during the Middle and Late Jurassic, and featured pull-apart basins that included the Ionian and Levant basins of the eastern Mediterranean. In our modelling, Adria moved with Iberia during initial opening of the Central Atlantic in the Early and Middle Jurassic (after 203\u202fMa until 170\u202fMa). From mid-Jurassic time (170\u202fMa), Adria began to break away from Iberia with onset of rifting in the Piemonte-Ligurian Ocean, and, as the rate of southeasterly motion of Adria relative to North America lagged that of Africa, the Ionian-Levant basins formed as pull-apart basins along a sinistral strike-slip fault system parallel to a small circle about the 170\u2013154\u202fMa Euler stage pole for motion of Africa relative to Adria. From marine magnetic anomaly M25 time (154\u202fMa), Adria moved in synch with Africa and therefore pull-apart extension in the eastern Mediterranean came to a halt. The modeled opening of eastern Mediterranean pull-apart basins is consistent with the observed resemblance of Permian and younger paleomagnetic poles from Adria and NW Africa. The Atlantic Euler poles used to map these paleogeographic changes, when applied to Permian paleomagnetic poles from Adria, Africa, and elsewhere, support the existence of Pangea B in Early Permian time (280\u202fMa) with transformation to Pangea A by the Late Permian (260\u202fMa).\n               ","100":"\n                  Recent tomography-based tectonic (tomotectonic) reconstructions provide important new insights on past subduction processes.

We suggest this is due to two common simplifications: 1) slabs sink vertically after subduction with their present geographic locations marking past trenches, and 2) slabs sink at a constant rate throughout the mantle with their present mantle depths linearly correlating with their subduction ages. In this study, we investigate the 4D evolution of subducted slabs using global data-assimilation models that successfully reproduce observed mantle slabs along all major subduction zones. We find that slabs can migrate laterally up to 6000\u00a0km while descending toward the core-mantle boundary (CMB). This enormous displacement mostly reflects strong and geographically variable horizontal mantle flow. The model results further show that the vertical sinking rate of slabs varies with subduction duration, depth, and geographic locations. The slab sinking rate generally decreases with increasing depth, ranging from >2\u00a0cm\/yr above 1600\u00a0km depth to zero at ~500\u00a0km above the CMB. The sinking rate locally peaks at the asthenospheric and mid-mantle depths and diminishes at the base of the transition zone. We further find that surface plate motion strongly affects the horizontal migration of slabs but less affects their sinking rate. These results suggest cautions on inferring past tectonic events based on seismic tomography.\n               ","101":"\n                  Permafrost degradation poses serious threats to both natural and human systems through its influence on ecological\u2013hydrological processes, infrastructure stability, and the climate system. The Arctic and the Third Pole (Tibetan Plateau, TP hereafter) are the two northern regions on Earth with the most extensive permafrost areas. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons of permafrost characteristics and its climate and eco-environment between these two regions and their susceptibility to disturbances. This study provides a comprehensive review of the climate, ecosystem characteristics, ground temperature, permafrost extent, and active-layer thickness, as well as the past and future changes in permafrost in the Arctic and the TP. The potential consequences associated with permafrost degradation are also examined. Lastly, possible connections between the two regions through land-ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions are explored. Both regions have experienced dramatic warming in recent decades, characterized by Arctic amplification and elevation-dependent warming on the TP. Permafrost temperatures have increased more rapidly in the Arctic than on the TP, and will likely be reinforced under a future high emission scenario. Near-surface permafrost extents are projected to shrink in both regions in the coming decades, with a more dramatic decline in the TP. The active layer on the TP is thicker and has substantially deepened, and is projected to thicken more than in the Arctic. Widespread permafrost degradation increases geohazard risk and has already wielded considerable effects on the human and natural systems. Permafrost changes have also exerted a pronounced impact on the climate system through changes in permafrost carbon and land\u2013atmosphere interactions. Future research should involve comparative studies of permafrost dynamics in both regions that integrate long-term observations, high-resolution satellite measurements, and advanced Earth System models, with emphasis on linkages between the two regions.\n               ","102":"\n                  Tenerife, one of the active oceanic island volcanoes in the Canary Islands, located in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off northwest Africa, is the second largest intraplate oceanic island volcanic system after Hawai'i but is more complex and represents a different and more evolved end-member to Hawai'i in the spectrum of oceanic island volcanic systems. Tenerife began life as a mafic oceanic shield volcano at ~12\u00a0Ma, erupting (picro)basalt, basanite, hawaiite, mugearite, benmoreite series lavas of the Older Basaltic Series. These were derived from a spatially variable mantle plume source with varying degrees of magma-lithosphere interaction and fractional crystallisation. At ~3.05\u00a0Ma an evolved phonolitic magma system began to develop under the centre of the island. That led to the building of an initial summit effusive and explosive stratovolcano system (the Las Ca\u00f1adas edifice) represented by the poorly understood Lower Group, followed by development of 3\u00a0cycles of explosive phonolitic caldera forming activity (Ucanca, Guajara, Diego Hern\u00e1ndez) of the Upper Group, from ~1.66\u00a0Ma to ~0.175 Ma, each cycle separated by ~180 kyr (the recharge interval?). Phonolite genesis is complex, involving fractional crystallisation, partial melting of island crust including syenitic plutons, and recycling of crystal mushes. Three coalesced explosive calderas are preserved at the summit of Tenerife, constituting the Las Ca\u00f1adas Caldera Complex. Since ~0.175 Ma two stratovolcanoes (Teide, Pico Viejo) have been growing along the northern rim of the caldera complex, becoming more phonolitic from basaltic beginnings and more explosive, perhaps heralding the beginning of a new explosive cycle. Simultaneously shield building basaltic volcanism has continued on the flanks to historic times through multiple monogenetic eruptions along the linear northwestern and northeastern rift zones, and a more diffuse southern volcanic zone. Volcanic eruption styles have included fissure fed basaltic shield sheet lava eruptions, monogenetic basaltic cone lava and scoria eruptions, highly explosive plinian phonolitic pumice and ash fallout, and pyroclastic flow forming eruptions. The volumes of the largest explosive eruptions likely caused a component of magma chamber roof block subsidence, with multiple, spaced eruptions during each caldera forming cycle producing incremental caldera collapse and polygenetic calderas. Major landslides coincide with some of the large explosive eruptions, raising the question of cause and effect.\n               ","103":"\n                  The Asian summer monsoon is a major regional phenomenon that drives and regulates precipitation over the Asian subcontinent. Understanding monsoon dynamics is a fascinating research question that reveals spatiotemporal variations in a variety of settings. The present study is based on previously available proxy data in order to get a better understanding of monsoon behaviour and associated physical processes, as well as their dynamics at annual scales. Several in-phase and out-of-phase links have been discovered in Asia during the last 1000 years. The present syntheses reveal evidence of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) during 1003\u20131210 C.E. and 1312\u20131730 C.E., respectively, that are otherwise distinct from the polar regions. In addition, the Asian monsoon shows a weaker trend during the LIA and relatively stronger during the MCA. Furthermore, the LIA event in Asia was shorter and weaker than the one in the Arctic and subarctic regions. Similarly, tree-ring isotopic data shows that monsoon activity has decreased in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) during the last several decades, whereas mean annual precipitation has increased in Tibet. Furthermore, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) show strong correlations from 1049 to 1995 C.E., but the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has emerged as the most influential driver for the Asian monsoon in recent decades, according to comparisons and global teleconnections analyses. The association of the monsoon with AMO and ENSO, as well as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), has to be investigated further using multiple proxies, such as tree-ring, speleothem, and pollen, etc., so that future monsoon forecasts for the Asian region become more accurate. The monsoon is constantly changing and shifting, affecting the size and frequency of floods and droughts in the region. As a result, for monsoon modelling and prediction, the current synthesis on monsoon variability, as well as annual variation in contemporary and historical archives, is important. Furthermore, it has larger implications not just for the region's enormous population's fresh water and food security but also for the management of hydro-geomorphology-based natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and droughts, which pose a threat to life and property across Asia.\n               ","104":"\n                  Trilobites were the most successful clade of marine invertebrates during the Cambrian, as highlighted by Sepkoski's Cambrian Evolutionary Fauna. After the Cambrian they were still abundant, widespread and highly diversified. Previous analyses show that trilobite diversity dynamics during the Ordovician can be summarized by several trilobite evolutionary faunas. Trilobites, however, were severely affected by the end-Ordovician extinction event, and never again reached such a high diversity. Here we investigate the evolutionary history of trilobites after this crisis by evaluating how their diversity dynamics are structured in evolutionary faunas and what could be the environments influencing these faunas. Using occurrences from the Paleobiology Database, we estimate the post-Ordovician palaeobiodiversity of trilobites by coverage rarefaction (SQS) and identify trilobite evolutionary faunas by means of factor analysis. During the Silurian, trilobite taxonomic richness was relatively high and the Silurian Fauna was dominated by the families that appeared in the Ordovician and survived the end-Ordovician extinction, such as Odontopleuridae and Encrinuridae. A Devonian Fauna established progressively since the end of the Silurian as other families diversified, such as Acastidae and Tropidocoryphidae. The Early Devonian records the highest post-Ordovician diversity, probably favoured by the spreading of epicontinental shallow seas. Abrupt sea-level changes and anoxic events during the Middle Devonian strongly reduced trilobite diversity and brought both Silurian and Devonian Faunas close to their disappearance. During the Late Devonian, trilobite diversity was low and dominated by phacopids and proetids, which characterize a Kellwasser Fauna. Finally, the Hangenberg event (end-Devonian) affected all existing trilobite clades and the following Tournaisian diversification led to the Late Palaeozoic Fauna, composed of phillipsiids and brachymetopids. Despite an important diversity decrease in the Visean\u2013Serpukhovian, this fauna was the only one to persist until the extinction of trilobites at the end of the Permian.\n               ","105":"\n                  A review of the tectonic events recorded by sediments on the Andean continental margin of northern Peru and Ecuador and on the accreted oceanic terranes of Ecuador, allows to identify three tectonic events of late Campanian to late Paleocene age (~75 to ~55\u00a0Ma). Each tectonic event resulted in the arrival of quartz-rich deposits on the oceanic units and in a sedimentary hiatus in the backarc zone (Oriente basin), which both indicate an uplift of the South-American continental margin. This is interpreted as the underplating of oceanic terranes beneath the Andean continental margin. After the Incaic contractional phase (~40\u00a0Ma), the Oriente Basin recorded a sharp increase in the subsidence rate, the westward migration of the depocenters and a drastic change in the detrital source around 25\u00a0Ma, which indicate the onset of its foreland basin evolution, driven by flexural subsidence. It is therefore proposed that the Ecuadorian Andes resulted first from the evolution of a western, west-verging orogenic wedge, made of accreted oceanic material (~75\u201340\u00a0Ma). Once this western wedge overthickened and submitted to strong vertical body forces, the strain related to ocean-continent convergence was transmitted to the continental plate, where a second, eastern, east-verging orogenic wedge formed about 25\u00a0Ma ago. This scenario accounts for the tectonic and sedimentary evolution of the Ecuadorian-north Peruvian margin, and explains why, in spite of a moderate elevation, the partly oceanic crustal root of the Ecuadorian Andes, is almost as thick as beneath the high-altitude Altiplano of southern Peru and Bolivia, where the crustal root is mainly of continental nature.\n               ","106":"\n                  Interactions between along-slope bottom currents and down-slope turbidity flows can create a myriad of features and deposits. Despite numerous efforts to differentiate contourites from turbidites and mixed features, reliable diagnostic criteria are still lacking from the stratigraphic and sedimentological viewpoints. The main aim of this study is to develop criteria to differentiate mixed, along-slope-, and down-slope-generated elements from other deep-water deposits across bathymetric, seismic and sediment core data.\n                  Mixed (turbidite-contourite) systems can be placed in three main groups based on their location, dimensions, elongation, lateral migration, spatial and temporal variability: 1) turbidite-dominated mixed systems, 2) synchronous systems, and 3) contourite-dominated mixed systems. The persistence of bottom currents \u2014in addition to their velocity, direction, and hydrodynamic fluctuations\u2014 is responsible for entraining and redistributing fine-grained particles, carried in suspension by coeval turbidity flows, and reworking previously deposited sediments. Changes in turbidity current velocity, frequency, and duration condition the provision of sediments and development of turbidites along mixed systems. Several preliminary models are also being proposed in this study, in order to enhance our understanding of the lateral and vertical distribution of mixed systems across the sedimentary record.\n                  Interactions between along- and down-slope processes may be synchronous, asynchronous or passive. Synchronous interactions typically occur within the same physiographic setting and the two processes interact coevally in space and time. Asynchronous interactions are also common across the modern and ancient sedimentary records, as bottom currents sweep across the deep-water environments during breaks of the turbidity flows. Passive interactions occur along the distal margins of mixed systems, or when the two processes occur near each other but do not cross over in time. Further controlling factors are held to be influential in the evolution of mixed systems at the short- to long-term; varying degrees of confinement, sediment supply or climatic fluctuations can generate cyclic stacking patterns and affect their overall dimensions. Accordingly, mixed systems feature more complex geometries than previously believed, as interactions may generate new secondary processes and features. Such systems form potential plays and may become future targets for energy geosciences and other research fields.\n               ","107":"\n                  Although Ce anomalies are commonly used to reconstruct past seawater redox conditions, published interpretations are based on various proxy materials and analytical approaches, while no relatively complete compilation of sedimentary Ce anomaly data has yet been made. Here, we report a new compilation comprising >6000 carbonate, iron formation, phosphorite, and chert samples of all ages, of which 1127 passed screening for near primary Ce anomaly values. The Ce anomalies of 592 mudstones were also investigated and found to contain in some cases unambiguous traces of a primary negative Ce anomaly, which was likely inherited during early diagenetic organic degradation or directly from authigenic phases. Here we show that seawater-like rare earth element (REE) patterns may be retained in siliceous mudstones in cases where the detrital REE signature has been diluted by authigenic silica. Mudstone weathering is shown to have a negligible effect on the magnitude of negative Ce anomalies in moderately weathered samples.\n                  A critical appraisal of negative Ce anomalies from the published literature, yet to be confirmed through La-Ce isotopic dating, implies that oxygenic photosynthesis likely evolved during 3.0\u20132.5\u00a0Ga. Although our compilation does not capture the onset of the Great Oxidation Episode, a decreasing trend in mean negative Ce anomalies from 2.5 to 2.1\u00a0Ga is in accordance with a rise in oxygen levels during the early Paleoproterozoic. Sporadic Ce anomalies might identify transient oxygenation events during 1.8\u20131.2\u00a0Ga with minimum atmospheric concentrations up to 1\u20136% present atmospheric level. Statistical analysis of Ce anomaly data is consistent with progressive oxygenation of the surface ocean through the late Tonian-early Cambrian interval. While pronounced negative Ce anomalies indicate that shallow marine settings were broadly well oxygenated during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, the deeper marine environment remained largely anoxic, consistent with the persistence of a dissolved organic carbon redox buffer. The Ce anomaly compilation also reveals expanded ocean anoxia in the early Paleozoic, followed by more pervasive oxygenation by middle Devonian times, coincident with the emergence and radiation of secondary woody tissues and forests. The redox evolution and estimated pO2 revealed by Ce anomalies are generally compatible with other proxies and modelling results, and therefore we concur that the marine sedimentary Ce anomaly record responds sensitively to oceanic redox changes and can be a useful additional proxy to track Earth system evolution.\n               ","108":"\n                  The Coniacian-Santonian (C-S) was a time of differentiation in marine sedimentation, characterized by organic carbon (OC)-rich black shales and carbonates interpreted as the last oceanic anoxic event, OAE3, versus OC-poor white\/reddish limestones, chalk, and claystones known as Cretaceous Oceanic Red Beds (CORBs). Based on compiled geochemical and isotope proxy data of more than 95 study sites and sections, two high-resolution global carbon isotope curves for C-S carbonate and organic matter (OM) were reconstructed based on statistical analysis and discriminated three main levels of short amplitude (around 0.5\u2030), yet globally recognizable, carbon isotope excursions. These excursions, each some 0.4 to 0.7\u00a0Ma in duration, are characterized by regionally restricted benthic anoxia and sea-level highstands that best explain the OM accumulation during the OAE3 subevents defined herein as OAE3a (late mid-Coniacian, ca. 86.9\u00a0Ma, Kingsdown Event), OAE3b (late mid-Santonian, ca. 85.0\u00a0Ma, Horseshoe Bay Event), and OAE3c (late Santonian to Santonian-Campanian Boundary Event, ca. 83.5\u00a0Ma).\n                  For a better understanding of the C-S climate evolution on a regional to global scale, a global compilation of \u03b418O from benthic and planktonic foraminifers and bulk carbonate was conducted and tested for pCO2 trends based on \u039413C curves. Thus, the C-S palaeoclimate can be divided into (1) a steady state phase of warm greenhouse climate during the Coniacian, followed by (2) a hot greenhouse during the early Santonian that might be consistent with the activation of the Central Kerguelen large igneous province (LIP), and (3) a longer-term cooling of the warm greenhouse climate from the mid-Santonian onwards. The mechanism controlling OC-poor versus OC-rich deposition can be attributed mainly to palaeoceanographic conditions such as water column oxygenation and circulation pattern changes during the C-S. OM-rich deposition is largely restricted to the low-latitude Atlantic and adjacent epeiric and shelf seas. Areas of enhanced oceanic circulation systems with a westward-directed Tethyan current, and regional eddies of water mass flow had negative feedback on OM accumulation and preservation during the C-S, which resulted in well-developed water column oxygen content. This, in turn, oxidized OM and led to deposition of OM-poor facies and CORBs in large parts of the Late Cretaceous oceans.\n               ","109":"\n                  Climate change is taking place due to significant emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. CO2 storage in geological formations is a promising approach that can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from large emitters such as the steel and cement industries. However, effective storage in underground formations requires active trapping mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of leakage. Carbon mineralization is a trapping technique that can permanently store CO2 in reactive rocks such as basalt. Although this method has been known for a long time, only two pilot projects in Iceland and the USA practiced CO2 injection into basalts. This could be mainly due to the complexity of the interactions, the rapid carbon mineralization, and the difficulty to estimate the storage capacity in the long term. In this paper, we discuss different mechanisms and technical challenges of CO2 storage in igneous rocks and propose a selection criterion based on laboratory and field-scale experience. It appears that basalt is a suitable rock for rapid carbon mineralization given its worldwide distribution, vesicular texture, and favourable mineral composition, but the lack of effective monitoring techniques and the amount of water required for injection are two major challenges that need to be addressed.\n               ","110":"\n                  Soil's resistance to erosion or its susceptibility to resist detachment is a key parameter in the majority of soil erosion and sediment models. Although soil resistance is a function of both the intrinsic properties of soil and dynamic environmental variables (e.g., soil moisture), the influence of the latter is seldom explicitly incorporated in the definition of soil resistance. The significant and complex role of soil moisture content on erosion resistance is recognized by many studies, however, much of the emphasis regarding the role of soil moisture on sediment yield modeling has been on its impacts on runoff generation rather than on soil resistance. In this paper, we synthesize the existing state of knowledge on the processes and mechanisms by which moisture affects erosion resistance of soil, and highlight the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating this relation in sediment yield assessment models. Through a detailed analysis of literature, we find that dry soil has the lowest resistance to erosion and thus has a high erodibility, and erosion resistance increases (erodibility decreases) with increasing antecedent moisture content until a certain threshold. After this threshold is reached, soil resistance decreases with further increase in moisture content, and soils become more susceptible to erosion. Next, the study identifies the candidate variables that may be used to quantitatively represent the soil's resistance to erosion vis-\u00e0-vis moisture, and discuss the challenges in incorporating this relation in modeling frameworks. As a way forward, through a meta-analysis of published data, we develop an exemplar relation that could be used to represent the variation in erosion resistance with soil moisture content. We find that the parameters of such a relation vary significantly across soil types, thus raising the possibility for developing a soil-type based moisture-resistance relations. Overall, this review underscores the considerable impact of antecedent soil moisture on the erosion resistance of soils, and makes a case for integrating the influence of dynamic soil moisture content on erosion resistance into predictive modeling frameworks.\n               ","111":"\n                  The burst of Mars exploration in the past two decades has significantly improved our knowledge of the Martian atmosphere. A variety of complementary, multiannual observational records have revealed Earth-like cycling of dust and water through the Mars system, as well as hints of dynamical coupling between the lower, middle, and upper atmosphere involving deep convection, planetary waves, thermal tides, and gravity waves that can be analogous to, but sometimes very different from, coupling processes in the Earth's atmosphere. This review focuses on several essential coupling processes on Mars involving the dust\/water cycling and wave activity: (1) interaction between the dust cycle, water cycle and wave activity in the lower atmosphere; (2) the global meridional circulation and middle atmospheric polar warmings; and (3) vertical coupling throughout the atmosphere during dusty\/non-dusty conditions. Most of these processes have been studied with state-of-the-art numerical models validated with recent observations. In addition, we summarize several newly proposed hypotheses that potentially impact our understanding of major issues in planetary science such as atmospheric coupling, water escape, or mesospheric cloud formation. We find many similarities between wave-induced couplings on Earth and Mars and analogies between the Earth's water cycle and Mars's dust cycle, which provide insights into comparative studies of these two planets.\n               ","112":"\n                  Glacier retreat has caused the emergence of numerous moraine-dammed glacial lakes (MGL) over the last century which have become research foci in many mountain regions of the world. Outbursts of MGLs have caused destructive floods and debris flows, leading to numerous human casualties and significant material damage. The mountains of South-Eastern Kazakhstan have also become prone to lake outburst floods and related debris flows, specifically in the second half of the 20th century. This paper presents and reviews existing surveys and knowledge along with results of own investigations on the formation of MGLs and the characteristics of lake outburst floods and debris flows in the Kazakh part of Tien Shan. We suggest a workflow to identify the most dangerous types of lakes and provide information about their morphogenetic features and hazard criteria.\n                  The number of MGLs increased since the 1970s with more than 160 existing in 2018. Forty were identified as being dangerous. Forty-eight lake outbursts occurred since 1950 with all the documented events happened between end of June and end of August. The most dangerous outbursts were caused by ruptures in ice-cored moraine dams. Outbursts of nine MGLs caused disastrous debris flows, with some occurring repeatedly. The number of outbursts decreased since the year 2000 compared to 1970\u20132000. However, due to ongoing glacier retreat new lakes are forming at higher altitudes. Their greater potential energy makes possible future outbursts more dangerous. Re-evaluation of existing methods to calculate the water volume and peak discharge based on bathymetric measurements and observed outbursts revealed that the applied equations provide suitable approximations and allow supporting mitigation and prevention measures. Finally, the presentation of implemented measures to lower the water level using siphons or artificial flow channels shows that they can reduce the lake outburst hazards. However, they are associated with risks and financial costs and it needs to be carefully considered whether protection measures of the endangered areas are more cost effective.\n               ","113":"\n                  Early Cretaceous sedimentary basins on the South Atlantic continental margins of South America and Africa are closely related with the Gondwana break-up, and record coeval paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic, and biotic changes during the late Barremian\u2013Albian. The Sergipe-Alagoas Basin of northeastern Brazil contains one of the most complete Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic successions of the South Atlantic Ocean, including sedimentary and paleontological records nearly absent in nearby basins on the African\/Brazilian continental margins. Fossil-rich sedimentary successions from the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin have allowed to assess: (i) evolutionary stages of the early South Atlantic Ocean; (ii) paleobiogeography of marine incursions (Austral and\/or North Atlantic\/Tethyan influences); and (iii) local signatures of global-scale paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic, and biotic events. Here we provide an overview on fossil-based biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental studies of the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, from the first marine incursions in a continental setting, to fully open-marine conditions. Based on eight fossil groups (ammonites, calcareous nannofossils, echinoids, planktonic and benthonic foraminifera, ostracods, palynomorphs, and radiolarians) from 107 sites, we observed that the marine biota shows strong affinity with Tethyan Realm in the Aptian\u2013Albian interval, and provincialism\/endemism is likely tied to the early-stage development of the South Atlantic Ocean. Based on late Barremian\u2013late Albian lithological, paleontological, and geochemical data, we suggest three Sergipe-Alagoas Paleoenvironmental Stages (SAPSs): (i) continental conditions with possible episodic marine incursions (SAPS-1); (ii) transitional system, from continental to restricted-marine conditions (SAPS-2); (iii) transition from restricted- to open-marine conditions (SAPS-3). These local-scale evolutionary stages are correlated with early phases of the South Atlantic Ocean and major late Early Cretaceous paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic events.

This review article summarizes the available stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrological, geochronological, geochemical, tectonic, and paleomagnetic evidence on the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone and adjacent geological domains now at the heart of the Tibetan Plateau, with the final aim to reconstruct the history of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean from its birth to its growth and final demise. The vivid debate on these highly controversial geological issues touches on several key problems in plate tectonics, including the birth of an ocean, the nature of microcontinents and seamounts, the initiation of oceanic subduction, the implications of subduction polarity, and the timing of continental collision. Rifting between South Qiangtang and the Lhasa blocks took place in the Early to Middle Permian. The Bangong-Nujiang Ocean was still narrow in the Late Permian. The Triassic saw the rapid northward drift of South Qiangtang and active sea-floor-spreading in the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean, which reached a maximum north\u2013south width of ~4000\u00a0km in about 50 million years. In the Early Jurassic (~190\u2013180\u00a0Ma), Bangong-Nujiang oceanic lithosphere began to subduct northward. After some 30\u201340 million years of oceanic subduction, documented by arc magmatism and high-pressure metamorphic rocks, the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean closed its northern branch (the Dongqiao-Amdo ocean) in the latest Middle Jurassic (166\u2013163\u00a0Ma), when the Amdo and Dongkacuo microcontinents collided with South Qiangtang. The southern oceanic branch (the Beila-Nagqu ocean) closed in the latest Jurassic (150\u2013145\u00a0Ma) at the onset of collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks. Early Cretaceous (140\u2013120\u00a0Ma) syncollisional arc-type magmatism was widely distributed in the Lhasa-Qiangtang collisional zone. At earliest Late Cretaceous time, the complete demise of seaways and the transition to widespread deposition of continental red beds along the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone marked the onset of intracontinental convergence leading to initial uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.\n               ","115":"\n                  The diversification of animals during the Cambrian Period is one of the most significant evolutionary events in Earth\u2019s history. However, the sequence of events leading to the origin of \u2018modern\u2019 ecosystems and the exact temporal relationship between Ediacaran and Cambrian faunas are uncertain, as identification of the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary and global correlation through this interval remains problematic. Here we review the controversies surrounding global correlation of the base of the Cambrian and present new high-resolution biostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic and \u03b413C chemostratigraphic data for terminal Ediacaran to basal Cambrian strata in the Zavkhan Basin of Mongolia. This predominantly carbonate sequence, through the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations in southwestern Mongolia, captures a distinct, negative \u03b413C excursion close to the top of the Zuun-Arts Formation recognized as the BAsal Cambrian carbon isotope Excursion (BACE). In this location, the nadir of the BACE closely coincides with first occurrence of the characteristic early Cambrian protoconodont Protohertzina anabarica. Despite recent suggestions that there is an evolutionary continuum of biomineralizing animals across the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition, we suggest that this continuum is restricted to tubular forms, and that skeletal taxa such as Protohertzina depict \u2018true\u2019 Cambrian representatives that are restricted entirely to the Cambrian. Employing the first appearance of the trace fossil Treptichnus pedum to define the base of the Cambrian suffers significant drawbacks, particularly in carbonate settings where it is not commonly preserved. As T. pedum is the only proxy available to correlate the Cambrian Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) defined at Fortune Head, Newfoundland, we suggest that the GSSP be redefined elsewhere, in a new stratigraphic section that contains secondary markers that permit global correlation. We propose the nadir of the BACE as the favored candidate to define the base of the Cambrian. However, it is essential that the BACE be complemented with secondary markers. In many global sections the nadir of the BACE and the first occurrence of the genus Protohertzina are closely juxtaposed, as are the BACE and T. pedum. Hence these taxa provide essential biostratigraphic control on the BACE and increase potential for effective global correlation. We also recommend that an Auxiliary boundary Stratotype Section and Point (ASSP) be simultaneously established in order to incorporate additional markers that will aid global correlation of the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary. The BAY4\/5 section through the upper Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations yields key shelly fossils and \u03b413C values and is therefore an ideal candidate for consideration as the GSSP for the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary.\n               ","116":"\n                  The North China Craton (NCC) hosts the world's most typical example of \u201cdecratonic\u201d gold deposits including lode, porphyry, cryptoexplosive breccia, and skarn subtypes. The lithospheric structure in the ore fields show \u201ctriple-junctions\u201d of basement microblocks, zones of lithospheric thinning, and \u201chotspots\u201d with abnormal crustal heat flow. The basement rocks are dominantly composed of trondhjemite-tonalite-granodiorite (TTG) suite and amphibolites. The intermediate-felsic calc-alkaline plutons with crust-mantle mixed origin and formed under high oxygen fugacity, volatile-rich and moderately fractionated conditions, together with dyke swarms of diverse compositions are indicators for the gold mineralization. The mantle under the gold field shows metasomatic or juvenile \u201cEM2\u201d or \u201cEM2 + EM1\u201d characteristics. The gold deposits are closely associated with craton destruction, heterogenous reactivation, large-scale magmatic intrusion and eruption, and upwelling of voluminous ore-bearing fluids within a transitional tectonic regime. The presence of mantle-derived mafic rocks, mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) and amygdaloidal bodies, minerals rich in Te, Ni, Cr, Mg, C and N, He and stable isotopes with mantle signature, among other features, indicate that the ore-forming metals and fluids have mixed mantle and deep crustal origin. Gold deposits coexisting or closely associated with mafic dykes and crust-mantle-derived stocks indicate that the upwelling of ore-forming fluid and localization of the ore-materials were facilitated at least partly by the intrusion of deep magma. The spatial distributions of altered rocks with alkali-feldspar-hematite zone distal to the orebody (barren) and pyrite-phyllite (sericite) zone proximal to the ore (ore-bearing zone) indicate a marked physico-chemical interface at the final stage of evolution of the ore-forming fluid. The presence of wide alteration zone indicates that the ore-controlling faults were in a compressive stress state, whereas narrow alteration zone is generally associated with a tensile stress state. The cataclastic, poikilitic, interstitial and zonal textures displayed by the various stages of ore minerals are related to the impact of alternating local tectonic stress fields in the faults, as well as fault-valve mechanism. Intense gold mineralization is typically associated with the development of polymetallic sulfide minerals and complex mineral assemblages. The major gold mineralization is also commonly related with pyrite with xenomorphic or complex forms, rich in As, Se, and Te, with large unit cells, wide X-ray diffraction peaks, and high P\/(P\u00a0+\u00a0N) values corresponding to thermoelectric conductive type. Quartz grains formed in the main gold mineralization stage are generally fine grained and irregular, occasionally occurring as grain clusters, and showing complex thermoluminescence patterns with both high and low temperature peaks. Multiple rhythmic zones in quartz, pyrite or other ore minerals with various impurities in between the different zones indicate the pulses of ore fluid flow toward the upper part of the orebody. In contrast, minerals with few or no zones may indicate an ore-fluid reservoir typically in the middle to lower parts of orebody.\n               ","117":"\n                  The chemical and isotopic compositions of Precambrian Fe-rich chemical sedimentary rocks have figured prominently in discussions on the Fe biogeochemical cycle and redox conditions in the early Earth. Broad trends of decreasing \u03b456Fe values for Eoarchean to Paleoproterozoic iron formations (IFs) and jaspilites (hematite-chert) with decreasing age reflect a general increase in extent of oxidation of aqueous Fe(II) (Fe(II)aq) in marine environments, consistent with increasing oxygenation of surface environments, particularly since the Mesoarchean. Such trends may record a shift from anaerobic to aerobic oxidation, in part reflecting increasing nutrient abundances that follow increased emergence of continental crust. It is commonly proposed that the size of the biosphere in the early Archean was largely nutrient limited, specifically P limited. Highly positive \u03b456Fe values for Fe oxides in chemical sedimentary rocks deposited in open marine environments at this time are consistent with excess Fe(II)aq.\n                  Here, we present new data on Fe isotopes and trace element chemistry for 3.4\u20133.5\u00a0Ga jaspilites from the North Pole region of the Pilbara Craton, including the first example of a land-sea transition preserved in the lower Dresser Formation as jaspilite deposition in restricted basin and open-marine settings. A review of the possible mechanisms of Fe(II)aq oxidation in the early Archean - including O2 generated by oxygenic photosynthesis, UV photo-oxidation, or photoferrotrophy (anoxygenic photosynthesis) - suggests that the latter is most likely, in light of evidence for low-O2 contents and the strong role that silica plays in inhibiting abiologic Fe(II) oxidation. Y\u00a0+\u00a0REE contents of lower Dresser Formation jaspilites indicate a freshwater component in the restricted basin settings, in contrast to exclusively seawater components in the open-marine environments. \u03b456Fe values for open-marine jaspilites are highly positive (\u03b456Fe\u00a0~\u00a0+1 to +2.4\u2030), similar to other jaspilites and IFs of Eoarchean to Paleoarchean age. Assuming photoferrotrophy as the oxidative pathway, this would indicate electron donor (Fe(II)aq) excess and nutrient limitation. For the restricted-basin jaspilites of the lower Dresser Formation, \u03b456Fe values extend to slightly negative values (\u03b456Fe\u00a0~\u00a0\u22120.4\u2030), correlating with changes in Y\u00a0+\u00a0REE contents that indicate fluid mixing. In toto, there is a range of ~3\u2030 in \u03b456Fe values across the land-sea transition of the lower Dresser Formation, significantly exceeding the range previously measured in early Archean jaspilites. Combined with an advection-dispersion-reaction model for Fe(II)aq oxidation via photoferrotrophy, these observations suggest a range of nutrient abundance with environment, where samples from near-shore or restricted settings record excess nutrients from terrestrial input and hence electron donor limitation.\n                  Integrating the new results from the Pilbara Craton with the broader Fe isotope database for Eoarchean through Paleoarchean jaspilites and IFs, as well as a simple mass-balance model relating \u03b456Fe values and P contents, it becomes apparent that the relatively high nutrient abundance seen only in restricted settings at ~3.5\u00a0Ga becomes more characteristic of the open oceans by ~3.2\u00a0Ga. This expansion of nutrient availability is correlated with a marked increase in 87Sr\/86Sr ratios for seawater, which can be shown to be a proxy for P delivery to the open oceans from the continents via weathering fluxes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of considering geologic context in interpreting Fe isotope and chemical compositions of jaspilites and IFs. Capture of the land-sea transition of the lower Dresser Formation provides insights into the biosphere that would have been missed in sample suites that only record open-marine conditions.\n               ","118":"\n                  Although the study of microplastics in the aquatic environment incorporates a diversity of research fields, it is still in its infancy in many aspects while comparable topics have been studied in other disciplines for decades. In particular, extensive research in sedimentology can provide valuable insights to guide future microplastics research. To advance our understanding of the comparability of natural sediments with microplastics, we take an interdisciplinary look at the existing literature describing particle properties, transport processes, sampling techniques and ecotoxicology. Based on our analysis, we define seven research goals that are essential to improve our understanding of microplastics and can be tackled by learning from natural sediment research, and identify relevant tasks to achieve each goal. These goals address (1) the description of microplastic particles, (2) the interaction of microplastics with environmental substances, (3) the vertical distribution of microplastics, (4) the erosion and deposition behaviour of microplastics, (5) the impact of biota on microplastic transport, (6) the sampling methods and (7) the microplastic toxicity. When describing microplastic particles, we should specifically draw from the knowledge of natural sediments, for example by using shape factors or applying methods for determining the principal dimensions of non-spherical particles. Sediment transport offers many fundamentals that are transferable to microplastic transport, and could be usefully applied. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the role of transport modes, the influence of biota on microplastic transport, and the importance and implementation of the dynamic behaviour of microplastics as a result of time-dependent changes in particle properties in numerical models. We give an overview of available sampling methods from sedimentology and discuss their suitability for microplastic sampling, which can be used for creating standardised guidelines for future application with microplastics. In order to comprehensively assess the ecotoxicology of microplastics, a distinction must be made between the effects of the polymers themselves, their physical form, the plastic-associated chemicals and the attached pollutants. This review highlights areas where we can rely on understanding and techniques from sediment research - and areas where we need new, microplastic-specific knowledge - and synthesize recommendations to guide future, interdisciplinary microplastic research.\n               ","119":"\n                  In comparison with the amount of study undertaken on the end-Permian mass extinction, the preceding Guadalupian mass extinction has received little investigation, even though it marks a significant biotic turnover associated with global environmental changes. During the earlier event, reef carbonate production shut down and was replaced by siliceous, mud-rich deposits (SRDs) in South China. However, changes in carbonate platform productivity during this epoch remain to be clarified. This paper presents sedimentological and conodont biostratigraphic investigations on the Guadalupian SRDs developed on the Yangtze Carbonate Platform (YCP) in central Guizhou. The findings are viewed in the context of Guadalupian sequence correlation of South China successions, which shows that the integrity of the YCP failed to match the platform tectonic evolution. The platform evolution saw the onset of major intra-platform depressions and the gradual onlap by SRDs along the platform margin. Stratigraphic correlation reveals that the platform experienced three phases of onlap by SRDs during the early Roadian, the late Wordian and the late Capitanian upwards. Platform carbonates re-expanded their extent following the first two phases, but not during the final phase. An evolutionary model is proposed for the Guadalupian carbonate platform, which follows the contemporaneous eustatic sea-level fluctuations. The partial drowning observed within the platform interior and increasing retreat along the platform margin could suggest an insufficient carbonate sediment supply shedding from the platform top during the Guadalupian. The variation in carbonate productivity raises our attention to the change in shallow-water carbonate factories, which is closely related to the fortunes of carbonate-secreting biota and environmental factors impacting the carbonate platform producers during the Guadalupian.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Tibetan Plateau, the largest and highest landmass on Earth, is known as the \u2018water tower\u2019 of Asia because of its crucial importance as a water resource for billions of people (Qiu, 2008; Immerzeel et al., 2010). It is also important for triggering the onset of monsoon circulation by increasing the insolation-driven thermal contrast between land and ocean (Prell and Kutzbach, 1992; Liu and Dong, 2013). The climate of the Tibetan Plateau is sensitive not only to global climate changes (Pepin et al., 2015), but it is also of great significance for the climate of Asia (Wu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2018). Against the background of ongoing anthropogenic global warming, the climate, vegetation, glaciers, lakes, and other landscape attributes of the Tibetan Plateau have experienced rapid and pronounced changes during the past few decades (e.g., Liu and Chen, 2000; Yao et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), accompanied by the increasing probability of the occurrence of various geohazards (e.g., K\u00e4\u00e4b et al., 2018; Chai et al., 2020). Because of its impact on large-scale atmospheric circulation and its close linkage with human welfare, the Tibetan Plateau is a key region for environmental and climatic research (Chen et al., 2020). Understanding long-term climate change and its forcing mechanisms on the Tibetan Plateau can provide insights into the functioning of low-latitude climate systems, and hence enable the formulation of improved strategies for addressing climate-related problems and improving predictions of future climate change in the region.\nIt has been proposed that the interactions between the monsoon and the westerlies dominate climatic and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau (Schiemann et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2012), and the interactions and the role of the two atmospheric systems on different timescales are well studied. During the past few decades, against the background of global warming and decreasing monsoon intensity, the southern monsoon-dominated region of the plateau has undergone large-scale glacier retreat (Yao et al., 2012), widespread regression of lakes (Zhang et al., 2019), and delayed green-up dates (Shen et al., 2015); conversely, stable or even increasing glacial volumes, significant lake expansion, and an advance in green-up dates were observed in the northern westerlies-dominated region of the plateau. Dipolar moisture patterns are also evident in tree-ring records between the northern and southern plateau regions during the past five and a half centuries (Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, it is suggested that there was an out-of-phase or anti-phased relationship of lake-level variations between the southwestern and northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene (Chen et al., 2020), because most of the lakes in the southern plateau reached their highest lake levels during the early Holocene (e.g., Chen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Rades et al., 2013; Hudson et al., 2015), while lower lake levels occurred at Lake Qinghai in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the early Holocene (e.g., Liu et al., 2015b; Wang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020b). On orbital timescales, the climate and environment of the Tibetan Plateau were controlled by the westerlies during the last glacial and dominated by the monsoon during the Holocene (e.g., An et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015).\nBased on records from various archives from the monsoon-dominated southern Tibetan Plateau, a long-term decreasing trend of monsoon intensity during the Holocene, tracking Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, is well documented (e.g., Bird et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2021a, 2021b). This trend was interrupted by several cooling events with different onset times and durations, although the events are not evident in all areas of the Tibetan Plateau (Fontes et al., 1996; Wrozyna et al., 2012). Numerous studies of lake sediments from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau have revealed that the region was controlled by the Asian summer monsoon, at least since the early Holocene (e.g., Shen et al., 2005; An et al., 2012; Qiang et al., 2013; Herzschuh et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2020). However, one study showed that during the Holocene the monsoon could only reach the Kunlun Mountains which form a northern barrier to its incursion (e.g., Ramisch et al., 2016); and W\u00fcnnemann et al. (2018) proposed that the modern climatic domains on the Tibetan Plateau reported by Yao et al. (2013) most likely existed over the last 14 kyr, even during intervals with a positive water balance. Also, based on a compound-specific hydrogen isotope record from Linggo Co in the central Tibetan Plateau, it is suggested that the westerlies likely dominated the northern Tibetan Plateau during the middle to late Holocene (Hou et al., 2017). Based on all available paleoclimatic records from the Tibetan Plateau it appears that although the monsoon dominated most of the plateau during the Holocene, its precise northern extent and the spatial pattern during the Holocene are not yet fully understood.\nThe uncertainty regarding the northern extent and spatial variation of the monsoon on the Tibetan Plateau is caused mainly by the uneven distribution of paleoclimatic records, as most of them are from the southern and northeastern parts and few are from the northern and inner plateau. Moreover, proxies that can distinguish the summer monsoon and the westerlies are lacking. Most of the proxies used in lacustrine studies only reflect the local environment or hydroclimatic changes in response to variations of the monsoon or the westerlies. For example, it has been found that high temperatures induced a dry climate in the basins of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the early to middle Holocene, although the summer monsoon was strong and supplied abundant precipitation at this time (Wu et al., 2020).\nStable oxygen isotopes (\u03b418O) in precipitation are an integrated tracer of atmospheric processes worldwide (Dansgaard, 1964; Craig and Gordon, 1965). A study of precipitation \u03b418O over the Tibetan Plateau based on station monitoring data and different models showed that the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation \u03b418O have three distinct domains: 1) a domain dominated by the influence of the westerlies (northern Tibetan Plateau); 2) a domain dominated by the Indian monsoon (southern Tibetan Plateau); and 3) a transitional domain in between the first two (Yao et al., 2013). Therefore, precipitation \u03b418O can be used to interpret paleoclimate records and in the application of atmospheric simulations to quantify paleoclimate changes, especially the spatial and temporal variations of different atmospheric circulation systems on the Tibetan Plateau.\nLakes are widely distributed on the Tibetan Plateau and their sedimentary records are ideal archives for reconstructing climatic and environmental changes. Changes in the \u03b418O composition of the continuously precipitated carbonate deposits document local temporal hydroclimate variations (Wei and Gasse, 1999). In the present study, we synthesize the evidence of 20 lacustrine \u03b418O records and 2 speleothem \u03b418O records from the Tibetan Plateau, and we use them to discuss the spatial and temporal variations of the summer monsoon on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive assessment of the spatial variation of the monsoon and the hydroclimatic variability of the various regions of the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene, from an isotopic perspective.\n\n\n2\nGeographic and climatic background of the Tibetan Plateau\nAs the heart of Asia and the roof of the world (Sykes, 1925), the Tibetan Plateau is the largest and highest plateau on Earth. It stretches from the foot of the Himalayas in the south to the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and the Qilian Mountains in the north, and from the Hindu Kush Mountains and the Pamir Plateau in the west, to the eastern foot of the Hengduan Mountains in the east (Zhang et al., 2021a). The average elevation is 4320\u00a0m, and the total area is 3.532\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0km2, with 83.7% in China (Zhang et al., 2021a; Fig. 1A). Lakes are extensively and densely distributed across the Tibetan Plateau, with a total area of \u223c5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0km2 (in 2018) (Zhang et al., 2019). The climate of the Tibetan Plateau is cold and dry in winter and cool and humid in summer. Based on meteorological records in China, the annual mean air temperature between 1979 and 2018 was \u22126\u00a0\u2212\u00a08\u00a0\u00b0C, and the annual mean precipitation was 100\u2013800\u00a0mm (He et al., 2020). Both the annual temperature and precipitation show a generally decreasing trend from the southeast to northwest (Fig. 1B). Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau peaks in summer and accounts for 60% of the annual total, following the typical monsoon pattern (Conroy and Overpeck, 2011).\nThe modern atmospheric circulation pattern over the Tibetan Plateau is characterized by the influence of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) in summer and of the westerlies in winter; the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) also influences the climate on the eastern margin of the plateau (Yao et al., 2012). Since the 1990s, the stable oxygen isotope ratio in precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau has been monitored at >20 stations, including those of the TNIP (Tibetan Network for Isotopes in Precipitation) and GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation). Precipitation \u03b418O shows clear spatial differences across the Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 1B). It begins to abruptly decrease in May, with the largest depletion in August in the monsoon domain (southern part), attributable to the shifting moisture origin between the Bay of Bengal and the southern Indian Ocean (Tian et al., 2001, 2007; Yu et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2013). In the northern Tibetan Plateau, the seasonal variation of precipitation \u03b418O is mainly controlled by temperature (Yao et al., 2013). A more complicated pattern of \u03b418O variations occurs in the transitional domain located between 30\u00b0N and 35\u00b0N (Yao et al., 2013).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nIsotope data\nTwenty published lacustrine carbonate \u03b418O records from the Tibetan Plateau were collected for integrating. Detailed information about the records, including location, modern lake level altitude, lake and catchment areas, lake hydrology and the corresponding \u03b418O records are listed in Table 1\n, and the site locations are shown in Fig. 1A. All the lacustrine \u03b418O records are based on measurements of chemically or biologically precipitated authigenic carbonate minerals, including calcite and aragonite. Although calcite and aragonite have different \u03b418O values, with the \u03b418O of aragonite being \u223c0.6 \u2030 more enriched than that of calcite precipitated under the same conditions (Leng and Marshall, 2004), the mineralogical effects on \u03b418O were corrected (e.g., for Ahung Co), or ignored due to the minor proportion of aragonite (e.g., Aweng Co, Lake Tso Moriri, Nam Co). Additionally, species-specific differences in \u03b418O values of ostracods caused by vital effects have been assessed (e.g., Mischke et al., 2010a). The consistent trend and similar absolute values of the \u03b418O records of fine-grained carbonates and ostracod shells indicate the limited influence of vital effects during the Holocene (e.g., Liu et al., 2007; An et al., 2012). All the isotope data are the originally measured values, except for the digitized records of Linggo Co, Chibuzhang Co, Bangong Co, Tangra Yunmco, Siling Co, Zigetang Co, Lake Hurleg, and Lake Qinghai. The quality of individual records in terms of sampling resolution and analytical error are discussed in the original publications. We used the original age models, except for the records from Bangong Co and Siling Co, the age models of which were updated based on calendar dates and corrected for the calculated reservoir effects (e.g., Hou et al., 2017). Additionally, the age-depth model of the sediment core from Donggi Cona was rebuilt based on AMS 14C dates, using a smoothing spline function in the Clam library, implemented with the \u201cR\u201d package (Blaauw, 2010; Reimer et al., 2020), as the original record was plotted against depth (Mischke et al., 2010a, 2010b). It should be noted that potential dating errors may exist in some records with dates from bulk organic matter. Although the records are of varying temporal resolution and time span, they still have the potential to assess the long-term characteristics of climatic and hydrological variations. Based on the spatial distribution of the selected lakes on the plateau, the \u03b418O records are divided into three groups: northeastern, central, and western, which are described below.\n\n\n3.2\n\u03b418O records from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau\nEight lacustrine \u03b418O records are from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Lake Qinghai, China's largest inland lake, is a closed saline lake mainly supplied by precipitation and meltwater. \u03b418O records from Lake Qinghai covering the whole Holocene have been reported from bulk carbonates (Liu et al., 2018), fine-grained carbonates (<63\u00a0\u03bcm) (Liu et al., 2018), and ostracod shells (Zhang et al., 1989; Lister et al., 1991; Liu et al., 2007; An et al., 2012; Li and Liu, 2017); all these \u03b418O records show similar long-term variations (Chen et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2020b). Among these records, we selected the ostracod \u03b418O record from core 1F which has robust age control and the highest sampling resolution (An et al., 2012; Li and Liu, 2017). Lake Dalianhai and Lake Genggahai, in the Gonghe Basin, are freshwater lakes but with no outlets (Qiang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020). \u03b418O analyses for Lake Genggahai were performed on mollusk shells, plant stem encrustations, and fine-grained (<38\u00a0\u03bcm) carbonates; the \u03b418O records from these different carbonate components show a strikingly similar pattern of variation, except for the last 1.5 kyr when the \u03b418O values from fine-grained carbonates were depleted and are different from the other two records (Qiang et al., 2017). Considering that the detrital carbonate content increased substantially during the last 1.5 kyr and that the influences of kinetic effects on the \u03b418O values of organisms was negligible during the Holocene (Qiang et al., 2017), we selected the \u03b418O record from encrustations in Lake Genggahai. The stable isotope values for Lake Dalianhai were generated from measurements of fine-grained (<63\u00a0\u03bcm) carbonate (Wu et al., 2020).\nLake Hala is a closed basin in the western part of the Qilian Mountains in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The lake is fed mainly by glacier meltwater and local rainfall (Yan and W\u00fcnnemann, 2014). Stable isotope analyses were conducted on ostracod shells from core H7, covering the period from the Lateglacial to the early Holocene, with a very low sampling resolution, as well as from bulk carbonates from cores H8 and H12 (Yan and W\u00fcnnemann, 2014). The \u03b418O values of bulk carbonates from the two cores since \u223c6\u00a0ka are similar but show opposite trends during the early Holocene, because of the influences of a debris flow in core H12, as suggested by the authors; therefore, we selected the \u03b418O record from core H8. Lake Hurleg is a freshwater and open lake fed mainly by the Bayin River from the northern mountains. The \u03b418O record is derived from stable isotope analyses of bulk carbonate (calcite) and ostracods and they show a similar trend (Zhao et al., 2010); we selected the high-resolution \u03b418O record from calcite for the present study. The records for Lake Koucha, Lake Kuhai, and Lake Donggi Cona are based on stable isotope analyses of ostracod shells and the final values of \u03b418O from different ostracod species were corrected for the species-specific differences (Mischke et al., 2008, 2010a, 2010b). However, a more accurate bulk carbonate \u03b418O record with higher resolution from Lake Kuhai was selected in this study (W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2018). For Lake Koucha, stable isotope analyses were performed on bulk carbonates; however, we observed that the bulk carbonate and ostracod records show opposite trends during the early to middle Holocene and the authors suggested that the difference was caused by temperature differences (Mischke et al., 2008).\n\n\n3.3\n\u03b418O records from the central Tibetan Plateau\nEight lacustrine \u03b418O records are from the central Tibetan Plateau. Lake Bande is a shallow fresh water body adjacent to the Tuotuo River in the upper reaches of the Yangtse River. Lake Bande is an open lake fed mainly by precipitation and runoff and there are no glaciers in the catchment; the \u03b418O record is based on fine-grained authigenic calcite (Li et al., 2022). Linggo Co is near the base of the western slope of the Puruogangri glacier, the largest icefield on the Tibetan Plateau; it is a freshwater lake fed mainly by glacier meltwater and precipitation (He et al., 2016). Stable isotope analysis was performed on ostracod shells. Chibuzhang Co is a brackish water, seasonally lake, and ostracod shells were used for \u03b418O analysis (Dong et al., 2021). Tangra Yumco is a brackish water body lacking an outflow and is currently a terminal lake (Kasper et al., 2021); the lake is fed mainly by precipitation. Glaciers cover only 1% of the lake's catchment and make only a limited contribution to the lake water volume (G\u00fcnther et al., 2016). For Siling Co, bulk carbonates were used for stable isotope analysis (Morinaga et al., 1993). Zigetang Co is a closed saline lake and its \u03b418O record was obtained from ostracod shells (Zhang et al., 2014). Ahung Co is a small freshwater lake with water supplied by streams from the surrounding wetland. \u03b418O values of bulk carbonate were obtained and corrected for the dolomite content (Morrill et al., 2006). Nam Co is a saline lake, with glacier meltwater providing the main water source. Ostracod shells (Wrozyna et al., 2012) and bulk carbonate samples (Kasper et al., 2021) were used for \u03b418O measurements, and the latter record was selected here due its greater length.\nIn addition, Taro Co is fed mainly by the Buduo River, which is sourced from glacial meltwater from the Gangdise Mountains in the southern part of the catchment; stable isotope values were generated from measurements of ostracod shells (Guo et al., 2016). During times of high lake level, the water from Taro Co flows along a river channel into the hypersaline Lake Zabuye (Zabuye Salt Lake) on its northern side (Guo et al., 2016 and references therein). The \u03b418O record from Taro Co was used for comparison with the other records but it was excluded from the composite record due to its low resolution. Peiku Co is a brackish water lake and its \u03b418O record is from ostracods (Du, 2012); however, the record was also excluded from the composite record because it has no absolute chronology and the \u03b418O record was used to establish an age model by comparing it with the oxygen isotope record from Dongge Cave in southern China (Du, 2012).\n\n\n3.4\n\u03b418O records from the western Tibetan Plateau\nFour lacustrine isotopic records are from the western Tibetan Plateau. Aweng Co is a closed saline lake. Glaciers and snow at higher elevations occur in the western part of the catchment, providing \u223c50% of the water supply to the lake. \u03b418O values were measured on fine-grained carbonate and ostracod shells (Zhang et al., 2021b). Bangong Co comprises a chain of five basins separated by shallow sills and the lake is mainly supplied by surface runoff inflowing from the easternmost basin (Fontes et al., 1996). Bangong Co is presently closed but from the beginning of the Holocene until 1.2\u00a0ka it was open with a potential outflow at its western extremity (Fontes et al., 1996). It is also fed by meltwater from the Mawang glacier. Stable isotope analyses were performed on fine-grained (<40\u00a0\u03bcm) authigenic carbonates (Fontes et al., 1996). Guozha Co is a proglacial, open lake located \u223c20\u00a0km south of the glaciers and is fed by meltwater and discharges into the Aksai Chin Lake to the west (Li et al., 2021). Fine-grained carbonate components were used for stable isotope analyses. Lake Tso Moriri is fed by precipitation and small glacial streams and the lake has a permanent outlet. Bulk carbonates were used for stable isotope analysis (Mishra et al., 2015). In addition, Sumxi Co is in the rain shadow of the Kunlun and Karakorum mountains in the western Tibetan Plateau; it is a small freshwater, closed lake, supplied mainly by meltwater from the Mawang glacier and local rainfall (Gasse et al., 1991). The \u03b418O values of bulk authigenic carbonates were measured and are reported in Gasse et al. (1991) and Wei and Gasse (1999). Considering the difference between the two datasets and the uncertainty of the chronology, we excluded the \u03b418O record from Sumxi Co.\n\n\n3.5\nData processing\nThe original and digitized isotopic records were linearly interpolated to a 100-year time step and the new \u03b418O time series were then normalized using z-scores, as follows:\n\n\n\nx\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere x\n\u2217 is the normalized value, x are interpolated isotope values, and \u03bc and \u03c3 are the average and standard deviation of the individual interpolated data series, respectively. Finally, the normalized values (x\n\u2217) of the different records were averaged and the standard deviation was also calculated.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStatistical summary of the \u03b418O records from the Tibetan Plateau\nThe Holocene carbonate oxygen isotope values for the 20 selected lakes from the Tibetan Plateau are illustrated as a box plot (Fig. 2\n). The values vary from \u221213\u2030 to 6\u2030, with the maximum range of variation of \u223c10\u2030 for the whole Holocene. From the southern to the northern parts of the plateau, the isotopic values show an overall increasing trend with relatively depleted values in the southern part, slightly increasing values in the central part, and enriched values in the northern part, which resembles the spatial distribution of modern precipitation isotope values (JJA and annual) on the Tibetan Plateau. This trend is also consistent with the variation of the elevation of the sites. As the central Tibetan Plateau consists of large, flat plateau surface, the lakes from the region between 31\u00b0and 35\u00b0 N have depleted and variable values. Therefore, a spatial differentiation of the isotopic composition on the Tibetan Plateau existed during the Holocene. In addition, large lakes, such as Lake Qinghai and Selling Co, usually have more enriched isotopic values; while the smaller lakes, including Ahung Co, Lake Bande, Lake Genggahai and Lake Dalianhai, have relatively depleted isotopic values.\n\n\n4.2\nSpatial and temporal characteristics of the \u03b418O records\nThe 20 isotopic records were divided into three types based on the overall temporal trends of variation during the Holocene, as follows. Type 1 (Fig. 3A-L) comprises records from Lake Bande, Linggo Co, Chibuzhang Co, Guozha Co, Aweng Co, Bangong Co, Lake Tso Moriri, Tangra Yumco, Siling Co, Zigetang Co, Ahung Co, and Nam Co, which are in the central and western Tibetan Plateau. In this case, the \u03b418O values decrease at the beginning of the Holocene and maintain their lowest values during the early Holocene, followed by an increasing trend during the middle to late Holocene; however, some of the records do not cover the entire Holocene (e.g., Lake Bande, Guozha Co, and Ahung Co), and it is also evident that the \u03b418O records from Guozha Co and Bangong Co show abrupt changes during the last 1\u20132 kyr. Type 2 (Fig. 3R-T) comprise records from Lake Hala, Lake Qinghai, and Lake Koucha, which are in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. These records have lower isotopic values during the early Holocene which then increase sharply during the middle Holocene and maintain relatively high values after 5\u00a0ka BP. Type 3 (Fig. 3M-Q) comprises records from Lake Hurleg, Lake Genggahai, Lake Dalianhai, Lake Donggi Cona, and Lake Kuhai, from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. This type is quite different from other two, with the records having variable isotopic values during the early to middle Holocene and lower values with frequent fluctuations since \u223c5\u00a0ka.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\n\u03b418O values of modern precipitation as an indicator of water sources on the Tibetan Plateau\nBased on an analysis of precipitation isotope monitoring data, Yao et al. (2013) proposed three different spatial patterns of precipitation \u03b418O on the plateau. They argued that precipitation \u03b418O generally increases northward across the Tibetan Plateau at the rate of 0.69\u2030\/\u00b0N, with the spatial gradient being more pronounced in summer (JJA) than in winter (DJF) (Yao et al., 2013). Additionally, other studies show that both surface waters and soil carbonates display a northward increase in \u03b418O values of \u223c1.5\u2030\/\u00b0N, in the Himalayan crest, despite only a minor increase in elevation (Quade et al., 2011). However, the spatial gradient of winter precipitation \u03b418O shows the opposite trend of a slight northward decrease (Fig. 4\n). As shown in Fig. 4, the variations of the annual mean \u03b418O of precipitation from TNIP and GNIP are consistent with changes in precipitation \u03b418O in JJA, but they are different from the precipitation \u03b418O in DJF, indicating that summer precipitation may dominate the annual variation of precipitation \u03b418O. It is accepted that most of the precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau occurs during the summer as rainfall, except for the regions of the Pamir Plateau and the Karakorum\u2212West Kunlun Mountains where precipitation falls as snow (Maussion et al., 2014). For example, for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, instrumental records from the Gangcha and Delingha meteorological stations show that \u223c65% and 60%, respectively, of the precipitation falls during the period from June to August. Even for the central Kunlun Mountains in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau, the summer precipitation peak is also distinct, contributing 70% to the annual total in model data (Jia, 2015). However, there are differences in the timing of the summer monsoon incursion across the plateau. For the Lake Qinghai region, on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the moisture is derived predominantly from the EASM from June to August, with the transition between the EASM and the westerlies occurring in June and September (Cui and Li, 2015), whereas the much earlier influence of the summer monsoon was detected in Lhasa in the southern Tibetan Plateau (Yu et al., 2008).\nThe summer monsoon rains from the Western Pacific have more enriched \u03b418O values compared to those from the Indian Ocean, while locally derived air masses embedded in the westerly jet stream usually have more depleted \u03b418O values (Aragu\u00e1s-Aragu\u00e1s et al., 1998). In winter, the westerlies prevail over the whole Tibetan Plateau, with no obvious variation of precipitation from south to north (Yao et al., 2013). Marine air masses transported from the southwest cannot directly reach the northern Tibetan Plateau (Tian et al., 2001). Continental recycling of this moisture involves evaporation over the land surfaces which leads to more enriched summer precipitation \u03b418O values (Tian et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2008). Therefore, the \u03b418O signal of meteoric water is an important tracer of the regional hydrological cycle, past changes in which can be tracked via changes in the \u03b418O composition of lacustrine carbonates (Wei and Gasse, 1999; Yu et al., 2009).\n\n\n5.2\nFactors influencing the isotopic composition of authigenic carbonate in lake sediments\nAuthigenic carbonate minerals precipitate in isotopic equilibrium with lake water and the oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of these minerals can be used to infer climatic and hydrological variations in the lake catchment (e.g., Wu et al., 2018). The \u03b418O values of authigenic carbonate is determined by the temperature and isotopic composition of the water at the time of precipitation (Craig and Gordon, 1965; Leng and Marshall, 2004). The temperature-dependent equilibrium isotopic fractionation between carbonate and water is approximately \u22120.24\u2030 per \u00b0C (Craig and Gordon, 1965). The large range of variability in the oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonate during the Holocene strongly suggests that isotope values are only to a limited extent controlled by temperature, as the summer temperature variation during the Holocene on the Tibetan Plateau was likely limited to within 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (Chen et al., 2020). Therefore, the variations in authigenic carbonate \u03b418O were mainly controlled by fluctuations in the oxygen isotopic composition of the lake water, which in turn was governed by the isotopic composition of precipitation, evaporation from the lake surface and catchment, residence time of the lake water, and possible meltwater from Tibetan glaciers (Leng and Marshall, 2004; Zhang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2018; W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2018). In summary, considering the large range of variation of the \u03b418O values during the Holocene, the records provide information about the oxygen isotopic composition of the lake water rather than about temperature variations.\n\n\n5.3\nMajor factors controlling the isotopic composition of specific lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene\nThe isotopic composition of lake water can be influenced by many factors, as mentioned above. It is important to evaluate each lake, because of differences in surface area, catchment area, and the hydrological system. Small lakes or hydrologically-open systems (e.g., Ahung Co, Lake Bande, Lake Genggahai, Lake Dalianhai and Bangong Co) usually have more depleted \u03b418O values as they can be more easily affected by precipitation given the limited residence time of the water. For example, Lake Qinghai is a closed lake with a large surface area and the water residence time is \u223c33\u00a0years (Lister et al., 1991), while Bangong Co is open and has a much shorter residence time (e.g., estimated as 6\u00a0years) (Fontes et al., 1996). This results in more enriched and more depleted \u03b418O values for the two lakes, respectively, besides the fact that they are in different regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, for lakes supplied by glaciers, the \u03b418O value of meltwater is much more depleted than the lake water (e.g., Aweng Co; Zhang et al., 2021b), which means that an increasing meltwater supply leads to depleted \u03b418O values. Although the influence of lake water on \u03b418O variations is therefore complicated, we can divide these influencing factors into two main categories: water input and water output. The influence of output on the lake water isotopic composition is more evident for closed lakes because of temperature-induced evaporation, which will increase the lake water \u03b418O and potentially cause long-term 18O enrichment. In the case of the input to a lake, the \u03b418O of Tibetan lakes is mainly influenced by precipitation or meltwater.\nThe contribution of lake water isotopes from glacial meltwater during the Holocene has been considered for lakes with glaciers distributed in their drainage systems (e.g., Mishra et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2021b); however, it is only proposed as a possible influencing factor and is not quantified. Recently, Li et al. (2021) attempted to use authigenic carbonate \u03b418O in proglacial lake Guozha Co as a proxy to quantitatively estimate the variation of glacial meltwater during the Holocene. The results indicated that more glacial meltwater fed the lake during the early to middle Holocene. However, the authors acknowledged that their calculation is based on a series of assumptions, including constant precipitation and evaporation, which have large uncertainties (Li et al., 2021); moreover, too many uncertainties exist to extend such estimates to all glaciers across the Tibetan Plateau (Li et al., 2021). Chen et al. (2020) summarized Holocene glacier activity based on a compilation of existing 10Be ages of Holocene moraines on the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding mountains. They found that the number of 10Be ages was relatively high for the interval of 10\u20137.5\u00a0ka and that the number of ages increased again from \u223c6\u00a0ka to the preindustrial period. The decrease in sample frequency with increasing age is likely caused by the preservation of moraines, as younger landforms are better preserved, more common, and easier to date (Owen et al., 2008). However, careful and systematic choice of sampling density, combined with high density sampling (e.g., 482 moraine 10Be ages are used to produce curve Fig. 5B), can minimize this potential source of error. Although the probability density curve of 10Be ages cannot accurately reflect the extent of a glacier advance (Owen et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2020), the dated moraines represent the former extent of glaciers, and the age roughly indicates the timing after glacier melting, which is regarded as evidence of glacier activity. Therefore, an increased number of moraines ages usually indicates enhanced glacier activity. Increased glacier activity after \u223c6\u00a0ka on the Tibetan Plateau is also supported by the ages from the base of ice cores from the Dunde ice cap and Puruogangri ice caps (Thompson et al., 2006), and from the base of the Chongce ice core (Hou et al., 2018). Additionally, numerical modeling results indicate that the extent of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau decreased rapidly and continuously after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and reached the minimum during the early Holocene, followed by a long-term increasing trend with a limited amplitude of variation during the middle to late Holocene (Yan et al., 2020a). It can be concluded that the modern glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau mainly accumulated since the middle Holocene, especially after the Little Ice Age, against the background of decreasing summer temperatures (Fig. 5B; Chen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022a).\nAlthough there was no ice sheet on the Tibetan Plateau during the LGM (Shi et al., 1992), the enhanced ice volume over the ice caps or high mountain regions and the corresponding melting during the following deglacial (e.g., the B\u00f8lling\u2013Aller\u00f8d Interstadial) would have fed the proglacial lakes, which would potentially lead to depleted lake water \u03b418O values, as in the case of Lake Qinghai during the Lateglacial (Liu et al., 2015b; Yan et al., 2020b). For the early Holocene, it is still difficult to accurately evaluate the isotopic contribution to lake water from glacier melting, because of the uncertainty regarding glacier volumes or extent and the timing of the melting of residual glaciers. It was suggested that the mass of all glaciers in High Mountain Asia will decrease by 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% by the end of this century, compared to 1996\u20132015, against the background of continued global warming (Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017), which indicates that the rate of glacier mass loss is much faster than was thought. Although it is possible that the extent of the residual glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau during the early to middle Holocene was limited, we cannot exclude the influence of meltwater on lake water isotope compositions during this period. Moreover, considering the enhanced glacier activity after 6\u00a0ka, the intensity of glacier melting and its corresponding influence on water isotopic composition could have been increasing during the middle to late Holocene.\nAmong the 22 investigated lakes in this study, including Peiku Co and Sumxi Co, there are 13 lakes whose modern hydrological systems are linked to glaciers in their drainage system; they are mainly distributed in the southern, western and central Tibetan Plateau. These Tibetan lakes have experienced large changes in water level during the Holocene, mainly in response to the precipitation (and\/or meltwater)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0evaporation balance. The early Holocene high lake levels and middle to late Holocene declining lake levels of Peiku Co (W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2015), Siling Co (Shi et al., 2017), Nam Co (Zhu et al., 2015), Tangra Yumco (G\u00fcnther et al., 2016), and Longmu Co (Liu et al., 2016) in the southern and western Tibetan Plateau, are well documented by sediment core records and paleo-shoreline deposits. A recent paleo-shoreline study found that the highest water levels of the mega-lakes on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau were formed by melting glaciers during the last deglacial under a dry climate, which is different to the early\u2212middle Holocene mega-lakes in other parts of the inner Tibetan Plateau (Zhang et al., 2022b). The early Holocene high level of lakes on the southern and western Tibetan Plateau are usually regarded as indicators of a strong ISM during this interval (e.g., Liu et al., 2019). Such a long-term scenario can be compared with hydroclimatic variations on the Tibetan Plateau on short timescales. For example, Zhang et al. (2020a) assessed numerous factors impacting lake-level changes on the Tibetan Plateau during the past several decades, and they found that enhanced net precipitation was the dominant contributor to increased lake water storage in the inner Tibetan Plateau and was much more important than glacial meltwater influx. However, the impact of glacier meltwater on lake levels and lake water isotope compositions during the Holocene should not be ignored. From the comparison of the Holocene carbonate \u03b418O values from Ahung Co and Zigetang Co, with no glacier meltwater supply, and \u03b418O values of other glacier-fed lakes in the central Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 2), it is evident that glacier lakes do not always have depleted \u03b418O values, indicating that besides glacier meltwater, other influencing factors, including lake size, elevation, and the hydrological conditions of lake basin, may also impact the water \u03b418O of a specific lake. It is also evident that non-glacier-fed lakes (e.g., Zigetang Co) had variable \u03b418O values across the entire Holocene, but very large fluctuations of the \u03b418O of glacier lakes occurred during the late Holocene. In addition, the long-term variations of \u03b418O for both glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes in the central and western Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene are consistent.\nGiven that the moisture sources of glaciers are closely linked with precipitation, we propose that meltwater mainly reflects the isotopic signal of the source moisture, or that of the precipitation during a certain interval, which is shorter than the millennial timescale during the Holocene. However, we cannot exclude a possible contribution from the melting of old glaciers. Taking the Qiangyong glacier on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau as an example, it was found that the melting of old glacier ice releases old pollen that subsequently affects the radiocarbon ages of pollen in proglacial lake sediments, resulting in the average age offset of \u223c2000\u00a0years during the last 2.5 kyr (Zhang et al., 2017). Thus, for the lakes investigated in this study, irrespective of whether a lake is fed by glacier meltwater or not, the consistent long-term variation of the averaged lake water oxygen isotopic composition of lakes within the same region was not controlled by meltwater during the Holocene, especially given that glacier volume and glacier ice with different ages could vary between different glaciers (e.g., Owen et al., 2008).\nEvaporation also plays an important role in controlling the isotopic composition of lake water, as indicated by the enriched \u03b418O values from closed lakes compared with hydrologically-open lakes in the same region. In terms of temporal variability, it has been suggested that the enriched \u03b418O values from Lake Hala during the early to middle Holocene were caused by strong evaporation (Yan et al., 2020b). This was also the case for Lake Dalianhai on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (Wu et al., 2020). In addition, lake elevation may influence its precipitation isotopic composition; and an increase in the elevation, which is closely linked with decreased temperature and enhanced convection process of moisture uplift, theoretically causes depleted \u03b418O values. However, the influence of elevation is a systemic difference and cannot account for the huge changes in the isotopic sequences; moreover, it is not evident under modern conditions (Quade et al., 2011).\nRegarding the influence of the westerlies, Qiang et al. (2017) proposed that the centennial-scale isotopic depletion during the Lateglacial and the late Holocene mainly reflects the intensification of the mid-latitude westerly circulation that transported substantially more moisture, with depleted \u03b418O values, to the region. W\u00fcnnemann et al. (2018) also proposed that depleted \u03b418O in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are not always linked with a strong ASM and was mainly attributed to water supply during non-summer seasons, with colder temperatures and generally light isotopic signatures from mid-latitude westerlies-derived sources. In a review of paleoclimatic records from the region from Central Asia to northwestern China, many lakes were found to be very shallow or even dry during the early Holocene, and that the effective moisture increased during the middle to late Holocene, indicating a strengthening of the westerlies circulation (Chen et al., 2008, 2019). If the westerlies are the sole influence on the isotopic composition of precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau, then the isotopic evidence will reflect this influence, with a depleted trend of isotopic values evident during the entire Holocene.\nThe lacustrine isotopic records from the Tibetan Plateau studied herein can be divided into three types, as discussed in Section 4.2. Type 1 records are from the western and central parts of the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that lakes in these regions experienced an overall continuous enrichment of water isotopes since the early Holocene (Fig. 5E). The records of types 2 and 3 are from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and both types show similar characteristics, with no long-term increasing trend during the second half of the Holocene (Fig. 5C&D). Regarding the three lakes with type 2 records, the depleted \u03b418O values during the early Holocene may indicate that these lakes have specific hydrological conditions. For example, it was suggested that the water level of Lake Qinghai during the early Holocene was much lower than that during the middle to late Holocene (e.g., Liu et al., 2015b; Wang et al., 2019), and thus the isotopic composition of the lake could be easily affected by precipitation or the melting of frozen soil and snow during the early Holocene because of the short residence time of the lake water (Liu et al., 2018). In addition, the melting of glaciers may also have contributed to the early Holocene depleted \u03b418O values of Lake Qinghai and Lake Hala (Yan and W\u00fcnnemann, 2014); and Lake Koucha potentially received substantial monsoon moisture during the period because of its southerly location. Type 3 records have variable \u03b418O values before 5\u00a0ka, followed by an overall decreasing trend afterwards (Fig. 5C). This indicates an increase in the moisture status of the basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the second half of the Holocene. A millennial-scale moisture dipolar pattern between the northeastern and other parts of the Tibetan Plateau is also evident in the lake level variations. Lakes in the southern, western, and central Tibetan Plateau experienced the highest lake levels during the early Holocene (Liu et al., 2016, 2019); however, lakes such as Lake Dalianhai (Wu et al., 2020), Lake Kuhai (W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018), and Lake Qinghai (Liu et al., 2015b), in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, had low water levels during the early Holocene and rising levels thereafter.\n\n\n5.4\nVariations of Holocene atmospheric circulations on the Tibetan Plateau and the spatial patterns of the hydroclimatic response\nPrecipitation \u03b418O monitoring data for the Tibetan Plateau indicate that only the regions south of 30\u00b0N are influenced by the monsoon system, while the northern and northeastern Tibetan Plateau are dominated by the westerlies (Yao et al., 2013). However, based on the amount and distribution of precipitation, and the vegetation cover, it is considered that the modern monsoonal region of the Tibetan Plateau includes the northeastern plateau, especially the Lake Qinghai and Qilian Mountains regions (Chen et al., 2008; An et al., 2012). This inconsistency may be the results of varying definitions of the monsoon.\nThe isotopic composition of precipitation is also documented by cave speleothems. The environmental significance of speleothem \u03b418O records has been intensively debated (e.g., Maher, 2008; Tan, 2014), focusing mainly on their fidelity as a record of EASM rainfall (Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015a, 2017, 2020). The variation among stalagmite \u03b418O records from eastern China is obviously different to the spatial pattern of precipitation amount in the region, and thus it has been suggested that the stalagmite \u03b418O records from eastern China cannot represent the intensity of the EASM (e.g., Maher, 2008; Liu et al., 2015a, 2017; Chen et al., 2016), and that the amount of precipitation in northern China can be used to represent the monsoon intensity (Chen et al., 2016). However, Cheng et al. (2019) argued that the spatial consistency of changes in monsoon intensity revealed by \u03b418O records reflects the \u2018wind\u2019 component of the monsoon, or the spatial scale of atmospheric circulation and associated changes in moisture sources. Although speleothem \u03b418O records are rare on the Tibetan Plateau, there are three published records: from Tianmen Cave (Cai et al., 2012; Fig. 6F), Bengle Cave (Han et al., 2017; Fig. 6D), and Xiannv Cave (Cai et al., 2008; An et al., 2012) (not shown here because of its short time span). Combined with the widely distributed lacustrine authigenic carbonate \u03b418O records, they provide valuable information for determining the consistency or inconsistency between the monsoon defined by isotopic composition and the monsoon defined by precipitation amount. (See Fig. 7.)\n\nMost of the precipitation in the region of the Tibetan Plateau where the selected lacustrine isotope records are distributed occurs during the summer, based on meteorological monitoring data and large-scale model-based data products. The so-called \u2018amount effect\u2019 on precipitation \u03b418O in the southern Tibetan Plateau is obvious, as well as in the central plateau. For example, isotope monitoring data from Tuotuohe station show that the precipitation \u03b418O in summer decreases with increasing rainfall (Yao et al., 2013). Even for the Qilian Mountains region, a tree ring\u2013based \u03b418O precipitation reconstruction compares well with the instrumental precipitation record on the decadal timescale during 1956\u20132011 (Yang et al., 2021), although a temperature influence on the seasonal variations of precipitation \u03b418O is evident, and tree ring cellulose also benefits from the supply of snowmelt, which is related to westerlies-supplied moisture.\nThe temporal distribution of Holocene precipitation on the southern, central, and western Tibetan Plateau is characterized by increasing precipitation during the early Holocene and decreasing precipitation during the middle to late Holocene (e.g., Zhang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020). Even for the northern Tibetan Plateau, a proxy record of lower temporal resolution from Lake Heihai documents the decreasing trend of the ISM during the Holocene (Fig. 6D; Ramisch et al., 2016), which resembles with the trend of the speleothem \u03b418O records from Tianmen Cave (Fig. 6G; Cai et al., 2012) and Bengle Cave (Fig. 6E; Han et al., 2017), tracking the variation of summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 6H; Laskar et al., 2004). On longer timescales, the variation of Holocene moisture sources on the Tibetan Plateau is well documented by lacustrine \u03b418O records. The overall increasing trend of type 1 \u03b418O values (Fig. 6F) may be a response to the decrease of the summer monsoon during the Holocene. This inference is supported by the fact that the carbonate contents of the sediments of most of the lakes in the central and western Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Bande, Chibuzhang Co, Guozha Co, Ahung Co, Nam Co,) show a negative correlation with the isotope composition during the Holocene; however, this is not the case for some lakes because of the potential influence of lake productivity variations. In contrast, a positive correlation between the two is evident for lakes Genggahai, Dalinahai, Donggi Cona, and Hala in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.\nFor the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, the variation of the summer monsoon was recorded in a calendar-year-dated tree-ring-based stable oxygen isotope record from the Delingha region (Yang et al., 2021). Although this isotopic monsoon record is controversial because of questions regarding the environmental significance of cellulose \u03b418O and the reality of the inferred climatic events (e.g., Weiss, 2022), the precipitation reconstruction shows a pronounced multi-millennial drying trend (Fig. 6A), which agrees with a pollen-based mean annual precipitation reconstruction from the Lake Qinghai basin (Fig. 6B; Lv et al., 2021). However, the hydrology of the basins in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau shows a different pattern. Moisture availability in these basins was low during the early Holocene and increased during the middle to late Holocene, as indicated by the slight depletion of the \u03b418O values from \u223c5\u00a0ka to the present (Fig. 6C), as well as by other geological evidence from the region, including paleosol development (e.g., Chen et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2021), lake-level variations (e.g., Liu et al., 2015b; Wu et al., 2020), and changes in the extent of grassland (e.g., the pollen Artemisia\/Chenopodiaceae (A\/C) ratio) (Liu, 2016).\nThe pronounced difference between the isotopic records from lake sediments versus the precipitation reconstructions in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau highlights the complex pattern of the hydrological processes of specific lakes, and\/or the uncertainty of the precipitation reconstructions. This inconsistency may be caused by the seasonal bias of the proxies; foe example, the trees (Qilian juniper) which are widely distributed on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau grow from May to August (Zhang et al., 2020b), when calcite is usually deposited under relatively warm water conditions (Leng and Marshall, 2004). Lakes usually have a very large watershed area compared with that of an individual tree, and thus the isotopic variations of the latter are potentially strongly influenced by summer rainfall, while lake water can be influenced by year-round precipitation. In addition to precipitation, temperature variations (especially the warm season temperature) could have influenced the vegetation variations reconstructed from pollen assemblages in this region during the Holocene. Alternatively, temperature may have dominated the variations in lake hydrology in the basins of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Wu et al., 2020).\nThe viewpoint of increasing moisture availability during the second half of the Holocene in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau has been proposed previously (e.g., Mischke et al., 2008, 2010a; W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020b, 2021). This increase in moisture availability mainly resulted from lower temperatures and evaporation but was probably also influenced by a complex range of factors, including the amount and timing of precipitation, and the altitudes of the lake basins and the upper reaches of the drainage systems (Mischke et al., 2010a). In addition, it was proposed that moisture from the westerlies and the EASM associated with the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) may have caused the middle to late Holocene lake-level\/moisture maximum in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (Chen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). However, the foregoing are only potential factors influencing precipitation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and they need to be fully assessed.\nUnder present-day climatic conditions, monsoon moisture can be transported to the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Against the background of decreasing summer monsoon precipitation amount and the enrichment of monsoon precipitation isotope values during the Holocene, the \u03b418O values of the type 3 records decreased and the type 2 records maintained lower values during the second half of the Holocene. This indicates the enhancement of the water supply, with more depleted \u03b418O values, to the region, except for the influence of the Asian summer monsoon. Given that the temperature variations are usually characterized by the large-spatial-scale consistency, the regional difference between the \u03b418O values of lake water cannot be attributed to the temperature induced evaporation. It has been suggested that the dominance of westerly-derived moisture may influence the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Qiang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2018, 2020b, 2021); and the melting of frozen soil and snow during the spring usually causes a small peak in runoff which causes depleted \u03b418O values of lake water (W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). Therefore, the interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies controlled the hydroclimatic variations on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. Under the strong influence of the monsoon, with direct moisture incursions accompanied by terrestrial water recycling, the hydroclimatic conditions on the southern, central, and western Tibetan Plateau demonstrate a \u2018monsoon\u2019 model during the Holocene; while a \u2018westerly\u2019 model is observed on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau in response to the variations of the Holocene westerlies.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBased on a survey of modern monitoring data of precipitation \u03b418O on the Tibetan Plateau, we found that precipitation \u03b418O is an integrated tracer of regional atmospheric processes. We also investigated a total of 20 lacustrine authigenic carbonate \u03b418O records from the Tibetan Plateau, covering the entire Holocene, to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of the regional hydroclimate. A comprehensive assessment of the potential effects on lake water isotopic composition indicates that the long-term variation of \u03b418O records on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene was mainly controlled by the moisture sources, while meltwater supply and temperature-induced evaporation may impact lake water \u03b418O values on centennial and millennial timescales. Three types of records were defined after normalizing the \u03b418O records. Type 1 records from the western and central Tibetan Plateau shows depleted values during the early Holocene and consistently increasing values during the middle to late Holocene, which is very similar to the trend of two speleothem \u03b418O records and monsoonal precipitation reconstructions from the central and southern Tibetan Plateau. The latter two represent monsoon variations on the plateau, illustrating a Northern Hemisphere insolation-driven decreasing trend during the Holocene. However, the \u03b418O records of types 2 and 3, from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (north of the Bayan Har Mountains), show a completely different pattern of variation during the Holocene. The \u03b418O values did not increase during the second half of the Holocene, but instead show a steady or a decreasing trend, suggesting an increasing trend of regional moisture in the lake basins. Such a dipolar pattern of the lake water \u03b418O records and the moisture conditions between the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and other parts of the plateau during the middle to late Holocene was caused by increasing non-monsoonal precipitation in the region derived from the westerlies. We therefore propose that the interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies controlled the hydroclimatic variations on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene.\n\n","1":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSubmarine canyons constitute important conduits for the transfer of water masses, sediment, nutrients, organic matter and pollutants between shallow- and deep-marine environments, across continental slopes (Harris and Whiteway, 2011; Fildani, 2017). They control the sorting and segregation of sediments that are ultimately deposited in deep-marine environments, via their morphology (e.g. Soutter et al., 2021; Wan et al., 2021) and distance from fluvial outlets and littoral cells (e.g. Sweet and Blum, 2016; Sweet et al., 2020). Their ability to intercept and influence oceanic currents along shelves (e.g. Jordi et al., 2008) and slopes (e.g. March\u00e8s et al., 2007; Voigt et al., 2013), can set hydrodynamic conditions in vicinity of their location (e.g. Allen et al., 2001; Connolly and Hickey, 2014; Sald\u00edas and Allen, 2020). Submarine canyons can impact the formation and evolution of slope systems by reducing local gradients (Orange et al., 1994), capturing and redirecting sediment pathways from adjacent canyons (e.g. Bernhardt et al., 2015), and functioning as tributaries to other canyons (e.g. Mountjoy et al., 2009). Buried canyons that are partially infilled can influence the pathways of younger ones by forming negative seafloor topography that can confine sediment transport (e.g. Pratson et al., 1994). Thus, they represent a crucial link for sediment routing from terrestrial hinterlands, across and along shelves and slopes, to intra-slope and basin-floor sinks.\nThe presence of submarine canyons can also influence the formation of gas hydrates (Crutchley et al., 2017) and the associated processes of trapping and release of hydrocarbons (e.g. Davies et al., 2012; Benjamin et al., 2015). Canyons can promote salt migration within the subsurface and impact the geometry of salt bodies (Fiduk, 1995), can increase the salinity of shelf waters via upwelling of deeper slope waters (e.g. Connolly and Hickey, 2014), and can tap into groundwater aquifers (e.g. Paldor et al., 2020). The association of submarine canyons with hydrocarbon-bearing deposits can promote vertical hydrocarbon migration and expulsion, which in turn can generate trains of pockmarks in younger canyons (e.g. Benjamin et al., 2015). Pockmarks can also form atop of canyon fills as a result of sediment compaction (e.g. Jobe et al., 2011); given that these structures can reach diameters of several hundred metres and depths of tens of metres (e.g. Jobe et al., 2011; Benjamin et al., 2015), their presence might affect canyon internal flows and flow pathways on the seafloor.\nSubmarine canyons are also important for faunal communities, for which they provide significant habitats. Aspects of their physiography have been suggested to exert control on the biodiversity and abundance of faunal assemblages; these aspects include canyon spacing, gradient, dendricity and sinuosity (Fanelli et al., 2018), canyon size and magnitude of incision of the shelf (Santora et al., 2018). The effect of submarine-canyon geomorphology on hydrodynamic processes also impacts the spatial distribution of faunal communities like zooplankton (Allen et al., 2001).\nSubmarine canyons are linked to potential geohazards, due to the ability of intra-canyon slope failures to trigger tsunamis (e.g. Orange et al., 1994; Power et al., 2016), and to the influence of canyon geomorphology on tsunami propagation (e.g. Aranguiz and Shibayama, 2013; Iglesias et al., 2014). Moreover, canyon-crossing seafloor telecommunication cables are at risk of breakage from canyon-margin failure and canyon-traversing sediment gravity flows (e.g. Heezen and Ewing, 1952; Hsu et al., 2008; Carter et al., 2014). Such flows are also considered responsible for the displacement of marine pipelines (e.g. Porcile et al., 2020), hence posing a hydrocarbon leakage hazard, for example. Moreover, it has been suggested that the upslope transport of warm water currents through submarine canyons along Antarctica contributes to the acceleration of ice sheet loss, which in turn influences global sea-level rise (e.g. Morrison et al., 2020; Gales et al., 2021, and references therein).\nThe sedimentary fills of submarine canyons, and their linkage to down-system submarine fans (e.g. Covault et al., 2011b; Jobe et al., 2011) and contourite-drift systems (e.g. Wang et al., 2018; Warratz et al., 2019; Serra et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022, and references therein), make them important references and targets for hydrocarbon exploration. Canyons can represent significant sinks for both macro- (e.g. Pierdomenico et al., 2019; Zhong and Peng, 2021) and micropollutants (e.g. Azaroff et al., 2020).\nHence, the study of submarine canyons represents a key area of interest for research linked to a broad range of scientific disciplines (Matos et al., 2018).\nSource-to-sink (S2S) research investigates sediment budget dynamics and process-response relationships in both ancient and modern sedimentary systems. Scaling relationships between sedimentary systems and attributes of segments of the S2S profile are commonly established. However, the focus of such studies has been chiefly on fluvial systems and submarine fans, whereas the submarine canyons that link them remain relatively understudied (e.g. S\u00f8mme et al., 2009; Nyberg et al., 2018).\nQuantitative studies provide a means for the systematic investigation of scaling relationships across and within sedimentary environments, with consideration of environmental controls such as climate, hydrodynamic processes, or tectonic setting, which dictate sediment source areas, transport pathways and sinks (e.g. Wang et al., 2019, 2020; Budai et al., 2021; Cosgrove et al., 2021). Such studies enable an assessment of the relative importance of autogenic versus allogenic controls on aspects of the geomorphology, architecture and facies characteristics of subenvironments, and of scaling-relationships they may exhibit. Such insights can be applied to infer the geometrical characteristics of formative subenvironments based on preserved architectures seen in outcrop and subsurface studies (e.g. Martinsen et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2017), and to inform laboratory and modelling studies (Nyberg et al., 2018). The applied usefulness of scaling relationships for the reconstruction and modelling of sedimentary systems at different scales of observations has been highlighted by various authors (e.g. S\u00f8mme et al., 2009; Martinsen et al., 2010; Helland-Hansen et al., 2016; Bhattacharya et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017; Nyberg et al., 2018).\nScaling relationships between aspects of canyon geomorphology and controlling factors have been identified in quantitative studies of submarine canyons at regional, continental, and global scales (see section 2.2). However, relationships between canyon morphometric parameters have only been partially investigated using global datasets, and the general applicability of such relationships across environmental settings is largely unconstrained. This study addresses these knowledge gaps.\nThe aim of this study is to improve our understanding of controlling factors on submarine-canyon geomorphology, and of the extent to which scaling relationships of canyon morphometric parameters \u2013 both mutually and with attributes of their physiographic and environmental setting \u2013 can be recognised in modern canyons. To achieve this, a global database has been built utilising datasets from published case studies of submarine canyons combined with data obtained from open-source bathymetry to support the following research objectives:\n\n(i)\nto characterize morphometric parameters of submarine canyons, both generally and with consideration of the role of environmental factors (canyon-apex location relative to the shelf-break, continental-margin type, source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment and climate zones);\n\n\n(ii)\nto identify and assess scaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters;\n\n\n(iii)\nto evaluate relationships between canyon morphometric parameters and other variables, including canyon bathymetry, distance between the canyon apex and the shoreline, attributes of the catchment, shelf and slope, and latitude of the canyon;\n\n\n(iv)\nto identify and discuss possible causal links between observed scaling relationships and autogenic and allogenic controls, the configuration of the associated source-to-sink system, and the environmental setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nBackground\n\n2.1\nControls on submarine canyon evolution\nSubmarine canyons are highly complex sedimentary systems whose evolution is influenced by a wide range of processes and environmental factors (e.g. Shepard, 1936, 1981; Pratson and Coakley, 1996; Pratson et al., 2007), as demonstrated in the recent comprehensive literature reviews by Puig et al. (2014) and Amblas et al. (2017). Despite being well studied, the genesis and long-term evolution of submarine canyons remain topics of ongoing debate, and require further understanding (e.g. Pratson et al., 2007, and references therein; Baztan et al., 2005; Puig et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2017, 2018). The relative importance of controls on canyon geomorphology is still not well understood (Li et al., 2022).\nVarious physiographic and environmental factors are known to influence canyon evolution by exerting controls on connectivity to sediment sources, on mechanisms of sediment distribution, and on types of canyon evolutionary processes. Physiographic factors that have been invoked include the distance of the canyon to fluvial outlets and littoral cells (e.g. Sweet and Blum, 2016; Sweet et al., 2020), shelf width and gradient in the vicinity of the canyon (e.g. Covault and Graham, 2010; Gamberi et al., 2015; Jipa and Panin, 2020; Bernhardt and Schwanghart, 2021), and continental-slope gradients (e.g. McGregor, 1983; Orange et al., 1994; Lo Iacono et al., 2014). Environmental factors comprise local- and regional-scale tectonics (e.g. Ratzov et al., 2012; Micallef et al., 2014; de Almeida et al., 2015; Soutter et al., 2021), sea-level fluctuations (e.g. Rasmussen, 1994; Mitchell et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2018), and climate (e.g. Henrich et al., 2010), including glaciations (e.g. Harris et al., 2014; Gales et al., 2021).\nThe oceanographic regime is also thought to influence gully formation and failures along canyon walls (e.g. Wang et al., 2022), and is a possible cause for particular geomorphic characteristics of Arctic and Antarctic gullies (Gales et al., 2013). Also, a global study of late Quaternary incised-valley fills by Wang et al. (2020) demonstrated that the facies architecture of valley fills varies across open oceans and semi-enclosed and enclosed seas, which exhibit contrasting hydrodynamics. Considering the role of marine hydrodynamic processes in the delivery of sediment to canyons, and in intra-canyon sediment transport and erosion (see section 4.2.2), and given the genetic linkage between cross-shelf lowstand fluvial systems and submarine canyons (e.g. Harris and Whiteway, 2011; Maier et al., 2018), more research is needed to establish whether and how canyon geomorphology varies as a function of the oceanographic setting.\nAnthropogenic influences can also affect the evolution of modern submarine canyons, in several ways. Sediment gravity flows can be triggered by trawling (e.g. Palanques et al., 2006; Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2013), whereas farming and deforestation (e.g. Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011), and the artificial diversion (e.g. Higgins et al., 2018) or damming of rivers (e.g. Sheng et al., 2019) may impact catchment processes and fluvial discharge rates, which in turn can impact sediment delivery to submarine canyons (e.g. Mazi\u00e8res et al., 2014; Puig et al., 2017).\n\n\n2.2\nSubmarine canyon studies\nSubmarine canyons have been the subject of many prior studies: Matos et al. (2018) conducted a review of the scientific literature on submarine canyons published between 1929 and 2016, considering 1,968 publications. These authors identified a geographical bias in prior canyon research: less than 10% of the canyons mapped globally by Harris et al. (2014) are covered by the literature, and almost half of the 1,968 publications concentrate exclusively on 11 intensively studied submarine canyons. Consequently, research efforts have largely been directed towards the particular environmental conditions and set of controls associated with a limited subset of canyons, depending on the thematic focus of the case study (see Matos et al., 2018). However, the rate at which studies on submarine canyons are published has further accelerated in recent years (Matos et al., 2018), due in part to technological advances in data acquisition and processing (e.g. Xu, 2011; Ur\u00edas Espinosa et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2020; Bailey et al., 2021). Here we summarise examples of regional, continental, and global-scale quantitative studies of submarine-canyon geomorphology that consider the canyon physiographic and environmental setting, focussing on aspects of these studies that are relevant to the research presented in this paper.\nCanyon classification schemes based on case studies from specific regions have been proposed to be universally applicable, for example where specific sets of controls are associated with a canyon (canyon-head location relative to the shelf break, type of intracanyon sedimentary processes, sediment sources and sediment characteristics; cf. Jobe et al., 2011), and models for canyon evolution have been considered relevant to canyons that developed under similar external controls, as for canyons associated with active margins (e.g. Micallef et al., 2014). However, a study of 713 submarine canyons located offshore Australia by Huang et al. (2014) revealed great variability and complexity in aspects of canyon geomorphology at the continental scale, which challenges the applicability of insights generated by regional studies at a larger scale. The authors established a hierarchical classification of shelf-incising and slope-confined canyons based on the following canyon metrics: percentage of canyon area characterised by slope gradients exceeding 15\u00b0, average canyon thalweg gradient, volume subtended by the canyon channelform, canyon-head incision depth, and distance to the nearest neighbouring canyon. Their findings demonstrate a higher number of canyon classes for slope-confined canyons compared to shelf-incising ones (see Figures 6 & 7 of Huang et al., 2014).\nRelationships between canyon geomorphology and the position of the canyon head relative to the shelf-break were also recognised in other regional-scale studies. In a study of 80 canyons offshore California (Santora et al., 2018), differences in frequency distributions of canyon dimensions were documented across shelf-incising versus slope-confined canyons, whereby shelf-incising canyons tend to have greater areas, lengths, widths and mean depths. Additionally, the authors found that canyon area scaled positively with canyon length and width, independently of the canyon-head location relative to the shelf-margin. Li et al. (2022) documented pronounced differences in 48 shelf-incised submarine canyons from the northwest South China Sea.\nFurthermore, relationships between characteristics of S2S systems and canyon geomorphology are demonstrated in a number of regional-scale studies. For example, Jipa and Panin (2020) noted that the few submarine canyons in the N and NW region of the Black Sea were associated with continental shelves up to 200 km wide, large fluvial systems of several thousand kilometres length and low-relief catchments of up to several hundred metres elevation. Such canyons were characterised by a single main stem and had large submarine fans as distal segments. By contrast, submarine canyons along the E and NE Black Sea margins, characterised by (i) high-elevation catchments, (ii) short feeder rivers (up to several hundred kilometres length), and (ii) shelves that are rarely wider than 15 km, tend to form dendritic drainage networks and are more closely spaced; also, their submarine fans tend to form a continuous apron-like zone. Their findings were in part corroborated by those of Fernane et al. (2022), who demonstrated that submarine canyons along the western Algerian margin display a greater degree of dendricity and incision into the shelf where they are associated with a narrow shelf configuration compared to canyons associated with wide shelf margins.\nFor the interpretation of autogenic and allogenic controls on canyon geomorphology, an improved understanding of the sensitivity of canyon morphometric parameters to seafloor processes and environmental factors is required. In contrast to regional studies, global-scale studies have the potential to constrain the variability in potential controls more fully in a broad range of environmental settings. Previous global-scale studies that have investigated aspects of submarine canyon geomorphology (e.g. Nelson et al., 1970; De Pippo et al., 1999; S\u00f8mme et al., 2009; Covault et al., 2011a; Harris and Whiteway, 2011; Harris et al., 2014; Soutter et al., 2021) and assessed the relative importance of factors promoting sediment-connection of canyons to shorelines (Bernhardt and Schwanghart, 2021) constitute important contributions to a fuller understanding of submarine canyon evolution. Nevertheless, such global investigations of the geomorphology of modern submarine canyons have been limited to individual canyon morphometric parameters and to consideration of specific environmental controls, with the datasets being limited in terms of their geographic coverage prior to the advent of a global inventory of modern submarine canyons \u2013 comprising 5,849 canyons \u2013 compiled by Harris and Whiteway (2011).\nIn their global study, De Pippo et al. (1999) compiled a database of selected aspects of the geomorphology of 50 submarine canyons, including canyon length, average gradient, and cross-sectional profile, together with variables describing their environmental setting (see Figure 1 of De Pippo et al., 1999). For example, the authors applied their database to tease out possible relationships between canyon geomorphology and potential controls posed by the morphological and tectonic characteristics of the associated continental margin; they additionally assessed relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, e.g. for canyon length and average canyon thalweg gradient (see Figure 5 of De Pippo et al., 1999).\nLeveraging advancements in bathymetric mapping of seafloors, the study by Harris and Whiteway (2011) provided a summary of aspects of canyon geomorphology and their physiographic setting for 5,849 submarine canyons classified on geographic region, continental-margin type, location of the canyon-head relative to the shelf-break and connection to a fluvial system. The following variables were considered: canyon length, average thalweg gradient, average sinuosity, bathymetric range, spacing, and dendricity; descriptive statistics were presented for canyons classified on margin type, canyon-head location relative to the shelf break, connection to a fluvial system, and geographic region (Table 1 of Harris and Whiteway, 2011). Statistical analyses revealed that active-margin canyons are on average steeper and shorter than their counterparts along passive margins, whereas overall canyon sinuosity tends to be similar (Figure 8 of Harris and Whiteway, 2011). In addition, the authors documented relationships between mean values of canyon parameters obtained for groups of canyons classified by geographic regions and distinguished into active- and passive-margin settings. Canyons associated with an insular-margin setting were excluded from the correlation analyses. Moreover, the authors demonstrated the lack of a relationship between latitude and average canyon sinuosity for shelf-incising canyons (Figure 9 of Harris and Whiteway, 2011). The importance of fluvial sediment connection on canyon length was inferred from the observation that canyons associated with fluvial systems and incising the shelf tend to be longer than shelf-incising canyons without a river connection and slope-confined canyons, by factors 1.60 and 2.07, respectively. In non-polar regions, Harris and Whiteway (2011) showed a positive linear relationship between the percentage of shelf-incising canyons in a geographic region and sediment discharge from rivers (Figure 10 of Harris and Whiteway, 2011).\nIn the first published digital geomorphic seafloor map by Harris et al. (2014), the authors identified 9,477 submarine canyons. The significant number of newly recognised canyons reflect in part the higher resolution of seafloor data, but also the fact that canyons associated with plateaux adjoined to continental margins were also incorporated, unlike in Harris and Whiteway (2011; see Harris et al., 2014). Harris et al. (2014) calculated mean values of canyon area and length both for the global dataset and separately for major geographic regions. The results were further distinguished based on the location of the canyon head relative to the shelf break. In addition, the mean incision depth was reported for shelf-incising canyons in all regions (see their Table 9) and for slope-confined ones in general (Harris et al., 2014). On average, canyons in the latter group display greater average depth, shorter lengths and about half the area, compared to canyons that incise the shelf. Harris et al. (2014) also showed that submarine canyons in polar regions are, on average, about twice as large in area relative to the global average; in addition to characteristics of the slope and basin-floor environments in these settings, Harris et al. (2014) linked these attributes to a control by sediment supply to deep-marine environments during glacial intervals of the Cenozoic. Arctic and Antarctic canyons tend to be the longest of all differentiated geographic regions, but only by a modest margin; compared to submarine canyons in the South Atlantic, for example, their average lengths are only 1.20 and 1.21 times larger. Shelf-incising canyons of the Arctic and Antarctica also tend to have the largest values of mean incision depth across all investigated regions, but on average they are only 1.035 and 1.006 times deeper than canyons in the North Atlantic. These findings, together with the low variability in mean values of average canyon sinuosity for polar and non-polar regions documented by Harris and Whiteway (2011), suggest that factors related to latitudinal setting variably control aspects of submarine-canyon geomorphology, and that the strength in scaling might show pronounced regional variabilities.\nTwo global studies that have focused on the longitudinal profiles of submarine canyons are the studies by Covault et al. (2011a) and Soutter et al. (2021), who investigated the longitudinal profiles of a combination of 20 canyon and channels and of 377 submarine canyons, respectively. Covault et al. (2011a) established links between the longitudinal-profile shape \u2013 classified as convex, slightly concave or very concave \u2013 and both the margin type and the depositional architecture of deep-water environments (see their Fig. 9). Soutter et al. (2021) instead investigated and discussed relationships between the Normalised Concavity Index of canyon profiles and controlling factors including attributes of the terrestrial catchment, climate and tectonic setting, as well as canyon-head location relative to the shelf break. The authors inferred a dominant tectonic control on canyon concavity, that the connection to a river is a secondary control, and that the climate of the hinterland is a relatively subordinate factor.\nCollectively, these examples document the variability in canyon morphometrics but in a way that suggests that there is no individual factor or single set of overriding controls emerging from their analyses.\nThe quantitative global assessment of canyon geomorphology undertaken in this study with consideration of aspects of the S2S system and of the environmental and physiographic setting aims to augment the findings of these earlier studies, and the current empirical knowledge of canyon geomorphology and of its links to potential controls.\n\n\n\n3\nDataset and methodology\nA database was collated that stores data describing the geomorphology of submarine canyons, their environmental context and geological controlling factors. Data have been sourced from 282 globally distributed modern submarine canyons and have been grouped into 96 separate case studies, with each case study corresponding to the study of one or several submarine canyons by a particular group of researchers (Fig. 1\n. and Table 1\n). The database comprises literature-derived, high-resolution bathymetric surveys of the seabed and high-resolution seismic datasets of the shallow subsurface, derived from 135 publications (Table 1) and open-source worldwide bathymetry data sets (https:\/\/www.ncei.noaa.gov\/maps\/bathymetry\/, n.d, GEBCO 2019 NOAA NCEI Visualization; Google Earth).\n\n3.1\nSubmarine canyon definition\nIn this study, a submarine canyon is defined as a single dominantly erosional channel form incised into a continental slope. The chosen definition of submarine canyon does not consider criteria relating to bathymetric setting, minimum canyon dimensions (cf. Harris and Whiteway, 2011), genetic origin, or canyon cross-sectional shape, and is therefore inclusive of what other authors commonly refer to as 'gullies' (e.g. Field et al., 1999; Gales et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2017), \u2018gulleys\u2019 (e.g. Gulliksen, 1978) or \u2018potential submarine canyons\u2019 (e.g. de Almeida et al., 2015). A general definition was adopted for the following reasons: (i) submarine gullies have been considered to constitute forms at the early stage of canyon formation (e.g. Amblas et al., 2017); (ii) canyon geomorphologic attributes such as canyon size can be inherently limited by their physiographic setting; and (iii) both terms are variably used for smaller-scale erosional channel-forms on the slope.\nThe canyon apex is defined as the point of the shallowest bathymetry and canyon mouth as the most distal point, along a canyon axis. The term \u201ccanyon apex\u201d has been used herein in preference to \u201ccanyon head\u201d, the latter being a common but loosely defined term in the literature referring to the proximal part of a submarine canyon. Therefore \u201ccanyon apex\u201d is used sensu stricto and \u201ccanyon head\u201d sensu lato. In networks of connected channel forms, each channel-form is treated as an individual submarine canyon, whereas the network itself is termed a \u2018canyon system\u2019 (e.g. Mitchell et al., 2007; Mountjoy et al., 2009).\n\n\n3.2\nStudy variables\nData on submarine canyons, environmental setting and external controlling factors have been coded in the form of attributes recorded in the Deep-Marine Architecture Knowledge Store (DMAKS; Cullis et al., 2019). DMAKS is a relational database that allows the systematic and standardised collation of data on deep-water sedimentary systems, as originally obtained using different methods (e.g. outcrop, core, seismic, bathymetric, sonar imaging). DMAKS stores data on the architectural, geomorphological and facies characteristics of deep-water depositional systems, as well as on their external controls and depositional context (Cullis et al., 2019). Several additional bespoke attributes have been added to DMAKS to enable the present study.\nThe dataset for this study has been obtained from multiple sources, including the peer-reviewed literature and government agency sources. Values were extracted from the texts or manually measured or calculated by us. Inherent to this approach are various sources of error, including the heterogeneity of the dataset and undetected errors in the primary datasets; these limitations are discussed in section 3.3.\nThe full set of variables employed in the analyses undertaken in this study is summarised in Table 2\n.\n\n3.2.1\nCanyon morphometric parameters\nCanyon geomorphology has been characterised by the following six morphometric parameters: (i) canyon length, (ii) canyon width (maximum and streamwise average), (iii) canyon bankfull depth (maximum and streamwise average), (iv) overall canyon sinuosity, (v) average canyon thalweg gradient, and (vi) maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 2a). Definitions of these variables are reported in Table 2. Values reported by authors have only been included for studies based on surveys that include bathymetric coverage of the entire canyon area. Average width and depth values were obtained from the literature for canyons surveyed by high-resolution bathymetry and where bathymetric data were derived from 3D seismic surveys.\n\n\n3.2.2\nEnvironmental attributes and external controls\nFor the investigation of relationships between submarine canyon geomorphology and the environmental context of the submarine canyons, attributes have been defined to record (i) canyon physiographic setting, (ii) the configuration of the canyon terrestrial catchment, continental shelf and slope, and (iii) external controls operating at the location of the canyon (Table 2 & Fig. 2).\n\n3.2.2.1\nPhysiographic setting\nThe bathymetry of the canyon is characterised by the seafloor depth at its apex and mouth (Tab. 2). For canyons with several tributaries at their head, the shallowest seafloor depth has been recorded. The canyons are also classified in relation to the position of their apices relative to the shelf-break as either (i) shelf-incising, where the canyon extends into the continental shelf, or (ii) slope-confined, where the apex of the canyon is situated below the shelf break (cf. Jobe et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2014).\n\n\n3.2.2.2\nSource-to-sink-system attributes\nRelationships between the geomorphology of submarine canyons and attributes of their terrestrial catchment have been investigated for canyons with sediment connectivity to a fluvial system at present or in the past. For these canyons, descriptors of fluvial system length, mean annual fluvial discharge, catchment area and maximum catchment area elevation (Tab. 2), have been recorded. Sediment connectivity of a submarine canyon with a fluvial source is defined based on the following three criteria:\n\n(i)\n\nThe submarine canyon displays a present connection with a fluvial system. This includes canyons fronting a river mouth, canyons for which across-shelf sediment transport from a fluvial outlet has been inferred by authors, e.g. from sedimentary structures on the seafloor as sediment waves (e.g. Puig et al., 2017), and canyons connected to up-dip subenvironments, such as shelf channels and tributary canyons, which are physically connected with a fluvial system.\n\n\n(ii)\n\nThe submarine canyon was connected to a river in the past. This includes canyons that might not currently be connected to a fluvial system, e.g. due to present-day sea-level highstand conditions or to river-mouth shift of natural or anthropogenic cause, but that are known to have been connected in the past to a river (e.g. Sweet et al., 2020).\n\n\n(iii)\n\nThe canyon apex is located within 5 km of a fluvial outlet. This criterion has been considered in view of the typical length-scale over which sand tends to be distributed to submarine canyons by rivers that lack a bathymetric connection to the canyons (see Sweet and Blum, 2016).\n\n\n\nFor canyons linked with several rivers, their cumulative length, mean annual fluvial discharge and catchment area have been recorded, to enable comparison with canyons fed by single fluvial systems. For investigation of relationships between canyon geomorphology and maximum elevation of the terrestrial catchment, the elevation above mean sea level of the highest point in the combined catchment has been recorded.\nThe continental shelf and slope hosting the canyons have been described in terms of width, average gradient and depth.\n\n\n3.2.2.3\nContinental-margin type\nThe source-to-sink system has been classified as being associated with either a passive or a tectonically active continental margin, the latter comprising canyons along both convergent and transform plate boundaries, following the continental-margin classification of Harris et al. (2014; see their Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2.2.4\nSource-to-sink setting\nThe source-to-sink setting associated with the studied canyons has been classified on whether the terrestrial catchment, shelf and slope are associated with continental landmasses (continental setting) or an island (insular setting). Canyons which could not be unambiguously assigned to a setting have not been included.\n\n\n3.2.2.5\nOceanographic environment\nTo investigate the possible controls exerted by hydrodynamic processes that vary with scale and marine water-mass confinement, and potential relationships between canyon morphometric parameters and the scale and degree of confinement of the seas where they occur, canyons are classified with respect to their oceanographic environment. To this end, two groups have been distinguished: (i) open seas, which comprise the World\u2019s oceans and experience hydrodynamic interactions with adjacent seas; they may be characterised by the occurrence of oceanic gyres; (ii) semi-enclosed and enclosed seas, which are largely bounded by landmasses and are therefore characterised by a limited hydrodynamic interaction with the oceans or seas with which they are connected; this second class includes seas, gulfs and straits.\n\n\n3.2.2.6\nLatitude\nThe latitudinal positions of canyon heads are recorded as absolute values for both hemispheres. For the investigation of latitude-related climatic influences on processes affecting canyon geomorphology, latitude values have been assigned to categories that relate to major climate belts, i.e., into tropical (corresponding to latitudes between 0\u00b0 and 23.5\u00b0), temperate (between 23.5\u00b0 and 66.5\u00b0), and polar zones (corresponding to latitudes higher than 66.5\u00b0). This simplified approach has been implemented for the following reasons: (i) existing climate classification schemes are commonly based on parameters of the terrestrial catchment and would therefore have limited applicability to canyons that do not receive significant fluvial discharge or none at all; moreover, climatic conditions in the marine environment are commonly not considered in these schemes; (ii) climate histories, including temperature and precipitation, would have to be reconstructed for both the present and the past to permit a consistent analysis of their impact on canyon evolution; this becomes particularly challenging for submarine canyons associated with large source-to-sink systems; (iii) the age of inception of the majority of the canyons in the present study is poorly constrained, so that climate histories cannot be matched closely to canyon age.\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nStatistical analysis\nRelationships between canyon morphometric parameters and descriptors of physiographic setting and external controlling factors have been investigated by statistical analyses.\n\n(i)\nDescriptive statistics of frequency distributions of canyon morphometric parameters are evaluated for classes of: canyon-apex location relative to the shelf-break, continental-margin type, source-to-sink setting, oceanographic environment, and latitudinal position of the canyon apex or head. Comparisons between distributions of values in canyon groups are undertaken.\n\n\n(ii)\nStatistical testing has been used to evaluate whether differences in mean values of canyon morphometrics between groups of canyons are statistically significant. For assessment across two groups, two-sample t-tests have been conducted, whereas differences in mean values between more than two canyon groups have been assessed by means of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). To test datasets with heteroscedastic distributions, Welch\u2019s t-test and Welch\u2019s ANOVA have been used throughout. Test statistics, degrees of freedom (DF) and P-values are presented for all tests. Results with p-values \u22640.01 are reported as statistically significant. Prior to the analyses, a logarithmic variable transformation is applied to skewed frequency distributions.\n\n\n(iii)\nCorrelation analysis has been applied to investigate pairwise relationships between the studied parameters from the individual values obtained for each studied canyon. The strength and sign of correlation between two parameters is quantified by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (r), to reveal linear relationships, and by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (rs), to reveal monotonic relationships. A correlation is considered statistically significant for p-values \u22640.01.\n\n\n\nAlthough statistical analyses have been performed for any number of readings (N), the results are commonly presented and discussed when N\u226515; it is explicitly stated when N<15.\nAll statistical analyses have been undertaken in Minitab 19.\n\n\n3.4\nLimitations of the study\nSome of the key limitations of this study can be summarised as follows.\n\n(i)\nIn studies of submarine canyons there exists some geographic and thematic bias, as recognised by Matos et al. (2018), and some of that bias may have been inherited by this work. For example, logistic, financial and environmental challenges to investigating submarine canyons in polar regions might explain the relative scarcity of local- and regional-scale case studies of submarine canyons in the Arctic and Antarctica. Also, research efforts might be more focused on specific classes of canyons: for example, larger submarine canyons might be of particular interest for studies of marine habitats or as modern analogues for ancient systems in hydrocarbon exploration. Despite this, an effort has been made to compile a globally representative dataset of case studies of submarine canyons associated with different types of environmental settings (see Fig. 1 & Table 1). The study also incorporates 12 canyon studies published after 2016, which were not considered by Matos et al. (2018) in their analysis.\n\n\n(ii)\nThe scale of slope channel forms recognised in the case studies depends on data resolution, which sets the limit of the smallest mappable geomorphic features, and affects the precision of measurements. Due to heterogeneity in data types, some variability in resolution is expected.\n\n\n(iii)\nAs in any metastudy, erroneous data reported in the primary data sources may have been inadvertently included in the database. However, all reasonable measures have been taken to ensure data accuracy.\n\n\n(iv)\nAlthough this study considers many environmental factors that may act as controls on canyon geomorphology, some relationships might arise from covariance of such factors with one or several parameters that have not been included in our analyses.\n\n\n(v)\nShelf-margin and base-of-slope depths of continental margins lacking distinct morphological breaks at the shelf-slope transition and\/or in the base-of-slope region are difficult to determine precisely. As such, these attributes may have not been reported in the literature, and have not been included in the current dataset.\n\n\n(vi)\nDespite the ability afforded by studies of modern canyons to constrain physiographic setting, external factors and process-response relationships, measurements of the physical characteristics of canyons and their settings only represent snapshots of the temporal evolution of the studied forms.\n\n\n(vii)\nThe continental-margin type, source-to-sink setting, and oceanographic environment constitute factors that apply to the entire extent of the studied canyons, and thus allow consistent grouping. In contrast, along their length, some submarine canyons might stretch across two latitudinal zones. The position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break can be variable over time, but incision of the shelf by the canyon does not per se represent a more mature evolutionary stage of the canyon. Some canyons that are presently slope-confined might have had a physical connection to the shelf in the past: their canyon heads and proximal parts may have been backfilled (Pratson et al., 2007) or may have prograded basinwards (Mauffrey et al., 2015). This must be considered in analyses of frequency distributions of canyon morphometrics across slope-confined and shelf-incising forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nScaling relationships between canyon morphometrics\n\n4.1\nObservations\nCorrelation strengths between canyon morphometric parameters are highly variable, with only some correlations being strong and statistically significant (Figs. 3 & 4\n\n a-o).\nMaximum dimensions of the studied canyons are moderately correlated with each other (Fig. 4a-c). Strong relationships that are statistically significant exist for average canyon width with maximum width (Fig. 3), length (Fig. 4a) and maximum depth (Fig. 4c), and for the latter with average depth (Fig. 3). In addition, modest significant scaling is demonstrated for maximum width and average depth (Fig. 4c). In contrast, correlations of average canyon depth with canyon length (Fig. 4b) and average canyon width (Fig. 4c) are weak and not significant. Strong correlations between length and canyon width, and no correlation between canyon length and average depth, are also observed in the dataset by Harris et al. (2014) (Fig. 4p&q).\nAverage canyon sinuosity shows significant, respectively modest and moderate, positive correlations with canyon length (Fig. 4d) and average canyon depth (Fig. 4f), and modest correlations with maximum canyon width (Fig. 4e). The negative correlation between sinuosity and average canyon thalweg gradient is significant but rather weak (Fig. 4m), whereas no correlation is seen between sinuosity and maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 4n).\nThe average canyon thalweg gradient demonstrates moderate negative correlation with canyon length (Fig. 4g) and weak negative correlation with maximum canyon width (Fig. 4h), both of which are statistically significant. The positive moderate correlation between thalweg gradient and average canyon depth is not statistically significant (N = 12; Fig. 4i). No correlation exists between thalweg gradient and either average width (Fig. 4h) and maximum sidewall steepness (Fig. 4o).\nPositive, modest and statistically significant relationships are seen between maximum canyon sidewall steepness and both maximum canyon width (Fig. 4k) and depth (Fig. 4l), whereas the maximum canyon sidewall steepness is weakly correlated with canyon length (Fig. 4j).\n\n\n4.2\nInterpretations\nCorrelations between pairs of canyon morphometric parameters suggest that both considered canyon characteristics may be affected by the same process or controlling factors.\nIn some cases, correlations may arise \u2013 either in part or fully \u2013 due to covariance with other parameters, and this may be inherent in the definition of the parameters themselves. For example, more sinuous canyons tend to have longer streamwise canyon length for a given slope extent, whereas deeper channel forms are expected to have steeper margins.\nIn addition, some canyon morphometrics appear to be more strongly related to certain environmental controls; this is discussed in sections 5, 6 and 7.\n\n4.2.1\nSedimentary processes\nBecause the effects of sedimentary processes on canyon evolution depend primarily on the sediment volumes they mobilise, their erosive strength and their areal extent, sedimentary processes can affect canyon morphometrics in different ways, at different locations along a canyon and even during the same event (e.g. Su et al., 2020). The ability of sediment gravity flows and slope failures to trigger one another (e.g. Pratson and Coakley, 1996; Bernhardt et al., 2015) and the common transition of the latter into the former (e.g. Puig et al., 2014) makes it difficult to differentiate between the relative importance of these processes in shaping canyon geomorphology. As a consequence, it may not be possible to establish causal links between intra-canyon-scaling relationships and sediment-transport mechanisms. Nevertheless, observed scaling between some canyon morphometric parameters suggests that the influence of one or several controlling factors tends to be prevalent, giving rise to canyon geomorphologic characteristics that are recognizable on a global scale despite specific regional or local conditions.\nCanyon enlargement can be driven by active erosive processes, such as primary erosion by sediment gravity flows passing through the canyon (e.g. Li et al., 2021) or by slope failure within the canyon and on the adjacent slope (e.g. Post et al., 2022), but also by accretion of the adjacent slope or of ridges between canyons, which may be caused by along-slope currents (e.g. Rona, 1970), by background sedimentation or spillover of sediment gravity flows passing through canyons (e.g. Straub and Mohrig, 2009; Armitage et al., 2010), or due to primary carbonate production (e.g. Shepard, 1972; Tournadour et al., 2017). By contrast, intra-canyon aggradation, e.g. by backfilling (Cronin et al., 2005), sediment accumulation in canyon heads (e.g. Walsh et al., 2007) and hemipelagic sedimentation (e.g. Jobe et al., 2011) weaken the effect of erosive processes on positive scaling relationships in canyon morphometry, for example by shortening canyons and decreasing their depths.\nThe fact that these processes can variably modify individual canyon morphometric parameters is likely reflected in the observed scaling between maximum and average canyon dimensions. The rather strong scaling of canyon length with average canyon width may be linked to the ability of down-canyon flows to maintain their erosive behaviour beyond the canyon mouth. The moderate scaling of canyon length with maximum width might be related to the fact that lateral slope failures lead to local widening of the canyon over the excavated area, but may only increase canyon length where the mobilised sediment volume \u2013 which might also comprise intra-canyon sediment sources \u2013 is sufficient to extend the canyon beyond its present mouth. This may arise, for example, by breaching of intra-slope structural highs or by facilitating the progradation of the continental rise. Retrograde slope failures act as a primary cause of canyon lengthening (e.g. Orange et al., 1994; Pratson and Coakley, 1996; Pratson et al., 2007) and might cause the local widening of canyons in their proximal parts in correspondence of slump scars, where these are intercepted (e.g. Mulder et al., 2012a, 2012b). Relatively strong scaling of maximum depth with maximum and average width in the sampled canyons may in part reflect simultaneous canyon-margin aggradation and intra-canyon erosion. The positive scaling between maximum width and maximum canyon sidewall steepness can in part be explained by lateral canyon-slope failures causing a local increase in canyon width and canyon sidewall steepness, and by thalweg erosion.\n\n\n4.2.2\nHydrodynamic processes\nMarine hydrodynamic processes on the shelf and slope can variably influence canyon geomorphology: (i) by their direct effect on sedimentary processes within the canyon itself, and (ii) by exerting control on sediment supply from terrestrial, intra-shelf and slope sources to canyons, which in turn can impact intra-canyon sedimentary processes.\nHydrodynamic processes that have been inferred to facilitate sediment supply to submarine canyons include tides (e.g. Mountjoy et al., 2014), long-lived longshore drifts (e.g. Normark et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2018), slope currents (e.g. Wang et al., 2018), high-energetic waves (e.g., solitary waves, Yin et al., 2019; storm waves, Sequeiros et al., 2019), and dense shelf-water cascading (e.g. Canals et al., 2006; Puig et al., 2014, and references therein; Gales et al., 2021). The processes are highly variable in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration and area of influence, and these factors affect both the volume and grain size of sediment sourced to canyons. Intra-canyon erosion, remobilisation and transport of sediment have been linked to tidal (e.g. Liu and Yin, 2004) and unidirectional oceanic currents (e.g. Itoh et al., 2010) passing through a canyon, and to the focussing of internal waves in both the shallower parts of shelf-incising canyons (e.g. Smith et al., 2018) and at greater water depths in canyons confined within the slope (e.g. Wang et al., 2022). Hence, the influence of marine hydrodynamic processes on canyon geomorphology is complex and might both amplify or weaken the impact of sedimentary processes on the strength of scaling relationships between canyon morphometric attributes.\nFor example, canyons hosted on continental margins with strong oceanic currents might experience less frequent canyon-margin failures and reduced aggradation, due to the ability of such currents to inhibit sedimentation along canyon margins (e.g. Green, 2011). As a result, the impact of axial sediment gravity flows on scaling in canyons might be, to a lesser degree, overprinted by lateral failure in these canyons. On the contrary, currents that can lead to sediment accumulation along canyon margins may strengthen the scaling between canyon depth, width and margin slopes (see section 4.2.1). Moreover, the complex influence of slope currents and internal tidal waves on canyon geomorphology, related to the co-occurrence of intra-canyon erosional and depositional processes including canyon flushing and canyon-wall failure (see Wang et al., 2022) might variably affect the strength in scaling between canyon morphometrics.\n\n\n4.2.3\nStructural controls\nStructural controls might affect canyon geomorphology by their influence on pre-existing and developing seafloor topography, which might have contributed to the weakening of some of the relationships between canyon morphometric attributes. For example, where fault and diapiric structures form part of the canyon walls or are in vicinity of the canyon margin, they can steepen the canyon sidewalls (e.g. Yu and Chang, 2002; Bernhardt et al., 2015), and might overprint the effect of concurrent intra-canyon erosion by down-canyon sediment flows and canyon sidewall failure on canyon width, depth and sidewall steepness and the strength of their mutual scaling. In addition, emerging topography, generated for example by coral reef growth (e.g. Puga-Bernab\u00e9u et al., 2011) or diapiric uplift (e.g. Chiang et al., 2012), might cause flow deceleration, flow deflection, flow stripping and\/or grain size segregation, which in turn might weaken the erosional effect of flows further down-canyon. Similarly, substrate heterogeneity arising from pre-existing structural features or buried canyons might cause spatial variations in substrate erodibility. In turn, the erodibility of canyon floors or walls might be diminished or enhanced over the affected area, which can promote an overall irregular canyon geometry, and variably impact the average canyon sinuosity and canyon thalweg gradient.\n\n\n4.2.4\nBiogenic processes\nThe effect of the colonization of canyon walls and margins by marine fauna on canyon-wall stability has received limited attention in the literature (e.g. Shepard, 1981; Eittreim et al., 1982; Carlson and Karl, 1984, and references therein). Depending on factors such as nature of substrate, degree of bioturbation, filling and cementation, the canyon sidewall stability might be increased or decreased by bioturbation. Similarly, vegetation cover in proximal parts of canyons, specifically by marine flora in the photic zone, might reduce the erodibility of canyon slopes. The resulting variability in the erodibility of canyon walls and apices might affect the scaling relationships between canyon length, width and sidewall steepness. Thus, biogenic processes might constitute a controlling factor on scaling in canyon morphology. Future research is needed to enhance our understanding of the impact of biota on canyon geomorphology.\n\n\n\n\n5\nRelationships between canyon morphometric parameters and attributes of the physiographic setting\n\n5.1\nDistance between canyon and shoreline\n\n5.1.1\nObservations\nThe minimum distance between the canyon apex and the shoreline is not correlated to any of the canyon morphometric parameters except for the average canyon width (Figs. 5 & 6a-f\n), for which modest but statistically significant positive correlation is seen (Fig. 6b). However, in the assessment of a relationship with average canyon width, the average widths of canyons with a distance to a continent or island of \u2264 25 kilometres could not be evaluated.\n\n\n5.1.2\nInterpretations\nAlthough the distance of the canyon to the shoreline plays a role in sediment distribution from fluvial sources across shelves and slopes (section 6.1), the results show that relationships between the distance of the canyon to the shoreline and overall canyon geomorphology are weak. It can thus be inferred that the distance to the shoreline itself is not a major factor, relative to others.\n\n\n\n5.2\nCanyon bathymetry\n\n5.2.1\nObservations\n\n5.2.1.1\nSeafloor depth at the canyon apex\nMost canyon morphometrics correlate poorly with seafloor depth at the canyon apex (Figs. 5 & 7a-f). Modest negative correlations are seen with average canyon depth, and a weak negative relationship with maximum canyon depth, both of which are statistically significant (Fig. 7c). A weak but significant negative correlation is also displayed with average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 7d).\n\n\n5.2.1.2\nSeafloor depth at the canyon mouth\nThe seafloor depth at the canyon mouth tends to correlate significantly with all investigated canyon morphometric parameters except for average canyon width (Figs. 5 & 8a-f). Moderate positive correlations are seen with canyon length (Fig. 8a), maximum canyon width (Fig. 8b), both maximum and average canyon depth (Fig. 8c), and with average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 8d), whereas correlations with maximum canyon sidewall steepness are weaker (Fig. 8f). In contrast, a weak negative correlation is seen with the average canyon thalweg gradient (Fig. 8e).\n\n\n\n5.2.2\nInterpretations\n\n5.2.2.1\nSeafloor depth at the canyon apex\nNo clear relationships are seen between canyon geomorphology and the seafloor depth at the apex of the canyon, except for canyon depth. Data on maximum and average canyon dimensions demonstrate that large canyons can develop regardless of the seafloor depth at the canyon apex. The results indicate that the absolute canyon-apex depth does not necessarily relate to controlling factors influencing canyon geomorphology, such as a connection to sediment sources (section 6.1), the hydrodynamic regime (section 4.2.2) or structural controls (section 4.2.3). Although the canyon length increases with retrograde erosion at the canyon head, which leads to progressive shallowing of the canyon apex, the bathymetry of the basin ultimately determines the canyon length (section 6.3). The tendency of canyons to be deeper when their apex is shallower might reflect how canyon deepening may be facilitated by erosive sediment gravity flows linked to the progressive retrogradation of the canyon, which can enhance sediment delivery from terrestrial and intrashelf sources and from sediment remobilisation within the canyon. Weak scaling between canyon morphometric parameters and canyon-apex depth might also reflect how substrate lithology and seafloor gradients, which affect canyon morphodynamics and the magnitude and frequency of mass-wasting processes, vary systematically with depth (e.g. Harris et al., 2014; Diesing, 2020).\n\n\n5.2.2.2\nSeafloor depth at the canyon mouth\nThe results suggest that canyons reaching greater depths tend to have greater maximum dimensions and average depths, but not average widths. The observed increase in maximum canyon width and depth with increasing seafloor depth at the canyon mouth may be linked to the widening and deepening of canyons by turbidity currents in the region of the canyon mouth as a response to a decrease in slope gradient (e.g. Brunt et al., 2013). In addition, results of physical experiments suggest that, in long canyons, the upwelling of along-slope currents via the canyon mouth creates cyclonic eddies in the mouth region (Waterhouse et al., 2009). This mechanism might cause lateral erosion at the canyon margins and might promote intra-canyon erosion in the canyon-mouth area.\nOur results also indicate that canyons reaching into deeper waters tend to be more sinuous, which might reflect an increased impact of seafloor relief on canyon geomorphology with progressive extension of the canyon across the continental slope. For example, canyons might become more sinuous and longer where their pathways are deflected and redirected by topographic highs (e.g. Micallef et al., 2014) and intraslope depressions (e.g. Bourget et al., 2010). The effect of seafloor topographic variability might also in part explain the positive scaling of maximum width with seafloor depth, in view of how longer canyons are more likely to have a larger number of sections displaying local widening in planform, for example where intraslope depressions are incorporated in the canyon.\nFor maximum canyon sidewall steepness, the positive scaling with seafloor depth at the canyon mouth might in part reflect how the studied canyons located in open seas tend to have steeper canyon margins than those in semi-enclosed and enclosed seas (section 7.4), and continental slopes in open oceanic settings reaching greater depths.\n\n\n\n\n5.3\nLatitudinal position of the canyon apex\nThe canyons in our study cover a latitudinal range between 1\u00b0 and 72\u00b0 degrees. However, data on high-latitude canyons is limited to 15 examples from the NW Norwegian continental margin and the Barrow Canyon in the NE Chukchi Sea; polar canyons along the Antarctic margin are notably lacking in the dataset (see section 3.3).\n\n5.3.1\nObservations\nFor absolute values of latitude of the canyon apex and canyon morphometric parameters, correlations are weak to moderate in strength (Figs. 5 & 9a-f). Moderate positive correlation exists between latitude and average canyon width (Fig. 9b), and modest negative correlations between latitude and both average depth (Fig. 9c) and maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 9f). Weaker but statistically significant correlations are seen for canyon length (Fig. 9a), average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 9d) and the average canyon thalweg gradient (Fig. 9e), which are negative for the latter and positive for the first two variables.\n\n\n5.3.2\nInterpretations\nThe limited correlation between latitude and canyon morphometric parameters is interpreted to (i) arise from the complex ways in which climate can influence processes that can control canyon geomorphology (section 4.2); and (ii) reflect how the occurrence, frequency and magnitude of some processes vary with latitude, or are prevalent in \u2013 or even exclusive to \u2013 certain latitudinal belts.\nClimate can variably influence sediment fluxes to marine environments and submarine canyons, for example by exerting controls on precipitation and subaerial erosion (e.g. Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011; Clift, 2020). Despite marked regional variations, annual precipitation rates decrease with latitude on a global scale (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). A general relationship between precipitation and denudation rates has been discussed in the literature (e.g. Fournier, 1949; Langbein and Schumm, 1958; Wilson, 1973; Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011; Zhang et al., 2022). Local and regional erosion rates might vary greatly due to the impact of additional factors such as lithology, tectonic uplift and vegetation cover (e.g. Kober et al., 2015; Torres Acosta et al., 2015; Starke et al., 2020). Hence, the weakness in correlation between latitude and canyon morphometrics might reflect the complex interrelationships between these factors, variability in the degree to which they are controlled by latitude, or that they are not important controls on submarine-canyon geomorphology.\nSediment discharge in rivers tends to peak during extreme weather events (e.g. Mulder and Syvitski, 1995), and to vary in concert with seasonal phenomena like monsoons (e.g. Clift, 2020). For example, cyclones can set the conditions that trigger hyperpycnal flows and turbidity currents at river mouths (e.g. Milliman and Kao, 2005). The passing of such cyclone-driven flows through submarine canyons is known from low-latitudinal regions including the South China Sea (e.g. Milliman and Kao, 2005; Zhang et al., 2018) and the Philippines (e.g. Sequeiros et al., 2019; Porcile et al., 2020), but cyclones also occur at temperate latitudes (e.g. Schultz et al., 2019; Son et al., 2022), and tend to preferentially occur in certain geographic regions in both hemispheres (e.g. Goni et al., 2009; Schultz et al., 2019). Storm-induced intra-canyon flows have been reported from many examples at tropical and temperate latitudes, and can also be linked to the remobilisation of shelf deposits as well as excess pore water pressure facilitating the remobilisation of surface sediments in the vicinity of canyon heads (e.g. Puig et al., 2004, 2014, and references therein).\nThus, climate-related factors that might exert control on canyon geomorphology are in many cases not tied to a certain latitudinal belt and cannot generally be captured by monotonic relationships across tropical and temperate zones.\nThe potential influence of glacial processes on canyon geomorphology is especially relevant to canyons in polar and mid-latitude regions that were covered by ice sheets during glacial intervals. Sediment can be supplied to slope environments by various glacial processes. The relative predominance of such processes and their importance as sediment sources to submarine canyons can vary over a glacial-interglacial cycle (e.g. Kagami et al., 1991; Gales et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2022). For example, during glacial and interglacial intervals, where ice sheets have prograded across continental shelves, sediment can be distributed to canyon heads via sediment gravity flows fed by subglacial ice streams and meltwater discharge (e.g. Kagami et al., 1991; Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Gales et al., 2021). In contrast, glacioisostatic shelf downwarping and uplift within the shelf might cause disconnection of canyons from sediment sources, by diverting sediment pathways and creating intrashelf sinks (e.g. Kagami et al., 1991). Moreover, ice-sheet loading along shelf margins during glacial maxima and sea-level lowstands is considered a potential trigger to mass failures on continental slopes (e.g. Mulder and Moran, 1995; Gales et al., 2021). This mechanism might contribute to intra-canyon erosion by slope failures that would trigger, or evolve into, sediment gravity flows, and cause mass failures in canyons that have reached or retrograded into glaciated shelves. In addition, sediment can be supplied to slope systems from ice-rafted debris (e.g. Gales et al., 2021; Ha et al., 2022), a process which is influenced by climate but occurs during both glacial and interglacial periods (e.g. Hemming, 2004; Alvarez-Solas et al., 2013; Ha et al., 2022). Sediment can also be transported to canyons via down-canyon cascading of dense shelf water, as seen in the Antarctic Hillary Canyon (see Gales et al., 2021).\nIn high-latitude settings, sediment connection of canyons to terrestrial catchments might also be affected by glacial isostatic adjustment subsequent to glacial intervals leading to river diversions (e.g. Pico et al., 2018).\nAn example of steep canyon margins (>40\u00b0) is reported for submarine canyons along the Labrador margin (e.g. Dowdeswell et al., 2016). One factor that might contribute to steeper margins in canyons in higher latitudes is the glaciation of continental margins. The prevalence of line sources in glacial margin settings, as opposed to point sources in low-latitudinal settings, has been suggested (e.g. Martinsen, 2005; Armitage et al., 2010): sediment can be discharged rapidly from glaciers and ice streams, and distributed sediment dispersal across the continental slope (Martinsen, 2005) can promote the aggradation of canyon margins and inter-canyon ridges due to background sedimentation and overspill from channelised flows in canyons (e.g. Armitage et al., 2010; Gales et al., 2021), which in turn increase their proneness to slope failure (Armitage et al., 2010).\nAlthough suitable data only include submarine canyons at latitudes up to 45\u00b0, the lack of any relationships between latitude and sinuosity is in agreement with findings by Harris and Whiteway (2011) for shelf-incising canyons (see their Fig. 9). The influence of latitude-related processes on submarine-channel sinuosity has been debated: an inverse relationship between channel sinuosity and latitude, linked to influence of the Coriolis force and variations in sediment type and flow type within different latitudinal zones, has been proposed (e.g. Peakall et al., 2012), but its robustness has been subsequently challenged (e.g. Sylvester and Pirmez, 2017). The results indicate that mechanisms invoked as latitudinal controls on sinuosity for submarine channels may not be applicable to submarine canyons. This research area needs further investigation.\nRegardless, these considerations must be viewed with reservation due to the limited size of the datasets for arctic and tropical examples, and because of geographic bias. For example, canyons offshore NW Norway are accommodated on a passive margin in an open-sea setting, two environmental conditions that appear to promote steepening of canyon sidewalls; the former by promoting slope failure within canyons (section 7.2) and the latter by favouring canyon margin aggradation related to oceanic currents in open-sea settings (section 7.4).\n\n\n\n\n6\nScaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters and source-to-sink system attributes\nScaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters and attributes of related terrestrial catchments, continental shelves and slopes have been evaluated. For 69 submarine canyons, which represent 24% of the studied canyons, scaling relationships between canyon and terrestrial-catchment parameters have been investigated, except for maximum canyon sidewall steepness, average canyon width and depth, due to data paucity. The same applies for correlations of average canyon width and depth with slope characteristics.\nAn overview of the results is presented in form of heatmaps of correlation (Fig. 10a-c). Furthermore, relationships between attributes of canyon-associated S2S systems (Fig. 11\n) have been investigated. This has been undertaken to aid in the interpretation of controls on canyon morphometry by identifying where relationships might in part reflect covariance with one or several other factors. Correlations of canyon morphometrics with attributes of the catchment, shelf and slope are presented as scatterplots in sections 6.1 to 6.3 (Figs. 12\u201315\n\n\n\n), in which the findings for the individual S2S segments are discussed. In addition, canyon morphometry has been quantitatively assessed for canyons grouped based on shelf-break thresholds of 120 m and 130 m below present-day sea level at the site of the canyon (Fig. 14a-f).\n\n6.1\nTerrestrial catchment\n\n6.1.1\nObservations\nFluvial system length displays moderate and statistically significant positive correlation with maximum canyon depth (Fig. 12i), and modest but not significant positive correlation with maximum canyon width (Fig. 12e).\nSimilarly, moderate significant positive correlations between catchment size and canyon maximum depth and width are seen (Figs. 12 g&k).\nAverage annual fluvial discharge has moderate direct correlations with canyon length (Fig. 12b) and average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 12n); both relationships are statistically significant.\nModerate statistically significant positive correlations exist between maximum catchment elevation and canyon length (Fig. 12d), maximum width (Fig. 12h) and average sinuosity (Fig. 12p).\n\n\n6.1.2\nInterpretations\nThe observed relationships between canyon length, maximum canyon depth and average canyon sinuosity with attributes of the terrestrial catchment likely reflect how fluvial sediment discharge can promote intra-canyon erosion by down-canyon flows, e.g. the upslope lengthening of canyons at their apices (e.g. Piper and Normark, 2009), their deepening in the region of canyon mouths, and how the streamwise length of more sinuous canyons is inherently longer (see section 5.2.2.2).\nThe extent to which the morphology of a submarine canyon is affected by fluvial sediment discharge depends on its erosional versus depositional impact on individual canyon morphometrics, which is determined by many factors and their interplay. The bedrock lithology of terrestrial source areas has been invoked as a control on canyon formation in view of how it can influence the runout distance and erosive strength of submarine flows, e.g. by affecting sediment density, composition and transport mechanisms (Smith et al., 2017). In addition, characteristics of the seafloor substrate can impact its erodibility, which also has an effect on the magnitude of intra-canyon erosion by the flows; for example carbonate cementation can decrease erodibility and stabilise the substrate and canyon walls (e.g. Oiwane et al., 2011), thereby reducing the potential of mass failure on slopes (e.g. Chang et al., 2021) and within canyons. With increasing distance between the river mouth and the submarine canyon head, the sediment transport efficiency decreases as a function of distance and grain size. A global study on sediment delivery to submarine canyons from fluvial systems (Sweet and Blum, 2016) indicates that canyons tend to intercept gravel-sized sediment when their head is within ca. 500 m of a fluvial source, sand-sized sediment when it is within 1 to 5 km, and silt and clay-sized sediment when it is within ca. 40 km. The segregation of grain sizes in shelf-crossing submarine flows can impact canyon evolution; findings from studies of the Monterey Canyon suggest that the presence of unconsolidated sands within a canyon might be a prerequisite for intra-canyon turbidity current generation (Paull et al., 2018), whereas surficial mud deposits on the canyon floor might promote self-acceleration of these flows (Hereema et al., 2020).\nThe variability of these factors across S2S systems can explain the weakness with which canyon morphometric parameters are scaled with attributes of the terrestrial catchments. Weakness in correlation may also be due to other controls overprinting the effect of fluvial discharge on canyon geomorphology; these controls may include, for example, intra-canyon sedimentary processes (see section 4.2.1), hydrodynamic processes (section 4.2.2), structural controls (section 4.2.3) and biogenic processes (section 4.2.4), as well as sediment remobilisation within the shelf and slope.\n\n\n\n6.2\nContinental shelf\n\n6.2.1\nObservations\nThe shelf width is moderately directly correlated with the maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 13p), and only modestly with average canyon width (Fig. 13d) and maximum canyon depth (Fig. 13g). The shelf width is directly correlated with the canyon length (Fig. 13a) and inversely with the average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 13j), but these relationships are weak.\nThe shelf-break depth correlates significantly with all investigated canyon morphometric parameters except for the maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 13q), exhibiting moderate positive correlation with the canyon length (Fig. 13b) and modest correlation with the average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 13k); correlations with maximum width (Fig. 13e) and depth (Fig. 13h) are weaker. In contrast, the average canyon thalweg gradient shows weak but significant inverse scaling with the shelf-break depth (Fig. 13n). Moderate scaling exists between the shelf-break depth and the average canyon width, but the data stem from two geographic regions only: offshore NE Australia and NE Brazil, both associated with shallow (70-85 m) shelves (Fig. 13e).\nCorrelations of canyon morphometric parameters with the average shelf gradient are mostly weak and not significant (Fig. 13a-r). Moderate and significant correlation is observed between shelf gradient and average canyon width (Fig. 13f), but these results are based on data from two geographic regions only. Modest inverse correlation is seen between shelf gradient and maximum canyon sidewall steepness, which is not statistically significant (Fig. 13r).\nSubmarine canyons with a present-day shelf break deeper than 120 m bsl are on average longer and have greater maximum widths and depths, higher average canyon sinuosities and lower average canyon thalweg gradients than canyons with a shelf-break shallower than 120 m bsl. The same trends are seen for groups of canyons distinguished based on a threshold of shelf-break depth of 130 m (Fig. 14a-f). Although a greater range in maximum canyon sidewall steepness is seen in canyons associated with shelf breaks deeper than 120 m, average values between both canyon groups are very similar. Data on maximum canyon depth and maximum canyon sidewall steepness that can be employed in this analysis are limited, whereas data on average width and depth are only available for canyons installed on slopes with shelf breaks shallower than 120 m.\n\n\n6.2.2\nInterpretations\nThe width of the shelf plays a role in across-shelf sediment distribution from fluvial outlets to the shelf edge (e.g. Sweet et al., 2020). Narrower shelves are characterised by shorter distances to fluvial outlets that can deliver sediment to canyon heads, and may allow sediment connection of canyons with rivers and littoral cells to be maintained during sea-level highstands (e.g. Covault et al., 2007; Normark et al., 2009; Jipa and Panin, 2020). Steeper shelf gradients might also inhibit deposition by hyperpycnal flows and promote bedload transport of coarse sediment from rivers across shelves (e.g. Jipa and Panin, 2020).\nBy contrast, the effect of hydroisostasy on continental levering and the ensuing steepening of continental shelves is thought to be stronger for wider shelves, probably by a factor \u22640.3 since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), relative to narrower shelves (Hutton et al., 2013). Nevertheless, despite being more prone to hydroisostatic flexure, wider shelves tend to have gentler gradients than narrower shelves.\nWider shelves also tend to have resulted from greater shelf-edge progradation, which can occur in response to greater rates of sediment supply to the outer shelf and upper slope from terrestrial catchments and from shelf-internal sources (e.g. Mougenot et al., 1983; Carvajal et al., 2009; Blum et al., 2013), as well as from the up-building of slope sediment prisms from drifts (e.g. Fulthorpe and Carter, 1991). However, although a wider shelf indicates a more sustained sediment supply to a shelf margin, sediment transport across wide shelves into submarine canyons is most effective for canyons that have significantly retrograded the shelf and\/or are connected with a river, either directly or via shelf channels or shelf-edge deltas. With increasing shelf width, the effectiveness of across-shelf sediment transport from fluvial outlets decreases for coarser grained sediment, leading to variations in grain-size distribution of sediment discharged from rivers across the shelf. Hence, the importance of erosion by submarine flows linked to rivers on canyon morphology becomes likely less significant on shelves wider than 5 km, given the expected paucity of sand grain-size fractions reaching beyond this boundary (section 6.1). In addition, the frequency and magnitude of hyperpycnal flows can be affected by factors other than the shelf width, such as salinity of the water body, climate and relative sea-level change (e.g. Mulder et al., 2003; Dadson et al., 2005).\nThe effectiveness of across-shelf sediment transport is also affected by hydrodynamic processes associated with tidal currents, along-shelf currents and waves (Nittrouer and Wright, 1994; Wang et al., 2010). The ability of waves to remobilise sediment is greater at shallower depths (Peters and Loss, 2012); this sediment transport mechanism might have a greater areal effect on wide and shallow shelves with lower gradients.\nMoreover, the shelf topography can variably affect across-shelf sediment dispersal into submarine canyons: shelf uplift and deformation by tectonic activity (e.g. Johnson et al., 2017) and the presence of reefs (see section 4.2.3) can create seafloor topography and modify shelf gradients, which in turn can force sediment transport pathways through shelf valleys and submarine canyons incising the shelf. Currents, waves and flows carrying sediment might also be deflected away from canyons by intrashelf highs of variable origin.\nThe subaerial exposure of continental shelves at lowstand can lead to the amalgamation of river catchment areas as confluences are established; this might significantly enhance sediment supply to individual fluvial outlets, and in turn to canyons with sediment connectivity to these systems, especially for large fluvial systems that can arise as wide shelves are exposed (Blum et al., 2013). Additional sediment might be conveyed to canyons from the local erosion of shelf substrate when rivers traverse the exposed shelf (e.g. Sweet et al., 2020).\nSome of the scaling relationships between shelf configuration and canyon morphometrics may also be due to covariance with other related parameters. For example, scaling of canyon length with shelf-break depth might in part reflect how deeper shelves are associated with wider slopes, and how shelf-break depths tend to increase for terrestrial catchments associated with larger fluvial systems or multiple fluvial sources, greater average annual discharge and catchment size. However, scaling relationships between shelf-break depth and attributes of the terrestrial catchment are not significant.\nDuring episodes of sea-level lowstand, such as during the LGM, canyons with their heads in vicinity of the shelf-edge could be fed by fluvial systems that had prograded onto the shelves (e.g. Sweet et al., 2020).\nIn sequence stratigraphic models, routing of significant volumes of sand-sized sediment across continental slopes to basin floors and the development of submarine fans is perceived to be most effective during relative sea-level lowstands (e.g. Posamentier et al., 1991), which would suggest that canyon evolution by down-canyon sediment gravity flows might also be enhanced during these intervals. Reconstructions and estimates for the eustatic fall during the LGM have been variably placed between ca. 120 m to 135 m bsl (e.g. Clark and Mix, 2002; Simms et al., 2019, and references therein), so that most shelves with shelf breaks shallower than 120 m bsl have likely been subaerially exposed during the LGM. Despite this, the studied canyons hosted on shelves with shelf breaks deeper than 120 m bsl tend to be larger, to be more sinuous, and to have lower canyon thalweg gradients than those with shelf breaks at 120 m or less. This indicates that sediment connection of canyons to rivers and littoral cells during phases of sea-level lowstands is not as important a control on canyon geomorphology compared to other controls. The findings might also indicate how deeper shelves tend to be associated with larger terrestrial catchments (Fig. 15; Wang et al., 2019).\nThe complex role of shelf physiography and across-shelf sediment transport, together with covariance in shelf and canyon characteristics in response to common controls on sediment dispersal, explain the limited value of shelf configuration as a predictor of canyon geomorphology.\n\n\n\n6.3\nContinental slope\n\n6.3.1\nObservations\nThe slope width exhibits strong and significant correlation with canyon length (Fig. 15a), and moderate significant correlations with maximum width (Fig. 15d), maximum depth (Fig. 15g) and the average canyon thalweg gradient (Fig. 15m).\nThe slope-break depth shows moderate scaling with maximum canyon depth (Fig. 15h) and maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 15q), and rather weak but statistically significant correlation with canyon length (Fig. 15b).\nFor the average slope gradient, moderate correlations are demonstrated with maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 15r) and average canyon thalweg gradient (Fig. 15o), whereas correlations with other parameters are weak and not significant (Fig. 15a-r).\n\n\n6.3.2\nInterpretations\nThe canyon length is the only canyon morphometric parameter that is related to the continental-slope width, as reflected in the strong scaling between these two variables and, to a smaller extent, in the relationship between canyon length and slope-break depth.\nPositive relationships are seen for slope width with maximum canyon width and depth, and for the latter with slope-break depth; these relationships reflect how intra-canyon erosion is promoted at the canyon mouth (see section 5.2.2.2).\nThe positive relationship between slope-break depth and maximum canyon depth might also reflect how canyons in open seas tend to be deeper compared to canyons in semi-enclosed and enclosed seas (see section 7.4).\nThe results show that average canyon sinuosity is not correlated to the slope-break depth or to slope steepness. Additional data are needed to evaluate potential correlation between slope width and average canyon sinuosity.\nThe modest, positive correlation between the overall slope gradient and average canyon thalweg gradient relates to how the average canyon thalweg gradient is constrained by the average gradient of the continental slope; yet important variability is observed. In this study, as in previous ones (e.g. Harris and Whiteway, 2011), the overall canyon thalweg gradient is determined in part by the position of both canyon apex and mouth, which are themselves related to local seafloor relief. The observed moderate negative relationship between slope width and average canyon thalweg gradient reflects how wider slopes tend to display gentler gradients (Fig. 11; cf. S\u00f8mme et al., 2009).\nThe moderate, positive scaling seen between maximum canyon sidewall steepness and the average slope gradient may reflect how slopes that are steeper on average may be associated with increased erosion in submarine canyons, in relation to steeper slopes promoting processes of mass failure (e.g. McGregor, 1983; Susanth et al., 2021), and potentially driving retrograde slope failure (Lo Iacono et al., 2014), as well as vertical canyon incision (e.g. Susanth et al., 2021). Following this line of interpretation, the negative correlation of slope width with maximum canyon sidewall steepness might be a record of the covariance between average slope gradient and slope width. An inverse moderate relationship is seen between slope-break depth and maximum canyon sidewall steepness, but the dataset does not include slope-break depths between 4,000 and 6,000 m bsl and dominantly includes canyons associated with continental-slope breaks that are 2,000 to 4,000 m bsl. More data are needed to confirm this relationship.\nThe lack of correlation between the average slope gradient and maximum canyon dimensions indicate that the average slope gradient has no significant influence on canyon size, in spite of how it might affect the magnitude of retrograde erosion and the erosive strength of down-canyon sediment gravity flows. Also, the average slope gradient does not capture local relief along the slope profiles, which can control sediment bypass (e.g. Soutter et al., 2021); further investigation of the role of slope relief and slope profile types as controls on canyon geomorphology is required.\n\n\n\n\n7\nVariations in canyon morphometric parameters across classes of environments\nDescriptive statistics of frequency distributions of canyon morphometric parameters have been evaluated for the entire dataset (Fig. 16\n a-f), as well as for separate groups of canyons reflecting categories of canyon-apex location relative to the shelf-break, continental-margin type, source-to-sink setting, oceanographic environment, and latitudinal zones (sections 7.1 to 7.5). This was done to investigate whether and how factors associated with the environmental setting may control canyon geomorphology. Meaningful comparisons of average canyon width and depth as a function of S2S system setting and latitudinal zone, and for average canyon depth relative to canyon-head location, were not possible due to limited data availability.\nIn addition, ratios of maximum width to maximum depth across the different environmental settings have been assessed (section 7.6).\nThe distributions of each canyon morphometric parameter are graphically presented in form of boxplots (Figs. 16\u201322) and are discussed in sections 7.1 to 7.6 below.\n\n7.1\nCanyon-apex location relative to the shelf break\n\n7.1.1\nObservations\nThe studied shelf-incising canyons tend to be longer (Fig. 17a), more sinuous (Fig. 17f), and with larger average widths (Fig. 17c) than slope-confined canyons, on average by factors of 2.25, 1.09 and 1.52, respectively. Across these two groups, these are the morphometric parameters whose mean values differ significantly; differences are also seen in maximum canyon depth that are associated with p values that are just above the defined threshold of statistical significance. Although canyons incising the shelf display on average slightly greater maximum and overall widths, slope-confined canyons reach the same values (Fig. 17b&c), and the largest value of average width is associated with a slope-confined canyon (Fig. 17c). Although greater maximum depths (Fig. 17d), and lower overall thalweg gradients (Fig. 17g) are seen in canyons incising the shelf, differences in their average values are not statistically significant. The data on average canyon depth are limited, but the results show very similar ranges in values across the two groups (Fig. 17e). On average, the maximum sidewall steepness is similar between groups of canyons classified on the location of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break, but slope-confined canyons display a greater range (Fig. 17h).\nFor the canyons studied by Harris et al. (2014), statistical tests reveal significant differences in mean values of length (Fig. 17i) and average depth (Fig. 17j) across the two groups. As in the canyons considered in our study, shelf-incising canyons are on average longer than their slope-confined counterparts, by a factor of 1.47, which is lower than what found in our study (2.25). Harris and Whiteway (2011) also reported mean values of canyon length; studied shelf-incising canyons with and without a river connection were on average 2.07 and 1.29 times longer, respectively, than canyons with their apex below the shelf break.\n\n\n7.1.2\nInterpretations\nThe greater lengths of shelf-incising canyons may reflect how retrograde incision of the shelf and the promotion of canyon progradation by sediment gravity flows originating on the shelf and in the terrestrial catchment constitute primary controls on the length of submarine canyons. Sediment is supplied to the canyons via coupling with fluvial outlets or littoral cells and locally from within the shelf (sections 6.1 & 6.2). In addition, canyon heads placed above the storm wave-base can intercept sediment mobilised and transported during storm events (e.g. Sequeiros et al., 2019) (section 4.2.2). Our finding that shelf-incising canyons are on average longer than their slope-confined counterparts are in agreement with observations by Harris and Whiteway (2011) and Harris et al. (2014).\n\nHarris et al. (2014) also show that shelf-incising canyons are on average twice as large in area compared to slope-confined canyons, whereas canyons of the latter group are on average almost twice as deep. However, for the canyons considered in this study, characteristics like the maximum width, maximum depth, average canyon thalweg gradient and maximum canyon sidewall steepness are not related to whether canyons are incised into the shelf. Thus, overall, the relative position of the canyon apex to the shelf break does not tie to these specific geomorphological characteristics. The results may however also reflect how some of the currently slope-confined canyons had a past connection to the shelf, now lost due to backfilling of their proximal parts (e.g. Pratson et al., 2007) and progradation of their heads (e.g., in relation to high sediment supply; cf. Mauffrey et al., 2015).\nSlope-confined canyons can be fed by sands overpassing the shelf edge if their heads are in the range of the run-out distance of turbidity currents linked to fluvial discharge or littoral cells (e.g. Cronin et al., 2005; Yin et al., 2019). Canyons in high-latitude settings affected by glaciation can receive sediment delivered by the progradation of ice sheets onto shelf margins and from floating ice carrying debris (e.g. Gales et al., 2021). Sediment remobilised within the slope can also be distributed to a slope-confined canyon by contour currents if the canyon is coupled with a contourite system (e.g. Wang et al., 2018; Warratz et al., 2019; Serra et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022, and references therein).\nDespite the role of sediment gravity flows in canyon growth and sinuosity increase, mean values of average canyon sinuosity are very similar across the two groups. This indicates that the importance of connections of the canyon to the shelf as a control on its sinuosity might be limited, in contrast with current understanding. Specifically, the process of canyon shelf-breaching, by enabling linkages with shelf and terrestrial sediment sources, has been suggested to lead to distinctively higher sinuosities in shelf-incising canyons compared to slope-confined ones (e.g. Farre et al., 1983; Orange et al., 1994; Wiles et al., 2019). On this basis, the sinuosity of canyons has been utilised to deduct canyon head location relative to the shelf-break on a regional scale in absence of sufficient bathymetric data coverage of proximal parts of canyons (see Wiles et al., 2019). Based on our analyses, it appears that the overall canyon sinuosity is not a suitable predictor of the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break.\nMore generally, considering the findings of this work in light of those of earlier studies (Harris and Whiteway, 2011; Harris et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014), it is concluded that whether a canyon is incised in the shelf is not a strong predictor of canyon geomorphology overall. Further investigation is necessary to determine the degree to which the volume of a canyon delimited by its 3D surface is related to the relative position of the canyon head on a global scale.\n\n\n\n7.2\nContinental-margin type\n\n7.2.1\nObservations\nSubmarine canyons located along passive margins tend to be overall deeper (Fig. 18e), have steeper thalwegs (Fig. 18g) and greater maximum sidewall steepness (Fig. 18h), with statistically significant differences in mean values. Groups of canyons associated with active and passive margins exhibit frequency distributions of maximum canyon dimensions (Figs. 18a, b & d) and average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 18f) that are rather similar. Studied active-margin canyons are on average longer (Fig. 18a) and overall wider (Fig. 18c). Average values for maximum canyon width (Fig. 18b) and depth (Fig. 18d) are almost identical across continental-margin types, but canyons from active margins display greater ranges in both morphometric parameters.\nOn average, continental slopes associated with studied canyons along passive margins tend to be significantly steeper than those along active margins (~3.22\u00b0 vs. ~5.16\u00b0, respectively; Two-sample t-test: T-Value: -4.13 DF= 70 P-Value \u22640.001; N active= 44; N passive= 47).\n\n\n7.2.2\nInterpretations\nThe results suggest that the margin type is not a primary predictor of maximum canyon dimensions or canyon sinuosity. Studied canyons along passive margins tend to display larger average depths and steeper canyon thalweg gradients compared to their active-margin counterparts, which tend to have greater average widths. The varied influence of the continental-margin type on different aspects of canyon geomorphology can be explained as follows:\nThe seafloor relief, which influences sediment transport pathways, hydrodynamic processes and canyon geomorphology, can be sculpted by different processes, which are not limited to one particular continental-margin setting: faulting, although prominent in active-margin environments can also occur along passive margins (e.g. Osmundsen and Redfield, 2011); diapirism can be variably linked to processes acting in both margin types, such as mud and salt movements.\nAnother aspect to consider is that the physiography of continental margins can vary significantly in both tectonic settings. Although continental shelves along passive margins tend to be wider and with gentler lower-shelf gradients compared to those of active margins (e.g. Inman and Nordstrom, 1971; Blum and Hattier-Womack, 2009; Harris et al., 2014; Harris and Macmillan-Lawler, 2016; Nyberg et al., 2018), other shelf morphotypes exist. For example, shelves associated with passive margins can be as narrow as those associated with active margins (e.g. Harris and Macmillan-Lawler, 2016). The continental slopes of active margins are, on average, 1.28 times narrower (36 km) than those of passive margins (46 km); maximum widths are 368 km and 254 km, respectively (Harris et al., 2014). Given the strong relationship between slope width and canyon length (see section 6.3), similarity in the ranges and mean values of canyon length for the two margin types may be partly related to the limited difference in slope width between active and passive margins. By contrast, the steeper average thalweg gradients of passive-margin canyons likely reflect how the average canyon thalweg gradient is related to the overall slope gradient (cf. section 6.3), and that in the dataset overall gradients of continental slopes associated with canyons along passive margins tend to be higher compared to those along active ones. Considering the observed variability in relationships between aspects of catchment, shelf and slope configuration and canyon morphometric parameters (sections 6.2 & 6.3), contrasting characteristics in margin physiography are not evidently tied to particular geomorphologic characteristics in canyons.\nThe tendency of canyons from passive margins to have greater maximum sidewall steepness compared to canyons in active-margin settings might be explained by the effect of recurrent seismic activity on the stabilisation of seafloor substrate: although active margins are characterised by recurrent and high-magnitude seismic activity, the occurrence of submarine mass-transport processes can be subdued (e.g. Strozyk et al., 2010). The influence of background seismic activity on slope stability and mass-transport processes is variable and complex: seismic strengthening by recurrent earthquakes has been proposed as an effective mechanism leading to slope stabilisation and a decrease in both scale and occurrence of slope-failure processes (e.g. Strozyk et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2011; Molenaar et al., 2019). Recurrent seismic activity can decrease the potential oversteepening of slopes by inducing a steady remobilisation and redistribution of slope deposits (Strozyk et al., 2010). However, at the same time the magnitude of earthquakes controls mass-failure processes, whereby higher-magnitude earthquakes tend to trigger larger-scale slope failures (e.g. Strozyk et al., 2010; Molenaar et al., 2019). Thus, slope failure may play a less important role in controlling canyon morphology on active margins compared to passive margins. Furthermore, earthquakes of small to high magnitudes do occur on passive margins (e.g. Stein et al., 1989; Wolin et al., 2012; Katz and Hamiel, 2018) and might act as a trigger of sediment remobilisation (e.g. Katz and Hamiel, 2018).\nOur findings suggest that submarine-canyon geomorphology does not differ fundamentally between active and passive margins.\n\n\n\n7.3\nSource-to-sink system setting\n\n7.3.1\nObservations\nSubmarine canyons in continental and insular settings display similar frequency distributions of canyon morphometric parameters. Between the two groups, mean values only differ by a factor 1.08 or lower, except for the average canyon thalweg gradient, which is on average 1.17 times greater in continental-setting canyons. Frequency distributions of average canyon width and depth could not be evaluated due to lack of data for insular canyons (Fig. 19a-h).\nFor studied canyons with a sediment connection to one or several fluvial systems, the size of associated terrestrial catchments tends to be markedly greater in continental settings \u2013 on average by a factor of ~100 (341.842 km2 compared to 3071 km2; Two-sample t-test: T-Value= 4.04 DF= 29 P-Value\u22640.001; N continental= 31 and N insular= 10). Whereas more data is needed to corroborate this finding, the results demonstrate that continental catchments display a great variability in size; studied catchments vary from 84 km2 to 3,800,000 km2. Insular shelves tend to be narrower and steeper than shelves offshore continental landmasses. The shelves of continental settings are on average 4.51 times wider than those of insular settings (108 km compared to 24 km; Two-sample t-test: T-Value=8.20 DF=56 P-Value\u22640.001; N continental= 166 and N insular= 37). Mean overall shelf gradients of insular shelves at the canyon location are 1.8 times greater (0.756\u00b0 compared to 0.420\u00b0; Two-sample t-test: T-Value=-3.21 DF= 33 P-Value= 0.003; N continental= 96 and N insular= 21).\n\n\n7.3.2\nInterpretations\nThe results indicate that the association of a submarine canyon with a continental landmass or an island is not reflected in important differences in canyon geomorphology, with the caveat that relationships between S2S system setting and average canyon dimensions remain to be assessed. The similarity in frequency distributions and mean values for individual canyon morphometric parameters across the two groups might reflect how controlling factors are not significantly impacted by the S2S system setting, but also that different controls can generate similar geomorphologic characteristics in canyons across different S2S system settings.\nThe inherently limited extent of the terrestrial catchment in insular S2S systems compared to continental S2S systems does not appear to be a major factor for submarine canyon geomorphology. In part, this may be linked to the variability of the scale of islands, with large islands having potentially sizable catchments, and smaller catchments also occurring on continental landmasses.\nFor canyons associated with volcanic islands (97% of the investigated insular canyons in the study), volcanic activity may be the dominant source of sediment (e.g. Aiello et al., 2020). In such case, uplift and denudation rates are of lesser importance as controlling factors on sediment fluxes to canyons.\nIn addition, findings from the regional canyon study by Smith et al. (2017) indicate that the prevalence of igneous bedrock lithology in terrestrial source areas might inhibit canyon formation. In volcanic rocks, weathered clay minerals might enhance seafloor cohesion, whereas the lack of mud in plutonic bedrock might inhibit the development of turbidity currents (Smith et al., 2017, and references therein). Hence, the transitioning of hyperpycnal flows (e.g. Zhao et al., 2018), dilute surface river plumes (e.g. Hizzet et al., 2018) and submarine mass failures (e.g. Puig et al., 2014) into turbidity currents might constitute a subordinate evolutionary process in canyons located in front of islands of a volcanic origin. On the other hand, the tendency of volcanic islands to experience slope failures along their flanks (e.g. Le Bas et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2021) and shelf margins (e.g. Quartau et al., 2015) can supply sediment to a canyon by both individual large-scale failures (e.g. Le Bas et al., 2007) and high-frequency smaller failures (e.g. Chang et al., 2021). The importance of volcanic activity as a trigger for submarine slope failures, however, might be subordinate where other factors prevail, as storm events and onshore failure (Clare et al., 2018). Additionally, sediment transported by oceanic currents can represent a sustained source of sediment to insular canyons, independently of their origin.\nNarrow and steep insular shelves promote sediment dispersal to the shelf margin, increased shear stress of sediment gravity flows, and shelfal sediment remobilisation (e.g. Hale et al., 2012; Babonneau et al., 2013). These factors may facilitate canyon activity, countering the effects of the reduced size of terrestrial catchments and limited seafloor erodibility.\n\n\n\n7.4\nOceanographic environment\n\n7.4.1\nObservations\nDistributions of canyon length (Fig. 20a), maximum width (Fig. 20b), average sinuosity (Fig. 20f) and average thalweg gradient (Fig. 20g) for open-sea canyons and canyons from semi-enclosed or enclosed seas are similar: apart from the thalweg gradient, the mean values of these parameters do not differ to a statistically significant level across the two groups. The average canyon width is greater for canyons located in semi-enclosed and enclosed seas compared to those in open seas, but this observation is based on a small dataset (Fig. 20c); conversely, the average depth of open-sea canyons is higher. The differences in mean values of average canyon depth and width across the two groups are only statistically significant for the former. In contrast, marked differences in distributions of maximum canyon depth are seen across the two groups: on average, the maximum canyon depth is 1.91 times higher in open-sea canyons (Fig. 20d). Open-sea canyons also tend to have steeper sidewalls than canyons from semi-enclosed and enclosed seas, by a factor of 1.73 on average (Fig. 20h). These differences are statistically significant.\nContinental slopes located in open-sea settings have on average greater slope-break depths than continental slopes associated with semi-enclosed and enclosed seas (3959 m compared to 3072 m, respectively; T-Value=3.92 DF=98 P-Value\u22640.001; N open sea = 85; N se&e seas = 70).\n\n\n7.4.2\nInterpretations\nThe results suggest that conditions associated with the oceanographic environment may exert an influence on maximum canyon depth, the average canyon gradient and the steepness of canyon margins, but not on canyon length, maximum width and overall sinuosity.\nFundamental differences between the two environments lie in the scale of the water body, in its degree of confinement, and in the presence of thermohaline circulation and major oceanic currents in oceans (e.g. Rahmstorf, 2006; Faug\u00e8res and Mulder, 2011). In contrast, upwelling and internal waves can affect canyons in both open-oceanic (e.g. Hickey, 1997; Smith et al., 2018) and semi-enclosed seas (e.g. Flexas et al., 2008; Li et al., 2022). Our findings might indicate that controlling factors that predominantly affect canyon geomorphology by acting along directions that are transverse to the canyon axis, like slope-parallel currents and lateral slope failures, might have a greater impact on canyon geomorphology in open seas. Oceanic currents might transport greater volumes of sand-sized sediment due to their greater extent and great depth range (e.g. Faug\u00e8res and Mulder, 2011) compared to those in semi-enclosed and enclosed seas, which can be deposited onto intracanyon ridges and canyon margins thereby increasing canyon depths and steepening canyon sidewalls by aggradation. Oversteepened margins are in turn more prone to collapse, which can lead to steeper margins over the affected area of the canyon.\nThe greater sidewall steepness of open-sea canyons might also reflect how the studied high-latitude (sections 5.3 & 7.5) and passive-margin canyons (section 7.2), which tend to have steeper margins, are dominantly located in open-sea settings.\nIt must be recognised, additionally, that the findings may emerge not because of causal relationships with processes associated with the oceanographic environment, but merely because of positive scaling between canyon depth and sidewall steepness (section 4).\n\n\n\n7.5\nLatitudinal zones\nVariations in canyon morphometric parameters are evaluated for latitudinal belts assigned to tropical (0-23.5\u00b0), temperate (23.5\u00b0-66.5\u00b0), and polar (>66.5\u00b0) zones. The dataset contains fewer data from canyons from polar latitudes compared to canyons in tropical and temperate zones; this reflects the paucity of investigations of high-latitude submarine canyons, despite the large number of canyons in the Arctic and Antarctic regions (see Harris and Whiteway, 2011; Harris et al., 2014). The arctic canyons in this study are from only two regions: the NW Norwegian margin (N=15) and the Barrow Canyon from the N Alaskan margin. Thus, the representativeness of the data is likely to be limited. Because of this geographic bias, differences in mean values of canyon morphometric parameters from tropical and temperate latitudes have been tested separately.\n\n7.5.1\nObservations\nResults of one-way ANOVA for canyons grouped by latitude range show statistically significant differences in mean values of length (Fig. 21a), maximum canyon width (Fig. 21b) and maximum canyon sidewall steepness (Fig. 21h), but not for maximum canyon depth (Fig. 21d).\nBased on two-sample t-tests, statistically significant differences are seen for mean values of length (Fig. 21a) and average canyon sinuosity (Fig. 21f) between canyons of tropical and temperate latitudes. The difference in mean values of average canyon thalweg gradient is associated with a p value that is just above the threshold of statistical significance (Fig. 21g).\n\n\n7.5.2\nInterpretations\nThe observed significant differences in canyon morphometrics may represent a record of latitude-related controls on aspects of canyon geomorphology. Considering the relationship between continental-slope gradient and average canyon thalweg gradient (section 6.3.2), the typically steeper thalwegs of tropical canyons, compared to temperate ones, might be related to the known latitudinal control on carbonate distribution to deep-marine environments (see Figure 3 of O\u2019Mara and Dunne, 2019), in light of how carbonate can act to stabilise the slope substrate by binding and cementation (e.g. Adams and Kenter, 2013, and references therein).\nBased on the results of the statistical analyses, submarine canyons do not vary markedly across tropical and temperate latitudinal zones with regards to their maximum width and depth, maximum sidewall steepness, or average sinuosity. Limited latitudinal variations in canyon sinuosity are also documented in the geographic regions examined by Harris and Whiteway (2011).\nIn contrast, both oversteepening of canyon margins related to high and dispersed sediment supply from glaciated margins (e.g. Martinsen, 2005; Armitage et al., 2010; Gales et al., 2021) and gravitational slope failure from ice loading (Mulder and Moran, 1995) may cause canyon sidewalls to be steeper in high-latitude settings compared to low- and mid-latitude ones. Yet any such inference has to be viewed with caution (see section 5.3 for a more detailed discussion).\n\n\n\n7.6\nWidth-to-depth ratios\nTo investigate potential relationships between the ratio between maximum canyon width to maximum canyon depth (wd\nmax\n) and environmental factors, 100 submarine canyons of the study for which both maximum width and depth values have been obtained have been considered; aspect ratios have been evaluated for canyons across classes of environments (Fig. 22a-f).\n\n7.6.1\nObservations\nAlthough wd\nmax\n ratios for the studied canyons vary over a broad range (2.45 to 73.33), mean and median values of wd\nmax\n ratios are in the order of magnitude of 101 both for the whole dataset as well as for canyons grouped according to environmental factors. Mean values range between 11 and 20, and only differ significantly from each other for canyons in open seas versus semi-enclosed and enclosed seas (Fig. 22e). For canyons grouped into tropical, temperate and polar latitudinal zones, the difference in mean values yields a p-value of 0.011 (Fig. 22f).\n\n\n7.6.2\nInterpretations\nThe narrow range in mean and median wd\nmax\n ratios and the lack of significant differences in mean values for the majority of canyon environmental classes indicate that maximum width-to-maximum depth ratios in canyons are of limited diagnostic value for inferring the environmental settings. This might reflect that width-to-depth ratios in canyons are not particularly sensitive to environmental controls and that they may inherently scale with processes that control canyon geomorphology globally. This would imply that width-to-depth ratios in submarine canyons are predominantly controlled by canyon self-organisation and autogenic processes, from the interplay of canyon-floor and margin aggradation and wall failure with intra-canyon sediment gravity flows, as suggested for submarine channels by Shumaker et al. (2018).\nThe inferred influence of the oceanographic environment on canyon width-to-depth ratios might reflect the way in which both erosional and depositional processes that operate along canyon margins are more strongly affected by the hydrodynamic regime in open seas than semi-enclosed and enclosed ones (see discussion in section 7.4).\n\n\n\n\n8\nSummary and conclusions\nTo increase understanding of the factors that exert control on canyon geomorphology and their relative importance on a global scale, statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, and between these and attributes describing the physiographic setting of the canyon, including characteristics of elements of the source-to-sink (S2S) system (catchment, shelf and slope), the bathymetric setting of the canyon and its distance to the shoreline, the canyon-apex location relative to the shelf-break, the continental-margin type, the oceanographic environment, and the latitude of the canyon apex. In addition, selected morphometric parameters describing submarine canyons have been quantitatively characterised, both on a global scale and for different environmental settings (canyon-apex location relative to the shelf-break, continental-margin type, source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment and climate zones). Certain forms of scaling in attributes of canyon geomorphology are recognisable on a global scale and across different environmental settings and source-to-sink system configurations (Fig. 23a&b and Fig. 24a&b).\nKey findings of the study are as follows:\n\n(1)\nScaling relationships between canyon morphometric attributes tend to be weak, due to the varied influence of environmental allogenic controls and autogenic processes influencing canyon geomorphology. Nevertheless, despite specific regional or local conditions, some scaling relationships between canyon morphometric attributes are more likely recognisable on a global scale than others; these include, for example, scaling between maximum canyon dimensions, or between maximum sidewall steepness and maximum canyon width and depth.\n\n\n(2)\nThe tendency of canyons to have greater maximum widths and depths with increasing canyon-mouth seafloor depth, the overall weakness in scaling of canyon morphometry with the terrestrial catchment and continental shelf, and the steeper canyon walls seen in canyons associated with open-sea settings compared to canyons in semi-enclosed or enclosed seas, possibly reflect how hydrodynamic processes such as upwelling, longshore drifts and along-slope currents influence canyon geomorphology.\n\n\n(3)\nCanyon morphometric parameters may reflect the interplay of different environmental factors. Hence, controls on canyon geomorphology cannot be described by generic models linking geomorphological characteristics to individual environmental parameters. Potential controls on certain canyon morphometric parameters include: the location of the canyon head relative to the shelf break, the continental-margin type, the oceanographic environment, the absolute latitude of the canyon apex, and the depth of the associated shelf break. Data on canyon length, sinuosity, thalweg gradient and maximum sidewall steepness indicate that these morphometric aspects are likely influenced by several environmental controls.\n\n\n\nKey findings regarding relationships between the environmental setting and canyon geomorphology include:\n\n(i)\nMaximum canyon dimensions and overall canyon sinuosity cannot be used to predict the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break and vice versa; this challenges concepts linking higher overall sinuosities in canyons to incision of the canyon into the shelf (e.g. Farre et al., 1983; Jobe et al., 2011; Wiles et al., 2019).\n\n\n(ii)\nThe tendency of passive-margin canyons to develop steeper sidewalls compared to those of active-margin canyons indicates that slope failure might be generally less important for canyons from active margins compared to passive-margin ones, perhaps due to recurrent seismic strengthening of the seafloor substrate, which might act to inhibit mass failures, with the exception of mass failures triggered by high-magnitude earthquakes (e.g. Strozyk et al., 2010; Molenaar et al., 2019).\n\n\n(iii)\nWhether a submarine canyon is associated with a continental or insular setting does not exert control on overall canyon geomorphology. Volcanic sediment sources and narrow and steep insular shelves might compensate for the impact of smaller associated terrestrial catchments on sediment supply to submarine canyons, and for the potential effect igneous bedrock lithology might have on canyon evolution along volcanic islands by affecting seafloor erodibility and the erosive strengths of flows (Smith et al., 2017, and references therein).\n\n\n(iv)\nThe complex interrelationships between climate-controlled processes are reflected in the weakness of linear and monotonic scaling of latitude with canyon morphometrics and can explain why the latitudinal position of a canyon is not a reliable indicator of overall canyon geomorphology in canyons in tropical and temperate latitudes. The complex role of climate influence on sediment sourcing and dispersal along glaciated continental margins, paired with the effect of ice loading on triggering of mass failures, might explain the observed steeper margins of submarine canyons from higher latitudes. However, in view of geographic bias and the limited sample size, it is possible that the results reflect how the studied higher-latitude canyons are coincidentally associated with passive-margin and open-sea settings, which tend to be associated with distinct distributions in sidewall steepness.\n\n\n(v)\nMean values of maximum width-to-maximum depth ratios in canyons are consistently in the order of magnitude of 101 for all investigated canyon classes \u2013 regardless of canyon-head location relative to the shelf break, the tectonic-margin type, the S2S setting, the oceanographic environment and the latitudinal zone \u2013 albeit with significant global variability in documented values. This might reflect how width-to-depth ratios in submarine canyons are constrained by the interplay of canyon-margin failure and canyon-floor and canyon-margin aggradation by flows.\n\n\n\nOur quantitative characterisation of how canyon morphometric parameters vary as a function of environmental factors demonstrates that the interplay of controls on canyon geomorphology is more complex than hitherto considered in canyon classification schemes (e.g. Jobe et al., 2011), numerical (e.g. Wan et al., 2021) and published conceptual models of canyon evolution (e.g. Chiang and Yu, 2006; Micallef et al., 2014), of deep-water systems and of source-to-sink (S2S) systems (e.g. S\u00f8mme et al., 2009; Nyberg et al., 2018). The predictive value of these models can be enhanced by considering the impact of the controlling factors identified in this study \u2013 including the hydrodynamic regime of oceans and seas, autogenic canyon processes, characteristics of continental margin physiography and the canyon physiographic setting.\nThe findings of this study might also aid in estimation of the original geometry of ancient canyons and channel forms whose infills are now preserved in subsurface and outcrop, and in the interpretation of their formative environments, particularly where information on the environmental setting, margin physiography and bathymetry are limited due to scarcity of data (e.g. Martinsen et al., 2010; Helland-Hansen et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017).\nResults of this work will aid analyses of source-to-sink systems, i.e., spanning fluvial, paralic and deep-water domains (e.g. S\u00f8mme et al., 2009; Nyberg et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019), by illuminating the response of slope systems to controlling factors on sedimentary processes from terrestrial hinterlands to deep-water environments. Further research is needed to investigate the relative scaling between features of these clastic environments and those of submarine canyons, and of the relative influence of marine hydrodynamic processes on submarine-canyon geomorphology.\n\n","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nWe appreciate the comments by G. Shanmugam on the paper \u201cA new classification system for mixed (turbidite-contourite) depositional systems: Examples, conceptual models and diagnostic criteria for modern and ancient records\u201d by S. Rodrigues, F.J. Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina, M. Fonnesu, E. Miramontes, M. Rebesco, D. C. Campbell [Earth-Science Reviews (2022), 104,030]\u201d. Most of the comments from G. Shanmugam refer to the sedimentary facies scale, with special emphasis on the distinct types of deposits and their definitions. It was quite a surprise that G. Shanmugam's comments did not include any remarks about the descriptions or discussions elaborated in Rodrigues et al. (2022a), such as the large-scale morphological features recognized in mixed (turbidite-contourite) depositional systems through bathymetric or seismic data or the newly proposed classification scheme. Rodrigues et al. (2022a) has a very brief sub-section on the sedimentary facies recognized in mixed systems (e.g., Section 5.4 Sedimentary facies and deposits of mixed systems, page 22), which is based on a few key contributions from past literature (such as Mutti and Carminatti, 2012; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022b). His comments appear to be a compilation of his own assertions and do not provide a clear link to the contribution of Rodrigues et al. (2022a) or to the study of mixed depositional systems.\nInitially, G. Shanmugam focuses his comments on the multitude of turbidite and bottom current processes that occur in contourite and turbidite settings, as well as their definitions and models. He states that Rodrigues et al., (2022a) proposed a new classification for mixed depositional systems \u201cbased on their notion that there is only one type of turbidite and that there is only one type of contourite in deep-marine systems\u201d, but the authors have never made such a statement in their manuscript. He also reports that Rodrigues et al. (2022a) \u201cfailed to provide a clear and precise definition of the terms turbidite, contourite, and bottom current\u201d, but nevertheless the authors have provided definitions and references for those terms. Accordingly, G. Shanmugam outlined four distinct problems in Rodrigues et al. (2022a) review paper, namely (1) the turbidite problem, (2) the contourite problem, (3) the bottom-current problem, and (4) the seismic geometry vs. sedimentology problem.\nAs indicated above, G. Shanmugam's criticism is focused on turbidite and bottom current processes in non-mixed settings, while very few points are made about these processes in mixed depositional systems. As clearly stated in the Introduction of Rodrigues et al. (2022a), the aim of this review paper was to \u201ccompile all currently known cases\u201d, \u201cpresent new undocumented examples\u201d and \u201ccompare their lateral migration, stratigraphic stacking patterns and seismic facies\u201d. In addition, \u201ca new classification system is proposed, along with clear diagnostic criteria, to address some of the previous inconsistencies and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of mixed systems\u201d. Therefore, we believe G. Shanmugam has misinterpreted the aims of this review paper and raised issues unrelated to or not covered in this study. He uses this comment to highlight points that are controversial in literature or that follow opinions different from his own publications, in order to open a discussion that is not fully relevant to the identification or recognition of mixed systems. In fact, the problems raised in Shanmugam's comments have been a recurrent point of debate for several years now. Deep-water processes, their definitions and models have been profusely discussed by him and other authors since the 50s (Kuenen and Migliorini, 1950; Bouma, 1962; Middleton and Hampton, 1973; Lowe, 1982; Cullis et al., 2018). We do agree that there is a high degree of variability in deep-water turbidite and bottom current processes, both in contourite and turbidite settings, as well as in mixed depositional settings. However, the paper by Rodrigues et al. (2022a) focuses solely on reviewing the interactions between turbidite and bottom currents in mixed depositional systems to improve their recognition and classification and, therefore, does not approach these processes separately in other depositional environments (e.g., in pure contourite or turbidite settings). The authors will therefore not partake in the debate surrounding the definitions and models of these processes in non-mixed depositional environments. However, the authors will reply to the points raised about these processes in mixed depositional systems, specifically points 1\u20134 in problem 1, points 1\u20132 in problem 2, points 7\u20139 in problem 3 and point 12 in problem 4.\n\n\n2\nProblem 1: The turbidite problem\nG. Shanmugam indicates that Rodrigues et al. (2022a) lacks sufficient cover on turbidite papers and should include further references for their facies, models and types. Considering that Rodrigues et al. (2022a) is focused solely on the interactions between turbidites and bottom currents in mixed systems, it cannot cover a full review of turbidite facies or models in dominant turbidite settings, which do not take into consideration the potential interactions that may occur between turbidity and bottom currents. Furthermore, Rodrigues et al. (2022a) cannot refer to turbidite deposits or types that have yet to be observed in mixed systems due to the lack of evidence or case studies. The study of mixed systems is considered relatively \u201cnew\u201d with only ~47 currently known cases in existence (see Fig. 1 and Table S1). Nevertheless, Rodrigues et al. (2022a) has included several references to extensive reviews of turbidite models and deposits, such as Haughton et al. (2009), Meiburg and Kneller (2010), Covault et al. (2012), Cullis et al. (2018) and Hubbard et al. (2020), among others (see pages 1, 6, 7 and 10). These contributions have mentioned the references requested by G. Shanmugam, along with other pioneering works (such as Lowe 1982; Mutti and Normark 1987; Pickering et al. 1995, among others) and have furthermore discussed the points raised in Problem 1.\nG. Shanmugam also suggests that the authors should clarify which definitions did they adopt for the identification of turbidites. In Section 3.3 Nomenclature, Rodrigues et al. (2022a) clearly outlined that they have taken into consideration the studies of Macauley and Hubbard (2013), Hubbard et al. (2014, 2020) and Cullis et al. (2018), which have studied the hierarchical classifications and definitions of turbidites and their depositional systems. In addition, our review paper also refers to the pioneering works of Bouma (1972), Middleton and Hampton (1973), Mutti et al. (1980), Postma (1986) and Mutti (1992), among others. Rodrigues et al. (2022a) also considers the recent studies by Azpiroz-Zabala et al. (2017a, 2017b), de Castro et al. (2020), Fonnesu et al. (2020), Fuhrmann et al. (2020), Miramontes et al. (2020) and Rodrigues et al. (2022b) dealing with facies analysis, grain-size and empirical field data (along with several others in pages 4\u20136, 18\u201322 and 23\u201324), as they have investigated turbidites in mixed systems through sediment cores, well data, moorings and flume tank experiments. The authors therefore disagree with the problem raised by G. Shanmugam, as they have provided extensive references for turbidite processes and their deposits.\n\n\n3\nProblem 2: The contourite problem\nRegarding contourites, G. Shanmugam states that Rodrigues et al. (2022a) needs to define the term \u201ccontourite\u201d and that the authors basically follow the definition of Hollister (1967). In Section 3.3 Nomenclature, the authors clearly outline that they followed the definitions presented in Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999) and Rebesco et al. (2014), which consider that contourites and their features are defined as \u201cformed or substantially reworked by the persistent action of along-slope bottom currents\u201d (see page 4 of Rodrigues et al. 2022a). These works made a comprehensive review on contourites and bottom-current processes and take into consideration all of the previously proposed definitions (including Heezen and Hollister 1964; Hollister 1967; Lovell and Stow 1981; and Faug\u00e8res et al. 1999, among others). In addition, G. Shanmugam asserts that if Rodrigues et al. (2022a) adopted the broader definition of Lovell and Stow (1981), the authors must explain why they consider tidalites as contourites. This is a gross assumption as Lovell and Stow (1981) is cited only in Fig. 2 of Rodrigues et al. (2022a), which shows all of the previous studies that have mentioned or investigated mixed depositional systems since the 70s. Moreover, Lovell and Stow (1981) focused primarily on the identification of ancient sandy contourites in various depositional settings, all in \u201crelatively deep water, certainly below wave base\u201d (quoted from page 3 of Lovell and Stow 1981) and therefore do not consider contourites to be sediments deposited by tidal currents.\n\n\n4\nProblem 3: The bottom-current problem\n\nRebesco et al. (2014), Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2016) and Yin et al. (2019) have clarified that water masses are a consequence of the thermohaline circulation and normally represent geostrophic flow (Wunsch 2002; Rahmstorf 2006; Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007; Cochran et al. 2019). But there are a number of hydrographic processes that modulate water mass circulation, such as benthic storms, overflows, interfaces between water masses, vertical eddies, horizontal vortices, tides and internal tides, internal waves and solitons and tsunami related traction currents. Water masses move continuously through the oceans' basins (Rahmstorf 2006; Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007) and any persistent current near the seafloor can be considered a bottom current (Rebesco et al. 2008). Bottom currents are therefore defined as semi-permanent water-mass flows, capable of eroding, transporting and depositing up to gravel-sized sediment in seafloor environments (Rebesco et al. 2008; Rebesco et al. 2014). Rodrigues et al. (2022a) clearly delineates this definition in the Introduction (see page 1) and furthermore supports it with relevant, key references (such as Rebesco et al. (2014), Shanmugam (2008), etc.).\nIn Rodrigues et al. (2022a), mixed systems are usually depicted as a result of distinct interactions between along-slope bottom currents (marked by blue arrows) and down-slope gravity currents (drawn as red arrows), as shown in Fig. 18 and also in Figs. 15\u201317. Nearly 30\u00a0years ago, Shanmugam et al. (1993) also proposed a conceptual model for the formation of mixed systems through the interaction of bottom and turbidity currents. But the problem with the model portrayed in Shanmugam et al. (1993) is that it considers mixed systems to be a result of bottom current reworking only. Furthermore, G. Shanmugam defines hybrid flows and their deposits as \u201chybridites\u201d (Shanmugam 2021). However, the term \u201chybridite\u201d has not been adopted by other authors and could create more confusion due to the more famous definition of \u201chybrid events beds\u201d, which characterize gravity flows generated beds that incur a flow transformation from frictional to mostly cohesive flows (Haughton et al. 2009; Fonnesu et al. 2015, 2018). Most continental margins host complex interactions between along- and down-slope processes, which create numerous features and deposits across deep-marine settings. Frequent interactions may form mixed depositional systems composed of bottom current reworked sands (BCRS), pure turbidites and contourites or other deep-water deposits (Viana et al. 1998; Mulder et al. 2008; de Castro et al. 2020; Rodrigues et al. 2022b). Some studies have drawn a distinction between mixed and hybrid systems (Sansom 2018; Fonnesu et al. 2020; Fuhrmann et al. 2020). These studies tend to assert that mixed systems deal with a wider spectrum of features and deposits formed under synchronous and asynchronous interactions (Mulder et al. 2008; Rodrigues et al. 2022a), whereas hybrid systems only form under synchronous interactions (Sansom 2018; Fonnesu et al. 2020; Fuhrmann et al. 2020). Key examples of mixed depositional systems have been identified offshore Argentina (Rodrigues et al. 2021), Uruguay (Creaser et al. 2017), Mozambique (Fonnesu et al. 2020; Miramontes et al. 2021), Tanzania (Sansom 2018; Fuhrmann et al. 2020), Antarctic Peninsula (Rebesco et al. 1998, 2002; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2017; Rodrigues et al. 2022b, 2022c), Southeast Greenland (Rasmussen et al. 2003) and Canada (Deptuck and Kendell 2020; Rodrigues et al. 2022d), as well as along the Southwest Iberian margin (Mencaroni et al. 2021) and in the South China Sea (Gong et al. 2013). Innovative experiments by Miramontes et al. (2020) have furthermore demonstrated how mixed systems form in response to down- and along-slope sedimentary processes and that when along- and down-slope currents are contemporaneous, their channels migrate in an up-current direction. Rodrigues et al. (2022a) has therefore taken into consideration the complexity surrounding mixed systems (based on recent and ancient examples) and proposed a three-part classification scheme for mixed systems based on their location, elongation, dimensions, lateral migration, spatial and temporal variability: 1) contourite-dominated mixed systems, 2) synchronous systems, and 3) turbidite-dominated mixed systems. Diverse interactions between along- and down-slope processes appear to occur across these systems, from synchronous (where the bottom and turbidity currents occur coevally in time and space) to asynchronous and passive interactions (where the bottom and turbidity currents do not interact in time and more rarely, in space). These interactions are responsible for building a myriad of deposits across proximal to distal depositional settings, such as mixed \/ hybrid sedimentary facies, interfingering sequences of contourites and turbidites or reworked turbidite deposits. This new classification scheme can thus be used in ongoing studies or future research to better understand the interactions between down- and along-slope processes as well as their resulting products.\nAs reported above, Rodrigues et al. (2022a) does not follow the concept of Lovell and Stow (1981). We are therefore surprised that G. Shanmugam still assumes that tidal currents correspond to up- and down-flows along submarine canyons or channels. Tides are omnipresent in the global ocean (Dykstra 2012), with varying degrees of influence, and are capable of controlling water mass circulation along the slope, as previously reported by oceanographers (e.g., Jonkers et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2016), marine sedimentologists (e.g., Rebesco et al. 2014; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. 2016; Yin et al. 2019; de Weger et al. 2021) and numerical simulations (e.g., Chen et al. 2016).\n\n\n5\nProblem 4: The seismic geometry vs. process sedimentology problem\nG. Shanmugam's comments about depositional processes being interpreted solely from seismic facies of ancient strata is also out of the scope of Rodrigues et al. (2022a). There are many types of seismic data (2D vs. 3D), which have significantly different resolutions. This problem therefore revolves around the scale of the work and depends strongly on the seismic resolution of the available seismic dataset. Seismic analysis and seismic facies are essential to identify and recognize distinct sedimentary environments and their evolution through time on ancient strata in marine basins. Seismic data allows to decode the sedimentary processes and products at a long-term spatial scale, however it is limited by the vertical and horizontal resolution of the seismic dataset and, therefore, its resolution cannot always be compared to the sedimentary facies or facies associations identified in outcrops or exploration wells. Nevertheless, there are some case studies in past literature that were able to calibrate seismic to well data in mixed systems and which were cited in Rodrigues et al. (2022a). For example, Fonnesu et al. (2020) calibrated the seismic and core facies of the Mozambican Eocene mixed systems; Fuhrmann et al. (2020) and Sansom (2018) focused on the Tanzanian Cretaceous to Paleogene hybrid systems; Mencaroni et al. (2021) studied the modern mixed drift developed offshore SW Iberia; Mutti et al. (2014) calibrated the Brazilian Eocene-Oligocene mixed systems; de Castro et al. (2020) studied the Gulf of Cadiz's BCRS and Rodrigues et al. (2022b) investigated the modern Antarctica Peninsula mixed systems.\n\n","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nPeatlands are estimated to cover 3% of the world's total land area, forming in a broad range of latitudes (Maltby and Proctor, 1996; Joosten and Clarke, 2002; Page et al., 2007). Peat consists mainly of dead helophytic plant remnants accumulated in a mire, i.e., an area with stagnant water. A mire hosting a peat layer thicker than 30\u00a0cm is called peatland (Schneekloth, 1981; Joosten and Clarke, 2002; Rydin and Jeglum, 2013). Depending on the factors controlling the mire formation and the peat accumulation, mires, and hence peatlands, can be distinguished as topogenous and ombrogenous. The former, mostly being fens, develop in topographically low-lying areas such as at the shores of lakes, on the banks of rivers, on inundated flat areas, and are mainly fed with mineral-rich surface and spring water, thus, being minerotrophic or rheotrophic. The latter, called bogs, develop in humid areas above the groundwater table of the surrounding area (dome-shaped) and the nutrients are exclusively supplied from meteoric precipitation, thus being ombrotrophic. Transitional mires constitute the transition between fen and bog. Under certain conditions a fen can initially evolve into a transitional mire and later in a bog (Cameron et al., 1989; Moore, 1989; Kaule and G\u00f6ttlich, 1990; Kellner, 2002; Papazisimou et al., 2002).\nDespite the elevated temperatures in the tropics, which favour organic matter decay, the high humidity creates favourable conditions for peatification of the plant remnants. In general, tropical peatlands display a peat accumulation rate of 1\u20135\u00a0mm\/a (and up to 10\u00a0mm\/a), which is much higher than the rate of boreal and subarctic (< 1\u00a0mm\/a) peatlands (Diessel et al., 2000; Bourgeau-Chavez et al., 2018). Tropical peatlands occur in South and Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Central Africa (Pfadenhauer, 1990; Lappalainen, 1996). Apart from their essential role in the global biodiversity, they are significant carbon sinks, hence playing a critical role in balancing the budget of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gasses via their respiration and\/or degassing (Chimner, 2004; Couwenberg et al., 2010; Leng et al., 2019; Treat et al., 2019; Waldron et al., 2019; and references therein). Inaccessibility, due to dense jungles, meant that the tropical peatlands were discovered and explored much later than the boreal ones (Shier, 1985). Southeast Asia includes the largest areas of the tropical peatlands on Earth, thus signifying the environmental importance of the region in the preservation of biodiversity and carbon store (Page and Rieley, 2018; Page et al., 2011; Rieley and Page, 2016). Their significance, the threats and the important interaction of the Southeast Asian peatland with local and global societies are highlighted by Cole et al. (2021). Generally, the peatlands in this region are dome-shaped and are characterised by steep margins and thick centres (Anderson, 1961, 1983; Dommain et al., 2011), and are mainly distributed on the island of Borneo (including Brunei Darussalam, east Malaysia and part of Indonesia), Sumatra Island, the Archipelago of Philippines, the island of New Guinea, peninsular Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.\nThis paper compiles and reviews geological data (substrate formations, type of peatlands, ash yield, pH, age and thicknesses of the peatlands and their substrates and carbon contents from CHNS analysis) from all available studies in Southeast Asia. We aim to provide basic and comparable knowledge and a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of tropical peatlands, as well as to analyse the data and identify the literature gaps. The collected literature data are also treated to provide an overview of the Southeast Asian peatland responses to the environmental and climatic changes, as well as of the adverse effects due to anthropogenic activities. The status of the peatlands (pristine or the degree of degradation due to cultivation and\/or drainage) can help to discern future trends and assist policy makers to monitor the environmental and climatic consequences. This will contribute to monitoring and determining the threats to these peatlands, and hence to raising awareness of these valuable ecosystems. It also intends to facilitate and promote future research on the evolution of these environments, in decoding the Holocene geological and ecological history of Southeast Asia.\n\n\n2\nBackground information\nThe vast majority of peatlands in Southeast Asia occur in Indonesia (ca. 20.7 million ha), followed by Malaysia (ca. 2.6 million ha). In these areas, we found geological data from only 14 and 20 peatlands, respectively (Table 1\n). Despite its small area, Brunei Darussalam hosts and actively preserves a significant area of peatlands covering approximately 16% of the area of the country followed by Indonesia and Malaysia with a coverage of approximately 11 and 8% of their areas, respectively (Table 1). Unlike other regions in Southeast Asia, Brunei Darussalam has some of the most pristine peatlands globally, thus they are crucial for the preservation of biodiversity and the carbon cycle (Cobb et al., 2017; Cobb and Harvey, 2019). The pristine nature of the Brunei Darussalam peats can be used as a reference for all the now disturbed peats in Southeast Asia if policy makers wish to monitor the environmental and climatic consequences.\nThe investigated sites are associated with the shallow Sunda Shelf, which is a tectonically stable platform since the Pliocene-Pleistocene extending in the South China Sea and the surrounding lands (Fig. 1\n), and as a result it undergoes a continuous slow subsidence (0.2\u20130.3\u00a0mm\/year) since Pleistocene (Tjia and Liew, 1996; Sarr et al., 2019). It is bordered by the Indian and Pacific Oceans, to its west and east, respectively. The terrestrial area is one of the largest tropical regions on Earth and is highly affected by monsoons, which impose distinct periodic changes in the direction and strength of the winds, in the intensity of the rainfall, as well as temperature fluctuations. Moreover, it is influenced by the biannual inversion of the surface currents in the South China Sea (Wang et al., 1995). All these factors cause rapid topography modifications with periodic changes of accumulations and losses due to erosion of peatlands' substrates and peats themselves. The shallow, submerged areas of Sundaland are disrupted by sparse deep valleys and channels reminiscent of ancient rivers (Tjia, 1980). In contrast, during the last glacial period (LGP) and at times of lowered sea-level, peninsular Malaysia was connected to the Indonesian islands and Borneo through a narrow \u2018savanna corridor\u2019, likely offering routes for human migration, as well (Heaney, 1991; Bird et al., 2005). A variety of environments (coastal, deltaic, and tidal) during the Middle Pleistocene to Holocene have been revealed, which are related to sea-level fluctuations (Hanebuth and Stattegger, 2003). These changes and the associated geological processes (such as the tectonics, sedimentary processes and volcanic activity) have largely influenced the biological history and biodiversity of the Sunda Shelf highlighting the strong interrelationship of the geological mechanisms with the biological evolution (Husson et al., 2019; Sarr et al., 2019; Morley and Morley, 2022).\nThe Greifswald Mire Centre has developed a global peatland database (https:\/\/www.greifswaldmoor.de\/global-peatland-database-en.html) and together with few local agencies (e.g., NatureScot and their Peatland ACTION project) provide data for peatlands aiming to contribute to climate protection, sustainable use of peats and conservation of biodiversity.\n\n\n3\nThe data set\nThe hypothesis of the lack of adequate geological data with regards to the evolution of peatlands in Southeast Asia is tested with the data presented in this paper, which derive from 103 papers published between 1956 and 2021 and deal with the geological aspects of 52 peatlands hosted in the Southeast Asian countries (Fig. 1 and Table A1 in supplementary appendix). The papers have been reviewed thoroughly to extract the provided information. Acquisition of the data enabled the compilation of a database, which was further used for the statistical analysis in this paper. The database includes the following information: authors, year of publication, focus of the paper, primary or secondary data, plant species, type of peatland (ombrogenous or topogenous) and the peatlands properties (ash yield, pH, thickness, age, carbon content, substrate lithology). The database contains both numerical (minimum and maximum reported values of the properties) and binary data (where 0 and 1 denote absence or existence of data, respectively). To illustrate data availability in the reviewed papers, we present in Table A2 (in supplementary appendix) the total number and percentages of papers that report specific parameters: plant information, radiometric ages, thickness, substrate type, pH, ash yield and carbon content.\nA statistical treatment of the above literature data is provided aiming to present robust support to the description of the strengths and weaknesses in the characterisation of the Southeast Asian peatlands. The parameters which are studied using PCA include maximum thickness (as a proxy of thickness report), basal age of peatlands (as a proxy of the initiation of the peat accumulation) and maximum ash yield on a dry basis (as a proxy of inorganic sediment supply reflecting climatic conditions). These parameters are chosen due to data availability and their widely recognised importance in characterising peatlands.\nPCA is applied to study the general trends of peatland characterisation with respect to the type, the basement, the geographical regions and climatic conditions during formation. Unreported values of a parameter were imputed by calculating the median values of that parameter from peatlands belonging to the same region, to maximise use of peatland data (Table A3 in supplementary appendix). If no imputed values could be calculated for a peatland, it was excluded from the PCA. This process has reduced the number of peatlands, which are considered for PCA, to 38 and the number of regions to 3 (Borneo, Malay Peninsula and Sumatra). The data is scaled before PCA is applied. The prcomp function from R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020) is applied to generate scores and loadings and the plots are generated using R libraries, ggplot2 and ggforce. The contribution values are obtained using the PCA function from FactoMineR package, taking into account the variance proportion of each PCs for each attribute. The enclosing eclipse for each climatic groups is automatically generated using the geom_mark_ellipse() function in ggforce library. This function uses the Khachiyan algorithm to calculate the convex hull of the data points belonging to the respective climatic groups. To increase legibility of text in the biplot, the overlapping text removal feature has been selected. Thus, not all peatlands are included in the biplot due to overlapping text. A similar method was also conducted by Meier and Wilson (2022) to create a PCA plot from the top 500 variable genes among samples. Without using this feature, many text will overlap one another, making analysis and interpretation of a cluttered plot difficult.\n\n\n4\nSite descriptions of peatlands of Southeast Asia\n\n4.1\nBrunei Darussalam\n\n4.1.1\nBadas\nThe Badas peatland (no 4 in Fig. 1) forms an ombrogenous dome lying at the western region of Brunei Darussalam, in the proximity of Belait River. The peat has a maximum thickness of 9.7\u00a0m (Stoneman, 1997) and is underlain by clay and locally by sand (Anderson, 1961; Suhip et al., 2020). The surface of the peatland is typically dominated by Kerangas forest and Shorea albida (Anderson, 1963; Din et al., 2018; Moran et al., 2000; Turner et al., 2000). There are extensive areas of pristine peat in the Badas bog; however, the areas near Jalan Badas and the Seria Bypass are largely affected by anthropogenic activities (i.e., nearby highway construction, occurrence of water pipelines, excavations and road constructions), and this peatland is vulnerable to wildfires and droughts (Din et al., 2018; Haji Hamzah et al., 2019; Suhip et al., 2020). The most degraded areas show generally lower groundwater levels and lower hydraulic conductivity than the more pristine ones (Suhip et al., 2020). The Shorea albida-dominated forests in Badas have also been observed to show no signs of regeneration from both natural and anthropogenic disturbance (Becek et al., 2022).\n\n\n4.1.2\nUlu Mendaram\nThe ombrogenous peatland of Ulu Mendaram (no. 5 in Fig. 1) is located at the western region of Kuala Belait, Brunei Darussalam. The peatland includes the pristine Mendaram and the degraded (due to deforestation in the 1970's) Damit sites, which were deposited during the last 2655\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035\u00a0years BP on a marine clay substrate (Dommain et al., 2015). The thickness of the peat ranges between 1 and 12\u00a0m (e.g.,\nAnderson and Muller, 1975; Furukawa, 1988; Tie and Esterle, 1992). Typical tropical plant species in these peatlands include Shorea albida and Pandanus sp. (Gandois et al., 2013; Dommain et al., 2015). The peat at the Damit site is more acidic towards the centre of the degraded dome, with a pH level ranging from 3.7 to 4.4 (Gandois et al., 2013). Ash yield shows a wider range (0.4\u20135.7%, on a dry basis) in the Damit bog relative to the narrower range (< 3.2%) of the Mendaram bog. However, both sites have a similar carbon content averaging at 50% (Gandois et al., 2013). Natural forest disturbance (e.g., intense winds or lightning) promote tree falls and the formation of tip-up pools facilitating pulses of peat accumulation (Dommain et al., 2015).\n\n\n\n4.2\nMalaysia\nThe ombrogenous and topogenous peatlands occurring in Malaysia (peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, Sabah) occupy a total area of 2,536,440\u00a0ha. In their review, Ambak and Chye (1996) report that 32% of the peatlands in peninsular Malaysia are used for agricultural purposes.\n\n4.2.1\nSarawak\nSarawak is a region in Borneo located primarily in the coastal region of northwest Borneo. Ombrogenous peatlands in Sarawak are meticulously described and studied by Anderson (1961, 1963, 1964, 1983). The peatlands in Sarawak are extensive and have been the target of several studies. They lack a systematic classification in terms of peatland name and border. In many cases the description of the peatlands is given by the locality and the river system including Forest Reserves. Individual peatland borders are not clearly outlined in the majority of the reviewed studies. Anderson (1964) gives one of the most comprehensive site descriptions for various bogs in Sarawak, however information such as their surface area is given by grouping the peatlands according to the Sarawak Administrative Division in which they occur. Despite changes in these Divisions since then, Sarawak peatlands in total, occupy 1,465,932.9\u00a0ha. Clay, clay with pyrite and silt are the main formations underlying peat, representing alluvial and mangrove sediments. Casuarina dominates, the current marine sands near the coastline along with some exceptional colonisation of Shorea albida in coastal bogs along Baram River. Secondary information sources (i.e., citations within literature), show that Sarawak Forestry and other Government organisations along with the oil companies established in Sarawak have interesting and detailed geological information on these peatlands, however this data is not accessible through the common literature providers. We acknowledge that we may have missed notable geological information. Below we review the peatland systems which are better described in the literature following an east to west direction.\n\n4.2.1.1\nLawas\nLawas comprise an ombrogenous peatland (no. 3 in Fig. 1) located in Limbang, Sarawak adjacent to the district of Temburong, Brunei Darussalam, with alluvial basement. The dominant plant species are Shorea albida and Neesia malayana (Anderson, 1963). There are no reports on the physical characteristics of this peatland.\n\n\n4.2.1.2\nBaram River Plain\nA system of ombrogenous peatlands associated with Baram River, in the Malaysian State of Sarawak on Borneo Island (no. 6 in Fig. 1). Several bogs occur along this river system, named and described after their locality. Previous works mention these peatlands as occurrences of swamps in the Sarawak 4th and 5th Divisions (e.g., Anderson, 1961, 1964) or Miri Division peatlands (e.g., Wetlands International, 2010; Wong, 2003). On a SN direction, these domes include peatlands near the Baram-Tinjar confluence, Lubok Pasir (near Marudi), Marudi, Tanjong Jabai, Tanjong Jaye (a stream bend of Baram River) and near Pagalayan Canal (potentially the current Baram Wetlands), as outlined from Anderson (1964). A later work from Esterle (1990), includes peatlands in Kuala Baram (probably the NW extension of the Pagalayan Canal), Belanok (a locality close or the same as Tanjong Jaye) and Marudi (probably the same as Lubok Pasir). Peat profiles along the Baram system show an approximate thickness of 6\u00a0m for Pagalayan canal and a sand-clay basement, 9\u00a0m for Tanjong Jaye, 6\u00a0m for Tanjong Jabai without a defined limit for the basement depth and 12\u00a0m at the center Lubok Pasir bog (Anderson, 1964). The uppermost surface of the underlying sediments in the Baram River system lies below (even up to approximately 6\u00a0m) below sea level. Unpublished reports to Sarawak Government (White et al., 1957a), report a peat dome altitude at 18\u00a0m above sea level at the Baram-Tinjar confluence; however, the peat thickness was limited to the 6\u00a0m sampling capability and the actual thickness of this peat profile is not known. Radiocarbon dating in the Lubok Pasir dome reported in Wilford (1960, 1961), indicates a basal peat age of 4270\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070\u00a0years BP, and a decreasing accumulation from an initial rate of 4.7\u00a0mm\/yr to a rate of 2.2\u00a0mm\/yr in the uppermost peat layers. Esterle (1990) reports peat ages of 4300\u00a0years BP in Marudi, 3500\u00a0years BP in Belanok and 1500\u00a0years BP in Kuala Baram areas. The Marudi bog displays a distinct convex shape covered by pole forest and Shorea albida communities, developed on alluvial mangrove mud and sand (Anderson, 1961; Esterle and Ferm, 1994). The maximum thickness reaches 12\u00a0m. The base of the peat is sapric to fine hemic, whereas transitions to hemic and fibric peat exist towards the top. The ash yield (on a dry basis) is generally <2% for the hemic, coarse hemic and fibric peat, but it ranges from 2 to 10% in the sapric and fine hemic layers (Esterle and Ferm, 1994). Briefly, peatlands of the Baram system accumulated on white and yellow clay, clay with pyrite and silt, representing alluvial and mangrove sediments. While Casuarina dominates the current marine sands near the coastline, Shorea albida thrives exceptionally near the coast colonising the bogs in Belait District in Brunei Darussalam (Anderson, 1961, 1964; Esterle and Ferm, 1994). The inland bogs are generally thicker, as they are decreasingly subjected to saline influence (Anderson and Muller, 1975).\n\n\n4.2.1.3\nSekai Forest Reserve\nSekai Forest Reserve located in Mukah, Sarawak, is an ombrogenous peatland on an alluvial substrate (no. 7 in Fig. 1). The dominant plant species are Shorea albida and Dipterocarpus coriaceus (Anderson, 1963). The physical characteristics of peat are not mentioned in the paper.\n\n\n4.2.1.4\nRajang River Plain\nThe Rajang peatland is a series of ombrogenous peatlands along the homonymous river in Sarawak, northwest Borneo (no. 8 in Fig. 1). The river stretches from Iran Mountains in east Kalimantan, to the South China Sea, being the largest river of Malaysia, formed on sedimentary (mostly consisting of siliciclastic and carbonate formations) and metamorphic rocks (Staub et al., 2000; Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011). Similar to the Baram River Plain peatlands, the peat domes in Rajang River are either described as Rajang peatland, part of the Sarawak 2nd Division peat swamps (e.g., Anderson, 1963), Sibu Division peatlands (e.g., Wetlands International, 2010), or according to the nearest locality. Anderson (1964) describes four different peatlands in the Rajang River, namely the Pulau Bruit, the Daro Forest Reserve, the Loba Kabang Forest Reserve and the Naman Forest Reserve (from inland to the coast), the Lassa Forest Reserve, the Sungai Kut and the Oya Mukah Protected Forest (on a west to east direction). In the same work, the maximum peat thickness increases towards the inland peatlands which ranges from 6.6\u00a0m for Pulau Bruit to more than 15\u00a0m for Naman Forest Reserve. As for many of the bogs in Sarawak, their maximum thickness is not recorded at the center of the peat dome, and they are often described to have the shape of an inverted saucepan (e.g., Anderson, 1961), also called Anderson-type peatlands. The peat in Naman Forest Reserve is a typical example where the thickness at the centefTenr of the dome is 13\u00a0m, while near one of its margins, sampling with a 15-m-long auger did not reach the substrate (Anderson, 1964) and locally exceeds 20\u00a0m thickness (Scott, 1985). The formation of the basal peat is strongly controlled by the mineralogical constituents of the substrate. More specifically, the mixed layer and expandable clays in the underlying sediments limit water flow and favour the formation of peat (Staub and Gastaldo, 2003). The peat thickness is up to 10\u00a0m and the basal layer is a degraded sapric peat with high ash yield (>10%) and sulfur contents typical of a marine-influenced depositional setting (Staub and Gastaldo, 2003). The upper layers are hemic peat with relatively low ash (< 2%) capped by a thin sapric peat layer, but with lower ash than the basal one, both related to a freshwater-influenced environment (Cecil et al., 1985; Esterle et al., 1989; Cecil, 1990; Staub and Esterle, 1994; Staub and Gastaldo, 2003). The peat accumulation initiated approximately 7300\u00a0years BP in the inland areas, whereas near the shoreline the age of the peat is generally 2000\u00a0years BP or younger (Staub and Esterle, 1994; Staub and Gastaldo, 2003). The Rajang peatland is another typical area in Borneo where Shorea albida is dominant (Anderson, 1983). About 50% of the area has been drained and converted to oil palm plantations (Gaveau et al., 2016; Miettinen et al., 2016). Consequently, this drained peatland became an important source for the considerable amounts of dissolved CO2 in the Rajang River, which is oversaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere and shows higher partial pressure of CO2 relative to other Southeast Asian non-peat-draining rivers. However, it is likely that the proximity of the peatland to the coast counteracts the effect of CO2 release and the CO2 emission of the Rajang River is relatively low among other peat-draining rivers in the Southeast Asia region (M\u00fcller-Dum et al., 2019). The pH value and the carbon content of the peat are not provided.\n\n\n4.2.1.5\nPlaie Peat Forest\nThe Plaie peatland has mainly ombrogenous features occurring between Sungai Tuang and Batang Samarahan, west Sarawak, Malaysia (no. 9 in Fig. 1). Quaternary sediments consisting mainly of clay, fine sand and silt of floodplain and estuarine\/deltaic origin underlie an up to 2\u00a0m thick peat layer (Zulkifley et al., 2015, 2016). The region is also characterised in the studies by hills arising in the floodplain and is covered by a combination of Shorea albida, ferns and other shrubs. Topogenous peat occurs at the peripheral areas of the ombrogenous peat dome, although the central part of the bog is not cored to precisely define the bog substrate and hence the peatland evolution. This peat has moderate to high ash yield (15\u201340%, on a dry basis), showing characteristics of estuarine\/deltaic deposits progressively evolving to floodplain deposits (Zulkifley et al., 2013). The author also studied the peat-petrography showing the dominance of yellow unaltered plant cells, red and grey textinite, texto-ulminite, eu-ulminite, and detrohuminite.\n\n\n4.2.1.6\nMaludam\nThe Maludam peninsula ombrogenous peatland is in Betong, Sarawak lying on an alluvial substrate (no. 10 in Fig. 1). It is a large bog covering 67,400\u00a0ha, with a thickness which rarely reaches 1\u00a0m (White et al., 1956, 1957b). The dominant plant species are Shorea albida and Tristania mainqayi (Anderson, 1961, 1963). Physical characteristics of peat are not reported.\n\n\n4.2.1.7\nSadong\nIn the vicinity of Sadong River, Sarawak, an ombrogenous peatland on an alluvial substrate is reported (no. 11 in Fig. 1). The dominant plant species is Shorea albida (Anderson, 1963). The thickness, pH value, ash yield and the carbon content of peat are not reported.\n\n\n4.2.1.8\nSetapok Forest Reserve\nSetapok Forest Reserve is an ombrogenous peatland situated near Batu Kawah New Township in Kuching, Sarawak (no. 12 in Fig. 1); it overlies an alluvial substrate and has Neesia malayana and Shorea albida as the dominant plant species (Anderson, 1963). There is no reported data on the physical characteristics of peat.\n\n\n4.2.1.9\nLundu Heath Forest\nLundu includes an oligrotrophic (ombrogenous) peatland in northwest Kuching, Sarawak (no. 13 in Fig. 1). The substrate is of alluvial origin. The dominant plant species are Shorea albida and Shorea inaequilateralis (Anderson, 1963). The physical characteristics of peat are not reported.\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nPeninsular Malaysia\n\n4.2.2.1\nJohor\nThere are 289,500\u00a0ha of peatland area in the State of Johor, linked to Singapore. It is reported that 49% of the peatland has been converted to agricultural land (Abdul Jamil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nNegeri Sembilan\nNegeri Sembilan (no. 31 in Fig. 1) is located adjacent to Melaka and Johor, having 6300\u00a0ha of peatlands in which 79% has been converted to agricultural areas (Abdul Jamil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.2.2.3\nPahang\n\nAbdul Jamil et al. (1993) reported 6% of the 282,500\u00a0ha of peatlands in the State of Pahang, peninsular Malaysia, has been converted to agricultural land (no. 35 in Fig. 1).\n\n\n4.2.2.4\nPerak\nThis is an area of 107,500\u00a0ha of peatlands in the state of Perak, northwest peninsular Malaysia (no. 33 in Fig. 1), 65% of which have been converted to agricultural land (Abdul Jamil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.2.2.5\nTerengganu\nLocated in the western region of peninsular Malaysia, it hosts 88,000\u00a0ha of peatlands (no. 36 in Fig. 1), 16% of which have been converted to agricultural land (Abdul Jamil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.2.2.6\nKelantan\nPeatlands in Kelantan, peninsular Malaysia (no. 37 in Fig. 1), occupy an area of 7400\u00a0ha; 28% of the area of the peatlands has been converted to agricultural land (Abdul Jamil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.2.2.7\nPekan Nanas\nThis oligotrophic peatland is in Johor, at the southern part of peninsular Malaysia (no. 29 in Fig. 1). A sequence of sand and clay layers underlay the peat in this area (Haseldonckx, 1977). The author recorded a thickness ranging up to 12\u00a0m due to the rise-and-fall topography of the formations. The same study recorded the age of the Pekan Nanas peat to be 4896\u00a0years BP, with palms and mangroves being the dominant plant species. The peat is generally described as acidic, without more precise information.\n\n\n\n4.2.2.8\nNorth Selangor\nThis ombrogenous peatland is found in the northern part of Selangor (no. 32 in Fig. 1), west coast of peninsular Malaysia (Tonks et al., 2017). The thickness of the peat is approximately 5\u00a0m while plant species comprise those typically found in secondary, mixed swamp-forest, such as Macaranga pruinosa, Campnosperma coriaceum, Blumeodendron tokbrai, Shorea platycarpa (trees), Cyperus rotundus (sedges), Stenoclaena palustris and Asplenium longissimum (ferns), Crytotachys sp. (palms), and Pandanus atrocarpus (Yule and Gomez, 2009). The pH value of this peat ranges from 2.6 to 3.8 and decreases with increasing depth (Yule and Gomez, 2009). However, the basal lithologies, ash yield and carbon content are not known.\n\n\n4.2.2.9\nTasik Bera Basin\nThe Tasik (or Tasek) Bera Basin hosts a topogenous (soligenous) peatland, covering an area of 60\u00a0km2 in Pahang, central part of peninsular Malaysia (no. 34 in Fig. 1). The substrate consists of kaolinite-rich clay, quartz sand, and silt of lacustrine\/fluvial origin (Phillips and Bustin, 1998; Leman et al., 2000; Sone et al., 2000; W\u00fcst et al., 2002; W\u00fcst and Bustin, 1999, 2004). The peat thickness ranges from 0.5 up to 3.5\u00a0m. Deposition of organic sediments started 20,500\u00a0years BP, during the Last Glacial Maximum and extensive peat formation initiated 5300\u00a0years BP. The basin is typically covered with Pandanus helicopus, and Lepironia articulata sedges. The pH value of peat ranges from 3.3 to 5.5 (W\u00fcst et al., 2003; W\u00fcst and Bustin, 2004). The peat and the organic-rich mud show large variations of ash yield (up to 50% for peat, although some \u2018peat\u2019 samples are reported with higher ash yield, and up to 98% for mud, on a dry basis). The carbon content ranges from 0.27 to 53.6% (W\u00fcst and Bustin, 1999; W\u00fcst et al., 2002, 2003).\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nSabah\nPeatlands in Sabah are scarcely reported in the literature and a previous review of them reports a total area of 8,600,000\u00a0ha (Ambak and Chye, 1996). They commonly occur near the coastline or associated with river systems. Paramanathan et al. (1984) proposed a classification of the Sabah peatlands into four families: Klias, Kaintano, Arang and Mengalum. Forest Reserves (FR) in Sabah occurring near peatlands include the: Klias FR, Binsulok FR, Padas Damit FR and Kinabatangan-Segama Wetlands. The first three probably represent the Klias family. For Kaintano and Arang families two forest reserves were found in the relevant localities: the Hutan Simpan Trus Madi near Sungai Kaintano Besar and the Menumbok FR near Arang.\n\n4.2.3.1\nKlias Forest Reserve\nThe Klias Forest Reserve (no. 2 in Fig. 1) extends over 3630\u00a0ha (Bernard et al., 2019) and approximately 10% of this area was destroyed by severe fires in 1998 that affected several Forest Reserves in Sabah (Phua et al., 2007). The main plant species is Dryobalanops rappa, a type of canopy tree with subordinate Dactylocladus stenostachys, Madhuca motleyana, and Shorea platycarpa (Fox, 1972).\n\n\n4.2.3.2\nBinsulok Forest Reserve\nThe Binsulok Forest Reserve (no. 1 in Fig. 1) occupies an area of 12,106\u00a0ha and was almost completely destroyed by the same fire which affected the Klias FR (Phua et al., 2007). Thus, the plants covering the peatland are nearly entirely secondary plants, including the ones planted by the Peat-swamp Forest Project (Bernard et al., 2019 and references therein), using indigenous trees (Dryobalanops rappa, Gonystylus bancanus, and Lepisanther spp.).\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nIndonesia\n\n4.3.1\nLake Sentarum\nThis peatland is located in the region of Kapuas River source near Lake Sentarum National Park in west Kalimantan (no. 16 in Fig. 1). It is an ombrogenous peatland, typically found away from the lake. The peat substrate consists of limnotelmatic sandy clay derived from marine sediments and granite. The thickness of the peat is up to 1.5\u00a0m (Anshari et al., 2004). The area is predominantly surrounded by Dipterocarp Forest. At the margins of the lake, an approximately 1.50\u00a0m thick peatland (reported as Lake Pemerak) was reported by Anshari et al. (2001), as well. The carbon dates from two cores indicate ages ranging between 265 and 32,800\u00a0years BP with a considerable hiatus of approximately 10,000\u00a0years between 3117 and 13,070 BP. The dominant plant species are Arecaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Guttiferae, Lauraceae, Melastomataceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Rubiaceae (Anshari et al., 2001). However, much of the information such as the pH value, ash yield and carbon content were not recorded in the existing studies.\n\n\n4.3.2\nTeluk Keramat\nThis ombrogenous peatland (no. 14 in Fig. 1) occurs in the West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, covering an area of approximately 175\u00a0km2 (Soedjono et al., 1988). The peat substrate is siliciclastic material with dominant quartz and lesser aluminosilicate minerals; the peat reaches a maximum thickness of 10\u00a0m (Neuzil et al., 1993). The radiometric 14C dates suggest peat initiation around 4040\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0170\u00a0years BP (Neuzil, 1997). This peat generally shows a wide range in its pH (3.0\u20136.0) and ash yield (0.37\u201319.87%, on a dry basis) values, generally increasing from the upper levels of the peat dome towards the base (Neuzil et al., 1993 and references therein).\n\n\n4.3.3\nPontianak Rasau Jaya\nThis ombrogenous peatland is found in Rasau, Pontianak, in the west coast of Kalimantan, Indonesia (no. 15 in Fig. 1). The thickness of the peat reaches 2.5\u00a0m and its age at that depth is 2780\u00a0\u00b1\u00a080\u00a0years BP (Notohadiprawiro, 1981). It is one of the least studied peatlands as no other geological information is available up to date.\n\n\n4.3.4\nSebangau\nThe Sebangau peatland at south Kalimantan, Indonesia (no. 17 in Fig. 1), is underlain by an intensely weathered, up to 5\u00a0m thick, white quartz podzol and local freshwater mud (Morley, 1981; Sieffermann, 1990). The thickness of the peat may reach up to 13\u00a0m but it averages at 4.4\u00a0m (Page et al., 1999, 2002). In places, it comprises a pristine peatland and a sizable portion of it lies at the perimeter of the area affected by the past Mega Rice Project (Page et al., 1999, 2002, 2004; Muhamad and Rieley, 2002). It is an ombrogenous peatland, which is thought to have been deposited on a limnotelmatic mud (verified from detailed palynological studies, e.g.,\nMorley, 1981) and its deposition initiated 26,000\u00a0years BP. Radiometric 14C dating shows an age from 22,620\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0310\u00a0years BP (Page et al., 2004). Peat accumulation was rapid only during the Holocene (Page et al., 1999; Dommain et al., 2011). The undisturbed areas of the peatland include plant species such as Palaquium gutta, Syzygium densinervium, Xanthophyllum palembanicum, Hydnocarpus sp., Shorea guiso, Combretocarpus rotundatus, and ferns (Simbolon and Mirmanto, 2000). The Sebangau peatland accommodates a rich variety of fauna; however, intense logging activities for commercial and cultivation purposes in the area have adversely affected faunal populations, thus endangering native biodiversity (Husson et al., 2002, 2018; Mirmanto, 2010; Shepherd et al., 1997). This peatland was also subjected to prolonged drought in the years 1997\u20131998, lasting for 298\u00a0days (Taufik et al., 2019). The peat acidity is rather strong with pH values ranging from 2.3 to 3.5 (Page et al., 1999). Radiocarbon dating of charcoal horizons revealed the fire history of the peatland with variable severity during Holocene (Yulianto et al., 2004). The recorded ash yield of the profile is very low, ranging from 1.04% to 5.18%, whereas organic mud dominates the basal layers with ash yield up to 86.2% (on a dry basis). The carbon content is moderate (50.1\u201362%, on a dry basis; Page et al., 2004).\n\n\n4.3.5\nPulau Petak\nThis ombrogenous peatland is located along the Barito River in South Kalimantan, Indonesia (no. 18 in Fig. 1), and is underlain by sand, gravel and mud. Its peat thickness is up to 1.6\u00a0m (Supiandi, 1988). The surface is covered by Melaleuca leucadendron, Nipa sp., Avicennia sp., Rhizophora sp., rice fields and coconut plantations (Supiandi, 1988). The peat is acidic with an average pH value of 4.0 (Supiandi, 1988) but the age, ash yield and carbon content are still unknown.\n\n\n4.3.6\nBarambai\nThis topogenous peatland is located nearby Barito River and Banjarmasin, south Kalimantan (no. 19 in Fig. 1), on a substrate influenced by deltaic estuarine and riverbank flooding. The reported thickness is 1\u00a0m and its age is 2350\u00a0years BP (Notohadiprawiro, 1981). Other physical peat characteristics are not mentioned.\n\n\n4.3.7\nMawas\nThe Mawas peatland is located between Kapuas and Barito Rivers, in the Kapuas and Barito Selatan Districts, central Kalimantan (no. 20 in Fig. 1). It is an approximately 8\u00a0m thick formation in a largely degraded area, because it was unsuccessfully drained for the Mega Rice Project leaving behind an extensive canal network. Construction of canals due to illegal logging further drained the area, resulting in lowering of the water table, drying peat, and hence frequent wildfires (Kool et al., 2006; Sinclair et al., 2019). Due to the low water table, small domes developed near to the canals (Sinclair et al., 2019). The peat shows generally acidic pH values (3.69\u20134.67; Sinclair et al., 2019). The area includes few domes with low ash yields (< 1%, on a dry basis), some of which are collapsed and compacted and subsequently oxidised (Kool et al., 2006). The domes consist of moderately decaying peat (hemic), which has accumulated under ombrotrophic conditions.\n\n\n4.3.8\nKutai\nLocated in a remote area of east Kalimantan, and adjacent to the Mahakam River, the Kutai peatland (no. 21 in Fig. 1) was investigated systematically by Hope et al. (2005), after a preliminary study by Diemont and Pons (1992). It lies in an inland basin bounded by a range of sandstone hills, being controlled by a system of transecting rivers and a few lakes. The organic sediments include variable layers of sapric, fibrous and hemic peat, being interlayered with clays and sands. These strata are underlain by humic clay and clay. The silicate minerals in the peat consist of kaolinite, micas, chlorite, smectite and quartz. This peatland exhibits ombrogenous and topogenous features and some floodplains are partly covered from lacustrine clayey or peaty clay deposits (Diemont and Pons, 1992; Hope et al., 2005). Peat reaches a thickness of 16\u00a0m, with an average of 8\u00a0m. Radiometric 14C dates range from 840\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0260 to 7500\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0220\u00a0years BP but the peat started accumulating around 8000\u00a0years BP after the shallow flooding of the basin by the Mahakam River (Hope et al., 2005) with the greatest lateral expansion likely occurring between 7000 and 5000\u00a0years BP (Dommain et al., 2014). The most rapid accumulation of peat occurred in the limnotelmatic regime, whereas low peat accumulation rates are reported for the fluviatile regime. The initial plant cover was dominated by Pandanus sp., whereas later a dipterocarp mire-forest developed. The plant species comprise Shorea balangeran (Dipterocarpaceae), Anisopteraceae and Myrtaceae species. Generally, the pH value of the main peatland ranges from 4.0 to 5.5, whereas the clay-rich layers show pH values between 5.0 and 6.0 and the underlying peaty clay 6.0\u20136.5 (with rare exceptions up to 8; Hope et al., 2005). Peatland losses from fires were more common the last 1500\u00a0years but major fires, which burned substantial amounts of peat, were triggered during El Ni\u00f1o years. The surrounding water catchment floods up to 3\u00a0m above the mire surface, during the rainy season, but water levels fall even 6\u00a0m down during the dry seasons; thus, it has been experiencing recurrent peat fires during the last few decades. However, the Kutai peatland is still an important carbon sink as carbon losses from the Holocene fires never exceeded the relevant carbon storage (Dommain et al., 2014).\n\n\n4.3.9\nIrian Jaya\nOn the Island of New Guinea, an estimated area of 2.4 Mha is occupied by peatlands. Irian Jaya (no. 22 in Fig. 1) shows a peat thickness which generally increases with increasing altitude ranging from 0.8 to 8.5\u00a0m (Hope, 2007). The accumulation of peat started 22,000 to 12,000\u00a0years BP. At high altitudes, the thin peat layers are formed by Carpha alpina and Ranuculus saruwagetica tundras (Wade and McVean, 1969). Phragmites karka and sedges formed peat with fibrous texture intermixed with silt or clay. Across this mire forest, Syzygium, Pandanus sp. and gymnosperm taxa are also common (Haberle, 1995).\n\n\n4.3.10\nBatang Hari \u2013 Berbak River\nLocated along the Batang Hari River at the coastal plains of Jambi Province, Sumatra Island (no. 23 in Fig. 1), this ombrogenous peat overlies sandstone, siltstone, volcaniclastics, and organic sediments (Cameron et al., 1989, 1990). Pleistocene terraces underlie the deeper peat layers in the area and a mangrove ecosystem dominates the upper peat layers (Supiandi, 1988; Cameron et al., 1989, 1990). The peat thickness usually ranges from 1 to 7\u00a0m (Cameron, 1987; Cameron et al., 1989, 1990; Fujimoto et al., 2019), with a maximum reported depth of 10\u00a0m (Silvius et al., 1984). The ages were recorded from thick and thin peat layers, ranging between 6800 and 5700 and 4250\u20131200\u00a0years BP (Supiandi, 1988; Fujimoto et al., 2019). The areas are dominated by dense peat forest consisting of Alstonia pneumatophora, Licuala acutifida (palm), Pandanus sp. and Shorea sp. (Supiandi, 1988; Morley, 2013; Fujimoto et al., 2019). The pH value of the peat ranges widely from 3.1\u20135.4 and the ash yield from 1.90 to 25.1% (generally 15%, on dry basis, on the peat margins; Cameron et al., 1989; Fujimoto et al., 2019). The peat also contains 40 to 50% organic carbon, on dry basis (Silvius et al., 1984).\n\n\n4.3.11\nSungai Buluh\nThis peatland is found at the eastern coastline of Jambi Province, central Sumatra (no. 24 in Fig. 1). The peat is mostly hemic with some clayey interlayers in the top horizons and has a thickness of up to 2.4\u00a0m; it overlays a terrestrial grayish to brown clay (Hapsari et al., 2017; Meyers, 1994). Peat accumulation started around 13,400\u00a0years BP with radiometric 14C dating back to 11,624\u00a0\u00b1\u00a066\u00a0years BP. This profile also experienced a transitional period from topogenous to ombrogenous conditions at depth of around 1.7\u00a0m dating back to around 2500\u00a0years BP. The common plant species found include Macaranga, Myrtaceae, Nauclea, Pometia and Antidesma (Hapsari et al., 2017).\n\n\n4.3.12\nAir Hitam\nThe peatland of Air Hitam Laut River (translated as the Black Water River) is located in the east of the island of Sumatra in the Jambi Province (no. 25 in Fig. 1), along the riverbanks within Berbak National Park (Van Eijk et al., 2009; W\u00f6sten et al., 2006a). Organic material and large volumes of humic and fulvic acids washed out from the peat result in the distinctive black colour of the river water (Giesen, 2004). The peat thickness averages at around 4\u00a0m, with a highest reported thickness up to 15\u00a0m (Giesen et al., 2016; Wahyunto et al., 2003). The buildup started on Pleistocene terraces (W\u00f6sten et al., 2006a) around 7770\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0101\u00a0years BP and was originally under minerotrophic conditions, which subsequently changed to ombrotrophic ones at around 4500\u00a0years BP (Biagioni et al., 2015). A detailed description of the important biodiversity (both flora and fauna) thriving in Air Hitam is provided by Giesen et al. (2016) who mention that the flora is dominated by riparian vegetation replaced mainly by Nypa fruticans, Pandanus helicopus and Hanguana malayana along the river and further inland. The pH value of the water and the peat itself ranges between 3.5 and 3.9 (Andriesse, 1988). The boundary of the peat domes often floods resulting in higher nutrient contents compared to its central parts (Anderson, 1961). A drought event lasting 314\u00a0days in 2015 has further escalated wildfires in this peatland (Taufik et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.3.13\nSiak Kanan\nSiak Kanan peatland is an ombrogenous peatland adjacent to the Siak Kanan River in the Central Sumatran Basin (no. 26 in Fig. 1). Metaquartzite, granite and tuff constitute the basement for the central Sumatra Basin overlain by sedimentary rocks such as mudstone and siltstone (Supardi et al., 1993). The latter sediments, with dominant occurrence of quartz and minor kaolinite, constitute the peat substrate (Neuzil et al., 1993). The thickness of Siak Kanan peatland averages 4\u00a0m, and up to 9\u00a0m at the centre, reaching 13\u00a0m in some areas (Neuzil et al., 1993; Fujimoto et al., 2019). The age of the Siak Kanan peat is around 5220\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0220\u00a0years BP (Neuzil, 1997). Peat began to accumulate rapidly between 6000 and 5000\u00a0years BP (Fujimoto et al., 2019). Rhizophora sp. community has a major contribution to the formation of the peat from its basal layers indicating that mangrove forests were dominant throughout the evolution of this peatland (Fujimoto et al., 2019). The pH value of the peat ranges from 3.0 to 4.0 for the upper parts of the peatland and from 4.0 to 6.0 near the base and the mineral substrate (Neuzil et al., 1993; Supardi et al., 1993). The peat mainly displays fibric to hemic texture, with minor contribution of sapric layers. The basal peat exhibits a high humification degree and sulfur content (Neuzil et al., 1993; Supardi et al., 1993). The ash yield varies vastly between the upper levels of the peat in comparison to its basal layers with values ranging from 0.13 to 16.86%, respectively (Neuzil et al., 1993).\n\n\n4.3.14\nBengkalis\nThis peatland occupies 76.05% of the area of Bengkalis Island (no. 27 in Fig. 1) proximally situated to Siak Kanan peatland (Syahza et al., 2019). The Bengkalis peatland is ombrogenous and shows similar peat quality to Siak Kanan, although the latter is thicker and larger (Neuzil et al., 1993; Supardi et al., 1993). The Bengkalis peat substrate is similar to that of Siak Kanan, composed of silty and clayey sediments (Neuzil et al., 1993). The thickness of the peat around Bengkalis averages 5\u00a0m but its maximum thickness is up to 9\u00a0m (Supardi et al., 1993; Vernimmen et al., 2017; Ill\u00e9s et al., 2019). The age of Bengkalis peatland is around 5500\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0220\u00a0years BP (Neuzil, 1997). The forest has been mostly converted to plantations such as sago, coconut and oil palm, resulting in a gradual decline of the local biodiversity (Syahza et al., 2019). The basal peat layers display higher humification degree and higher pH level (5.0 to 6.5) than its surface (Neuzil et al., 1993; Supardi et al., 1993). The reported ash values (0.29\u201317.11%) show a similar range to the Siak Kanan ones, as well as a similar decreasing trend from bottom to the upper part (Neuzil et al., 1993).\n\n\n\n4.4\nSingapore\n\n4.4.1\nNee Soon\nSingapore has a minute community of peatland areas, but a distinct peatland area is found in the topogenous freshwater mire forest (no. 28 in Fig. 1) of Nee Soon (Taylor et al., 2001). Much of the peat is overlain or underlain by fine- to coarse-grained sand deriving from the weathering of a Triassic granite (Public Works Department, 1976). The radiocarbon dating recorded an age of 23,050\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0330\u00a0years BP (Taylor et al., 2001). Pometia pinnata, Palaquium xanthochymun (Sapotaceae), Mangifera griffithii and Strombosia ceylanica (Myrtaceae) are the dominant tree species in the area (Turner et al., 1996). Canopy-forming species are also present including Anacardaceae, Magnoliaceae, Rubiaceae, Leguminosae, Sapindaceae and Dipterocarpaceae species (Taylor et al., 2001).\n\n\n\n4.5\nMyanmar\n\n4.5.1\nThanintharyi\nThanintharyi region is adjacent to Thailand at south Myanmar (no. 40 in Fig. 1). While there are 158 locations of potential peatlands across Myanmar, the largest identified peatlands occur in Thanintharyi and Ayeyarwady regions, as well as in the Shan State. This was proven from the organic-rich soil located close to the Bacourea sapida forest in the region. The thickness of the Thanintharyi peatland reaches 2.7\u00a0m (Aseanpeat, 2014).\n\n\n4.5.2\nAyeyarwady\nThis region is located within the delta of the Ayeyarwady River (no. 41 in Fig. 1). Indications of mires are based on the high organic matter content exceeding 53% in the recorded \u2018soil\u2019 lithologies. However, this area is still under assessment and is only indicated as a potential peatland area (Aseanpeat, 2014).\n\n\n4.5.3\nShan State\nShan State covers an area of about 15.58 Mha, bordering China, Laos and Thailand. Two large peatlands have been identified in Heho Valley and the Inle Lake covering an area of 1625.7 and 9105.94\u00a0ha, respectively (no. 42 in Fig. 1). Seventy-seven locations have been logged with the reported peat thicknesses ranging from 0.3 to 3.3\u00a0m (Aseanpeat, 2014).\n\n\n\n4.6\nThailand\n\n4.6.1\nPru Toh Daeng, Narathiwat Province\nThailand includes an area of approximately 63,800\u00a0ha of peatlands (Table 1). After the year 2000 there have been significant land use changes with oil palm plantations and built-up areas to have increased by 6.80 and 2.87%, respectively, at the expense of evergreen forest, thus causing a calculated carbon stock change of about 4 Gt (Srisunthon and Chawchai, 2020). The largest peatland province is Narathiwat (45,300\u00a0ha), part of which is Pru Toh Daeng (no. 38 in Fig. 1), the most important ombrogenous peatland in the area (34,700\u00a0ha). The peat thickness reaches 10\u00a0m towards the center of the dome, overlaying a pyrite-bearing, marine clay formation. The pH value gradually becomes alkaline downwards from a value of 4 near the surface to a value of around 7\u20138 at the basal layer. The forests are structured into four \u201cstoreys\u201d (i.e., interdependent layers of flora with different levels of water, sunlight, and air circulation, typically found in rainforests) of over 109 families and 437 plant species, of which Ganua motleyana, Macarangua prunoisa with some palm and sedges species being the common (Niyomdham et al., 1996).\n\n\n4.6.2\nNakhon Si-Thammarat\nThis tropical peatland is found in Southern Thailand, about 610\u00a0km south of Bangkok (no. 39 in Fig. 1). This area was drained for agricultural use, mainly palm oil plantation. Woody peat alternates clay layers up to a depth of about 1.3\u00a0m. Palm plantation dominates most of the surrounding areas (Iiyama and Osawa, 2010).\n\n\n4.6.3\nNong Han Kumphawapi\nThis 5600-ha-large peatland is initiated on a broad lacustrine and alluvial plain at the southeast part of Sakon Nakhon Basin, with a distinctive 10\u201315\u00a0m salt-mound island at the centre of the basin (no. 46 in Fig. 1). This salt heap is thought to be the result of dissolution and re-deposition of evaporites beneath and adjacent to the lake (Wohlfarth et al., 2012). It is possible that the basin itself formed due to the collapse of cavities, which are formed after the dissolution of evaporites, beneath the bottom of the lake. Peat has a variable thickness from 25 up to 90\u00a0cm and either it is covered by alternations of organic mud with variable small amounts of clay or it is exposed to the surface (Penny et al., 1996; Penny, 1998; Wohlfarth et al., 2012). The plant species around the basin are these thriving in open woodlands and dry\/mixed deciduous forests, on a basement comprising clay, silty clay and sandy clay, occurring at depths from 1.50 to over 5\u00a0m. Radiometric 14C ages of over 10,500\u00a0years BP, followed upwards by limnic organic mud clays are reported (Kealhofer and Penny, 1998; Penny, 1998). Dating of these organic sediments indicates their deposition in well-mixed and oxygenated waters until 6700\u00a0years BP. In the 6.700\u20135900\u00a0years BP time span, the lake began to produce organic matter reaching its maximum production at 5400\u00a0years BP. The subsequent accumulation hiatus suggests an extensive dry period. The peat accumulation reinitiated approximately between 4000 and 3200\u00a0years BP, with periodic dry seasons, followed by the establishment of a wetland (muddy clay) with the rising of the groundwater level at an average accumulation rate of less than 0.4\u00a0mm\/year. The later organic sediments demonstrate two hiatuses at 2700\u20132500\u00a0years and 1900\u20131600\u00a0years BP, which are interpreted as the results of dryness. A new shallow lake was formed at approximately 1600\u00a0years BP (Wohlfarth et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n4.7\nCambodia\n\n4.7.1\nMekong River\nIt occurs in the lowland area of Mekong River close to Phnom Penh (no. 43 in Fig. 1). Drill cores show a 5\u00a0m thick alternation of peat with graded sand and silt at a depth of around 7\u00a0m overlying horizons of mud and clay (Tamura et al., 2007). Abundant charcoal fragments were also present in the peaty layers. 14C dating shows ages between 7207\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046 to 7976\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027\u00a0years BP in an intertidal to supratidal, salt, marsh environment. This peatland overlies rhythmic alternations of tidal mud and sand, which in turn overlie fluvial deposits older than approximately 9200\u00a0years BP (Tamura et al., 2007).\n\n\n4.7.2\nBotum Sakor\nLocated in Koh Kong Province (no. 44 in Fig. 1), this ombrogenous peatland was quite recently discovered growing within mangrove boundaries near the Chhak Kompong Sam River (Lo et al., 2018). The peat thickness increases with distance from the river, varying from 0.2 to 1.35\u00a0m (Lo et al., 2018). Since the peat is growing in a mangrove community, it has a fibrous texture and is underlain by sand and clay sediments. There are several main tree species documented by Lo et al. (2018), which include Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera sexangula, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Xylocarpus granatum.\n\n\n\n4.7.3\nPeam Krasop\nPeam Krasop is an ombrogenous peatland in southwestern Cambodia (no. 45 in Fig. 1) with a total area of 4976\u00a0ha with thickness ranging between 0.44 and 2.0\u00a0m (Lo et al., 2014, 2016). The carbon content of peat ranges from 19.6 to 22.9% (Porchhay et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n4.8\nThe Philippines\n\n4.8.1\nCagayan\nThe Cagayan peatland in the northeastern part of Luzon, extends to an area of about 2000\u00a0ha having a maximum thickness of 0.3\u00a0m (no. 49 in Fig. 1). Some areas with thin peat layers are used mainly for rice cultivation and other products. The pH value ranges between 4.0 and 5.8 and the ash yield is low to moderately high (27.4\u201366.3%, on a dry basis; Klemetti et al., 1996) indicating that some samples have been misinterpreted as peat instead of carbonaceous sediments or organic muds (with ash yield >50%).\n\n\n4.8.2\nBasey, Samar\nThis 300-ha large peatland is located in Basey, the eastern part of the Philippines Archipelago (no. 50 in Fig. 1). The shallow peat layer can be found at a depth between 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0m beneath the current surface. The pH value ranges between 5.4 and 6.1, while the peat has moderate ash yield (16.5\u201348.8%, on a dry basis; Klemetti et al., 1996).\n\n\n4.8.3\nLeyte\nLocated adjacent to Samar Province, this 3400-ha large peatland, has a thickness up to 7.0\u00a0m (no. 51 in Fig. 1). The recorded pH value spans between 5.07 and 6.80; the ash yield broadly varies between 9.1 and 64.8%, on dry basis (Klemetti et al., 1996). Again, the samples with ash yield higher than 50% (on a dry basis) are misinterpreted as peat.\n\n\n4.8.4\nAgusan del Sur\nThis region accounts for about 5000\u00a0ha approximately 30\u00a0km from the nearest coastline, close to Gibong and Agusan Rivers in Agusan del Sur Province (no. 52 in Fig. 1). The thickness of the peat ranges between 0.6 and 4.0\u00a0m (Klemetti et al., 1996). Several plant species in this area, which also occur in other mire forests across Southeast Asia, include Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae, Burseraceae, Clusiaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Leguminosae, Myristicaceae, Myrtaceae, and Rubiaceae (Aribal and Fernando, 2018; Morley, 1981; Shepherd et al., 1997). The pH value of the studied sediments varies between 4.65 and 6.63, and the ash yields are moderately high to high (66.4\u201382.1%, on a dry basis; Klemetti et al., 1996), denoting that it is not actually peat, as reported, but rather muddy sediments.\n\n\n\n4.9\nLaos\nCurrently, there are limited studies on the peatlands of Laos. While fifteen locations have been surveyed as potential peatlands (no. 47 in Fig. 1), only three of them include peat horizons: the Phapho, the Nong Phou and the Nongphangdeng sites (Aseanpeat, 2021b).\n\n\n4.10\nVietnam\nVietnam includes a vast forest covering about 12.3 Mha, hosting several unlogged mires and peatlands, whereas 24,000-ha large peatlands are located mainly in the lower Mekong Delta (no. 48 in Fig. 1). Currently, there are insufficient studies on the peatlands in Vietnam, and only peatlands in the U Minh Thuong and U Minh Ha National Parks are designated as protected areas (Aseanpeat, 2021c).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe \u201cparadox\u201d existence of tropical peatlands\nThe thriving of boreal peatlands is well explained from the limited microbial decay of the organic matter due to low temperature and the constant water saturation (Clymo, 1984; Treat et al., 2014). The persistence of peatlands in the tropics is ostensibly a paradox. Large amounts of leaf litter accumulate forming peat rather than decomposing and enriching the soil with nutrients; moreover, despite the nutrient-poor soils, a large and diverse flora is maintained and thrives (e.g.,\nAnderson, 1963; MacKinnon et al., 1997). Seemingly it is a contradiction that the constantly elevated temperatures do not accelerate microbial decomposition of organic matter as expected (e.g.,\nKnorr et al., 2005). Several interpretations have been published to explain this phenomenon. Many researchers conclude that the immense primary productivity and the fast accumulation of organic litter in tropical areas result in slower decomposition rates (e.g.,\nPetersen and Cummins, 1974; Gillman et al., 2015). The consistently high supply of plant litter throughout the year in the tropical peatlands results in constantly low (and definitely much lower than theoretically expected) soil respiration rates, as a result of the limited substrate area (Chimner, 2004). The rapidly accumulating plant litter restricts the aeration of the soil, therefore the organic matter is protected from decomposition and CO2 formation. There are also postulations that the inhibition of the microbial and fungal activity due to hostile abiotic conditions (high acidity, anoxic environment, etc.) in the peatlands is key to peat formation in the tropics (e.g., Anderson, 1983; Whitten et al., 2000). However, a combination of the following factors seems to better explain the formation of tropical peatlands: The high amount of meteoric precipitation favours and sustains the dense mire forests, as it is the main provider of nutrients (MacKinnon et al., 1997). Furthermore, the intrinsically high levels of lignin and toxins in the leaves of many endemic plants in the peatland forests (e.g., Pahang Forestry Department, 2005; Lim et al., 2014) inhibit microbial decay (Yule and Gomez, 2009). Tropical peatlands incorporate mostly coarse and woody organic matter unlike boreal peatlands, which often include a high portion of soft plants. This coarse, woody material has a low surface area and derives from plants which contribute chemically resistant compounds, like lignin and aromatics, to the peat (Chimner, 2004; Gandois et al., 2013, 2014; Hodgkins et al., 2018). In addition, higher degrees of humification in the warm climatic zones selectively remove labile carbohydrates and hence the peat remains enriched in recalcitrant compounds (Hodgkins et al., 2018).\n\n\n5.2\nCharacteristics of the Southeast Asian peatlands\nThe available data comprises a selected set of 52 peatlands from the region of Southeast Asia (Figs. 1 and 2\n). Generally, areas of high interest, which require in-depth research for certain practices (e.g., Mega Rice Project, cultivation, land conversion for settlement, and plantation) have adequate information on the peat properties. In contrast, studies from peatlands that have received less attention provide fewer details. Obviously, there are more peatlands in the region; however, the current review focuses only on those sites for which there is at least few geological data. Papers which include exclusively biological details are not considered. Geological data from the Southeast Asian peatlands are inadequate and non-comparable (because a large number of studies have different and frequently inconsistent focuses and include different data), as most attention has been paid to biodiversity research, and not the comprehensive study of the geological parameters that affect peat accumulation and\/or peatification.\nThe reported parameters values from the reviewed Southeast Asian peatlands are listed in Table A3 (in supplementary appendix) whereas a summary of the data availability in the reviewed peatlands, in each region, is given in Table A4 (in supplementary appendix). The thickness and the type of peatlands are recorded in most of the studies (in 65.4 and 61.5% of the reviewed areas, respectively; Fig. 3A). Radiocarbon ages (in 40.4% of the reviewed sites), pH (in 32.7% of the reviewed sites), ash yield (in 32.7% of the reviewed sites) and carbon contents (in 15.4% of the reviewed sites) are poorly reported (Figs. 2 and 3B, C). Finally, the lithological characteristics and the origin of the substrate are described in 48.1 and 46.2%, respectively of the reviewed peatlands.\n\n5.2.1\nSubstrate formations\nThe formations underlying the peatlands reflect the environment of their initial accumulation and are reported in 48.1% of the reviewed sites (Fig. 2, 4A and Tables A3, A4 in supplementary appendix). The lithology of the substrates in Malay and Indochina peninsulas, the Philippines and New Guinea are generally underreported (Fig. 4A). Mixed environments (fluvial, alluvial and lacustrine with or without marine facies) are reported mainly from central and north Borneo and Sumatra. In most of the studies for Borneo, the basement formations consist of varieties of sand and clay. At Sumatra Island, both the Siak Kanan and Bengkalis peatlands are underlain by metaquarzite, granite and tuff along with kaolinite. Sandstone, siltstone and volcaniclastics can also be found underlying the Batang Hari-Berbak deltaic peat, and clay in the peat of Sungai Buluh. At peninsular Malaysia, the reported peatlands in Tasik Bera Basin, North Selangor, and Pekan Nanas are underlain by clay rich in kaolinite, silt and sand. In Singapore, Nee Soon peat is underlain by coarse-grained sand which may originate from the Triassic granite of Bukit Timah while peatlands in Thailand are underlain mostly by sand and clay, containing pyrite at sites, silt, evaporites and organic mud (reported as gyttja). Finally, sand, silt and clay are found at the bottom of Botum Sakor and Mekong River peatland in Cambodia.\n\n\n5.2.2\nPeatland type\nThe peatland type was reported in approximately 62% of the reviewed areas while peatlands in the regions of the Indochina peninsula and the Philippines generally lack this information (Figs. 2 and 4B). Most of the peatlands in Borneo, Sumatra, peninsular Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia show ombrogenous characteristics and are generally formed on marine and brackish or fluvial and alluvial or a combination of these sedimentary environments. Few topogenous peatlands are developed either on fluvial (Barambai and Nee Soon) or lacustrine deposits (Tasik Bera and Pekan Nanas). Peatlands which show attested transition from topogenous to ombrogenous during their evolution occur in Plaie peat forest, Kutai and Sungai Buluh (Fig. 4B). Obviously, without complete coring and logging such transitions cannot be observed.\n\n\n5.2.3\nThe onset of peat accumulation\nThe available age dataset covers 40.4% of the reviewed areas in the Southeast Asian region. Most radiometric age data are reported from Borneo and Sumatra Islands whereas peatlands in Malay and Indochina peninsulas and the Philippines generally lack this information (Figs. 2, 4C and Tables A3, A4 in supplementary appendix). Peat accumulation in Southeast Asia started in Late Pleistocene, before LGM in central Borneo, Singapore, and New Guinea island (Figs. 4C and 5A). The Lake Sentarum peatland marks the oldest reported initiation of peat deposition, which occurred at 32,800\u00a0years BP (Anshari et al., 2004). The Sungai Buluh peatland (Sumatra) also formed in Late Pleistocene but after LGM. Nevertheless, the majority of the peatlands in Southeast Asia have been reportedly formed during Holocene, which was a globally warmer period corresponding to wetter conditions in Southeast Asia. The highest density of peatlands initiation is observed in the Fast Fluctuating and Warming periods (8400 to 6000 and 6000 to 3000\u00a0years ago, respectively; Figs. 4C and 5A). Notably, Late Holocene peatlands occur only at the north and west coastal areas of Borneo (Fig. 4C). However, it is not clear whether in all areas, the maximum peat thickness has been sampled for radiocarbon dating. Reasonably, no peat formation is reported during the LGM (a very dry period in the region). Fig. 5B illustrates that most of the Holocene peatlands have been initiated when the sea level was similar to or slightly higher than the current mean level (Tjia and Fujii, 1992). In contrast, Morris et al. (2017) recommend that the peat initiation in the tropical regions of Africa and South and Central America was triggered in waterlogged areas possibly due to tectonic subsidence. It is probable that the higher, relative to Pleistocene, sea levels, ranging between \u22121 and\u00a0+\u00a05\u00a0m from the Mean Sea Level (MSL) had a positive contribution to the formation of peat in the coastal areas of the Southeast Asia (Fig. 5B).\n\n\n5.2.4\nPeat thickness\nThe thickness is recorded in 65.4% of the reviewed peatland sites across Southeast Asia (Tables A3 and A4 in supplementary appendix). Five arbitrary intervals (binned every 4\u00a0m) are defined in this paper to group peat thicknesses in Southeast Asia. Most of the information about thicknesses comes from Sumatra and Borneo Islands, as well as New Guinea whereas studies from peninsula Malaysia, Indochina and Philippines generally lack this information (Figs. 3A and 4D). Generally, Borneo and Sumatra Island contain the thickest peatlands including Rajang in Sarawak, which has the maximum reported thickness (20\u00a0m) of peat in Southeast Asia. In contrast, peatlands in Indochina peninsula and the Philippines have thicknesses generally below 4\u00a0m (Fig. 4D). However, it cannot be precluded that some peatlands are thicker than reported and the researchers have not drilled them in sites with their maximum thicknesses.\n\n\n5.2.5\nPeat accumulation rate\nThe peat accumulation rate in each profile is calculated by dividing the radiometric age difference between two different depths by their relevant distance and therefore, these rates were calculated only from sites that include both radiocarbon ages and thicknesses. The average accumulation rates are calculated in approximately 37% of the reported peatlands and are listed in Table 2\n. These calculations do not consider variations in the temporal accumulation rates nor potential compaction within peats.\nThe fastest average peat accumulation rates are calculated in the relatively thick (8\u201316\u00a0m) peatlands, mostly occurring in the coastal areas of Borneo and Sumatra, which were initiated in Middle to Late Holocene (Fig. 4E). Notably, Ulu Mendaram in Brunei Darussalam has the highest average accumulation rate (4.30\u00a0mm\/yr) followed by Baram River (2.80\u00a0mm\/yr) in Sarawak, Siak Kanan (2.68\u00a0mm\/yr) in Sumatra, Teluk Keramat (2.48) in Sarawak and Pekan Nanas (2.45\u00a0mm\/yr) in peninsular Malaysia. However, many of the peatlands in Southeast Asia show low average accumulation rates and generally less than 2\u00a0mm\/yr. In contrast, the boreal and subarctic peatlands show accumulation rates, which hardly exceed 1\u00a0mm\/yr and frequently they are less than that (e.g., Borren et al., 2004; Primeau and Garneau, 2021) and in any case, they are much lower compared to the accumulation rates of the tropical peatlands.\nIt is noteworthy that even in the areas where peat deposition started between 10,000 and 20,000\u00a0years BP, the peak of peat accumulation only occurred between 5000 and 9000\u00a0years BP. In addition, W\u00fcst et al. (2007) provide evidence for rapid peat accumulation in Southeast Asia during the intervals 13,000 - 8000, 6000\u20133000 and the last 1000\u00a0years BP.\n\n\n5.2.6\nSurface vegetation\nA comprehensive review of the history and evolution of tropical rain forests in a global context is provided by Morley (2000). Information about flora is the most abundant in the reviewed papers for the Southeast Asian peatlands, as all of them contain some information either about the present species or\/and any other relevant information. The dipterocarp tree species, especially Shorea albida, are reported in almost 50% of the reviewed sites in Borneo and are exclusively present in peatlands along NW Borneo. Posa et al. (2011) stated that Shorea albida is an endemic species to Borneo mainly found in Brunei, Sarawak, and NW Kalimantan. In Sumatra, four out of five sites report plant species consisting of Pandanus helicopus, Pandanus sp., Shorea sp., Nypa fruticans, Macaranga, Myrtaceae, Nauclea, Pometia, Antidesma, Hanguana malayana, Alstonia pneumatophora, Rhizophora sp. and Licuala acutifida. The plant species is reported in 30% of the reviewed sites in peninsular Malaysia, which include Pandanus helicopus, Pandanus artocarpus, Lepironia articulata sedges, Macaranga, ferns, and palms. Abdul Jamil et al. (1993) report that up to 80% of the peatland areas in peninsular Malaysia have been converted to land for agricultural activities.\nNee Soon in Singapore includes canopy-forming species such as Mangifera griffithii (Anacardaceae) and Magnolia candollii (Magnoliaceae). Plant species which thrive in the Sumatran peatlands include Alstonia pneumatophora, Licuala acutifida, Pandanus sp., Shorea sp., Macaranga, Myrtaceae, Nauclea, Pometia, Antidesma, Nypa fruticans, Pandanus helicopus, Hanguana malayana, and Rhizophora sp. The forest of Bacourea sapida dominates Thanintharyi peat region in Myanmar. Some palm and sedges species, open woodlands, and mixed deciduous forests dominate most of Thailand's peat forests. The peat of Botum Sakor is dominated by Rhizophora apiculata, with mixture of Nypa fruticans, Pandanus sp., ferns and Oncosperma palm which suggest this area is a mangrove-rich area. There are few plant species in the Philippines that also occur in other Southeast Asian regions, which belong to the families of Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae, Burseraceae, Clusiaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Leguminosae, Myristicaceae, Myrtaceae, and Rubiaceae. In Irian Jaya, the peat forest is dominated by Carpha alpina, Ranuculus saruwagetica tundras, Syzygium, Pandanus sp. and gymnosperm taxa.\n\n\n5.2.7\nPeat acidity\nInformation about pH values of the peatlands is reported in 32.7% of the sites (Tables A3 and A4 in supplementary appendix). Generally acidic to neutral (2.6\u20136.8) pH values are reported from the peatlands of the region, with the exception of Kutai peatland where a pH value of 8.0 is reported. Current data shows that Borneo and Sumatra peatlands have similar characteristics and are slightly more acidic (average pH values are 4.3 and 4.5, respectively) than peatlands in peninsular Malaysia with an average pH of 5.4 (Fig. 3B). Pru Toh Daeng in Thailand shows a pH range from 4.0 to 5.0 and peatlands in the Philippines exhibit pH from 4.0 to 6.8. Most of the peatlands in the region are ombrogenous, and Kurnain et al. (2002) stated that pH for ombrogenous peat ranges from 3.0 to 4.0. However, the relevant data is incomplete and only 25% of the reviewed sites report both pH and the peatland type. The current dataset is not enough to conclude on the range of pH values in each area or region, as it is strongly dependent on the studied part of the peatland. There are inconsistencies in various studies, such as differences in pH measurement methods and several of them focusing on a small area only of the entire peatland, while some others provide broader insights of the peat characteristics.\n\n\n5.2.8\nAsh yield\nFew studies, accounting to 32.7% of the reviewed sites, report the determination of ash yield of the peat (Tables A3 and A4 in supplementary appendix). Classifications of ash yield by International Peat Society (1981), Andrejko et al. (1983), Mankinen and Gelfer (1982) and Kearnes and Davison (1983) suggest that ash yield is less than 50% (on a dry basis) for peat, whereas ash yield values above 50% should be reserved for peaty and carbonaceous muds. Low to moderate ash yield values are determined in seven peatlands in Borneo, up to 5.7% in Ulu Mendaram, less than 2% and more than 15% in Baram, less than 2% in Rajang, up to 40% in Plaie Peat Forest, less than 1% in Mawas and 19.87% in Teluk Keramat (Fig. 3C). The ash yield of Sebangau peat is generally low ranging from 1.04 to 5.18%. In the Sumatran region, the ash yield is recorded in Batang Hari-Berbak River (up to 25.1%), in Siak Kanan (up to 16.86%) and in Bengkalis (up to 17.11%). The peatland in Tasik Bera Basin displays ash yield of 1% from the surface to 98% at the base of the profile. Ash yield of the Philippines' peatland shows a broad range from low to high values (9.1\u201382.1%, on a dry basis). High ash yield values are generally reported for the basal layer or the substrate in specific peatlands. However, the high-ash samples from the Philippines are erroneously classified as peat by the authors, as carbonaceous mud is a more suitable classification. Notably, several layers in the Southeast Asian peatlands have been misinterpreted as peat, having ash yield contents higher than 50% (based on Jarret in Andrejko et al., 1983) or even higher than 70% (based on the threshold of Joosten and Clarke, 2002), and hence researchers must be aware and warned to avoid propagating the confusion.\n\n\n5.2.9\nCarbon content\nCarbon contents in the Southeast Asian peat are variable (up to 60%) and are reported only in the 15.4% of the reviewed sites (Tables A3 and A4 in supplementary appendix). It is important to highlight that about 90% of the reviewed papers do not contain information on the carbon content thus inhibiting the extraction of regional insights on this peat feature.\nAn interesting approach by Ridgwell et al. (2003) infers that during the Late Holocene there was a rising trend in atmospheric CO2, as a result of CO2 degassing from the post-glacial formation of coral reefs and other shallow water carbonate deposits. The complexation of CO3\n2\u2212in the formation of CaCO3 shifts the equilibrium of the reaction:\n\n\n\nCO\n2\n\n+\n\nCO\n3\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\nH\n2\n\nO\n\u21cc\n2\n\nHCO\n3\n\u2212\n\n\n\nto the left (according to Le Chatelier's principle) thus increasing the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface layers of the ocean. Hence, peat accumulation in Sundaland has a significant role in the Holocene carbon pool and a substantial impact on the post-glacial atmospheric CO2 budget (Abrams et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n5.3\nClimatic effects\nSoutheast Asia has a nearly uniform warm and humid climate throughout the year, with a mean monthly temperature of 26.5\u00a0\u00b0C, a relative humidity over 60% and a mean annual rainfall between 2000 and 4000\u00a0mm (Dommain et al., 2011). There is a tendency for the mean annual temperature to increase, particularly during the dry seasons, and precipitation to decrease in the region due to global warming (Manton et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2020). The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation greatly influences the amount of rainfall in the region. The El Ni\u00f1o phase raises the temperature with the combination of hot weather and decline in meteoric precipitations thus allowing prolonged duration of droughts (Susilo et al., 2013). Studies during the El Ni\u00f1o events in Jambi Province and central Kalimantan, Indonesia, found that the groundwater table could descend up to 1.7\u00a0m beneath the current peat surface in drained peatlands (W\u00f6sten et al., 2006a, 2006b; Ballhorn et al., 2009; Page et al., 2009b; Taufik et al., 2019). These conditions would have a notable effect in the outbreak of wildfires to the already vulnerable dry peatlands across the region.\n\n\n5.4\nTopographic effects on peat accumulation\nPresumably both climatic and topographic conditions played a significant role in the development of mires in Southeast Asia (e.g.,\nCobb et al., 2017). Most of the peatlands in Southeast Asia occur in lowlands, along the coastlines. Climatic and sea level changes resulted in flooded coastal areas, which subsequently turned into palustrine wetlands. Thus, the peat is majorly accumulated on shallow marine to deltaic or lacustrine fine sediments. These conditions together with the gradual increase of topographic relief have subsequently promoted the formation of ombrotrophic mires with subordinate minerotrophic areas at their marginal, gently steeping reliefs (e.g., Rieley et al., 1996).\nExceptionally, some considerable topogenous peatlands are developed in the region: The flat flood plain of Tasik (Lake) Bera and Pahang River in peninsular Malaysia were supplied with mineral-rich waters, hence abundant nutrients, which established favourable conditions for the development of the minerotrophic Tasik Bera mire. Likewise, a deltaic estuarine and flooding of the riverbank in Barambai play an important role in the evolution of the topogenous peatland of the area. Finally, the topogenous Nee Soon peatland receives nutrients from local rainfall and surface drainage (Taylor et al., 2001).\n\n\n5.5\nChronological framework of the Southeast Asian peatlands\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Pleistocene (ca. 26,500 to 16,000\u00a0years BP and culminated at around 21,000\u00a0years BP) the sea level reached approximately 120\u00a0m below MSL and hence a vast area of the Sunda shelf, consisting of broad mangrove forests, was exposed (Verstappen, 1975; Bird et al., 2005; Abrams et al., 2018). Those conditions of lower sea level and water temperature were accompanied by the northward deviation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone leading to fewer rainfalls (Verstappen, 1975; Kienast et al., 2001). The temperature in the tropical region of Southeast Asia during the LGM was not as low as in the boreal zones, however it eventually resulted in dry lowlands and retreat of the trees towards the inland, creating highly unfavourable settings for peat accumulation in this region (W\u00fcst et al., 2007). Variations in meteorological conditions, sea level and vegetation confined the peat sediments to accumulate in coastal areas, regional depressions, and elevated regions, which allowed the build-up of organic matter (W\u00fcst et al., 2007). The available ages of the peatlands suggest that some of them started accumulating as early as Late Pleistocene (32,800\u00a0years BP) but became very extensive and rapid during the Holocene (last 10,000\u00a0years BP; Biswas, 1973; Stattegger et al., 1997; Treat et al., 2019; Fig. 5A). The sudden transition to a more humid climate with higher rainfall rate in the Late Pleistocene (Whitmore, 1981) is most likely the main factor for the initiation of peat (Verstappen, 1975; van der Kaars and Dam, 1995; Kienast et al., 2003).\nRight after the LGM (approximately at 15,000\u00a0years BP), the global temperatures increased and sea-level started rising resulting in an increased rate of peat initiation on the exposed continental shelves. However, fast sea-level rising till Middle Holocene (until ca. 8200\u00a0years BP) flooded these areas and the peatlands were buried by rapid sediment supply whereas the overall initiation of peats was decelerated (Treat et al., 2019). The fast sea level rise in the Holocene affected the depositional plains of the rivers, which migrated inland and hence, in turn, the fluvial-related peatlands were affected accordingly (Hanebuth and Stattegger, 2003; W\u00fcst et al., 2007). Subsequently stabilisation of sea level, maximum rainfall and the rise of the inland groundwater table accelerated the built-up of both buried and new peatlands in Southeast Asia (Dommain et al., 2011; Treat et al., 2019). This phenomenon mostly affected the lowland areas, such as east Sumatra, Borneo and peninsular Malaysia, resulting in the accumulation of vast amounts of peat along the new coasts (Tjia et al., 1984; Sinsakul, 1992; Bird et al., 2007).\nThe average accumulation rate during and right after the LGM was 0.04\u00a0mm\/yr, which increased by the Early Holocene to 2.55\u00a0mm\/yr and finally during the Middle and Late Holocene peat accumulation was generally much faster with rates generally exceeding 2.5\u00a0mm\/yr and reaching even up to 13\u00a0mm\/yr in Sumatra (Neuzil, 1997; Page et al., 2004; Hope et al., 2005; W\u00fcst et al., 2007). No new peat initiation is reported from the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP) and onwards. We speculate that the general decrease of the sea level the last 3000\u00a0years below a threshold of +1.5\u00a0m from the MSL (Tjia and Fujii, 1992; Tjia, 1996) combined with the cooling DACP and Little Ice Age period (220\u201320\u00a0years ago; Pan et al., 2020) may have a pronounced effect, likely creating unfavoured conditions in the Late Holocene to trigger new peat formation.\n\n\n5.6\nAdverse effects from the poor management of the Southeast Asian peatlands\nThe tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia include more than 70% of the Earth's tropical peat carbon stock but unfortunately, they are gradually converted to sources of atmospheric carbon, as the degradation of these peatlands results in the increase of carbon dioxide emission over the last few decades (Koh et al., 2009; Page et al., 2011; Miettinen et al., 2016; Dohong et al., 2017; Cole et al., 2022). Page et al. (2011) report that since the 1990s, the Southeast Asia region had lost about 28% of its total regional peat carbon pool. Joosten (2010) and Page et al. (2011) report that the Southeast Asian peatlands are important carbon sinks for approximately 69 Gt of carbon whereas 7\u20138\u00a0years later Page and Rieley (2018) reported that the carbon storage had been reduced to approximately 50 Gt. Therefore, we can infer that a further rapid reduction of 19 Gt (that is an extra 27.5% relative to the 69 Gt in 2010\u20132011) in the carbon storage capacity of the Southeast Asian peatlands in about 7\u20138\u00a0years (2010\u20132011 to 2018) occurred, indicating a rapidly accelerating rate of carbon emissions from these peatlands. Most of the peatlands in Southeast Asia are experiencing drastic disruption due to various anthropogenic activities, such as drainage and deforestation, conversion to plantations, hence increasing their susceptibility to drought and wildfires (Melling et al., 2005; Miettinen et al., 2012; Muller et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2022). The decrease of moisture in peat combined with a fire source (either natural heat\/lightning or through human activities) is sufficient to spark wildfires (e.g., Page et al., 2009a; Gandois et al., 2014; Page and Hooijer, 2016). Fire events often result in haze in the Southeast Asian region, causing serious problems for public health and the environment (Miettinen et al., 2011; Putra et al., 2019). In contrast, pristine tropical peatlands are permanently wet, thus fires are not common and are reported as anomalies. Apart from inhibiting wildfires, the position of the groundwater table in relation to the mire\/peatland surface and thus, peat moisture are crucial factors for influencing its ability to store carbon (Usup et al., 2004; Hirano et al., 2007; Kettridge et al., 2015). Hooijer et al. (2010) showed a relationship between the groundwater table and carbon emission of tropical peatland in that every 10\u00a0cm of lowering of the water table results in an increased emission rate of 9.1\u00a0t\/ha.yr. Drainage causes the groundwater table to fall, which in turn causes peatlands to subside as low moisture hinders bogs to preserve the dome shape (Kool et al., 2006). In well-humified (hemic and sapric) peatlands the groundwater table drops faster, during fires or droughts, but recovers faster after a rain, as well, unlike the non-humified (fibric) peat, which have a higher water-adsorption capacity thus preventing moisture to return to the groundwater (Taufik et al., 2019).\nThe Mega Rice Project is a striking example of adverse effects resulting from the disruption of the peatland ecosystems of Indonesia. This project started in 1996 in Kalimantan aiming at converting huge areas of \u201cunproductive\u201d mires into rice paddies to fight food shortage in Indonesia. Extensive logging and constructions of ditches caused broad drainage and triggered multiple wildfires due to spontaneous combustion of the dried peat, which eventually burned and downgraded major areas of peatlands (Page and Hooijer, 2016). The density of the peat fires was found to increase within peatlands converted to oil palm and sago plantations and the expanded settlements in central Kalimantan (Cattau et al., 2016). In addition, lowering of the groundwater levels in these areas resulted in further oxidation of the upper surfaces of the peatlands and hence increasing CO2 emissions (Hirano et al., 2014). Regenerated forests within the project's degraded areas have recorded low diversity (Blackham et al., 2014). Thus, proper land management is important to mitigate the impact of these wildfires on the environment (Miettinen et al., 2011, 2017; Cole et al., 2019; Waldron et al., 2019).\n\nAnshari et al. (2010) provided an extensive review of the Tasik Bera peatland in peninsular Malaysia and peatlands in west Kalimantan along with primary data interpretation. They examine the effect of land use on peat degradation and carbon storage. Their extensive dataset of several parameters (pH, dry bulk density, loss on ignition, gravimetric water content, volumetric water content, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C\/N ratio), highlights that the degraded peatlands (used for agricultural activities) have higher total nitrogen and lower C\/N ratios in comparison to the intact ones. They suggest that the above N enrichment is a direct imprint of fertilisers used in oil palm plantations. Overall, the authors find out that the disturbed peatlands have generally higher pH, dry bulk density and total nitrogen values, as well as lower C\/N ratios, compared to pristine mires. No significant variations are observed for the loss-on-ignition and the total organic carbon between the degraded and the undisturbed peatlands.\n\n\n5.7\nStatistical overview of the reported parameters\nTwo principal components (PCs) are plotted for analysis, based on three parameters (maximum ash yield, basal age and maximum thickness) from the reviewed peatlands in Southeast Asia (Fig. 6\n). PC 1 and PC 2 describe a percentage variance of 81.6% and 12.3%, respectively, hence PCA obtained a cumulative proportion of variance in the data of 93.9% (Table 3\n). The reviewed peatlands from Indochina, the Philippines and New Guinea lack complete datasets of all the above three parameters (Table A5 in supplementary appendix) and therefore only data from the rest areas are considered for the PCA graph. The peatlands in the bottom left quadrant are highly characterised by basal age and those in the top left quadrant by maximum thickness. All three parameters have nearly similar contribution to PC 1 whereas basal age has high positive and maximum thickness has considerable negative contribution to PC 2 (Table 4\n).\nOn the PCA plot, the peatlands in the LGP are highly characterised by basal age, as they are projected in a similar direction (Fig. 6A) with the basal age vector (Fig. 6B). Peatlands in the Mild Cooling, Warming and Fast Fluctuating periods are the most similar to each other, based on their proximity, in terms of all the three parameters and are highly characterised by maximum thickness and\/or maximum ash yield. The majority of the peatlands of Borneo (13 out of 21 or 62%) initiated in the Warming period whereas fewer peatlands are associated with the Mild Cooling (19%), Fast Fluctuating (10%) and LGP (10%) periods. We can also observe that many peatlands with a river substrate are related to the Warming Period (Fig. 6A). Most of the peatlands with marine and brackish or fluvial and alluvial or both types of substrate facies are ombrogenous and overall they are highly characterised by maximum ash yield and\/or maximum thickness, as they are found either along the abscissa (parallel to the maximum ash yield vector) or oriented along the maximum thickness vector in the top left quadrant. Maximum ash yield strongly characterises the peatlands in Malay Peninsula followed, in decreasing strength, by those in Sumatra and then those occurring on Borneo Island.\nMaximum thickness has very low correlation with maximum age, as it is indicated by their near perpendicular vectors (Fig. 6B). This may suggest that the thick peatlands of the top quadrant were accumulated faster than the thick peatlands of the bottom quadrant. Maximum ash yield vector is plotted nearly along the abscissa and at low angles with regards to both the basal age and maximum thickness indicating a moderate correlation of the first parameter with the rest two (Fig. 6B).\nPCA was used on a few alternative scenarios, as well as a few different imputation approaches and choices of parameters, and we were able to identify relationships between characteristics of peatlands in terms of their physical and descriptive characteristics (i.e., ash yield, thickness, age, peatland type, region, substrate origin and climatic periods). While missing data are imputed, using median values of the region, and the data plotted using simple data visualisation (ellipses for periods, shapes and colours for other characteristics), the PCA biplots suggested interesting relationships of the peatland characteristics, which can be confirmed with future reported data.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nPeatlands are the largest natural carbon storage systems on the planet and in this regard Southeast Asia, which includes more than half of the global area of tropical peatlands, is a very important region, largely contributing to the global atmospheric CO2 budget. Extensive adverse anthropogenic factors and poor management of the Southeast Asian peatlands resulted in accelerated carbon emissions the recent years increasing the carbon footprint of the area on the planet and adversely contributing to the global climate change.\nThe geological parameters of the Southeast Asian peatlands have generally been understudied, despite their scientific importance and their significance to the society. Very little or no geological research has been done particularly in Indonesia (excluding Sumatra and Borneo), Indochina Peninsula, the Philippines and New Guinea. Comprehensive information exists only for a few peatlands of great interest (e.g., Mega Rice Project area), whereas most of the rest sites document selective data only. Likely, the limited studies on the Southeast Asian peatlands are due to the fact that they commonly occur in remote and inaccessible areas of thick rainforests, as well as risks involved during fieldwork like the presence of wild animals and\/or dangerous plants.\nThe available data suggest that the Southeast Asian peatlands are mostly ombrotrophic and hence, poorly fed by nutrients with local minerotrophic places occurring only at flat basins around and beneath the ombrotrophic mires. However, topogenous (or minerotrophic) peatlands are commonly small and together with the above restrictions in studying these peatlands, it is possible that their spatial distribution is underestimated. The peatlands initiated in the Late Pleistocene but their accumulation culminated in the wetter Holocene epoch, and when the sea level was higher or similar to the MSL, favouring the coastal areas of Southeast Asia.\nPeatlands are among the most complex environments, of high ecological value, associated with geological and biological processes, which are significantly interconnected. Therefore, the comprehensive geological study is a prerequisite for any management plan. The minimum geological information, which is required to understand the evolution of a peatland, as well as their adaptation in the climatic fluctuations, include detail lithological\/stratigraphical modelling of the vertical and lateral expansion of the organic sediments, ash yield, pH, organic and inorganic matter characterisation, and radiometric ages. Without this basic data any management policy and\/or implementation of mitigation measures are probably going to fail. Moreover, such a complete dataset is of a great scientific importance as it is required for a regional model for the formation of the peatlands in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nMuhammad Syazwan Omar: Data collection, curation and classification, writing, validation, review and editing.

Globally, these constructed impoundments predominantly include (i) water-retention (or reservoir) dams built for irrigation, flood control (disaster mitigation), water supply, hydroelectric power generation and other purposes (Baxter, 1977; ICOLD, 2020) and (ii) tailings storage facilities (TSFs) built to contain fine-grained, wet, environmentally hazardous sediments that are waste by-products of mineral extraction operations (Vick, 1983; Blight, 2010; Rana et al., 2021a). The number of human-made reservoir dams worldwide likely exceeds 200,000 (USACE, 2019; Ge et al., 2020; ICOLD, 2020). Over 50,000 of these reservoir dams are reported in the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD, 2020) Registry based on their conformance to the ICOLD definition of \u201clarge\u201d dams \u2013 i.e. those with storage capacities of \u22653 million (M) m3 or dam heights of \u226515\u00a0m. These are referred to as large reservoir facilities (or LRFs) in this study. The historical number of constructed TSFs worldwide is in the order of 30,000 according to the World Mine Tailings Failures organization (WMTF, 2020). Projects requiring the construction of water-retention dams and TSFs have spurred socioeconomic development worldwide since the 1950s, commensurate with the rising demand for energy production, food, mineral resources and other benefits (e.g. Mudd and Boger, 2013; Dutta et al., 2016; Di Baldassarre et al., 2018; Boulange et al., 2021; Vaidya et al., 2021).\nThe principal requirement for engineers when designing and operating water-retention dams and TSFs is to ensure their safety throughout the project duration. The performance of these facilities poses a global engineering challenge (Oliver-Smith, 1996; Santamarina et al., 2019; ICMM et al., 2020), especially since they are important strategic components in the emerging green\/renewable economy and continued efforts for sustainability (e.g. Dutta et al., 2016; Herrington, 2021; Vaidya et al., 2021). However, catastrophic impoundment failures have resulted in high costs and long-lasting environmental harm over extensive inundation areas (Kossoff et al., 2014; Bowker and Chambers, 2015, 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO), 2020, 2021; de Lima et al., 2020; Latrubesse et al., 2020; Ghahramani et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021; Rana et al., 2021a; Yu et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022). Satellite images of some recent high-profile failures are shown in Fig. 1\n. Weather hazards are among the most frequent failure causes of recent cases (e.g. Robertson et al., 2019; ASDSO, 2020, 2021; Latrubesse et al., 2020; Rana et al., 2021a; Yu et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2022). Floods from failed reservoir dams have caused over 40,000 deaths worldwide since 1965 (Zhang et al., 2016). Over the same period, at least 2000 people have died due to TSF failures (Santamarina et al., 2019; Islam and Murakami, 2021; WISE, 2021), including 272 in the 2019 Feijao disaster in Brazil (Fig. 1d; de Lima et al., 2020). These events have raised concern about the long-term safety of engineered impoundments, especially against the backdrop of a changing climate, heightened public pressure (i.e. lower societal tolerance for dam-related adverse consequences), growth in exposed population and increased resource demands (Oliver-Smith, 1996; Guthrie, 2015; Best, 2019; Santamarina et al., 2019; ICMM et al., 2020; Herrington, 2021).\nThe global performance and safety of engineered dams can be inferred by examining historical magnitude-frequency statistics of their failures and societal (human and environmental) consequences. However, the last review of failure statistics for large reservoir dams (global excluding China) was published over two decades ago (without an assessment of magnitude) and requires updating (Foster et al., 2000). The spatiotemporal distributions of TSF failures have been explored in histograms (Azam and Li, 2010; Lyu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022; Piciullo et al., 2022) whereas Rana et al. (2021a) estimated the recurrence rate of tailings flows (i.e. downstream mass flows from failed TSFs), but these studies did not cast a wider focus on TSF failure and fatality rates and the mean return periods of TSF failure consequences. Thus, at present, the failure statistics of both reservoir dams and TSFs remain poorly quantified, out-of-date and\/or limited in scope.\nThe sparsity of comprehensive magnitude-frequency investigations to date is mainly attributed to pre-existing failure datasets that are incomplete or contain poorly constrained data, and in the case of TSFs, the substandard public disclosures of facility construction (Franks et al., 2021). The resulting lack of up-to-date, normalized statistical insights hinders a clear understanding of how the hazard-risk of water-retention dams and TSFs has evolved over time, which may lead to public misconceptions and inconsistent claims. For example, the assumption of lower-estimates of the number of TSFs worldwide (e.g. ~3500 in the year 2000; Davies et al., 2000; Davies, 2002) and\/or underestimates of the number of water-retention dams worldwide has contributed to interpretations that the failure rate of TSFs is several times (Lyu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2021) or more than two orders of magnitude (Azam and Li, 2010) greater than that of water-retention dams. However, when assuming the newer, upper-estimate range of 29,000\u201335,000 TSFs as proposed by WMTF (2020) based on national inventories and published estimates (e.g. ~12,000 TSFs in China alone; Pan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017), these interpretations fail to hold true. These inconsistencies underscore the challenges associated with obtaining best-estimates of the \u201ctrue\u201d global failure rates of both types of engineered structures, as well as the detailed effort necessary to arrive to more representative conclusions that could ultimately clarify existing misconceptions, advance scientific knowledge and benefit future risk assessments.\n\n\n1.2\nScope and objectives\nIn this study, we undertake a comprehensive review of existing databases and published estimates and use statistical extrapolation and estimation approaches to fill data gaps, in an effort to illustrate the range of uncertainty in our results depending on the underlying assumptions. The objective in performing a detailed review of literature is to evaluate how statistically complete the construction and failure records are, which is an important first step to conducting magnitude-frequency and failure rate assessments. This step enables us to simplify our analysis by focusing on a specific study period for which the required data can be procured or reasonable estimates can be generated. In this case, we select a 56-year period of 1965\u20132020 due to the insufficient documentation of pre-1965 construction and failures.\nWe then assess the magnitude thresholds above which the record is either complete over the study period, or for which the degree of incompleteness can be addressed by means of approximation. Here, we find that focusing on LRFs only, rather than all reservoir facilities (for which the construction record is largely incomplete), is the most practical approach due to the recently issued ICOLD (2020) Registry. The number and magnitude of LRF failures can be extracted or minimum-estimated from U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR, 2015) and Zhang et al. (2016) for all countries except China, for which documentation on reservoir facility failures is sparse due to confidentiality. This issue was also encountered by Foster et al. (2000), who consequently excluded China from their statistical analysis. To build on preceding work, we present two \u201cglobal estimation scenarios\u201d (an upper-estimate and a lower-estimate) based on our analysis of historical frequency numbers of reservoir dam failures in China that are tabulated in Ge et al. (2020).\nWith regards to the number of constructed TSFs and the volume of produced tailings, the lack of an international registry necessitates us to present two \u201cglobal extrapolation approaches\u201d based on our analysis of mineral commodity production data (BGS, 2021; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2021): one produces an upper-estimate closer to that proposed by WMTF (2020) and the other produces a lower-estimate that aligns with interpretations in previous studies (e.g. Davies et al., 2000; Davies, 2002; Lyu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2021). The historical number of TSF failures worldwide is relatively well-documented in published datasets (e.g. ICOLD, 2001; Bowker and Chambers, 2015; Rana et al., 2021b; Islam and Murakami, 2021; Piciullo et al., 2022).\nBy these advances, we are able to set the central goal of our statistical analysis: to quantify the magnitude-frequency distributions and the cumulative failure and fatality rates of LRFs and TSFs worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. The specific research questions that we seek to address by our statistical analysis to gain novel insights are as follows:\n\n1.\nHow has the construction and failure frequency of LRFs and TSFs evolved over time?\n\n\n2.\nWhat are the statistically important causative variables of LRF and TSF failures worldwide?\n\n\n3.\nHow often have LRF and TSF failures above a specified magnitude (e.g. storage capacity, released volume, inundation area or fatality) occurred?\n\n\n4.\nHow have the average size of LRF and TSF failures and the environmental consequences of TSF failures evolved over time?\n\n\n5.\nWhat fraction of the globally impounded freshwater and tailings has undergone failure\/release over time?\n\n\n6.\nWhat are the global cumulative failure and fatality rates of LRFs and TSFs as of end-of-2020 depending on our different statistical approaches and assumptions?\n\n\n7.\nWhat are the implications of our statistical findings with respect to previous studies and interpretations and to the engineering properties and global safety of LRFs and TSFs?\n\n\n\nOur global analysis focuses on LRFs and TSFs as distinct engineered structures, which allows a comparison between their failure statistics. At the outset, it should be emphasized that there are fundamental differences in their engineering characteristics (Section 2) and the sources of their data uncertainties (Sections 3 and 4), all of which ultimately influence their respective failure statistics and corresponding implications (Sections 5 and 6). Our analysis does not consider failure risk from war damage and excludes levees and dikes \u2013 i.e. engineered structures that prevent coastal and riverine flooding. For clarity and consistency, Table 1\n provides a list of key terminologies relevant to this study and Table 2\n provides the definitions of the various statistical metrics and variables that are used or analyzed in this article.\nOur findings are presented with cognizance of the uncertainties that underlie the collated data, the methods used to address existing data gaps, and our statistical estimates. Notwithstanding these limitations, our work is timely and sheds light on the background hazard-risk of engineered impoundments worldwide. Moreover, the data and results presented herein benefit industrial practice by providing benchmark values to support future risk assessments.\n\n\n\n2\nCharacteristics of engineered impoundments\n\n2.1\nReservoir facilities\nReservoir dams are designed to retain water, predominantly freshwater. In most cases, this is achieved by blocking and controlling the flow of rivers. Another common approach is to build a dam across the outlet from a natural lake. The societal functions for reservoir facilities include irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, flood control, water supply, fish farming, recreation and\/or navigation (Baxter, 1977; ICOLD, 2020). Large reservoirs occupy volumes in the order of tens to hundreds of M m3 (e.g. Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Article; Rana et al., 2022). These projects may result in large-scale modification of natural landscapes, including catchment-wide implications for surface water and groundwater flow patterns, sediment flux and ecological diversity (e.g. Baxter, 1977; Yang et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2015). Globally, reservoirs are estimated to represent >15% of the annual global runoff, and the surface area of formerly terrestrial habitat now inundated by reservoirs is about the size of France (Nilsson, 2009) or the entire Columbia River drainage basin in North America.\nThe engineering design of reservoir facilities depends on the terrain, project requirements and economic feasibility. There are two principal kinds of reservoirs: storage reservoirs that sustain flow into the downstream channels and control ordinary fluctuations in discharge, and run-of-the-river impoundments that balance daily variations in the demands for water-to-electricity production by generating hydraulic head (Nilsson, 2009). Foster et al. (2000) identified 12 distinct zoning categories for 11,192 large reservoir dams built worldwide (except China and pre-1930 Japan) up to 1986. Earthfill dams (homogeneous earthfill, zoned earthfill, concrete-face earthfill or earthfill with filter) comprised the majority with about 70%, whereas rockfill dams (zoned earthfill and rockfill dams, concrete-face rockfill dams and central core earth and rockfill dams) made up over 20%.\nThe potential failure modes for LRFs predominantly include dam overtopping and internal erosion (Foster et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016) and in some cases spillway collapse (e.g. Independent Forensic Team Report, 2018) or seismic\/static liquefaction of the dam (e.g. Seed et al., 1975; ASDSO, 2021).\n\n\n2.2\nTailings storage facilities (TSFs)\nTSFs are designed to store wet, environmentally hazardous sediments (tailings) that comprise the waste by-products at mineral extraction and processing sites, including some industrial and power plant operations (Blight, 2010). In some cases, ponded wastewater (supernatant ponds) may overlie the tailings to prevent the generation of surface dusts and acidic drainage and provide reclaim water for use in the milling process. These materials are impounded by a compacted dam that is typically built out of waste earthfill\/rockfill, foundation fill and\/or the coarse fraction of tailings (Blight, 2010). By convention, the tailings are hydraulically discharged into the facility over the duration of the project. On a much smaller scale, some mines produce and store dry-stack and filtered tailings with lower moisture contents (Williams, 2021). In contrast to dams built to contain reservoirs, tailings dams are progressively raised in stages for several years to decades, commensurate with the rising volume of stored tailings. The dam raise direction may be upstream (i.e. over the impounded tailings), downstream and\/or vertically upwards (centerline method) (Blight, 2010; Kossoff et al., 2014). Some of the largest TSFs in the world have storage capacities of over 100\u00a0M\u00a0m3 and exceed 200\u00a0m in dam height (Supplementary Figs. S17 and S18; Rana et al., 2022). The construction and permanent presence of large TSFs can have long-term implications for local\/regional hydrological and hydrogeological regimes (e.g. Ochieng et al., 2010).\nThe spatial configuration of TSFs can be diverse depending on the site topography and the project design requirements. Some examples include: (i) fully enclosed impoundments on near-flat terrains (ring-dykes); (ii) partially enclosed impoundments on hillslopes; (iii) impoundments enclosed by a cross-valley embankment; and (iv) tailings storage in open-pit lakes. At any point in time, the status of a TSF is one of the following: (i) active (construction, disposal and other operations are ongoing at the TSF); (ii) inactive (construction, disposal and other operations have temporarily or permanently ceased at the TSF); (iii) closed (the TSF has been officially decommissioned to be reclaimed by responsible authorities and integrated into the landscape); or (iv) abandoned (the entire mine site has ceased all operations and projects, and the site has been abandoned). The monitoring and management of legacy tailings is a topical contemporary issue due to the growing number of abandoned mine sites worldwide (e.g. Courchesne et al., 2021; Gauthier-Manuel et al., 2021).\nThe potential failure modes for TSFs commonly include seismic or static liquefaction of the impounded tailings, dam overtopping by ponded wastewater, internal erosion of the dam core and embankment instability (ICOLD, 2001; Lyu et al., 2019; Rana et al., 2021a; Piciullo et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n3\nReview of datasets and statistical studies\n\nTable 3\n lists published datasets of the construction and failures of reservoir facilities and TSFs, with reference to the study authors, dataset focus and purpose, temporal coverage and number of entries. Table 4\n lists recently developed geospatial datasets of reservoir facilities and mine infrastructure (including TSFs).\n\n3.1\nReservoir facilities\n\n3.1.1\nConstructed facilities\nThe ICOLD Registry is the authoritative source on constructed LRFs worldwide. The most recent update to the Registry was issued in April 2020 (ICOLD, 2020) and includes 58,713 reservoir dams built up to 2020, with the addition of a few under-construction and planned projects. The ICOLD (2020) Registry was specifically aimed towards large reservoir dams that impound \u22653\u00a0M\u00a0m3 or those with heights of \u226515\u00a0m for completeness, although the time period for completeness was not stated. With the exception of some of the largest reservoir facilities in the world, the vast majority of the reservoir facilities listed in the Registry are impounded behind a single dam.\nThe true number of all reservoir facilities worldwide is unknown, but is likely to exceed 200,000, with ~91,500 catalogued in the USA (USACE, 2019; DeNeale et al., 2019) and\u00a0~\u00a098,000 present in China (Ge et al., 2020). Aside from reservoir facility name, owner and geographic location (town and country), the ICOLD (2020) Registry reported additional data at varying degrees of completeness, including dam type (87% of listed reservoir facilities), year of construction (88%), dam height (99%), dam crest length (60%), storage capacity (97%), societal purpose (67%), surface area (44%) and catchment area (29%). Mulligan et al. (2020) employed an automated algorithm on Google Earth Engine to develop a global geospatial database (with reported coordinates) of over 38,000 reservoir dams from the ICOLD (2020) Registry (Table 4).\n\n\n3.1.2\nFailures\nThe compilation of reservoir facility failures has mainly been intended for empirical modelling of breach-outflow (MacDonald and Langridge-Monopolis, 1984; Costa, 1985; Wahl, 1998; Zhong et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2016) provided the largest open-access dataset of reservoir facility failures to date, although with limited quantitative data and with the exclusion of all failures in China. Of the 1443 events in the period 1799\u20132005 that were included, 316 cases (22%) reported storage capacity, 100 cases (7%) reported the volume above the breach invert (i.e. volume of released water), 1105 cases (77%) reported dam height, 570 cases (40%) reported the year of construction of the failed reservoir facility, 171 cases (12%) reported some description of breach geometry (breach height or width), 62 cases (4%) reported peak outflow and 1217 cases (84%) reported failure causes or failure modes.\nThe documentation of reservoir facility failures in China remains publicly inaccessible. However, Ge et al. (2020) provided a summary table of the number of reservoir facility failures in China in the period 1954\u20132014. They reported a total of 3529 failures, with the annual national average calculated to be 65 in the period 1954\u20131965, 152 in the period 1966\u20131976, 43 in the period 1977\u20131999 and 5 in the period 2000\u20132014. When adding 1443 reservoir facility failures worldwide excluding China (Zhang et al., 2016) and 3529 reservoir facility failures in China (Ge et al., 2020), this equals to almost 5000 reservoir facility failures that have been reported worldwide in recorded history.\n\nFoster et al. (2000) conducted a detailed statistical assessment of the failures of large reservoir dams constructed up to 1986, excluding those in Japan pre-1930 and in China due to poor data availability. They estimated a failure rate (= number of failures \/ number of constructed facilities, expressed as a percentage) of 1.2% for 11,192 large embankment dams. Foster et al. (2000) and Zhang et al. (2016) observed that the highest statistical likelihood for the failure of a reservoir facility is within the first 5\u00a0years of operation, although the exact proportion varies depending on the failure mode and the dam zoning category. The two studies also noted that overtopping and internal erosion (i.e. piping) together comprise 80\u201390% of reported failure modes. This range is higher than the ~62% proposed by Costa (1985) \u2013 the other failure mode being foundation defects \u2013 based on an analysis of failure modes of large reservoir dams listed in the ICOLD Registry that was issued at the time.\n\n\n\n3.2\nTailings storage facilities (TSFs)\n\n3.2.1\nConstructed facilities\nThe total number and the complete geographic distribution of TSFs worldwide remains unknown due to the lack of public disclosure requirements. Davies et al. (2000) and Davies (2002) first suggested a \u201cconservative, lower-bound\u201d estimate of ~3500 TSFs worldwide at the turn of this century. This estimate was cited in Lyu et al. (2019) and Liang et al. (2021). Azam and Li (2010) suggested a much higher figure of 18,401 mine sites worldwide, but the original basis of this estimate was not stated.\n\nWMTF (2020) compiled national inventories and published estimates of TSFs from 22 countries that represent ~60% of the global mineral commodity production in the modern era. They calculated a total of 19,214 TSFs that have been historically constructed in these 22 countries, including active, inactive, closed and abandoned sites. Approximately 12,000 of these TSFs are in China alone (Pan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017), ~43% of which have been georeferenced by Tang et al. (2020). By scaling up the summed number (19,214) to include the other countries that make up the remaining 40% of global mineral production, WMTF (2020) obtained a global estimate of ~32,000 TSFs. When assigning \u00b110% uncertainty boundaries, they proposed that the actual number of existing TSFs worldwide is between 29,000 and 35,000. This estimated range is similar to that proposed in Spencer et al. (2021), who reviewed existing national inventories and reported a minimum-estimate of 13,400\u201315,400 active and inactive TSFs, and remarked that the true number of all existing TSFs worldwide could be in the order of ~30,000 when accounting for abandoned TSFs and poorly reported countries. This suggests that the estimate of 18,401 mines by Azam and Li (2010) may not have been an acute underestimate, especially if one assumes a global average of ~1.7 TSFs per mine site.\n\nFranks et al. (2021) presented the first disclosure database of TSFs. Their data is derived from a detailed, but statistically incomplete, record collated through voluntary survey responses from publicly-listed mineral extraction companies. The final database included 1743 TSFs (~6% of the historical estimate by WMTF, 2020), 725 of which were active as of 2021. Information such as geographic coordinates, primary commodity, status, construction commencement year, dam raise type, storage capacity and hazard classification were all reported. Their database did not include TSFs that are abandoned, state-owned, privately-owned, small-scale and\/or artisanal, as well as tailings that are not stored in conventional impoundments (e.g. heap leach pads that can extract copper, nickel, uranium and precious metals by chemical processes via emplaced liners). Moreover, only four TSFs situated in China were reported in the disclosure database. By proportionally extrapolating data in comparison to global mineral commodity production (using calculated mean stored volume per TSF per primary commodity), Franks et al. (2021) estimated that the total number of active TSFs worldwide is ~3400, and a \u201cconservative, lower-bound estimate\u201d for the total number of active, inactive and closed TSFs (excluding abandoned sites) is ~8100.\nBoth WMTF (2020) and Franks et al. (2021) reported an acceleration in the global annual production of mineral commodities, which they interpret to correspond to an accelerating number of TSFs constructed worldwide. They also suggested that TSFs may be increasing in storage volume on average, although temporal box-and-whisker plot distributions of the incomplete disclosure data provided in Franks et al. (2021) does not provide evidence for this suggestion (see Fig. S16 in the Supplementary Article; Rana et al., 2022).\nAs listed in Table 4, recent global-scale remote sensing studies have mapped over 6000 mine sites, with the total surface area of remotely visible mines measured to be 57,300\u00a0km2 by Maus et al. (2020) (about the size of Croatia) and 31,400\u00a0km2 by Liang et al. (2021) (about the size of Belgium). The significant difference between the two measurements is attributed to the difference in mapping methodologies and associated uncertainties. Werner et al. (2020) mapped distinct mine infrastructure features in 295 publicly-owned active mines and measured the total surface area of 267 TSFs across these select mines to be 918\u00a0km2. Tang et al. (2020) mapped 5189 TSFs in China and obtained a total surface area of 1884\u00a0km2. By extrapolation from a mine area vs. TSF area relationship using data from Werner et al. (2020) and our independent geospatial mapping, the global surface area of TSFs is estimated to be in the order of 5400\u00a0km2 (see Section 2.4 and Fig. S22 in the Supplementary Article; Rana et al., 2022).\n\n\n3.2.2\nFailures\nCompared to reservoir facility failures, the number of TSF failures over time is relatively well-documented. ICOLD (2001) developed the first global database of 221 TSF failures that occurred in the period 1917\u20131996. They reported, at varying degrees of completeness, the mine location (state\/province and country), dam raise method, dam height, impoundment volume, failure mode, ore type, released volume and runout distance. ICOLD (2001) also included incident summaries that provided context to each event. Bowker and Chambers (2015) built on ICOLD (2001) by documenting 226 events in the period 1917\u20132009.\n\nRico et al. (2008) extracted data from ICOLD (2001) to develop the first empirical relationship between released volume and runout distance, which was later updated by Larrauri and Lall (2018). Ghahramani et al. (2020) used geographic information systems (GIS) methods and satellite imagery to map 33 tailings flows that occurred since 1965. They developed an empirical relationship between released volume and the \u201cprimary impact zone\u201d, or Zone 1, planimetric inundation area. Rana et al. (2021a, 2021b) subsequently produced a database of 63 tailings flows that occurred in the period 1928\u20132020 by screening an inventory of 362 mine waste failures since 1915 based on some case selection criteria. They presented empirical relationships between released volume and GIS-mapped runout distance, inundation area and travel path angle in Zone 1 according to the travel path channelization. They also performed a cumulative volume-frequency analysis of tailings flows and estimated that tailings flows with volumes of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 have occurred once every 2\u20133\u00a0years worldwide since 1965, on average.\nThe pre-existing datasets that were consulted by Rana et al. (2021b) included Bowker and Chambers (2015) and Small et al. (2017), which predominantly focused on tailings, but also included some incidents involving other categories of mine waste, such as coarse colliery waste (e.g. 1972 Buffalo Creek, USA; Davies et al., 1972; Wahler and Associates, 1973), spoil tips (e.g. 1966 Aberfan, Wales; Bishop, 1973) and waste rock piles (e.g. 1985 Quintette, Canada; Dawson et al., 1998). This mixing of mine waste storage types was also observed in the supplementary data of Islam and Murakami (2021). This inconsistency is likely due to the vague definitions of tailings and TSFs in literature preceding Franks et al. (2021) and Rana et al. (2021a, 2021b), and the sparsity of reported information on low-consequence failure events.\n\nFranks et al. (2021) noted that ~10% of disclosed TSFs had experienced a \u201cstability concern\u201d at some point in the operational history (note that a \u201cstability concern\u201d does not necessarily equate to failure). Historical statistics indicate that the number of TSF failures increased dramatically in the 1960s (commensurate with the global increase in mining activity) and that the failure frequency has stayed relatively constant since then at around 35\u201350 events per decade (Lyu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022;\nPiciullo et al., 2022). The proportional contribution of weather hazards and drainage mismanagement as failure causes has increased over time, whereas that of seismic activity has reduced (Azam and Li, 2010; Rana et al., 2021a). The failure modes are statistically well-distributed among overtopping, internal erosion and seismic\/static liquefaction (Lyu et al., 2019; Piciullo et al., 2022).\n\nAzam and Li (2010) suggested a historical, global failure rate of 1.2% for TSFs (i.e. 220 failures \/ 18,400 mines, assuming 1 TSF per mine). Halabi et al. (2022) assumed the global estimate of 18,400 existing TSFs and calculated the annual probability of TSF failures to have been in the order of 10\u22124 on average in the period 1950\u20132019. They also estimated a historical casualty rate of 9 deaths per TSF failure on average for this period.\n\n\n\n\n4\nMethods\nMagnitude-frequency analyses can generate statistical insights into the rates and impacts of recurring hazardous phenomena at regional to global scales. The approach was initially developed to analyze earthquake statistics (Gutenberg and Richter, 1954). Since then, the magnitude-frequency statistics of natural landslides and natural dams have been investigated as well (e.g. Guthrie and Evans, 2004; Evans, 2006; Hungr et al., 2008; Evans et al., 2011; Carrivick and Tweed, 2016). When it comes to anthropogenic hazards such as LRFs and TSFs, the main challenge has been to establish data completeness for specified magnitude and time intervals. Addressing this gap would help generate reasonable estimates of mean return periods and cumulative failure and fatality rates. In turn, this would provide insight into how the hazard-risk of LRFs and TSFs has evolved over time, and would provide quantitative benchmarks for estimating the likelihoods of facility failures and their societal impacts to support future risk assessments.\n\nFig. 2\n shows a flowchart that summarizes our data collection, estimation and extrapolation approaches and the associated uncertainties that form the basis of our statistical analysis of the failures of LRFs and TSFs. The main challenge in the effort to estimate cumulative failure and fatality rates (Section 5.3) is the data sparsity on the number of LRF failures in China (Section 4.3.2) and the number of constructed TSFs worldwide (Section 4.4). We adopted different assumptions and scaling and extrapolation approaches to obtain upper- and lower-estimates for both variables, as described in the following sub-sections.\n\n4.1\nStudy period\nFor our statistical analysis, we set 1965\u20132020 to be the consistent study period for the construction and failures of both LRFs and TSFs for two reasons. First, the mid-1960s was a critical moment for reservoir facility and TSF engineering following a number of disasters, including the 1963 Vajont LRF failure in Italy (ca. 2000 deaths; Paronuzzi et al., 2013), the 1963 Liujiatai LRF failure in China (943 deaths; USBR, 2015), the earthquake-triggered failures of 17 TSFs in 1965 in Chile (>200 deaths caused by the El Cobre tailings flow; Dobry and Alvarez, 1967; Rana et al., 2021a) and the 1966 Aberfan colliery spoil tip failure in Wales (144 deaths; Bishop, 1973). This era marked the beginning of increased public scrutiny and media reporting on reservoir facility and mine waste hazards, concurrent with changes in dam-impoundment design (e.g. the TSF upstream-raise method was banned in Chile). Second, high-resolution, global-coverage satellites were commenced in the mid-1960s with the advent of the Corona satellite, which has allowed for GIS-driven mapping and documentation of failure events and their downstream impacts that have occurred since then (e.g. Ghahramani et al., 2020; Rana et al., 2021a, 2021b).\nBy restricting our statistical analysis to a specific study period, our approach slightly differs from that of Foster et al. (2000), who analyzed the failure rates and probabilities of large reservoir dams constructed worldwide (excluding China) up to a specific year (1986). A limitation of our approach is that some LRF and TSF failures over our study period of 1965\u20132020 occurred in facilities that were constructed before 1965; thus, it should be acknowledged that the selection of the same study period for construction and failures yields some influence on our cumulative failure rate estimates (Section 5.3). However, our approach is the most practical option within the comprehensive scope of the present study (which considers LRF failures in China as well as a global analysis of TSFs) to circumvent issues related to the availability and quality of data preceding 1965. An important precondition to facilitating and simplifying our statistical analyses was to ensure a reasonable degree of dataset completeness and temporal consistency for both LRFs and TSFs. Setting a strict study period of 1965\u20132020 satisfied this objective.\n\n\n4.2\nLarge reservoir facility (LRF) construction\nGiven that the ICOLD (2020) Registry is complete for constructed large reservoir dams, we filtered the dataset for LRFs built in the period 1965\u20132020, leading to a final number of 33,424 sites. We assumed that the number of large reservoir dams in the Registry (33,424) for 1965\u20132020 is roughly equal to the number of LRFs. As a check for uncertainty and error, we compared the number of LRFs constructed in the USA in the period 1965\u20132017 as listed in the ICOLD (2020) Registry to that in the U.S. National Inventory of Dams (USACE, 2019), after filtering the latter by excluding dikes and levees. The number was only about 1% higher in USACE (2019), which indicates low uncertainty.\n\n\n4.3\nLarge reservoir facility (LRF) failures\n\n4.3.1\nGlobal excluding China\nWe filtered the reservoir facility failure dataset in Zhang et al. (2016) for LRF failures. There were 316 listed reservoir facility failures in the period 1965\u20132005 and, based on available data on dam height and\/or storage capacity, we verified that 113 of these events were LRF failures (69% in the USA). This is a global minimum-estimate as all reservoir facility failures in China are missing in this dataset and a majority of the listed cases (especially those in the USA) did not report dam heights and\/or storage capacities (see Section 3.1.2). Only 16 of the 113 events (14%) reported the volume above breach invert (i.e. volume of released water), whereas storage capacity was reported for 65 of the 113 cases (58%). As a result, we chose storage capacity (rather than released volume) as a measure of magnitude for LRF failures in our analysis, but the extracted cumulative storage capacity data still represents a minimum-estimate.\nWe accessed USACE (2019) with the aim of filling in gaps on dam height and storage capacity to check if any of the other reservoir facility failures in USA with missing data can be classified as LRF failures. However, this effort was unsuccessful either because the failure site names listed in Zhang et al. (2016) did not match the constructed dam site names in USACE (2019) or there were multiple dam sites in USACE (2019) that shared duplicate\/similar names.\n\n\n4.3.2\nIncorporating China\nTo incorporate LRF failures in China in our frequency analysis, we consulted Ge et al. (2020), who summarized the number of reservoir facility failures in China in the period 1954\u20132014. The authors did not supply the full database due to confidentiality. Instead, they tabulated the number of failures over the periods 1954\u20131965, 1966\u20131976, 1977\u20131999 and 2000\u20132014 based on the following storage capacity classes set by the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources: 0.1 to 1\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (small reservoir [2]); 1 to 10\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (small reservoir [1]); 10 to 100\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (medium reservoir); 100 to 1000\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (large reservoir [2]); and\u00a0\u2265\u00a01000\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (large reservoir [1]). This means that the classification of large dams by the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources is fundamentally different from that of ICOLD.\nTo estimate the annual numbers of LRF failures in China and subsequently worldwide (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.3), we adopted two different approaches: Estimation Scenario 1 (a scaling-based approach that produces a lower estimate) and Estimation Scenario 2 (an assumption-based approach that leads to a higher estimate). The details for the two scenarios are as follows:\n\n\u2022\nEstimation Scenario 1 (scaling-based approach that represents a lower-estimate):\n\n1.\nUsing the given summary table in Ge et al. (2020), we obtained a sum of ~475 reservoir facilities with storage capacities of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 that failed in China in the period 1965\u20132014. The number of failures in the year 1965 was estimated by annual averaging over the given period of 1954\u20131965.\n\n\n2.\nTo scale this failure number (475) to LRFs, we first calculated the global cumulative failure rate in the period 1965\u20132020 for LRFs with storage capacities of \u226510\u00a0M\u00a0m3, which we deduce to be a statistically complete interval. The obtained rate was 1.2% (101 failed \/ 8313 constructed worldwide), which we assumed to approximately correspond to the global failure rate of all LRFs in the period 1965\u20132020.\n\n\n3.\nBy trial-and-error, we scaled down 475 by a factor of 45% to match the failure rate of 1.2%. By this approach, we estimate that there were 261 LRF failures in China in the period 1965\u20132014 and 394 LRF failures worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020.\n\n\n4.\nTo estimate the annual numbers of LRF failures in China, we applied the scaling factor of \u221245% to the annual averages derived from Ge et al. (2020) to estimate the following for LRF failures in China: 16.9 in 1965; 12.7 per annum in the period 1966\u20131976; 4.1 per annum in the period 1977\u20131999; and 0.8 per annum in the period 2000\u20132014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\nEstimation Scenario 2 (assumption-based approach that represents an upper-estimate): We assumed that the sum of ~475 reservoir facilities with storage capacities of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 that failed in China in the period 1965\u20132014 (estimated from Ge et al., 2020) is approximately equal to the number of LRF failures in China in the same period. By this approach, we estimate that there were 608 LRF failures worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020, and that the annual average numbers of LRF failures in China were as follows: 30.8 in 1965; 23.0 per annum in the period 1966\u20131976; 7.4 per annum in the period 1977\u20131999; and 1.4 per annum in the period 2000\u20132014.\n\n\n\nIn our temporal and normalized rate analyses (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.3 respectively), we presented the results as derived from both estimation scenarios to illustrate the range of uncertainty involved in the number of LRF failures in China and subsequently worldwide.\nTo explain how we incorporated storage capacities of failed reservoir facilities in China in our temporal and cumulative rate analyses, we provide the following example:\n\n1.\nAccording to Ge et al. (2020), there were 231 reservoir facility failures with storage capacities between 1 and 10\u00a0M\u00a0m3 in China in the period 1966\u20131976.\n\n\n2.\nSince the real failure data is not given in Ge et al. (2020) and the average is unknown, to provide a minimum-approximation, we assumed that all of the 231 reservoir facility failures had storage capacities of 1\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (the minimum of a given range), which would yield a total of >231\u00a0M\u00a0m3 in the period 1966\u20131976.\n\n\n3.\nFor annual estimates, we averaged this total number over the corresponding time period (i.e. >21\u00a0M\u00a0m3 per annum in the period 1966\u20131976). The same approach was applied to the higher storage capacity ranges (10\u2013100, 100\u20131000 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a01000\u00a0M\u00a0m3) and the other time intervals (1965, 1977\u20131999 and 2000\u20132014) given in Ge et al. (2020). This approach provides a minimum-approximation for a temporal analysis but is not appropriate for a cumulative volume-frequency plot, which requires real failure data.\n\n\n\nBy reviewing several publications (e.g. Graham, 1999; He et al., 2008; USBR, 2015; Mahmoud et al., 2020) and news articles, we extended our record of LRF failures to include an additional 18 events worldwide (excluding China) in the period 1965\u20132020 that are not found in existing datasets. For fatality-frequency analysis, we extracted life loss data from pre-existing datasets (Graham, 1999; He et al., 2008; USBR, 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Mahmoud et al., 2020). For consistency in our analysis, we filtered the data for fatalities caused by the failures of LRFs. Our review suggests that this dataset is statistically complete for LRF failures worldwide that caused \u226510 deaths in the period 1965\u20132020. The failures of some smaller reservoir facilities have also caused human impacts, but these events were not considered in our fatality assessment.\nAs supplementary material (Rana et al., 2022), we provide a database of 36 LRF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 that were not included in previous global databases or had some gaps that we filled by our review or analysis. We identified the locations of 30 failure sites and supply GIS-processed, pre- and post-event satellite imagery for 19 cases, including the 1975 Banqiao and Shimantan dam breaches in China that collectively caused over 25,000 deaths (e.g. Xu et al., 2008; USBR, 2015). The database file also includes a summary calculation sheet for the two estimation scenarios.\n\n\n\n4.4\nTailings storage facility (TSF) construction\nGiven the incomplete global documentation of existing TSFs, described in Section 3.2, a key objective and contribution of this study was to independently estimate the volume of produced (stored) tailings and the number of constructed TSFs worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. This would help us estimate a more representative cumulative failure rate of TSFs. The most practical approach was to analyze global mineral commodity production data and use published commodity-to-tailings conversion factors, bulk densities, and mean and median storage volumes per TSF per primary commodity. This approach is a more detailed and modified extension to that of Franks et al. (2021) (see Section 3.2.1).\nGlobal mineral production data are available as open-access annual reports issued by the British Geological Survey (BGS, 2021) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, 2021). The reports date back to the 1910s, when it became necessary to document mineral resources for major nations partaking in wartime efforts. We reviewed the disclosure database in Franks et al. (2021) and the mine waste failure database in Islam and Murakami (2021) and selected 13 important commodities for statistical extrapolation: coal\/fly ash, gold, silver, iron, phosphate, zinc, lead, copper, bauxite, aluminum, nickel, diamond and uranium. For our study period of 1965\u20132020, BGS (2021) contained data on all of these commodities, whereas USGS (2021) was missing data on coal\/fly ash. We therefore relied on the BGS (2021) data for our analysis. As a check of uncertainty, we compared annual mineral production values in BGS (2021) versus USGS (2021) and found that the differences were consistently between <1% and 8%.\nFor each year in the period 1965\u20132020, we converted the metric tonnes of produced minerals to tonnes of produced tailings by applying multiplication factors provided in the supplementary information of Bullock et al. (2021). They developed these conversion factors based on the ore type in order to estimate and project the CO2 removal potential from stored tailings worldwide. The conversion factors were not available for coal\/fly ash and phosphate, for which we relied on Joshi and Lohita (1997), Ahmaruzzaman (2010) and Yang et al. (2017). We converted tailings mass to tailings volume by assuming mean bulk density values of specific types of tailings based on our review of numerous publications (e.g. Torres and Brito, 1966; Okusa et al., 1980; Matyas et al., 1984; McGregor and Blowes, 2002; Mecsi, 2013; Morgenstern et al., 2016; Robertson et al., 2019; Boshoff et al., 2018; Jefferies et al., 2019; Behera et al., 2020; Zmemla et al., 2020; Feng and Li, 2021; Rana et al., 2021b; Zubkova et al., 2021). By this approach, we estimated that the total volume of produced (and stored) tailings in the period 1965\u20132020 is just over 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011 m3.\nTo estimate the number of TSFs constructed worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020, we adopted two approaches: the Mean Extrapolation method (which produces a lower-estimate that aligns with interpretations in previous studies) and the Median Extrapolation (which produces a higher and, by our deduction, a more representative estimate) method. The details are as follows:\n\n\u2022\nMean Extrapolation (lower-estimate): We divided the total volume of tailings produced each year by the \u201cmean\u201d volume per TSF of the corresponding primary commodity. These mean values were derived from the incomplete disclosure data in Franks et al. (2021). This approach led to a cumulative estimate of 6810 TSFs constructed in the period 1965\u20132020. In comparison, by a similar mean extrapolation method, Franks et al. (2021) estimated 8100 constructed TSFs throughout history and assigned this number as a \u201cconservative lower-bound\u201d for active, inactive and closed TSFs, but excluding abandoned TSFs.\n\n\n\u2022\nMedian Extrapolation (upper-estimate and potentially representative estimate): We divided the total volume of tailings produced each year by the \u201cmedian\u201d volume per TSF of the corresponding primary commodity. The median values were derived from the disclosure database in Franks et al. (2021). This approach led to a cumulative estimate of 20,230 TSFs constructed in the period 1965\u20132020.\n\n\n\nThere are two major reasons why we find that the median number is more representative. First, in terms of global proportions, the database in Franks et al. (2021) is over-represented by larger-volume TSFs that are commonly built and operated by publicly listed companies. In other words, TSFs that are of smaller sizes, artisanal, privately owned, situated in poorly reported regions (e.g. China, India, South America and Eastern Europe) or abandoned are not represented in Franks et al. (2021), yet their failures are included in global failure datasets (see supplementary data; Rana et al., 2022). This means that the calculated mean per-TSF-per-commodity storage volumes are more statistically influenced by the large TSFs than the calculated median in the disclosure data. For example, the mean storage volumes for copper, iron and phosphate TSFs were calculated to be unrealistically high at 91, 57 and 96\u00a0M\u00a0m3 respectively. In comparison, the median-derived values were 21, 13, and 29\u00a0M\u00a0m3 respectively. As such, the obtained median values are concluded to be closer to the \u201ctrue\u201d global mean of per-TSF storage volumes for all commodities.\nSecond, as described in Section 3.2.1, WMTF (2020) estimated that 29,000\u201335,000 TSFs have been constructed historically worldwide (~12,000 in China alone; Pan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017) based on government inventories, published figures and extrapolation estimates. Similarly, Spencer et al. (2021) reviewed existing national inventories and reported a minimum-estimate of 13,400\u201315,400 active and inactive TSFs, and remarked that the true number of all existing TSFs worldwide could be in the order of ~30,000 when accounting for abandoned TSFs and poorly reported countries.\nAs such, we consider the median-derived number of 20,230 to be more representative, as it is closer to the WMTF (2020) estimate and is not likely a severe underestimate of the true number of TSFs worldwide. However, previous interpretations on the failure rates of TSFs have been based on lower-estimates of the number of TSFs worldwide (e.g. ~3500 at the turn of the century; Davies et al., 2000; Davies, 2002; Lyu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2021). In our temporal and cumulative rate analyses (Sections 5.2.1 and 5.3), we showed the results based on both our Median Extrapolation and Mean Extrapolation methods. This allowed us to illustrate the differences in the calculated TSF failure and fatality rates when adopting our lower-estimate of the number of constructed TSFs (Mean Extrapolation), as done in previous studies, versus when adopting our upper-estimate and potentially representative estimate of the \u201ctrue\u201d number of constructed TSFs (Median Extrapolation).\nWe note that, for a few commodities (gold, silver, zinc and diamond), even the median storage volumes were higher than anticipated, which resulted in underestimated numbers of TSFs for these commodities. Given that some commodities were not considered in our extrapolation (e.g. cobalt, tin, platinum), our obtained estimate of 20,230 could still be a global underestimate, but it remains difficult to confirm this. We also cannot confirm whether the numbers of TSFs corresponding to the other commodities (coal\/fly ash, iron, phosphate, lead, copper, bauxite, aluminum, nickel and uranium) are overestimates. There is also inevitable uncertainty in the multiplication factors provided in Bullock et al. (2021), especially for the four commodities that correspond to underestimated numbers of TSFs.\nA summary worksheet of our calculations and a comparison between our extrapolation estimates and the incomplete disclosure data in Franks et al. (2021) are provided in supplementary material (Rana et al., 2022).\n\n\n4.5\nTailings storage facility (TSF) failures\nTo develop an updated database of TSF failures, we first assembled all TSF and mine waste failures and relevant information that have been listed in preceding inventories (Table 3), amounting to almost 370 cases between 1915 and 2020. We shortened the inventory to 328 cases in the period 1965\u20132020. As stated in Section 3.2.2, a limitation in previous datasets is that some incidents involving other categories of mine waste (spoil tips, coarse colliery waste and waste rock dumps) were categorized as TSF failures. The present study adopts a strict definition of tailings and TSFs (Table 1) that we applied when screening the 328 cases in the period 1965\u20132020. The incident summaries and remarks given in ICOLD (2001) and Islam and Murakami (2021) supported this effort by providing case-specific context. In addition, we geo-located ~85% of the TSF failure sites, thus building on the work of Rana et al. (2021a, 2021b) and Islam and Murakami (2021). This allowed us to verify the type of mine waste site and the failure extent by examining historical remote sensing imagery, such as Corona, Landsat, USGS aerial photographs, Sentinel, SPOT (on Google Earth), RapidEye, PlanetScope and Worldview (on Google Earth) (similar to the approach of Rana et al., 2021a, 2021b).\nBased on our definition and case selection\/screening criteria, we identified 303 TSF failures that occurred in the period 1965\u20132020. This updated database is provided as supplementary data (Rana et al., 2022). The 303 TSF failures occurred across 249 distinct mine sites. Of the 303 TSF failures, we reported the geographic coordinates for 259 cases and the altitude for 215 cases. We assigned a qualitative measure of uncertainty to the reported location of each TSF: low uncertainty (high certainty that the failed TSF has been geo-located), medium uncertainty (the failed TSF is\/was in the general vicinity of the place-marked mine site but its exact location can not be identified) and high uncertainty (the failed TSF or the corresponding mine site could not be geo-located).\nWith the support of previous datasets and case history literature, we reported the dam height (158 cases), primary ore type (298 cases), total impounded volume (92 cases), total released volume (142 cases) and number of deaths (all cases). We also listed the causative variable(s) for 229 cases based on the definitions provided in Rana et al. (2021a) and the incident descriptions provided in ICOLD (2001), Bowker and Chambers (2015), Islam and Murakami (2021) and Rana et al. (2021a, 2021b).\n\nTable 5\n introduces a new three-tiered qualitative index termed Consequence Level for TSF failures. The Consequence Level helps distinguish case histories according to the inundation extent (within vs. outside the mine perimeter) and the geochemical vs. physical nature of their impacts. The Consequence Levels were assigned to 285 (out of 303) cases in the period 1965\u20132020 with sufficient information in scientific literature, news articles and satellite imagery. The process of assigning the qualitative index required some subjective interpretation and judgment.\nIt is difficult to confirm whether the 303 TSF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 is a statistically complete figure or whether more TSF failures have occurred in poorly reported regions. To qualitatively account for this uncertainty, we refer to this number (303) as the \u201creported\u201d number of TSF failures worldwide over the study period.\n\n\n\n5\nStatistical analysis\n\n5.1\nLarge reservoir facilities (LRFs)\n\n5.1.1\nTemporal characteristics\n\nFig. 3\n displays the annual and cumulative numbers and the cumulative storage capacity of newly constructed LRFs worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. There have been 33,424 constructed LRFs in this period. The number of constructed LRFs per annum has declined by over 90% since the peak during the 1970s. The total storage capacity of LRFs built in this period is about 1.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 m3 (almost the volume of Lake Superior, the world's third largest freshwater lake), with the cumulative number rising linearly since the early 1980s. Additional graphical insights on the geometric and geographic characteristics of constructed LRFs are provided in the Supplementary Article (Rana et al., 2022).\nThe number of LRF failures worldwide per annum, based on our estimates in Fig. 4\n, has declined at a rate almost proportional to the LRF construction rate. This decline can be explained by previous statistical observations that the greatest likelihood for a newly constructed reservoir facility to fail is within the first 5\u00a0years of operation (Foster et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016). Therefore, one can expect that as the rate of LRF construction declines, so will the number of LRF failures. Our Estimation Scenario 1 indicates that 394 LRF failures occurred worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020, whereas our Scenario 2 produces a higher estimate of 608 LRF failures worldwide over the same period (Fig. 4b). China accounts for 66% (Scenario 1) to 78% (Scenario 2) of LRF failures but just 42% of constructed LRFs worldwide. We observe four distinct failure periods in Fig. 4a: the peak era of LRF failures appears to end in 1965 (23 cases in Scenario 1 and 37 cases in Scenario 2); 1966 to the late 1970s (13 to 22 cases per annum in Scenario 1 and 24 to 32 cases per annum in Scenario 2); late 1970s to the turn of the century (4 to 14 cases in Scenario 1 and 7 to 17 cases in Scenario 2); and\u00a0\u2264\u00a05 events per year since then (with 0 LRF failures in 2015 and 2016). Based on our minimum-estimate data, the cumulative storage capacity of failed LRFs since 1965 is >2.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 m3, which makes up >0.2% of the cumulative storage capacity of constructed LRFs.\nThe cumulative number of fatalities caused by LRF failures over the study period is ~40,100 (Fig. 4d). Due to incomplete data, we considered only those LRF failures with a minimum death toll of 10 people. The cumulative total is a representative estimate based on our assumption of ~10,000 deaths for the 1979 Machhu disaster in India (the unofficial death toll ranges from 2500 to 15,000 in literature and news articles).\nThe histograms in Fig. 5\n show that the annual number of LRF failures worldwide over the study period was predominantly \u226410 in both Estimation Scenarios. The histograms in Figs. 5b to 5d divide the study period into four successive 14-year intervals, illustrating how the frequency of LRF failures worldwide has reduced considerably over time in both Estimation Scenarios.\n\n\n5.1.2\nMagnitude-frequency distributions\n\nFig. 6\n illustrates the magnitude-frequency profiles of LRF failures in terms of storage capacity and fatalities. In Fig. 6a, we show the cumulative storage capacity-frequency curve for only LRF failures with storage capacities of \u226510\u00a0M\u00a0m3 in the period 1965\u20132020. The reason for this is to reduce the influence and degree of data incompleteness for LRF failures. In other words, the storage capacity data is more complete (though still not fully complete) for high-magnitude LRF failures, such as those with minimum storage capacities of 10\u00a0M\u00a0m3, which allows us to generate a more representative annual frequency profile with a sufficient number of data points.\nA robust power-law relationship is observed for the 54 cases. We calculated a mean annual frequency of >0.8 for failed LRFs with storage capacities of \u226520\u00a0M\u00a0m3. This implies a mean return period (i.e. inverse of annual frequency) of <1.3\u00a0years. For failed LRFs with storage capacities of \u226550\u00a0M\u00a0m3, the mean return period is estimated to have been <2\u00a0years. In comparison, the average frequency of LRF construction worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020 was 110 per annum (one every 3\u00a0days) and 67 per annum (one every 5\u00a0days) for those with storage capacities of \u226520\u00a0M\u00a0m3 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0M\u00a0m3 respectively. We also draw attention to the 78 \u201cmega\u201d LRF projects with storage capacities of \u226550,000\u00a0M\u00a0m3 that form high-end outliers in Fig. 6a.\nGiven that the number of LRF failures markedly declined over time, we divided the cumulative frequency curves into two successive 28-year intervals in Fig. 6b. Using the power-law function corresponding to the period 1965\u20131992, the mean return periods are calculated to have been <1\u00a0year for failed LRFs with storage capacities of \u226520\u00a0M\u00a0m3 and\u00a0<\u00a01.5\u00a0years for those with storage capacities of \u226550\u00a0M\u00a0m3. In the period 1993\u20132020, the mean return periods for LRF failures decreased to <2\u00a0years (for \u226520\u00a0M\u00a0m3) and\u00a0<\u00a03\u00a0years (for \u226550\u00a0M\u00a0m3). This indicates that the recurrence rate of high-magnitude LRF failures has reduced by two-fold over time.\n\nFig. 6c plots the cumulative fatality-frequency profile for 27 LRF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 with a minimum death toll of 10 people. The mean return period for LRF failures with \u226520 deaths and\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100 deaths was ~2.5\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a05\u00a0years respectively. In Fig. 6d, we divided the study period into two time intervals (as done in Fig. 6b). In the period 1965\u20131992, the mean return period is calculated to have been ~2\u00a0years for LRF failures with \u226520 deaths and\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0years for events with \u2265100 deaths. In the period 1993\u20132020, the corresponding mean return periods reduced to ~3.5\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a014\u00a0years. This implies that the frequency of fatal LRF failures has declined over time, with the reduction factor calculated to be ~2\u00d7 for events with \u226520 deaths and\u00a0~\u00a04.5\u00d7 for events with \u2265100 deaths.\n\n\n\n5.2\nTailings storage facilities (TSFs)\n\n5.2.1\nTemporal characteristics\n\nFig. 7\n shows the results from our Median Extrapolation and Mean Extrapolation approaches to estimate the number of constructed TSFs worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. Our Median Extrapolation produces an upper-estimate that, based on our review, is closer to the representative estimate, whereas our Mean Extrapolation produces a lower-estimate that aligns with interpretations in previous studies (Sections 3.2.1 and 4.4). For comparison, we indicate by a red circle in Fig. 7b the conservative estimate of ~3500 TSFs in the year 2000 by Davies et al. (2000) and Davies (2002), which is equal to our Mean Extrapolation estimate for the same year.\nOur Median Extrapolation approach indicates that the number of TSFs constructed (or commenced) per annum has increased over time from ~150 in 1965 to ~650 in 2020, representing an increase of ~330%. In comparison, our Mean Extrapolation approach indicates a similar global rate of increase from ~50 to ~220 new TSFs per annum. The cumulative estimated number of constructed TSFs is 20,230 based on our Median Extrapolation, which is three times the Mean Extrapolation estimate of 6810. The incomplete disclosure database in Franks et al. (2021) identifies only 1336 constructed TSFs in the same period. The global volume of produced (and stored) tailings per annum has accelerated over time (Fig. 7c), with the cumulative volume estimated to be just over 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011 m3 (almost the volume of Lake Winnipeg, Canada's sixth largest freshwater lake). In comparison, the cumulative volume reported in the disclosure database in Franks et al. (2021) is 3.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 m3, which equals to 16% of our estimated total.\n\nFig. 8a shows that the global rate of reported TSF failures has remained fairly constant since 1966 (Fig. 8a). The histogram distributions of reported TSF failures in Fig. 9\n illustratively confirm this; the annual number of TSF failures worldwide is predominantly between 2 and 6 events over the study period. The peak of 21 failures in the year 1965 was largely due to the Mw 7.6 earthquake in western Chile that caused the simultaneous failures of 17 TSFs (Dobry and Alvarez, 1967; Villavicencio et al., 2014; Rana et al., 2021a, 2021b; Islam and Murakami, 2021), leading to a national ban on the upstream dam-raise method. In total, there were 303 reported TSF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 (Fig. 8c). The cumulative number of fatalities resulting from these events was 2023 (Fig. 8e). We categorized 285 of the 303 cases according to their Consequence Levels (Table 5). Of these 285 cases, 89 were of Consequence Level 1 (CL1: localized impact), 110 were of CL2 (off-site geochemical impact) and 86 were of CL3 (off-site physical and geochemical impact) (Fig. 8b). The rate of CL1 incidents declined over time, commensurate with the marginally rising rate of CL2 cases. The rate of CL3 events remained relatively constant.\nThe cumulative volume released by reported TSF failures in the period 1965\u20132020, based on minimum-estimate data (due to missing data for many CL1 cases and some CL2 cases), was >181\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (Fig. 8c). CL3 events made up ~76% of this cumulative volume. This proportion rose from 62% before the occurrences of the 2014 Mt. Polley (Canada) and 2015 Fundao (Brazil) TSF failure disasters with a combined released volume of 57\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (Morgenstern et al., 2015, 2016). CL1 events comprised a minor proportion of released volumes of reported TSF failures. We also find that the released volumes in CL3 events has increased at a greater rate compared to CL2 events, especially since 2014.\nIn Fig. 8d, we categorized 229 (out of 303) TSF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 according to their causative variables as defined in Rana et al. (2021a). We note that a complex TSF failure event may have multiple causative variables. Structural drainage issues contributed to 91 TSF failures (40%), followed by weather hazards (64 cases; 28%), seismic activity (46 cases; 20%), embankment deficiencies (44 cases; 19%) and unstable foundations (34 cases; 15%). The relative proportions of seismic activity, embankment deficiency and unstable foundation have decreased over time, likely reflecting improvements in design and practice. However, weather hazards (primarily heavy rainfall) and TSF drainage deficiencies (insufficient drainage capacity or structural collapse) remain a concern, especially when considering that these two variables can act in conjunction with exacerbating effects (Rana et al., 2021a).\nAdditional graphical insights on the geometric and geographic characteristics of constructed and failed TSFs based on the disclosure data in Franks et al. (2021) and our supplementary database are provided in our Supplementary Article (Rana et al., 2022).\n\n\n5.2.2\nMagnitude-frequency distributions\n\nFig. 10\n displays the magnitude-frequency profiles of TSF failures in the period 1965\u20132020 in terms of volume, Zone 1 inundation area (Ghahramani et al., 2020; Rana et al., 2021a, 2021b) and fatalities. We obtain a robust power-law relationship for TSF failures with released volumes of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 (Fig. 10a). The mean return periods for TSF failures with released volumes of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0M\u00a0m3 are calculated to have been ~1.5\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0years respectively. For comparison, we plotted the 5-year storage volume vs. annual frequency data for constructed TSFs from the incomplete disclosure data in Franks et al. (2021). (Note that our extrapolated estimates of constructed TSFs cannot be considered here as magnitude-frequency plots require real-world data points.) Furthermore, we manually inserted a trendline that is parallel to the one for TSF failures and that covers the straight-line portion of the 5-year storage volume data. Using this linear minimum-estimate formula, we calculated that \u22653 TSF construction projects are commenced every year with planned 5-year storage volumes of 50\u00a0M\u00a0m3. We also remark that the high-end outliers represent \u201cmega\u201d TSF projects with 5-year planned storage volumes of \u2265500\u00a0M\u00a0m3, which have been commenced at least once every ~3\u00a0years on average worldwide.\n\nFig. 10b plots the annual frequency profile for 19 tailings flows with a minimum Zone 1 inundation area of 0.5\u00a0km2. Tailings flows with Zone 1 inundation areas of \u22651 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0M\u00a0m2 occurred once every ~4\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a018\u00a0years, respectively, on average. The annual frequency of the 2015 Fundao case is overestimated by the best-fit trendline because an event of its magnitude (i.e. Zone 1 inundation area) approaches the maximum credible event.\n\nFig. 10c shows the annual frequency profile for 19 TSF failures with a minimum death toll of 10 people. The 1966 Sgorigrad case in Bulgaria, reportedly the deadliest TSF failure in history with 488 deaths, is close to the maximum credible fatal event and therefore its annual frequency is overestimated by the best-fit trendline. We calculate that tailings flows that caused \u226510 deaths and\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100 deaths occurred once every ~3\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a012\u00a0years, respectively, on average.\n\n\n\n5.3\nNormalized rates\n\nFig. 11\n plots the failure rates of LRFs and TSFs normalized by the number of constructed facilities in the period 1965\u20132020. The annual rates of LRF failures per constructed LRF generally remained below 3% in both Estimation Scenarios until 2018 (Fig. 11a), when the annual numbers of constructed LRFs dropped to a historic low. Of greater significance is Fig. 11b where we plot the cumulative number of failures normalized by cumulative number of constructed facilities. The global cumulative failure rate of LRFs ranges from ~1.2% (1 out of ~83 facilities) in Estimation Scenario 1 to ~1.8% (1 out of ~55 facilities) in Estimation Scenario 2 as of end-of-2020. Both approaches indicate that the rates have remained fairly constant since 1980, which is statistically explained by the near-proportional global decline in the number of constructed LRFs and LRF failures. We plot a separate curve in Fig. 11b for all countries except China and obtained a lower, nearly constant cumulative failure rate of \u22650.7% (1 out of \u2264143 facilities) as of end-of-2020. These estimates indicate that the failure rate of LRFs in China was anomalously high during the study period. We note that Foster et al. (2000) obtained a failure rate of 1.2% for large reservoir dams constructed up to 1986, excluding China. In Fig. 11b, our corresponding estimate is \u22650.7%. This discrepancy may be due to the differences in statistical approaches (see Section 4.1) and underlying uncertainties, and\/or may confirm that our rates are indeed minimum-estimates.\nThe annual rates of TSF failures per constructed TSF vary widely depending on the extrapolation method (Fig. 11a). In both the Median Extrapolation and Mean Extrapolation approaches, the peak annual rates occur in 1965, which marked a record year of TSF failures. After 1965, the Median Extrapolation approach leads to annual rates that do not exceed 5% whereas the Mean Extrapolation produces rates as high as 14%. Fig. 11b shows that, in contrast to LRFs, the cumulative failure rate of TSFs declined over time. This is explained by the rising rate of constructed TSFs and the fairly constant rate of TSF failures over time worldwide. The Median Extrapolation (which represents our upper-estimate and potentially representative estimate of the number of constructed TSFs) indicates that the cumulative failure rate declined from over 3% before 1980 to ~1.5% (1 out of ~67 facilities) as of end-of-2020. In comparison, our Mean Extrapolation (which represents our lower-estimate of the number of constructed TSFs) illustrates a decline from over 9% before 1980 to ~4.4% (1 out of ~23 facilities) as of end-of-2020. If one assumes the conservative estimate of ~3500 TSFs in the year 2000 by Davies et al. (2000), Davies (2002) and our Mean Extrapolation approach, a cumulative failure rate of ~6.5% is obtained as of that year.\n\nFig. 12a shows the ratios (as %) of cumulative storage capacities of failed vs. constructed LRFs in the period 1965\u20132020. The record for storage capacities of failed LRFs is incomplete and therefore represents a minimum-estimate. The observed \u201cspikes\u201d in the graph correspond to failures of LRFs with very high storage capacities, such as 1975 Banqiao and Shimantan in China (combined total of 586.4\u00a0M\u00a0m3), 1981 San Luis in USA (3083\u00a0M\u00a0m3), 1982 Hinds Lake in Canada (7500\u00a0M\u00a0m3), 2017 Oroville in USA (4400\u00a0M\u00a0m3), 2018 Swar in Myanmar (266.8\u00a0M\u00a0m3), 2018 Xe-Pian in Laos (385\u00a0M\u00a0m3) and 2020 Sardoba in Uzbekistan (922\u00a0M\u00a0m3). As of end-of-2020, the cumulative storage capacity ratio of failed versus constructed LRFs is >0.21%, which represents a peak in the study period. This indicates that, since 2016, the cumulative storage capacity of newly constructed LRFs has increased at a slower rate than that of LRF failures with very high storage capacities (>200\u00a0M\u00a0m3), thus causing the recent spike. Due to lack of data on released volumes, it is difficult to estimate the percentage of the cumulative storage capacity of failed LRFs that has manifested as downstream floods.\n\nFig. 12b plots the ratios (as %) of cumulative released volumes from failed TSFs (minimum-estimate due to missing data for many CL1 cases and some CL2 cases) and the cumulative produced volumes of tailings worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. As of end-of-2020, the percentage of produced tailings that have failed is ~0.07%. The occurrences of the 2014 Mt. Polley (25\u00a0M\u00a0m3) and 2015 Fundao (32\u00a0M\u00a0m3) disasters triggered a notable increase in the cumulative ratio by about 0.03%.\n\nFig. 13\n illustrates the cumulative fatality rates of LRFs and TSFs normalized by the cumulative number of failures (Fig. 13a) and the cumulative number of constructed facilities (Fig. 13b) worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. The rates have declined and stabilized over time for both types of engineered impoundments. For LRFs, the rate was at its peak in the 1970s due to the 1975 Banqiao and Shimantan (China) and 1979 Machhu (India) disasters that collectively led to over 35,000 deaths (note that the unofficial death toll for Machhu ranges from 2500 to 15,000 in literature, and we assumed a representative estimate of ~10,000). As of end-of-2020, the fatality rate for LRFs is 1.2 deaths per constructed LRF (Fig. 13a). When normalized by cumulative LRF failures, as of end-of-2020, our Estimation Scenario 1 indicates a fatality rate of 98 deaths per failure, whereas in Estimation Scenario 2, the rate drops to 64 deaths per failure (Fig. 13b).\nThe cumulative fatality rates for TSFs are much lower than those of LRFs. As of end-of-2020, the Median Extrapolation yields a rate of 0.1 death per constructed TSF, whereas the Mean Extrapolation indicates a corresponding rate of 0.3 (Fig. 13a). When normalized by cumulative TSF failures, the rate has remained relatively constant at 6 deaths per failure (Fig. 13b).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nImplications\nOur comprehensive study produces key insights into the historical hazard-risk of engineered impoundments worldwide. LRFs and TSFs are two distinct engineering systems with different characteristics and design criteria. This corresponds to a notable difference in their statistical properties, particularly as it relates to the temporal changes in their cumulative construction, failure and fatality rates, their relationships with facility age and the geographic distribution of their failure occurrences.\nYet, our study also indicates an important statistical similarity between LRFs and TSFs: their global cumulative failure rates appear to be in the same order if we adopt the Median Extrapolation approach as a representative estimate of the number of constructed TSFs. This observation holds true in both Estimation Scenarios for LRF failures. This contradicts previous interpretations that the failure rate of TSFs is more than two orders of magnitude greater than water-retention dams (Azam and Li, 2010) or that the likelihood of TSF failures is several times higher than water-retention dams (Lyu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2021). Our review and findings suggest that these previous interpretations were based on lower-estimates of the number of TSFs worldwide (e.g. ~3500 at the turn of this century; Davies et al., 2000; Davies, 2002; Lyu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2021), the missing historical data on water-retention dam failures in China, and the unknown number of water-retention dams worldwide. Based on our examination of existing records and estimates (see Section 3.2.1), we find that the \u201ctrue\u201d number of constructed TSFs worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020 is much closer to 20,230 (Median Extrapolation) than it is to 6810 (Mean Extrapolation). This implies that the \u201ctrue\u201d global cumulative failure rate of TSFs is much lower than 4.4% (derived from Mean Extrapolation) and closer to 1.5% (derived from Median Extrapolation). In comparison, our results indicate that the \u201ctrue\u201d global cumulative failure rate of LRFs likely falls in the range of 1.2% to 1.8%. This finding has important implications in how researchers and practitioners perceive the global risk of TSFs \u2013 especially when comparing to that of water-retention dams \u2013 and in the underlying assumptions when undertaking hazard-risk assessments.\nMoreover, we find that the cumulative failure rate of an engineered structure is not necessarily a constant number, but rather may evolve through time. This observation is particularly relevant to TSFs, which have experienced a steady decline in cumulative failure rate over the study period based on both our Median Extrapolation and Mean Extrapolation estimates.\n\n6.1.1\nFailures of large reservoir facilities (LRFs)\nThe frequency of LRF failures has significantly reduced over the study period, which may reflect global-scale improvements in LRF design and operation. We also observe that the global rate of LRF failures is correlated to the global rate of LRF construction. The greatest statistical likelihood for a reservoir facility to fail is between the time of first filling and the 5th year of operation, after which the likelihood generally declines over time (Foster et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016). This may partly explain the observed constant cumulative failure rate for LRFs. Despite this, major failures of LRFs with very high storage capacities (>200\u00a0M\u00a0m3) have continued to occur since 2016. Although data on causative variables is sparse, our supplementary database of LRF failures indicates that the majority of LRF failures since 2002 (at least 11 of 19 events, or\u00a0\u2265\u00a058%) have been associated with heavy rainfall (Rana et al., 2022). Heavy rainfall-induced failures of LRFs are predominantly manifested through overtopping or internal erosion of the dam. This has important implications for the design of storage capacity, freeboard and spillways under conditions of climate change.\nWe further note that in the period 1965\u20132020, China had 66% (Estimation Scenario 1) to 78% (Estimation Scenario 2) of LRF failures but just 42% of constructed LRFs worldwide. The USA had 14% (Estimation Scenario 2) to 21% (Estimation Scenario 1) of LRF failures and 12% of constructed LRFs worldwide. This implies the global hazard-risk of LRF failures was geographically concentrated in these two particular nations over the study period.\n\n\n6.1.2\nFailures of tailings storage facilities (TSFs)\nIn contrast to LRFs, there is no obvious correlation between facility age and failure likelihood in the case of TSFs, whereby even inactive or closed TSFs may possess an appreciable probability of failing several decades after commencement (e.g. Santamarina et al., 2019; Islam and Murakami, 2021). This is due to the inherent properties of TSFs: (i) hydraulically discharged tailings are predisposed to attain a sensitive, metastable state if drainage is not well-controlled in the facility, regardless of the age of the TSF (e.g. Morgenstern et al., 2016; Robertson et al., 2019); and (ii) TSFs are progressively built up over time, thus they continue to gain mass\/energy during the operational stage, and they remain in a dynamic state until after closure.\nThis long-term engineering challenge can be further complicated by regional-scale intensifying rainfall patterns. For example, the sudden static liquefaction failure of the inactive Feijao TSF in 2019 in Brazil was preconditioned by higher-than-average rainfall over the preceding wet season, which led to the loss of suction strength (negative pore pressures) in previously unsaturated tailings (Robertson et al., 2019). On a global scale, structural drainage deficiencies and weather hazards (which can often act in conjunction with exacerbating effects; Rana et al., 2021a) are the two most dominant causative variables for TSF failures (Fig. 8d). Therefore, similar to LRFs, the design and management of TSF drainage systems with the consideration of long-term, regional-scale precipitation patterns will be an important issue to address under conditions of climate change. Some studies have already drawn attention to the portfolio-scale, aggregate risk of hydroclimatic extremes in the global mining industry (e.g. Bonnafous et al., 2017; Bonnafous and Lall, 2021).\nThe annual number of TSF failures worldwide has stayed relatively constant and not declined (on average) since 1966. However, our estimates suggest that the number of constructed TSFs worldwide has increased over time, which has translated into a declining cumulative failure rate. Compared to LRF failures, TSF failures are more geographically well-distributed worldwide (e.g. Figs. S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Article; Rana et al., 2022). Our supplementary data and article (Fig. S15; Rana et al., 2022) show a marked decrease in the frequency of TSF failures in the USA and Chile. The decrease in Chile is attributed to the national ban on the upstream-raise method in 1970 (Villavicencio et al., 2014). We also showed that the proportional contributions of seismic activity, embankment deficiency and unstable foundation as causative variables for TSF failures have declined over time worldwide.\nYet, we also observed that the global average released volume from failed TSFs has risen, primarily due to 3 catastrophic events since 2014 (2014 Mt. Polley, 2015 Feijao and 2019 Feijao). This increase is nearly proportional to the estimated increase in global tailings production volumes (see Fig. 12 that shows a fairly constant cumulative ratio of 0.5\u20130.8% over the past few decades). Furthermore, although CL2 and CL3 events continue to occur at similar rates, the released volumes in CL3 events has been increasing at a greater rate, especially since 2014 (Fig. 8b and c). This implies that the environmental impact due to TSF failures has increased on average.\n\n\n6.1.3\nGlobal FN and environmental risk\nAnother key insight in this study is that the global cumulative fatality rate has declined for both LRFs and TSFs between 1965 and 2020 \u2013 a period during which the global population increased by 130%. This observation is consistent irrespective of whether the fatality data is normalized by the number of constructed facilities or by the number of failures. We attribute this finding to systematic, incremental improvements in dam safety programs and risk assessment and management frameworks for both dam engineering sectors.\nThe fatality rates for LRFs are much higher than those for TSFs, which we attribute to the following three factors. First, LRFs are typically located closer to populated areas due to societal benefits (e.g. agricultural, hydroelectric and recreation reservoirs), whereas many mine sites are located farther away from residential areas. Second, for a given volume, the inundation extent of water floods from failed LRFs exceeds that of tailings flows which typically have significant sediment content. Lastly, on average, LRFs have larger storage capacities and tend to release a greater proportion of impounded contents relative to TSFs.\nTo contextualize our cumulative fatality-frequency results, we plot in Fig. 14\n the best-fit regression lines corresponding to LRF failures in 1965\u20131992 and 1993\u20132020 (Fig. 6d) and TSF failures in 1965\u20132020 (Fig. 10c) on an FN diagram, which is commonly used as a framework for societal risk assessment for natural and engineering hazards (e.g. Baecher and Christian, 2003; DeNeale et al., 2019; Strouth and McDougall, 2021). FN curves display the annual frequency (or annual probability), F, of N or more fatalities in log-log space. LRF failures have experienced a drop in their global FN risk between the periods 1965\u20131992 and 1993\u20132020, which now appears to be comparable to that of TSF failures. The difference in the best-fit regression slopes of the LRF (1993\u20132020) and TSF curves implies the following: (i) the annual frequencies of LRF failures that resulted in \u226510 to \u226520 deaths are slightly higher than those of TSF failures that caused \u226510 to \u226520 deaths; (ii) the annual frequencies of LRF failures with \u226530 to \u226580 deaths are comparable to those of TSF failures that caused \u226530 to \u226580 deaths; and (iii) the annual frequencies of TSF failures that caused 100 or more deaths slightly exceed those of LRF failures that resulted in 100 or more deaths.\nWe choose not to include in Fig. 14 the societal risk acceptability criteria set by several studies and regulatory agencies for natural and engineering hazards (e.g. Versteeg, 1988; ANCOLD, 1994; GEO, 1998; Baecher and Christian, 2003; CDA, 2013; Briaud, 2020) due to the following issues: (i) each of the \u201cUnacceptable\u201d guidelines reflects the tolerable risk thresholds and policy decisions that are subjectively set by the specific author\/regulator; (ii) the FN societal risk acceptability criteria and analyses are more appropriate and representative in site-scale to regional-scale (rather than global-scale) risk studies; and (iii) while site-scale risks can each be acceptable under a guideline, probabilistically combining the site-scale risks may lead to unacceptability in an FN chart, which can lead to inconsistent interpretation (Baecher and Christian, 2003). Due to these reasons, the guidance derived from FN acceptability criteria is typically viewed as qualitative in conventional geotechnical practice (Baecher and Christian, 2003).\nWith respect to environmental risk, a key difference between LRF and TSF failures is the long-term fate and extreme geochemical consequences associated with downstream tailings flow deposits. Contaminant products from heavy metals and sulfides in released tailings, which are sometimes mixed with highly acidic or alkaline wastewater, can persist in the impacted environment and ecosystem for several years to decades, even after mechanical removal of the waste (e.g. Macklin et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005; Kraus and Wiegand, 2006; Kossoff et al., 2014; Gabriel et al., 2021). Tailings flows belonging to the categories CL2 and especially CL3 typically pollute surface water bodies (resulting in loss of inclusive biota), groundwater, riparian soils and vegetation, forestry and\/or agricultural resources. Hazardous air quality (suspended tailings dust) in the aftermath of CL3 tailings flows is also a source of long-term health concerns to local populations and can impede disaster relief efforts (e.g. Galv\u00e3o et al., 2020). As a result, post-failure clean-up, remediation and restoration project timelines and costs can be much greater than initially budgeted for, with major implications for the regional or national economy (e.g. Bowker and Chambers, 2015, 2017). Such events can also lead to large-scale displacement of affected communities due to the degraded quality of essential needs (e.g. water, food and air) and the loss of livelihoods (e.g. Amnesty International, 2017; Milanez et al., 2021). Table 5 and Fig. 8b showed that 196 of 285 (~69%) TSF failures in the study period were assigned as either CL2 or CL3. This indicates that 3\u20134 TSF failures occur every year worldwide on average that result in reported downstream geochemical consequences.\nIn summary, although both LRF and TSF failures can produce physically destructive mass flows, the geochemical fate of tailings flows is of special concern as it relates to environmental risk. We note that this discussion ignores the local-scale environmental hazards that can result from the mere presence (not just failures) of some large TSFs (e.g. Dong et al., 2020; Okereafor et al., 2020). This has implications for the long-term sustainability of legacy TSFs given our observations of the increased global rate of tailings production and TSF construction over the study period (Fig. 7), and keeping in mind that a significant proportion of TSFs worldwide have yet to undergo closure or decommissioning.\n\n\n6.1.4\nCharacterizing the \u201cglobal safety\u201d of LRFs and TSFs\nAll of the findings in this study raise an important question: which of our numerous statistical results should define the \u201cglobal safety\u201d of LRFs and TSFs? Ultimately, the conversation on the \u201cglobal safety\u201d of either type of facility should incorporate all of these nuances and should not be narrowed down to a singular parameter or number. In this regard, we draw the following summary conclusions:\n\n\u2022\nThe annual numbers of constructed and failed LRFs have declined almost proportionally, thus the global cumulative failure rate of LRFs has stayed nearly constant. The \u201ctrue\u201d rate likely falls in the range of 1.2% to 1.8% as of end-of-2020 based on our two estimation approaches. The rate drops to at least 0.7% as of end-of-2020 if China is excluded. The global cumulative fatality rate of LRFs has reduced over time to 1.2 deaths per constructed facility, and falls within the range of 64 to 98 deaths per failure based on our estimates, as of end-of-2020. However, major failures of LRFs with very high storage capacities (>200\u00a0M\u00a0m3) have continued to occur since 2016.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe annual number of TSF failures has stayed relatively constant, whereas the annual construction rate of TSFs has increased over the study period, thus the global cumulative failure rate of TSFs has declined over time. When assuming our lower-estimate of the number of constructed TSFs between 1965 and 2020, we obtain a cumulative failure rate of ~4.4% as of end-of-2020. Adopting our higher-estimate yields a rate of ~1.5% as of end-of-2020, which falls in the same order as the corresponding rate of LRFs. Our review of published estimates and figures of the \u201ctrue\u201d number of existing TSFs worldwide indicates that the \u201ctrue\u201d cumulative failure rate is much lower than 4.4% and closer to 1.5%. The cumulative fatality rate of TSF failures has reduced over time to 0.1\u20130.3 death per constructed facility and 6 deaths per failure as of end-of-2020; these rates are lower than the corresponding rates of LRFs. However, the size and the environmental impact of TSF failures have both increased on average, especially since 2014. The increased global rate of failed tailings volumes is roughly proportional to the increased rate of global tailings production since the 1990s.\n\n\n\u2022\nHeavy rainfall events and intensifying precipitation patterns are statistically important causative variables for the failures of both LRFs and TSFs. This has implications for the design and management of storage capacity, freeboard, facility drainage and spillways under climate change conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2\nUncertainties, assumptions and limitations\nThe results presented in this study are applicable broadly on a global scale, having been conditioned by uncertainties in the data and the methods used to address data gaps. Methodological details of our estimation and extrapolation approaches are provided in Section 4 and the supplementary information (Rana et al., 2022). To improve the robustness of future statistical analyses, a more comprehensive public disclosure effort is necessary, particularly with respect to reservoir facility failures in China and constructed TSFs worldwide.\nWe summarize below the most important sources of uncertainties in our statistical methods and, to avoid repetition, refer to the original sections where the basis and implications of these uncertainties are discussed:\n\n\u2022\nFocusing our statistical analysis to a specific study period (Section 4.1);\n\n\n\u2022\nThe missing storage capacity data, and the resulting minimum-estimate, of the number of LRF failures worldwide except China over the study period (Section 4.3.1);\n\n\n\u2022\nAdopting two statistical estimation scenarios to approximate the number of LRF failures in China and subsequently worldwide over the study period (Section 4.3.2); and\n\n\n\u2022\nAdopting two statistical extrapolation approaches to estimate the volume of produced (stored) tailings and the number of constructed TSFs worldwide over the study period (Section 4.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nSummary and conclusions\nThe failures of engineered dams that retain freshwater or mining waste (tailings) have led to major socioeconomic and environmental consequences. However, the global, historical magnitude-frequency statistics of these occurrences have remained poorly quantified, out-of-date and\/or limited in scope. In this study, we presented an analysis of new datasets and estimates of the construction and failures of large reservoir facilities (LRFs) and tailings storage facilities (TSFs) worldwide in the 56-year study period of 1965\u20132020. We addressed long-standing data gaps on LRF failures in China, and subsequently worldwide, and on constructed TSFs worldwide by adopting multiple estimation approaches for each variable in an effort to illustrate the range of uncertainty in our results. By addressing these gaps, we generated insights into how the hazard-risk of large water-retention dams and mine tailings impoundments has evolved over time. Additional databases, key insights, and methodological details on our estimation methods are provided as supplementary information (Rana et al., 2022).\nRegarding LRFs, we observed the following global-scale statistics:\n\n1.\nThe total number of LRF failures worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020 was estimated to be in the range of 394 to 608. Between 66% and 78% of these failures occurred in China and between 14% and 21% occurred in the USA, which implies a geographic concentration of LRF hazard-risk in these two nations.\n\n\n2.\nThe annual rate of construction and failures have decreased almost proportionally over the study period, which translates into a nearly constant cumulative failure rate that likely falls within the range of 1.2% to 1.8% as of end-of-2020. This figure drops to a nearly constant rate of \u22650.7% when China is excluded.\n\n\n3.\nThe mean return period of failures increased from <1\u00a0year in the period 1965\u20131992 to <2\u00a0years in the period 1993\u20132020 for LRFs with storage capacities of \u226520\u00a0M\u00a0m3. Similarly, the mean return period increased from <1.5\u00a0years (1965\u20131992) to <3\u00a0years (1993\u20132020) for LRF failures with storage capacities of \u226550\u00a0M\u00a0m3. This implies that the recurrence rate of high-magnitude failures of LRFs reduced by two-fold over the study period.\n\n\n4.\nThe mean return period increased from ~2\u00a0years to ~3.5\u00a0years for LRF failures with \u226520 deaths and from ~3\u00a0years to ~14\u00a0years for events with \u2265100 deaths. This indicates that the reduction factor for the number of fatal failures over time was ~2\u00d7 for LRF failures with \u226520 deaths and\u00a0~\u00a04.5\u00d7 for failures with \u2265100 deaths.\n\n\n5.\nThe ratio of cumulative storage capacities of failed LRFs per constructed LRFs was >0.21% as of end-of-2020. This represents a peak in the study period as, since 2016, the cumulative storage capacity of newly constructed LRFs has increased at a slower rate than that of failed LRFs with very high storage capacities (>200\u00a0M\u00a0m3).\n\n\n6.\nThe cumulative fatality rates were 1.2 deaths per constructed LRF, and fell within the range of 64 to 98 deaths per LRF failure based on our estimates, as of end-of-2020.\n\n\n7.\nAlthough data on causative variables is scarce, our supplementary database of LRF failures indicates that at least 11 of 19 cases (\u226558%) since 2002 were associated with heavy rainfall.\n\n\n\nRegarding TSFs, we observed the following global-scale statistics:\n\n1.\nBy extrapolation from mineral commodity production data, we obtained a lower-estimate of 6810 TSFs and an upper-estimate of 20,230 TSFs that have been constructed worldwide in the period 1965\u20132020. Both estimates indicated that the annual number of constructed TSFs increased by ~3\u00d7 over this period. However, the annual number of TSF failures worldwide remained fairly constant, thus the cumulative failure rate declined over time. When assuming our lower-estimate of the number of constructed TSFs, the cumulative failure rate is estimated to be ~4.4% as of end-of-2020. When adopting our upper-estimate, the rate is ~1.5% as of end-of-2020, which falls in the same order as the corresponding rate of LRFs. Our review of published estimates indicates that the \u201ctrue\u201d number of constructed TSFs over the study period is much higher than our lower-estimate (6810) and closer to our upper-estimate (20,230). This implies that the \u201ctrue\u201d cumulative failure rate is much lower than 4.4% and closer to 1.5%.\n\n\n2.\nTSF failures with released volumes of \u22651\u00a0M\u00a0m3 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a05\u00a0M\u00a0m3 occurred once every ~1.5\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0years, respectively, on average.\n\n\n3.\nTailings flows with primary impact zone (Zone 1) inundation areas of \u22651 and\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0km2 occurred once every ~4\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a018\u00a0years, respectively, on average.\n\n\n4.\nTSF failures with \u226510 deaths and\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100 deaths occurred once every ~3\u00a0years and\u00a0~\u00a012\u00a0years, respectively, on average.\n\n\n5.\nThe proportional contributions of structural drainage deficiency and weather hazards as causative variables of TSF failures have increased, whereas that of seismic activity, embankment deficiency and unstable foundation has decreased.\n\n\n6.\nThe percentage of produced tailings that have failed is ~0.07% as of end-of-2020 and the cumulative ratio has remained fairly constant since the 1990s. The global average released volume from failed TSFs has risen at a rate roughly proportional to the estimated increase in the global rate of produced tailings.

The cumulative fatality rate of LRF failures has reduced over time. However, major failures of LRFs with very high storage capacities have continued to occur.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe annual number of TSF failures has stayed relatively constant whereas the annual construction rate of TSFs has increased, thus the cumulative failure rate of TSFs has continued to decline and, based on our review and analysis, may fall in the same order as the rate of LRFs. The cumulative fatality rate of TSF failures has reduced over time and is lower than the corresponding rate of LRFs. However, the size and the environmental impact of TSF failures have increased on average worldwide at a rate approximately proportional to the increased global rate of tailings production.\n\n\n\u2022\nHeavy rainfall events and intensifying precipitation patterns are statistically important causative variables for the failures of both LRFs and TSFs. This has implications for the design and management of storage capacity, freeboard, facility drainage and spillways under climate change conditions.\n\n\n\nOur results serve as quantitative benchmarks for estimating likelihoods of facility failures and their societal impacts to support future risk assessments. These results are applicable broadly on a global scale, having been conditioned by uncertainties in the data and the methods\/approaches used to address existing data gaps. To improve the robustness of future statistical analyses, a more comprehensive public disclosure effort is necessary, particularly with respect to reservoir facility failures in China and constructed TSFs worldwide.\n\n\nData availability\nSupplementary materials to this article are published in the following Borealis data repository (Rana et al., 2022): https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5683\/SP3\/K7SANT\n\n\n","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThere is continued interest in using soil and the deeper soil parent material (SPM) resource to increase soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration (Minasny et al., 2017), based partly on effective mechanisms recognized in the long-term burial and sequestration of soil organic carbon (OC) by externally transported material (Chaopricha and Marin-Spiotta, 2014; Hoffmann et al., 2013; D'Elia et al., 2017). Whilst results from long-term experiments have identified possible limitations regarding increasing OC storage in top-soil (Poulton et al., 2018), potential remains for increasing OC storage in the sub- (~1\u00a0m) and deeper (> 1\u00a0m) parts of the SPM profile (Lorenz and Lal, 2005), where substantial quantities of minerals (e.g. iron oxides, clays) that are important as OC stabilisers exist (Whitmore et al., 2015). Suggested emplacement methods of OC into these subsoil horizons have included utilising natural processes such as DOC leaching (Whitmore et al., 2015), breeding plants with deeper rooting systems (Mikutta et al., 2006) or the injection of pelletized organic matter (Leskiw and Welsh, 2012). Paustian et al. (2019) describe these and other possibilities as \u2018frontier technologies\u2019 for which significant economic and technological barriers still exist, and for which further research and incentivization are required. However, complications exist regarding the possible re-incorporation of buried carbon into the global C cycle. The potential \u2018priming\u2019 of existing buried carbon leading to changes in SOM decomposition, through addition of labile C and nutrients, has been recognized in both terrestrial and aquatic environments (Bianchi and Ward, 2019; Kayler et al., 2019), and with changes in land-use or agricultural practice (Fontaine et al., 2007). In addition, erosion or excavation processes may translocate buried carbon towards the soil surface where oxidation is more likely.\nGiven the urgency to abate climate change, it is important that research considers how to maximise OC storage and sequestration potential, whilst ensuring that OC storage mechanisms are protected against, and resilient to, perturbation. The first stages in this effort are to establish where, and how much, buried OC exists, the processes that led to its burial, and the mechanisms that have hitherto protected it against mineralization. By doing so, effective national strategies for using SPM for OC sequestration may be developed. Such effort has not enjoyed much scholarly attention in the past. This gap is addressed here by reviewing the role of soil\/sediment erosion and deposition since the UK Last Glacial Maximum (UK-LGM; MIS 2), which has led to OC burial. The UK-LGM represents the most recent event where a widespread natural perturbation of the landscape occurred.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nThis review aims to use spatial knowledge of sediment deposited since the UK-LGM along with knowledge of OC concentrations to produce an overview of buried OC within the UK. The periods of interest are the Chronostratigraphic Stages (Global Quaternary timescale) of Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 and 1. MIS 2, often referred to as the Late Devensian in the UK is the period between ~29 and 11.7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, whilst MIS 1 is known as the Holocene and covers the period ~11.7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP to present. Within MIS 2 is the UK-LGM which has been estimated at ~27\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, and represents the period of maximum ice sheet expansion in Britain and Ireland (Clark et al., 2012). The biostratigraphic terms for Interstadials (warm) and Stadials (cold) during MIS 2 are also used. These include the Oldest (~18.5\u201315\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, Older (~14\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) and Younger Dryas (~12.9\u201311.7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) stadials and the B\u00f8lling and Aller\u00f8d interstadials. For the purposes of published geological maps, the British Geological Survey has historically used the term Devensian to cover the time interval that incorporates the Late Devensian. Information comes from geological and soil surveying, geomorphological interpretation associated with landscape development, and archaeological studies where dating (\n14\nC or OSL) of deposited sediments has taken place. Collating this information from spatially local studies, a chronology can be established of the interactions between climate events and human impacts that produce both SPM deposits and buried OC. Typically, the magnitude of these erosion and depositional events are largely reported as thicknesses in borehole logs, and these can be unrepresentative of wider areas, as they often represent only a specific site of interest. The use of 3D geological models allow estimations of deposit thickness over wider areas (Brown, 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2007). Thus, a novel aspect of this review is the use of regional 3D geological models (1:50000) to estimate mean deposit thickness within landscapes by combining estimates of area and volume (see Supplementary Information A). Data from regional 3D models are complemented with outputs from two high-resolution 3D models of the near surface environment. These models were produced for Talla, Scotland; a landscape within the areal extent of the UK-LGM and typical of Southern Uplands terrain (Scheib et al., 2008), and at Shelford, England; a landscape positioned south of this extent (Tye et al., 2011). The locations of these 3D models are shown in Supplementary Information B. In addition, published data from the Soil Survey of England and Wales are used, along with field data collected during the production of the high-resolution 3D models, to identify concentrations of OC in SPM, namely the \u2018C' soil horizon.\nTo demonstrate the importance of erosion processes and the potential extent of OC burial that may result, data collated from the review (e.g. deposit thickness, deposit area, Total OC concentrations) were used to produce \u2018first order' estimates of the mass of organic carbon stored within three of the deposit types examined as sufficient data was available. Monte-Carlo simulations were undertaken in the statistical package \u2018R' to produce cumulative distribution functions and results presented as box plots. The \u2018runif\u2019 command was used to select values from within a defined range, since the \u2018rnorm\u2019 function requires a meaningful standard deviation which the limited data collated could not provide. Selected distributions of data were tested for normality after the simulation was run 100,000 times. Results are presented in MT organic carbon.\n\n\n3\nConceptual approach\nSediment deposition is identified in soil development models, particularly those involving slopes, such as catena classification (Sommer and Schlichting, 1997), Butler's K cycle concept (Butler, 1982) or soil-landscape chronograms (Vreeken, 1984). The resulting spatial distribution of SPM, along with properties such as thickness and texture, are fundamental in defining how pre-existing OC, along with that present in the transported material, is buried and undergoes long term sequestration. Within the UK, the redistribution of sediment to form SPM and buried OC is linked to a wide range of climate related geomorphological processes operating over different temporal and spatial scales, in addition to later anthropogenic interventions. However, the redistribution events following the UK-LGM must also be placed in the context of a much longer time series of re-distributional events, particularly previous glaciations (Clayton, 2000; Bridgland et al., 2004). Geomorphological controls which result in depositional SPM generation and OC burial include (i) Quaternary controls associated with the retreat of the British and Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and the associated Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) and Relative Sea Level (RSL) change which determines slope adjustment (Shennan and Horton, 2002); (ii) the distribution of geology within the UK including its strength, and; (iii) sediment availability.\nThe main conceptual approach of this synthesis is based on the Climate-Vegetation-Erosion (C-V-E) hypothesis, which is used as a framework to estimate the age of buried OC within the landscape. Vandenberghe (2002) suggested a coupled role between vegetation and erosion, driven by climate, whilst Dosseto et al. (2010) expanded this hypothesis, suggesting that the climatic influence on erosion over glacial cycles is indirect, and instead operates largely through amplifying erosion when vegetation cover diminishes in periods of climate deterioration. Thus, vegetation acts to bind the soil\/sediment surface, reduce the impact of rainfall intensity, provides an evapotranspiration pathway that reduces soil moisture and pore water pressure, and increases the infiltration of precipitation. In addition, Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is likely to decrease during long climate cooling phases, thus impacting the role OC has on soil structure. Therefore, the C-V-E hypothesis suggests that erosion will correspond to both regular interglacial and glacial cycles (Milankovitch-scale), and shorter-term, often more abrupt (sub-Milankovitch), cycles that impact on a regional basis.\nIn this review, the C-V-E hypothesis is extended to assess the impact of Holocene climate events, and inevitably, how interactions with anthropogenic activity increase the frequency and magnitude of these events, leaving identifiable signatures of erosion and OC burial. In recent years, climate cycles have been elucidated using the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) (Johnsen et al., 2001; Rasmussen et al., 2006). These reveal a complex pattern of cooling and warming phases within broader Milankovitch glacial cycles. Thus, sub-Milankovitch cycles such as cooling (Heinrich) events (stadials) (Oldest Dryas (GS-2a), Older Dryas and Younger Dryas (GS-1),) and warming interstadials including the B\u00f8lling (GIS-1e) and Aller\u00f8d (GIS1abcd) events have been identified (see Table 1\n). In the Holocene, smaller cooling (Bond) events have been identified, occurring at ~11.1, 9.4, 8.2, 5.9, 4.2, 2.8, 1.4, 0.5\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP. These are millennial scale cycles in the north Atlantic typified by cooling temperatures (Bond et al., 1999). There is considerable variability in the strength of these climate fluctuations and the subsequent responses. For example, most Bond events do not have a clear climate signal (only the 8.2\u00a0k\u00a0yr event has a clear cooling signal in the GRIP analysis). However, the cooling of sea surface temperatures in connection with these ice rafting events are thought to impact on global climate patterns due to disruptions in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (Bond et al., 1999). These events vary globally, some corresponding to cooling periods, others coincident with aridification particularly at lower latitudes (Smith et al., 2016). A recent study by Dreibodt et al. (2020) has demonstrated how increased soil erosion may be coincident with some of these climate deteriorations in Eastern Europe. There are also centennial and decadal processes, driven by solar or volcanic forcing, which interact with oceanic and atmospheric processes to induce changes in climate. Evidence of solar forcing events in the mid- to late Holocene is spatially variable. In the UK, these effects appear less pronounced when compared to those at higher latitudes, where insolation forced change is weaker (Charman, 2010).\nFurther centennial climate events identified that may influence erosion and buried OC include a series of what were initially termed \u2018fluvial events\u2019 (e.g. Tipping, 1995a, 1995b). Information regarding these changes in the UK and Irish climate during the Holocene were obtained from reconstructions of surface wetness in Ombrotrophic mires (Plunkett and Swindles, 2008). These studies provide evidence of a series of changes in the precipitation-evaporation balances in northern UK (Charman et al., 2006; Charman, 2010). The number of these events identified, and which in this paper are referred to as \u2018flooding events\u2019, has increased. Benito et al. (2015) carried out a global meta-analysis of >2000 radio-metrically dated flood units, and results indicated that the UK may have experienced up to 16 episodes of increased flooding, since 10,700\u00a0cal. yr BP and these are outlined in Table 5. After 5000\u00a0cal. yr BP a general increase in flood frequency was found, likely caused by a weakening in zonal circulation and an increase in winter insolation. In the UK (and central Europe) \u2018flooding events\u2019 were multi-centennial and some corresponded with periods of minimum solar irradiance. These meta-analysis investigations are based on cumulative probability functions using 14C dates and so, in the context of this study, provide an estimate of periods when there was potential for increased soil erosion and OC burial.\nWith respect to anthropogenic influence on erosion, the UK has a reasonably well documented narrative, particularly linked to land-use change (e.g. deforestation cycles). These started at the Mesolithic (hunter-gatherer)-Neolithic (cereal-livestock agriculture) transition (Whittle et al., 2011) and were identified through the decline of Lime (Tilia) pollen (Grant et al., 2011). Deforestation spread from southern England northwards (Woodbridge et al., 2014; Coombes et al., 2009; Mackay and Tallis, 1994) often in cycles of deforestation and abandonment as populations grew and declined (Dumayne, 1993) or land became exhausted (Tye et al., 2013). This is consistent with observations made across north western Europe (Fuchs et al., 2004; Starkel, 2005a; Starkel, 2005b). Importantly, Bocquet-Appel et al. (2012) suggested that the major driver on the rate of expansion of agriculture in Europe was soil fertility. Less fertile land, which is often lighter textured and more erodible, was exploited and vacated rapidly, whereas fertile land was able to support a population for longer before exhaustion.\nDefining the exact nature and concentrations of OC in deposits formed from erosion and deposition processes is difficult because of the potential leakage and mixing of OC of different ages during later development of soil profiles in the deposited material. However, on a \u2018first order' basis the following definitions are used. Two classes of pre-Holocene buried OC are of interest in the described deposits. These are defined, for the purposes of this review as: (i) \u2018ancient\u2019 OC released through the weathering of sedimentary rocks during soil formation, physical weathering by ice during glacial times and from old soil horizons mixed with material during transport processes; and (ii) buried layers of OC rich materials such as or peat or palesols where the OC concentrations will likely reflect the soil characteristics at the time of burial. The term \u2018ancient\u2019 used in this context of buried OC refers to the concentration found in the soil \u2018C' horizon, which should largely be free from inputs of more recent OC. In soil pedological theory the \u2018C' horizon should exhibit the characteristics of the material that the soil is formed from (the SPM), and where leakage from more recent OC will be minimal as it is below the solum. The exact age of \u2018ancient OC' is unknown as it will have the potential, particularly through glacial and fluvial processes to come from many sources. That from eroded and weathered sedimentary rock will reflect the age of that rock. \u2018Ancient\u2019 OC is of interest, due to its ubiquitous presence in many SPM's described within this review such as till and glacial deposits, where it exists as the diluted OC concentrations of the eroded rock and pre-Holocene soil, with organic rich sedimentary rocks producing SPM deposits with greater OC. \u2018Ancient\u2019 OC may consist of some kerogen (Tissot and Welte, 1978; Hedges, 1992) formed during sedimentary diagenesis from plant, microbial, algal, planktonic or marine organic matter leading to the isomerization and aromatization of organic matter (Hood et al., 2015), and also will likely comprise a range of high molecular weight compounds of carboxyl and aromatic C (e.g. hydrocarbons), along with some phenol compounds, tannins, lignins, chitins and polysaccharides (D\u00fcmig et al., 2012). Typically, the incorporation of \u2018ancient OC' into SPM leads to low (< 0.5%) background concentrations in the parent (C horizon) material (D\u00fcmig et al., 2012; Eckmier et al., 2013; Lafreni\u00e9re and Sharp, 2004; Yang et al., 2020). The OC in Holocene deposits of interests (alluvium, colluvium) are defined for the purposes of this review as \u2018recent OC'. This will predominantly be made of OC that is up to ~10,000\u00a0yrs. old (although it may still contain the \u2018ancient OC' from the eroded material pool which forms the SPM).\n\n\n4\nDeposits of interest, their formation and spatial distribution\nA diverse array of processes leads to OC burial across landscapes. A multidisciplinary understanding of the particularities associated with each of these affords us a more holistic and precise understanding of where and how OC is buried, the thickness and properties of the burial material, and how susceptible buried OC is to being reincorporated into the global C cycle. Here, we review four key geomorphological realms \u2013 glacial, fluvial, aeolian and colluvial \u2013 each of which can entrain, transport and deposit sediment to bury OC.\n\n4.1\nSPM deposits formed from glacial deposits\nGlacial processes are recognized in the development of significant SPM throughout the UK (Catt, 1979). Within the UK-LGM limits, glacial related deposits are typically the most spatially widespread and Devensian glacial till is ubiquitous (Fig. 1a; Table 2\n), its extent representing the maximum ice coverage with respect to the spatial retreating and re-advances of the ice sheet during MIS2 (Fig. 2\n). Previously glaciated landscapes also contain large areas of hummocky terrain and characteristic features such as moraines and glacial fans. These are often described in geological mapping as diamicton (poorly sorted deposits) and are often distributed on valley sides and bottoms.\n\n\n4.2\nSPM associated with glacio-fluvial, glacio-lacustrine and fluvial processes\nDevensian glacio-fluvial sands are products of deposition by glacial meltwaters and often exist as sheet or delta like deposits of sand and gravels to form SPM. One of the major areas of mapped glacio-fluvial sands in the UK is in the Humber Estuary region of the UK (McEvoy et al., 2004), and their spatial distribution is consistent with the LGM limits (Fig. 1c; Table 2). Other deposits associated with glacio-fluvial processes are glaciolacustrine lake muds with a major deposit being found at the site of the Devensian Lake Humber \/ Fenland (Bateman et al., 2008).\nThe most widespread glacio-fluvial deposits forming SPM are river terraces created via the interplay between GIA and RSL, along with climate-driven surface processes, moderated by vegetation. Climate and vegetation is reflected in terrace development by the nature and OC content of the sediments. For the purposes of this review, interest focuses on terraces that date back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 (11\u201324\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP), many of which were cut and partially infilled by sand and gravel sequences during the later MIS 2. Ages are often <15\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP (Lewin and Gibbard, 2010). They now predominantly underlay Holocene alluvium (e.g. Brown et al., 1994). The continued existence of these terraces implies that they have survived the transition from post-glacial to Holocene river systems (e.g. Lewin and Gibbard, 2010; Brown et al., 2009). The mechanisms of formation suggest a climate\u2013vegetation response; reduced vegetation cover during colder phases increases the susceptibility of erosion, leading to increased sediment supply, while seasonal increases in fluvial discharge associated with spring thaw amplifies sediment transport capacity (Bridgland, 2000). The relative position of catchments in relation to the margins of the UK-LGM ice sheet is a critical factor in determining the nature of the terraces and modern floodplains. Bridgland et al. (2010) reported on the neighbouring Trent and Ouse river catchments. Both discharge into the Humber Estuary but exhibit markedly different terrace sequences. The Trent catchment was unglaciated during the Late Devensian and contains a well-constrained terrace archive that extends back into the Middle Pleistocene (Howard et al., 2007; White et al., 2010). By contrast, the Ouse catchment was glaciated during the Late Devensian and contains one valley bottom terrace that forms a basal lag beneath the modern Holocene alluvium. These scenarios are common for adjacent river systems that straddle the Late Devensian ice limit. The area of MIS 2 terraces has not been calculated for GB, as in geological databases they are part of a wider grouping of Quaternary Terraces, reflecting the complexity of dating often partially eroded, and inconsistent sediment deposits.\nHolocene alluvium deposits provide direct evidence of active soil erosion and deposition. They overlay late Devensian terrace or early Holocene basal deposits (Lewin and Gibbard, 2010; Brown et al., 2009) and their development as modern floodplain deposits on MIS 2 terraces increased rapidly ~1\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, coinciding with the agricultural revolution of the Middle Ages both in the UK (Macklin et al., 2010) and NW Europe (Hoffmann et al., 2008). Holocene alluvium deposits based on BGS maps (Fig. 1d; Table 2) cover 11,120\u00a0km2. Dated alluvial sediments provide time-constrained information on the changing rates of erosion in a catchment. Brown et al. (2013) suggest that since catchment size has been maintained during the Holocene, changes in floodplain deposition rates must reflect the difference in the inputs and exports from that reach. Thus, changes in the rate of sediment deposition must then reflect changes in the nature of sediment inputs. Patterns of floodplain development and alluvium deposition are also complex, often resulting in OC rich abandoned paleochannels (Brown et al., 1994) and roddens (Smith et al., 2012). The widespread deposition of alluvium has been dated for many rivers. For example, in lowland England, dates of non-palaeo-channel alluvium floodplain deposition started ~3.5\u20132.1\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP for the Soar and Nene rivers (Brown et al., 1994), reflecting the stabilization of the Holocene river systems.\n\n\n4.3\nSPM deposits associated with slope processes\nA variety of slope mass movement processes have formed SPM and buried OC since the UK-LGM. Slope processes are often cyclical and reflect continual interactions of climate, vegetation coverage and later anthropogenic impacts. \u2018Head Deposits\u2019 are a cold climate, mass movement deposit dominant across the UK, being formed where gelifluction, solifluction, and frost creep processes were active in transporting sediment downslope. Harrison et al. (2010) describe solifluction sheets as the \u2018most widespread sediment landform assemblage on the lower slopes of valleys in the deglaciated areas of Britain\u2019. Although they can take the form of isolated patches, solifluction sheets can be near continuous debris mantles up to 300\u00a0m wide, covering large areas of valley floors and lower slopes, as mapped by the BGS (Fig. 1b; Table 2). Many of the reported dates for Head deposits coincide with the Younger Dryas (cooling phase) and have depths >1\u00a0m. In addition, recognized erosion processes such as soil creep, sheet-wash, and gully erosion also contribute to the accumulation of these slope deposits. Typically, deposits consist of admixtures of gravel, sand, silt and clay, which are graded through the transport process. Hutchinson and Coope (2002) examined a solifluction sheet in southern England dated to the Younger Dryas. These formed under conditions of bare soil with sparse vegetation and an annual mean temperature of \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C, with it forming over successive summers when the active layer was mobile. Periglacial mud-sliding may have added further contributions.\nWhereas head deposits exist as major individual deposition events across the UK, they also form part of longer-term cycles of erosion, where climate and anthropogenic impacts interact. Two geographical areas in the UK have been studied extensively to reveal the cyclical nature of erosion; the valley infills on the chalk downs in southern Britain (Kerney, 1963; Kerney et al., 1964; Preece and Bridgland, 1999) and gully erosion in the uplands of Britain, particularly around the Solway Forth (Chiverrell et al., 2007). Chalk valley infill often demonstrates a sequence of climate and anthropogenic signals. An exemplar site was logged at Holywell Coombe (Preece and Bridgland, 1999). They estimated that Late Glacial aged deposits accounted for over 70% of the infill. Initially, during the post UK-LGM period (up to ~13\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP), chalk clasts accumulated in many valley bottoms through intense peri-glacial slope activity. In the subsequent B\u00f8lling interstadial (July max temp 17\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C, minimum winter \u22122 to \u22127\u00a0\u00b0C; 13\u201312\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP; (Coope, 1998)), humic chalk-rich and silt muds formed on the valley floors suggesting the development of marshy environments, with clay from landslides impeding drainage. These thin muds were subsequently overlain by a series of thick chalk muds and silts caused by solifluction when the climate deteriorated at the end of the B\u00f8lling period, prior to the start of the cooler Older Dryas. As the temperature increased again during the later Aller\u00f8d interstadial (July max 13\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C and winter minimum \u221218 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C, ground temperature\u00a0~\u00a00\u00a0\u00b0C for much of the year; peak ~13\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP), a paleosoil formed which has been widely recognized across the chalk downs (Evans, 1966; Peake, 1971; Kerney, 1963; Preece, 1994). Burial of the Aller\u00f8d soil by solifluction deposits occurred during the Younger Dryas stadial. Whilst initial deposits in the valley bottoms are pre-Holocene, later sediment deposits are associated with Holocene land-use change and particularly the Neolithic and Bronze Ages forest clearances (Preece, 1993). The deposits found at Holywell Coombe are considered representative of the wider chalk downland in southern England, although considerable local variability in the spatial erosion patterns is likely. Wilkinson (2003) reviewed seven chalk dry valley systems and concluded that whilst the patterns of sedimentation can be similar, the mechanisms and chronology of deposition vary between valleys. Factors influencing the deposition of sediments are likely to include sediment texture, variations in past land-use, the impact of storm activity, and local topography.\nConsiderable work regarding slope processes has also been undertaken in the areas (e.g. Howgill Fells, Bowland Fells) between North West England and Southern Scotland (e.g. Chiverrell et al., 2007). Three widespread landforms that may bury OC result from interactions between hillslopes and streams; gullies, alluvial fans\/debris cones, and valley-floor deposits. Hillslope gullies dissect steep, glacially or periglacially-modified hill slopes. In the Howgill Fells in North-West England, a representative area of the regional uplands, two types of hillslope gullies are present; older stabilized gullies and currently active gullies. Both have formed in previously deposited solifluction deposits and are primarily related to basal stream activity, either through lateral erosion by the main streams or incision of steep tributary channels. Harvey (1992) examined modern gully formation to understand the mechanisms of formation. Eroded sediment is deposited in storage areas (such as gully channels or basal zones). Storage in the basal zone often results in the formation of debris cones at the foot of the gully or as debris aprons below open slopes. The periodic removal of the sediment by axial streams, particularly during storm events leads to the rejuvenation of erosional activity on the slopes. Thus, cyclical erosion is initiated by intrinsic channel migration or storm induced erosion. However, once the relationship with the axial streams is severed through sediment accumulation or channel migration, the gullies become vegetated and stabilize within a maximum period of c. 150\u00a0yr (Harvey, 1992; Harvey, 2001; Chiverrell et al., 2007). The formation of alluvial fans and debris cones at the junctions of stream tributaries in the Bowland Fells have been dated to between 5400 and 1900 and\u00a0~\u00a0900 BP using 14C (Harvey and Renwick, 1987).\nFinally, since the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (approx. 7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP), soil erosion (colluvium) has increased due to vegetation clearance and the intensification of agriculture. It is a widespread process and several attempts to classify the severity of potential current soil erosion have been made (e.g. Morgan, 1985; Evans, 1990), the highest categories being linked with soils of sandy or silty texture, often with the SPM, being formed from previously deposited sediment (e.g. loess, coversands).\n\n\n4.4\nWind-blown erosion and deposits\nWind-blown sediments, including loess and cover-sand deposits, cover a combined area of 1040\u00a0km2 or 0.45% of the area of Great Britain (Table 2). The extent to which they act as SPM depends on initial deposit thickness, texture and later redistribution. Loess deposits typically have a clay content <20%, and a sand content of not >2%, with the remainder being silt. Widespread aeolian transport of loess requires a large supply of source material (produced by glacial grinding), dry periglacial conditions and minimal vegetation. Great Britain was situated on the western edge of the European loess belt. The primary loess deposition event was in the late Devensian (~18\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) and was considered to have covered large parts of the landscape of England. Jefferson et al. (2003) estimated that loess deposited across southern and midland England was 20 to 50\u00a0cm thick; this being based on the volume of sediment currently making up reworked large loess bodies in southern England. Some original loess deposits are still found. On the Chilterns Hills, a distinct thin loess deposit of ~0.3\u00a0m covers the Plateau drift, whilst on the North and South Downs, loess deposits of 0.4\u20130.9\u00a0m can be found (Catt and Hodgson, 1976). However, most remaining loess represents reworked deposits formed after widespread erosion and fluvial transport of the initial loess covering, particularly within the Wealden loess trap (Catt, 1977; Catt, 1978). The spatial distribution of loess has been mapped and the major remaining deposits are found in the south-eastern counties of England (Antoine et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2007; Scheib and Lee, 2010), with smaller deposits found in Devon and Cornwall (Roberts, 1985; Cattell, 1997). Knowledge of their depth is generally poor but reworked loess deposits in Kent and Essex can be up to 4\u00a0m in depth (Pitcher et al., 1954; Northmore et al., 2008).\nCoversand deposits differ from loess, being coarser and sourced from glacial outwash deposits located in the Southern North Sea Basin, along with deposits located around the margins of the ice sheet such as those from Lake Humber (Bateman, 1998). Coversands are prominent in Norfolk and Lincolnshire (Catt, 1977; Scheib and Lee, 2010) and redistribution has been recorded.\n\n\n\n5\nEvidence of the interactions of climate, vegetation and deposit age\nVegetation limits both the extent of erosion and SPM formation, along with influencing OC concentrations of buried deposits. Pollen analysis has helped identify the broad scale vegetation changes over the time-period of this review (Pennington, 1969), of which five vegetation phases appear of importance since the UK-LGM. First, SPM directly related to glacial climates (e.g. tills, moraines, diamicton, terraces, loess) reflect low NPP environments with vegetation assemblages associated with those of tundra like conditions. However, based on current knowledge of arctic environments, when NPP is low (particularly during MIS 2), considerable OC may be stored within some areas of tundra and boreal forests, likely due to slow decomposition rates (Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2000). However, knowledge of the extent of OC distribution across the UK during the early climatic periods under review, and how this may have influenced OC burial is unknown. Within the post UK-LGM to Holocene period, the warmer Aller\u00f8d interstadial occurred where NPP increased. Collins et al. (1996) described floodplains populated with birch and grassland, which later disappeared during the Younger Dryas. The third phase represents the period when vegetation stabilized the environment during the warming climate of the early Holocene (Ballantyne, 2008). Landscape stabilization took about ~3\u00a0K\u00a0years in Scotland and Ireland (Edwards and Whittington, 2001). A fourth phase reflects a period with relatively stable vegetated environments where erosion is likely to have been low. The fifth phase represents the onset of Neolithic (~6000\u00a0yrs. BP) agricultural intensification and land-use change where vegetation coverage was impacted at different spatial and temporal scales leading to widespread soil erosion. It is likely that land-use change and increased soil erosion reflect both the extent to which land was cultivable, but also regionally (e.g. N-S) where, for example, cooler climates reduce NPP, increasing recovery time after grazing, with the most intensive grazing practices leading to poaching and the creation of erosion pathways such as cattle tracks.\nThe extended C-V-E hypothesis is used as a concept to assess when SPM formation and subsequent OC burial took place in relation to these five phases following the UK-LGM. The occurrence of dated (14C or OSL) erosion events in climate periods and later human impacts, as well as OC burial depths, are reported in Tables 3-6\n\n\n\n.\n\n5.1\nThe UK-LGM to the Holocene\nFour major SPM depositional events are identified in this period (Tables 3 & 4). First, ice retreat (see Fig. 2), including localized re-advances and retreats due to warming starting ~27\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP (Clark et al., 2012), resulted in the widespread erosion and remobilisation of glacial sediments. Till deposition is also associated with ice re-advance and retreat during the Younger Dryas (Ballantyne, 2008; Bickerdike et al., 2018). Low NPP in cold climates and an abundance of unconsolidated material were essential in SPM being created during the MIS stage 2 river terrace formation. Various terraces have been identified as being post UK-LGM and of MIS 2 age between ~27 and 11.5\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP including on the Exe between 20 and 13\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP (Brown et al., 2010) and the Thames (Maddy et al., 2000; Maddy et al., 2001), although some may now be submerged in the offshore area (e.g. Westaway et al., 2006). Terrace development has also been identified during the cold Younger Dryas including on the Exe (c.13\u201311.5\u00a0k BP) (Brown et al., 2010) and the basal gravels of the Nene (11.2\u201310.2\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP and the Soar 28\u201310.2\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) (Brown et al., 1994). Third, low NPP and plant cover facilitated the major period of loess and cover sand deposition across parts of the UK between 25 and 16\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP. Dated loess deposits fall into three periods, coinciding with the late Devensian ice sheet (~18\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP; 14\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP; 11\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP). Singhvi et al. (2001) suggested that primary loess deposition stopped in Northern Europe ~15\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, confirming the consensus that one primary loess deposition phase occurred in England in the late Devensian (Catt, 2008). Later dates of deposition therefore likely represent hillslope and re-worked fluvial deposits.\nThe Heinrich events in the UK were considered dry and cold; ideal for the distribution and redistribution of sediment through aeolian transport. For example, coversand deposition in Norfolk occurred during stadials (MIS 5d\u2013MIS 2), but particularly during the Younger Dryas (~12.9\u201311.55\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) (Bateman et al., 2014). The initial deposition of the Breckland coversand in Norfolk was approximately 12.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.91\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP at Leziate (Hoare et al., 2002), whilst Bateman et al. (2000) identified three periods of coversand deposition near Caistor, Lincolnshire, at ~22, 16 and 6\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP.\n\nTable 4 describes the depth at which dated OC is found within a range of erosion deposits cited in the literature. Widespread buried OC coincides with the warmer Aller\u00f8d interstadial. Coversand and loess often exist as a series of layers separated by palaeosols or peat layers, thus defining hiatuses in deposition or re-distribution when stabilized land surfaces developed through warmer temperatures promoting NPP. A prominent peat layer found within these deposits, with 14C dates of 14\u201312\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP, is the Aller\u00f8d peat. Buried Aller\u00f8d OC deposits are also found within the cycles of mass movement deposits such as those found in chalkland valleys (Preece and Bridgland, 1999) and organic rich deposits in some river floodplains due to the increased NPP of this period. One example is the Wasling Sand from the River Kennet (Collins et al., 1996). These buried soils are likely a widespread occurrence across Great Britain, although few deposits have been dated. The fourth large erosion event was in the Younger Dryas when Head deposits were formed (e.g. Harrison et al., 2010), in cooler and lower NPP climates. Table 4 demonstrates that the depths of OC burial can extend down to 4\u00a0m.\n\n\n5.2\nEarly to Mid-Holocene\nDuring the Holocene, Bond (cooling) events have occurred within a generally warming climate (Table 1), along with possible \u2018flooding events\u2019 which were identified through increased soil erosion manifesting itself as floodplain soil accumulation (Benito et al., 2015). Table 5 summarizes dated erosion events during the Holocene. Evidence suggests that the first part of the Holocene was a period of landscape stabilization and soil formation, with few recorded dated erosion events; with the exception of those soil erosion events which helped identify the previously described \u2018flooding events\u2019. Edwards and Whittington (2001) examined sediment accumulation in 50 different lakes in Britain and Ireland, identifying reversals in 14C dating in sediment cores as a signal of terrestrial and older soil carbon input. The results indicated that many of the lakes in north and northwest Scotland displayed constant or decreasing sedimentation rates over time. This was attributed to: (i) thin soils forming on hard bedrock, (ii) the sealing effect of blanket peat, and (iii) low population density allowing for a maturation of the landscape where vegetation stabilized the landscape and soil. However, some evidence suggests that aeolian re-distribution events (Table 5) coincided with the cooler Bond events (Table 1). Vincent et al. (2011) examined the age of loess redistribution deposits on the limestone uplands of north-west England using OSL dating where 9 out of 15 dates were coincident with a hypothesized climatic deterioration at 8.5\u20138.0\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP.\n\n\n5.3\nMid Holocene to present day\nIn the second part of the Holocene soil erosion is a major contributor to OC burial, with identifiable erosion episodes forming the basis of the \u2018Flooding Events\u2019 concept, along with human impacts. Table 6 provides information regarding specific dated buried OC deposits and the depth at which they were buried, with depths extending to ~4\u00a0m. Prior to the Benito et al. (2015) study, a significant database of UK 14C dated sediments (Macklin and Lewin, 2003; Macklin et al., 2012; Macklin et al., 2013) and extensive meta-analyses had enabled the production of national and regional reconstructions of anthropogenic alluvium deposition (Macklin et al., 2014). A review of dated deposits suggests some soil erosion and mass transport events may have coincided with Bond events at 5.4 and 4.7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP (e.g. see Curry, 2000; Benito et al., 2015). However, whilst these Bond events were not noted for specific climate cooling (Table 1), they often partially or fully overlapped with dates of \u2018Flooding Events\u2019, suggesting increasing difficulties in ascribing erosion to specific climate events. Later Bond events may not have been sufficiently long or intense enough to cause major changes to vegetation cover or that they instigated cooler, yet drier periods. For example, whilst the identification of the 4.2\u00a0ka BP event has been observed globally), there is no coherent record of it in the UK and Ireland, suggesting that the atmospheric-oceanic circulation changes produced did not cause a measurable impact or it has not been preserved due to anthropogenic activity (Roland et al., 2014). Evidence of a 2.8\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP event within a period of considerable climate change between c.3.25 to 2.6\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP has been suggested (Roland et al., 2014), characterized by a shift towards wetter conditions, proceeded by a notably drier period, but to the best of our knowledge no direct erosional evidence has been demonstrated to date in the UK.\nPrior to the recognition of the \u2018flooding events of\u2019 Benito et al. (2015), several studies had alluded to \u2018fluvial events\u2019 being triggers for increased soil erosion, particularly in northwest England and Scotland. For example, Reid and Thomas (2006) suggested that during the mid- and late Holocene, individual storm events, combined with anthropogenic vegetation removal, were the dominant slope processes, creating paleo-podzols in valleys, whilst Tipping (1995a, 1995b) recorded a series of colluvial and stream in-washings of hillslope sediment to a peat-filled valley bottom at Carn Dubh in Scotland. In addition, buried vegetation underneath solifluction deposits in the Caingorms in Scotland (e.g. Ballantyne, 1986; Sugden, 1971; Mottershead, 1978) have been 14C dated and broadly align with phases of greater precipitation in Scotland (e.g. Tipping, 1995a, 1995b).\nWhile many late Holocene erosion and mass movement dated events partially or fully overlap with \u2018Flooding Events\u2019, many events, particularly on slopes, do not coincide and demonstrate the impact of Neolithic and later deforestation and land-use change processes in the UK. Edwards and Whittington (2001) identified three clusters of increased sediment accumulation in lake cores between 5.29 and 4.97, 4.53\u20134.23 and 2.98\u20132.81\u00a0K\u00a0yr. The authors suggest that these periods broadly link to: (i) intensification of Neolithic agriculture in northern Europe and the decline of Elm trees at ~5.1\u00a0K\u00a0yr, (ii) continued expansion of Neolithic agricultural practices and (iii) Bronze Age tree clearances, respectively. However, these dates also partially coincide with \u2018flooding events\u2019 which suggests a possible combined climate and land-use effect.\nFurther examples include gulley formation in northwest England and the Southern Uplands of Scotland, where the formation of the older stabilized gullies have been heavily linked to land-use and vegetation change. Cundill (1976) suggested that soil erosion was linked to cyclical episodes of major woodland clearances in Howgill Fells, Cumbria. These episodes included ones at 3.84\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP initiated by Bronze age humans, 2.29\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP possibly related to climate deterioration but more likely anthropogenic, after 2.29\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP during the Roman period, and after periods of woodland regeneration during the Dark ages (1.6\u20131\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) and the Norse period (1.2\u20130.95\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP). The latter period coincided with an increase in intensive Medieval sheep farming in the area. Harvey et al. (1984) dated paleosols within debris cones using 14C in the Bowland Fells in Lancashire and Howgills Fells in Cumbria, and suggested deposition occurred between 2.71 and 2.50\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP and\u00a0~\u00a01\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP. Again, it is likely these were due to land clearances and management changes such as imported (intensive) Scandinavian sheep grazing practices. Chiverrell et al. (2007) summarized much of the work undertaken in the upland areas of NW England by collating 14C data from buried OC in alluvial fan deposits from the upland regions surrounding the Solway Firth and Morecombe Bay to understand the widespread controls on gully formation. The 14C data suggested that four main phases of gully erosion occurred between 2.5 and 2.2, 1.3\u20131.0, 1.0\u20130.8 and\u00a0~\u00a00.5\u00a0K\u00a0cal\u00a0yr BP. Whilst these periods often partially overlap with identified \u2018flooding events\u2019, high magnitude storm events are considered the primary driver for initiation of gully erosion. The absence of gully systems developed before 3\u00a0K\u00a0cal. yr BP suggested that the increase in gullying after 2.5\u00a0K\u00a0cal. yr BP was also linked to population expansion and deforestation during Iron Age and Romano-British times. In the highlands of Scotland, Curry (2000) studied debris flows on drift mantled hillslopes and found four reworking phases (6.5\u20136.2, 5.6\u20135.3, 4.9\u20134.6 and after 0.45\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP). A re-evaluation of results in the context of Benito et al. (2015) suggest some overlap to \u2018flooding-events\u2019. However, the date of the fourth event (0.45\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) is also coincident with the Little Ice Age suggesting a possible climate interaction along with deforestation. These recorded mid to late Holocene events, demonstrate the complexity of the interactions between possible \u2018flooding events\u2019 and land-use change and intensification on the initiation of soil erosion events in Great Britain. Human impacts on the redistribution of aeolian cover-sand deposits are also evident at Breckland in Norfolk, an inland dune system developed during the Anglian (400\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) (Bateman and Godby, 2004), where five episodic re-distribution events have been identified: c.6.50, c.1.60\u20131.10, c.0.50, c.0.40\u20130.33 and from c.0.20\u20130.30\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP. It is likely that this redistribution resulted from interactions between intensive sheep grazing and possible climatic (Bond event) oscillations at 1.60\u20131.10 and 0.5\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP.\nMany Holocene OC burial processes associated with alluvium (floodplains) and colluvium (hillslope toes) reflect OC burial processes over a period of time. These deposits will, contain \u2018recent\u2019 OC with a range of ages reflecting the deposition period, with older OC at the bottom of the deposit, but also allow for vegetation inputs from the surface (as discussed in Section 3). In particular, mid-late Holocene erosion processes influenced by human activities are known to have changed the rate of sediment and carbon deposition on floodplains compared to earlier Holocene periods. A visible change in both sedimentation and OC burial is often seen and have been described as \u2018discontinuities of human-induced alluviation\u2019 (Brown et al., 2013). Many of these later \u2018flooding events\u2019 were described as being more related to increased human driven catchment erosion and infrastructure placement.\nIn the UK the major interest in floodplain carbon deposits has primarily been associated with \n14\nC dating for landscape evolution and later climate and anthropogenic impact studies (Macklin et al. 2014). Results have contributed into the interpretation of \u2018flooding events\u2019 described by Benito et al., 2015). However, Mid to late Holocene increases in sediment and OC burial associated with human impacts are often complex processes, both spatially and temporally. An indication of the variation of current sedimentation rates on floodplains was produced by Walling et al. (2006a, 2006b). They examined floodplain deposition of OC on six English rivers with sediments having mean concentrations of OC ranging between 2.17 and 5.07% OC, and sediment deposition rates of 69\u2013114\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22122\n\u00a0yr\u22121\n. Greater interest in the OC budgets caused by human impacts have been undertaken in other countries, and many of these responses would equally apply to GB floodplains. In Europe and the US, late Holocene human impacts in catchments (e.g. deforestation, introducing infrastructure) have been found to influence sediment and OC burial rates on floodplains. Ricker et al. (2012b) suggested that in areas of fast accretion rates, where buried surface horizons existed, greater OC stores were found compared to slower accreting areas of the riparian zones. The accretion was driven by catchment deforestation (Ricker et al., 2012a, 2012b). Manipulation of river channels with dams or other infrastructure for water powered mills in the 17-19th century have also fundamentally changed the nature of floodplains in the US and Europe from small anabranching systems with extensive wetlands and large carbon stores to \u2018slack water' sedimentation systems that have buried the natural pre-human systems and made floodplains essentially into fill terraces. The final stages of floodplain change that impacts sedimentation and OC burial is seen in the installation of drainage systems and the canalisation of rivers (Walter and Merits, 2008; Brown et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n6\nThe influence of the climate-vegetation-erosion pathway on deposit thickness\nInteractions between climate and vegetation are fundamental controls on erosion within the C-V-E concept, in addition to other known variables involved in the supply and transfer of sediment including topography, sediment texture, sediment availability and transport capacity. These combine to determine erosion and deposition rates, leading to the spatial extent and thickness of deposits. The thickness of deposit is important with respect to buried carbon as it is (i) an indicator of the energy of the erosion process, sediment availability and likely OC concentration and source, (ii) it determines the depth at which OC may be buried and (iii) in some instances determines the depth to which \u2018ancient\u2019 OC is distributed through the SPM profile. For (i) above, there is an additional link between the amount of OC associated with different particle sizes transported, with clay particles usually having greater OC associated with them than sand or silt sized particles. Little work has been undertaken comparing the mean thickness of deposit types discussed in this review. Partly, this relates to the difficulty of constraining estimates of deposit thickness over sufficiently large areas. Fig. 3\n reports post UK-LGM deposit thickness from the high-resolution 3D geological models at Talla (Scheib et al. (2008) and Shelford (Tye et al., 2011). In Fig. 4\n, deposit thickness from lower resolution 3D geological models provide a wider \u2018first-order' overview across Great Britain.\n\n6.1\nThe UK-LGM to the Holocene\nDeposits in this period reflect cold climate and glacial-related processes within generally low NPP environments, and are generally thicker than those of the Holocene. For example, at Talla (Fig. 3) average till thickness is ~6\u00a0m, whilst the moraine deposits are ~6\u00a0m. River terraces at Talla (within LGM) have a mean thickness of ~2.7\u00a0m, whereas the thickness of the MIS 2 terrace deposit at Shelford is 7.65\u00a0m. Deposit thickness in the low resolution 3D models (Fig. 4) for this period are broadly similar to those reported in the high-resolution models, with deposits, such as the Devensian till, having a median thickness of ~8\u00a0m. Analysis of the median potential till depth in MIS2 - MIS 1 deposits is ~6\u00a0m (McMillan et al., 2011). At Shelford, \u2018Head\u2019 deposits have a mean thickness of 0.56\u00a0m. The thickness of solifluction deposits reflect the paraglacial response of the landscape, where it is \u2018relaxing\u2019 and achieving a new dynamic equilibrium with slopes and rivers adjusting to enhanced sediment budgets, seasonal discharge regimes (i.e. seasonal melt) and low vegetation (Matsuoka, 2001).\n\n\n6.2\nThe Holocene\nAs described previously, the early Holocene was likely a period of relative landscape stabilization, in contrast to the late Holocene, which has been dominated by land-use change and soil erosion, leading to colluvial deposits accumulating on hillslope toes, and the formation of soils on modern floodplains. The thickness of colluvial deposits are not well represented in the low-resolution 3D models, as deposits are thin and difficult to identify. However, in the Shelford model (Fig. 3) the average thickness at the bottom of the hillslope is 0.5\u00a0m.\nValley deposits with 14C dates allow for comparisons between deposition events created through climate and those initiated by human impact, although slope characteristics (length, slope, aspect) and soil texture need to be considered. Dated deposits have been used to estimate Neolithic soil erosion, particularly on chalk downlands, where colluvial deposits represent the upper part of the record of erosion events to have occurred over time. Preece and Bridgland, 1999 found colluvial deposits up to 2.5\u00a0m thick from erosion events occurring between 8 and 3.5\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP. Later erosion events (1.865 +\/\u2212 80\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP (OxCal age from 1.989 to 1.610\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP) have been dated to Roman times by Espejo et al. (1992) who measured deposition of 46\u00a0cm of a flinty silt loam in chalkland valleys, believed to be associated with the cereal cultivation required to feed the resident Roman army. Modelled estimates of the magnitude of soil erosion on the chalk downs of England were made by Favis-Mortlock et al. (1997) who assessed the impact of anthropogenic activity on the erosion of loess-based soils from 7\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP to the present day. Results identified a major period of soil loss between 4 and 1.8\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP as agriculture slowly became more intensive. An estimated initial loess thickness of 1.2\u00a0m was reduced to 0.58\u00a0m within the modelling and proved to be a reasonable prediction of present day soil depth and stone content. Ellis and Newsome (1991) suggested that soil erosion occurred on the chalk downs 2\u20133\u00a0K\u00a0yr BP largely through cultivation. Removal from a gentle, upper valley slope over this period was estimated to be 375\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 or equivalent to a loss of 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121.\nEstimates of contemporary net erosion rates for UK soils measured using 137Cs (Quine and Walling, 1991; Walling and Quine, 1991; Owens et al., 1997; Walling et al., 2002; DEFRA, 2005; Walling et al., 2006; Boardman et al., 2009) span across three orders of magnitude with a median erosion rate of ~300\u00a0t\u00a0km\u22122\u00a0yr\u22121 for UK arable and grassland soils. Slope lengths ranged between 39 and 278\u00a0m with maximum angles between 2.1 and 23\u00b0. These estimates do not include erosion rates from catastrophic events such as muddy floods on the South Downs (Boardman, 1995) or gully erosion events (Evans and Nortcliff, 1978). The other major late Holocene deposit is alluvium. The thickness of alluvium can often be approximated by the depth of increased OC concentrations. Alluvium deposit thickness at Talla and Shelford suggest depths are typically <1\u00a0m (Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n7\nOrganic carbon concentrations in deposits\nThere is evidence for two hypotheses to describe OC concentrations in deposits since the UK-LGM. First, Milankovitch-scale glacial driven processes have the potential to produce thick SPM (C horizon) deposits that have relatively low concentrations of OC, reflecting the low NPP environments at the time of erosion, and the contribution, dilution and mixing of existing soil organic carbon, along with \u2018ancient OC' excavated from weathered sedimentary material. Second, Holocene deposits (largely colluvial and alluvial) are likely to be thinner due to greater vegetation coverage ameliorating erosion. However, they are likely to have higher concentrations of OC due to greater NPP, building soil OC.\nWith regards to the first hypothesis, Table 7\n shows concentrations of OC from deposits specifically related to glacial processes (e.g. till, diamicton, and morainic material) and cold climate environments (e.g. terraces, loess, coversand, glacio-fluvial and glacio-lacustrine deposits) which have been reported using OC data collated from examples of UK B\/C and C horizons of soil profiles. Typically, these glacially-derived deposits have OC concentrations in their C horizons <0.2%. Any input or leakage of Holocene OC into these SPM deposits will largely depend on later soil development processes based on ecosystem type, landscape position, deposit texture, and climate. Glacial deposits also create paleosols due to deposition over existing soils or sediments. The Torrie silts in Scotland are ~3\u00a0m thick organic-rich lacustrine silts that were buried by Younger Dryas glacial till (Merritt et al., 1990). Knowledge of the variation in OC concentration within head deposits is minimal despite their pervasiveness (e.g. Preece et al. 1993; Harrison et al., 2010), with key controls including the time of formation, magnitude, the climate severity inducing solifluction-type processes, and previous levels of soil development as a source material. (See Table 8.)\n\nThe second hypothesis suggests that Holocene deposits are likely to be thinner but have greater OC concentrations. In many cases, the depth of elevated OC concentrations within a soil profile will reflect the rate of sediment deposition. Alluvial soils are recognized as potential long-term OC storage sinks (Ferguson et al., 2020; Mayer et al., 2018; D'Elia et al., 2017). Fig. 5\n shows OC concentrations of eight typical GB Holocene alluvial or floodplain soils. Elevated concentrations of OC are found at depths >1\u00a0m, but will be dependent on the river system and their location within the floodplain. Many floodplain soils in southern Britain have OC concentration profiles that decline with depth (40\u00a0cm) but have concentrations >4% OC at the surface (Walling et al. 2006). Within Holocene floodplain soils, a range of deposits are found with elevated OC such as cut-off channel infills, old channels and other relics of river migration across floodplains. Roddens (sand and silt filled tidal creeks deposits) are also found (Smith et al. 2010). Many of these features are deep, and are often highly visible through aerial photography or lidar imagery (Howard et al., 2008).\nIn Fig. 6\n the concepts discussed in this paper are summarized using OC data collected during the production of the 3D model at Shelford (Tye et al. 2010). Fig. 6a shows OC profiles with depth across a catena lithosequence (Fig. 6c), predominantly composed of superficial deposits laid down following the UK-LGM. The Holme Pierrepoint sand and gravel river terraces (MIS 2) underlay both the Late Devensian head, where the slope intersects the river terrace, and the later Holocene alluvium deposits that make up the modern floodplain. The modern Holocene floodplain probably represents a cut off deposit reflecting river migration as it is enriched in % OC (1\u20132%) to depths of 2\u00a0m, rather than the more typical Holocene alluvium % OC profiles shown in Fig. 5. In the MIS 2 river terraces, the SPM OC amounts to approx. 0.1%. In Fig. 6b, the SPM formed in the sedimentary bedrock geology underlying the catena shows low concentrations of \u2018ancient\u2019 OC (<0.1%) found at depth. This likely represents the OC that is likely to be found in glacial deposits following glacial excavation.\nColluvium is a major source of Holocene deposition (Leopold and V\u00f6lkel, 2007). Slope processes are often local and highly complex, often producing a sequence of SPM and organic carbon burial (e.g. Reid and Thomas, 2006; Chiverrell et al., 2007; Preece, 1993). Local factors such as weather events (e.g. storms), vegetation coverage, slope angle, sediment texture, catchment drainage properties and, more recently, land-use (including change) and cultivation practices, all contribute to the magnitude of transport over given time. Whilst contemporary soil erosion across the UK is widespread, surprisingly few assessments have been made of how erosion (water & cultivation) has influenced OC concentrations and stocks along hillslope transects from ridge to toe slope. Soil thickening on toe-slopes is evident (Evans et al., 2019) but there is still much discussion as to whether toe-slopes act as sinks for OC because of the interactions between physical transport, biological, chemical and physiochemical processes as soil is transported downslope (de Nijs and Cammeraat, 2020; Lugato et al., 2018).\n\n\n8\nEstimates of OC storage\nMonte-Carlo simulations were used to estimate, on a \u2018first-order' basis the mass of Total OC stored in deposits after erosion processes, with the aim being to demonstrate the extent that erosion processes are involved in transferring carbon through the landscape and its burial over time. Masses were estimated for UK-LGM Till, Devensian glacio-fluvial deposits and Holocene alluvium as these were the deposits where sufficient data existed to allow calculations. The following conditions were applied for the Monte-Carlo simulations. For, Devensian Till and Glacio-fluvial deposits we use the \u2018C' or soil parent material concentration for the whole depth of the deposit. This therefore enables us to calculate on a \u2018first-order' basis the OC burial for the whole depth of deposit, but not count the OC inputted from later vegetation and microbial inputs. By assuming the \u2018C' horizon concentration any inputs of more recent OC is limited in the calculation.\nAssigning a value for OC concentration stored in the Holocene alluvium was more complicated than for the other deposits. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon in river waters associated with suspended sediment in GB has a median value of ~8% (Worrall et al., 2018). This is comparatively greater than the % OC values reported in alluvial soils (Fig. 7\n), suggesting that dilution and losses via microbial respiration take place during and after transport. In addition, after deposition, soils will often receive inputs of plant carbon. We therefore assigned a conservative value based on the range at the lowest-most parts of the OC profiles shown in Fig. 7 of between 0.2 and 2%. The range of parameters used to predict OC mass for the three deposits are shown in Table 9\n.\nResults are shown in Fig. 7 and median values for OC transport and storage in post UK-LGM till, alluvium and glacio-fluvial deposits are 328.7, 48.49 and 7.85 MT respectively (a total of 385MT). These values do not include river terraces and those buried deposits resulting from slope erosion processes (e.g. colluvium and gully erosion). However, these values demonstrate the important role of erosion processes in the transport and burial of large amounts of OC over time, of which much will be \u2018ancient OC'. These values can be placed into context by their comparison with other published figures for OC inventories in soils of the UK, thus demonstrating the magnitude of the erosion and burial process. Part of our estimates would also be included in estimates of SOC when considered to a depth of 1\u00a0m, (e.g. they are likely to include the upper part of the \u2018C' horizon). Bradley et al. (2005) estimated a figure of 4266 MT OC in soils to a depth of 1\u00a0m in the UK, and 2370 MT if only the 0\u201330\u00a0cm depth increment was considered. The estimated mass of buried OC from this study, and only three deposit types, therefore represents 9 and 16% of these totals respectively. Rawlins et al. (2011) estimated that the mass of soil inorganic carbon in soils (0\u201330\u00a0cm) of England as 186 MT. Thus, the mass of buried OC reported would represent 206% of this value.\n\n\n9\nDiscussion\n\n9.1\nMain findings\nA \u2018first-order' understanding of the processes producing the spatial distribution and magnitude of SPM and buried OC since the UK-LGM has been described using an extended C-V-E hypothesis which also assessed the impact of smaller climate variations recorded in the GRIP, along with identified \u2018flooding events'. SPM deposits with associated OC concentrations demonstrated some correspondence to climate and NPP production, up to the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. After this, evidence suggests that the \u2018flooding events' as described by Benito et al. (2015), particularly when combined with human interaction, have been major drivers of erosion and OC burial. The Holocene Bond events, apart from the 8.2\u00a0k\u00a0yr event, did not produce a significant erosion signal, although some aeolian redistribution events were identified. However, in parts of eastern Europe, some linkage between Bond events and erosion has been suggested (Dreibrodt et al. 2020 and references therein), but conditions are likely to reflect the more continental locations.\nThe magnitude of deposit thickness, important as a store for \u2018ancient OC' and for depth of burial, demonstrated that glacially derived deposits were generally thickest. These deposits were often >1.5\u00a0m, the thickness threshold typically accounted for within the UK OC inventory (Bradley et al., 2005). Glacial deposits are generally well mixed and cover large areas, and whilst OC concentrations are low, similar to those found in C horizons (~0.1%), the volume of material, combined with high bulk densities, are likely to contribute to significant OC stocks (e.g. Simo et al., 2019; Harper and Tibbett, 2013). This was demonstrated by the \u2018first order' estimates produced in Fig. 7. Incorporating measurements of OC concentrations and bulk density for the whole soil profile (i.e., from the soil surface down to the soil-bedrock interface) may more accurately constrain carbon budgets. However, the depth variable deposits with potentially greater OC concentrations that occur as toe slope deposits, valley infills, and alluvial fans, often as part of longer-term cycles of OC burial, are relatively poorly spatially mapped, and their buried OC poorly accounted for.\nAdditional buried carbon sinks, concomitant with the time-period of this review but beyond its scope, include coastal and estuarine peats formed through burial during GIA and sea level change (Allen and Haslett, 2007; Wheeler and Waller, 1995) and landslides (Boon et al., 2015). Buried OC linked to erosion processes are also found stored in mill ponds, lakes and reservoirs (Butcher et al., 1993; Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2017). In addition, whilst this review deals with post UK-LGM erosion, the analysis could also be extended back to older UK glaciations including the Anglian. The Anglian was a more extensive and longer glacial event in the UK resulting in greater deposition of glacial till (Clayton, 2000), along with river terrace sequences with buried OC or palaeosols developed during warmer periods (Langford et al., 2007). However, these assessments may only be possible south of the UK-LGM because of later glaciations and would also be complicated by 430,000\u00a0years of post-Anglian erosion.\nKnowledge of the spatial distribution of OC deposits, along with soil physicochemical properties, would allow for a comparative examination of the biogeochemical and geophysical processes that have contributed to successful long-term sequestration of the OC, thus assessing their suitability for future \u2018frontier' technologies, and particularly the mechanisms that enhance OC chemical stability. When determining future national OC management strategies, increasing importance needs to be placed on understanding the extent to which buried OC may re-enter the global carbon cycle, to which all buried OC is susceptible if perturbed. Oxidation by microbial processes will impact recent and \u2018ancient\u2019 OC, albeit at different rates. Incorporation of ancient OC weathered from sedimentary rocks during soil formation, and subsequent oxidation processes, can lead to significant loss of ancient or petrogenic OC (Hemingway et al., 2018). Current glacial systems have been identified as a source of CO2 as microbial communities oxidise petrogenic OC (Horan et al., 2017). However, buried OC oxidation rates are generally limited due to physical and chemical isolation from microbial activity (De Nobilia et al., 2001; Hamer and Marschner, 2005; Ewing et al., 2006; Baisden and Parfitt, 2007; Fontaine et al., 2007). Oxidation rates also reflect soil properties, such as mineralogy and texture, which control drainage and O2 exclusion, and influence the physical protection of buried OC. Within the context of changing environmental pressures, experimental work has shown (i) deep OC pools are often more responsive to temperature increases (Schwendenmann and Veldkamp, 2006) and (ii) the evidence of the potential for \u2018priming\u2019 old carbon with new carbon. Bernal et al. (2016) demonstrated that substrate additions to mimic plant root exudates (glucose, alanine) and leaf litter could increase the mineralization of OC buried to depths of 2.7\u00a0m. This \u2018priming effect\u2019 could complicate \u2018frontier' technologies, such as the use of deep-rooted plants, to sequester OC deeper in soils. Relatively little work has been undertaken to understand these processes in different lithological and subsoil environments.\nBuried OC is likely to be disturbed where land-use is most intensive, leading to perturbations which reduce separation between old and new OC. For example, soils formed within glacially derived SPM are some of the most productive agricultural soils and are subject to regular cultivation. These soils may be favoured for hosting \u2018frontier technologies\u2019 as they are accessible. As populations grow, there is expected to be increased encroachment, engineering and construction onto these soils which will further accelerate their erosion (Price et al., 2011; Barthel et al., 2019). Furthermore, excavation or human disturbance activities may lead to the formation of new hydraulic pathways, allowing fresh carbon (e.g. DOM) to be eluviated deeper into profiles or lost through the land-ocean continuum (Butman et al., 2015). Buried layers such as the Aller\u00f8d peat or OC in paleosols may be exposed, or brought closer to surface environments, through perturbations such as erosion or excavation, whilst the OC in colluvial and alluvial deposits is concentrated so perturbation may increase reintroduction to the global C cycle.\nChanging climates may also add to perturbation of buried OC. Increased rainfall intensity may increase the entrainment and transport of colluvium downslope. Where soils thin on backslopes, increased weathering and release of OC from bedrock may increase as soil formation rates increase as soils thin (Evans et al., 2019). For alluvial soils, bank erosion by rivers can re-introduce both \u2018recent\u2019 and \u2018ancient\u2019 OC (Adams et al., 2015), typically differentiated by measuring 14C and 13C ratios (Blair et al., 2003), back into the C cycle. Whilst, Cole and Caraco (2001) suggest that ancient terrestrial carbon (1000\u20135000\u00a0yrs. old) may be an important source of labile carbon, the extent and mechanisms of aquatic (water and sediment) priming effects are still being debated (Bengtsson et al., 2018; Gintikaki & Witte, 2019).\n\n\n9.2\nUncertainties and limitations\nWith respect to OC budgets, this review has revealed the paucity of knowledge regarding buried OC beyond that recorded through national soil surveys, which for large areas is only mapped at 1:250 or 1:50\u00a0K and to a maximum depth of 1.5\u00a0m. In addition, where buried OC has been found in landscape evolution studies (e.g. paleosols), its position within a sediment profile is known, but there is little information relating to its spatial extent and concentration. This is particularly true where externally transported material has resulted in buried soils, both in cold (e.g. talus and aeolian deposits) and warm (e.g. alluvial fans) climates. Significantly, the lack of information likely results from the perceived unimportance of buried OC during the times of major geological and soil survey in the UK (1873\u20132000). This reflects the changing priorities of surveys. A further example was the initial priority given to the geological mapping of bedrock, at the expense of thinner superficial deposits in the past (Booth et al., 2015), which may lead to underestimation of the spatial extent of some deposits (e.g. head, colluvium, alluvium). In landscape and geomorphological reconstruction, OC age and its position within profiles has usually been the driver of interest, and not OC concentration. A systematic survey of these deposits is required to understand the extent and concentrations of OC in these deposits, and the controls of NPP, slope and texture.\n\n\n9.3\nGoing forward - implications and future research needs\nThe importance of buried OC is that it exists as a store of C, but with the potential that it may be re-introduced into the active global carbon cycle in the future, as DOC (Butman et al., 2015), POC (Worrall et al., 2016) and if oxidised as CO2. This presents a significant challenge to scientists tasked with conceiving ways of maintaining or increasing the long-term storage of buried OC. Despite the limitations in understanding OC concentrations and often their highly localized spatial extents, sufficient evidence exists to (i) produce a \u2018first order' spatial framework, or national model, to identify those different landscapes where buried OC may be found and its type, and (ii) provide evidence that a more detailed terrestrial OC budget for the UK, including the inclusion of deeper buried carbon, should be considered. Initially the framework could adapt the \u2018Quaternary Provinces and Domains' approach the BGS have developed (Booth et al., 2015). Advances in digital soil mapping techniques and geomorphological analysis may help in identifying buried carbon sinks on slopes by assessing transport pathways and deposition zones. The question of how policy makers best formulate strategies for the management and preservation of buried carbon needs to be addressed, particularly towards alluvial and colluvial soils as both are currently active processes as well as representing historical stores. How drainage and land development may alter water tables depth, essential for controlling access of air to buried OC would be a key question (Yabusaki et al., 2017).\nWithin this \u2018first order' framework, considerable knowledge gaps exist. These represent areas where the disciplines of biogeochemistry and geomorphology need to be bought together (Hoffmann et al., 2013). A key focus for further work is understanding in greater detail the net balance of OC resulting from modern day soil erosion and deposition on slopes as this is the dominant current erosion process. Firstly, do transport processes result in OC sequestration on toe-slopes or mineralization and release of CO2 (Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2014b), and how do these vary with soil types? Secondly, does increasing the thickness of the soil profile on toe-slopes through erosion increase the amount of OC stabilized within a thickened soil profile over time (Doetterl et al., 2015). Thirdly, losses of soil on backslopes through erosion are particularly significant given that natural soil formation rates have been shown to be slow (Evans et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2021). This is particularly important where erosion is accelerated by modern land use, leaving backslope soil profiles shallower, and with a commensurately smaller OC storage potential. In addition, the thinning of upslope profiles may bring OC, once stored at depth, closer to the surface. However, slope erosion processes may also lead to periods of accelerated soil formation, serving to reverse the trajectory of soil thinning. Within this process, fresh oxide and clay minerals may be released that could help protect future OC from microbial decomposition, but again this may be balanced by an increase in \u2018ancient\u2019 OC released from sedimentary rocks and moving into areas where there is potential for \u2018priming\u2019. Integrating these processes into global C models for slopes remains a key research objective.\nThe geomorphological processes described above need to be considered in conjunction with an increased understanding of how the range of erosion processes (e.g. rate of deposition, SPM texture and aggregation), and the time scales they operate over, lead to the successful sequestration of OC through burial. Fundamental research is required to understand preservation processes of buried and ancient OC, including the interactions between OC and mineralogy. Recent work has focused on the nanoscale (Basile-Doelsch et al., 2015) but understanding how aggregation, which affords OC preservation in the topsoil (Oades and A.G., 1991), can be enhanced in deeper soils and the effects of age is another key topic. Interactions of buried OC also need to be considered with respect to other potential technologies that could sequester CO2 such as the use of basalt mineral weathering when applied to soils (Kelland et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n10\nConclusions\nThis review was based on data associated with the specific climatic, geomorphological and geological conditions of Great Britain. However, the role of C-V-E and the processes resulting in buried OC will be applicable to other countries, but will vary according to their specific conditions. Several broad categories of buried OC have been identified, but generally little work has been undertaken regarding understanding how SPM properties have contributed to the preservation and protection of buried OC through time. Understanding where buried OC exists within landscapes provides a first step towards greater understanding as well as being an archive of material for such studies. SPM exists as a potential sink for OC associated with \u2018frontier technologies\u2019 but understanding how fresh carbon burial may interact with existing buried OC is key. It is also apparent that greater understanding is required of how human perturbation, particularly the ability to excavate large areas and masses of SPM, along with modifying hydrological pathways, impacts the existing buried OC store.\n\n","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe surface of the Earth has been shaped by numerous geological processes over the past four and a half billion years. We tend, however, to think mostly about the processes that have been experienced in human history, such as erosive forces, volcanism, and earthquakes, which remind us that our planet is geologically active. Even with volcanic eruptions, however, there have thankfully been no globally significant, super eruptions as part of humanity's experience; although the 1815\u201316 Tambora eruption appears to have come very close (e.g., Oppenheimer, 2003). This also holds true for significant meteorite impact events, which is likely as a major reason as to why, until the latter part of the 20th century, the importance of impacts as a planetary geological process was not recognized. The advent of planetary exploration demonstrated, however, that impact craters are a dominant geological feature on the Moon and, as we have learned over the subsequent five decades, on the majority of the rocky planets, dwarf planets, moons and asteroids throughout the solar system. Since the 21st century, the realization that asteroids and comets have impacted planetary bodies throughout geological time has revolutionized our understanding of solar system history and evolution. Indeed, it is now widely recognized that impact cratering is one of the most important and fundamental geological processes in the solar system. The large fireball event and meteorite shower of February 15th 2013 over the Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia (Brown et al., 2013) also served as a reminder that impact events are not a phenomenon past geological eras but continue today.\nOur understanding of how impacts have shaped the geological and biological evolution of Earth and other solar system bodies is constantly evolving. What is clear is that the rates of bombardment were much higher in the first half a billion years of solar system history (e.g., Bottke and Norman, 2017; Gomes et al., 2005; Morbidelli et al., 2012; Zellner, 2017). During this time-period, there is strong evidence that planetary-scale impacts occurred. For example, data from Apollo samples, lunar meteorites, and numerical models support the Giant Impact Hypothesis for the origin of the Earth\u2013Moon system (e.g., Canup, 2012; \u0106uk and Stewart, 2012; Herwartz et al., 2014). Planetary-scale impacts have also been invoked to account for the crustal scale dichotomy between the northern and southern hemispheres on Mars (e.g., Golabek et al., 2011; Marinova et al., 2008), the delivery of water to terrestrial planets from beyond the ice line (e.g., Daly and Schultz, 2018; O'Brien et al., 2014), and the tilted rotation axis of Uranus (Kegerreis et al., 2018; Kurosaki and Inutsuka, 2018). As the formation of igneous rocks during major impact events is ubiquitous (Dence, 1971; Grieve and Cintala, 1992; Osinski et al., 2018; Pierazzo et al., 1997), several workers have proposed that primary impact melts and, to a lesser extent, subsequent adiabatic melting due to uplift and exhumation of lithospheric and mantle rocks from depth, are a major contributor to the formation of early planetary crusts on the terrestrial planets (Elkins-Tanton, 2012; Elkins-Tanton et al., 2004; Grieve et al., 2006; Latypov et al., 2019).\nMotivated by the discovery of extraterrestrial platinum group metals in sedimentary rocks that mark the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (Alvarez et al., 1980), considerable attention has been paid to the destructive environmental effects of impacts and their role in, at least, one of the top five mass extinction event on Earth (e.g., Kring, 2003; Pierazzo and Artemieva, 2012; Schulte et al., 2010). That major impact events can have a deleterious effect on the biosphere, coupled with the high impact rates early in solar system history, have led to the common assertion that impacts would have precluded or extinguished the first attempts at terrestrial life (e.g., Chyba, 1993; Maher and Stevenson, 1988; Sleep et al., 1989). More recently, however, studies have shown that impacts can also be beneficial for life, from delivering and\/or generating many of the necessary chemical ingredients for life to creating habitats for life in the form of hydrothermal systems, crater lakes, and substrates such as glasses, clays, and porous rocks (see recent review by Osinski et al., 2020a). Many of the worlds impact craters are also known to host ore deposits or hydrocarbon reservoirs, such that the beneficial effects of impacts extend from creating conditions suitable to life to economic resources (Grieve, 2012; Reimold et al., 2005).\nIn summary, the impact of extraterrestrial objects with planetary bodies is a fundamental geological and biological process and is one that occurs from the very beginning of the formation and evolution of any solar system. Unfortunately, or fortunately for the survival of humans, the uniformitarian principle that \u201cThe Present Is the Key to the Past\u201d does not hold particularly well for major impacts that are relatively rare stochastic events and for which there is no historically recent large example to study. Our understanding of impact events, therefore, comes primarily from numerical simulations, experiments, satellite and rover observations from other planetary bodies, the study of Apollo samples from the Moon and other extraterrestrial samples in the form of meteorites, as well as the geological record of impact cratering on Earth. Despite the incompleteness of the terrestrial record, with its complications due to overprinting by other terrestrial geological processes, such as erosion, tectonism, etc., the impact cratering record of Earth is critical to our understanding of the processes, products, and effects of impact events. Impact craters on Earth afford the only present opportunity to conduct fieldwork, deep drilling, detailed geophysical surveys, and obtain in situ samples, that are necessary to characterize the nature and properties of the impactites, develop ideas, test hypotheses, and refine our understanding of impact process. In this contribution, we provide an up-to-date review and synthesis of the impact cratering record on Earth through the initiative known as Impact Earth.\nThe goal of the Impact Earth initiative (http:\/\/www.impactearth.com) is to provide a holistic view of impacts, from fireballs, to meteorite falls, to the largest crater-forming events (Osinski and Grieve, 2019). At its core is a new searchable database of all confirmed impact sites on Earth and many of their most salient attributes, such as age, size, etc. This database is provided here in Appendix A and is discussed in subsequent sections. The origin of the Impact Earth Database can be traced back over 65\u00a0years to when the systematic search for impact structures in Canada was initiated in 1955 by Dr. Carlyle S. Beals, who was the Dominion Astronomer at the Dominion Observatory (Ottawa, Canada) at the time. This initial effort was enabled by the first national Canadian aerial photograph campaigns. Some early reports are provided by Beals (1958), Beals et al. (1960), Innes (1964), and Beals (1965), culminating with the publication by Dence (1965) that listed 10 possible Canadian impact structures, all of which were subsequently confirmed. This Canadian-focused effort was subsequently taken up by the Earth Physics Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources in 1970 and expanded to be global in scope, with the first published version being provided by Dence (1972), who listed 63 \u201ccertain (authenticated) meteorite impact craters\u201d; although this represented only 12 separate impact sites, with many (e.g., Henbury, Sikhote Alin) comprising multiple \u201ccraters\u201d, and the largest being the 1.2\u00a0km diameter Barringer or Meteor Crater, USA. Dence (1972) also listed 42 \u201cprobable impact craters\u201d, all but one of which were subsequently confirmed to be of impact origin. It is worth noting that the first published world-wide listing of terrestrial impact structures was by Spencer (1933) who listed \u201cfive more or less certain examples of known meteorite craters\u201d: Barringer, Henbury, Kaali, Odessa, and Wabar. Other early lists were published by Krinov (1963) and Monod (1965).\nOver the course of the next two decades, additional structures were added to the Canadian database, as were other data on their nature and characteristics, and a searchable digital database was created and maintained initially at the Earth Physics Branch and later by the Geophysics Division of the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa from 1986 onwards. Periodic reviews provided updates during this time period and include Grieve et al. (1987), which listed 116 confirmed impact craters, and Grieve (1991) and Grieve and Shoemaker (1994), which listed 130 and 145 confirmed impact structures, respectively. Following the termination of a systematic program of impact research at the Geological Survey of Canada in 1997, the database was transferred to the University of New Brunswick, where an abbreviated version was made public on the internet. A number of individual researchers and citizen scientists have also compiled their own (working) lists of confirmed and possible impact structures (e.g., the recent compilation by Kenkmann, 2021), a few of which were made accessible online at some point in time, but many were not maintained and\/or are no longer available on the internet. The lack of an agreed-upon and consistent set of criteria for confirming an impact site \u2013 which we discuss in Section 4 \u2013 has also led to many of these previous lists in having many ambiguous or suspect entries.\nThe Impact Earth Database we present and review here and that is available at http:\/\/www.impactearth.com is an outgrowth of these earlier Canadian government-led efforts but is a full relational-database, with enhanced available attributes and search capabilities. The starting point of this work was the original database, provided to us by the Geological Survey of Canada. For the first part of this contribution, we assessed this existing database and carried out a comprehensive scoping review (following the recommendations of Par\u00e9 et al. (2015) and references therein) of the literature on all confirmed and potential impact features. For clarity, in Section 2, we discuss what actually constitutes a \u201cmeteorite impact crater\u201d, provide an overview of the impact process (Section 4), and outline the criteria that we used and recommend for how impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters, and impact deposits on Earth are confirmed (Section 4). As there are likely omissions and even errors in this database due to the diversity and breadth of the current literature on terrestrial impacts, we welcome input from the entire community. In the second part of this contribution, we provide a critical review of the Impact Earth Database and discuss weaknesses, contradictions, and inconsistencies in the literature. We provide recommendations as to how to determine important attributes such as age and diameter. For each impact feature, we provide important attributes, including when it was first confirmed as due to impact, age, diameter, level of preservation, and what types of impactites and shock metamorphic features have been reported in the literature.\nOne of our main aims is that the Impact Earth Database will provide an important new resource for researchers interested in impact craters and that it will stimulate future research endeavours. The Impact Earth website (http:\/\/www.impactearth.com) will be a living resource for those who wish to track what has changed over time. We note that we do not cover post-impact processes, such as impact-generated hydrothermal systems (Kirsim\u00e4e and Osinski, 2012; Osinski et al., 2013), the destructive environmental effects (Schulte et al., 2010), or the positive beneficial effects for microbial life (Osinski et al., 2020b) and generation of economic resources (Grieve, 2012; Reimold et al., 2005). Finally, we also acknowledge that the Canadian context is preferentially used here to illustrate some of the properties and challenges of the terrestrial record (e.g., in determining rim diameter, even in relatively fresh structures), which is related to the first two authors having conducted the bulk of their field and laboratory studies at Canadian impact sites.\n\n\n2\nWhat constitutes an impact crater?\nIn the literature, sites proposed to be of extraterrestrial origin are referred to by various terms: \u201ccraters\u201d, \u201cimpact craters\u201d, \u201chypervelocity impact craters\u201d or \u201cmeteorite impact craters\u201d. The first attempt to introduce consistent terminology and a classification scheme for craters was by Krinov (1963) and Dence (1965), and subsequently synthesized by Dence (1972). These authors defined four main types of craters: 1) Impact pits formed by meteorites that remain intact; 2) Impact craters formed by meteorites that break up and deform but the target materials are not subjected to shock metamorphism; 3) Simple hypervelocity craters, comprising uplifted and overturned rim rocks, a breccia lens, but most importantly, evidence of shock metamorphism in the target materials; and 4) Complex hypervelocity craters that are relatively shallow with respect to their depth-diameter ration, with a central uplifted area and slumped or depressed rim structure.\n\nSt\u00f6ffler and Grieve (2007) also noted that the term \u201cimpact\u201d should more correctly be \u201chypervelocity impact\u201d, defined as \u201cthe collision of two (planetary) bodies at or near cosmic velocity, which causes the propagation of a shock wave in both the impactor and target body (Melosh, 1989)\u201d. The key defining factor then is shock metamorphism, which refers to material engulfed by and, therefore, affected by the passage of a shock wave (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). The problem arises with the use of the term \u201cimpact crater\u201d, without the prefix \u201chypervelocity\u201d. To some, the terms \u201cimpact crater\u201d and \u201chypervelocity impact crater\u201d may be interchangeable. For example, French, in his book Traces of Catastrophe, writes that \u201cthe general term \u2018impact crater\u2019 is used here to designate a hypervelocity impact crater\u201d (French, 1998). This definition is not the same as Dence (1972), who explicitly stated that \u201cimpact craters\u201d do not form through the passage of a shock wave and are not hypervelocity in origin. French (1998) then refers to pits as low-velocity impacts, forming craters typically less than a few 10s m in diameter. Importantly, pits do not form from hypervelocity impact and shock metamorphism does not occur in the target rocks or impactor.\n\nTable 1\n provides definitions of the terminology used in this review and the Impact Earth database and website. Importantly, most terrestrial impact sites, both impact craters and hypervelocity impact craters, are eroded to some degree such that the original crater-form is modified or even no longer present. As such, the term impact structure as a general term is preferred for most terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters, except in the rare cases where the original crater morphology is preserved.\n\n\n3\nThe impact cratering process\nTens to hundreds of metric tons of material from space is acquired by the Earth every day. The bulk of this material is micrometer to mm size and disintegrates and\/or melts in atmosphere. On planetary bodies that lack an atmosphere, such as the Moon, this material does impact the surface, forming microcraters and is the dominant process causing erosion of exposed lunar rock surfaces (H\u00f6rz et al., 1971). Centimeter- to m-size objects (i.e., meteoroids) that are coherent enough and can survive atmospheric passage and make it to the Earth's surface intact are termed meteorites. During passage through the Earth's atmosphere, these meteoroids leave visible paths in the form of meteors or \u201cshooting stars\u201d. A fireball is an unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of \u22124 or brighter (American Meteor Society, 2022). As discussed in the previous section, large meteorites can penetrate some distance into the surface of the target materials to form impact pits (Table 1), where the pit is only slightly larger than the meteorite itself. An example of one of the largest impact pits is one formed by the Sterlitamak IIIAB iron meteorite in 1990 in Russia, where a 315\u00a0kg meteorite with dimensions 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a045\u00a0\u00d7\u00a028\u00a0cm was found within a 10\u00a0m diameter pit at 12\u00a0m depth (Petaev, 1992). Meteorites, even those that form m-size impact pits, will have lost most or all of their original velocity and kinetic energy by atmospheric retardation and suffered some degree of disintegration and ablation (French, 1998).\nIn some cases, for example the 1908 Tunguska (Vasilyev, 1998) and the more recent 2013 Chelyabinsk (Brown et al., 2013) events, extraterrestrial objects in the m- to few 10s m size range can be completely disrupted during passage through the Earth's atmosphere and explode at heights that can affect the Earth's surface. It is becoming increasingly apparent that such events, referred to interchangeably as airbursts, aerial bursts, or bolides, are common and pose significant threats to humans. The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages an up-to-date database of all fireballs (reported by US government sensors) since 1988. Ground- and satellite-based observations combined with theoretical calculations of airbursts suggest that the Earth is struck annually by a objects with energies equivalent to 2\u201310 kt TNT equivalent, with Tunguska-size events occurring once every 1000\u00a0years (Brown et al., 2002). Wasson (2003) further suggested that airbursts larger than Tunguska must surely have occurred throughout geological time. The issue is that such events are predicted to not form craters or leave other clear and long-lasting signs on the Earth surface, so they are hard to identify and confirm. Numerical modelling by Boslough and Crawford (2008) suggests that during large low-altitude airbursts, a high-temperature jet is formed that, if it makes contact with the Earth's surface, will expand radially outwards in the form of a fireball. Pressures are insufficient to produce shock metamorphism in surface materials; however, temperatures exceed the melting temperatures of silicate minerals which, following rapid quenching, will create abundant glass deposits that may be preserved in the geological record (Boslough and Crawford, 2008).\nIf the extraterrestrial object \u2013 i.e., an asteroid or comet \u2013 is large enough to pass through the atmosphere with little to no deceleration, it impacts the Earth's surface at a combination of its original cosmic velocity (i.e., the velocity at which an object is moving through space) and the Earth's escape velocity, generating a shock wave and forming a hypervelocity impact crater. For Earth, the minimum impact velocity for the formation of a hypervelocity impact crater is 11.2\u00a0km\/s, which is the escape velocity of our planet. Average impact velocities, however, are substantially higher, with ~18\u00a0km\/s for asteroids and\u00a0~\u00a030\u201350\u00a0km\/s for comets. Such extreme velocities translates into staggeringly high amount of kinetic energy deposited into the Earth's crust. Taking the average impact velocity for an asteroid (~18\u00a0km\/s), a 45o impact angle (the most likely), and assuming projectile and target densities of 3000\u00a0kg\/m3, 100\u00a0m and 1\u00a0km-diameter projectiles release ~1017 and 1020\u00a0J, respectively, and produce craters ~1.1\u00a0km and 13.8\u00a0km in diameter, respectively (Collins et al., 2005). For comparison, the largest earthquake ever recorded (i.e., the M9.5 1960 Chile earthquake) and the largest known volcanic eruptions (e.g., the explosive ~27\u00a0Ma La Garita Caldera eruption and largest single Colombia River basalt lava flows at ~15\u00a0Ma), released energies of the order of 1019\u00a0J (Gudmundsson, 2014). The formation of a hypervelocity impact crater is, in addition, further unlike any other endogenic geological process (Fig. 1\n), due to the extreme pressures (100\u00a0s and likely exceeding 1000\u00a0GPa; cf., the pressure at the centre of the Earth of ~360\u00a0GPa) and temperatures (10,000\u00a0s oC; cf., the temperature at the centre of the Earth of ~6000\u00a0\u00b0C), their virtually instantaneous nature (i.e., seconds to minutes), the extreme strain rates involved (~104 to 106\u00a0s\u22121; cf., the average geological strain rates of ~10\u221214 (Fagereng and Biggs, 2019)), and the fact that this energy is released at an essentially single location on the Earth's surface.\nThe formation of a hypervelocity impact crater has historically been considered to encompass three main stages (Ahrens and O'Keefe, 1977; Gault et al., 1968; Melosh, 1989) (Fig. 2\n): (1) contact and compression, (2) excavation, and (3) modification. This adequately conveys the formation of hypervelocity impact craters, but does not convey the significant impact-induced processes, environmental, and geological effects, that may continue for thousands to millions of years after the impact event. Such post-impact stages and processes are beyond the scope of this contribution, but include the hydrothermal phase, where impact-generated hydrothermal systems and crater lakes can develop, the post-impact succession phase, and the ecological assimilation phase (Osinski et al., 2020c).\nThe so-called thermobaric phase of an impact event is when the hypervelocity impact crater is formed (Osinski et al., 2020c), comprising the three formation stages listed above. Details of the physics of crater formation are given in Melosh (1989) and are only presented here in narrative form. Crater formation begins with the initial contact and compression stage (Fig. 2a), when the impactor contacts the surface of the target, and ends, when the shock compression of the impactor has been completely unloaded (i.e., it is vaporized, melted, and\/or ejected from the cavity). During this stage, the impactor penetrates ~1\u20132 times its diameter into the target rocks and transfers its considerable kinetic energy to the target rocks. Shock waves are generated at the target-impactor interface and propagate both into the target rocks and back into the impactor. The \u201cfree\u201d upper surface of the impactor cannot be subjected to compression and, thus, the shock wave is reflected back into the impactor as a rarefaction or tensional wave (Ahrens and O'Keefe, 1972). It is the passage of this rarefaction wave through the impactor that causes it to unload from high shock pressures. Under shock compression, there is considerable pressure-volume work performed within the target rocks and their internal energy is increased. If porosity is present in the target rocks (e.g., in most sedimentary rocks) the pores are closed by relatively low shock pressures (G\u00fcldemeister et al., 2013; Kieffer et al., 1976; W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2008). As with the impactor, shock pressures cannot be maintained at the free surface of the target rocks and a rarefaction wave propagates into the shock compressed target rocks. This combination of the shock and rarefaction waves in the target materials ultimately results in shock metamorphism (Fig. 1) of target rocks and the production of distinctive shock metamorphic effects, which are discussed in detail in Section 4. It is notable that the pressure\u2013temperature space in which shock metamorphism occurs is distinctly different from any form of endogenic metamorphism (Fig. 1). On decompression by the rarefaction wave, not all the pressure-volume work due to shock compression is recovered. The unrecovered pressure-volume work that remains is expressed as waste heat, which can result in the melting (see review by Osinski et al., 2018) and, even, vaporization of the impactor and a portion of the target rocks (Melosh, 1989) (Fig. 1).\nDuring the subsequent excavation stage, the kinetic energy imparted to the target rocks by the interaction of the shock and rarefaction waves leads to particle velocities in the target rocks, with trajectories that define an \u201cexcavation flow-field\u201d (Fig. 2b). This flow-field, combined with downward and outward physical compression of the target rocks, result in the formation of a so-called \u201ctransient cavity\u201d. It is important to note that the transient cavity is a conceptual construct and only exists as a physical entity in the smallest of impacts. Fig. 1b, which shows the concept of a transient cavity, can be regarded as a provenance map for what happens to the target rocks and where they end up (Dence, 1968; Grieve and Cintala, 1981). This figure illustrates the consequence of the different trajectories of target rocks, which results in the division of the transient cavity into an upper \u201cexcavated zone\u201d and a lower \u201cdisplaced zone\u201d (Fig. 2b). During the excavation stage, material in the upper zone, comprising a mixture of fragmented target rocks with varying proportions of impact melt, is ejected ballistically beyond the transient cavity rim to form the continuous ejecta blanket (Oberbeck, 1975). A portion of the melt and fragmented target rock mixture that originates beneath the point of impact is deflected upwards and outwards parallel to the base of the transient cavity, but must travel further and possesses less kinetic energy than material in the excavated zone, so that ejection is not achieved (Grieve et al., 1977) (Fig. 2b). This material remains in the transient cavity into the modification stage (Figs. 2c, d). The end of the excavation stage is the point in time when motions associated with the passage of the shock and rarefaction waves can no longer excavate or displace target rocks and melt (Fig. 2c). As noted below, however, the excavation and modification stages may begin and end at different times in different parts of the transient cavity and these two stages can overlap in time, particularly in larger craters.\nTowards the end of the excavation stage, however, the next stage of the cratering process is determined by the scale of the impact event, through a combination of the size of the transient cavity, planetary gravity and, and to a lesser extent, by the strength of the target rocks. Below a certain size, the transient cavity is only mildly unstable, and the third and final modification stage involves only inward collapse and slumping of the transient cavity wall, and a simple hypervelocity impact crater is formed (Fig. 3a). Simple hypervelocity impact craters comprise a bowl-shaped cavity, with an uplifted and commonly overturned rim or \u201cflap\u201d that approximates the transient cavity rim (Fig. 2e). The overturned flap is overlain by allochthonous impact ejecta deposits and the crater interior is partially filled, to approximately half the depth of the original transient cavity, with crater-fill impactites largely derived from the inward collapse of a portion of the transient cavity wall. The term \u201cimpactite\u201d is \u201ca collective term for all rocks affected by one or more hypervelocity impact(s) resulting from collision(s) of planetary bodies\u201d and comprises three main classes of rocks: shocked rocks, impact melt rocks, and impact breccias (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). Studies at the Barringer and Brent simple craters demonstrate that the crater-fill impactites in simple craters is mostly impact breccia with overall low shock levels, consistent with an origin via slumping of the (low shock) transient cavity walls (Grieve and Cintala, 1981), intermixed with volumetrically relatively small lenses and zones of more highly shocked and shock melted material that originated closer to the point of impact and lined the floor and walls of the transient cavity, prior to the collapse of the cavity walls.\nAbove a certain threshold size, the transient cavity is considerably more unstable and the modification stage drastically changes the character of the final crater, producing so-called complex hypervelocity impact craters (e.g., Fig. 3b). The actual transition diameter from simple to complex hypervelocity impact craters on the terrestrial planets is approximately inversely proportional to the gravitational acceleration (g) of a given planet (Pike, 1980). Historically, the simple to complex transition diameter for the Moon was proposed to occur at ~19\u00a0km (Pike, 1977), but more recent analyses using higher-resolution imagery and elevation data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission place the transition diameter at ~20\u00a0km for highland craters and\u00a0~\u00a018\u00a0km for mare craters (Kr\u00fcger et al., 2018). On Earth, the transition has been cited traditionally as occurring at ~2\u00a0km for craters in sedimentary and\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0km in crystalline targets, respectively (Dence, 1972) \u2013 we revisit these transition diameters for terrestrial craters in Section 9.1.\nDuring the modification stage in complex craters, the originally bowl-shaped transient cavity is modified by two competing processes (Figs. 2c \u2013 e); uplift of the floor of the transient cavity floor in the center of the cavity and the complete downward and inward collapse of the rim area. In larger craters, this structural uplift can occur before excavation ceases at the outer reaches of the transient cavity and can also overshoot above the original target surface and then collapse back downwards and outwards (Fig. 2d). It is also important to note that the transition from simple to complex crater morphologies is not abrupt. For example, there is a group of so-called transitional impact craters on the Moon that range from 15 to 42\u00a0km in diameter. Such transitional craters comprise a relatively flat crater floor instead of the bowl-shaped form of simple craters, possesses one or more discrete terrace and\/or rock slides, but lack an emergent topographic structural uplift (Osinski et al., 2019).\nOn the Moon and other planetary bodies with well-preserved craters, the structural uplift is manifest as a topographic central peak (Fig. 3b), or cluster of peaks, that rises above the surrounding crater-fill deposits. With increasing crater diameter on the Moon (~200\u00a0km), a peak ring structure appears in addition to the central peak, forming proto-basins or central-peak basins (Pike and Spudis, 1987). At even larger diameters, central peaks are no longer visible and peak-ring basins (>300\u00a0km diameter) (Fig. 3c) and eventually multi-ring basins (>600\u00a0km diameter) (Fig. 3d) form, which comprise two or more concentric topographic rings, respectively (Hartmann and Kuiper, 1962). At terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters the original topography and morphology of the centrally uplifted region is typically not preserved due to erosion, and the generic term structural uplift is preferred (Grieve et al., 1981). However, as discussed in Section 9.3., the central uplifts of terrestrial complex impact craters appear to be more subdued in their morphology and morphometry and may never have looked like fresh lunar complex craters.\nThe second major process occurring during the modification stage in complex craters is the inward and initially downward collapse of the transient cavity walls (Fig. 2d). In fresh planetary craters, the rim region comprises a series of fault-bounded terraces (Fig. 3b). Field studies of craters on Earth reveal the degree of structural complexity that is typically hidden from view in remote-sensed data on fresh planetary craters. These terrestrial studies show that crater collapse occurs along a series of interconnected faults, oriented both radially and concentrically to the point of impact (Kenkmann et al., 2014); concentric faults are often listric in nature and can be oriented both inwards and outwards (Osinski and Spray, 2005). Radial faults accommodate movement along concentric faults and deformation is also accommodated via radially and concentrically-oriented fold structures (Kenkmann et al., 2014; Kenkmann and von Dalwigk, 2000; Osinski and Spray, 2005). Due to these considerably more substantial modification processes, complex craters have smaller depth-diameter ratios than simple craters, typically ~1:10 to 1:20 for lunar craters (Pike, 1977). For complex craters, the modification stage is the longest stage in the impact cratering process, approaching a few minutes in duration in the largest impacts (Melosh, 1989).\nAs noted above, throughout the modification stage, the transient cavity is lined by a melt and fragmented target rock mixture that was not ejected during the excavation stage (Figs. 2c, d). Due to the dynamic nature of the modification stage, this material can undergo significant transport during this final stage of formation of complex craters. A portion of this material remains within the interior of the final crater, forming crater-fill deposits (Figs. 2e, 4b). Such crater-fill impactites in complex craters formed in crystalline target rocks are dominated by impact melt rocks and melt-bearing breccias (Grieve and Therriault, 2012). Observations of terrestrial and planetary craters also reveal that a portion of this material is transported as ground-hugging flows during modification stage outwards beyond the transient and final crater rims in a second major phase of ejecta emplacement (Hawke and Head, 1977; Osinski et al., 2011). In complex craters, the transient cavity is essentially collapsed and destroyed during the modification stage. As a result, ejecta deposits occur both within the final crater, in regions which were exterior to the initial transient cavity, but are now interior to the final crater rim, and in regions exterior to the final crater rim (Fig. 2e). The end of the modification stage equates to the point in time where all major transport and movement of target material as the result of the deposition of the kinetic energy of the impactor ceases. The modification of terrestrial craters through post-impact isostatic and structural readjustment, particularly movement along the major faults, can continue for geologically significant time after the initial impact event, particularly if there is subsequent tectonic activity.\n\n\n4\nCriteria required to confirm impact events\n\n4.1\nA historical perspective\nThroughout the 19th century, the increasing recognition of meteorites led to a growing appreciation that extraterrestrial objects can strike Earth (see Marvin, 2006, and references therein). In 1891, the discovery of the Ca\u00f1on Diablo iron meteorite \u201cnear the base of a nearly circular elevation, which was known locally as \u201cCrater Mountain\u201d in northern Arizona (Foote, 1891), marked the beginning of the debate as to the origin of the structure we now know as Meteor or Barringer Crater. At about the same time, Gilbert (1893) proposed the impact origin for lunar craters. Three years later, Gilbert (in)famously concluded that this same crater in Arizona, which he referred to by its more official local name of Coon Mountain or Coon Butte, was not of extraterrestrial origin (Gilbert, 1896). It wasn't until a few years later that Daniel M. Barringer, a mining engineer and businessman, first proposed an impact origin for this structure, making the connection between the presence of iron meteorites and a crater (Barringer, 1905).\nFor the subsequent few decades after the recognition of Meteor or Barringer Crater, only the presence of meteorite fragments was deemed as evidence for an impact event. There were, however, researchers suggesting the impact origin of other structures in the absence of meteoritic fragments. A notable early example is Spencer (1933), who recognized the link between circular topographic depressions and the presence of meteoritic material and unusual silica glasses at the Odessa craters in Texas (Barringer, 1928), the Henbury crater field in Australia (Alderman, 1932), Kaali in Estonia (Reinwald, 1939), and the Wabar craters in Saudi Arabia (Philby, 1933). The author appears to also have been the first to suggest the impact origin of Campo del Cielo craters in Argentina.\n\nBoon and Albritton (1936) built upon the observations of Spencer (1933) and hypothesized that given the presence of larger multi-km size impact craters on the Moon that the same should be the case for the Earth. These authors were among the earliest to suggest the impact origin of larger structures that lacked meteorite fragments. Their descriptions of circular structures with central uplifted areas surrounding downfaulted rocks and a rim comprising outward dipping layers essentially describes what we now know as complex impact structures. These authors appear to have also been the first to make the connection to so-called \u201ccryptovolcanic structures\u201d on Earth. Boon and Albritton (1936) noted \u201ccryptovolcanic structures\u201d possessed a circular outline, a central uplift, set in a larger exterior down-faulted area and evidence for \u201cviolent action\u201d. The term \u201ccryptovolcanic\u201d was first used to describe what is now known as the Steinheim impact crater in Germany (Branco and Fraas, 1905). Bucher (1936) described several similar \u201ccryptovolcanic structures\u201d in the USA, and defined them as \u201cdisturbances produced by the explosive release of gases under high tension, without the extrusion of any magmatic material, at locations where there had previously been no volcanic activity\u201d. Boon and Albritton (1936) concluded that \u201cthat some of the structures which have been assigned to volcanic origin are equally as well interpreted as meteorite structures\u201d. All but one of the cryptovolcanic structures they cited, as reported by Bucher (1936), were subsequently confirmed as complex hypervelocity impact structures: Decaturville, Flynn Creek, Kentland, Serpent Mound, Upheaval Dome, and Wells Creek. The one structure not currently confirmed is Jeptha Knob, but its impact origin remains a possibility (Cressman, 1981; Fox, 2014; Seeger, 1968) (see Section 4.4. for further discussion). Similarly, Fredriksson and Wickman (1963) suggested that 5 unusual geological structures in Sweden (Dellen, Hummeln, Mien, Siljan, and Tv\u00e4ren) were possible \u201cfossil astroblemes\u201d; all of these were subsequently confirmed as hypervelocity impact structures.\nThe presence of meteoritic fragments, however, remained the only widely accepted diagnostic criterion to confirm an impact event until the early 1970s. Indeed, as noted above, in his compilation of known impact craters, Dence (1972) listed only 12 \u201ccertain (authenticated) meteorite impact craters\u201d (Aouelloul, Barringer, Boxhole, Campo del Cielo, Dalgaranga, Haviland, Henbury, Ka\u00e4lijarvi, Odessa, Sikhote Alin, Wabar, Wolfe Creek), all, except one (Aouelloul) were confirmed by the presence of meteorite fragments. Dence (1972) did provide a list of 42 \u201cprobable impact craters\u201d, many of which were previously interpreted as \u201ccryptovolcanic structures\u201d, based on \u201cpossible\u201d evidence for shock metamorphism. While some early workers did suggest a link between what are now known as shock metamorphic features and impact events, most notably Robert Dietz and his pioneering recognition of shatter cones (Dietz, 1946, 1947), the occurrence of shock metamorphism was not generally recognized until the 1960s. This represented a paradigm shift in the understanding and recognition of meteorite impact craters.\nThe first study, to our knowledge, to recognize microscopic planar microstructures or lamellae in quartz that we now refer to as planar fractures (PFs) and planar deformation features (PDFs) was by McIntyre (1962) in an abstract presented at the First Western National Meeting of the American Geophysical Union held in December 1961 \u2013 and later published in McIntyre (1968). Carter (1965) provided one of the first peer-reviewed articles to document planar microstructures in quartz, based on studies of samples from Barringer Crater and the West Clearwater Lake and Vredefort impact structures. St\u00f6ffler (1966) also documented PFs and PDFs at the Ries impact structure and was one of the first studies to document increasing levels of shock toward the point of impact. Another early report was by Chao (1967), who studied samples from the confirmed craters Aouelloul, Barringer, Henbury, Wabar, and the suspected craters of Bosumtwi and Ries, who documented PFs and PDFs in quartz, so-called diaplectic glass, whole rock glass, and the high-pressure polymorphs coesite and stishovite. This publication built upon the landmark conference \u201cShock Metamorphism of Natural Materials\u201d that was held at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, USA, April 14\u201316, 1966. The conference proceedings published two years later (French and Short, 1968) cover a wide variety of topics on shock metamorphism, many of which are still considered ground-breaking. Despite the overwhelming evidence that shock metamorphic features, such as PDFs in quartz and shatter cones, can only be formed from hypervelocity impact, there were proponents that clung to the idea of a cryptovolcanic origin. For example, in Canada, the Manicouagan (Currie, 1972), Mistastin Lake (Currie, 1971), Slate Islands (Sage, 1978), and West Clearwater (Bostock, 1969) impact structures were variably referred to as resurgent cryptovolcanic calderas and diatremes. Even more recently, Nicolaysen and Ferguson (1990) continued to espouse the hypothesis of cryptoexplosion craters, proposing that several well-known impact structures (e.g., Brent, Crooked Creek, Charlevoix, Vredefort, etc.) were formed from the explosive venting of fluids associated with alkaline ultramafic magmas.\n\n\n4.2\nThe current perspective\nAs discussed in Section 2, the presence of meteorite fragments cannot be used to differentiate between impact pits and very small impact craters. As such, the presence of meteorite fragments can only be used to confirm an impact crater (see Table 1 for definition). In addition, there are no impact structures that have been confirmed solely by the presence of the geochemical or isotopic traces of an impactor, although it has been extremely useful in building the case for the impact origin for several structures and impact deposits, including many of the Archean spherule layers (Simonson and Glass, 2004). It was also the initial identification of extraterrestrial platinum group metals in sedimentary rocks that mark the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (Alvarez et al., 1980) that initiated the search for the source impact crater of that age, which proved to be the Chicxulub impact structure, Mexico (Hildebrand et al., 1991). The presence of the chemical or isotopic traces of extraterrestrial objects also remains an important tool used to confirm the impact origin of deposits in the geological record, for which the source crater is unknown. This is particularly important for the origin of extensive spherule beds in the Phanerozoic and Precambrian record (Glass and Simonson, 2012) (see also Section 5.4. below). For a review of the various extraterrestrial chemical and isotopic tracers and their utility, the reader is referred to Goderis et al. (2012).\nThus, given the defining characteristic of hypervelocity impact being the passage of a shock wave through the target rocks (see Section 2.1; cf., Melosh, 1989; St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007), the confirmation of a hypervelocity impact crater can only be achieved through the identification of \u201cshock-metamorphic effects\u201d or \u201cshock effects\u201d in rocks and minerals. As shown in Fig. 1, shock metamorphic effects occupy a distinctly different pressure\u2013temperature space than any form of endogenic metamorphism. These interchangeable terms cover all types of solid state shock-induced changes to minerals and rocks, including phase transformations, but not melting. It is outside the scope of this contribution to provide a comprehensive treatise of shock metamorphism and the reader is referred to reviews by French and Koeberl (2010) and Ferri\u00e8re and Osinski (2012). Table 2\n provides an overview of the criterion that we propose can be used to unambiguously confirm a hypervelocity impact crater or impact deposit. Our synthesis builds upon the review by French and Koeberl (2010), with the addition of more recently discovered and\/or accepted diagnostic shock effects, most notably reidite, former reidite in granular neoblasts (FRIGN) zircon, and so-called feather features (FF).\nReidite, the tetragonal high-pressure polymorph (scheelite-type structure) of zircon (ZrSiO4), is now accepted as a diagnostic indicator of impact cratering (Rochette et al., 2019; Wittmann et al., 2006). It has only been replicated in shock experiments at pressures >32\u00a0GPa (Fiske et al., 1994), which is a condition that only occurs in crustal material during hypervelocity impacts. Reidite has been identified in impactite samples from only a handful of impact structures (e.g., Xiuyan (Chen et al., 2013), Ries (Gucsik et al., 2004), Chesapeake Bay (Glass and Liu, 2001), and the impact deposit at Stac Fada (Reddy et al., 2015)), and is considered a rare shock mineral (Wittmann et al., 2006). Recent studies have reported a new indicator termed \u201cformer reidite in granular neoblasts\u201d or FRIGN zircon, which records both high-pressure and high-temperature conditions (Cavosie et al., 2018c). These granular zircons exhibit orientation relations that indicate a transformation and reversion process from zircon to reidite and back to zircon (Cavosie et al., 2016, 2018c; Rochette et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021). For this to occur, the zircon grain would need to experience pressure conditions >30\u00a0GPa, followed by post-shock temperatures >1200\u00a0\u00b0C; although some studies (Kovaleva et al., 2021) suggest that FRIGN zircon may be also a result of a rapid crystallization from the melt.\nFeather features are microstructures formed in quartz that are short (typically <100\u00a0\u03bcm) thinly spaced (2\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm) parallel to subparallel lamellae branching off of a PF (Fig. 6b). They were first described as \u201cfeather features\u201d (FF) by French and Cordua (1999); although the earliest descriptions seem to be in Carter (1968) and in Robertson et al. (1968). Both PFs and FFs have measurable crystallographic orientation, with these three being most common: (0001), {\n10\n\n1\n\u00af\n\n1\n}, and {\n11\n\n2\n\u00af\n\n2\n}. Poelchau and Kenkmann (2011) found them to form in pressure range\u00a0~\u00a07\u201310\u00a0GPa, which makes them particularly useful at the lower end of the shock scale.\nAs noted in Section 3, a distinctive characteristic of impact events is the melting of target rocks and the production of a range of glassy to crystalline igneous rocks and breccias (see review by Osinski et al., 2018). High-temperature glasses and melts are often considered diagnostic of hypervelocity impact (e.g., French and Koeberl, 2010). Common products include lechatelierite (pure SiO2 glass) formed by melting of quartz at temperatures \u22651750\u00a0\u00b0C (Grieve et al., 1996) and MgO and CaO-rich (up to 20\u201330\u00a0wt%) silicate glasses formed through the impact melting of carbonates (Osinski and Spray, 2001). Other examples include the melting of accessory minerals such as titanite, which requires temperatures of >1380\u00a0\u00b0C (Hayward and Cecchetto, 1982), the decomposition of zircon to baddeleyite, which occurs at >1850\u00a0\u00b0C (Timms et al., 2017a), and the transformation of baddeleyite (monoclinic-zirconia) to cubic zirconia, which occurs at temperatures >2370\u00a0\u00b0C (Timms et al., 2017b). However, these impact products are not produced directly by high shock pressures and are, therefore, not actually \u201cdiagnostic\u201d of shock, even if it was high shock pressures that resulted in the high temperatures. Thus, while their presence can help to infer the presence of a hypervelocity impact crater, high-temperature glasses and melts alone cannot be used to confirm such a feature.\n\n\n4.3\nThe challenge of small craters\nAs discussed in Section 4.2., the confirmation of a hypervelocity impact crater requires the identification of \u201cshock-metamorphic effects\u201d or \u201cshock effects\u201d in rocks and minerals. Unfortunately, in the case of very small impact craters (<100\u2013200\u00a0m diameter), the affected volume of target rocks is usually very limited and later distributed over a large surface area. For example, during the formation of the largest Morasko craters (~100\u00a0m in diameter) ~1000\u00a0m3 was shocked above 5\u00a0GPa, ~300\u00a0m3 above 10\u00a0GPa, and\u00a0~\u00a01\u00a0m3 (if any) was shocked above 30\u00a0GPa (Bronikowska et al., 2017). As a result, a year's long hunt for grains with planar deformation features (requiring >10\u201330\u00a0GPa) was unsuccessful (A. Muszynski, pers. comm., 2021). Experimental impacts into (unconsolidated) quartz sand showed that material with even modest signs of shock-affected material forms up to ~0.15% of proximal ejecta (and up to 2.5% of material lining up the inside of the crater) (W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2016). These values represent the absolute upper limit of the melted\/shocked material because: 1) experiments were performed at higher velocities than expected for a formation of most terrestrial craters <100\u00a0m in diameter), and 2) because of the selected experimental setup (shocked particles were approximated by the weight percent of particles with different than initial grain sizes most of the increase in particle size was due to gluing of the quartz grains by the shock melted plastic and aluminium impactors). In the paper the presence of PDFs was reported, but not illustrated on any of the photos, and their abundance was not provided.\nAdditionally, highly porous, and unconsolidated materials respond differently to the passage of shock waves than non-porous materials. The target porosity reduces crater volumes and cratering efficiency relative to nonporous rocks to 20\u201340% of the expected nonporous volume (Poelchau et al., 2013). This effect is caused by shock wave energy being absorbed by crushing of pore space, leading to a faster decay of the shock wave, but also leading increasing post-shock temperatures (Kieffer, 1971). As a result, most very small impact craters are not associated with identified shock metamorphic effects. Indeed, as discussed in Sections 2 and 4.1, the main, and in most cases only, recognition criteria applied to small impact craters (<100\u2013200\u00a0m diameter) is finding meteorite fragments. All 14 known Holocene-age impact craters smaller than 200\u00a0m in diameter are identified based on association with meteorite fragments. Eight of them are confirmed solely based on the presence of meteorite fragments (Haviland, Dalgaranga, Whitecourt, Campo del Cielo, Veevers, Morasko, Kaali and Boxhole). A formation of two was witnessed (Sikhote Alin in 1947 and Carancas in 2007). Two other cases (Odessa and Henbury) are also associated with the presence of melt. However, distinguishing impact melts from some atypical wildfire melts is challenging (Roperch et al., 2017; Schultz et al., 2004, 2014). Only two sites (Kamil and Wabar) are characterized by the presence of unequivocal shock metamorphic indicators (PDFs in quartz) that are required to confirm hypervelocity impact craters, and out of those two only Wabar is thought to be formed in unconsolidated materials (Gnos et al., 2013).\nAll, except one, of the meteorites associated with very small impact craters are irons or stony irons (except the witnessed, somehow atypical case of Carancas, in Peru, formed by the fall of a stony meteorite). This can be explained either by stony meteorites not forming very small impact craters because they disintegrate and decelerate during their atmospheric passage (Artemieva and Shuvalov, 2019; Bland and Artemieva, 2006), or by our inability to find stony meteorites associated with impact craters. Challenges with finding stony meteorites near impact sites may be explained by the meteorite survival and\/or the difficulty of finding fragments. First, stony meteorites are much weaker than iron ones and rarely survive atmospheric passage in large enough pieces to form a true impact structure (Bland and Artemieva, 2006). Until 2007, it was assumed that small impact sites cannot be formed by stony asteroids, but due to the witnessed formation of Carancas crater in 2007 by the impact of an H4\u20135 ordinary chondrite (Kenkmann et al., 2009) this opinion has changed. If the event had not been observed and the structure was discovered years later, it would have been very difficult, or even impossible, to find fragments of the Carancas meteorite because the impactor was fragmented into very small pieces during its atmospheric passage and impact: the largest found piece was only 350\u00a0g.\nAdditionally, weathering unevenly affects different types of meteorites. Iron meteorites tend to quickly develop an oxide and hydroxide weathering crust around them that effectively seals the inside from deeper water penetration \u2013 this mechanism is quite efficient in significantly limiting further damage (Muszynski et al., 2012). Due to this, the oldest known non-Antarctic meteorites are iron meteorites, with terrestrial exposure ages of up to 2.7\u00a0Ma (Jull, 2001). Stony meteorites (especially those containing significant amount of Fe-Ni alloy) weather quickly, particularly in contact with water. Weathering-produced minerals such as Fe oxides and hydroxides as well as quickly forming sulphates (Jull et al., 1988) have a higher volume than the original phases, which leads to rock disintegration and further acceleration of weathering. In desert conditions, fragments can be identifiable for ~50\u00a0ka, and rare examples can survive for ~1\u00a0Ma (Jull, 2001). In humid climates, even hundreds of years can be long enough to change chondrites into undistinguishable piles of rusty rocks. Pieces of achondrites can be nearly as resistant to weathering as terrestrial rocks, but once they lose the fusion crust, they may be very hard to recognise from the surrounding material (especially in the post-glacial areas where a wide variety of rock types are present). This may potentially explain the formation of Ilumetsa (Losiak et al., 2020) and Sobolev (Khryanina, 1981) structures that have properties consistent with them being formed by an impact of an asteroid, but where no clear signs of extraterrestrial material was identified. Currently both of those features are classified as potential impact craters (see section 5.3).\n\n\n4.4\nThe question of context\nThe recent discovery of the Hiawatha impact structure in Greenland (Kj\u00e6r et al., 2018) highlights a potential quandary in identifying specific impact structures. In this case, there is evidence of a very circular topographic depression, with no indication for volcanism, but the structure is completely buried underneath the Hiawatha Glacier. The evidence for impact comes from PDFs in quartz grains that are not in situ but were collected from a glacial outwash plain that originates and\/or flows through the crater feature. However, the confirmation of an impact crater based on shock effects in a sample that was not collected in situ is not unique. An excellent analogy to Hiawatha is the Mj\u00f8lnir impact structure in the Barents Sea. This ~40\u00a0km structure is buried by ~400\u00a0m of sediment and lies at a water depth of 350\u2013400\u00a0m and is, thus, inaccessible for direct study, like Hiawatha. Originally suggested to be of impact origin based purely on extensive geophysical data (Gudlaugsson, 1993), its impact origin was subsequently confirmed based on the detection of PDFs in quartz grains in ejecta-bearing strata ~30\u00a0km NNE of the structure \u201cwithin a stratigraphic interval corresponding to the seismically defined deformation event at Mj\u00f8lnir\u201d (Dypvik et al., 1996). In situ sampling has since taken place through drilling of the central uplift and confirmed the occurrence of shock metamorphism (Sandbakken et al., 2005).\nIn addition, there are several well-known and long-confirmed impact structures in Canada, where, despite being exposed, the shock metamorphic evidence for impact comes solely from glacial cobbles, boulders, and moraines, e.g., Lac Couture (Beals et al., 1967), La Moinerie (Gold et al., 1978), Pingualuit (New Quebec) (Meen, 1957), Pilot (Dence et al., 1968), and Wanipitei (Dence and Popelar, 1972). In all of these instances, the glacial float is linked to roughly circular lakes and\/or more irregularly shaped lakes with sub-circular structures revealed via bathymetry. There are other examples in Fennoscandinavia, including Hummeln (Alwmark et al., 2015) and Mien (Svensson and Wickman, 1965), another region that has been heavily glaciated. In summary, the samples in which shock metamorphic criteria are determined need not be in situ, as long as there is a clear topographic crater form and evidence (e.g., glacial flow directions) to connect the two.\n\n\n4.5\nOutstanding questions and challenges in confirming impact craters\nIn general, the more a structure has undergone erosion, the more difficult it is to confirm an impact origin. Topography, a key initial indicator of a potential impact crater, is the first attribute to be modified (e.g., Fig. 4c). In addition, the main reservoir of shocked materials is the crater-fill and ejecta deposits (Fig. 5\n). These allochthonous impactites record shock effects over a large range in pressures and temperatures up to, and including, whole rock glasses and impact melt rocks. Once these deposits are gone, which is the case for many terrestrial craters (see Section 10), there are two other \u201creservoirs\u201d of shocked material. The largest volumetrically is the central uplift in complex impact craters (Fig. 5), where lower pressure (sub-solidus) shock effects are recorded (e.g., shatter cones, feather features, PFs, PDFs, diaplectic glasses, etc.). The second type of impactite are dykes of breccia and\/or impact melt rock that intruded downwards from the overlying (and now removed by erosion) crater-fill deposits (Fig. 5). Such dykes are common in the eroded central uplifts and crater floors of complex craters of all sizes (Dressler and Reimold, 2004) and they preserve a wider range of shock effects than their host target rocks. A recent example of this is the Tunnunik impact structure, Canada. This structure was confirmed based on the presence of spectacular shatter cones but is heavily eroded (Dewing et al., 2013). Follow up fieldwork, led to the discovery of over two dozen breccia dykes where PDFs in quartz and whole rock glass were discovered (Newman and Osinski, 2017).\nCrater size is also a factor. As discussed above in Section 4.3., the smaller the crater, the smaller the volume of material shocked to a given shock pressure. Furthermore, unlike in complex craters, where exposed target rocks in the central uplift are shocked, the exposed target rocks in the rim of simple craters are not shocked to sufficient to pressures to record shock metamorphic effects (Fig. 5). In simple craters, the dominant source of shocked material is in the crater-fill and ejecta deposits. In rare instances and if recovered by drilling or exposed by erosion, the parautochthonous rocks of the crater floor in simple craters, however, do record shock (e.g., at Brent; Robertson and Greive, 1977). The smallest of craters present another challenge. They are most commonly formed in unconsolidated overburden materials, which behave differently to coherent rock and generally result in smaller volumes of shocked material and\/or more ambiguous shock products (see Section 4.3).\nThe identification of impact craters formed in rocks for which known shock effects are lacking or rare (e.g., carbonates and evaporates) presents a distinct problem. For example, apart from shatter cones, there are no currently accepted diagnostic shock metamorphic effects in carbonates (Osinski et al., 2008b). At high shock pressures, impacts into carbonates do result in impact melts, with very unusual compositions and textures, which when combined with other evidence, can provide strong evidence for an impact event. For example, at the Haughton impact structure, Canada, silicate impact glasses with CaO and MgO contents up to ~20 and\u00a0~\u00a030\u00a0wt%, respectively, occur. They are unlike any glass formed via endogenic igneous processes but are consistent with the melting of the limestone and dolomite-dominated target rocks (Osinski et al., 2005b; Osinski and Spray, 2001). At Haughton and other structures, the unusual composition of calcite and associated silicate phases (e.g., clinopyroxene and olivine), and the presence of vesicles and immiscibility textures can also only be explained by melting (see Osinski et al., 2008a, and references therein). As noted above, however, these melt products are concentrated in the crater-fill and ejecta deposits and many of the aforementioned textures also require some proportion of silicate-rich sedimentary rocks in the target rocks. Thus, confirming the origin of deeply eroded and\/or pure carbonate targets, remains an ongoing problem in cratering studies. There is promise in using XRD and Raman spectroscopy to determine shock levels in carbonates via peak broadening (Lindgren et al., 2009; Sk\u00e1la and Jake\u0161, 1999) but at present, this is not yet considered unambiguous evidence for shock. As a result, heavily eroded structures in carbonates such as Jeptha Knob, USA, remain in the list of \u201csuspected\u201d impact structures.\nA final outstanding problem in cratering studies is what to do with buried structures for which no samples are available, but for which detailed geophysical information consistent with an impact origin is available. Such structures are currently not listed in the Impact Earth database. Stewart (2003) presents an interesting discussion of this topic, highlighting the fact that the proliferation of three-dimensional seismic data due to hydrocarbon exploration has produced unprecedented high-resolution subsurface information in many sedimentary basins and outlining a set of geometrical criteria that \u201cappear to be sufficient to uniquely identify an astrobleme imaged via three-dimensional seismic data\u201d. Further investigation of this topic is suggested, as there are undoubtedly many buried impact structures that may be well-preserved, thus offering better opportunities to study, for example, crater morphology and morphometry.\n\n\n\n5\nConfirmed impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters and impact deposits\n\nTables 3, 4 and 5\n\n\n provide up-to-date lists of all confirmed impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters and impact deposits, respectively. Given, however, the lack of any international standards or committee, such as exists for meteorites, we invite input from the community about the accuracy of the current Impact Earth database and as it continues to evolve in the future. (For meteorites, the Meteorite Nomenclature Committee of the Meteoritical Society is \u201cresponsible for establishing guidelines for the naming of meteorites, for the approval of new names, for decisions regarding pairing or separation of meteorites previously named, and for dissemination of this information in the Meteoritical Bulletin and the Meteoritical Bulletin Database\u201d). There are some notable exceptions to our list compared to previous compendia, which are discussed below in Section 5.3.\nThe locations of all confirmed impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters and impact deposits is provided in Fig. 7. It is notable that relatively little has changed in terms of the spatial distribution of impact structures on Earth over the past 30\u00a0years, since reviews by Grieve et al. (1987) and Grieve (1991). Then and now, approximately two-thirds of impact craters and hypervelocity impact craters are located in the ancient cratonic areas of Australia, Europe, and North America, where (relative) tectonic stability and low rates of erosion favour preservation. These are also areas with more active research programs and that are generally more easily accessible.\nIt is noteworthy that the total number of impact craters and hypervelocity impact craters on Earth is unknown and there are reasons to suspect that the terrestrial small crater record is incomplete (cf., Kenkmann, 2021). It is likely that there are several dozen structures with diameters ~100\u2013150\u00a0m in diameter waiting to be discovered (Bland and Artemieva, 2006), largely because of a lack of clear recognition criteria that can be applied to small impact structures (see Sections 4.3. and 4.5.). It is also notable that the past decade has seen an upswing in the number of confirmed impact structures (Fig. 8). Notably, several hypervelocity impact structures discovered in the past decade are over 10\u00a0km in diameter (Hiawatha, Lake Raeside, Luizi, Pantasma, Saqqar, Tunnunik). The reason for this upswing is unclear but this suggests that the conclusion that all craters >6\u00a0km in diameter exposed at the surface have been discovered (Hergarten and Kenkmann, 2015) may be incorrect.\n\n5.1\nImpact craters\n\nTable 3 lists 12 impact craters all >10\u00a0m diameter. Many were discovered in the 1920s and 1930s (Fig. 8) and all were identified based on the presence of meteorite fragments and\/or unusual glasses. At present, unambiguous evidence for shock metamorphism (see Table 2) has not been documented at these sites, despite significant efforts (e.g., as discussed in Section 4.3. for Morasko). (Recall from Section 4.2. that high-temperature glasses and melts are not produced via shock metamorphism and, thus, cannot be used to confirm unequivocally a hypervelocity impact crater.) As such, while some or all of these may be hypervelocity impact craters, until such a time when evidence for shock metamorphism is documented, these sites should all be referred to as impact craters.\nApproximately half of these sites are individual craters: the ~13.5\u00a0m diameter Carancas crater in Peru, the ~24\u00a0m diameter Dalgaranga crater in Australia, the ~15\u00a0m diameter Haviland cater in the USA, the ~36\u00a0m diameter Whitecourt crater in Canada, the ~80\u00a0m diameter Veevers crater in Australia, and the ~170\u00a0m diameter Boxhole crater in Australia. Six of these sites comprise crater strewn fields: Campo del Cielo in Argentina, Henbury in Australia, Kaalijarv in Estonia, Odessa in the USA, Sikhote Alin in Russia, and Morasko in Poland. All of these impact craters were formed either entirely, or in part, in unconsolidated sediments or soils.\n\n\n5.2\nHypervelocity impact craters\n\nTable 4 lists the 188 sites for which there is sufficient published evidence of shock metamorphism to warrant being included in a list of confirmed hypervelocity impact craters (see also Appendix A). Of the 188 confirmed hypervelocity impact craters, all but two are individual craters. The exceptions are the Douglas and Wabar crater strewn fields. For these structures, only the diameter of the largest individual crater is reported in the Impact Earth database, with details on all the individual craters and pits provided in Appendix A. Unlike the impact craters discussed in the previous section, both of these hypervelocity impact crater strewn fields have both meteoritic fragments and confirmed shock metamorphic evidence (Appendix A). These are: PDFs in quartz at Douglas (Kenkmann et al., 2018) and coesite and PDFs in quartz at Wabar (Gnos et al., 2013). In addition to these two impact crater strewn fields, a handful of other hypervelocity impact craters have meteoritic fragments. With only one exception (Morokweng), meteorite fragments have only been documented in simple impact craters, such as the 1.2\u00a0km diameter Meteor or Barringer Crater, USA, where fragments of iron meteorite were recognized over a century ago (Barringer, 1905). The discovery of coesite (Chao et al., 1960) and stishovite (Chao et al., 1962) provided subsequent confirmation of the hypervelocity impact origin of this structure. An intriguing exception for complex craters is contained in the work of Hart et al. (2002), who concluded that siderophile-rich inclusions in impact melt rocks at the ~70\u00a0km diameter Morokweng impact structure, South Africa, represent fragments of a chondritic meteorite. Alwmark and Schmitz (2007) also discovered extraterrestrial chromite grains in the resurge deposit of the 13.5\u00a0km diameter Lockne impact structure, Sweden. In addition to physical fragments, approximately a fifth of the confirmed hypervelocity impact craters have known geochemical and\/or isotopic signatures of the impactor preserved in impact melt-bearing rocks and glasses (Appendix A).\nOf the remaining 186 craters, all but one were confirmed based on the presence of shatter cones and\/or PDFs in quartz (Appendix A), which are considered the two most robust evidences for impact (see section 4.2). The ~14\u00a0km diameter Pantasma impact structure, Nicaragua, is a notable exception in the database, where confirmation of impact is not based on the presence of PDFs in quartz or shatter cones in various lithologies (Appendix A). The lack of PDFs can be ascribed to its quartz-poor (basaltic) target rocks and the tropical rainforest setting means that outcrops are sparse and heavily weathered, making the identification of shatter cones extremely challenging. Instead, diagnostic evidence for impact comes is from the documentation of FRIGN zircon and an extraterrestrial Cr isotopic signal in impact breccias, with supporting evidence in the form of high-temperature glasses and coesite (Rochette et al., 2019).\nAs is evident from Appendix A, PDFs in quartz occur in craters of all sizes, down to the Kamil (45\u00a0m) crater and the Douglas (66\u00a0m largest crater) and the Wabar (116\u00a0m largest crater) impact crater strewn fields. In contrast, shatter cones appear to be absent in craters smaller than ~1\u00a0km and are less common in buried craters. For the latter, this is likely due to the fact that the probability of finding shatter cones, which requires cm to dm-size pieces of rock, is very low, when the only material available is from drill core. Indeed, shatter cones were only recently reported for the first time at the famous Chicxulub impact structure, Mexico, in rocks drilled from the peak ring (Morgan et al., 2016). In theory, there is no reason why shatter cones should not form in small craters, as the pressures required for their formation would have been generated. Indeed, shatter cones have been formed in nuclear explosion tests (Bunch and Quaide, 1968) and even in experimental craters (Shoemaker et al., 1961). Baratoux and Reimold (2016) suggest that the scarcity of shatter cones in small craters is a result of the lower impact velocity of small objects due to deceleration induced by the atmospheric drag. However, given that impact glass \u2013 which requires shock pressures >50\u201360\u00a0GPa, i.e., well above the pressures required for shatter cone formation \u2013 is found in craters down to ~45\u00a0m diameter (e.g., the Kamil crater in Egypt), we therefore suggest that impact velocity is not a major factor. Instead, we suggest that the scarcity of shatter cones in small simple craters is largely due to the fact that apart from a very small region underneath the point of impact in the crater floor, the majority of the in situ target rocks in simple craters available for sampling (i.e., the crater wall and rim) were not subjected to shock pressures capable of forming shatter cones (Fig. 4). Instead, shatter cones in simple craters typically occur only as clasts in breccias in the crater-fill and ejecta. Such deposits are rapidly eroded and\/or overlain by sediment, which significantly reduces the chance of finding shatter cones in simple craters. For example, despite a century of study, no shatter cones have been identified at Meteor or Barringer Crater. In contrast, at complex craters, the most common discovery location for shatter cones is in central uplifts, where they occur in situ and exposed at the surface (Fig. 4; Appendix A) (cf., Osinski and Ferri\u00e8re, 2016). Furthermore, with erosion, the exposed area of a central uplift actually increases, such that the possibility of identifying shatter cones also increases.\nWith respect to target rocks, as noted above, approximately two-thirds of the confirmed terrestrial hypervelocity impact structures occur in the ancient cratonic areas of Australia, Europe, and North America, which comprise metamorphic and plutonic igneous rocks at their cores. However, in a review of the target rock types for both impact craters and hypervelocity impact craters, Osinski et al. (2008b) noted that ~70% of the world's known impact structures occur, in part, in sedimentary target rocks. Despite the number of new hypervelocity impact structures confirmed since this time, an assessment of the Impact Earth database shows that exactly 70% of such sites had some amount of sedimentary rock present at the time of impact. In detail, 76 hypervelocity impact craters formed in entirely sedimentary target rocks, 55 in purely crystalline targets (which includes metamorphic and igneous rocks), and with the remainder (57) forming in mixed targets, with some thickness of sedimentary rock overlying crystalline basement rocks. As discussed in Section 7, the abundance of hypervelocity impact structures formed in sedimentary target rocks causes great difficulty when attempting to determine accurate and precise ages for these structures. Target lithology also affects the morphology and morphometry of impact structures (see Section 9) and the impactites produced (see Section 10).\nGiven the fact that two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered by water, it would be expected that a large number of impact features on Earth formed in such an environment. However, the record is notably sparse. Dypvik and Jansa (2003) in their review of such impacts listed five submarine hypervelocity impact craters (i.e., craters that formed and remain located in the sea\/ocean floor) and 11 marine impacts (i.e., craters that formed in the sea\/ocean but that are presently exposed on land), with a few other \u201cpossible\u201d candidates and impact deposits. Included in the Impact Earth database are the more recently discovered Decorah (French et al., 2018), Glasford (Monson et al., 2019), M\u00e5lingen (Orm\u00f6 et al., 2014), and Talundilly (Gorter and Glikson, 2012) marine hypervelocity impact structures. In addition, it is also clear that the Sudbury impact structure occurred in a marine setting (Grieve et al., 2010). It is outside the scope of the current contribution to review details of marine impacts, but there is considerable variation in the morphology, morphometry, and products from such events, as recently discussed by Orm\u00f6 et al. (2021). These differences compared to impacts on land appear to be largely dependent on the size of the impact event with respect to the water depth (Gault and Sonett, 1982; W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2007) and complicates estimates of crater diameter (section 8), and greatly affects the morphology and morphometry (Section 9), and types of impactites (Section 10) produced during such impacts.\nA final point is that the literature of a considerable number of craters consists only of the original confirmation publication, which, from the point of view of reproducibility, is not ideal. While this includes craters that have been discovered very recently, there are also a number of craters where the impact origin was confirmed decades ago but with no subsequent follow-up studies. There are also examples of structures, which have been proposed as impact craters for some time but for which unequivocal evidence of impact has only more recently been presented. An example is Upheaval Dome, Utah (Shoemaker and Herkenhoff, 1983), which is very accessible in Canyonlands National Park, but for which a small number of PDFs were only identified in 2008 (Buchner and Kenkmann, 2008). This is ascribed to its highly eroded nature, such that virtually all shock diagnostic evidence has been removed.\n\n\n5.3\nSome notable \u201cimpact craters\u201d and \u201chypervelocity impact craters\u201d not listed here\nWhile there are undoubtedly many more impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters, and impact deposits lying awaiting discovery or confirmation, the rigorous application of criteria outlined in Section 4 is paramount. With this in mind, there are a small number of structures for which an impact origin has been previously suggested \u2013 and which have appeared in many previous lists of \u201cconfirmed\u201d impact structures \u2013 that we do not list in the Impact Earth database. We briefly outline the reasoning for these decisions below.\n\nCrawford, Australia: The Crawford structure is excluded for two reasons. First, as noted by Haines et al. (1999) \u201cdefinitive evidence of shock metamorphism is lacking\u201d for this structure. Second, as discussed by Haines et al. (1999) and Haines (2005), the Crawford structure lies within a few 10s km of the Flaxman impact structure and it is unclear at present as to whether this is a separate impact crater or if these structures represent one single structure.\n\nGusev, Russia: This structure lies close to the confirmed Kamensk impact structure in a similar geological setting (Movshovich and Milyavskiy, 1988). The literature is scarce on this structure, but based on what is presented, there is no evidence showing shock metamorphism nor of an impactor or meteoritic component. Until a time when such evidence is provided, we suggest that the Gusev structure should not be considered a hypervelocity impact structure.\n\nMacha, Russia: The impact origin of Macha is suggested by a single study (Gurov and Gurova, 1998) that seems to be an English-language version of a Russian paper (Gurov et al., 1987). The impact evidence presented is in the form of PDFs in quartz and the chemical composition of metallic particles. However, the presented images of PDFs are either clearly not showing PDFs because they are not planar nor parallel (their Fig. 6\n), or the quality of images is so low quality that the identification of microstructures is problematic (their Figs. 7 and 8\n\n). Additionally, the full indexing of planar deformation features was not performed; instead only frequency distribution of measured angles between poles of planar structures and optical axis in quartz of Macha craters are presented. The provided chemical analysis of three metallic particles is also inconclusive. For example, they contain some nickel (0.084\u20130.2\u00a0wt%) and cobalt (trace to 0.026\u00a0wt%), but both of those values are much less than expected from iron meteorites (>5\u00a0wt% of Ni and\u00a0>\u00a00.3% of Co; Jarosewich, 1990; Scott, 2020).\n\nIlumetsa, Estonia: This site comprises two circular craters 50\u00a0m and 80\u00a0m in diameter. Based on the presence of two clear circular depressions, ejecta material, charcoal similar to material found in other very small impact craters (e.g., Kaali; Losiak et al., 2016), a post-glacial age that is identical for both structures that are 800\u00a0m apart, its formation due to extraterrestrial collision is at least probable. However, there remains no clear signs of extraterrestrial material (except some high-Ni particles of unclear origin, nor signs of shock metamorphism (Losiak et al., 2020)). This exemplifies the challenge of confirming the impact origin of small craters as discussed in Section 4.3.\n\nPiccaninny, Australia: The Piccaninny structure in Australia was noted by Beere (1983) in an aerial survey and considered the possibility of both an impact and cryptovolcanic origin. Shoemaker and Shoemaker (1985) list Piccaninny as a \u201cdeeply eroded probable impact structure\u201d but these authors also note that no shock metamorphic evidence has been documented to-date.\n\nSobolev, Russia: The Sobolev structure was described by a single study (Khryanina, 1981). It is a 53\u00a0m single crater-like feature with an overturned sequence at the rim with a paleosoil and a charcoal at the similar geomorphic location as in Kaali (Losiak et al., 2016) or Morasko (Szokaluk et al., 2019) as well as magnetic \u201cmelt\u201d spherules with a single reported value of Ni contents up to 2.1%. Shatter cones were also reported from this site, but presented images are not sufficient to confirm their formation in a hypervelocity impact crater.\n\nSuavj\u00e4rvi, Russia: The Suavj\u00e4rvi structure has been proposed to be a deeply eroded complex impact structure with a diameter of ~16\u00a0km and, potentially, the oldest structure preserved on Earth (Mashchak and Naumov, 2012). However, a recent field expedition found no evidence of previously reported impact breccias and the subsequent analysis of samples also found no evidence of shock metamorphism (Huber et al., 2013).\n\n\n5.4\nImpact deposits\nIn addition to impact crater strewn fields and individual craters, there are a number of examples of impact deposits that contain material with a confirmed impact origin; however, most have no known source crater. We have classified such impact deposits into five main categories: tektites, spherule layers, occurrences of other types of glass, breccias, and detrital shocked minerals. Below, we outline these five main categories of impact deposits.\n\n5.4.1\nTektites\nImpact glass is a common product of meteorite impact events (Osinski et al., 2018; St\u00f6ffler, 1984). One of the most well-known types of impact glass are tektites, defined as \u201can impact glass formed at terrestrial impact craters from melt ejected ballistically and deposited sometimes as aerodynamically shaped bodies in a strewn field outside the continuous ejecta blanket\u201d (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). Tektites differ in several ways from other types of impact glass (i.e., diaplectic glass, mineral glass, interstitial impact glass, and whole rock impact glass) (Osinski et al., 2018), found in impactites within and around impact craters. Most notably, tektites commonly have splash-form (e.g., teardrop, dumbbell, or bar) shapes and\/or aerodynamic shapes with evidence of atmospheric ablation in the form of pits, grooves, or flanged button shapes. The composition of most tektites is also distinctive, with extremely low H2O contents (often ppm levels) (Beran and Koeberl, 1997; Ferri\u00e8re et al., 2021), high Fe2+\/Fe3+ ratios (Heide et al., 2001), and 10Be concentrations that suggest the source region must have been in the upper few hundred meters of the target area (Koeberl, 1994). These properties have led to models of tektite formation that differ from the typical impact glasses emplaced within and around craters. Namely, they are formed in high-velocity (>15\u201320\u00a0km\/s) and oblique (30\u201345o) impacts into silica-rich and possibly unconsolidated targets and originate from the melting of near-surface target materials, which is ejected at high-velocity very early in the crater formation process (Artemieva et al., 2002; St\u00f6ffler et al., 2002).\nThe formation of tektites, however, is not without debate. There are only a few known occurrences. Until very recently, only four large so-called strewn fields of tektites), which have been known since the 1930s (Glass, 1990), have been documented (Table 5): the Australasian, the Ivory Coast or ivoirites, the Central European (Czechoslovakian\/Moldavian), also commonly known as moldavites, and the North American (also called bediasites and georgiaites) strewn fields. Two other possible strewn fields have also recently been proposed. The first is in the form of impact glasses from Belize that have been linked to the Pantasma impact crater located ~530\u00a0km away (Rochette et al., 2021). We say \u201cpossible\u201d as the authors acknowledge that while the Belize impact glasses share many characteristics with known tektites, they also possess \u201cseveral peculiar features\u201d. The second is a new potential tektite strewn field discovered in Uruguay (Ferri\u00e8re et al., 2017).\n\n\n5.4.2\nSpherule layers\nAs is evident from Table 5, millimetre-sized spherules are the most common type of distal impact deposit. When found in continuous beds, they are known as known as \u201cairfall beds\u201d or \u201cimpactoclastic\u201d deposits (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). A few have been linked to specific craters, but the majority have no known source crater (Table 5). This is not surprising given the Precambrian ages of the majority of spherule beds (Table 5). Indeed, given the age of the oldest reliably-dated hypervelocity impact structure on Earth (2229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma for the Yarrabubba impact structure, Australia; Erickson et al., 2020), these spherule beds are the only record of Archean impacts (i.e., >2.5 to <4\u00a0Ga) on Earth and provide a unique glimpse into bombardment rates in the inner Solar System during the first 2 billion years of its history (e.g., Bottke and Norman, 2017; Kirchoff et al., 2021). It remains unclear as to the minimum size of impact required to generate these spherule airfall beds; however, given their concentration in the Precambrian and knowledge of distal deposits from two of the three largest preserved craters (Chicxulub and Sudbury), it is likely that such deposits require >10\u00a0km-size impactors and\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0km-diameter craters.\nNumerical modelling presented by Johnson and Melosh (2012) suggests that glassy spherules present in distal ejecta can form in two fundamentally different ways: via \u201cconventional\u201d impact melting or by condensation from a vapour phase. These authors suggested the terms \u201cmelt droplets\u201d and \u201cvapour condensate spherules\u201d, as the two respective products. Another potential source of confusion that some spherules are sometimes referred to as microtektites (if they consist entirely of glass) or microkrystites (if they contain primary microlites). It remains unclear if tektites (see Section 5.4.1) and microtektites have the same origins and it is outside the scope of this contribution to revisit the origin of the many spherule layers listed in Table 5.\n\n\n5.4.3\nOther glass occurrences\nIn addition to tektites and spherules, there are a number of occurrences of glasses that are widely, although not universally, accepted as being of impact origin but for which no source crater has been recognized. Well known examples include Dakhleh Glass (Osinski et al., 2007), Darwin Glass (Meisel et al., 1990), Edeowie Glass (Haines et al., 2001) Libyan Desert Glass (Weeks et al., 1984), and South Ural Glass or Urengoites (Deutsch et al., 1997). Evidence for the impact origin of these glasses typically comes from their unusual compositions, including nearly pure SiO2, or having CaO and MgO contents >20\u00a0wt%, which distinguishes them from volcanic glasses. The origin of these glasses is enigmatic. It is notable that all occur as individual glass bodies and not as clasts in breccias (see section 5.4.4. below for such examples), so they do not represent eroded remnants of crater-fill or proximal ejecta blankets. The size of individual glass bodies ranges from cm to several dm, they lack aerodynamic shapes and other evidence of quenching during passage through the atmosphere (in contrast to tektites), and there is evidence for ponding in a liquid state.\nThe most plausible formation mechanism for, at least some of, these glasses is through large airbursts. As noted in Section 3, numerical modelling suggests that during large low-altitude airbursts, a high-temperature jet is formed that, if it makes contact with the Earth's surface, will result in the melting of surficial sediments, producing large amounts of impact glass (Boslough and Crawford, 2008). Numerical modelling adds credence to earlier suggestions that airbursts may be responsible for the formation of the ~780\u00a0ka Australian tektites (Wasson et al., 1995), the Libyan Desert Glass (Wasson and Boslough, 2000), and the Dakhleh Glass, Egypt (Osinski et al., 2007, 2008c). The recent discovery of condensation spherules in Antarctica has also been explained as being due to a large airbirst event at ~430\u00a0ka (Van Ginneken et al., 2021), and widespread glasses in the Atacama Desert, Chile, have also recently been proposed to have formed during nearly simultaneous cometary airbursts near the end of the Pleistocene Period (Schultz et al., 2021). It should be noted, however, that these same Atacama or \u201cPica\u201d glasses have also been interpreted as the product of natural fires in dried out wetlands (Roperch et al., 2017, 2022). In addition, in the case of the Libyan Desert Glass, Koeberl and Ferri\u00e8re (2019) have recently reported on the first occurrence of PFs, PDFs, and FFs in quartz grains from bedrock samples from the area of occurrence of the Libyan Desert Glass, and shocked zircon grains have been reported in Libyan Desert Glass (Cavosie and Koeberl, 2019), suggesting that there was a physical impact event, not just an airburst, and that the crater has been almost completely eroded since its formation. Shocked zircon grains have also been reported in Australasian MN-type tektites from southeast Asia (Cavosie et al., 2018b), which also suggests an impact origin involving crater formation.\n\n\n5.4.4\nBreccia layers\nIn addition to deposits of tektites, spherules, and other glassy bodies described in the previous sections, there are some rare instances in the geological record of lithified rock units that have been proposed to be of impact origin and\/or to contain material derived from a hypervelocity impact event. The most famous and longest known example is the Late Devonian age Alamo Breccia. Originally identified in 1990 by J. E. Warme, it was initially described as a catastrophic marine sedimentary megabreccia that covers ~10,000\u00a0km2 in southern Nevada. The discovery of PDFs in quartz in the Alamo Breccia by Leroux et al. (1995) subsequently led to the conclusion that this widespread unit was formed by a hypervelocity impact event. However, it is important to note that the Alamo Breccia does not conform to the definition of an impactite (see Section 10) as it is not part of an ejecta blanket or crater-fill deposit; rather, it represents a sedimentary deposit whose formation was triggered by the impact event and that contains some shocked material mixed in with local non-impact material (Warme and Kuehner, 1998).\nOther examples include the Vakkejokk Breccia, Sweden, and the Stac Fada Formation, Scotland, both of which were confirmed through the presence of PDFs in quartz. The \u226427\u00a0m thick Vakkejokk Breccia outcrops for ~7\u00a0km on the northern side of Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk in Sweden and is interpreted to be the primary ejecta deposit of a crater formed ~520\u00a0Ma that is now obscured by later Caledonian overthrusts immediately north of the main breccia section (Orm\u00f6 et al., 2017). The Stac Fada Member is an 1177\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0Ma age (Parnell et al., 2011) distinctive glass-bearing breccia that outcrops at several locations over ~50\u00a0km along the coast of northwest Scotland. Originally interpreted to be volcanic in origin (Lawson, 1973; Young, 2002), before being interpreted as the primary ejecta blanket of a now eroded or buried impact structure (Amor et al., 2008), more recent work suggest that this deposit formed via the interaction of hot impact melt with water \u2013 akin to what occurs during phreatomagmatic volcanic eruptions \u2013 and represents material emplaced as high-energy ground-hugging sediment gravity flows beyond the extent of the continuous ejecta blanket (Osinski et al., 2020c) (see also Section 10.3.).\n\n\n5.4.5\nDetrital shocked minerals\nSedimentary deposits containing the erosional remnants derived from primary impactites represent a different type of impact deposit, as they continue to form as a crater erodes over time, and thus preserve long-term archives of terrestrial impact cratering processes. Detrital shocked minerals are those which originated in target rocks (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary), and then were shock-deformed during impact, and subsequently eroded and transported as sand grains. Examples of local (mostly within or proximal to source crater) sedimentary reworking of shocked target rocks, minerals, and impact glass by glacial and fluvial processes were reviewed by Buchner and Schmieder (2009). Distally-transported detrital shocked minerals in modern and ancient sedimentary deposits have since been reported from several confirmed impact structures. Along with shocked quartz, accessory minerals such as zircon, monazite, and xenotime, are known to form shock deformation microstructures, and have proven to be particularly useful in detrital shocked mineral studies given their refractory character and use as U-Pb geochronometers. Detrital shocked quartz, monazite, xenotime, and zircon eroded from the Vredefort Dome have been reported within the structure (Cavosie et al., 2010, 2021), and at distances up to nearly ~2000\u00a0km downstream from the impact structure in modern alluvium from the Vaal and Orange rivers (Erickson et al., 2013; Montalvo et al., 2017). Detrital shocked minerals have also been reported in mid-Pleistocene (~1.7\u20131.3\u00a0Ma) fluvial terraces of the Vaal River up to ~750\u00a0km downstream from the Vredefort Dome (Cavosie et al., 2018a), and in Permian glacial deposits (diamictite and tillite) of the ca. 300\u00a0Ma Dwyka Group in a southwest (down-ice) direction from the Vredefort structure (Pincus et al., 2015). Detrital shocked quartz and zircon were also been reported from the Sudbury impact structure, in both modern alluvium and Holocene glacio-fluvial outwash delta deposits and eskers (Thomson et al., 2014). Detrital shocked minerals have also been used to better resolve the distribution of shocked bedrock at craters that are poorly preserved or have otherwise been deformed and\/or deeply eroded (e.g., Montalvo et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n\n6\nPreservation state of the terrestrial record\nAs noted at the outset, the power and utility of the impact cratering record on Earth is the ability to conduct fieldwork, drilling, geophysical surveys, and to collect samples from known locations, which are all lacking in the remote observations of craters on other planetary bodies. An obvious drawback, which is also true for some other planetary bodies with active erosion (e.g., Mars, Titan), is that all craters on Earth are eroded to some degree. This makes comparative studies with other terrestrial craters, on other planetary bodies, fraught with uncertainty, and also makes the determination of age (Section 7), size (Section 8), and original morphology (Section 9) difficult or impractical in some cases. However, the erosional state of terrestrial craters is also a positive attribute depending what aspect of the cratering process one is interested in, as it allows for direct observations of their subsurface nature. For example, more deeply eroded craters provide an excellent opportunity to study the structural geology of complex impact craters once the overlying allochthonous ejecta and crater-fill deposits are removed.\nA useful concept introduced by Dence (1972) is the degree of erosion (Table 6\n), which is essentially a measure of the preservation state of a particular crater. In compiling the Impact Earth database, we have determined the degree of erosion for all impact craters and hypervelocity impact craters, which has resulted in some suggested clarifications and minor changes to the original classification (Table 6). It is clear, with certain exceptions (e.g., Pantasma, erosion level 3), that the majority of craters discovered in the past couple of decades are deeply eroded.\nIt is hoped that providing the degree of erosion will enable future studies of the terrestrial impact record by making it easier to \u201cselect\u201d craters for study. For example, if the goal is to study impact ejecta emplacement, then only craters with degree of erosion 1 or 2 should be considered. The degree of erosion also provides a certain first-order qualitative measure of reliability of certain other attributes, particularly for attributes such as crater size (see Section 8), which generally speaking becomes harder to determine the more eroded a crater becomes.\n\n\n7\nCrater ages\n\n7.1\nApproaches and challenges in dating terrestrial impact structures\nEstablishing accurate and precise ages for impact craters can: link impacts to mass extinctions and other effects on the geo- and biosphere (Schulte et al., 2010; Swisher et al., 1992) and the other way around (Holm-Alwmark et al., 2021); reveal trends in impact flux through time and allow evaluation of periodicity (e.g., Bland, 2005; Deutsch and Sch\u00e4rer, 1994); help to calibrate the geological time scale via ejecta in sedimentary records and sedimentary deposits within the crater for palaeoclimate studies (e.g., Jolley et al., 2013; Parnell et al., 2010); link distal ejecta deposits with source craters (e.g., Deutsch and Koeberl, 2006; Renne et al., 2018); constrain duration of crater cooling and hydrothermal activity (e.g., Kenny et al., 2019; Schmieder and Jourdan, 2013); and constrain the overall continental cratering rate which helps to inform the present day likelihood of impact on Earth (Kelley and Sherlock, 2013).\nThe two main ways of establishing impact structure chronology are stratigraphic and isotopic dating techniques (e.g., Kelley and Sherlock, 2013; Schmieder and Kring, 2020). A summary of the main techniques used for impact geochronology and referred to in the Impact Earth Database can be found in Table 7\n. Stratigraphy can be used to establish an age bracket for an impact event, but with a very small number of exceptions (e.g., Mjolnir; Smelror et al., 2001) this does not produce precise ages. A higher degree of precision is often required in order to establish exact timing of an impact event, for which we turn to isotopic dating (Table 7) (Deutsch and Sch\u00e4rer, 1994; Jourdan et al., 2009; Schmieder and Kring, 2020).\nIt is notable that many impact structures have only poor to non-existent age constraints. Indeed, only 37 (out of 188) hypervelocity impact structures in the Impact Earth Database have ages that are precise (\u00b1 2% at 2\u03c3) (Table 4) (Fig. 9\n) (cf., Jourdan et al., 2009; Schmieder and Kring, 2020). To provide context, \u00b1 2% precision is still poor relative to the objectives of the international EarthTime initiative (http:\/\/www.earth-time.org), established to sequence Earth history at a resolution of \u00b10.1% at 2\u03c3. The most precise impact crater ages are Carancas and Sikhote Alin, as they were observed events on 15 September 2007 (Brown et al., 2008) and 12 February 1947 (Krinov, 1971), respectively. The most precise age determined for a hypervelocity impact crater is Sudbury at 1849.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21 (2\u03c3, 0.011%, 207Pb\/206Pb melt-grown zircon; Davis, 2008). Because impact craters are smaller than hypervelocity impact craters, they are harder to prove as unambiguously impact-generated, tend to be younger when found (older ones are more easily erased), and produce fewer datable phases, making them a significant challenge to determine precise and accurate ages. As a result, only 3 out of 13 impact craters in the Impact Earth Database have age precisions <2%, and two of those were observed events. Despite the challenges, there is hope for the dating of the terrestrial impact cratering record, due to recent improvements in geochronology, particularly in the accuracy and precision of the 40Ar\/39Ar and U-Pb systems (e.g., Kenny et al., 2019; Renne et al., 2013; Renne et al., 2010; Schoene, 2014; Sprain et al., 2018). Indeed, age constraints on impact structures can achieve precision on the scale of thousands of years, but only if suitable phases exist that can be clearly associated with the impact event.\nThe Impact Earth Database allows a re-evaluation of the precision of impact structures with ages updated according to the recommendations of Jourdan et al. (2009), Schmieder and Kring (2020) and publications released since, and shows the following: total number of hypervelocity impact structures\u00a0=\u00a0188; total not successfully dated (those reported with ~, <, or >, or age ranges rather than uncertainties)\u00a0=\u00a0123 (65%), with only 37 (19%) dated at \u201chigh-precision\u201d better than \u00b12% (Figs. 9, 10\n). The number of \u201chigh-precision\u201d ages in this re-evaluation is substantially higher than the 15 reported by Jourdan et al. (2009), due to recent improvements to the ages of several (28) new\/revised ages since 2009. Jourdan et al. (2009) also point out that in the case of many impact structures, little can be done to improve the chronology using current technology, dating schemes, and approaches, as many impact structures lack datable lithologies (i.e., lithologies, such as impact melt rocks, in which the isotope systematics were demonstrably reset by the impact).\nDifficulties with dating impact structures arise from the availability of samples appropriate for geochronology (e.g., sedimentary targets often lack minerals suitable for radiosotopic age determination) and the textural and chemical complexity of impactites. Such complexities include variable degrees of melting and isotopic resetting (90% of target rocks are not completely reset by impact events (Deutsch and Sch\u00e4rer, 1994)), inclusion of unmelted clasts in impact melt rocks and glasses (Deutsch and Sch\u00e4rer, 1994; Jourdan et al., 2009), the complex effects of shock metamorphism (Winslow III et al., 2004), and post-impact hydrothermal alteration of materials.\n\n\n7.2\nCase studies\nDue to improvements in the isotopic techniques, as well as refinements in the ages of stratigraphic boundaries, the accepted ages of impact structures have been known to change, sometimes substantially, over time. For example, the Haughton impact structure has had its age determined at least seven times between 1987 (Omar et al., 1987) and 2021 (Erickson et al., 2021) by numerous techniques including apatite fission track (Omar et al., 1987), 40Ar\/39Ar (Erickson et al., 2021; Jessberger, 1988; Sherlock et al., 2005; Stephan and Jessberger, 1992), zircon and monazite U-Pb (Erickson et al., 2021; Sch\u00e4rer and Deutsch, 1990) and zircon (U-Th)\/He (Young et al., 2013). With ages ranging from 22.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Ma (Omar et al., 1987) to ~39\u00a0Ma (Sherlock et al., 2005), Haughton embodies many of the difficulties with achieving precise and accurate ages for impact structures because it formed in ~1880\u00a0m of sedimentary rocks overlying a high-grade metamorphic basement, and has impact melt rocks originating from carbonates and not silicate lithologies; this limits the amount of phases available for radioisotopic studies. However, Erickson et al. (2021) conducted a combined study of the age of Haughton using U-Pb of zircon and monazite with 40Ar\/39Ar of impact-melted K-rich feldspar derived from clasts of impact breccia (interestingly, from the same samples used by Sch\u00e4rer and Deutsch (1990) and Stephan and Jessberger (1992)). Critically Erickson et al. (2021) coupled their isotopic measurements with detailed microanalysis to inform interpretation of age data. They found that the U-Pb and 40Ar\/39Ar ages agreed within uncertainty but recommend use of the 40Ar\/39Ar age because it is more precise at 31.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0Ma. Like many recent studies that have ended up \u201cunchaining\u201d apparent crater clusters, this work also moves Haughton out of age uncertainty with Wanapitei and Mistastin Lake (as was suggested by (Sherlock et al., 2005)), and makes it clear that Haughton was not part of the Oligocene impact spike or the possible Eocene \u201cspike\u201d of Popigai and Chesapeake Bay.\nAnother major debate of impact synchronicity has involved the apparent crater doublet of East and West Clearwater Lakes. Since 1963 at least 9 attempts have been made to determine precise and accurate ages for these structures using fission track, Rb-Sr, K-Ar, 40Ar\/39Ar, and (U-Th)\/He. East Clearwater has proven notoriously difficult to date due to the presence of extraneous 40Ar in impact melt rocks (for detailed discussion of the effects of extraneous argon see e.g., Jourdan et al. (2007), Kelley (2002), and Pickersgill et al. (2020). The possibility that Clearwater East and West formed by impact of a binary asteroid rested largely on a Rb-Sr mineral isochron age of 287\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026\u00a0Ma for East Clearwater (Reimold et al., 1981, recalculated and reanalysed by Schmieder et al. (2015) to 293\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0110\u00a0Ma). This age agreed with previous ages for Clearwater West of ~300\u00a0Ma (using K-Ar, Rb-Sr, and fission track). However, statistical analysis of the Clearwater East age by Schmieder et al. (2015) demonstrated that the Rb-Sr age was disturbed, and likely not representative of the true age of the crater. Schmieder et al. (2015) then conducted 40Ar\/39Ar analysis on samples of melt rock from both Clearwater East and West and determined an age for West of 286.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0Ma, in agreement with previous age estimates; and a best estimate age for East of ~460\u2013470\u00a0Ma, in agreement with the maximum age estimate of Bottomley et al. (1990). Both Bottomley et al. (1990) and Schmieder et al. (2015) encountered characteristic signs of extraneous 40Ar in the age spectra plots from Clearwater East, which is why despite having used a robust isotopic system the age is still is still regarded as a \u201cbest estimate\u201d at ~460\u2013470\u00a0Ma. A subsequent (U-Th)\/He study (Biren et al., 2016) on both East and West yielded results in agreement with Schmieder et al. (2015) of an age for Clearwater West of 280\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027\u00a0Ma (compare to 286.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0Ma from Schmieder et al., 2015) and 450\u00a0\u00b1\u00a056\u00a0Ma for East Clearwater (compare to 460\u2013470\u00a0Ma from Schmieder et al., 2015). These combined results confirm that East and West Clearwater did not form at the same time, as further supported by palaeomagnetic studies (the two craters have different remanent magnetisation as measured by Scott et al. (1997) and discussed in Schmieder et al., 2015), stratigraphic considerations (Ordovician clasts have been found in West, but not in East (Schmieder et al., 2015, and references therein), and no meteoritic signature has been detected in Clearwater West, while Clearwater East shows a clear chondritic signature (Palme et al., 1978).\n\n\n7.3\nAges of terrestrial impact structures through time\nThe Impact Earth database (Appendix A) reveals that the oldest preserved hypervelocity impact structure on Earth is the Yarrabubba impact structure in Australia, which is dated at 2229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 (Ma (2\u03c3, 0.2%) as determined by U-Pb of monazite and zircon in impact melt rocks (Erickson et al., 2020). Thus, there are no impact structures from the first two-and-a-half billion years of Earth's existence (Fig. 10). The youngest hypervelocity impact structures are the Wabar craters in Saudi Arabia at 290\u00a0\u00b1\u00a038\u00a0years (luminescence), and suggested to be linked to a fireball in 1863 (Prescott et al., 2004). The youngest impact crater is Carancas, Peru, which was observed to form on 15 September 2007 (0.000014\u00a0Ma). The youngest with age determined by isotopic methods is Whitecourt, Canada (<0.0011\u00a0Ma (<1.1\u00a0ka), determined by 14C of charcoal by Herd et al., 2008).\nAs mentioned previously, the main reasons to be interested in impact crater ages is to tie them to events in Earth's (and the Solar System's) history. However, there is clear bias in the record of terrestrial impact structures as evidenced by the rather small number found on Earth compared to other planetary bodies. In addition to the challenge of highly precise and accurate geochronology, we are faced with the challenge of Earth being a less-than-ideal laboratory for impact crater preservation due to plate tectonics, water coverage, and burial. This causes substantial difficulties in recognising periodicity or clusters of craters, as well as in associating craters with past events in Earth's climate, biological, and geological evolution.\nIt is always tempting to think that when craters are spatially related (i.e., formed close together) that they are temporally related as well; however, as discussed above in the case of ~28\u00a0km apart Clearwater East and Clearwater West structures such assumptions are frequently unfounded. Similarly, the Suvasvesi North and South structures, which are located ~7\u00a0km from each other, formed at least 630 Myrs apart (Schmieder et al., 2016). The Lockne and M\u00e5lingen impacts on the other hand (~16\u00a0km apart) appear to have a strong case for being a doublet both having formed in the same biostratigraphic zone and with neither preserving ejecta from the other (Orm\u00f6 et al., 2014). Discussions of the merits of several potential crater doublets (two craters formed by impact of a binary asteroid) is discussed in Miljkovi\u0107 et al. (2013) and Schmieder et al. (2015).\nGoing beyond the possibility of crater doublets (two forming simultaneously), we can look at more spread out clusters, potentially related to multiple impacts over several million years by a family of asteroids. The most prominent such clustering are the 22 impact structures which formed during the Ordovician (~485 to ~443\u00a0Ma) (Fig. 10). Also associated with such a spike are the fossil meteorites found in Sweden (Schmitz et al., 2001), and an impact breccia in Estonia (Alwmark et al., 2010), many of which have yielded an impactor signature associated with an L-chondrite source. This cluster of impacts and meteorites has been explained as being due to the impact disruption of the L chondrite parent body resulting in an enhanced flux of asteroids to Earth during the following 30 Myr (Schmitz et al., 2001). Lagain et al. (2022) recently challenged this idea and instead ascribe this as a preservation bias in the rock record. A late Eocene (~38 to ~35\u00a0Ma) cluster of four impact structures coupled with extraterrestrial geochemical signatures at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary supports a clustered bombardment of Earth at that time also (Schmieder and Kring (2020) and references therein). Conversely, improved geochronology has recently \u201cunchained\u201d several impacts (Lake Saint Martin, Manicouagan, Obolon, Red Wing, and Rochechouart; Appendix A) once suggested to represent an impact spike in the late Triassic (~214\u00a0Ma; Spray et al., 1998).\nAnother significant discussion over the past ~40\u00a0years is the possibility of periodicity in the impact cratering record. Raup and Sepkoski (1984) first suggested the possibility after observing a periodic pattern of mass extinctions in during the Phanerozoic with a mean interval of 26 Myrs. Subsequent research found similar repetitive pattern of large impacts, and hypothesized that the extinctions and the impacts may be linked (e.g., Alvarez and Muller, 1984; Rampino et al., 2002; Rampino and Caldeira, 2015). However those results were based largely on crater ages that have since been refined, and other researchers have questioned the validity of the periodicity hypothesis (e.g., Bailer-Jones, 2011; Baksi, 1990; Grieve et al., 1985, 1988; Heisler and Tremaine, 1989; MacLeod, 1998). Most recently, Meier and Holm-Alwmark (2017) conducted a circular spectral analysis of terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters over the last 260 Myrs, and, in contrast to the findings of Rampino and Caldeira (2015), found no evidence for periodicity in the impact record. The main difference between the two studies is the accuracy and precision of ages used. The former used only those with precision <2%, while the latter used those with precision <10%, further emphasizing the need for improvement in the precision and accuracy of impact-related ages.\nThus far, the only convincing case of hypervelocity impact as a driver of mass extinction remains the Chicxulub impact structure, which has been linked to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction by 40Ar\/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology, stratigraphy, micro-paleaontology, and geochemistry (e.g., Hildebrand et al., 1991; Schulte et al., 2010; Swisher et al., 1992).\nIn summary, there is an urgent need to improve the precision and accuracy of impact crater ages, which has been substantially addressed over the last decade (~80 new\/refined ages for impact structures in the last 10\u00a0years), but most ages still remain poorly refined and too imprecise to confidently correlate with other events in Earth's past. Based on the current record, synchronous multiple impacts on Earth are rare, with no robust evidence for a large multiple impact event; although Miljkovi\u0107 et al. (2013) point out that impacts by doublet asteroids might be disguised as apparent single circular craters or elongate craters, rather than two separate structures. Excitingly, geochronology has now reached a precision level capable of resolving crater cooling history (e.g., Kenny et al., 2019; Timms et al., 2020), opening the door to empirical measurements of duration of hydrothermal activity and crater temperature-time curves.\n\n\n\n8\nCrater diameter\nOne of the most fundamental parameters of a crater is its diameter. Unfortunately, this is one of the more difficult metrics to determine for craters on Earth, due to variations in their preservation state (see Section 6). On other planetary bodies, the question is much simpler, as the result of their better state of preservation. In the planetary case, the diameter of a crater can be defined and determined by measuring of the diameter of the topographic rim that rises above the pre-impact target surface. This metric is referred to as the \u201crim diameter\u201d or \u201cfinal crater diameter\u201d (Turtle et al., 2005) (Figs. 3a,b). As noted earlier, in simple craters, this topographic rim represents a modified version of the original transient cavity rim. In complex craters, however, the inward collapse of the transient cavity walls during the modification stage of crater formation results in a crater structure significantly larger than the original transient cavity (Kenkmann et al., 2012; Melosh and Ivanov, 1999). In this case, the topographic rim typically corresponds to one of the largest fault scarps in the terraced crater rim region (Fig. 4b). For non-elliptical craters, the fastest and preferred method is to use a software package that allows the user to draw a best-fit circle aligned with the crater rim. Studies have shown that this provides estimates with less than ~10% variation from person-to-person (Robbins and Hynek, 2013; Tornabene et al., 2018). It is this diameter that is typically quoted in numerical modeling studies.\nOn Earth, such pristine craters are rare (see Section 6). In their detailed study of the eroded Brent crater, Canada, Grieve and Cintala (1981), referred to the rim or final crater diameter as the \u201cpre-erosional rim crest diameter\u201d. These authors, together with Grieve et al. (1981) also introduced the term \u201capparent diameter\u201d, where this is \u201cthe final crater is that produced after all impact-related modification has ceased\u201d and is \u201cmeasured at or from the original ground surface\u201d. The Brent crater is the most intensively drilled simple terrestrial impact crater and, thus, represents an excellent case study for determining diameter. Grieve and Cintala (1981) record the present diameter as 3.0\u00a0km, the pre-erosional rim crest diameter as 3.8\u00a0km, and the pre-erosional diameter at the original ground surface as 3.4\u00a0km. It is the latter that the authors originally defined as the apparent crater diameter. Turtle et al. (2005) defined \u201capparent crater diameter\u201d of complex craters as \u201cthe diameter of the outermost ring of (semi-) continuous concentric normal faults, measured with respect to the pre-impact surface (i.e., accounting for the amount of erosion that has occurred).\u201d In practice, it is very difficult, and likely close to impossible, to accurately estimate the amount of erosion due to local variations in climatical and geological properties at a crater. Even if regional estimates are well known, a precise and accurate age for the impact is required \u2013 which is often not the case (see Section 6) \u2013 and differential erosion of topographically high crater rims may be significantly different that regional estimates. Indeed, in practice, the apparent crater diameter for complex craters has morphed into the diameter measured at the present day surface.\nIn this study, we, thus, define apparent crater diameter as the diameter of the outermost ring of (semi-) continuous concentric normal faults at the present-day erosional surface. For most complex impact structures in the Impact Earth Database, this is the only value known. This requires detailed field mapping and\/or reflection seismic surveys to delineate faults. For an example of a well-constrained apparent crater diameter and a robust estimate for the rim diameter, the Haughton impact structure, Canada, provides an excellent case study. Due to its relatively young age, it is well-preserved, and, additionally, it is well exposed due to the prevailing polar desert environment. This made it possible to conduct a detailed field mapping campaign that resulted in the production of a detailed 1:25,000 scale geological map that represents the most detailed, complete geological map of a crater of this size (Osinski, 2005); other detailed maps are available but typically only for central uplifts (e.g., Kenkmann et al., 2017; Scherler et al., 2006; Wilshire et al., 1972; Wilson and Stearns, 1968). This mapping documented concentric faults with strike lengths of several kilometers out to a radial distance of 12\u00a0km in the north, west, and south, and 11\u00a0km in the east of the structure, resulting in the value of 23\u00a0km for the apparent crater diameter for Haughton (Osinski and Spray, 2005). The presence of concentric faults out to 12\u00a0km is also confirmed in the single seismic reflection profile through the northwest of the structure (Scott and Hajnal, 1988). This agreement between field mapping and seismic investigations provides a reasonable level of certainty for determining apparent crater diameter for craters, where only the latter is available.\nWhat about the rim diameter for Haughton? While the original morphology of the rim region has largely been lost, there is a topographic depression with a diameter of ~16\u00a0km, which represents one of the earliest estimates for the diameter of Haughton (Frisch and Thorsteinsson, 1978). Importantly, detailed mapping revealed that the outer limit of this depression at ~8\u00a0km radius is marked by a semi-continuous line of concentric listric normal faults that record large-scale (up to 400\u00a0m) displacements of slump blocks in towards the crater center (Osinski and Spray, 2005). While normal faults are present further out, as noted above, displacements are rarely >50\u00a0m such that, in the newly formed Haughton crater, the outermost concentric faults would likely have been concealed by ejecta. Thus, drawing comparisons to fresh complex craters on other planetary bodies, this semi-continuous line of large-displacement concentric listric normal faults provides a robust estimate of the rim diameter of Haughton at 16\u00a0km (Osinski et al., 2005a). Thus, the rim diameter is significantly smaller than the apparent crater diameter of 23\u00a0km.\nUnfortunately, for most complex craters on Earth, such detailed field maps and\/or seismic surveys are not available and so it is not possible to determine the location of the outermost ring of (semi-) continuous concentric normal faults. Mapping faults in the field is also inherently much harder in craters formed in crystalline bedrock that lacks stratigraphic markers. In some cases, the mapping of fractures and lineaments from satellite images has proven to be an effective approach for estimating apparent crater diameter, particularly in glaciated terrains (Mader et al., 2013; Smith et al., 1999).\nAn alternative approach to determine the apparent diameter of a crater based on shatter cone distributions was provided by Osinski and Ferri\u00e8re (2016), who defined the relationship Dsc\u00a0=\u00a00.4 Da, where Dsc is the maximum spatial extent of in situ shatter cones and Da is apparent crater diameter. This relationship was derived from the detailed outcrop-scale mapping of the Haughton and Tunnunik impact structures, where both Dsc and Da were determined to within a few hundred metres. As central uplifts, which contain shatter cones in situ, are typically the last structural feature left remaining\/exposed, this relationship is useful for placing a constraint \u2013 typically a minimum value \u2013 on the diameter of deeply eroded craters of similar size (i.e., 10s km diameter). Indeed, using this knowledge, Osinski and Ferri\u00e8re (2016) were able to provide revised estimates for the diameters of several eroded craters, which is reflected in the Impact Earth Database (Appendix A): Charlevoix (70\u00a0km), Gosses Bluff (32\u00a0km), Keurusselk\u00e4 (36\u00a0km), Luizi (15\u00a0km), Presqu'ile (15\u00a0km), Rochechouart (32\u00a0km), Sierra Madera (20\u00a0km), and Siljan (75\u00a0km) impact structures. It should be noted that this approach is only likely appropriate for structures similar in morphology and morphometry to Haughton and Tunnunik.\nFinally, it should be noted that the above discussion about crater diameter is applicable only for impacts on land. As Dypvik and Jansa (2003) note, the lack of a continuous elevated rim \u2013 due to the return or \u201cresurge\u201d of water into the newly formed crater \u2013 is a conspicuous feature of shallow and deeper marine impacts. In addition, many hypervelocity impact craters in the marine environment display a morphology (see Section 9 below) that is commonly referred to as an \u201cinverted sombrero\u201d (Powars and Bruce, 1999). Both of these attributes makes the determination of crater diameter difficult for hypervelocity marine hypervelocity impact craters.\n\n\n9\nCrater morphology and morphometry\nOn the Moon, and since confirmed on other terrestrial planetary bodies, there is a well-known progression in morphology with increasing crater size, from simple bowl-shaped craters, modified so-called transitional craters, to complex craters with central uplifts whose morphology also changes with increasing diameter (Fig. 3) (see Section 3). It is typically assumed that this same progression in morphology and morphometry with increasing diameter should occur on Earth. In this section, we explore the terrestrial impact record to ascertain whether this is the case.\n\n9.1\nRevisiting the simple-to-complex transition on Earth\nIt is widely cited that the transition from simple to complex craters on Earth occurs at a smaller diameter in sedimentary (2\u00a0km) than in crystalline targets (4\u00a0km). This dates back to the work of Dence (1972), who based this observation on a compilation of the 50 known impact structures at that time. The greater number of craters available with the Impact Earth Database, makes it clear that the situation is more complex. Fig. 11\n provides a plot of all craters in our database between 1 and 6\u00a0km in diameter (n\u00a0=\u00a050), grouped into simple craters with rims preserved (i.e., preservation state 1\u20133), eroded simple craters (i.e., preservation state 4\u20137), and complex craters, all of which are eroded to some degree.\nBased on Fig. 11, it is apparent that the simple-to-complex transition for craters developed in crystalline, sedimentary, and mixed sedimentary-crystalline targets is less clear-cut than reported by Dence (1972) and that this transition occurs over a range of diameters. For crystalline targets, complex structures are observed at sizes of 3.2\u00a0km and greater, a smaller transitional diameter than earlier suggested by Dence (1972). However, it should be noted that the two smallest reported complex craters in crystalline targets in Fig. 10 are the Zapadnayav (d\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0km) and Zeleny Gai (d\u00a0=\u00a03.5\u00a0km), both of which are buried and with poorly constrained diameters. The original morphology of these two structures is also difficult to judge from the literature. Furthermore, it is important to note that the present-day morphology of craters can be very deceiving due to erosion. The 5-km diameter Gow Lake impact structure, Canada, is an excellent example (Fig. 12b). This structure is often cited as a prototypical central peak crater; however, the first detailed field mapping of this structure (Osinski et al., 2012b) following its initial description (Thomas and Innes, 1977) reveals that the central island in Gow Lake is capped by, and comprised predominantly of, allochthonous impact melt rocks and breccias such that in its pristine state, no emergent central peak would have been visible. The island, thus, represents inverted topography whereby the coherent impact melt rocks were more resistant to erosion via glacial and fluvial activity than the surrounding fracture target rocks and less coherent impact breccias. The best explanation for Gow Lake is, thus, that it represents a transitional impact structure.\nFor sedimentary targets, complex structures start to appear at diameters greater than 2.8\u00a0km, i.e., larger than reported by Dence (1972). However, the three smallest structures (B.P. Structure, Goyder, and Ouarkziz), are all deeply eroded impact structures (level 5 or 6), such that estimates for their diameters should be treated with caution. If anything, these diameters could be larger than reported. A notable outlier in Fig. 10 for simplex craters in sedimentary targets is the Goat Paddock impact structure, Australia. Early papers suggested that this structure was a simple impact crater (Harms et al., 1980). More recent work by Milton and Macdonald (2005) confirms the lack of a central uplift, but also noted the modification of the crater walls by slumping and the scalloped outline of the crater rim. These authors suggest that Goat Paddock \u201cbridges the two traditional classes of impact crater: simple and complex\u201d. In other words, like Gow Lake, Goat Paddock may be a transitional impact structure. In summary, the transition from simple to complex craters is more complicated than previously recognized, with the transition diameter for craters developed in different target rocks being less pronounced than previously reported.\n\n\n9.2\nNature of complex impact structures on Earth\nAs discussed in Section 3, fresh complex impact craters on the Moon comprise a centrally uplifted topographic high, surrounded by a low-lying annular region infilled with allochthonous impact breccias and melt rocks (i.e., crater-fill impactites) and, finally, a faulted terraced crater rim (Figs. 3b,c, 4b). In the smallest complex craters on the Moon, the central uplift takes the form of a peak, or closely-spaced cluster of peaks (Fig. 3b). With increasing diameter, a ring appears, forming structures referred to as protobasins or central-peak basins; the disappearance of the peak then signifies the transition to a peak-ring basin (Fig. 3c). It is generally assumed that this same progression occurs for craters on Earth (e.g., Grieve and Pesonen, 1992; Pike, 1985). For example, Grieve and Pesonen (1992) cite examples of central peak craters (Steinheim; Flynn Creek), central-peak basins (Red Wing Creek; Mistastin), and peak-ring basins (West Clearwater; Puchezh-Katunki). However, an analysis of the Impact Earth database suggests that the tacit assumption that fresh terrestrial complex craters would have looked like lunar complex craters is complicated at best, and, potentially, incorrect. We outline the rationale for this statement below.\nThe first observation is that all complex craters on Earth are eroded to some degree and so that current topography may differ from the original morphology. The presence of lakes can be particularly misleading (Fig. 12), as there is a natural tendency to equate the flat surface of a lake to the relatively flat crater floors of lunar craters (Fig. 3), which represents the top of the allochthonous crater-fill impactites. As discussed in the previous section, the Gow impact structure appears at first glance to have a central peak morphology (Fig. 12b) but it is more likely an example of a transitional impact crater. Another example is the West Clearwater Lake impact structure (Fig. 12c). This crater has often been referred to as a peak-ring structure but field mapping reveals that the topographic high points on the ring of islands is predominantly allochthonous impact melt rock and breccia. Thus, while there is uplifted bedrock on these islands, it is, or was, typically entirely overlain by allochthonous impact melt rocks and breccias such that a topographic peak-ring emergent through the crater-fill deposits the likes of Schr\u00f6dinger crater on the Moon (Fig. 3c) would likely not have been present at the time of formation.\nThis begs the question as to what do fresh complex craters on Earth look like? With this question in mind, in Table 8\n we provide details on the nature of the central uplift in all well-preserved (erosion level 1\u20133) small- to mid-size <30\u00a0km diameter non-marine craters (as marine impacts have added complications) for which we could glean enough information from the literature. Several things are apparent from Table 8. First, central uplifts that are unequivocally central peaks are rare. The smallest crater with the most well constrained central peak is the 10.7\u00a0km diameter Bosumtwi impact crater in Ghana (Ferri\u00e8re et al., 2008), which is arguably the best-preserved complex impact structure in crystalline rocks known on Earth, which can be ascribed to its young age of 1.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0Ma. In the 13 to 18\u00a0km in diameter size range, neither the Zhamanshin, Ames, nor Logoisk structures appear to possess central peaks. There are conflicting interpretations for El'gygytgyn, with the potential of a small central peak (Table 8).\nIn the mid-20\u00a0km size range, there are some well-known and well-studied craters that provide important constraints. Based on detailed field mapping and\/or geophysical and drill core data it is clear that the 23\u00a0km diameter Haughton, 24\u00a0km diameter Ries, and 25\u00a0km diameter Steen River structures do not possess central peaks. In contrast, the 24\u00a0km diameter Boltysh structure and, potentially, the Mistastin Lake structure both do. Erosion does not seem to be a factor as all of these structures are relatively young and well-preserved. The most obvious difference between these craters is the nature of the target rocks. The Haughton, Ries and Steen River structures formed in mixed targets, with ~1.9, 0.5\u20130.8, and 1.2\u00a0km of sedimentary rocks, respectively, overlying crystalline basement; whereas the Boltysh and Mistastin Lake structures formed entirely in crystalline rocks. Thus, a simple explanation is that the presence of sedimentary rocks in the target is responsible for the lack of a central peak. Grieve and Therriault (2004) reached a similar conclusion suggesting \u201cit would appear that the lack of central peaks at Haughton, Ries, and Zhamanshin is most likely an effect of target material\u201d but that the ultimate reason \u201cis a more complex (but yet unknown) function of target and impact characteristics\u201d.\nBased on a critical review of the Impact Earth database, we offer the following explanation: central peaks form in all complex craters during the early part of the modification stage. This is consistent with data, albeit with uncertainty due to erosion, that central peaks are present at the Steinheim and Flynn Creek (not included in Table 8 as erosion level 4) impact craters, which formed entirely in sedimentary targets and that are both ~4\u00a0km in diameter (Table 8). In craters formed in sedimentary rocks or mixed targets with thick sedimentary sequences, as diameter increases, these central peaks are inherently unstable and rapidly collapse downwards and outwards during the final phase of the modification stage. Support for this comes from field mapping at the Haughton impact structure, where there is evidence for the outwards collapse of the central uplift following the initial inward and upwards tectonic deformation (Osinski and Spray, 2005), and numerical models (Collins et al., 2008). In craters formed in crystalline rocks, these central peaks are more stable because of the greater strength of the target rocks and, more importantly, the absence of layering, which provides pre-existing planes of weakness that aids outwards collapse.\nAt larger diameters, the cratering record is so incomplete that less can be said about morphology. At some point, however, a transition to the peak-ring morphology should theoretically occur. A recently published synthesis suggests that the 80\u00a0km-diameter Puchezh-Katunki structure possesses neither a central peak or a peak-ring (Masaitis et al., 2020). At the 100\u00a0km-diameter Popigai structure, the exposure is very poor in the crater interior. Based on the compilation map of Whitehead et al. (2002), there are a series of outcrops of uplifted basement rocks in the northeast quadrant that, if they continue around the crater under the Quaternary cover, would suggest that Popigai possesses a peak-ring with a diameter of ~45\u00a0km. However, these outcrops are juxtaposed with impact melt rocks and impact melt-bearing breccias and, in places, overlain by patches of these same impactites, such that this would likely not have been a very prominent topographic peak-ring if it was, in fact, produced.\nIf we consider the three largest hypervelocity impact craters on Earth (Chicxulub, Sudbury, and Vredefort), the Chicxulub structure is the best preserved one and preserves an unambiguous peak-ring (Morgan et al., 2016). It is, however, notable that although the peak-ring in the Schr\u00f6dinger Crater on the Moon (Fig. 2c) rises up to 2.5\u00a0km above the basin floor (Kring et al., 2016), seismic reflection data indicates that Chicxulub's peak ring had as little as ~0.2\u00a0km,and a maximum of ~0.6\u00a0km, of relief before being buried by post-impact sedimentary rocks (Gulick et al., 2008; Morgan et al., 2000). There is substantial evidence that Sudbury also possesses a peak-ring (Grieve and Osinski, 2020), although little can be said about its original morphology and morphometry due to substantial post-impact deformation and erosion. The nature of the central area at the Vredefort impact structure is unknown, because of the substantial (~10\u00a0km) of erosion of the structure.\nIn summary, it appears that the lunar record may be misleading when it comes to reconstructing the morphology of fresh complex craters on Earth. The central uplifts of terrestrial complex impact craters are on the whole, more subdued in their morphology and morphometry. One reason for this difference appears to be the nature of target rocks. As discussed above, mid-sized complex craters in sedimentary or mixed sedimentary\u2013crystalline target rocks (e.g., Haughton, Ries, Steen River) lack central peaks, in contrast to craters in crystalline targets that do (e.g., Boltysh, Mistastin Lake). However, even those craters in crystalline target rocks on Earth that did form central peaks, it is notable that the peaks do not reach the multi-km heights above crater-fill deposits that their lunar counterparts do. In other words, the central peaks, even in the instances where they did form on Earth, were never as high in the first place. The same is true for peak-ring structures as discussed above. We suggest that this is due to two main factors: higher gravity on Earth, which means that less vertical topography is possible, and the fact that topography is more likely to be \u201chidden\u201d by crater-fill allochthonous impactites, due to differential scaling and less cratering efficiency for a given size (Grieve and Cintala, 1992). The added complication is that immediately upon formation, terrestrial craters are subject to endogenic erosion processes that can modify topography, not only reducing relief, but also accenting it, particularly in glaciated terrains, as glaciation does not necessarily strive to form an \u201cequipotential\u201d topographic surface (e.g., observe the Gow Lake, East and West Clearwater, and Manicouagan impact structures in Figs. 12b\u2013d).\n\n\n9.3\nStratigraphic uplift in complex impact structures\nNotwithstanding the discussion in the previous section regarding ambiguities surrounding the original morphology of complex craters on Earth, it is clear that rocks in the centre of such craters are uplifted above their pre-impact stratigraphic level. This was recognized early on in the study of terrestrial craters and led to the definition of stratigraphic uplift (SU) \u201cas the observed amount of uplift undergone by the deepest marker horizon now exposed in the center of a complex structure\u201d (Grieve et al., 1981). A prediction of SU for craters of a certain diameter is an incredibly useful metric as it can potentially provide important information about the subsurface of planetary bodies where the only available information comes from satellite observations; although the effect of differences in gravity has yet to be determined. Based on data from 15 complex impact structures at the time, Grieve et al. (1981) defined the relationship SU\u00a0=\u00a00.06D1.1. This was later updated to SU\u00a0=\u00a00.086D1.03 in Grieve and Pilkington (1996), based on data from 24 structures. Kenkmann (2021) recently provided the relationship SU\u00a0=\u00a00.069D0.96, which is slightly lower than the previous values.\nOur analysis of the Impact Earth Database is presented in Fig. 13\n and yields a SU\u00a0=\u00a00.0945D0.6862 (Fig. 13a) based on 53 complex impact structures. This is lower still than the three previous estimates cited above; however, it is clear that there is considerable scatter (Fig. 13a). We considered several possible explanations for this result. First, it has been discussed elsewhere (e.g., Sections 8, 10.3.) that craters formed in marine environments undergo rapid modification by seawater that can immediately change their morphology. This might be expected to affect SU significantly, but Fig. 13b shows that removing marine craters does not have a pronounced effect.\nA second major aspect that previous equations for SU did not take into account is the level of erosion. As noted above, SU is defined as the amount of uplift undergone by the deepest marker horizon exposed at the present-day (Grieve et al., 1981). Given our understanding of central uplifts \u2013 which is that, overall, the most deep-seated rocks are present in the very centre in a fresh crater (Kenkmann et al., 2014) \u2013 it stands to reason that erosion should have the effect of lowering SU through time. Given this, it would be expected that a plot of SU versus diameter with craters grouped based on degree of erosion (see Section 6, Table 6) would yield the highest value of SU for fresh relatively uneroded craters. However, Fig. 13c and d show that this is not the case. Considering only the best-preserved craters (i.e., degree of erosion 1 and 2), the estimate of SU is even lower, with two well-preserved craters (Mjolnir and Ragozinka) displaying anomalously low values of SU; however, there are only 5 datapoints. Curiously, the equation for SU based on the Impact Earth Database that is most similar to previous estimates comes from plotting the 7 craters with degree of erosion 3 and 4.\nIn summary, if all craters for which a value of SU from the literature is provided are considered \u2013 as was done in previous studies \u2013 then the Impact Earth Database yields a SU\u00a0=\u00a00.0945D0.6862 (Fig. 13a) based on 53 complex impact structures. This is lower than the previous estimates of Grieve et al. (1981), Grieve and Pilkington (1996), and Kenkmann (2021). However, given the dependency of SU on both an accurate estimate of diameter \u2013 which is difficult for most complex impact structures (see Section 8) \u2013 and the determination of which rocks are exposed in the centre of a structure \u2013 which requires a good understanding of the pre-impact target stratigraphy and accurate geological mapping \u2013 we urge caution in the application of the above equation for determining SU. It is also notable that numerical models of terrestrial craters consistently overestimate the amount of SU (e.g., Collins et al., 2008). Clearly, this is a topic that deserves further research.\n\n\n\n10\nImpactites\nOne of the most distinctive features of terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters is the diverse array of rocks, termed impactites, which are produced. The term impactite was first suggested by Dr. H. B. Stenzel, as reported in Barnes (1940), and was originally applied solely to tektites. Nininger (1954) recognized that products other than silica glass are produced during hypervelocity impact and so broadened its use. The current definition of impactite is \u201call rocks affected by one or more hypervelocity impact(s) resulting from collision(s) of planetary bodies\u201d (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). Impactites can be classified based on two main approaches: (1) their textural characteristics, irrespective of setting, as shocked rocks, impact breccias or impact melt rocks (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007) (Table 9\n); and (2) the extent to which they have been moved from their original pre-impact location, as autochthonous, parautochthonous or allochthonous impactites, which can be further subdivided based on the setting in which they occur (Table 9). Unfortunately, there is no consistent terminology for impactites and the report by St\u00f6ffler and Grieve (2007) remains a \u201crecommendation\u201d. Many workers have also pointed out issues with this existing terminology, particularly for melt-bearing impactites (Grieve and Therriault, 2012; Osinski et al., 2016), and further complications arise for impact craters formed in marine environments, where impactites can be rapidly eroded by resurgent waters and redeposited, resulting in mixtures of sedimentary and impact-related material (King et al., 2006; Orm\u00f6 et al., 2006). Below we provide a synthesis of the main characteristics of impactites and their spatial distribution in terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters based on the Impact Earth database. Impactites in marine craters are discussed separately in Section 10.3.\n\n10.1\nImpactites based on textural characteristics\n\n10.1.1\nShocked rocks\nShocked rocks are defined \u201cas non-brecciated rocks, which show unequivocal effects of shock metamorphism, exclusive of whole rock melting\u201d (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). Unequivocal effects of shock metamorphism are discussed in Section 4.2. and presented in Table 2. They are subclassified according to the progressive stages, or Shock Stages, of recorded shock metamorphism depending on their lithology (St\u00f6ffler et al., 2018). However, this definition for shocked rocks is actually at odds with the definition of impactites \u2013 which includes all rocks \u201caffected by one or more hypervelocity impact(s)\u201d \u2013 and the definition for Shock Stage 0 \u2013 which is \u201cunshocked (no unequivocal shock effects)\u201d (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). This becomes important for rocks shocked to low shock levels, such as crater rims, where shock pressures were not sufficient to produce any unequivocal shock effects. Shocked rocks may occur in situ in the crater floor and rims of simple impact structures and as clasts in impact breccias (Fig. 14\n) and impact melt rocks (Fig. 15\n) (Table 9).\n\n\n10.1.2\nImpact breccias\nImpact breccias are typically classified as either lithic (also referred to in the literature as fragmental or clastic) or melt-bearing (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007), with the latter also commonly being referred to as \u201csuevite\u201d. Impact breccias can also be polymict or monomict and have clast sizes ranging from 100\u00a0s\u00a0m to millimetres (Fig. 14). Lithic impact breccias contain lithic and mineral clasts, in a matrix comprised of the same, but finer-grained material (Fig. 14a). These melt-free impact breccias are the most abundant, occurring in 131 of the 188 hypervelocity impact craters on Earth; this includes most marine craters, where the impactites are also sometimes referred to as resurge breccias (Dypvik and Jansa, 2003). Impact melt-bearing breccias contain angular to amoeboid bodies of impact melt \u2013 quenched to glass \u2013 as clasts and in the matrix, in addition to lithic and mineral clasts (Grieve and Therriault, 2012) (Figs. 14b\u2013f). (Because the glass can often be altered to secondary phases, such as clays, the term \u201cmelt-bearing breccia\u201d is preferred, even though the melt is no longer molten.) These impactites occur in 79 hypervelocity impact structures (Appendix A). Impact melt-bearing breccias have been the subject of debate for many years (see Osinski et al., 2016, and references therein). Since their discovery, impact melt-bearing breccias have, in many cases, been referred to as \u201csuevites\u201d \u2013 based on the local name for such a rock at the Ries impact structure, Germany (Engelhardt, 1997) \u2013 and also \u201csuevitic breccias\u201d or \u201csuevitic impact breccias\u201d (e.g., St\u00f6ffler et al., 2018) and this blanket term has been applied to diverse impactites in different settings at a large number of impact structures (Dressler and Reimold, 2001; Masaitis, 1999). As lithological classification usually implies rocks with the same origin, this has hampered the understanding and classification of melt-bearing breccias, in general and specific occurrences, in particular (Grieve et al., 1977; Grieve and Therriault, 2012). It has, therefore, been recommended that the term \u201csuevite\u201d be reserved for the original \u201ctype\u201d occurrence at the Ries impact structure (Grieve and Therriault, 2012; Osinski et al., 2016, 2020a). An additional complication to the understanding of melt-bearing breccias is that there is likely a continuum from melt-free lithic impact breccia to impact melt rock (see next section) endmembers, with impact melt-bearing breccias representing much of continuum. Current classification schemes do not currently account for this.\n\n\n10.1.3\nImpact melt rocks\nImpact melt rocks form by adiabatic decompression from a high shocked compressed state, resulting in superheated conditions and can contain abundant rock and mineral clasts (Dence, 1971; Osinski et al., 2018). This is in contrast to endogenic igneous rocks, which form by flux melting or adiabatic decompression from depth, producing partial melting under liquidus temperature conditions, in specific geodynamical environments and without rock and mineral clasts (Osinski et al., 2018). Impact melt rocks can be subdivided into clast-rich (e.g., Figs. 14a,b), clast-poor (Fig. 14c), or clast-free (Fig. 14d) (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). They can be further sub-classified based on the degree of crystallinity as glassy, hypocrystalline, or holocrystalline, and according to the groundmass texture as aphanitic, phaneritic, vesicular or particulate (Osinski et al., 2008a). Impact melt rocks have been documented in approximately one-third (57) of terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters (Appendix A).\nImpact melt rocks share many textural similarities with volcanic rocks, both in outcrop and under the microscope (Fig. 15), with characteristic features such as columnar joints (Fig. 15e) and vesicles (Fig. 15d) being common. Such similarities offer a partial explanation for the original interpretation of many complex impact structures as cryptovolcanic structures (see Section 4.1). As with melt-bearing breccias, lithological terms defined at specific impact craters, such as dellenite, k\u00e4rn\u00e4ite, and tagamite, and more general terms, such \u201cimpact melt breccia\u201d \u2013 which is more accurately \u201cclast-rich impact melt rock\u201d \u2013 have been used to describe terrestrial impact melt rocks in the literature. These terms should be avoided as they are impractical and have led to misuse and confusion in the literature (Osinski et al., 2008a; Reimold and Gibson, 2005).\nOnce thought to be absent in impact structures formed in predominantly sedimentary targets, it is now clear that impact melt-bearing breccias (Section 10.1.2) and impact melt rocks are generated during such impacts (Osinski et al., 2008b). What is clear, however, is that the products are different in their appearance and characteristics, with impact melt rocks in sedimentary target rocks being typically more clast-rich and unusual in colour (Fig. 15b). The demonstration that melt is produced irrespective of target lithology is consistent with thermodynamic numerical models that indicate that as much, or more, melt should be produced in sedimentary compared to crystalline target rocks (Kieffer and Simonds, 1980; W\u00fcnnemann et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n10.2\nImpactites based on setting\n\n10.2.1\nAutochthonous impactites\nAutochthonous (also referred to as authigenic in the literature) impactites refer to impactites formed in their present location and that have undergone no transport during crater excavation. They comprise crater rims, in both simple and complex impact structures (Fig. 16\n) (Table 9), can be faulted and fractured, but they retain their pre-impact stratigraphic relations to surrounding rocks (Grieve and Therriault, 2012). As noted above, there are some contradictions in the literature about the definition of impactites, but autochthonous impactites comprise shocked rocks but that lack any unequivocal shock effects.\n\n\n10.2.2\nParautochthonous impactites\nImpactites that have been transported by the cratering flow field but that appear to be \u201cin place\u201d are termed parautochthonous (St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). They are intermediate between autochthonous (see above) and allochthonous (see next section) impactites. Parautochthonous impactites comprise the floors of simple and complex impact craters (Figs. 16a, b), and the central uplifts of complex craters (Fig. 16b) (Table 9) (Grieve and Therriault, 2012). Indeed, despite significant displacement during the modification stage of crater formation, reaching many km in large complex impact craters, parautochthonous impactites in central uplifts retain their broad pre-impact stratigraphic relationships to surrounding rocks (Kenkmann et al., 2014). Notwithstanding the above noted issues in terminology, parautochthonous impactites comprise shocked rocks or poorly sorted monomict impact breccias with angular clasts (Grieve and Therriault, 2012). The Impact Earth Database shows that shock effects are common in parautochthonous impactites (Appendix A), in particular central uplifts, with shatter cones and PDFs in quartz being common (e.g., Fig. 5b).\n\n\n10.2.3\nAllochthonous impactites\n\nAllochthonous (also referred to as allogenic in the literature) impactites are those formed elsewhere and subsequently transported to their current location. They are by far the most variable and varied impactites in terms of both lithological character and setting. They can be found in four settings in both simple and complex craters (Fig. 16) (Table 9): (1) as crater-fill deposits in the crater interior, (2) as injection dykes in the crater floor, (3) as proximal ejecta deposits, and (4) as distal ejecta deposits.\n\n\nCrater-fill impactites:\n Approximately three quarters of hypervelocity impact craters on Earth preserve some portion of their crater-fill impactites (Appendix A). Crater-fill impactites cover up to half of the rim to floor depth in simple craters (Melosh, 1989) (Fig. 16). In complex craters, their thickness increases with the size of the crater (Fig. 15), ranging up to an ~5\u00a0km thick sequence of impactites at the ~200\u00a0km diameter Sudbury impact structure (Dreuse et al., 2010; Therriault et al., 2002). Lithic impact breccias are the most widely documented, occurring in 128 craters, followed by impact melt-bearing breccias (78), and then impact melt rocks (57). Only 35 structures preserve all three of these impactite types. At these sites, there is a general progression upwards from lithic impact breccias, to impact melt-bearing breccias, to impact melt rocks (cf., Dressler and Reimold, 2001; Grieve et al., 1977; Osinski and Grieve, 2012). There are two important points that warrant discussion with respect to impact melt rocks. First, the term \u201cimpact melt sheet\u201d is often applied to crater-fill impact melt rocks, with the implication that there is a continuous \u201csheet\u201d of impact melt rock in the crater interior (cf., fresh lunar craters, e.g., Figs. 3b\u2013d). However, it is apparent from the Impact Earth database that only the West Clearwater, Manicouagan, and Sudbury impact structures preserve unambiguous impact melt \u201csheets\u201d. In many craters where a melt sheet would be expected given their size, there is either insufficient data at present to make a conclusive determination (e.g., Chicxulub), or the impact melt rocks occur as lenses intercalated with impact melt-bearing and lithic impact breccias (e.g., Popigai). This leads on to the second important point, which is that impact melt rocks are either lacking entirely, or are volumetrically minor, in craters formed in mixed sedimentary \u2013 crystalline targets (e.g., Ries, Steen River). Instead, the crater-fill impactites are dominated by impact melt-bearing breccias. This has been previously noted and is ascribed as being due to the presence of sedimentary rocks in the target rocks (Osinski et al., 2008a); although the exact reason for this remains poorly understood.\n\n\nDykes:\n Dykes of impact melt rocks, impact melt-bearing breccias, lithic impact breccias, and pseudotachylite occur in the crater floor and central uplifts of many hypervelocity impact craters (Fig. 16) (Appendix A). Insight into impact dykes have benefited from studies of partly to deeply eroded impact structures, where, as noted above, they are often the only impactites left preserved. In general, impact dykes are typically less than a few m wide and a few m long (Dressler and Reimold, 2004; Osinski et al., 2018). While various mechanisms have been proposed for the origin and emplacement of dykes in hypervelocity impact craters, they generally fall into two main categories. Most impact melt rocks, impact melt-bearing breccias, and lithic impact breccias are interpreted to have been injected into fracture systems \u2013 either caused by the impact or pre-existing weaknesses \u2013 although there is considerable debate at which point in the cratering process this occurs (Dressler and Reimold, 2004). Pseudotachylite on the other hand is generally thought to represent melt generated in situ (e.g., O'Callaghan et al., 2016; Reimold, 1995; Thompson and Spray, 1996), although again there is considerable debate as to when in the cratering process this occurs.\nDykes at a much greater scale, up to 10s of metres wide and several kilometres long, have been observed at the two largest hypervelocity impact craters on Earth: Sudbury (e.g., Pilles et al., 2018; Wood and Spray, 1998) and Vredefort (e.g., Lieger and Riller, 2012; Reimold and Gibson, 2006). These so-called Offset Dykes at the Sudbury impact structure are connected to the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC), the up to ~5\u00a0km-thick impact melt sheet. While most authors agree that the Offset Dykes represent impact melt injected into fractures in the crater floor, the timing of emplacement of these dykes is still unclear. Some authors have proposed that the dykes formed from an injection during the excavation stage before differentiation occurred in the Sudbury Igneous Complex (Tuchscherer and Spray, 2002), others have suggested multiple injection events during the excavation and modification stages (Lightfoot and Farrow, 2002; Murphy and Spray, 2002; Rickard and Watkinson, 2001). More recent studies have supported a single injection event following the modification stage for the Foy Offset Dyke (Pilles et al., 2018).\n\n\nProximal ejecta deposits:\n Proximal ejecta deposits are defined as material that has been transported beyond the rim of the transient cavity, within five crater radii of the source crater (Grieve and Therriault, 2004; St\u00f6ffler and Grieve, 2007). Impact ejecta deposits are the first impactite type to be eroded and few proximal ejecta deposits are preserved around hypervelocity impact craters on Earth, with only 15 possible examples (Appendix A). In contrast, due to their young age, all impact craters preserve some portion of their ejecta deposits (Appendix A). Like their planetary counterparts, all terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters possess a continuous ejecta deposit commonly referred to as an \u201cejecta blanket\u201d (Melosh, 1989) (Fig. 15). These continuous ejecta blankets comprise melt-free lithic impact breccias to melt-poor impact melt-bearing breccias (Osinski et al., 2012a) and form via ballistic sedimentation and radial flow during the excavation stage of crater formation (H\u00f6rz et al., 1977; Oberbeck, 1975). Most complex hypervelocity impact craters on Earth also preserve a second patchy layer of impact melt-bearing breccias and\/or impact melt rock overlying the continuous ejecta blanket (Osinski et al., 2011) (Fig. 16). The presence of a second layer of melt-rich material is also common to the other rocky planets, the Moon, and large asteroids and has been explained by a second major pulse of impact ejecta emplacement during the final modification stage of crater formation (Osinski et al., 2011).\nIn smaller simple craters, impact melt has also been documented as isolated glass fragments not contained in a breccia (\u201cmelt beads\u201d) (e.g., at the Aouelloul, Barringer, Henbury, Kamil, Odessa, and Wabar craters). In marine and submarine impact structures, resurge deposits, which contain reworked impact material, can fill completely the cavity, and extend beyond the rims, for example at the Lockne (Sj\u00f6qvist et al., 2016) and Chesapeake Bay (Poag et al., 2004) impact structures. It is worth noting that these deposits do not constitute primary ejecta deposits.\n\n\nDistal ejecta deposits:\n Distal ejecta deposits form beyond 5 crater radii of the source crater, up to a global dispersion (Fig. 16). The majority of distal ejecta deposits comprise tektites and spherules, described in Sections 5.4.1. and 5.4.2., respectively.\nFinally, as noted at the outset of this contribution, in the past couple of decades it has been recognized that the majority of craters on Earth above a few km in diameter have generated local hydrothermal systems (e.g., Kirsim\u00e4e and Osinski, 2012; Naumov, 2005; Osinski et al., 2013). Such systems are important for astrobiology (Osinski et al., 2020c) and economic geology (Grieve, 2012), and result in alteration of impactites, complicating our understanding of impact cratering processes and products. The description of hydrothermal alteration products in terrestrial craters, however, is outside the scope of this contribution and the reader is referred to reviews by Naumov (2005), Kirsim\u00e4e and Osinski (2012), Osinski et al. (2013) and references, therein.\n\n\n\n10.3\nImpactites in marine impacts\nWhen an impact event occurs in a marine environment, seawater is rapidly expelled radially from the cavity, while ejecta deposits are forming. Water then rushes back into the structure, eroding the recently ejected material and converging at the center of the crater, which results in a central water plume that subsequently collapses and produces an outward flow, followed by oscillating impact-triggered tsunami waves (Dypvik and Jansa, 2003; Orm\u00f6 et al., 2007). As a result, the products of marine impacts contain reworked impact-generated and sedimentary material, and usually display an upward fining and a transition into post-impact sedimentary conditions. In smaller marine craters (e.g., the 14\u00a0km diameter Lockne impact structure), the resurge of seawater into the crater cavity immediately after the impact resulted in the primary impactites being immediately reworked, such that in their place is a series of sedimentary rocks containing primary impact material (Sturkell, 1998). This eroded, transported, and redeposited material does not strictly conform the current definition of impactites.\nSimilar to impacts into sedimentary rocks, it was thought that impact melt was not produced in marine impacts in any significant quantity; however, as pointed out by Dypvik and Jansa (2003), this is not the case and impact melt rocks and impact melt-bearing breccias are present in a number of marine impact craters (see Appendix A). As with subaerial impacts, the volumes of impact melt rocks and impact melt-bearing breccias increases with crater size for marine impact craters. In the past decade it has also been recognized that for large marine impacts, as exemplified by Chicxulub and Sudbury, the presence of such large volumes of impact melt results in explosive molten-fuel-coolant interaction (MFCI), analogous to what occurs during phreatomagmatic volcanic eruptions (Grieve et al., 2010; Osinski et al., 2020c). This process fractures and disperses the melt to form a series of well sorted glass-rich deposits (Fig. 17\n) that bear little resemblance to the products of impacts in continental setting. These lithologies are not accounted for in current classification schemes for impactites and may not actually conform to the definition of an impactite.\n\n\n\n11\nConcluding remarks\nIt can be reasoned that the impact of extraterrestrial objects with planetary bodies is one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous geological processes in the Solar System, with implications for the origin and evolution of planets and of life itself. One of the main approaches to understanding the impact cratering process and its products and effects is the geological record on Earth. In this contribution, we have conducted a comprehensive review of the terrestrial impact record. In addition to being presented here, this database is provided via the Impact Earth website (http:\/\/www.impactearth.com) that will be continually updated in order to provide a living resource for those who wish to track what has changed over time. In addition, given the shear breadth of the literature on terrestrial impacts, we acknowledge that there will be omissions and even errors in this database and we welcome input from the community to ensure that the Impact Earth database is kept as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nWe hope that the definitions and criteria for how impact craters, hypervelocity impact craters, and impact deposits on Earth can be confirmed will be useful for experienced and new impact researchers alike. It is our goal that by publishing this database, that it will enable and encourage renewed interest and research on the impact record of Earth, in particular in the field investigation of craters and in the laboratory analysis of samples, which has diminished in recent years. We have barely scratched the surface of what this database can tell us about impact cratering processes and products, yet even our high-level examination presented here has yielded important new information, for example, on the simple-to-complex crater transition diameter and the nature of complex craters on Earth.\nWith the ongoing robotic exploration of two impact craters on Mars (Gale and Jezero) and the imminent prospect of humans conducting fieldwork once again on the heavily cratered lunar surface, it is our hope that as happened during Apollo, that the exploration of the Moon, Mars and other Solar System bodies will occur hand in hand with the exploration of the impact record here on Earth.\n\n","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nA landslide inventory is a database of the location of past landslides and their characteristics. It may contain a unique identification code for each landslide recorded and related information about type of landslide, state of activity, date of occurrence and material involved (Galli et al., 2008; Herv\u00e1s and Bobrowsky, 2009). The inventory may be polygonal or point-based and it may correspond to an event-based inventory, in which all landslides share the same and simultaneous trigger, such as a storm or an earthquake (Iadanza et al., 2016; Cama et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2019; Loche et al., 2022b). The alternative can encompass landslides with a ill-defined time of occurrence, which one would refer to as geomorphological inventory (Guzzetti et al., 2012).\nNational landslide inventories are geomorphological inventories in most cases. They may cover wide areas and thus, may require different data (orthophotos or satellite images) and\/or research groups to undertake the mapping effort. Unfortunately, when different data and\/or groups are involved in the task, each output inventory inevitably suffers from the different quality and completeness (Guzzetti et al., 2012; Tanyas and Lombardo, 2020; Pokharel et al., 2021) brought by some degree of subjectivity. For instance, some areas may be preferentially mapped, either for a specific choice, a topographic limitation, or for other reasons (Bornaetxea et al., 2018; Bornaetxea and Marchesini, 2021).\nFor example, Devoli et al. (2015) showed a significant presence of landslides around the Norwegian road network, for mapping at national scale is mostly undertaken by road authorities. The same preferential mapping was noted by Steger et al. (2021) in northern Italy or by Tanyas et al. (2022) in eastern Turkey. Steger et al. (2016a) investigated bias effects due to specific land cover types, and Steger et al. (2016b) explored the same issue over a large portion of the Austrian territory, further extended to the whole Austria by Lima et al. (2017, 2021). Van Den Eeckhaut et al. (2012) and Kirschbaum et al. (2015) made similar considerations for the European and Global landslide catalogues, respectively. More recently, this topic has been also examined for the whole Chinese territory by Lin et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2022), who stressed the negative influence of an incomplete landslide inventory and the necessity to find ways to reduce the propagation of this spatial bias onto the final susceptibility map. Notably, recent technological developments are contributing to reduce this issues through accurate aerial photograph interpretation (Karakas et al., 2021) and automated landslide mapping routines (Meena et al., 2022).\nNevertheless, in situations like Italy, where the national inventory is compiled by several groups and thus likely using different criteria, some degree of spatial biases are to be expected. Trigila et al. (2010) discussed the quality of the Italian Landslide Inventory (known as IFFI, Trigila et al., 2007) and its completeness for individual administrative regions. However, few articles have used the IFFI information for susceptibility purposes. Iadanza et al. (2016) and Segoni et al. (2015) used it as a reference to extract rainfall triggering thresholds, whereas Bianchini et al. (2013) and H\u00f6lbling et al. (2012) used it to validate slope deformation detected through persistent scatterer interferometry. Colombo et al. (2005) adopted it to empirically study the hazard in the north\u2013western Italian sector corresponding to the Piedmont region. Recently, Alvioli et al. (2021) adopted a subset of IFFI to partially validate simulations of rockfall trajectories. Only one case exists where the authors considered the whole IFFI at the national scale (Marchesini et al., 2014), and only for validation, not for training a model.\nOverall, the geomorphological literature lacks a unified\/objective approach on how to deal with the propagation inventory biases to the resulting landslide susceptibility maps. The procedure presented in Steger et al. (2021) is currently the most comprehensive, and we will take inspiration from it in this work.\nIn terms of modeling approaches, the literature on landslide susceptibility features a large number of modeling techniques. The most common approach still belongs to the binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) or, as more specifically referred, to the Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) case, as also reported by Lombardo and Mai (2018) and Reichenbach et al. (2018). This method assumes that the distribution of landslide presences and absences across the geographic space can be explained according to a Bernoulli exponential distribution. The influence of the covariates is then captured via linear relationships. This is usually implemented in a frequentist approach with good performances (e.g.\nYesilnacar and Topal, 2005; Nefeslioglu et al., 2008; Rossi et al., 2010), which justifies the use of such a relatively simple model. Nevertheless, more complex statistical models are available nowadays, and they allow one to explore whether nonlinear relations between landslides and landscape characteristics exist. This is the case of the most common extension of the GLM framework, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), already appeared in a number of applications (Goetz et al., 2011; Petschko et al., 2012; Goetz et al., 2021). However, even in such case, the frequentist framework does not allow to naturally account for uncertainties, which instead is an essential part of a Bayesian counterpart (Korup, 2021; Lombardo and Tanyas, 2021).\nFew landslide susceptibility studies feature a Bayesian implementation. Das et al. (2012) show one example of Bayesian GLM to assess the landslide susceptibility in the proximity of roads in a Indian case study. Analogous examples can be found more recently at catchment (Lombardo et al., 2020b; Luo et al., 2021) and regional scale assessments (Tanyas et al., 2021; Loche et al., 2022a). Moreover, Lombardo et al. (2018a, 2019) proposed an extension of the Bayesian workflow pursued by the authors mentioned above by using a Log\u2013Gaussian Cox Process to predict landslide counts per mapping unit, this being implemented in R\u2013INLA (Lindgren and Rue, 2015; Bakka et al., 2018).\nUltimately, another non\u2013standardized approach in landslide science pertains to the way the space is partitioned i.e., which mapping unit is adopted. The vast majority of literature contributions opt for a regular mesh or grid\u2013cell based subdivision (Sala et al., 2021; Arnone et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017) whereas other researchers use Slope-Units (SU, Schl\u00f6gel et al., 2018; Tanyas et al., 2019a, 2019b; Alvioli et al., 2021, 2022) or in fewer cases for other terrain unit subdivisions (Z\u00eazere et al., 2004); Z\u00eazere et al., 2017). Even more rarely, the differences induced by one or the other spatial partition are discussed (Erener and D\u00fczg\u00fcn, 2012; Alvioli et al., 2018; Ba et al., 2018; Jacobs et al., 2020; Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2020).\nThe grid cell\u2013based partition type is regular, easy\u2013to\u2013use, and it usually subdivides the landscape at a fine to very fine resolution. It is convenient because its resolution often coincides with satellite\u2013derived data, but it leads to some operational issues. For instance, when a susceptible grid cell is surrounded by non\u2013susceptible ones (Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2020), it is not straightforward to make decisions for landslide risk reduction nor for structural slope design. Conversely, SU result from geomorphological processes which shape the landscape as much as the landslides, and have a physical correspondence on the terrain. Being medium\u2013coarse in resolution, they require an aggregation step of the quantities one usually derives from satellite data. Moreover, they intrinsically express the morphodynamic behavior of a failing slope, thus SU can be easily interpreted for master planning purposes. As a result of these advantages, although grid cells are still predominant in the literature, the number of SU\u2013based applications has seen a constant increase in recent years, especially after automated and open access tools for SU delineation have been made available to the community (see, Alvioli et al., 2016). Considerations on the advantage of SU over grid-cells have been extensively discussed in Reichenbach et al. (2018).\nIn this work, we investigate the landslide susceptibility of the Italian territory considering the three aspects mentioned above: spatial homogeneity\/heterogeneity of landslide inventories, a solid approach to the susceptibility estimation, and the use of SU as geomorphologically\u2013sound mapping units. Specifically, we focus on examining possibly incomplete landslide inventories and develop a selection procedure to ensure that the bias they may generate would not propagate onto the final susceptibility maps. We do so within a GAM\u2013type model built over a SU partition of Italy. In doing so, we examine the (linear\/nonlinear) covariate effects out of a suite of models that also feature an uncertainty estimation phase.\n\n\n2\nStudy area\nThe geomophology of Italy is unique and extremely diverse. Soldati and Marchetti (2017) prepared an outstanding compendium and overall description, where the national settings are dissected per region, geological history and anthropic influence.\n\nFig. 1\n summarizes the large scale geomorphological and geological settings of the country. The great variety of morphological features is the result of an active geodynamic environment (Bosellini, 2017; Bartolini, 2010; Cowie et al., 2017), which determines a considerable variety in terms of outcropping lithologies (Bini, 2013). From a macroscopic, general and a naturalistic point of view, at least seven main geomorphological domains can be identified in Italy (Alps, Apennines, Po river alluvial plain, volcanoes, coasts, Sicily and Sardinia). This subdivision, however, is not able to depict the geomorphological differences that exist within these domains (Fredi and Lupia Palmieri, 2017).\nIn a recent work, Alvioli et al. (2020) proposed a subdivision of the Italian territory into more than 300,000 Slope Units. In the same work, they analyzed the lithological and morphometric characteristics of 439 watersheds, of comparable size, covering the whole national territory and including the SU. A clustering procedure allowed Alvioli et al. (2020) to define seven different classes, characterized by different combinations of lithotypes and morphometries. These classes were found to correlate well with terrain elevation and other pre\u2013existing morphological classifications of the territory (Guzzetti and Reichenbach, 1994; Dr\u0103gu\u0163 and Eisank, 2012). It is interesting to observe the spatial distribution of polygons belonging to the seven classes (see Fig. 12\nAlvioli et al., 2020). Although some of them are present mainly in specific geographical areas (e.g., the Alps), many others are widespread in different locations (from south to north and even on islands) and thus capture the geomorphological diversity mentioned by Fredi and Lupia Palmieri (2017).\nMorphology and lithology are widely used in the literature to explain the spatial occurrence of landslides (Reichenbach et al., 2018). Consequently, in the remainder of this paper, we assumed that landslide information from the IFFI inventories should be quantitatively comparable within the same class although located in different regions of the country.\n\n2.1\nLandslide inventory\nIFFI is a landslide inventory maintained and updated through collaboration between national, regional and provincial institutions (Trigila et al., 2010). It contains more than 600,000 landslides, with a total density of about 2 landslides per square kilometer and with occurrence dates ranging from the year 1116 to 2020. The information contained in the database was obtained through different methods and approaches including photo-interpretation, analysis of pre-existing data, and field survey. For this work, we used the full IFFI dataset made available through the IdroGEO platform (Iadanza et al., 2021) and integrated with the IFFI data provided by the Tuscany Region (since they were missing in the IdroGEO platform). In particular, we used IFFI point data, in which landslides are represented as points located on the highest part of the landslide polygons (when this polygon information is present) or simply represent the position of the landslide (when the landslide is small and\/or polygon information is not available).\nAccording to the IFFI catalogue (https:\/\/www.progettoiffi.isprambiente.it\/en\/) landslides are non\u2013uniformly distributed over Italy.\n\nFig. 2\n shows that mass movements are particularly dense in the Lombardia (LOM) region, and where the Alpine environment locally dominates the landscape. Moreover, a less dense but still large presence of landslides well aligns along the Appenine chain from the North to Central Italy, while landslide density appears to decrease in the South.\nIn the Apulia (PUG) region, this appears quite reasonable, for the landscape is relatively gentle. However, the IFFI inventory strikingly characterize Calabria (CAL) Sicilia (SIC) and Sardegna (SAR) as scarce in number of landslides. This may be already an indication of a uneven inventory. For example, in Sicily, IFFI reports 4571 landslides out of which 48 are classified as rapid flows. Yet, several studies have reported for the same region a much larger number of superficial and fast mass movements. For instance, Bout et al. (2018); Van den Bout et al. (2021) modeled 395 debris flows only within the extremely small catchment of Itala, north-eastern SIC. Right next to Itala, Ardizzone et al. (2012) also mapped several hundreds of debris flows within the Briga and Giampilieri catchments. Similarly, Cama et al. (2017) mapped 810 debris flows in the small catchment of Saponara, on the other side of the Peloritan belt. More generally, Ciampalini et al. (2015) recognized diffused superficial deformations consistent with shallow landslides, over the whole Messina province. Thus, there maybe significant discrepancies between the information contained in the IFFI inventory and reality.\nDespite local differences in terms of landslide distribution per region, the mapping criterion behind the IFFI record is to assign a landslide type to each mass movement. This follows a non\u2013standard geomorphological description of the failing mass by reporting the failing mechanism and the velocity of the moving mass (sensu Hungr et al., 2014). This leads to eight landslide types summarized as follows:\n\n1.\n\nComplex: this type includes landslides for which more than one failure mechanism was recognized. It corresponds to the Complex type described by Varnes (1978).\n\n\n2.\n\nDSGSD: this type corresponds to deep\u2013seated landslides described by Guerricchio et al. (2012).\n\n\n3.\n\nDiffused Fall: this type does not strictly correspond to a single landslide type but combines Falls and Topples. Those who mapped the phenomena, could only recognise the talus without being able to discriminate the initiation mechanism. Thus, a \u201cDiffused\u201d type was created within the IFFI inventory to mark the two uncertain initiation processes.\n\n\n4.\n\nFall: this type corresponds to the Falls described in Varnes (1978).\n\n\n5.\n\nRapid Flow: this type encompasses flow\u2013like mass movements, usually in unconsolidated materials and corresponds to the landslides characterized by a rapid to extremely rapid motion as reported in Hungr et al. (2014).\n\n\n6.\n\nShallow: this type consists of non-deep mass movements which are usually triggered by strong meteorological stresses which result in gravel\/sand\/debris slide activations as described in Hungr et al. (2014).\n\n\n7.\n\nSlow Flow: this type encompasses mass movements with a slow motion usually involving clayey material. It corresponds to the dry (or non-liquefied) sand\/silt\/gravel\/debris flow and lateral spreading types described in Hungr et al. (2014).\n\n\n8.\n\nTranslational: this type includes both the translational and rotational sliding as per Hungr et al. (2014).\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3\n shows a stacked bar plot summarizing the regional distribution of the eight types of landslides listed above. The relative distribution of landslide types in different regions is very heterogeneous. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows that in some regions certain landslide types are absent, or present in negligible quantities. One of the possible causes of this strong difference between regions can be linked to the physical characteristics of the territories. Certain types of landslides can only occur where given geomorphological conditions exist. However, among the causes of this heterogeneity, one may also consider the poor quality and completeness of the inventories, perhaps linked to deficiencies in terms of recognition, mapping and classification of landslides.\n\n\n2.2\nMapping units\nThe SU partition used in this work was first presented in Alvioli et al. (2020). There, the authors use the r.slopeunits software (Alvioli et al., 2016) to delineate SU over the whole Italy. The SU dataset (https:\/\/geomorphology.irpi.cnr.it\/tools\/slope-units) contains 325,578 slope unit polygons of varying shape and size. Each polygon is intended to encompass locally homogeneous terrain, from the aspect direction point of view, and thus it corresponds to a hillslope in the real world. The software used to delineate the polygons is adaptive, as it singles out SU of different size in different geographical locations. Its input parameters are optimized using only elevation data. In particular, no landslide nor other terrain information enter the slope unit delineation procedure. This makes the SU map adopted in this work completely independent from the landslide inventory itself, and strongly related to the underlying topography, nation\u2013wide.\nWe stress here that Alvioli et al. (2020) constrained the SU delineation to remove flat or near\u2013flat areas, obtaining a spatial partition associated with landslides, i.e., slopes. This is also a criterion which has already appeared in other studies (e.g.\nTanyas et al., 2019a, 2019b) to focus the predictive model on slopes where instabilities may be expected uniquely on the basis or topographic roughness and to limit the dataset in size to those areas which require attention.\nThe resulting SU cover 224,032\u00a0km2 out of the total 301,093\u00a0km2 of the Italian territory. This indication in itself stresses that 77% of the country is topographically rough and potentially prone to landslide just from a simple physiographic criterion.\nNotably, combining the IFFI inventory and the SU, each landslide type has a different number of SU where at least one landslide fell into, which we report here: 26,960 Complex, 1534 DSGSD, 14,960 Diffused Falls, 13,202 Falls, 16,478 Rapid Flows, 21,173 Shallow, 28,540 Slow Flows and 52,587 Translational landslides.\n\n\n2.3\nExplanatory variables\nDue to the large size of the study area, and to the different types of landslides, we selected a large suite of explanatory variables (covariates hereafter) to support the model training phase. A sub\u2013set of the covariate set corresponds to terrain characteristics reported in landslide susceptibility studies (Budimir et al., 2015). To those, we added few more properties to describe the lithological and pedological signal across Italy, as well as the shape characteristics of the SU partition.\nIn Table 1\n we list the whole set of covariates used to describe the landslide distribution across Italy. Notably, as also mentioned in Section 1, the use of SU requires an aggregation step to convert the distribution of covariates from the grid cell level to the SU level. Specifically, we used mean and standard deviation \u2013 rarely this is also done by considering a quantile description of the covariates (Castro Camilo et al., 2017; Amato et al., 2019). We opted to use the mean and standard deviation assuming these two statistical moments to be sufficient in describing the covariate distribution per mapping unit (see Lombardo and Tanyas, 2020). We used all the covariates as linear effects, with the exception of few cases, which are reported in Table 1, and for which we used non\u2013linear effects; we provide an explanation on what this implies in Section 3.\nBelow we provide a further description of the covariates listed in Table 1. Geomorphologically, we included Slope, Aspect (in its continuous form through Eastness and Northness), Curvatures, Relative Slope Position and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). These were computed from the 25\u00a0m DEM of Italy, EU-DEM, from Copernicus (https:\/\/hub.sieusoil.eu\/record\/basic\/5e1282af-9890-4a3d-86cb-174a0a000073).\nPedologically and, to some extent, lithologically, we considered soil attributes at 250\u00a0m resolution, obtained from Soilgrids global datasets (Hengl et al., 2017).\nIn addition, we believe that the shape of a SU itself may have an impact on landslide susceptibility, especially in this research, which aims at distinguishing several types of mass movements. To this end, we considered the Maximum Distance within an SU, calculated from the highest to the lowest point along an SU boundary. Similarly, we also computed a roundness\/elongation index, computed as the Maximum Distance divided by the square root of the SU area. This index represents wide SU when the ratio returns small values, and more and more elongated SU as the ratio increases.\nUltimately, we initially used the administrative regions partitioning the country as an additional covariate, under the assumption that each region separately carries a potentially biasing signal due to the mapping procedure adopted among different administrations.\nFurther details on the actual implementation and covariates' use are provided in the following Section.\n\n\n\n3\nBayesian generalized additive model\n\n3.1\nBayesian models and inference with R-INLA\nWe use Bayesian modeling, in the software R, with the R-package INLA (Rue et al., 2009).\nBayesian modeling means that we have a prior probability distribution on all parameters, and after we make observations, we get posterior probability distributions on these parameters. Specifying the priors is part of model building, and can either be done by giving priors that have very little information in them, as in this paper, or priors that are based on expert knowledge. To get a point estimate for a parameter, we find the mean of the posterior distribution, and to get the uncertainty, we find e.g. the 95% credible interval (CI), meaning an interval between the 2.5% quantile and the 97.5% quantile.\nINLA is a popular tool for specifying and inferring Bayesian models, and is used in a wide range of relevant applications (Opitz et al., 2018; Pimont et al., 2021; Titti et al., 2021). INLA is short for Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations, which describes the technical details on how to compute results in a fast way.\n\n\n3.2\nModel setup\nWe model the presence\/absence of landslides y through the Binomial likelihood,\n\n(1)\n\n\ny\ni\n\n\u223c\nBinomial\n\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n\n\nwhere p\n\ni\n is the Binomial probability. We model p\n\ni\n through the frequently used logit link function,\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03b7\ni\n\n=\n\n\np\ni\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\np\ni\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nand refer to \u03b7 as the predictor. The predictor is where we model the relationship between the landslide occurrence and the covariates. We do this by specifying one effect, or model component, per covariate, and then adding these effects together. Let\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03b7\ni\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n1\n\n\nx\n1\n\n\ni\n\n+\n\u2026\n+\n\n\u03b2\nm\n\n\n\nx\nm\n\n\ni\n\n+\n\nu\n1\n\n\n\nregion\ni\n\n\n+\n\nu\n2\n\n\ni\n\n+\n\nu\n3\n\n\ni\n\n+\n\nu\n4\n\n\ni\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b2\n\nj\n\nx\n\nj\n are the linear effect, describing the linear relationship of the covariates x\n\nj\n and the predictor. For \u03b2\n\nj\n we use the default priors in INLA, which are uninformative flat priors.\nFor u\n1, we specify a random intercept model, called an iid-model in INLA,\n\n\n\nu\n1\n\n\n\nregion\ni\n\n\n\u223c\nN\n\n0\n\n\u03c3\nu\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that we estimate one regression constant for each Italian region, independently from each other.\nFor u\n2, u\n3, and u\n4 we use the spline known in INLA as the random walk order 1 spline. We have spline models on the covariates MD for u\n2, MD\/\n\n\nArea\n\n for u\n3, and Mean Slope for u\n4 (see Table 1 for acronyms' reference). For each spline, the covariate is divided into 20 intervals, and the vector of v\n\nj\n\u00a0=\u00a0u\nspline(interval\nj\n) for j\u00a0=\u00a01, \u2026, 20, assumes the form\n\n(4)\n\n\nv\n\ni\n+\n1\n\n\n=\n\nv\ni\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n\u223c\nN\n\n0\n\n\u03c3\nv\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe prior for \u03c3\n\nu\n and \u03c3\n\nv\n are exponential distributions with mean \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a09.2, chosen based on the penalising complexity framework by Simpson et al. (2017). In addition the spline has been scaled to give better performance during Bayesian inference, according to Rue and Held (2005).\n\n\n3.3\nFit and cross\u2013validation procedure\nWe first fitted an initial reference model using the whole landslide dataset, separately for each landslide type. We did not select a balanced sample, for Petschko et al. (2014); Lombardo and Mai (2018) demonstrated that this operation induces distortions in the global intercept for any susceptibility model. We explored the distribution of the regression coefficients estimated for each region and for each landslide type, and investigated the regions for which the intercepts were consistently negative irrespective of the landslide type. We crossed this information with additional sources of information, to evaluate whether there were regions with a manifestly incomplete inventory.\nOn the basis of the regions we deem to have an incomplete inventory, we run three additional operations, reported below:\n\n\u2022\nWe initially excluded these regions from the analyses, and used the complementary regions, which differ for each landslide type, to calibrate a susceptibility model (bias\u2013reduced model). We validated by implementing a 10-fold cross validation (10-CV), in which each testing subset is mutually exclusive from the remaining nine. In other words, no SU are repeated across CV replicates. This allows one to explore the whole dataset disregarding autocorrelation issues among single CV folds (because same SU may enter different CV-folds).\n\n\n\u2022\nNext, we implemented a simulation stage for which we generated a distribution of 1000 susceptibility estimates for each SU, also for the excluded regions. This simulation phase used the uncertainty estimation obtained from the Bayesian model, ensuring that the uncertainty consistently propagates both in the regions that have rich and poor landslide inventories. Further information on the simulation is in Appendix A.\n\n\n\u2022\nNext, we extracted the mean and the 95% credible interval (CI); the latter is the distance between the 97.5\nth\n and the 2.5\nth\n percentiles of each distribution. Eventually, we prepared raster maps with the mean susceptibility for each landslide type and its uncertainty, for the whole of Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\nPerformance evaluation\nWe assessed the performance of the reference model as well as of the bias\u2013reduced models; cf. Section 3.3. This was achieved considering threshold\u2013independent and threshold\u2013dependent performance metrics, widely used to assess the prediction skills of binary classifiers.\nSpecifically, the binomial GAM returns a distribution of estimated probability values for each SU. From each probability spectrum assigned to a SU, we extracted a single value representing the posterior mean. The ensemble of the posterior means extracted from all of the SU also returns a probability distribution, which we used crossing it with the observed landslide presence\/absence instances to assess the goodness\u2013of\u2013fit and the prediction skill of susceptibility maps prepared here (Rahmati et al., 2019).\nFor each landslide type, we took the corresponding probability distribution assigned at SU level and calculated Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. These are cutoff\u2013independent metrics because the susceptibility spectrum is binarized many times, each time choosing a different probability threshold. Then, for each value of the cutoff, a pair or values is computed by comparing the observed presence\/absence landslide information with respect to the binarized instances. These values consist of False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR), from which the ROC curve can be obtained (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). The numerical integral of the ROC curve is the area under the curve (AUC) and values above 0.5 represent the deviation of the predictions from the random case, i.e., a measure of performance.\nA similar framework is also valid for the cutoff\u2013dependent metrics, with the difference that the cutoff is single\u2013valued. The confusion matrix obtained by comparing predicted and observed presence\/absence instances gives accuracy values for positives and negatives (modeled TP \/ Observed P, modeled TN \/ Observed N). We adopted the median posterior mean of the probability as a cutoff for cutoff\u2013dependent metrics. We choose the median instead of the mean (as in Rossi et al., 2010; Lombardo et al., 2016; Titti et al., 2022), because our dataset is unbalanced (more slope units flagged with landslide absence than presence), resulting in a posterior mean distribution positively skewed (Frattini et al., 2010) rather than being normally distributed around the mean value, if we had a balanced dataset (same, or comparable, number of landslide absences and presences).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nReference model (within-sample)\nThe fitting procedure produced satisfying results with cutoff independent, goodness-of-fit metrics constantly equal or greater than the excellence threshold according to Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000). In Fig. 4\n, we report each ROC curve and AUC value, one for each landslide type. The minimum among all types corresponds to AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.77 for Shallow landslides, whereas the maximum is reached for Diffused Fall, with AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.92.\nAs regards the cutoff\u2013dependent evaluation of the goodness\u2013of\u2013fit, Fig. 5\n shows that accuracy, for the different landslide types, is spread from a minimum near 85% of correctly estimated landslide presences found both for Shallow and Translational to a maximum of 97% for Diffused Fall. These values indicate outstanding goodnees\u2013of\u2013fit performance. As for the capacity of our reference model to label stable SU, the situation is very different. In fact, the percentage of matching cases between the number of observed and estimated SU where landslides are absent is relatively low, going from a minimum of around 44% for Translational to a maximum of 49% for DSGSD. At a superficial level, this should imply that the model performance is insufficient. However, we need to keep in mind that SU have been delineated by removing near\u2013flat areas: i.e., they all represent rough topographies. As a result, a proportion of correctly predicted absences of approximately 50% implies that the model assigned a relatively high susceptibility to a large number of cases where the current observation for these landslide is not to be there. However, this does not mean that they won't occur in the future (or have already occurred but have not been identified and included in the inventory). Hence, the high susceptibility estimates are very reasonable especially in a territory that has been suffering from widespread landsliding as long as these surface processes have been recorded (Rossi et al., 2019; Lombardo et al., 2020a).\n\n4.1.1\nFixed effects\n\nFig. 6\n summarized the estimated fixed effects. The graphical representation of these consists of the marginal distributions for each covariate used linearly in our model, for each landslide type. Further information on the implications and possible interpretation about the sign and range of each distribution will be presented in Section 5.1.1. There, particular attention will be given not only to the sign and range of each fixed effect but also to the relation and possible similarity that types of landslides present with respect to each other.\n\n\n4.1.2\nRandom effects with adjacent\u2013class\u2013dependency\nIn this section we present a graphical summary of the random effects we implemented with a random walk structure. We remind, here, that we applied a random walk to ensure that MD, MD\/\n\nArea\n\n and Mean Slope would retain the ordinal structure of their original continuous distribution (cf. Section 3.2 for definitions).\nEach of the the random effect mentioned above is presented below in Figs. 7, 8 and 9\n\n\n. These highlight their respective nonlinear contribution for each landslide type. Further information on the implications and possible interpretation about these nonlinear effects will be presented in Section 5.1.2. There, particular attention will be given not only to the shape of the nonlinear functions but also to the relation and possible similarity that types of landslides present with respect to each other.\n\n\n4.1.3\nRandom effects with multiple regional intercept\nIn this section we present results obtained using a multiple intercept approach, i.e. calculating an intercept for each region, which helped to asses the level of completeness of the regional landslide inventories.\n\nFig. 10\n shows each multiple intercept. The characteristic that stands out the most is that the credible intervals are extremely narrow, irrespective of landslide type. We observe that the value of the multiple intercept can change significantly within the same region, when different types of landslides are considered. We also note that for some regions, as Piedmont (PIE), Lombardy (LOM) and Liguria (LIG), coefficients are almost always positive, while for Sardinia (SAR) and Apulia (PUG) they are frequently negative. Grey dashed lines in the plots correspond to the zero reference level below which a negative correlation between landslides presence and administrative region exists. Reasons for this negative correlation may be geomorphological (a given type of landslides is not expected in a given region), or caused by the scarce quality and completeness of the regional inventory. Section 4.2 illustrates additional criteria to decide which region had incomplete landslide inventories.\n\n\n\n4.2\nInventory completeness\/incompleteness considerations\nTo understand which regional inventory could be considered complete at a sufficient level, we revised the inventories through random heuristic checks, examined the information provided in technical reports (see here for regional reports and here for the national report), and combined this qualitative expert knowledge together with more quantitative considerations driven by data displayed in Figs. 10 and 11\n.\n\nFig. 11 includes the map resulting from the spatial geomorphological clustering proposed by Alvioli et al. (2020). The seven clusters are representative of geomorphologically and lithologically homogenous conditions across Italy and they are based on the very same SU partition used in this work. From a landslide perspective (including the eight IFFI types), we should expect an analogous signal of landslide densities per clusters, irrespective of the region at hand. This is confirmed, for example, by comparing, at cluster level, the densities of Slow Flow in Basilicata (BAS, southern Italy) with those in Emilia Romagna (EMR, Northern Italy) or the densities of Fall in Sicily (SIC, southern Italy) with those in Trentino Alto-Adige (TAA, Northern Italy). The comparison confirms that in areas that share the same characteristics from a morphological and geological point of view, the density of landslide phenomena of the same type is at least comparable. Thus, we considered an indication for a potentially incomplete inventory any strong deviation from the landslide density distribution in the clusters' polygons, associated with a strong negative intercept in Fig. 10 and through heuristic checks and report descriptions. The results are summarized in Table 2\n, where the teal cells and red cells indicate, respectively, reliable inventories and incomplete inventories and numbers represent the mean value of the multiple intercept values. Hence, for the next modeling procedure, we selected the teal region for training and the red regions for model transferability.\nA quick example of the selection procedure can be seen in the plot concerning Shallow landslides, as shown in Fig. 11. The total height of the bars depends on the landslide density measured in individual clusters, represented with the same colors as in Alvioli et al. (2020). Data show that Shallow landslides occur quite homogeneously in all of the different clusters (apart from a scarce presence in cluster 1). This is confirmed by data of many regions (including BAS, LOM, SIC, CAL, TOS) where, despite the total densities can be different, the ratio between the densities in the different clusters remains quite constant and comparable to the national average. We interpret this behavior as an indication that surface landslides were suitably mapped in these regions. However in other regions (EMR, PUG, SAR, VAO and CAM), information about shallow landslides is very scarce or absent (on all clusters). Since in these regions the values of the multiple coefficient are also negative or very negative, we considered them affected by significant problems of completeness and quality of the shallow landslides inventory. To support this statement, Fig. 11 also reports the number of landslides in the top horizontal axis (note that the count of landslides for EMR is zero).\n\n\n4.3\nFinal fits and simulations\nAfter selecting the regions for which the inventory appeared incomplete, for each landslide type, we fitted a binomial GAM framework on the complementary regions. To test it, we run two complementary procedures. On the one hand, we fitted once again the same models as before (i.e., same covariates, same choice of linear and non\u2013linear effects) but constraining them solely on the regions that we deemed to have a complete, or at least representative, landslide inventory, for each landslide type. This operation ensures the ability to simulate over the regions with incomplete inventories (for more details, see Appendix A). On the other hand, we also performed a standard 10\u2013fold cross\u2013validation procedure using the regions with complete inventories. This operation ensures that we can assess our out\u2013of\u2013sample predictive skill, still within regions where the quality of landslide data is considered reliable.\nBelow, we present the performance, first, and the simulations, later, illustrated with maps.\n\n4.3.1\nCross-validation performance\nIn analogy to the information provided for the reference model, we summarized the ROC curves and their AUC for each landslide type, through a 10-fold CV. Fig. 12\n reports 10 ROC curves, and the corresponding AUC variability. The out\u2013of\u2013sample performance occupies a range between acceptable (0.7 < AUC < 0.8) and excellent (0.8 < AUC < 0.9) binary discrimination, according to Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000), with a minimum mean AUC estimated for Translational landslides at AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.766 (and a very low variability measured in a standard deviation of 0.004). This value is significantly distant from the lower end of the acceptable range and it is actually close to the outstanding one. Similarly, the maximum mean AUC corresponds to AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.887 (standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a00.013). It was estimated for DSGSD and it is close to the outstanding performance class limit (0.9 < AUC < 1.0). This overview highlights suitable and robust out\u2013of\u2013sample performances for models trained within regions where landslide information is at its best within Italy.\nNevertheless, ROC curves and AUC values only provide a lumped overview of model performances, where the returned value is independent from the probability cutoff one may choose. Thus, in analogy to the information provided for the reference model, we also computed the confusion matrix for each of the ten CVs, setting the probability threshold at the posterior median probability. The results, shown in Fig. 13\n, exhibit an interesting behavior, similar to the one we observed in the reference case. Binomial GAM is able to single out very efficiently SU where landslides occurred. This is proved by very high percentages of TP \/ Observed P, always above 80%, irrespective of landslide type. However, when crossing the estimated probabilities with the observed absences, the model seems to perform poorly, both in terms of TN \/ Observed N and in terms of Error Rates. This is a crucial point for us to be shared, for we need to recall that the Slope Unit partition used here does not include any flat or near\u2013flat condition. Therefore, it is specific of rough landscapes where landslides may well occur in the future, but they have just not been observed yet. This may be the reason why locations where landslides are absent may have been estimated with a very high susceptibility, the combination of which is responsible for the low accuracy for the negative instances as well as the high error rates. In other words, when the percentage of TN \/ Observed N is confined between 38% and 50%, irrespective of the landslide type, this implies that our susceptibility models have deemed the complementary 62% and 50% of the examined territory to be prone to slope failures.\n\n\n4.3.2\nSimulations for susceptibility mapping\n\nFigs. 14 and 15\n\n show maps with the results of simulations (cf. Section 3.2). The former corresponds to the mean of the 1000 simulations generated for each landslide type and for each SU. The latter is the width of the 95% CI uncertainty around the mean susceptibility estimates. These two elements represent the variability in how likely a certain landslide type may occur across the Italian territory. Examining Fig. 14 one can clearly see the relative dominant pattern of Diffused Fall, DSGSD, Fall and Rapid Flow types over the Alps. This is a particularly interesting result because we did not strictly use a spatial model. Let us recall that a definition of a spatial model boils down to a model informed of the locations that the response and explanatory variables occupy across the geographic space. For instance, an interpolator is a spatial model by definition because the interpolation routine is based on the distance between a pair or multiple locations where a given process is measured. Here however, our model is not informed of where slope units are located across the Italian territory. Conversely, the only element expressing spatial variation resides in the variation of the binary data and of the covariate domains. In other words, our model is not fully spatial because it does not constrain SU to exhibit susceptibility values that are more similarly within a given neighborhood and are more different for SU that are far apart. Nevertheless, even if the model is not technically a pure spatial model, the way it characterizes the Alps consistently highlights the highest susceptibility estimates for the three landslide types mentioned above. This is a geomorphologically sound result, which well aligns with another observation. In fact, for the Complex, Shallow, Slow Flow and Translational types, the dominant susceptibility pattern in each map corresponds to the Appenine belt.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nAdditional model interpretation\nThis section is subdivided into two, each one presenting the interpretation of each reference model components, these being grouped into linear (fixed) and nonlinear (random) effects.\n\n5.1.1\nInterpretation of fixed effects\nSome interesting patterns arise examining the linear components (cf. Section 3.2) included in our approach. Fig. 6 shows the posterior marginal distributions of each covariate assumed as a linear effect and for each landslide type. Specifically, we displayed the covariates for which the marginal distribution was significant 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the regression coefficient distribution share the same sign for at least one landslide type. The figure summarizes one of the main strengths of a Bayesian susceptibility implementation, for regression coefficients are assigned their posterior mean and its associated uncertainty measured as the 95% credible interval.\nThe fixed effects change in sign and amplitude for different landslide types. And, for landslide type that share some degree similarity, this is much less pronounced than for landslide types with a completely different failure mechanism.\nFor instance, the fixed effects estimated for Fall and Diffused Fall often appear to overlap while markedly differing from Flows and Shallow mass movements. This is the case for Mean Northness where both the posterior distribution of Fall and Diffused Fall are located to the left side of the plot and share a negative regression coefficient, respectively centered at approximately \u22120.06 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.12. Conversely, Translational and Slow Flow were estimated with a positive regression coefficient, respectively centered at around 0.08 and 0.1. These results look reasonable as falls may be influenced by large temperature variations related to the southern orientation (Loche et al., 2021), while Translational movements and Slow Flow may be positively correlated with higher soil moisture, which is favoured by lower solar radiation. Another striking example can be seen in SD of Slope for which the regression coefficient of Fall and Diffused Fall is positive; the existence of a cliff, where these landslides typically occur, implies a large variation in slope steepness within an SU. On the contrary, all the other landslide types are either not affected or even negatively affected by the variation of slope steepness. This is the case for DSGSD, a landslide type with a posterior mean centered at zero, for which the buried failure surface may not be sensitive to variations at the surface. And it is also the case of Rapid Flow, Shallow, Slow Flow and Translational, which share a negative regression coefficient, likely due to the fact that rough SU may host internal barriers opposing the initial failure initiation movement. Such consideration has been reported already in the literature. For instance, Tanyas et al. (2017) showed that frequency of landslides are higher for low roughness values, hence for low SD of Slope. They observed that the frequency proportionally decreases for increasingly rougher topographies, and they justified this observation by assuming that roughness may be a proxy for rocky outcrops, where low SD of Slope implies softer surface materials or soils and high SD of Slope implies rocks or just material with higher geotechnical strength.\nA similar situation, where predominantly superficial landslide behave consistently, exists for the regression coefficients estimated for the mean bulk density (BLDFIE). In this case, Translational, Slow Flow, Shallow and Complex landslides all share a positive marginal effect of BLDFIE on landslide susceptibility (Adams and Sidle, 1987).\nClearly, this level of straightforward interpretation does not apply to every fixed effect and every landslide type. In such a complex model, most of the estimated fixed effect are geomorphologically reasonable and, most importantly, lead to excellent goodness\u2013of\u2013fit performance.\n\n\n5.1.2\nInterpretation of random effects with adjacent-class-dependency\nIn Fig. 7, MD (or the maximum distance within an SU) appears to behave nonlinearly, justifying the choice of the their use as random effects. Looking at the eight trends, it becomes clear that high susceptibility values correspond to large values of the slope units length. However, it is also evident that Complex, Rapid Flow, Slow Flow and Translational have a marked (near exponential) increase in their respective regression coefficient for MD values greater than 10,000\u00a0m. Conversely, DSGSD, Diffused Fall, Fall show a much milder trend, with Shallow being the only landslide type in between the other two groups.\nWe can give a geomorphological interpretation for the observations described above. In fact, complex\/translational movements, slow and rapid flows can be large in size and need relatively large slopes (long, or wide) to occur. Falls and diffused falls can also occur on small slopes. DSGSD mainly depends on the presence of tectonic discontinuities, unloading of glacier retreat and seismic activity, thus being relatively less related to slope size and local morphology and more related to conditions that involved fully-coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of the materials (Segui et al., 2020; Scaringi and Loche, 2022).\nIn Fig. 8, MD\/\n\nArea\n\n (or the elongation\/roundness index of each SU) also appears to behave nonlinearly. Similarly to the previous random effect, the behavior of the SU elongation appears to have some degree of consistency across certain landslide types, such as DSGSD, Diffused Fall, Fall, Rapid Flow and to some extent also Shallow. In these cases, the effect of MD\/\n\nArea\n\n is negligible up to a threshold MD\/\n\nArea\n\n = 4 (we recall here that this index is dimensionless) after which at increasingly elongated SU the probability of the corresponding landslide type would drastically increase.\nElongation of the slope units can be in the direction of the surface drainage, or even perpendicular to that. We observe that Rapid Flow and DSGSD can be correlated with SU parallel to the drainage, while wide and short, steep slopes can accommodate mainly Diffused Fall and Fall.\nConversely, Complex, Slow Flow and Translational landslides share a common behavior and appear to correlate poorly with elongation of the slope units. We conclude that these types of landslides mainly occur inside large semi\u2013circular slopes.\nThe last covariate modeled with a random walk is Mean Slope, for which we also found a nonlinear influence on the estimated susceptibility, irrespective of landslide type. As in the previous cases, more than one landslide type behaves similarly to others. DSGSD and Fall appear to be analogously influenced by the Mean Slope of the SU, with a negative effect which remains essentially constant up to a threshold of approximately 40 degrees, where the regression coefficient drastically increases. As for the remaining landslide types, they all start with a strong negative negative regression coefficient at low values of steepness and they increase sharply up to around 10 degrees, above which the regression coefficient does not exhibit large variations up to 40 degrees. Then, at higher steepness values, they increase again.\nWe believe that negative correlation, with low slope values, and positive correlation, with large slope values, of most landslide types is expected and geomorphologically consistent. The behavior of Fall for low slope values can be ascribed to presence of talus, which can accumulate in almost flat areas.\nThese two type of behaviors of the mean slope steepness in a GAM framework (one smoother and one more sigmoidal in shape) have already been shown in the literature. For instance, Knevels et al. (2020) reports a smooth increase of the regression coefficients which is very similar to the behavior shown in Fig. 9 for Rapid Flow or Diffused Fall. Interestingly, the authors worked in Austria, on the other side of the Italian Alps where rapid flows and diffused falls are mostly concentrated, in Italy.\n\n\n\n5.2\nOverall summary\nMost of the studies of landslide susceptibility existing in the literature typically takes landslide inventories and rely uncritically on them to fit data\u2013driven models. These are often built without questioning their completeness\/incompleteness nor the implications that one or the other would lead to in terms of probabilistic results. This is not the case for a relatively small number of contributions (Steger et al., 2016b; Lima et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Steger et al., 2021; Pokharel et al., 2021) where the bias induced into the susceptibility estimates by incomplete inventories is rigorously researched in depth. However, even the authors mentioned above, have not examined regional biases to the extent we propose here. What they propose is to spatially capturing the source of bias and remove it from the predictive equation by zeroing-out the regression coefficients estimated for the biasing covariate. However, this operation is not the only solution one can opt for.\nOur work takes deep inspiration from the papers cited above, and extends on the framework they propose by first introducing a spatially-varying regression constant examined per regional administration. Then, on the basis of the full distribution of the estimated regression coefficients per region and per landslide type, we carried out an extensive search, both qualitative and quantitative, to select best locations to train a susceptibility model (GAM) and transfer the resulting predictive function onto areas characterized by poor landslide inventories. We also provide a graphical sketch of the modeling design we opted for in Appendix B.\nThe choice of a Bayesian framework also provides further insight into the full posterior distribution per landslide type, allowing for simulating landslide occurrences with a rich probabilistic description, summarized through the mean behavior and its uncertainty. In turn, this allows to provide end users of the susceptibility assessment with a full suite of information upon which they can make decisions.\nIn fact, knowing if a given slope is likely to be unstable on average does not tell the whole story. It is the combination of this information together with the uncertainty level that ensures a much more reliable decision. A slope with a high mean probability of landslide occurrence but with an extremely large uncertainty may not be the right investment for slope stabilization practices. On the contrary, a slope with high mean probability of landslide occurrence, but lower than the ideal one mentioned above, associated with very small uncertainty, may be a safer target for stabilization investments. The same is valid in the opposite situation, a slope with a very low mean susceptibility but with very high uncertainty should not be overlooked, whereas one could safely consider situations where the posterior mean and uncertainty in the susceptibility estimates are both small. In the context of the numerous landslide types we examined, this modeling protocol informs the potential user on the full probabilistic expectation of which mapping unit are unstable to each of the eight types. It is important to stress that usually country-scale susceptibility maps are partitioned into coarse mapping units. Here, we indeed modeled the whole Italian territory although the resolution of the mapping unit we opted for is kept quite high. This returns a product with high resolution as well as a full coverage of the Italian landscape. Therefore, we envision it use in a consistent manner irrespective of the given administration.\nIt is important to note that the fine resolution of the SU, also implied a large computational burden. Below we provide a brief overview of the machine characteristics where we have run our modeling protocol as well as an indication of the associated computational times. Specifically, we have run our analyses on two machines, both equipped with 64 cores and 300\u00a0GB of RAM. The calibration phases approximately required one hour for each landslide type, while using a multi-threading routine spread over ten threads. As for the 10-fold cross validations, the computational time reached roughly ten hours for each landslide type. Finally, the 1000 simulations and the calculations of mean and 95% CI width, required approximately one day for each landslide type.\nThe mean and 95% CI of our 1000 simulations is available in an open repository accessible at this link. This is meant to ensure full transparency and to share the information in a GIS format that can be used not only for national scale assessments but that can be easily queried also at the regional level and potentially even at the catchment scale.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe strategy proposed here is currently the most comprehensive example of landslide susceptibility analysis, in a situation where incomplete landslide inventories may affect the model estimates over multiple landslide types. It consists in a continuation of the research started with Steger et al. (2016a) and continued until (Steger et al., 2021). It resulted in the first bias-free landslide susceptibility model for the whole Italian territory and for each landslide type reported in the IFFI inventory. Overall, we consider the eight susceptibility maps to be a complete tool for experts in the administrations to improve landscape management practices but also simply to make better decisions on which solution can become operational to reduce landslide risk, with an approach that can be tailored to the probabilistic expectation of a specific landslide type to occur at a given location.\nAside from these aspects, a number of extensions of the framework we propose can already be envisioned. First of all, we tested the effect of biased landslide inventories onto the susceptibility because the latter is the most common result sought through data-driven models. However, a more informative data-driven framework can lead to estimate the landslide intensity instead (here interpreted as number or size of landslides per mapping unit). In the context of landslide intensity no study is available so far to elucidate on what implications the use of biased inventories may lead to. Thus, we consider a worthy venue for future scientific studies to elaborate on what partial landslide information can induce in the estimation of landslide counts or sizes.\nThese susceptibility and intensity models separately constitute two fundamental elements of the hazard definition. Thus, an important extension to the framework we propose here also includes the assessment of what biased inventories can induce over the hazard definition. Along the same direction, even the temporal aspect of the hazard notion can exhibit strong biases. For instance, landslides area obviously being mapped better and more frequently now as compared to the past, because the resolution of the satellite scenes is higher and their acquisition frequency has also increased. However, no study so far has explored what a temporally biased model can induce over dynamic susceptibility models or just rainfall threshold estimates in early warning systems.\nOverall, data quality and inequality is still an issue in data-driven models applied to the landslide context. We believe this to be a problem that will decrease with time, as automated landslide mapping procedures are becoming increasingly common and more importantly reliable. Until these automated tools will become the standard though, analogous problems to the one we faced in this article will still affect most of the landslide predictive models. This will be especially valid for models built on the basis of a collection of different inventories, from different sources, for different purposes and with different thematic supports. In all these cases, we suggest a similar solution to the one presented here, in the hope of removing negative effects from the model outcomes.\nBefore concluding, we stress again that to promote reproducible results and to allow any reader to access the susceptibility patterns we produced in their raw form, we are sharing the eight mean susceptibility maps and their uncertainty at this link: https:\/\/geomorphology.irpi.cnr.it\/tools\/slope-units.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nThe authors declare that their research, data, manuscript and personal interpretations did not suffer from conflict of interests of any sort.\nLuigi Lombardo on behalf of all co-authors.\n\n","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe global distribution of evaporites reflects precipitation-evaporation patterns in arid climates, typically at latitudes 15\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 away from the equator (Gordon, 1975; Evans, 2006). The largest known evaporite deposits accumulated in restricted basins that experienced prolonged periods of quasi-stable climatic conditions along divergent margins (e.g., the South Atlantic Aptian, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, Hormuz, and Amadeus basins; Jackson and Hudec, 2017). Massive salt bodies experience extensive deformation during rifting, sediment loading, and isostatic adjustment. These concurrent coupled processes challenge the time-reversed backtracking to paleoenvironments (Warren, 2006). In addition, high impedance contrast between sediment and evaporite layers hampers seismic imaging both within and below evaporites (Jones and Davison, 2014); therefore, salt bodies are often poorly characterized.\nThe dissolution of submerged salt produces dense brines (McManus and Hanor, 1988; Esch, 1995) that fill seafloor depressions, such as in the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea (Swallow and Creease, 1965; Shokes et al., 1977; Jongsma et al., 1983; Ranganathan, 1991; Rodriguez et al., 2017). However, these hypersaline pools are a negligible fraction of the brine-forming potential of the submerged salt bodies. Instead, massive evaporites remain along continental margins, albeit with some evidence of dissolution at the upper boundary (Bertoni and Cartwright, 2005; Rodriguez et al., 2017).\nThe relatively young Red Sea basin presents a unique opportunity to understand massive evaporite formation, salt creep and related processes during the evolution of rift tectonics. This study pieces together the available evidence about late rift evolution and evaporite formation, analyzes creep, and advances a plausible explanation for the low dissolution rates observed in the Red Sea; results are relevant to other salt basins worldwide.\n\n\n2\nRed Sea evaporite formation\n\n2.1\nRift basin evolution and evaporite deposition\nBackstripping well data gathered in the Gulf of Suez places the onset of tectonic subsidence at ~25\u00a0Ma (Richardson and Arthur, 1988). Thereafter, three stages of evaporite formation occurred in the Red Sea due to periodic yet limited recharge from the north (in early times) and the south (modern times), and a high regional evaporation rate (Richardson and Arthur, 1988; Mitchell et al., 1992; Bosworth, 2015). The oldest rift evaporites are ~23\u00a0Ma old (Hughes and Johnson, 2005), and show sporadically in rift margin outcrops and well data. Therefore, we can infer intermittent linking to the Neo-Tethys Ocean, the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea.\nSeafloor spreading initiated between 15\u00a0Ma to 7\u00a0Ma (Izzeldin, 1987; Coleman, 1993; Dyment et al., 2013). In the meantime, the Arabian plate collided with the Eurasian plate ~13\u00a0Ma, and plate separation shifted from normal to oblique in the northern Red Sea. Today, the Euler pole between the Arabian and Nubian plates centers at 31.7\u00b0N, 24.6\u00b0E (ArRajehi et al., 2010).\nThe basin was connected to the Neo-Tethys Ocean until seawater influx became restricted, as evidenced by a large unconformity ~15\u00a0Ma (Hughes et al., 1992; Orszag-Sperber et al., 1998). Halite, then anhydrite formed post-rift in the middle to late Miocene (15\u00a0Ma to 5\u00a0Ma) and blanketed much of the Red Sea (Orszag-Sperber et al., 1998; Hughes et al., 1992). Deposition ceased by the time of the Messinian Unconformity at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (Afifi et al., 2014). During the early Pliocene (~5\u00a0Ma), the Indian Ocean flooded the Red Sea through the Bab al-Mandab's strait (Fleisher, 1974) and evaporate formation ended. The connection to the Indian Ocean remains open and marginal evaporites collect only in restricted lagoons along the Red Sea coast (Fig. 1\n; El-Anbaawy et al., 1992).\nThe Red Sea widens at spreading half-rates that range from ~8.5\u00a0mm\/yr in the south to <5\u00a0mm\/yr in the north (Chu and Gordon, 1998; ArRajehi et al., 2010). Seafloor spreading, basement subsidence, and overburden loading have caused creep and extensive distortion of the evaporites over the younger oceanic basaltic crust since the earliest halite deposition (Guennoc et al., 1988; Heaton et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 2021). Thick salt glaciers creep towards the central rift axis, and the front defines an escarpment several hundred meters high (Feldens and Mitchell, 2015). Salt flows coalesce in the northern Red Sea (~23\u00b0N) except for windows of isolated deeps or protruding seamounts. Further south, symmetric salt fronts bound the central trough.\n\n\n2.2\nEvaporite layers \u2013 salient characteristics\nThe thickness of evaporite layers is highly variable due to salt tectonics. Recent well logs show that the maximum evaporite thickness exceeds 3\u00a0km onshore in Yemen, >2.5\u00a0km in the Gulf of Suez, and at least 1\u00a0km in well logs along the Saudi Arabian coast (Fig. 2a; El-Anbaawy et al., 1992; Orszag-Sperber et al., 1998; Hughes and Johnson, 2005). Salt precipitates reflect the parent brine's composition (B\u0105bel and Schreiber, 2014). The precipitation of dissolved species from an evaporating brine is not concurrent: carbonates precipitate first, then sulfates, halite, and bittern salts last (McCaffrey et al., 1987; B\u0105bel and Schreiber, 2014).\nLaminated Red Sea evaporites vary from alternating halite beds <10\u00a0cm thick with interbedded 1\u00a0cm thin anhydrite layers to near-homogeneous halite sections thicker than 100\u00a0m (Stoffers and Kuhn, 1974; Hughes and Johnson, 2005). Regionally, the halite is overlain by massive and nodular anhydrite that transitions into laminated anhydrite near the upper contact. Interspersed bittern salts suggest periodic supersaturated conditions (Stoffers and Kuhn, 1974; Orszag-Sperber et al., 1998). Salt tectonics extensively distorts the halite and overlying deposits.\nHalite dominates the Miocene evaporites. The composition of massive halite samples regularly exceeds 98% pure soluble fractions; impurities reflect concurrent regional sedimentation processes (e.g., aeolian particles and biogenic grains). Interbedded shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone indicate temporary dilution, clastic wash-in and regional volcanic activity (Hassan and El-Dashlouty, 1970; Stoffers and Kuhn, 1974; Crossley et al., 1992). Shales are finely laminated and contain high silica content (>80%) and nanofossils (Stoffers and Kuhn, 1974). The highly brecciated siliciclastics record extensive deformation during salt creep and dissolution. Wavy, laminated anhydrite indicates halite dissolution (Hovorka, 2000). The overburden sediment layer has a highly variable thickness that varies from tens of meters to >7\u00a0km (Orszag-Sperber et al., 1998; Rowan, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2017).\n\n\n2.3\nAccommodation space\nThe central trough expands from full closure at ~23\u00b0N to a width of 50\u00a0km around 18\u00b0N. (Fig. 2). Based on recent mean spreading rates, the exposed basalts correspond to >7\u00a0m.y. of seafloor spreading. Seismic profiles, aerometric surveys and gravity measurements suggest the presence of oceanic crust below ~2\/3 of the Red Sea (Izzeldin, 1987; Tapponier et al., 2013; Augustin et al., 2016, 2021). If pervasive oceanic crust underlies the evaporites, then seafloor spreading must be ongoing for at least 15\u00a0m.y., and the oldest oceanic crust must have formed concurrently with salt deposition and creep.\nAssuming that basalts extend along the central axis to 50\u00a0km from the coast, salt covers up to 100\u00a0km of ridge-parallel basalts in the southern to the central Red Sea from 18\u00b0N to 23\u00b0N. Hence, the salt flow ranges from 20\u00a0km over the last 5\u00a0Ma to about 60\u00a0km over the last 10\u00a0Ma to reach its present edge in the southern Red Sea. These extreme assumptions result in salt creep rates between 4 and 6\u00a0mm\/yr.\nBased on seismic reconstruction, the original evaporite maximum thickness in the southern Red Sea was ~2\u00a0km (Heaton et al., 1995). Basement subsidence must match or exceed the salt deposition rate (Pindell and Heyn, 2022). Therefore, an average subsidence rate between 0.15 and 0.3\u00a0mm\/yr is required to accommodate the ~2\u00a0km salt deposition between 10-to-5\u00a0Ma (see also Evans, 1988). Clearly, preexisting basin depressions and eustatic variations in sea level could have contributed to additional accommodation space; in particular, a depression was needed if halite deposited over a shorter timescale (e.g., Afifi, 2020). At the end of evaporite deposition before the Indian Ocean flooded the Red Sea, the salt thickness must have exceeded ~1.5 times the current thickness to preserve mass (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\n2.4\nWater budget\nThe thickness of a salt bed H\n\ns\n [m] produced by the evaporation of a saline water column H\n\nw\n [m] is a function of the water salinity C [g NaCl\/kg saltwater]; from salt conservation\n\n(1)\n\n\nH\nw\n\n=\n\n1\nC\n\n\n\n\u03c1\ns\n\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n\n\nin terms of the flooding solution density \u03c1\n\nw\n [g\/cm3] and the salt density \u03c1\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a02.17 g\/cm3. For example, a H\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a01 km thick salt layer requires the evaporation of a H\n\nw\n= 7.0\u00a0km thick saturated brine pool with a salinity C\u00a0=\u00a0260\u00a0g NaCl\/kg solution (\u03c1\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a01.2 g\/cm3), or a H\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a053 km column of seawater with C\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0g NaCl\/kg solution (\u03c1\n\nw\n\u00a0=\u00a01.04 g\/cm3).\nConsequently, periodic seawater recharge and drying of the Red Sea basin must have occurred to produce the halite-anhydrite laminates of the late Miocene. For example, a anhydrite\/halite couplet H\n\ns\n = 10\u00a0cm requires the evaporation of seawater H\n\nw\n = 5.4\u00a0m across the basin, which would require almost four consecutive years at the current evaporation rate of 1.5\u00a0m\/yr. Hence, laminae thicker than ~3\u00a0cm point to longer climatic cycles rather than annual drying. On the other hand, the evaporation of a H\n\nw\n = 53\u00a0km seawater column needed to produce a H\n\ns\n= 1\u00a0km salt layer would require ~35 kyr, which is much shorter than the formation time (see also Al-Subhi, 2012 - Note: this observation remains valid even when we consider decreasing evaporation rates with increasing salt concentration - Data in Moore and Runkles, 1968; Mor et al., 2018).\nClearly, evaporite deposition was not limited by the evaporation rate but rather by the rate of basin recharge. Given the present salt distribution across the Red Sea, an average salt layer thickness H\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a01 km across the 4.4\u22c5105\u00a0km2 area would have required the evaporation of 2.3\u00b7107\u00a0km3 of seawater. Thus, seawater must have entered the basin at an average rate of 4.6\u00a0km3\/yr over 5\u00a0Ma, or 2.3\u00a0km3\/yr over 10\u00a0Ma. This flow rate is much smaller than the >1000\u00a0km3\/yr of seawater currently exchanged through the Bab-el-Mandeb's strait (Sofianos et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2019).\nThe restricted Lake Assal in nearby Djibouti is a modern analog for salt precipitation in a similar regional setting. The hypersaline lake maintains a stable ~0.5\u00a0km3 volume of saturated brine which is fed by seawater percolating through fractured basalt (Sanjuan et al., 1990). The arid conditions favor evaporation, and salt precipitates at a rate of ~1\u00a0cm\/yr (Imbert and Philippe, 2005).\n\n\n\n3\nSalt flows: creep velocity and gliding carbonate platforms\nOnshore and offshore salt bodies experience viscous flow (Fig. 4\n; see also Talbot and Pohjola, 2009; Mitchell et al., 2010). Viscosity depends on the evaporites composition and structure, and can exhibit marked differences. Halite deformation involves intragranular dislocation creep and grain boundary pressure-solution (Urai and Spiers, 2017). Anhydrite is denser and stiffer than other evaporites; its dynamic viscosity can vary in ten orders of magnitude (Bell, 1994; Zulauf et al., 2009; Giambastiani, 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). At strain rates typically imposed in laboratory tests, 10\u22128 s-1 to 10\u22126 s-1, evaporites often exhibit friction angles below 30\u00b0 (Bell, 1994; Liang et al., 2006; Giambastiani, 2014); yet the friction angle in pure halite can be ~50\u00b0 (Hansen et al., 1984; Frydman et al., 2008) and heterogeneity may contribute to even higher shear strength in excess of 60\u00b0 (Hansen et al., 1984). Given the scale of salt creep across the Red Sea, we seek large-scale material parameters relevant to the low strain-rate creep observed in the field which is in the order of <10\u221215 s-1.\n\n3.1\nBingham-Newtonian infinite glaciers\nSubmarine salt glaciers exhibit clear flow patterns on bathymetric images. Consider an infinite salt glacier of thickness H\n\ns\n [m] undergoing steady-state creep (Fig. 5a). A slice of thickness \u2202l experiences a driving force F\n\nd\n [N] caused by the weight W of the salt slice resting on a basal slope at an angle \u03b1,\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\nd\n\n\nz\n\n=\nW\n\nz\n\nsin\n\u03b1\n=\n\n\u03c1\ns\n\ng\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n\u2212\nz\n\n\nsin\n\u03b1\n\u00b7\n\u2202\nl\n\n\n\n\nThe evaporites low yield strength becomes negligible for salt thickness H\n\ns\n\u00a0>\u00a010 m and long timescales (Bell, 2005; Warren, 2006); then, thick salt glaciers behave as Newtonian rather than a Bingham fluid. The resistant force F\n\nr\n for a Newtonian fluid \n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\u03bc\n with viscosity \u03bc [Pa\u00b7s] is a function of the shear strain rate \n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n [s\u22121]\n\n(3)\n\n\nF\nr\n\n\nz\n\n=\n\u03c4\n\n\u2202\nl\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2202\nl\n=\n\n\n\u2202\nu\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2202\nl\n\n\n\n\nAt equilibrium, F\n\nd\n(z)\u00a0=\u00a0F\n\nr\n(z) and integration of the strain rate \n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n from the base z\u00a0=\u00a00 to the top of the salt layer z\u00a0=\u00a0H\n\ns\n yields the velocity profile with depth\n\n(4)\n\nu\n\nz\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c1\ns\n\ng\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\nz\n\u2212\n\n\nz\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\nsin\n\u221d\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting velocity profile predicted by Eq. (4) resembles steady laminar Newtonian fluid flow (Fig. 5a; see also Bogn\u00e1r et al., 2012), and the velocity at the top of the salt glacier z\u00a0=\u00a0H\n\ns\n is equal to\n\n(5)\n\nu\n\n\nH\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c1\ns\n\ng\n\n\n2\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n2\n\nsin\n\u221d\n\n\n\n\nThis implies an almost linear relationship with slope angle \u03b1 at low inclinations and a quadratic relationship with height \n\n\nH\ns\n\n2\n\n. The predicted thickness and tilt-dependent velocity is numerically verified for finite slopes with various L\/H\n\ns\n ratios (Fig. 5b).\nMost importantly, Eq. (5) predicts that the creep velocity is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity \u03bc. What is the effective large-scale dynamic viscosity \u03bc for salt glaciers in the Red Sea under geologic time scales? Seafloor spreading rates, the rotation pole and the presence of a salt suture zone in the central Red Sea north of 23.5\u00b0N provide a unique field experiment to estimate the effective viscosity \u03bc. Consider a current basal slope \u03b1\u00a0\u2248\u00a07\u00b0 (from seismic data, Heaton et al., 1995; Tubbs et al., 2014), a H\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a01000 m thick salt body with mass density \u03c1\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a02.17 g\/cm3, and a separation rate of u(rift)\u00a0\u2248\u00a06.5 mm\/yr at the suture point. Then, Eq. (5) suggests a large-scale effective dynamic viscosity \u03bc~1018 Pa\u00b7s for Red Sea evaporites. Remarkably, gravity-driven deformation of eastern Mediterranean evaporites also suggests a viscosity of 2.3\u00a0\u00b7\u00a01018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s (Cartwright et al., 2018).\nThe relationship between flow velocity and salt thickness is consistent with other Red Sea observations. The H\n\ns\n > 800\u00a0m thick salt glaciers in the central Red Sea can creep tens of millimeters per year as confirmed by the suture zone, while the thinned glaciers H\n\ns\n < 500\u00a0m along the southern Red Sea flow a few millimeters per year and cannot keep up with seafloor spreading. Thus, the exposed oceanic crust expands with time.\nLaboratory tests suggest the strain rate is not necessarily linear (\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\u221d\n\u03c4\n, i.e., Newtonian) but a power function of the shear stress \u03c4 (\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\u221d\n\n\u03c4\n\u03b2\n\n - Norton, 1929). We used Comsol Multiphysics to model a finite elasto-viscoplastic salt mass resting on a basal plane at slope angle \u03b1 and under isothermal conditions (COMSOL, 2021). Results show that the front velocity is a power function of the salt thickness \nu\n\u221d\n\n\nH\ns\n\n\n\u03b2\n+\n1\n\n\n; consequently, numerical results confirm that \nu\n\u221d\n\n\nH\ns\n\n2\n\n for a Newtonian viscous mass, i.e. \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01, in agreement with Eq. (5).\n\n\n3.2\nGliding sediment and carbonate platforms\nSedimentation in coastal environments provides another component of nearshore salt withdrawal. Sequential alluvial fans south of Jeddah are clear evidence of recent sediment depositions (Note: fans exceed 15\u00a0km in radius and are readily visible on Google Earth images; Fig. 6a). The syn-rift normal faults do not cut the base of the salt and elongated carbonate platforms parallel to the coast confirm extensional gliding above the salt (Fig. 6b; see Afifi et al., 2018).\nLet's consider an instantaneous sedimentary load p [kPa] that extends for a distance L [m] over a H\n\ns\n [m] thick salt layer of viscosity \u03bc [Pa\u00b7s] (Fig. 7a). The sediment layer settles at a rate \n\ns\n\u0307\n\n\nx\n\n [mm\/yr]; thus the salt flow rate q(x) towards the free edge is \ndq\n\/\ndx\n=\n\n\ns\n(\n\n\u0307\n\nx\n)\n. Assuming a constant shear strain rate \n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n [yr\u22121] with depth for any vertical section at distance x, the maximum flow velocity at the top is \n\nu\nm\n\n\nx\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n and the flux is q(x)\u00a0=\u00a0u\n\nm\n(x) H\n\ns\n\/2. Finally, the work done by the settling sedimentary load equals the work done in shear by the salt layer (Note: this assumes that the change in the potential energy in the salt layer beneath the load is compensated by the gain in potential energy beyond the loaded area). From this energy analysis, we can anticipate:\n\n(6)\n\nMaximum settlement rate\n\nat\n\nx\n=\nL\n\n\ns\n\u0307\n\n\nL\n\n\u2248\n\n\np\n\n\nH\ns\n3\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nb\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\nUniform settlement rate\n\n\ns\n\u0307\n\n=\n\n3\n4\n\n\n\np\n\n\nH\ns\n3\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\nStrain rate\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\n\n=\n\n3\n2\n\n\np\n\u03bc\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n(9)\n\nLateral flow velocity\n\n\nu\nm\n\n\nx\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\u0307\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nH\ns\n\n=\n\n3\n2\n\n\np\n\u03bc\n\n\n\nH\ns\n2\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nThese simple expressions obtained by assuming a uniform settlement rate highlight the interplay between the governing parameters p, H\n\ns\n\n, \u03bc and L. However, settlement is not uniform along the length L and numerical simulations show that settlement increases exponentially away from x\u00a0=\u00a00 at the fixed-end: \nlog\n\n\n\ns\n\u0307\n\n\nx\n\n\/\n\n\nmm\n\/\nyr\n\n\n\n\n\n=\na\n+\nbx\n (Fig. 7b).\nThe lateral flow velocity increases with distance x from the fixed boundary onshore (x\u00a0=\u00a00) towards the free boundary offshore (Eq. (9); Fig. 7b). Consequently, the overburden undergoes extension and may split into rafted islands. From Eq. (9), two points separated at a distance \u03bb move away from each other with relative velocity\n\n(10)\n\nRelative velocity\n\n\nu\nrel\n\n=\n\n3\n2\n\n\np\n\u03bc\n\n\n\nH\ns\n2\n\n\nL\n2\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a salt column of thickness H\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0m with large-scale viscosity \u03bc =\u00a01018\u00a0Pa\u00b7s (estimated above using the suturing limit), and a sediment load p\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0kPa that extends L\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0km over the salt layer: the computed mean settlement rate is \n\ns\n\u0307\n\n= 0.018\u00a0mm\/yr (Eq. (7)), and two points separated by \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0km will move apart with relative velocity u\n\nrel\n\u00a0=\u00a00.14\u00a0mm\/yr. While boundary conditions change after splitting, the analysis help us to anticipate the evolving separation between rafted islands.\nCoral reefs impose narrower and higher loads, thus local settlement rates can exceed several mm\/yr; for example, the reef settlement rate will be \n\ns\n\u0307\n\n= 12\u00a0mm\/yr for L\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0m and p\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0kPa and the same salt column thickness H\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0m. Typical growth rates for carbonate reefs in the Red Sea range from 2 to 15\u00a0mm\/yr (Heiss, 1994; Dullo et al., 1996; Cantin et al., 2010). Therefore, settlement can overtake coral reef production.\n\n\n\n4\nDissolution and self-preservation\nBrines from dissolving evaporites flow downhill or diffuse into the Red Sea. Exuding brine settles in topographic deeps along the axial trough and at nearshore depressions (Fig. 8a; Batang et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2015; Duarte et al., 2020). Brine pools exhibit either diffusive or sharp interfaces with the overlying Red Sea waters. Our analyses of various cases observed in the Red Sea show that sharp interfaces result from double-diffusive convection (a consequence of competing chemical and thermal effects on density), advection-driven skimming of the seawater-brine interfaces by bottom water currents, or spill overflow at topographic shoulders (See examples in Walin, 1964; Rosenblum et al., 2011; Kirkpatrick et al., 2012; Williamson et al., 2018).\nThe dissolved salt mass in brine pools is relatively small. In fact, the mass of evaporites underneath the Red Sea can fill the entire Red Sea basin with saturated brine more than ten times. Yet, the average Red Sea salinity C\u00a0\u2248\u00a040 [g NaCl\/kg saltwater] is much lower than saturation C\n\ns\n\u2248 260 [g NaCl\/kg saltwater].\nAway from the deeps, the pore fluid salinity in sediments above the evaporites exhibits non-constant concentration profiles indicating salt transport into Red Sea waters (Fig. 8c). This indicates that the dissolution of salt bodies is diffusion-limited across the insoluble sediments that rest above the salt. But, how did these sediments form? We hypothesize that sediments above salt bodies consist of two layers: (1) a residual sediment layer made of insoluble minerals that were present in the original evaporites and remain after the salt dissolves, (2) and an overlying layer of new sediments that are either wind transported or result from bio-mediated precipitation in the water column. Let's first explore the formation of the lower self-armoring layer by selective dissolution.\n\n4.1\nSelf-armoring by selective dissolution - experimental demonstration\nWe conducted a laboratory study and developed the analytical formulation to analyze self-armoring by selective dissolution. The test involves a mixture of silica sand and granular salt of similar grain size distribution (d\u00a0=\u00a0250-to-420\u00a0\u03bcm; initial salt volume fraction \u03c5 = V\n\ns\n\n\/V\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a00.5, initial mixture porosity n\n0 = 0.2). The granular bed is prepared in fully saturated brine to avoid initial dissolution (transparent chamber: 380\u00a0mm high, 250 wide, and 15\u00a0mm thick - Fig. 9a\n).\nFreshwater circulates above the sediment column (rate 0.3\u00a0mL\/s; concentration difference \u0394c\u00a0=\u00a0260\u00a0g NaCl\/kg solution). Salt then gradually dissolves and diffuses into the overlying water column leaving behind a residual cap of insoluble silica sand that gradually slows down further dissolution (estimated residual sand porosity n\u00a0=\u00a00.4). Self-armoring is readily confirmed (Fig. 9b): the first cm dissolves in 20\u00a0h, yet the second cm dissolves in 50\u00a0h, and 10\u00a0cm of dissolution requires >1000\u00a0h (Fig. 10\n). We measured the pore fluid salinity profile within the sediment using an electrical needle probe (Cho et al., 2004). The profile after 10,000\u00a0h resembles that observed in natural systems, albeit on considerably smaller length and time scales.\n\n\n4.2\nSelf-armoring by selective dissolution - analysis\nMathematically, self-armoring corresponds to diffusion with a moving boundary, i.e., a Stefan problem. As the thickness z of the overlying insoluble sediment layer increases, the salinity gradient \u0394c\/z decreases across the residual sediment (Lagrangian with respect to the sediment surface). Salt mass transfer follows Fick's law\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nV\ns\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\nD\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\u0394\nc\n\nz\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nThe effective diffusivity D\u2032 in the residual sediment is estimated from the bulk diffusivity in water D and the residual sediment porosity D\u2032\u00a0=\u00a0D\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0n [m2\/s]. The residual layer volume A\u00b7\u2202z relates to the dissolved salt volume \u2202V\n\ns\n, through the evaporite initial porosity n\n\no\n and salt volume fraction \u03c5 = V\n\ns\n\n\/V\n\nt\n, and the residual sediment porosity n:\n\n(12)\n\n\u2202\n\nV\ns\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c5\n\n\n\u2212\n\nn\no\n\n\n\n\n\u03c5\n\nA\n\n\u2202\nz\n=\n\n\u03c5\n\u03b3\n\n\nA\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\nwhere \u03b3\u00a0=\u00a0[(1-\u03c5)-n\n\no\n]\/(1-n) is the ratio between the residual sediment column final height to the evaporite initial thickness. For a diffusion-limited process, i.e., fast dissolution\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\n\u03c5\n\n\nD\n\nn\n\n\n\n\u0394\nc\n\nz\n\n\n\nwhere z\u00a0=\u00a00 at t\u00a0=\u00a00.

Furthermore, biostratigraphic dating of sediment cores suggests an average sedimentation rate of S\u00a0~\u00a00.1\u00a0mm\/yr during the last 5\u00a0Ma from biogenic and eolic sources (Stoffers and Ross, 1974). Background sedimentation adds to selective dissolution to increase the thickening rate of the overlying layer. For a constant sedimentation rate S, Eq. (13) becomes\n\n(15)\n\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\n\u03c5\n\n\nD\n\nn\n\n\n\n\u0394\nc\n\nz\n\n+\nS\n\n\n\n\nLet's apply the formulation and observations above to analyze the protective sediment layer on Red Sea evaporites. Consider the current concentration difference \u0394c\u00a0=\u00a00.22 kg NaCl\/kg H2O between salt saturation next to the evaporites and the water column, and a bulk diffusivity in water D\u00a0=\u00a04\u00b710\u22129\u00a0m2\/s; also, assume that the layered shale, anhydrite, and halite have an average salt volume fraction \u03c5 = 0.75 and initial porosity n\n\no\n\u00a0=\u00a00, and adopt an average sediment porosity n\u00a0=\u00a00.3 above the evaporites (Manheim et al., 1974). Then, the ratio between the final residual sediment column height to the evaporite initial thickness is \u03b3 =0.36. Therefore, a 200\u00a0m high residual sediment column would have required the dissolution of 560\u00a0m of evaporite and a 5\u00a0Ma time span (i.e., the end of massive evaporite formation and flooding).\nIf sedimentation occurs at a constant rate S\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u00a0mm\/yr, the protective sediment layer reaches a 610\u00a0m thickness in the 5\u00a0Ma: the lower 110\u00a0m results from residual dissolution and the upper 500\u00a0m from sedimentation (Fig. 11\n). The self-armoring residual layer prevails during the first 500 ky; background marine sedimentation plays a dominant role on dissolution rates over long time scales (Note: this analysis emphasized first order effects and disregarded others such as decreasing porosity during self-compaction and delayed dissolution in early high salinity waters).\nThe combined protective layer delays evaporite dissolution. Slow dissolution and active flux through the Bab-el-Mandeb's strait prevent the formation of a single regional brine pool.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions - main observations\nSeafloor spreading, basement subsidence, salt deposition and creep must have been quasi-concurrent processes in the Red Sea basin during the past 15\u00a0Ma. We pieced together published data and conducted first-order analyses to gain new insights into the formation of the Red Sea evaporites, and to assess ongoing creep and dissolution processes.\nCrustal thinning which led to the formation of the Red Sea started ~25\u00a0Ma. Only limited evaporites formed 23\u00a0Ma. Massive evaporite deposition started 15\u00a0Ma and continued until 5\u00a0Ma; the laminated stratigraphy hints to cyclic yet limited seawater recharge and multi-year drying periods of the Red Sea basin. Following the Messinian Unconformity, the Indian Ocean flooded the Red Sea through the Bab al-Mandab's strait at the start of the Pliocene (~5\u00a0Ma). Basement subsidence took place to accommodate deposition, with an inferred average subsidence rate of 0.15-to-0.3\u00a0mm\/yr.\nA 53\u00a0km high seawater column must have evaporated to leave behind the average 1\u00a0km thick salt bed. At today's evaporation rates, salt deposition was not evaporation-limited but controlled by the recharge rate. In fact, the needed average recharge was 2.3-to-4.6\u00a0km3\/yr, which is much smaller than the seawater currently exchanged through the Bab-el-Mandeb's strait.\nEvaporites creep over the younger oceanic basaltic crust towards the central rift axis, and the front defines an escarpment several hundred meters high. Salt flows coalesce in the northern Red Sea and form a suture north of ~23\u00b0N. In agreement with the spreading rate at the suture point, the average salt creep rate is 6.5\u00a0mm\/yr and the strain-rate is <10\u221215 s-1. A first-order analysis predicts a large-scale effective dynamic viscosity \u03bc ~ 1018 Pa\u00b7s for Red Sea halite.\nFluvial sedimentation in coastal environments drives salt withdrawal nearshore. Elongated carbonate platforms parallel to the coast confirm extensional gliding away from the coast on top of the evaporites. Simultaneous settlement can overtake coral reef production.\nThe dissolution of the massive salt bodies is diffusion-limited across the sediments that rest above the salt. These sediments consist of two strata: (1) the residual layer made of the insoluble grains that were present in the original evaporite and (2) the upper layer of wind transported or bio-mediated precipitates in the water column.\nThe mass of evaporites underneath the Red Sea could fill the entire Red Sea basin with saturated brine more than ten times. However, self-armoring and diffusion limited dissolution combines with active flux through the Bab-el-Mandeb's strait to prevent the formation of a one vast brine pool in the Red Sea.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nJ.E.S and J.C.S. contributed equally to the concept and analysis of the work and the writing of the manuscript.\n\n","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe timing of animal origins is a question that has attracted considerable attention ever since Darwin famously discussed this topic in The Origin (Darwin, 1859, Chapter IX). There remains, however, surprisingly little agreement on when the initial evolutionary radiation of animals occurred. Molecular clock based studies have repeatedly placed the origins of animals and of major bilaterian clades hundreds of millions of years before their appearance in the fossil record, implying an undetected animal radiation beginning during the Cryogenian (720\u2013635\u00a0Ma) or the Tonian (1000\u2013720\u00a0Ma) (Dos Reis et al., 2015; Cunningham et al., 2017; Dohrmann and W\u00f6rheide, 2017). In contrast, the oldest evidence for probable total-group animal remains among the fossil record are the approximately 575\u00a0Ma examples of Ediacara-biota from the Avalonian assemblage in Newfoundland (Matthews et al., 2020), and the oldest fossils assignable to crown-group bilaterian phyla are all Cambrian (Budd and Jensen, 2000, 2017; Kouchinsky et al., 2012). An often-invoked explanation for this discrepancy, is that problems of incompleteness and preservation failure are inherent to the fossil record, and worse, are of a sufficient magnitude that this record cannot distinguish the initial evolution of animals (Fortey et al., 1997; Balavoine and Adoutte, 1998; Sperling et al., 2010; Erwin et al., 2011; Dohrmann and W\u00f6rheide, 2017; Sperling and Stockey, 2018; Mills et al., 2018a, 2018b).\nThe major preservation issues besetting the fossil record are 1) taphonomic fidelity \u2013 whether or not the processes of fossilisation are able to capture information from the level of tissue types up to entire ecosystems \u2013 and 2) taphonomic continuity \u2013 problems of a discontinuous record. Moreover, among most styles of fossil preservation, these factors are often at odds.\nHigh fidelity modes of fossilisation, such as Burgess Shale-type (BST) Lagerst\u00e4tten, tend to be rare and have a restricted temporal and environmental distribution. Consequently, they are of limited value in reconstructing broader-scale macroevolutionary trends. In the case of Cambrian BST Lagerst\u00e4tten for instance, their temporal distribution appears to be non-random, with a clustering of sites in the late-early\/middle Cambrian, while other time windows (e.g. the Terreneuvian) are effectively devoid of such deposits (Butterfield, 1995; Budd and Jensen, 2003; Slater et al., 2018a).\nConversely, other types of fossilisation offer a comparatively continuous, time-dense record, but at the cost of a profoundly biased perspective on ancient ecosystems. The fossil remains of shells and other biomineralized hard-parts underpin most broad-scale reconstructions of macroevolutionary patterns through the Phanerozoic (e.g., Sepkoski, 1981; Alroy, 2010; Bush and Bambach, 2015). The capacity of this style of preservation to track the evolution of clades is dependent on their degree of biomineralization. In light of this, there are good reasons for approaching this record with caution \u2013 biomineralizers represent a tiny fraction of the total diversity, both in modern and ancient marine ecosystems, with most marine taxa producing no mineralized hard-parts (Conway Morris, 1986, 1998, 2000; Chen and Zhou, 1997; Butterfield, 2003; Shaw et al., 2020). Animal groups that are entirely soft-bodied or unmineralized are invisible to this record. On these grounds, the Cambrian appearance of bilaterian clades is frequently viewed as simply the \u2018switching on\u2019 of the fossil record, following the widespread and broadly synchronous evolution of mineralized hard-parts in multiple animal clades (e.g., Rhoads and Morse, 1971; Lowenstam and Margulis, 1980; Towe, 1981; Runnegar, 1982; Vermeij, 1989; Fortey et al., 1997, 2004; Lieberman, 2002; Fedonkin, 2003; Cohen, 2005; Wood, 2011; Murdock and Donoghue, 2011). In this view, the classical \u2018Cambrian Explosion\u2019 does not preclude prior cryptic radiations of non-biomineralized animals.\nTrace fossils show a continuous record beginning in the late Ediacaran (Jensen, 2003), crucially documenting the activities of both mineralized and soft-bodied animals (Buatois and M\u00e1ngano, 2018). Even so, the information available from trace fossils is confined to benthic (mostly bilaterian) behaviour, and in most cases the morphology or phylogenetic affinity of the producer organism is unknown. Furthermore, since the resolution of trace fossils is limited by the grainsize of the host sediments, the activities of any minute (e.g. meiofaunal) metazoans may be difficult to detect (but see Parry et al., 2017). Ideally, tracking the initial diversification of animals requires a mode of fossilisation with enough fidelity to preserve animals regardless of their degree of mineralization, but which also displays taphonomic continuity throughout the Neoproterozoic and early Phanerozoic.\nHere we draw attention to another source of fossil data \u2013 organic microfossils \u2013 which we argue have an overlooked capacity to constrain the timing of animal origins. Acid-extracted organic microfossils have a long history of study, and there has been a particular emphasis on exploiting these fossils as a tool for biostratigraphic correlation (e.g., McGregor, 2002; Traverse, 2007). Indeed, a substantial record of organic microfossils has been accumulated, stretching back billions of years (Yin, 1997; Javaux et al., 2010; Sugitani et al., 2015). Most of the pre-Ordovician record consists of acritarchs (Evitt, 1963; Downie et al., 1963), or the remains of bacterial filaments. Recently, it has become clear that this style of preservation can also capture microscopic organically-preserved fragments of animal remains, termed \u2018small carbonaceous fossils\u2019 or SCFs (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). These microfossils include remains sourced from both biomineralizing and wholly unmineralized metazoan clades (e.g., Butterfield, 1994; Harvey et al., 2012a; Slater et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2015b). Articulated macrofossils of this kind are exceedingly rare in marine sedimentary rocks, being restricted to BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten (Fig. 1\n). Though SCFs are typically fragmentary, the quality of microstructural preservation often exceeds that of the Burgess Shale (Harvey et al., 2012a). Moreover, the relaxed biostratinomic demands of smaller-sized particles mean that SCFs are readily preserved in a broad range of sedimentary environments (Bath Enright et al., 2021). A small 50\u00a0g chip of shale for instance, can contain thousands of such microfossils, making potential biases related to rock area, or even outcrop exposure largely irrelevant. Organic microfossils therefore represent another crucial line of evidence \u2013 independent of the shelly fossil, trace fossil, or Lagerst\u00e4tten records \u2013 that can yield insights into major macroevolutionary trends such as the origination of the animals (Fig. 2\n).\nIn this study we;\nCollate a database of all studies of acid-extracted organic microfossils from rocks of Tonian through to Cambrian Miaolingian (Middle Cambrian) Wuliuan age (the approximate age of the Burgess Shale), a span of around half a billion years of Earth history (Fig. 3\n). We scrutinize each of these studies for evidence of organically-preserved animals, and find that animal remains are a relatively common constituent of organic microfossil assemblages. We discuss and examine the limitations of this record in detail, uncovering potential impacts of sampling and other biases, and offer suggestions for how these may be remediated. Further, we review the SCFs record of metazoans and establish a chronology of first appearance of all animal clades with an Ediacaran or Cambrian SCF record. We compare this emerging record against the first appearance of these clades in other modes of fossilisation, and find that in multiple major animal clades, their earliest appearance in the current fossil record is as SCFs. In others, the first appearance as SCFs is approximately synchronous with that of other taphonomic modes (among shelly fossils or Lagerst\u00e4tten). Following this, we critically evaluate putative reports of Proterozoic animals among organic microfossils, and find that in all such cases prior to the late Ediacaran, these can be ascribed to non-metazoans.\nTaken together, the signal that emerges from organic microfossils broadly mirrors the patterns seen among other independent signals from the fossil record, with a late Ediacaran appearance of total-group bilaterians, followed by an early Cambrian emergence of recognisable total-group phyla. Significantly, this signal is embedded within a deeper record of organic microfossils. This \u2018record within a record\u2019 highlights the importance of this type of preservation in bypassing some of the problems inherent to other taphonomic windows which are liable to open or close at different points throughout Earth history.\n\n\n2\nMetazoans and the organic microfossil record\nFor most research targeting organic microfossils, the main focus of the study is a biostratigraphic and\/or systematic description of acritarchs. Even so, metazoan fragments are fortuitously captured in such studies. Despite this, there have been no attempts to survey recorded instances of metazoan-derived organic microfossils. The challenge is to consolidate these scattered reports which are currently spread across a disparate body of literature, with the aim of bringing to light this hidden chronicle of animal evolution, and establishing a useful foundation for future expansion of this record.\nIn total, we critically examined and data-mined 394 original publications for information regarding acid-extracted organic microfossils (Supplementary Database). Information was compiled regarding individual rock formations that have been productively sampled for organic microfossils, including the geographic locality and age of the formation, and the number of studies that have focussed (either wholly or in part) on the organic microfossil contents of the formation. Organic microfossil assemblages reported in these studies were subsequently scrutinised for evidence of metazoan remains, and where found these instances were tabulated.\nExcluded from our dataset of 394 publications are review papers with no new data, and studies focussed exclusively on ecological or biological discussions of organic microfossils (e.g., reproductive biology or use as depth indicators) unless new material or novel taxonomic information was included. Studies of organic microfossils preserved in cherts and known only via thin sections were also omitted, unless the fossils had been successfully acid-extracted.\nThe dataset has a global coverage (Fig. 4\n) and encompasses 399 individual formations that have been successfully sampled for organic microfossils, ranging from the beginning of the Neoproterozoic through to Cambrian Wuliuan age. In total, the database includes 58 formations from the Tonian, 49 formations from the Cryogenian, 122.2 from the Ediacaran (57.3 from the early Ediacaran [pre-Gaskiers glaciation], 64.8 from the late Ediacaran [post-Gaskiers glaciation]), and 169.8 from the Cambrian Fortunian\u2013Wuliuan. Within the Cambrian, the database encompasses 32.8 formations from the Fortunian, 21.8 from Cambrian Stage 2, 31.8 from Cambrian Stage 3, 34.8 from Cambrian Stage 4, and 48.8 from Cambrian Wuliuan Stage (Stage 5). Note that in a few cases a formation crosses two or more periods\/stages (e.g., Fortunian\u2013Stage 2), in which case the value is divided between the number of periods\/stages (e.g., for a formation that spans Fortunian\u2013Stage 2, a value of 0.5 is assigned to each time window). Where necessary\/possible, formations have been converted into the most recent or formally established stratigraphic nomenclature by searching recent literature and via consultation of online stratigraphic lexicons (available for Britain [http:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/technologies\/the-bgs-lexicon-of-named-rock-units\/], Canada [http:\/\/weblex.canada.ca\/weblexnet4\/weblex_e.aspx] and the United States [http:\/\/ngmdb.usgs.gov\/Geolex\/search]).\nIn the interests of completeness, we opted for an inclusive approach whereby all formations that have produced acid-extracted microfossils were tabulated, and all studies were examined for metazoan remains. It should be noted, however, that there is substantial qualitative variation among organic microfossil studies, ranging from reports that are more-or-less pilot studies, describing the microfossil contents of a handful of samples, up to detailed monographs and biostratigraphic studies totalling thousands of microfossil samples. A first approximation of the intensity with which a particular unit has been sampled can be gathered from the number of published studies focussing on that stratigraphic unit (the number of studies per formation range from 1 to 17, with an average of 1.94). In this light, it is also worth noting that in many cases taphonomic quality actually tends to increase with age (Woltz et al., 2021), meaning that on average, Proterozoic organic microfossil assemblages with good quality fossil preservation may be even more likely to capture any contemporaneous animal diversity than their Cambrian counterparts.\nThe dataset allows for a broad-scale comparison of organic microfossil sampling throughout the Neoproterozoic and earliest part of the Phanerozoic (Fig. 5\n). In our database, a formation that has been productive for organic microfossils is classified as containing metazoan remains regardless of whether the evidence for such metazoans comprises a singleton, thousands of specimens, or a rich diversity of metazoan taxa. By focussing solely on the presence or absence of metazoan remains, the database circumvents some of the inevitable biases introduced by processing (see Discussion).\nIn total, we identified 399 formations of Tonian\u2013Cambrian Wuliuan age that are known to be productive for organic microfossils \u2013 of these, 57 were found to contain organic microfossils sourced from metazoans (Fig. 5). Metazoan remains were identified in 74 out of 394 studies ranging from the onset of the Neoproterozoic to the end of the Cambrian Wuliuan Stage. All organic microfossil assemblages reported from Tonian, Cryogenian, and early Ediacaran formations were devoid of metazoan-derived fossils.\nIn a few cases, studies included organic microfossils that are potentially sourced from metazoans, but could not be definitively identified as metazoan. In such instances (12 of the 399 total formations), we classified these separately as \u2018possible metazoans\u2019 (Fig. 5). Almost all these cases are of late Ediacaran age, and comprise problematic taxa such as Cochleatina and Saarina (see SCF groups section below).\nWithin the Cambrian, metazoans have been detected among organic microfossils in 51 of 169.83 surveyed formations. Later Cambrian stages (stages 4 and 5) contain proportionally slightly fewer reports of metazoan remains per formation when compared to those from the earliest Cambrian Terreneuvian. However, it is important to note that this does not reflect a decrease in metazoan diversity among SCFs \u2013 although metazoan remains are common among Terreneuvian organic microfossils, they are typically sourced from only a few taxa. Assemblages from post-Terreneuvian formations often encompass a much richer variety of metazoan remains (e.g., Harvey et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Slater et al., 2017, 2018b; Wallet et al., 2021). This pattern may also in part reflect the explosion of protistan diversity registered in the Tommotian\/Cambrian Stage 2 radiation of small (<50\u00a0\u03bcm) acanthomorphic acritarchs. These small acanthomorphs saturate marine records of organic microfossils following the Terreneuvian, and their fast evolution and rates of turnover make them ideally suited to biostratigraphy. Post-Terreneuvian formations have consequently been the target of numerous biostratigraphic studies employing preparation techniques optimised for the recovery of these smaller, robust cyst-like acritarchs, and where incidental recovery of metazoan fragments is of less interest to the primary aims of the study. In any case, it is clear that metazoans comprise a relatively common subset of organic microfossils in assemblages of a late Ediacaran age or younger (Fig. 5).\nFollowing on from this first assessment, all metazoan remains identified in the database were subsequently subjected to careful scrutiny to determine their more precise affinities where possible (see SCF groups section below). In the more recent literature the affinities have usually been documented in detail, but examples from older literature often lack a phylogenetic grounding and some were not recognised as the remains of animals when first discovered. The results of this further analysis were integrated into a global first appearance dataset for different metazoan groups and clades within the organic microfossil record (Fig. 6\n).\n\n\n3\nSCF groups\nLike small shelly fossils, the affinities of many isolated SCF sclerites and fragments remain unresolved beyond higher taxonomic groupings, with some being merely identifiable as \u2018metazoan\u2019 remains. A significant portion though, comprise phylogenetically informative fragments that can be utilized to date and trace the evolution of particular animal clades. Here we scrutinize and summarise instances of major animal clades detected among Ediacaran and Cambrian organic microfossils (supplemented with some original material), giving data on first appearances and how these compare to records (where present) from other modes of fossilisation. The results of this global appraisal of metazoans among organic microfossils are compiled in Fig. 6.\n\n3.1\nSponges (Porifera)\nSponge remains extracted as SCFs are known from the lower Cambrian Stage 4 (Bonnia\u2013Olenellus Biozone) of the Middle Shale Member of the Forteau Formation from Newfoundland, Canada (Harvey, 2010), from the lower Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 File Haidar Formation, Sweden (Fig. 2b), and the Miaolingian, Wuliuan Stage Borgholm Formation, Sweden (personal observation). Harvey (2010) interpreted these sponge-derived SCFs as the remains of the collagenous sheaths that encapsulate originally mineralized spicules (Harvey, 2010). Mineralized spicules are found in considerably older basal Cambrian strata (e.g., Chang et al., 2017; Reitner et al., 2022) and have an extensively developed Phanerozoic fossil record (Botting and Muir, 2018). Although only a handful of sponge SCFs have been reported to date, their preservation is significant, since it highlights the potential to detect any concealed history of non-mineralized spicules in the Proterozoic.\n\n\n3.2\nChaetognaths\nEarliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) SCF assemblages are often dominated by large numbers of simple curved carbonaceous spines (e.g., Pl. 1. of Bu\u0142a and Jachowicz, 1996; fig. S2 of Palacios et al., 2018; fig. 3 of Slater et al., 2018a; fig. 3 of Slater and Willman, 2019). The majority of these spines are described under the acritarch form taxon Ceratophyton vernicosum, or Ceratophyton sp. (e.g., Kiryanov in Volkova et al., 1979; fig. 2.7 of Korkutis, 1981; Pl. 22 of Ogurtsova, 1985; Jankauskas et al., 1989; Pl. 15. fig. E of Moczyd\u0142owska, 1991; fig. 4a, b, h of Wright et al., 1993; Gravestock et al., 2001; Pl. 3. of Vanguestaine and L\u00e9onard, 2005; fig. 4B, C of Palacios et al., 2011). A substantial portion of these carbonaceous spines nevertheless exhibit a fibrous microstructure identical to that of chaetognath grasping elements (Slater et al., 2018a). Chaetognaths are a protostome phylum of predatory marine worms, which appear closely related to the Gnathifera (Marl\u00e9taz et al., 2019). The vast majority of extant chaetognaths are minute zooplankton. Carbonaceous microfossils reminiscent of chaetognath grasping spines are also present in Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary strata (e.g., base of Chapel Island Formation, Fortune Head, Newfoundland; fig. 4f of Palacios et al., 2018) and even among latest Ediacaran organic microfossil assemblages (see Bilaterians section below). Alongside SCFs, the early emergence of the chaetognath clade is also picked up in the shelly fossil record, since some early chaetognaths appear to have had mineralized, or at least biophosphatic grasping elements (Szaniawski, 1982, 2002; Wierzbowski et al., 2021) \u2013 these phosphatic and calcitic spines known as \u2018protoconodonts\u2019 are widespread and abundant in Fortunian SSF assemblages (e.g., Protohertzina anabarica\nMissarzhevsky, 1973; Steiner et al., 2004; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). Carbonaceous protoconodonts are also found in younger Cambrian SCF assemblages (e.g., fig. 9 of Slater et al., 2017; fig. 3V of Slater et al., 2018b). Despite their abundance as microfossils, chaetognath macrofossils are almost entirely restricted to BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten (e.g., Briggs and Caron, 2017; Shu et al., 2017). The congruence seen in their disarticulated SSF and SCF records underlines the importance of these styles of preservation for tracking the broader evolutionary history of groups with otherwise poor fossilisation potential.\n\n\n3.3\nWiwaxia\nWiwaxiids comprise an extinct group of Cambrian marine invertebrates with a highly distinctive dorsal scleritome of organic scales (Smith, 2014). Once regarded to be a so-called \u2018weird wonder\u2019 that resisted classification among extant phyla (Brysse, 2008), the eponymous genus Wiwaxia has since been reconsidered as either a stem-mollusc, a stem-annelid, stem to Annelida + Mollusca, or a stem-lophotrochozoan (e.g., Smith et al., 2015a). As macrofossils wiwaxiids are found solely in Burgess Shale-type Lagerst\u00e4tten, but their distinctive sclerites have a much broader distribution as disarticulated microfossils. Two phosphatized sclerites have been reported from the Miaolingian Monastery Creek Formation of Australia (Southgate and Shergold, 1991; fig. 11.7\u201311 of Porter, 2004a), but the vast majority of sclerites have been recovered as acid-isolated organic microfossils (Slater et al., 2018a). The lophotrochozoan affinity of Wiwaxia is evident from the characteristic microstructure of these organic sclerites, which bear the hallmark of microvillar secretion via a basal chaetoblast (Butterfield, 1990). SCF sclerites and dorsal spines from wiwaxiids have been acid-isolated from siliciclastic strata of the Lancara Formation, northern Spain (Palacios et al., 2014); File Haidar Formation, \u00d6land, Sweden (Slater et al., 2018a; Fig. 2k); Mount Cap Formation, NWT, Canada (Butterfield, 1994; Harvey and Butterfield, 2011); Forteau Formation, Newfoundland, Canada (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012); Mahto Formation, Alberta (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012); Pika Formation, Alberta (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012); Earlie Formation, Saskatchewan (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012); Borgholm Formation, \u00d6stergotland, Sweden (Slater et al., 2017); Burgess Shale, British Columbia, Canada (Butterfield, 1990); Llanos Basin, Colombia (Smith et al., 2015a); Series 3\/Furongian Nolichucky Shale, Tennessee, USA (Pedder, 2012); Kaili Formation, Guizhou, China (Harvey et al., 2011); Wuliuan Stage Jince Formation, Czech Republic (Kov\u00e1\u0159, 2020). Indeed, the stratigraphic and palaeogeographic range of wiwaxiids has been considerably broadened by their recognition among organic microfossils. Acid-isolated sclerites have expanded their known distribution to palaeocontinents that lack BST Lagerst\u00e4tten (e.g., Baltica, South America), and have been extracted from deeper water (e.g. Burgess Shale) to shallow mud-cracked facies (e.g. Pika Formation), suggesting wiwaxiids were eurytopic organisms \u2013 tolerant of a wide range of palaeoenvironments (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). Subtle differences among sclerite morphology (presence or absence of pustules, spines, and overall shape) hint at specific-level diversity, suggesting that wiwaxiids may have formed a moderately diverse plesion. When the record from isolated sclerites is taken into account, it becomes clear that wiwaxiids were in fact a cosmopolitan element of the Cambrian fauna for some ~15\u00a0Ma (Fig. 6).\n\n\n3.4\nMolluscs\nSeveral molluscan clades (e.g., bivalves, gastropods, ammonites) account for some of the most complete fossil records among any animal group (Valentine et al., 2006). The vast majority of molluscan fossils comprise remains of a protective mineralized shell, and other tissues are only rarely preserved. This is the case for the characteristically molluscan feeding apparatus \u2013 the radula \u2013 which has a comparatively poor fossil record. Nevertheless, there are signs from the emerging SCFs record that radulae may be relatively common as organic microfossils. Indeed, the oldest known unambiguous fossil radulae are SCF remains from the Lower Cambrian (Stage 3\u20134) Mahto Formation, Alberta, Canada (Butterfield, 2008). Other SCF radulae are known from the upper part of the Early Cambrian Stage 4 Mount Cap Formation (Colville Hills), Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 2M of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012), the Miaolingian (Middle Cambrian) Bright Angel Shale of Arizona (fig. 2N of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012), and the Upper Cambrian Earlie (Binda et al., 1996; fig. 2S of Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b) and Deadwood (fig. 2T, U of Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b) formations from Saskatchewan, Canada. These organically preserved fossil radulae offer an important alternate insight into Cambrian molluscan evolution and feeding anatomy.\n\n\n3.5\nHyoliths\nHyoliths are an extinct group of Palaeozoic benthic animals that produced distinctive cone-shaped calcareous shells, which are particularly abundant as fossils in Cambrian strata. The affinities of hyoliths are unclear, though they are usually considered to represent either lophophorates (Moysiuk et al., 2017), or stem-lophotrochozoans (Liu et al., 2020). Acid-extracted remains of variously articulated and disarticulated hyolith conchs, opercula and helens have been reported from the Cambrian Stage 4\u20135 Mount Cap Formation, Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 4 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; Harvey and Butterfield, 2011; Mart\u00ed Mus, 2014), from the base of Cambrian Wuliuan Stage Kaili Formation, Guizhou Province, China (fig. 2B\u2013E of Harvey et al., 2011) and the Lower Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 Buen Formation of North Greenland (fig. 3AO of Slater et al., 2018b; fig. 14AB of Wallet et al., 2021). The underlying taphonomic sequence of how originally mineralized hyoliths can preserve as SCFs is discussed in detail in Mart\u00ed Mus (2014).\n\n\n3.6\nBrachiopods\nBrachiopods are among the most abundant macroscopic fossils, with an extensive geological history stretching back to the early Cambrian (Harper et al., 2017). As SCFs, brachiopods have been extracted from the early Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 Buen Formation of Greenland (figs. 12, 14 of Wallet et al., 2021), the early Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 File Haidar Formation of Sweden (personal observation), the Little Bear fossil biota from the Middle Cambrian (Stage 4\u20135) Mount Cap Formation in Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 3.3\u20133.4 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; fig. 4a of Harvey and Butterfield, 2011), the Miaolingian Wuliuan Stage Borgholm Formation of Sweden (Fig. 2j), and fragments from the Miaolingian Wuliuan Stage Kaili Formation in China (fig. 2F\u2013H of Harvey et al., 2011). The oldest known brachiopod remains date to Cambrian Stage 2 (c. 529\u2013521\u00a0Ma), broadly equivalent to the Tommotian of Siberia (Fig. 6; Pelman, 1977; Ushatinskaya, 2008; Topper et al., 2013). Although brachiopods are some of the oldest known recognisable biomineralizing benthic animals (Bassett et al., 1999), higher order brachiopod clades may have diverged prior to acquisition of a mineralizing habit, with certain stem-brachiopods and basal crown-brachiopods being unmineralized (Gorjansky and Popov, 1986; Holmer et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014). Since brachiopod material can demonstrably be captured in Cambrian organic microfossil assemblages, this should prompt the search for remains of potential non-mineralized stem-brachiopods among the emerging Fortunian SCFs record (e.g., Slater et al., 2018a).\n\n\n3.7\nAnnelids\nThe lophotrochozoan phylum Annelida has an excellent fossil record as organic microfossils in the form of scolecodonts, the fossilised jaws of eunicid and phyllodocid polychaete annelids (Eriksson et al., 2016). Prior to the Ordovician radiation of jawed polychaetes, the early fossil record of annelids is sporadic and largely confined to BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten. Early stem-annelids appear to have lacked jaws, nevertheless, other elements of annelid anatomy can feasibly preserve as organic microfossils. This was first demonstrated when semi-articulated arrays of chaetae from the Burgess Shale taxon Canadia spinosa were acid-extracted directly from macrofossils (fig. 2C\u2013D of Butterfield, 1990), indicating that dispersed chaetae might also survive acid treatment. As with the chaetae of wiwaxiids, isolated chaetae and clusters of chaetae sourced from annelids have since been recovered as SCFs from Cambrian strata. These include distinctive bifid-tipped brush chaetae (Baltichaeta jormunganda\nSlater et al., 2017; Fig. 2f) that are abundant and widespread as SCFs in early Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 strata in Sweden (fig. 8 of Slater et al., 2017), and importantly, a similar chaetae among organic microfossils from the Lappaj\u00e4rvi impact structure in Finland (fig. 4 of Slater and Willman, 2019). This latter occurrence, extracted from Terreneuvian mudrocks, is likely the oldest body fossil evidence for annelids (Fig. 6).\n\n\n3.8\nChancelloriids\nChancelloriids are an extinct group of sessile, bag-like Cambrian animals that were wholly or sometimes partially covered with a scleritome of star-shaped calcareous spines. Their sclerites are relatively common among Cambrian assemblages of small shelly fossils (e.g., Moore et al., 2014), and they occur as articulated bedding-plane macrofossils in Lagerst\u00e4tten such as the Burgess Shale (Bengtson and Collins, 2015). The star-shaped sclerites of Chancelloriids can also preserve as organic microfossils, and have been acid-isolated from mudstones of the Cambrian Stage 4\u20135 Mount Cap Formation, Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 5 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; Harvey and Butterfield, 2011), and from the Miaolingian (basal Wuliuan Stage) Kaili Formation in Guizhou Province, China (fig. 2B\u2013E of Harvey et al., 2011).\n\n\n3.9\nPriapulids\nAs macrofossils, early priapulids are essentially confined to BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten, though there are notable Cambrian occurrences of phosphatised embryo\/larval scalidophorans from \u2018Orsten-type\u2019 deposits; e.g., Markuelia (Dong et al., 2005), Eopriapulites (Shao et al., 2016), Eokinorhynchus (Zhang et al., 2015). Many Cambrian \u2018priapulids\u2019 may in fact represent more basal clades of scalidophoran, cycloneuralian (scalidophora plus nematoida) or even stem ecdysozoan worms with a morphology similar to priapulids (the term \u2018archaeopriapulids\u2019 is sometimes used to denote this Cambrian grade of priapulid-like worms; Conway Morris, 1977). The body of extant priapulids is enclosed within a sclerotized extracellular cuticle \u2013 like all ecdysozoans, this cuticle is shed via ecdysis throughout the lifespan of the worm, whereby it typically disintegrates into a multitude of tiny fragments (Sansom, 2016). By contrast with the patchy macrofossil record, fragments of priapulid-like cuticle are in fact relatively common as organic microfossils in Cambrian assemblages. Frequently these isolated fragments are recognisable as the minute spines that ornament the outer surface of priapulid cuticles, consisting of distinctive hook- or cone-shaped elements, usually bearing subsidiary denticles (Fig. 2g, m, n, p). Multiple sclerites connected to larger portions of cuticle are also occasionally recovered as organic microfossils (e.g., Harvey et al., 2012a; Kontorovich et al., 2012). In principle, some simple isolated organic cones could be produced by non-metazoans, such as ciliates (e.g. tintinnids), however genuine scalidophoran-derived spines can be identified by their basal portion of cuticle which grades into a characteristic polygonal micro-ornament (Fig. 2p). Other SCFs that could be confusable with the sclerites of priapulids include the acid-extracted respiratory organs of eurypterids (e.g., fig. 9B\u2013D of Filipiak et al., 2012), which are distinguishable by their mesh-like porous walls in contrast to solid-walled priapulid sclerites. Comparison with extant and fossil priapulids reveals that the hook-shaped sclerites (scalids; Fig. 2g, m, n) are usually from the trunk and the introvert of the worm, whereas triangular sclerites (teeth; Fig. 2p) are sourced from the pharynx (Smith et al., 2015b), but SCF examples likely also include various sensory spines, tail-hooks and cuticles derived from larval forms.\nThe characteristic morphology of priapulid sclerites has even enabled particular fossil priapulid species (Ottoia prolifica, O. tricuspida and Selkirkia) to be identified among organic microfossils and tracked across Cambrian sedimentary basins (Smith et al., 2015b). Comparable SCFs are found throughout the Cambrian; notable examples include priapulid-like sclerites from the Earlie and Deadwood formations (Miaolingian to Furongian), Saskatchewan, Canada (Pl. 1. figs. 15, 16 of Binda et al., 1996; fig. 2g of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012; figs. 9A\u2013M, 10A\u2013D of Smith et al., 2015b); the Pika Formation (Miaolingian, Guzhangian Stage), Alberta, Canada (figs. 9N\u2013U, 10E\u2013H, 11 of Smith et al., 2015b); the Hess River Formation (Miaolingian Series), Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 2e of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012); the Borgholm Formation (Wuliuan Stage), Sweden (personal observation); the Kaili Formation (Wuliuan Stage), China (fig. 5 of Harvey et al., 2011); the Parara Limestone Formation (Stage 4), Ouldburra Formation (Stage 4), Andamooka Limestone Formation (Stage 3\u20134), the Parachilna Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Wilkawillina Limestone (Stage 3\u20134), and Memmerna Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Australia (Pl. 4. figs. 7\u201310 of Zang in Gravestock et al., 2001); the Mahto Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Alberta, Canada (fig. 6 of Butterfield, 2008); the Mount Cap Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 7b of Harvey and Butterfield, 2011); the Buen Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Greenland (fig. 3A\u2013U of Slater et al., 2018b; fig. 2 of Wallet et al., 2021); the File Haidar Formation (Stage 3\u20134), Sweden (Pl. 1. figs. 9, 10 of Hagenfeldt, 1989a; figs. 5\u20137 of Slater et al., 2017; Guilbaud et al., 2018; Kesidis et al., 2019); the L\u00e6s\u00e5 Formation (Stage 3), Denmark (fig. 8g of Moczyd\u0142owska and Vidal, 1992).\nPriapulid-like sclerites have also been extracted from Terreneuvian age strata, including; the Oksym Formation (Stage 2\u20133), Siberia (Pl. 1, figs. 4, 5 of Kontorovich et al., 2012); the Random Formation (Stage 2), Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland (fig. 7 of Palacios et al., 2018); the Kessyusa Formation (Fortunian\u2013Stage 2), Siberia (fig. 25 A\u2013C, E\u2013I of Nagovitsin, 2011); the Lontova and Voosi formations (Fortunian\u2013Stage 2), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia (fig. 4H\u2013O of Slater et al., 2018a). Various priapulid-like sclerites even feature among acid-isolated assemblages from the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary, including simple hook-shaped and serrated scalids from Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary strata of the Krak\u00f3w area (Pl. 2. fig. 14 and Pl. 3. figs. 2, 5 of Jachowicz-Zdanowska, 2014), and W\u0142odawa Formation, Poland (e.g., Moczyd\u0142owska et al., 2015) \u2013 in some instances these sclerites may even be detected in terminal Ediacaran strata (see Bilaterians section below).\nThese distinctive ecdysozoan sclerites rank among the earliest examples of a crown-bilaterian clade distinguishable in the fossil record (Fig. 6). An early emergence of priapulid-like remains among organic microfossils matches expectations from the record of trace fossils; a range of late Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian burrows (e.g. treptichnids and potentially Streptichnus) have been associated with the activities of a priapulid-like producer (Kesidis et al., 2019). Thus the trace fossil, phosphatised and organic microfossil records all point to an early evolution of worms with a priapulid-like body plan, and by extension suggest the emergence of total-group Ecdysozoa, or even total-group Cycloneuralia during the latest Ediacaran.\n\n\n3.10\nPalaeoscolecids\nPalaeoscolecids are an extinct group of ecdysozoan worms, distinguishable by their characteristic annulated trunk which is armoured with numerous small, discoidal plates (Hinz et al., 1990; Ivantsov and Wrona, 2004). Their dispersed phosphatic plates were first recognised among Cambrian SSFs, but articulated macrofossils were subsequently found in numerous deposits (e.g., Hou and Bergstr\u00f6m, 1994). Originally thought to be annelids (e.g., Glaessner, 1979), these armoured worms are now definitively assigned to the Ecdysozoa, and considered to represent either stem cycloneuralians (e.g., Budd, 2001) or a plesion of stem-priapulids (Harvey et al., 2010; Wills et al., 2012). From their dispersed SSF record, it is clear they were an important component of early Palaeozoic Cambrian\u2013Silurian marine faunas (e.g., M\u00fcller and Hinz-Schallreuter, 1993). The small plates that cover palaeoscolecids have also been recovered as isolated and semi-articulated arrays among SCFs. Such plates have been detected among palynological preparations from the Lower Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 File Haidar (Fig. 2o; fig. 5R\u2013V of Slater et al., 2017) and Miaolingian Wuliuan Stage Borgholm formations of Sweden (Slater et al., 2017), and from the Cambrian Miaolingian to Furongian Deadwood Formation, Saskatchewan, Canada (fig. 3d of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). To date, these SCF occurrences fall within the currently known range for palaeoscolecids (Fig. 6). As with other apparently mineralized taxa preserved as SCFs, it is unclear whether these plates are the remnant organic constituents of originally phosphatic plates, or are sourced from the armour of entirely non-biomineralizing palaeoscolecids.\n\n\n3.11\nLoriciferans\nExtant loriciferans are all minute and restricted to an interstitial habitat, and were only discovered as an extant phylum relatively recently (Kristensen, 2002). Currently, the oldest fossil assigned to the Loricifera is Sirilorica carlsbergi from the early Cambrian Sirius Passet Lagerst\u00e4tten in North Greenland (Peel, 2010), but this is a macroscopic taxon, more than a hundred times the size of any living loriciferan. Perhaps the most spectacular Cambrian SCFs found to date are the complete, miniaturised meiofaunal loriciferans from the Cambrian Miaolingian to Furongian Deadwood Formation in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. These fossils, assigned to the taxon Eolorica deadwoodensis, are known from >100 specimens, some of which represent more-or-less wholly intact lorica, complete with introvert and scalids (fig. 1d of Harvey and Butterfield, 2017). The significance of SCF loriciferans is also relevant to early bilaterian evolution \u2013 meiofaunal animals can demonstrably preserve as organic microfossils, and therefore any putative microscopic ancestors of bilaterian clades should be detectable in this record. Importantly, organic microfossils have no minimal size-limit set by grainsize resolution, unlike other forms of preservation, including trace fossils or even phosphatic preservation (which also captures microscopic animals in Cambrian, but not Ediacaran or older deposits).\n\n\n3.12\nLobopodians\nLobopodia are an extinct grade of panarthropod \u2018leg-bearing worms\u2019 that encompass important stem-group taxa to the three extant panarthropod crown-group phyla (Onychophora, Tardigrada and Arthropoda). As macrofossils they are mostly restricted to Burgess Shale-type Lagerst\u00e4tten in the Cambrian (with a few exceptions, e.g., Xenusion; Dzik and Krumbiegel, 1989). Outside their macrofossil record, the remains of armoured lobopodians have been identified among phosphatic small shelly fossils (e.g., Microdictyon).\nAmong the earliest SCF spines that appear in the fossil record are a subset of spines bearing a characteristic cone-in-cone construction (Fig. 2d). Initially described as Ceratophyton sp., these distinct morphologies were later assigned to a new species, Ceratophyton duplicum\nPa\u0161kevi\u010diene (1980). Moczyd\u0142owska (2008) raised the possibility that C. duplicum may be a taphomorph of C. vernicosum, suggesting that the \u2018double cones\u2019 could at least potentially represent an internal body that is usually degraded. However, recent comparison of relatively large spines found as SCFs (Butterfield, 1990, fig. 5) with articulated hallucigeniid macrofossils demonstrate that these carbonaceous spines are derived from the dorsal armature of lobopodian panarthropods (Caron et al., 2013; see also Rushtonites). Acid-extracted fossils recognised as hallucigeniid spines are reported from the Cambrian Stage 4\u20135 Mount Cap Formation, Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 5 of Butterfield, 1990; fig. 2a\u2013h of Caron et al., 2013) and Cambrian Stage 4 Forteau Formation, Newfoundland, Canada (fig. 2i\u2013k of Caron et al., 2013). Curved spines with a similar construction found as organic microfossils from the Kaili Formation (Wuliuan Stage) and Deadwood Formation (Miaolingian to Furongian) have also been interpreted as the appendicular claws of lobopods (fig. 7O of Harvey et al., 2011; fig. 4c\u2013e of extended data in Smith and Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez, 2014). Spines with this cone-in-cone construction have in fact been reported among organic microfossils from a number of studies, though their lobopod origin was not recognised. Indeed, the majority of spines assigned to C. duplicum are indistinguishable from the distal tips of carbonaceous halucigeniid spines (compare Pl. 38. figs. 4, 7, of Keller and Rozanov, 1979 and Pl. 7. figs. 3\u20134 and Pl. 14. fig. 13 of Pa\u0161kevi\u010diene, 1980 with fig. 2g\u2013h, j of Caron et al., 2013; spines reported in fig. 25D of Nagovitsin, 2011 described as \u2018nested conical sclerites\u2019 may also be an example of C. duplicum). Reported occurrences of C. duplicum from the earliest Cambrian Fortunian (e.g., the \u2018Rovno\u2019 beds of Lenningrad Oblast, Pl. 52. fig. 5 of Sokolov and Iwanowski, 1985; Jankauskas et al., 1989; Cambrian boundary strata of Poland, Jachowicz-Zdanowska, 2014) significantly predate the Stage 3 appearance (or Stage 2 if Rhombocorniculum is included) of halucigeniid spines elsewhere in the fossil record (cf. Caron et al., 2013). These isolated SCFs therefore reveal that lobopods of a halucigeniid grade were present in the Fortunian. Interestingly, this would make C. duplicum the oldest known body fossil evidence for panarthropoda, the next oldest being the first occurrence of trilobites (although the traces Monomorphichnus and Rusophycus are widely attributed to panarthropods; Jensen, 2003; M\u00e1ngano and Buatois, 2014). To date, accounts of the panarthropod fossil record currently omit this important body fossil evidence from Fortunian SCFs (e.g., Edgecombe and Legg, 2014; Wolfe et al., 2016; Daley et al., 2018; Giribet and Edgecombe, 2020; Aria, 2022).\n\n\n3.13\nBradoriids\nBradoriids are an extinct clade of Cambro-Ordovician bivalve arthropods with an extensive fossil record as calcium phosphate SSFs (Topper et al., 2011). As mineralized fossils they first appear in the early Cambrian (Stage 3), and probably predate the oldest records of trilobites in some regions (e.g., Australia; Topper et al., 2011). Among SCFs, the first remains to be recognised as bradoriids were the cardinal spines of bradoriid or Isoxys-like bivalve arthropods (see fig. 3W\u2013AK of Slater et al., 2018b; fig. 6V\u2013AF of Wallet et al., 2021), and fragments of ornamented cuticle and first order spines identified as Spinospitella from the early Cambrian (Stage 3\u20134) Buen Formation of North Greenland (fig. 2Q\u2013AI of Slater et al., 2018b). The bradoriid affinities of these isolated SCFs were later confirmed following the discovery of entirely articulated SCF specimens preserved as intact bradoriid valves (fig. 5 of Wallet et al., 2021). Unusually for SCF material, these bradoriid valves and fragments retain a significant degree of three-dimensionality (see fig. 4 of Wallet et al., 2021; fig. 3 of Peel et al., 2021). The lack of flattening among these SCFs suggests that secondary mineralization (e.g., phosphate) that made these fossils resistant to compaction has been lost to some extent during hydrofluoric acid processing (see Slater et al., 2018a,b). The recognition of bradoriid material among organic microfossils holds the prospect of capturing small-sized early ontogenetic stages, and extending the fossil record of this group into facies and regions where phosphatic\/phosphatized taphomorphs are not preserved.\n\n\n3.14\nTrilobites\nTrilobites, probably the most iconic of Cambrian fossils, have an exceptionally well documented macrofossil record (for a recent review see Paterson, 2020). By contrast, only a handful of studies have reported trilobite SCFs. Organic remains of trilobite cuticle have been described from the Cambrian Stage 4\u20135 Mount Cap Formation, Northwest Territories, Canada (fig. 3.1\u20133.2 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996), and from the Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 Buen Formation, North Greenland (Fig. 2t; fig. 2H\u2013P of Slater et al., 2018b; fig. 7 of Wallet et al., 2021). These trilobite-derived SCFs have so far been found exclusively within the currently understood range of this clade (Fig. 6). Extrapolations based on evolutionary rates or patterns of vicariance however, have suggested an earliest Cambrian Terreneuvian (Paterson et al., 2019), or even Proterozoic origin (Meert and Lieberman, 2008) for trilobites, implying that their conventionally understood fossil record from mineralized carapaces is preceded by a cryptic non-mineralized record. Continued SCF sampling of Terreneuvian strata offers one means to test hypotheses of a deeper unmineralized history for this clade.\n\n\n3.15\nCrustaceans\nRecent recognition of crustacean or stem-crustacean remains among acid-extractable organic microfossils has rewritten the early fossil record of Eucrustacea. Acid-digestion of Cambrian shales and mudstones has yielded a rich variety of exquisitely preserved mouthparts, feeding apparatus, appendages, setae and other distinctive components attributable to crustaceans or stem-crustaceans, revealing an otherwise entirely hidden Cambrian radiation of crustaceans (Fig. 6). For instance, functionally distinctive mandibles identified among Cambrian SCFs have pushed back the known fossil record of particle-feeding crustaceans by ~100\u00a0Ma (Harvey and Butterfield, 2008; Harvey et al., 2012a; Harvey and Pedder, 2013; Wallet et al., 2021). Sub-micron structures preserved in such specimens demonstrate that organic microfossils are capable of capturing a level of detail that is qualitatively different from other modes of fossilisation (see section on Taphonomic limitations below). Identifiable crustacean SCFs include ostracod, copepod and branchiopod-like SCFs from the Furongian Deadwood Formation, Saskatchewan, Canada (Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b), copepod mandibles and the filter plates of branchiopod-like crustaceans from the Miaolingian\/Furongian Nolinchucky Shale of Tennessee (Pedder, 2012; Harvey and Pedder, 2013), an extremely diverse range of specialised crustacean-like appendages, setae and feeding apparatus from the Stage 4\u20135 Mount Cap Formation, NWT, Canada (Butterfield, 1994; Harvey and Butterfield, 2008), possible remains of a branchiopod-like appendage from the Stage 3\u20134 File Haidar Formation, Sweden (fig. 13 of Vidal, 1998), and filter-feeding appendages and mandible-like components from the Stage 3\u20134 Buen Formation, North Greenland (fig. 8 of Wallet et al., 2021). These phylogenetically and functionally informative structures are opening up an entirely new perspective into the early evolution of this major arthropod clade. Importantly, the detection of complex filter-feeding apparatus produced by small-bodied Cambrian arthropods provides a unique insight into the fossil record of zooplankton grazers from a time when Phanerozoic-style marine trophic structure was first being established (Butterfield, 1997, 2000, 2007).\n\n\n3.16\nPterobranchs\nPterobranchia are a phylum of (mostly) colonial, benthic hemichordates that produce a cluster of secreted dwelling tubes, known as a tubarium. Acid-isolated portions of flattened pterobranch tubarium have been recovered from the basal Wuliuan Stage Kaili Formation, Guizhou Province, China (Harvey et al., 2011), the Cambrian Stage 4 upper part of the File Haidar Formation, Sweden (personal observation), and from the Cambrian Stage 3\u20134 Buen Formation in North Greenland (Slater et al., 2018b; Fig. 2c). These organic microfossils predate the oldest macroscopic evidence for pterobranchs, which consists of various carbonaceous compressions in Cambrian Stage 4\u20135 BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten (e.g., Sphenoecium wheelerensis\nMaletz and Steiner, 2015). A probable earlier occurrence of pterobranchs however \u2013 also as SCFs \u2013 are the organic tubes Sokoloviina costata (Kiryanov, 1968), known from the earliest Cambrian Fortunian Stage, from the Rovno (Ukraine) (Pl. 3. figs. 4\u20138 of Kiryanov, 1968) and Lontova Formation (Estonia) (fig. 5 of Slater et al., 2018a). Most authors have considered this taxon a problematicum, but several studies have discussed a pterobranch affinity for S. costata (e.g., Hu et al., 2018; Maletz, 2019; Ram\u00edrez-Guerro and Cameron, 2021), which if true, would comprise the oldest record of this clade by a substantial margin. The tubes of S. costata are often opaque and deeply crinkled making it difficult to observe diagnostic features, but SCF fragments of S. costata from the Rovno of Ukraine figured by Sokolov (Pl. 8. figs. 2 and 4, of Sokolov, 1997) clearly show bona fide fuselli in one specimen \u2013 a diagnostic synapomorphy of the Pterobranchia. Similar fuselli are also observable in certain specimens from the Lontova Formation of Estonia (Fig. 2a, h [fig. 5H of Slater et al., 2018a]). On these grounds, the fossil record of total-group pterobranchs should be extended into the Cambrian Fortunian (Fig. 6).\n\n\n3.17\nEldonia\nCarbonaceous fragments of Eldonia gut have been acid-isolated from macrofossils and palynological preparations of the Burgess Shale (fig. 1 of Butterfield, 1996; Gostlin, 2006). Though these fragments are directly extracted from macrofossils, their survival of acid-maceration illustrates the exceptionally broad range of tissue types that may preserve as organic microfossils.\n\n\n3.18\nParaconodonts\nParaconodonts comprise a selection of distinctive calcium-phosphate dental sclerites found in Palaeozoic deposits. The disarticulated nature of these fossils means that the paraconodont organism itself remains poorly understood, but based on their histology and microstructure they are considered to be chordates (ancestral to the euconodonts; Murdock et al., 2013). The oldest paraconodonts comprise phosphatic SSFs found in various Miaolingian Wuliuan Stage localities globally (e.g., M\u00fcller, 1970; Dong, 2004; Dutro Jr et al., 1984; Lee, 2013). Acid-extracted carbonaceous paraconodont elements are known from younger Cambrian Miaolingian to Furongian sediments of the Deadwood Formation, Saskatchewan, Canada (e.g., Westergaardodina sp., fig. 2H, I of Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b; fig. 3C of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). These examples highlight the potential for detecting Cambrian chordates among organic microfossils, and add to the limited but significant range of deuterostomes discovered as SCFs.\n\n\n3.19\nBilaterians\nIn terminal Ediacaran sediments (~555\u2013539\u00a0Ma; Linnemann et al., 2019), Ediacaran macrofossils are joined by the first complex trace fossils (Fig. 7\n). These burrows were clearly produced by animals with complex sensory systems (Budd and Jensen, 2017) and represent the oldest fossil evidence for bilaterian animals \u2013 the group that would go on to transform every aspect of the biosphere. At present, however, macrofossil remains of these bilaterian animals are lacking. Several late Ediacaran sites have produced cast and moulds in sandstones preserving trails and body outlines of motile organisms that are potentially attributable to total-group bilateria, or \u2018bilateromorpha\u2019 (Chen et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the only definitive body fossil evidence for total group bilaterians in the late Ediacaran comes from organic microfossils.\nBilaterian remains among organic microfossils extracted from formations spanning the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary have produced simple hook-shaped and more complex serrated scalidophoran-like sclerites (e.g., Zang et al., 2007; Moczyd\u0142owska et al., 2015; Jachowicz-Zdanowska, 2014; Nagovitsin, 2011), lobopod spines (e.g., Pa\u0161kevi\u010diene, 1980; Sokolov and Iwanowski, 1985), and protoconodont elements (e.g., Aseeva, 1974; Kiryanov, 1968 in Kiryanov, 1968; Sokolov and Iwanowski, 1985; Moczyd\u0142owska, 2008; Palacios et al., 2018). Other less phylogenetically constrained bilaterian-derived SCFs from the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary include a transversely annulated spine from the boundary interval at Fortune Head in Newfoundland (fig. 4e of Palacios et al., 2018), a sub-triangular cuticular fragment recovered from the Mara Member, Nama Group, Namibia (fig. 6j of Agi\u0107 et al., 2021), protoconodont-like elements from the Ediacaran Kotlin Formation of Estonia (fig. 12\u00a0J, K of Arvest\u00e5l and Willman, 2020), and the taxon Disnella forcipata, comprising falcate hook-shaped elements from the \u2018Rovno\u2019 stage (late Ediacaran\u2013Fortunian) of the Baltic region (e.g., plates 7.2 and 11.1 of Pa\u0161kevi\u010diene, 1980; Jankauskas et al., 1989). These latter forms resemble the robust hooks with prominent basal spurs found in the introverts of scalidophorans, and possibly originate from early ecdysozoan worms. An SCF described as an \u2018arthropod extremity\u2019 from Cambrian Stage 2 strata of Spain may also rank among the oldest body fossil evidence for panarthropods, however, this sclerite is difficult to distinguish from those produced by scalidophorans (fig. 7g of Palacios and Vidal, 1992). Presence of scalidophoran-like and lobopodian-derived sclerites in basalmost Cambrian strata already implies a degree of ecdysozoan diversification by the opening of the Cambrian Period \u2013 a pattern also suggested by the early diversification of ecdysozoan-like trace fossils (e.g., Kesidis et al., 2019). SCF sclerites from the late Ediacaran of Finland represent the oldest known protoconodont spines (Fig. 2l; Willman and Slater, 2021), and constitute the oldest body fossil remains of crown-group Bilateria. Taken together, the earliest remains of bilaterians among organic microfossils imply the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes by the late Ediacaran, and suggest that ecdysozoans and chaetognath-like bilaterians were among the first definitively crown-group bilaterians to evolve. Other somewhat older but more problematic SCFs that may derive from early bilaterians (e.g., Redkinia) are discussed below.\n\n\n3.20\nProblematica\nAlongside the phylogenetically constrained remains discussed above, the organic microfossil record also contains a plethora of distinctive microfossils of more ambiguous affinities, some of which are feasibly sourced from metazoans. Of interest here are several SCF taxa found in late Ediacaran and Cambrian boundary strata, in particular Redkinia, Cochleatina and Saarina.\n\nRedkinia comprises a curved carbonaceous strap, tapering toward one end and bearing prominent serrations along one margin \u2013 the two described form taxa (R. spinosa\nSokolov, 1977 and R. fedonkini\nAseeva, 1988) differing in the morphology of their serrations. Redkinia is known from late Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian siliciclastic sequences from Siberia, the East European Platform and Australia, both as acid-extractable SCFs (Pl. 11. figs. 1\u20139 of Aseeva, 1983a; Pl. 18. figs. 8, 9 of Aseeva, 1983b; Sokolov, 1977, 1990; Pl. 3. figs. 3a\u2013c of Burzin, 1995; fig. 6G of Jago et al., 2006; fig. 9G, H of Zang et al., 2007), and in slightly larger specimens as carbonaceous mesofossil impressions on bedding surfaces (e.g., Pl. 88. figs. 1\u20135 of Sokolov, 1977; fig. 6 of Sokolov, 1984; Pl. 13. fig. 4 of Sokolov, 1997; fig. 2A of Golubkova et al., 2018). Redkinia was originally interpreted as a polychaete jaw (Sokolov, 1977, 1990), but has also been likened to arthropod cuticle (Runnegar and Fedonkin, 1992), arthropod mandibles (Conway Morris, 1993), or molluscan radulae (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). While it is tempting to interpret Redkinia as a mouthpart of some kind, such precise assignments are problematic for several reasons; first, the interpretation of Redkinia as a scolecodont (or arthropod mandible, or molluscan radula) does not rest upon a particularly firm functional morphology basis. The slender, delicate serrations of Redkinia contrast with the robust grinding and scraping elements adorning polychaete jaws, arthropod mandibles and molluscan radulae. Second, having been found only from Ediacaran sediments of the local Baltic\/Siberian \u2018Redkino\u2019 stage (see Meidla, 2017) and Australian equivalent, Redkinia predates the earliest fossil total-group annelids (Fig. 6; Cambrian), and jawed polychaetes (Errantia; Ordovician) by a substantial margin. This would imply a vast ghost-range for structures with an otherwise high fossilisation potential (a similar case stands against them being arthropod mandibles or molluscan radulae). Given its relatively complex morphology, bipartite spinose construction and late Ediacaran age, Redkinia is nevertheless a plausible total-group bilaterian, and should be considered among the foremost candidates for early bilaterian fossils.\nAlso found among late Ediacaran to earliest Cambrian SCF assemblages are the enigmatic serrated spirals known as Cochleatina (Fig. 2s). Reports of Cochleatina principally come from sediments of the palaeocontinent Baltica, but it is also known from Siberia, Iran and Avalonian parts of Newfoundland (e.g., Pa\u0161kevi\u010diene, 1980; Jankauskas et al., 1989; Burzin, 1995; Sokolov, 1997; Palacios et al., 2018; see compilation of records in Slater et al., 2020). The unnamed serrated metazoan fragment figured by Moczyd\u0142owska (1991, Pl. 15. fig. D) among organic microfossils from the Terreneuvian Mazowsze Formation of Poland may also be a portion of Cochleatina. As with Redkinia, it has been proposed that Cochleatina is sourced from a metazoan mouthpart (e.g., Burzin, 1995; Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). Despite its morphological complexity, the affinities of Cochleatina are nevertheless unclear, and though a metazoan affinity is entirely plausible, a protistan or algal affinity cannot be excluded (Slater et al., 2020).\n\nSaarina, another late Ediacaran to earliest Cambrian SCF taxon, is an organic tubular fossil comprising a series of stacked funnels, potentially representing the dwelling tube of a cnidarian-grade animal (Sokolov, 1965). As with Redkinia, Saarina has been found as both carbonaceous compression fossils and acid-extracted organic microfossils (e.g., Gnilovskaya, 1996; Kolosov and Sofroneeva, 2018). Several authors have remarked on the similarity between this taxon and the mineralized tubes of Cloudina and other cloudiniids\/cloudinomorphs (e.g., Selly et al., 2020) \u2013 in this view Saarina may represent an organically preserved taphomorph of a cloudiniid. Cloudiniids are a group of tubular metazoan fossils of unknown affinity with a late Ediacaran to earliest Cambrian age range. Detection of comparable organic tubes among organic microfossils adds to the congruence across taphonomic modes, and suggests that the widespread appearance metazoan-derived tubular fossils in sediments of this age likely represents a genuine evolutionary signal (Budd and Jackson, 2016).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nDespite the substantial number of studies stretching back to the Tonian (Fig. 5; each of which may survey potentially thousands of microfossils) not a single metazoan fragment has been detected until the late Ediacaran, roughly in tandem with the first appearance of bilaterian traces in the ichnological record. From the late Ediacaran onwards, there is a more-or-less continuous smattering of metazoan-derived fragments found among organic-walled microfossil assemblages (Fig. 5). Though this record is still relatively underdeveloped in comparison to the intensively documented trace fossil and macrofossil records, the emerging pattern is nevertheless striking. Already the oldest known body fossil evidence for a number of key metazoan clades, including the Chaetognatha, Annelida, Priapulida, \u2018lobopods\u2019 and Panarthropoda, Crustacea, Pterobranchia, and possibly the Bilateria are to be found among organic microfossils (Fig. 6). Also detected are the recognisable remains of poriferans, chancelloriids, palaeoscolecids, loriciferans, bradoriids, trilobites, lophotrochozoans including wiwaxiids, molluscs, hyoliths and brachiopods, and chordates (paraconodonts). Other groups remain undetected or are entirely missing \u2013 notable absences include ctenophores and echinoderms (excluding some acid-isolated fragments of Eldonia).\nThis newly assembled record represents a useful first appraisal, yet any tentative trends must be appropriately considered in the context of spatiotemporally uneven sampling, non-standardized laboratory preparation techniques, questions relating to taphonomy, and within the framework of the fossil record more broadly. The following section addresses some of these issues and offers practical steps for improving future sampling.\n\n\n5\nLimitations of the organic\/carbonaceous fossil record\n\n5.1\nSampling at the temporal and (palaeo)geographic scale\nAcross the study interval, sampling has a more-or-less global coverage (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the dataset reveals considerable unevenness in the geographic scope of the current organic microfossil record. For instance, Antarctica is essentially unexamined, and a relatively small number of the examined studies (23 studies from 28 formations) have been conducted across Africa (Fig. 4). At the temporal scale, research efforts have not been focussed evenly. Certain stratigraphic intervals have been sampled more intensively than others \u2013 especially when accounting for the fact that longer intervals such as the Tonian represent some 280\u00a0Ma. As a general rule, sampling intensity tends to decrease with age across the study interval (Fig. 5). Some of this can be attributed to the greater area of accessible strata in the Phanerozoic record (e.g., Cambrian) in comparison to older Proterozoic intervals (note however that aside from deep sea sediments, sedimentary rock volume does not decrease exponentially with age; Husson and Peters, 2018; Peters and Husson, 2017), but other factors such as the finer-scale discrimination of Phanerozoic rock formations and increased likelihood of metamorphism with age likely play a role. Cambrian and Ediacaran intervals yielded the largest number of productive formations (Fig. 5), though it is worth pointing out that collectively, the Tonian, Cryogenian and early Ediacaran records encompass a comparable number of formations (n. 164.3) to that of the Cambrian portion of the dataset (n. 169.8), yet the former show no records of Metazoan remains. Within the Cambrian, South America and Australia are comparatively undersampled, and whilst metazoan SCFs have been detected in younger Cambrian strata from Australia and South America in some instances (e.g., from Miaolingian strata of the Llanos Basin of Colombia; Smith et al., 2015a), sampling around the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary remains patchy when compared to other regions. Current patterns appear shaped by intensified worker effort of palaeontologists in relatively accessible regions, and around outcrops\/formations that are particularly productive for organic microfossils (akin to the \u2018bonanza effect\u2019 described by Dunhill et al., 2012). Indeed, the majority of organic microfossil studies in the dataset are sourced from the Cambrian palaeocontinents of Laurentia (roughly corresponding to modern North America) and Baltica (northern and eastern Europe), with significant studies from Siberia, Avalonia, South China, and other peri-Gondwanan terranes (e.g., from Belgium, Czech Republic, Iran, Spain). Identification of undersampled regions and time-windows will help to direct future sampling \u2013 in particular, a concerted effort to improve records from southern hemisphere (Gondwanan) continents is warranted. With anticipated advances in the subdivision of Neoproterozoic stratigraphy and time, a finer-scale resolution of Tonian, Cryogenian and Ediacaran records may be usefully developed in future studies.\n\n\n5.2\nTechniques in palynology\nA further caveat relates not to worker effort at the level of outcrop, but to biases introduced in the laboratory. The constituents of an assemblage of organic microfossils ultimately depends upon the original biological community, filtered through the various taphonomic pathways that either impede or aid fossilisation. The composition of the final assemblage, however, is also influenced by the laboratory extraction and mounting techniques that are used. Variations in microfossil processing, sieving and recovery methods can therefore introduce another potential source of bias into this record. For example, processing procedures designed to maximise the recovery of smaller-sized, robust palynomorphs (such as acritarchs) typically employ practices such as the centrifugation of residues, heavy liquid separation, boiling in HCl, vacuum pumping and strew-mounting onto slides. These procedures tend to result in the breakup of larger and more delicate SCFs (Butterfield and Harvey, 2012; Slater et al., 2018a) \u2013 this increased degree of fragmentation could conceivably hamper the identification of some metazoan-derived remains in conventional palynological preparations. More gentle SCF-style processing and hand-picking of individual organic microfossils has a history of usage among studies focused on deposits of the East European Platform (see Burzin, 1989; Slater et al., 2020), a factor which may have contributed to the relatively developed SCF record from that region (Fig. 4). Despite these concerns, metazoan remains demonstrably survive conventional palynological processing (Fig. 8\n), and frequently occur as a minor component of standard acritarch preparations (e.g., Harvey and Pedder, 2013). In any case, there has been no tendency to use gentler techniques in younger strata \u2013 if anything, the inverse is true. Until recently, the use of more sensitive extraction techniques has been employed more frequently in studies focused on Proterozoic deposits; the fragile larger acritarchs and filamentous microfossils that typify Proterozoic assemblages (see Fig. 2) are liable to fragmentation and mechanical destruction. Consequently, studies targeting Proterozoic strata have tended to employ gentler processing and hand-picking techniques more often than equivalent studies focussed on younger material (e.g., Burzin, 1989; Grey, 1999; Zang and Walter, 1992; Butterfield et al., 1994; Tang et al., 2017). Even with the substantial number of such analyses performed on Proterozoic sediments, convincing metazoan fragments remain undetected prior to the late Ediacaran.\n\n\n5.3\nTaphonomic limitations; a record of cuticles?\nVariation in histology is a fundamental control determining which animal-derived tissues are present or absent as organic microfossils. The majority of metazoan remains among Cambrian SCF assemblages are the remains of cuticles (e.g., Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b; Harvey and Pedder, 2013; Smith et al., 2015b; Slater et al., 2018b; Wallet et al., 2021). Given this predominance, it is worth asking whether this taphonomic mode is in essence simply a record of cuticles, and by extension, a signal of the onset of cuticularization in metazoans (perhaps akin to the record of shelly fossils that heralds the onset of biomineralization). Putting aside arguments of homology vs. independent acquisition of cuticles across metazoan lineages, there are nevertheless reasons to think this prevalence of cuticles largely reflects the inundation of the record by the emergence of the moulting clade Ecdysozoa, rather than an intrinsic limitation of this record to cuticles. Ecdysozoans periodically shed resistant cuticle into the environment throughout their lifespan. Importantly, many ecdysozoan cuticles exhibit morphologically characteristic subcomponents that are readily recognisable as disarticulated elements among SCF preparations; for example the \u2018scalids\u2019 and \u2018teeth\u2019 of cycloneuralian worms (Smith et al., 2015b; Slater et al., 2017), and the repeated polygonal microsculpturing seen on the cuticles of euarthropods (Hadley, 1986). Whilst the remains of ecdysozoans numerically dominate most (but not all) Cambrian age SCF assemblages, following the Cambrian, the record of organic microfossils becomes swamped with other non-cuticular metazoan elements (most obviously scolecodonts, representing the Ordovician emergence of sclerotized jaws in eunicid and phyllodocid annelids).\nIndeed, there is evidence that metazoan preservation among organic microfossils can encompass a wide-range of degradation resistant acellular and acuticular tissues, providing such structures are resistant to thermal alteration, acetolysis and proteolytic decay. Many bilaterians for instance produce sclerotized or tanned jaws and other feeding apparatus that are particularly recalcitrant without being biomineralized. As organic microfossils, these comprise the aforementioned scolecodonts (e.g., Eriksson et al., 2016), but also molluscan radulae (Butterfield, 2008), and other bilaterian mouthparts (fig. 3 of Smith et al., 2015a; fig. 10 of Slater et al., 2017). Other metazoan remains among organic microfossils include epidermal extracellular structures such as the chaetae or setae of lophotrochozoan protostomes. In this category are the furcate chaetae of annelids (Slater et al., 2017; Slater and Willman, 2019), and the dorsal sclerites of Wiwaxia, which have been widely detected as SCFs in Cambrian Stage 3 to Drumian sediments globally (see figs. 13\u201314 of Slater et al., 2017). A diverse range of metazoans secrete dwelling tubes or structures composed of organic material that can preserve as acid-extracted organic microfossils. Examples include pterobranch (Harvey et al., 2011; Slater et al., 2018b; Maletz, 2020) and graptolite (e.g., Skoglund, 1961; Maletz, 2010) hemichordates, which produce a secreted tubarium composed of collagen or chitin. Even the fragmentary polyps and tentacles of hydrozoans (which lack cuticles) can occur as organic microfossils in Phanerozoic rocks (Mendon\u00e7a Filho et al., 2016; Mota et al., 2016; Fonseca et al., 2018).\nAmong organic microfossils, there is also significant overlap with records from skeletal and shelly fossils; alongside their mineral composition, biomineralized structures typically contain a substantial organic content. This can take the form of an organic matrix that may include polysaccharides like chitin and proteins such as collagen, or in some taxa, the shell itself is encased by a proteinaceous periostracum. Following dissolution of shell material, this remaining organic component may be compressed into a film and preserved among SCFs (Harvey and Butterfield, 2011; Mart\u00ed Mus, 2014). Biomineralized metazoans with an SCF record include brachiopods (fig. 3.3\u20133.4 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; fig. 4a of Harvey and Butterfield, 2011; fig. 2F\u2013H of Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b), palaeoscolecids (fig. 3d of Butterfield and Harvey, 2012; fig. 5R\u2013V of Slater et al., 2018a), trilobites (fig. 3.1\u20133.2 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; fig. 2H\u2013P of Slater et al., 2018b), bivalved arthropods (fig. 2Q\u2013AI of Slater et al., 2018b), hyoliths (fig. 4 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; Harvey and Butterfield, 2011; Mart\u00ed Mus, 2014), tentaculitids (Filipiak and Jarzynka, 2009; Kondas and Filipiak, 2021), and chancelloriids (fig. 5 of Butterfield and Nicholas, 1996; fig. 2B\u2013E of Harvey et al., 2012a, 2012b). A similar mechanism may also account for SCF preservation of protoconodonts (fig. 9 of Slater et al., 2017; see also discussion in Slater et al., 2018a, 2018b) and paraconodonts (e.g., Westergaardodina sp., Butterfield and Harvey, 2012), as well as the collagenous sheaths of sponge spicules (Fig. 2b; see also Harvey, 2010). These de-mineralized SCFs collectively capture the remains of taxa that construct their skeletons from minerals as varied as calcite, aragonite, calcium phosphate and silica (Kouchinsky et al., 2012). This style of preservation enables the detection of biomineralizing groups in facies that otherwise preclude the preservation of shelly fossils, and importantly, unlocks the possibility of detecting any putative preskeletonized ancestors.\nNumerous authors have postulated that ancestral bilaterians were acuticular, miniscule, or meiofaunal, and consequently may have evaded fossilisation entirely (e.g., Boaden, 1989; Platt, 1981; Valentine, 1994; Erwin and Davidson, 2002; Laumer et al., 2015; Sperling and Stockey, 2018). Although such delicate forms would be invisible to most types of fossilisation, here again they may still be detectable as organic microfossils. First, meiofaunal bilaterian clades once thought to be unfossilisable have since been recovered as SCFs (e.g., Loricifera; Harvey and Butterfield, 2017). In principle, even acuticular bilaterians may have produced extrinsic structures which can preserve as SCFs. Extrinsic structures found as organic microfossils include coprolites (fig. 5 of Harvey and Butterfield, 2011; fig. 9F\u2013J of Slater et al., 2018a; fig. 3AL\u2013AN of Slater et al., 2018b), secreted cocoons (Tosolini and Pole, 2010; Bomfleur et al., 2012, 2015; McLoughlin et al., 2016) and egg cases (e.g., van Waveren, 1994; Tosolini and Pole, 2010; Pedder, 2012). Entirely acuticular metazoans (e.g., chaetognaths, ctenophores, medusozoans) can demonstrably form macroscopic carbonaceous compressions (Conway Morris and Collins, 1996; Briggs and Caron, 2017; Fu et al., 2019), although whether such integument survives acid-digestion remains to be investigated.\nAll of this is not to mention the huge variety of non-metazoan non-cuticular structures preserved as organic microfossils, comprising various prokaryotes, actively growing eukaryotes, foraminiferal linings, fungi and algae. Indeed, in some cases such non-metazoan organic microfossils may even facilitate the preservation of metazoan remains. Delicate metazoan structures can fossilise via templating or imprinting into extraneous organic material consisting of microbial biofilms or sapproppel (e.g., Slater et al., 2020), macroalgae (e.g., Gnilovskaya, 1988), or by fusion with other organic remains (e.g., acritarchs; Slater and Willman, 2019). In a similar fashion, fossils of seemingly unpreservable ciliates (e.g., vorticella), and even sperm have been discovered amalgamated\/incorporated into larger SCFs (Bomfleur et al., 2012, 2015; McLoughlin et al., 2016). Furthermore, abundant remains of otherwise undetected fossil nannoplankton have recently been discovered as detailed imprints within acid-extracted amorphous organic matter (Slater et al., 2022). Clearly acid-extracted organic microfossils can capture a remarkably diverse assortment of ancient life, and most animal clades produce at least some structures that could be detected among organic microfossils. While this mode of fossilisation should not be regarded as a taphonomic panacea, the list of characters any cryptic Tonian\/Cryogenian\/early Ediacaran metazoans could possess is severely diminished when the organic, shelly and trace fossil records are taken together.\n\n\n\n6\nThe Proterozoic record\nRecently increased awareness of animal remains among organic microfossils has already pushed back the fossil records of several metazoan clades (Fig. 6). It seems likely therefore, that as exploratory efforts continue, further animal clades will be detected among Cambrian organic microfossils and their known fossil records will be extended. But how far back might these records be extended? Our data show that while metazoan fragments are found among numerous Cambrian and several late Ediacaran assemblages, there has been a consistent failure to detect animal remains from the large number of equivalent palynological preparations from older strata, throughout the Proterozoic (Fig. 5).\nGiven that organic microfossils exhibit comparatively relaxed taphonomic constraints, this pattern may have important implications. If animals originated in the Tonian (cf. Dohrmann and W\u00f6rheide, 2017; Sperling and Stockey, 2018; Costa-Paiva et al., 2021), this implies a delay in the order of 300\u2013400\u00a0Ma before small animal fragments enter the record of organic microfossils \u2013 despite the abundant preservation of various bacteria, protists and algae as organic microfossils throughout the hundreds of millions of years-worth of strata that record this period. Alternatively, this pattern is explicable by recourse to an Ediacaran origin for the Metazoa and later the Bilateria (cf. Budd and Jensen, 2017). In this latter view, search efforts to detect basal bilaterians among organic microfossils are fruitfully targeted at late Ediacaran (e.g., Willman and Slater, 2021) and early Cambrian sediments (e.g., Slater et al., 2018a), whilst organic microfossils extracted from older Neoproterozoic sediments from the Tonian and Cryogenian will continue to be devoid of animal remains \u2013 of course, detection or recognition of definitive animal remains from these older strata would falsify this hypothesis.\n\n6.1\nOlder putative metazoans among Proterozoic organic microfossils\nAmong organic microfossils, sporadic claims for ancient Proterozoic animal remains have been made. We critically evaluate these incidences here.\nIn several studies, strap-shaped organic microfossils extracted from Mesoproterozoic\u2013Tonian age strata have been attributed to annelids or nematodes (see Gnilovskaya et al., 2000; Herman and Podkovyrov, 2005, 2010; Hermann and Podkovyrov, 2007). These fossils are assignable to the form-taxon Rugosoopsis (e.g., fig. 1 of Hermann and Podkovyrov, 2007) and are demonstrably the sheaths of bacterial filaments (Samuelsson and Butterfield, 2001). These filamentous microfossils display characters such as division into a trichome, and specialised necridia (shrivelled cells that facilitate breakage), features that are seen in extant oscillatorian cyanobacteria (Lamont, 1969; Speziale and Dyck, 1992). Indeed these forms are widely attributed to non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria when found elsewhere in the fossil record (e.g., Butterfield et al., 1994; Willman and Slater, 2021). Putative sponges have been reported among Mesoproterozoic\u2013Tonian organic microfossils (Hermann and Podkovyrov, 2012). These reports consist of cell aggregates adhered to the surface of various acritarchs and sapropel films, and have been compared to the blastula of extant sponges. Nevertheless, these simple cell aggregates lack any discernible features to link them to sponges, or indeed any other particular clade of prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Another interesting case is that of putative HF-extracted \u2018faecal pellets\u2019 from early Proterozoic mudrocks (Robbins et al., 1985), however, these organic pellets do not fulfil the criteria required for attribution to coprolites or bromalites (for example, they lack any discernible contents other than amorphous organic matter, and do not exhibit any diagnostic morphology).\nThe strongest case made for animals among Proterozoic organic microfossils is the claim that various large (>100\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) acanthomorphic acritarchs may be the remains of animal egg cases (e.g., van Waveren and Marcus, 1993; Vorob'eva and Sergeev, 2018; Cohen et al., 2009). This argument is based on the observed similarity between the ornamented surface sculpture of these acritarchs and that of some diapause egg cysts (e.g., those produced by copepod crustaceans). There are nevertheless several difficulties with this hypothesis; one is the inherent difficulty in determining the precise affinity of simple morphological structures prone to convergence \u2013 in this case organic spheroids with spinose ornamentation. Another issue is that symmetrical spiny acritarchs, common in the early Ediacaran, in fact largely disappear from the late-Ediacaran record, precisely when convincing evidence for metazoans emerges among the body and trace fossil records (Knoll et al., 2006). Moreover, it is unclear why diapause egg cases would preserve in abundance prior to the known body fossil record of animals, but subsequently become scarce in the Phanerozoic when clades known to produce such eggs are common as body fossils. Further, when acritarchs of the same taxa have been found phosphatised, they do not contain a developing animal embryo (though phosphatised Cambrian examples of developing animal embryos are common; e.g., Zhang et al., 2011). Nevertheless, since definitive egg cases are known in the Phanerozoic record among organic microfossils (e.g., \u2018Acritarch sp. 1\u2019 which represent diapause eggs from the Cambrian Miaolingian\/Furongian Nolinchucky Shale of Tennessee, Plate 21 of Pedder, 2012), the nature of putative fossil animal egg cases should be interrogated on a case-by-case basis.\nOutside the record of organic microfossils, there have been a variety of claims for substantially older animal fossils (e.g., Seilacher et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2004; Turner, 2021; Kris and McMenamin, 2021), yet none of these singleton examples have gained acceptance as convincing animals (see Anderson et al., 2016; Budd and Jensen, 2000; Conway Morris, 2002; Bengtson and Budd, 2004; Bengtson et al., 2012; Bobrovskiy et al., 2021). Other than their ambiguous morphology, a major problem with these isolated cases are the phylogenetic implications (Budd, 2013). If, for instance, a given fossil is diagnosable to a recognisable derived bilaterian clade (e.g., annelids), then this would automatically imply a significant contemporaneous diversification of bilaterian lineages \u2013 each of which could plausibly leave fossils. Thus a true radiation should be expected to generate a clustering of first appearances of major bilaterian clades in the fossil record \u2013 a pattern that is curiously evident in the Cambrian fossil record of organic microfossils (Fig. 6).\n\n\n6.2\nImplications for constraining animal origins\nIn the case of the first appearances of specific clades (Fig. 6), we caution against reading this trend too literally since certain clades are known only from a single deposit, and so records are liable to change substantially as this mode of preservation is increasingly explored. Despite this, at a coarser scale of resolution (e.g., Bilateria as a whole) the general pattern is more likely to reflect an evolutionary signal. Each of these detected animal clades are part of a nested evolutionary tree, and the collective clustering of multiple first appearances of sub-clades within the Cambrian (Fig. 6) is unlikely to be an artefact (Budd and Mann, 2020). The pattern of multiple first appearances of major bilaterian clades observed within the Cambrian is therefore likely driven by an underlying evolutionary radiation during this time.\nCumulative records of the presence\/absence of metazoans among organic microfossils (Fig. 5) can also help to constrain when animals first evolved. Fossil bearing deposits such as the ca. 820\u00a0Ma Svanbergfjellet Formation and ca. 810\u00a0Ma Bitter Springs Chert have been singled out as a soft-maximum age with which to constrain the Metazoa (Benton et al., 2015). Yet the absence of animals from the collective Tonian, Cryogenian, and early Ediacaran records of organic microfossils is no less conspicuous than their absence from a single assemblage of organic microfossils (Svanbergfjellet Formation) or a particular chert deposited in a hypersaline lagoon (Bitter Springs).\nClearly though, even where organic microfossil records overlap with the known fossil record of animals, animal remains are only detected in a subset of investigations (Fig. 5). Yet as the hypothetical age of the Metazoa and root of the tree is extended farther back in time, the number of studied assemblages where animals have evaded fossilisation and\/or detection among organic microfossils increases. A concerted focus on Ediacaran organic microfossils would feasibly help to constrain when animals first evolved.\n\n\n\n7\nNomenclature\nThe earliest studies which recovered and described Cambrian age metazoan remains among organic microfossils (e.g., reports of Ceratophyton-type spines; Kiryanov, 1968; Volkova et al., 1979) were conducted at around the same time as early investigations of Cambrian phosphatic\/phosphatized small shelly fossils (SSFs), (e.g., Matthews and Missarzhevsky, 1975 which coined the term \u2018small shelly fossils\u2019). Despite this, the intervening years have seen an explosion of studies centred on SSFs, but there has not been an equivalent appreciation for the variety of metazoan-derived components among organic microfossils sourced from siliciclastic deposits until much more recently (see Butterfield and Harvey, 2012). Perhaps in part this has been due to the tendency for workers to treat organic-walled remains under the concept of acritarchs (Evitt, 1963), a term which at several points has (erroneously) taken on an implied biological status (see discussions in Servais et al., 1996; Javaux and Knoll, 2017; Colbath and Grenfell, 1995; Agi\u0107 and Cohen, 2021). In contrast, phosphatic\/phosphatized and calcitic material has typically been examined under the umbrella term \u2018small shelly fossils\u2019 or \u2018small skeletal fossils\u2019 \u2013 whilst not without drawbacks (see criticisms of the term \u2018small shelly fossils\u2019 in Steiner et al., 2007), this catch-all term is broad enough to accommodate both fossils that may represent essentially \u2018complete\u2019 organisms and those which may be components of multi-element scleritomes. Although fragmentary animal remains have frequently been detected in palynological preparations, such fragments have typically been categorised simply as \u2018zooclasts\u2019 or \u2018zoomorphs\u2019 which omits any finer-scale phylogenetic context, or in some cases they have not been recognised as metazoan and are instead labelled as \u2018Incertae sedis\u2019 (e.g., Pl. 1. figs. 14\u201318 and Pl. 2. of Binda et al., 1996). The more recently established concept of \u2018small carbonaceous fossils\u2019 (cf. Butterfield and Harvey, 2012) has drawn attention to previously overlooked metazoan sclerites among palynological preparations, and should prompt a re-examination of the known Acritarcha for other metazoan-derived components.\n\n\n8\nSynchrony\nMacroevolutionary interpretations based on the fossil record must be built up by examining multiple lines of evidence. Organic microfossils represent just one source of information about ancient life, and it is important to compare how this emerging record relates to corresponding patterns seen among other styles of fossil preservation. The fossil record itself represents multiple lines of evidence; organisms can become fossils via a range of fundamentally different taphonomic modes, each of which may be restricted to a particular environment, capture organisms of a certain size, or favour the preservation of entirely different tissue types (Butterfield, 2003). The factors governing one style of preservation (e.g. preservation of shells and skeletal components) may have little in common with \u2018other\u2019 fossil records (such as the evidence from traces and bioturbation; Crimes and Droser, 1992; Buatois and M\u00e1ngano, 2018). All these independent fossil records are ultimately bound by the sedimentary-stratigraphic record (Davies et al., 2020), yet each of these strands represents a unique set of data, with its own idiosyncratic advantages and biases. Integrating these different records and unravelling how they collectively relate to the underlying evolutionary signal is far from straightforward.\nA compilation of patterns from multiple taphonomic modes spanning the Tonian\u2013Cambrian is shown in Fig. 9\n, depicting known evidence for animals from trace fossils, shelly fossils, organic microfossils (this study), and Lagerst\u00e4tten (Fig. 9). Note that evidence for animals from SCFs and trace fossils are embedded within deeper records of organic microfossils and sedimentary structures respectively (Fig. 9). These two taphonomic modes are continuously open for the entire duration of the studied interval.\nImportantly, most of these signals are unidirectional \u2013 in other words, following the first appearance of animal remains, there is a more-or-less continuous fossil record of animal remains captured by these types of preservation for the remainder of the Phanerozoic. The exception to this are records from Lagerst\u00e4tten deposits, which may appear and disappear as taphonomic windows open and close (e.g., BST-Lagerst\u00e4tten). Nevertheless, fossilised animals are absent from all pre-late Ediacaran Lagerst\u00e4tten of any kind, but are present in the vast majority of Lagerst\u00e4tten younger than 580\u00a0Ma.\nIn this light, the synchronicity between these different strands of evidence can be viewed as a multi-proxy signal for the origins of bilaterians, and metazoans more broadly (Fig. 9). Indeed there is no obvious reason why multiple taphonomic windows would record bilaterian emergence and radiation within a relatively short window of time unless it was driven by an underlying evolutionary signal.\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nAcid-extracted organic microfossils feature prominently in accounts of eukaryote evolution (e.g., Porter, 2004b; Javaux and Lepot, 2018), yet they tend to have been overlooked when considering early animal evolution. Macrofossils, with their articulated anatomy and readily identifiable features clearly provide a greater level of information content about the original living organism in comparison to fragmentary and often problematic SCFs. Nevertheless, with their comparative abundance and small particle size, SCFs are better suited for tracking the appearance (and disappearance) of clades (Fig. 6). A useful analogy can be drawn with the fossil record of plants, where the dispersed records of pollen and spores capture a substantially broader spatiotemporal sample of ancient vegetation than that of plant macrofossils. Our survey of 394 existing studies of organic microfossils extracted from half a billion years' worth of strata (from 1\u00a0Ga to 505\u00a0Ma) synthesises previously scattered reports of metazoans, and establishes a baseline for future quantitative analyses. The emerging picture is one where SCFs demonstrably harbour the capacity to expand the known fossil record of numerous animal groups, particularly among non-biomineralizing clades (Fig. 6). In this light, acid-extracted organic microfossils are likely to play an increasingly important role in understanding how, and constraining when, animals first evolved. In summary, we conclude that:\n\n1.\nAnimal remains are frequently detected in studies of organic microfossils (Fig. 5).\n\n\n2.\nAcid-extracted organic microfossils can capture evidence of extinct organisms with a diverse suite of histologies from a comparatively broad range of palaeoenvironments (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.\nKnown instances of metazoan remains among organic microfossils first appear in the late Ediacaran, and subsequently in all Cambrian stages across numerous formations and palaeocontinents (Figs. 4, 5).\n\n\n4.\nThe emergence of metazoans within the archives of organic microfossils constitutes a \u2018record within a record\u2019, and signals a unidirectional trend that emerges within an unbroken taphonomic window that stretches for billions of years.\n\n\n5.\nA compendium of identifiable animal SCFs demonstrates that this style of preservation contains the oldest known records of several major bilaterian clades (Fig. 6).\n\n\n6.\nThe signal of animal origins and diversification seen among organic microfossils is broadly consistent and synchronous with that observed elsewhere in the fossil and sedimentary stratigraphic records (Fig. 9).\n\n\n7.\nIf organic microfossil biotas from before the late Ediacaran are regarded as entirely non-metazoan (containing only various prokaryotes, protists and algae), then collectively, these assemblages could be used to establish an important soft maximum age for the origins of the Metazoa.\n\n\n8.\nDespite the latent potential of organic microfossils to shed light on early animal evolution, we caution that current records are immature in comparison to more developed accountings of ichnofossil and macrofossil remains. In particular, we strongly emphasise that the range of various Cambrian SCF groups are liable to change with continued sampling. We highlight the need for further investigation in undersampled regions (Fig. 4). Additionally, we stress that nomenclature is an important factor for cultivating a search image to develop this record further.\n\n\n\n\n","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe early development of the land biosphere has been affected by landmark events in the evolution and diversification of plants (Tomescu, 2009; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2010; Kenrick et al., 2012; Cleal and Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2014, 2021; Gerrienne et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2018b; Xue et al., 2018; Bowles et al., 2020; Gensel et al., 2020; Puttick et al., 2020). This was notably through the earliest radiation of land plants (embryophytes), from the Middle Ordovician to the early Silurian (~470\u2013430 Ma), the origin and early diversification of vascular plants (tracheophytes), from the middle Silurian to the Middle Devonian (~430\u2013385 Ma), and the expansion of early forests in the Middle to Late Devonian (~390\u2013358 Ma) (Edwards and Davies, 1990; Edwards and Selden, 1992; Edwards et al., 2000; Steemans et al., 2009; Prestianni and Gerrienne, 2010; Wellman, 2010, 2014; Xiong et al., 2013; Edwards et al., 2014; Wellman and Strother, 2015; Strother et al., 2017; Morris et al., 2018a, 2018b; Salamon et al., 2018; Servais et al., 2019; Gensel et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2007, 2012, 2020; Capel et al., 2021; Strother and Foster, 2021).\nPlants colonized the land through a series of distinct phases representing changes in composition and type of vegetation, and an increase in complexity of subaerial ecosystems (see Gerrienne et al., 2016 for details; Fig. 1\n). The Silurian\u2013Devonian plant macrofossil record provides a major resource for assessing the relationship between this process (see Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2016a, 2016b, and references therein), and how it both helped cause and was affected by major environmental changes. For instance, Silurian vegetation consisted of small, simple plants (e.g., Raymond et al., 2006; Wellman et al., 2013; Libert\u00edn et al., 2018; Gensel et al., 2020; Gensel, 2021), which were replaced in the Devonian by floras characterized by an \"explosion\" in morphological disparity (Fig. 1). This Devonian plant radiation, comparable to the \"Cambrian explosion\" of marine faunas (sensu\nBateman et al., 1998), triggered a radical transformation of continental landscapes, from coasts with only localized vegetation to widespread inland forests (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Algeo et al., 2001; Morris et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2015a, 2016, 2018; Shen et al., 2020; Stein et al., 2020). This was the so-called Silurian\u2013Devonian terrestrial revolution, which was crucial for the development of the Earth geo-biosphere, causing major global changes through feedback effects on the evolution of the physical environment, such as major transitions in atmospheric composition and climate (Le Hir et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2015a, 2018; Gerrienne et al., 2016; Qie et al., 2019; Servais et al., 2019; Dahl and Arens, 2020).\nSilurian\u2013earliest Devonian polysporangiophyte diversity mainly consisted of small rhyniophytic plants (Edwards et al., 2014; Morris and Edwards, 2014; Morris et al., 2018a) \u2013 the Eotracheophytic Flora of Cleal and Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana (2021). Subsequently, zosterophyllopsids and basal euphyllophytes began gradually becoming substantial components of Early Devonian floras (Tomescu, 2009; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2014, 2015; Toledo et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018; Bickner and Tomescu, 2019; Fig. 1). In the Middle and Late Devonian, arborescent forms developed in multiple clades, including cladoxylopsids (Stein et al., 2007, 2012; Giesen and Berry, 2013), lycopsids (Gensel and Berry, 2001; Xu et al., 2012; Gerrienne et al., 2018) and progymnosperms (Cressler, 2006; Decombeix et al., 2011; Stein et al., 2020), which triggered the diversification of early forest vegetation (Fig. 1).\nTracheophytes evidently underwent a massive taxonomic radiation during the Devonian, alongside an increase in complexity of tissues, reproductive and photosynthetic organs, including innovations such as leaves, wood and seeds, allowing the progressive colonization of terrestrial environments (Gerrienne et al., 2011; Steemans et al., 2012; Strullu-Derrien et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2015a, 2018; Gerrienne and Gensel, 2016; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2019a; Crepet and Niklas, 2019; Bonacorsi et al., 2020; Niklas and Crepet, 2020). The influence of plant terrestrialization on the physical environment including atmospheric CO2 and O2 levels, climate, and weathering rates, among others (Algeo et al., 1995), further demonstrates the decisive importance of vegetation development to Earth\u2019s landscapes (Kenrick et al., 2012; Lenton et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2016; Dahl and Arens, 2020).\nRecent reinvestigations of collection data (e.g., Gutak et al., 2011; Orlova et al., 2016), revisions and descriptions of numerous different taxa (e.g., Hao and Xue, 2013; Berry and Gensel, 2019; Xu et al., 2020), alongside refined age range constraints and synthetic works (e.g., Wellman et al., 2012, 2013; Xue et al., 2015a, 2018; Barrett, 2016; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2019c; Kraft et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021), now renders it feasible to compile new comprehensive and more detailed datasets of the early land plant macrofossil record (e.g., Capel et al., 2021). However, important uncertainties persist about (i) whether the diversity dynamics of early plants follow comparable trajectories between different major groups, (ii) whether some plant groups were more affected by major environmental change than others, or (iii) whether the uneven sampling of the early plant fossil record hampers accurate reconstructions of these fundamental vegetation dynamics.\nHere, we aim to (1) revisit the global-scale macrofossil-based diversity trajectories and macroevolutionary patterns of Silurian\u2013Devonian floras, (2) reconstruct the early diversity variations within main taxonomic groups, and (3) quantify the impact of sampling bias on the early land plant fossil record. From this, we attempt to provide a revised model of plant diversification in early terrestrial ecosystems.\n\n\n2\nTaxonomic and evolutionary context of Silurian\u2013Devonian floras\nMultiple factors such as homoplasy and the incompleteness of the fossil record have rendered the phylogeny of early land plant groups as still controversial (see e.g., Niklas and Crepet, 2020, and references therein). However, phylogenetic reconstructions using gene sequence data have significantly increased our understanding of plant evolutionary history, despite showing some discrepancies with analyses based on morphological characters (Rothwell and Nixon, 2006; Rothwell et al., 2018). Likewise, numerous cladistic approaches using morphological\/anatomical characters on fossil taxa (e.g., Decombeix et al., 2011; Hao and Xue, 2013; Toledo et al., 2018, 2021; Durieux et al., 2021) or using both extant and fossil taxa (e.g., Rothwell, 1999; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a; Elgorriaga et al., 2018; Crepet and Niklas, 2018, 2019; Niklas and Crepet, 2020) have resulted in phylogenies where the position of certain groups is still controversial (e.g., cladoxylopsids). Further studies will contribute to a better resolution of such groups in the phylogenetic tree. Nevertheless, a phylogenetic framework, which summarizes much consensus and provides the evolutionary context to this study, is presented in Fig. 1.\nThe monophyly of embryophytes is unequivocally accepted, with all extant and extinct land plants most likely sharing a last common ancestor in one of the different lineages of streptophyte algae (Niklas and Kutschera, 2010; Servais et al., 2019). The bryophytes have been identified as either paraphyletic (e.g., Qiu et al., 2006; Chang and Graham, 2011) or monophyletic (e.g., Cox et al., 2014; Puttick et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2018b), within the Embryophyta. All extant vascular plants are polysporangiophytes (i.e., plants with independent branched sporophyte bearing multiple sporangia; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a), which also include non-vascular fossil plants such as the eophytes (Edwards et al., 2022) and the protracheophytes, the latter being represented by Aglaophyton\/Teruelia (Edwards, 1986; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Gerrienne, 2017; Fig. 1). Kenrick and Crane\u2019s (1997a) analysis included the Horneophytopsida within the protracheophytes, although subsequent investigations have suggested the presence of irregular wall thickenings in Horneophyton, resolving Horneophytopsida as a sister clade to the eutracheophytes (i.e., true vascular plants; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2019b; Fig. 1).\nWhilst tracheophytes are considered monophyletic (Gerrienne et al., 2016 and references therein; Puttick et al., 2018), its most basal members lack clear synapomorphies beside their tracheophytic affinity and are referred to as basal eutracheophytes, e.g., Cooksonia (Gonez and Gerrienne, 2010; Libert\u00edn et al., 2018, and references therein). Paratracheophytes (former Rhyniaceae sensu\nKenrick and Crane, 1991) are distinguished from other basal eutracheophytes most notably by their S-type tracheids (Gerrienne et al., 2006), whereas the latter usually possesses C-, G- and P-type tracheids (Edwards, 2003; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2019a; Decombeix et al., 2019; Fig. 1).\nThe two main lineages of eutracheophytes living today, lycophytes and euphyllophytes, are considered monophyletic (Kenrick and Crane, 1997b; Qiu et al., 2006; Crepet and Niklas, 2018, 2019). Lycopsida and Zosterophyllopsida are the two main classes usually recognized in the Lycophytina sensu\nKenrick and Crane (1997a), while the sister-group relationship of these two groups has been questioned by other analyses (Hao and Xue, 2013; Fig. 2\n). Lycopsids are monophyletic, characterized by features including the presence of microphylls, a stellate xylem strand and a close association between sporangia and sporophylls (Gensel and Berry, 2001; Figs. 3\u20134\n\n). Zosterophyllopsids in contrast are leafless and bear reniform sporangia (Banks, 1968; Hueber, 1972; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2014; Fig. 2). Barinophytopsids are an enigmatic group overall characterized by alternatively arranged appendages and sporangia arranged in two rows on a one-sided spike and were probably among the first heterosporous tracheophytes (Bonacorsi et al., 2020, 2021). Different circumscriptions of the Zosterophyllopsida have been put forward: for instance, Kenrick and Crane (1997a) found them paraphyletic to other lycophytes and excluded taxa lacking circinate vernation and showing a helical arrangement of the sporangia but included Barinophytaceae. Nonetheless, Hao and Xue (2013) found zosterophylls to be monophyletic by including taxa bearing their sporangia helically, as we show here (Figs. 1\u20132).\nThe taxa traditionally assigned to trimerophytes, such as Psilophyton and Pertica, and other basal euphyllophytes such as Eophyllophyton and Polythecophyton, are thought to be a complex plexus from which emerged derived clades of euphyllophytes (;Hao and Beck, 1993;; Kenrick and Crane, 1997a;\nTomescu, 2009; Hao and Xue, 2013; Crepet and Niklas, 2019); we thus temporarily assign these basal euphyllophytes into the same \u2018clade\u2019 only for convenience of analyses (Fig. 1). Monilophytes, i.e., modern ferns and horsetails, as well as their fossil relatives, are regarded as the sister group of spermatophytes according to molecular and fossil data (Pryer et al., 2001, 2004; Tomescu, 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Puttick et al., 2018; Figs. 1, 4, 5\n). Devonian monilophytes include cladoxylopsids, sphenopsids, and fern-like groups such as Rhacophytales and Stauropteridales here included within filicophytes. Compared with the basal euphyllophytes, the cladoxylopsids, generally considered as basal fern-like plants, are defined by a more complex vascular system with numerous vascular strands (Meyer-Berthaud and Decombeix, 2007, 2009); a more recent review of this group was presented by Durieux et al. (2021). The position of the sphenopsids, i.e., plants characterized by ribbed stems, small leaves in whorls distributed in stem nodes and internodes, remains unclear (Rothwell, 1999; Tomescu, 2009; Elgorriaga et al., 2018).\nLignophytes are characterized by their bifacial vascular cambium, and encompass both progymnosperms and spermatophytes (Crane, 1985; Steemans et al., 2012; Momont et al., 2016; Decombeix et al., 2019). Progymnosperms (Aneurophytales, Archaeopteridales, Protopityales, and probably Noeggerathiales) are generally considered to be a sister group to seed plants (Crane et al., 2004; Hilton and Bateman, 2006; Niklas and Crepet, 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Figs. 1, 4). The Aneurophytales are homosporous and are assumed to be a sister clade to the heterosporous Archaeopteridales and spermatophytes, although these relationships are not yet resolved (Gerrienne et al., 2010; Toledo et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Spermatophytes are strongly resolved as a monophyletic group (Kenrick and Crane, 1997a, 1997b; Magall\u00f3n and Hilu, 2009; Toledo et al., 2018; Fig. 1). Earliest spermatophytes in the Devonian are generally recognized by the presence of cupulate ovules with an integumented megasporangium containing a single megaspore (Gerrienne et al., 2004; Gerrienne and Meyer-Berthaud, 2007; Wang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017; Fig. 5), but some do not show any cupules (e.g., Guazia; Wang et al., 2022). This clade later greatly diversified and is today\u2019s most important plant lineage.\nTo fully describe the Silurian\u2013Devonian diversity changes, data analysis (see below) was conducted using both phylogenetic and taxonomic criteria, i.e., analyzing macroevolutionary variations from both monophyletic clades and morphological groups. The studied clades include, firstly, lycophytes, and euphyllophytes, and secondly, lycopsids, zosterophyllopsids, as well as monilophytes and lignophytes (Fig. 1). Regarding the considered groups, we tested major class-level categories, which include barinophytopsids, filicopsids, cladoxylopsids, progymnosperms, sphenopsids and spermatopsids (Fig. 1).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nData compilation\nThe analysis described here uses both diversity and sampling data. Diversity data came from the Capel et al. (2021, table S1) plant macrofossil-based compilation, with slight modifications (Table S1). The employed dataset consists of the first and last appearance datum (FAD\u2013LAD) for each plant fossil-genus (sensu\nCleal and Thomas, 2010, 2021) in the interval ranging from Sheinwoodian (middle Silurian) to Famennian (Upper Devonian). The temporal distribution of taxa was tabulated assuming FADs\u2013LADs reflected continuous ranges (i.e., the range-through method; Boltovskoy, 1988). In total, more than 400 fossil-genera were involved which captures a comprehensive overview of major Silurian\u2013Devonian floral changes (see Capel et al., 2021, fig. 1). FADs\u2013LADs were based on maximum observed diversity, i.e., including both genus- and species-level occurrences in open nomenclature (e.g., cf. Tarrantia and Archaeopteris sp., respectively). The resulting temporal ranges showed a high heterogeneity of taxonomic longevities. This is mainly due to the age uncertainties of certain genera, which were tabulated from more than one time bin, even if they occur at just a single locality, e.g., Danziella (Pragian\u2013Emsian; Edwards, 2006) or Parazosterophyllum (Pridoli\u2013Pragian; McSweeney et al., 2020). As noted by Brocklehurst et al. (2013), however, if the stratigraphical uncertainties are randomly distributed, the diversity signal is reliable and is preferable to attempting to improve resolution and possibly producing an artificial signal (see e.g., Smith, 2001, and reference therein).\nWe prioritized the use of fossil-genera rather than the species-level for plant diversity studies. This is because species data are more sensitive to floristic variations due to the number of synonyms, endemicity and the uncertainties of some identifications based on highly fragmentary specimens, which could artificially inflate plant diversity (Knoll et al., 1984; Silvestro et al., 2015; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2016). Another issue stems from the distinctive nature of plant fossil taxonomy, in which different parts of one plant (e.g., leaves and\/or reproductive organs) can belong to different fossil-species, and this will distort the species diversity signal (Cleal and Thomas, 2010, 2021; Cleal et al., 2021, and references therein). It is known that these inflation-related problems may also occur at the generic rank, but this taxonomic level seems to be less sensitive to these biases (Knoll et al., 1984; Wang et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2013). To minimize these biases, \u201cartificial fossil-genera\u201d (sensu\nCleal and Thomas, 2021), synonyms, and gametophytes were excluded, and known plants representing the same palaeobiological entity were linked (e.g., Calamophyton\/Duisbergia, Giesen and Berry, 2013), to get the most accurate representation of plant diversity dynamics. Each entry in the dataset consists of a genus name, biological affinity, stratigraphical age, and outcrop location (Table S1). Importantly, while some taxa have a highly detailed temporal assignation (e.g., Gutak et al., 2011), others present a less precise resolution (e.g., Prestianni et al., 2012). Hence, in an attemto to minimize overestimating plant diversity, FADs\u2013LADs were traced at the stage and sub-stage levels according to temporal resolution given by original data sources (Table S1, Text S1). Absolute ages are according to the International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2020 (v2020\/03; Cohen et al., 2013, updated).\nIt is well-documented that fossil-derived diversity patterns can be influenced by a series of biases including both geological constraints (e.g., availability of fossiliferous outcrops), and collecting factors (e.g., variation in sampling effort) (Crampton et al., 2003; Smith and McGowan, 2007; Barrett et al., 2009; Brocklehurst et al., 2013; Dunhill et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2018; Walker et al., 2017a). Indeed, since Raup (1972) first observed an apparent correlation between Phanerozoic marine diversity and the fluctuations in the volume of sedimentary rock, many researchers have put emphasis on discerning the reliability of the fossil record when studying changes of past diversity over time (see e.g., Smith et al., 2012; Benton, 2015, and references therein). From this, several ways to assess, and compensate for this problem, have been tested using the so-called sampling proxies, i.e., a metric representing \u201ccollecting effort\u201d (Benton et al., 2011). It is generally agreed that a good sampling proxy must consider all aspects of collecting data that are influenced by geological and anthropogenic factors, and ideally should be independent of the palaeobiodiversity signal it is seeking to correct (Benton et al., 2011; Dunhill, 2011). However, an ongoing debate still exists about what is the most appropriate sampling proxy (see discussion below). For instance, recent studies claim that the strong observed association between formation counts and raw diversity is mainly due to information redundancy (see e.g., Dunhill et al., 2018, and references therein). In this study, we have attempted to reduce this and other related problems by using the plant-bearing fossil localities per time unit as a measure of sampling effort through time. Locality compilation, which is based on species occurrences within each genus range, provides direct insights into sampling and is, therefore, a reliable basis for developing integrated model-based approaches (e.g., Lloyd et al., 2008; Benton et al., 2011; Butler et al., 2011; Fr\u00f6bisch, 2013; Xiong et al., 2013; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2014, 2015; Brown et al., 2019). The locality list is given in Table S2. Raw diversity and sampling data are also available on request.\n\n\n3.2\nProcessing methods\n\n3.2.1\nTemporal patterns of diversification\nTo characterize the observed diversity dynamics (i.e., the apparent diversity changes taken at face value from the fossil record; Foote, 2001) of Silurian\u2013Devonian tracheophytes, we firstly calculated the total and standing diversity per time unit. Total diversity (N\ntot) is the total number of plant genera within a given time interval, which can be used as a first descriptor of encountered diversity. Following Foote (2000a), N\ntot was calculated by:\n\n(1)\n\n\nN\ntot\n\n=\n\nN\nFL\n\n+\n\nN\nbL\n\n+\n\nN\nFt\n\n+\n\nN\nbt\n\n\n\nwhere for a given time interval t\n\ni\n, N\nFL is the number of single-interval taxa (i.e., taxa whose FAD and LAD are both within the interval t\n\ni\n), N\nbL is the number of bottom-only boundary crossers (i.e., taxa crossing the lower boundary of interval t\n\ni\n and become extinct during that interval),\nN\nFt is the number of top-only boundary crossers (i.e., taxa that make their FAD during the interval t\n\ni\n and cross the upper boundary of that interval) and N\nbt is the number of taxa ranging through the entire interval t\n\ni\n (i.e., crossing both the lower and upper boundaries of the interval).\nWe also traced the boundary-crossing diversity (N\nb), which is the only measure of actual standing diversity that allows a comparison of the diversity at the start of different intervals (Bambach et al., 2004). N\nb is based on the equation (Foote, 2000a, table 1):\n\n(2)\n\n\nN\nb\n\n=\n\nN\nbL\n\n+\n\nN\nbt\n\n\n\n\n\nWe further calculated the mean-standing diversity (MSD), which estimates the diversity at a specific point of time. MSD corresponds to the equation (Foote, 2000a, table 1):\n\n(3)\n\nMSD\n=\n\n\n\nN\nbL\n\n+\n\nN\nFt\n\n+\n2\n\n\nN\nbt\n\n\n\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\nThe dynamics of floral changes were evaluated from a set of evolutionary metrics using both per-taxon rates and boundary-crosser method (Foote, 2000a; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2013; Warnock et al., 2020). We calculated the per-taxon and per-capita origination (\u03bb) and extinction (\u03bc) rate measures as descriptors of diversity changes. Per-taxon rates are based on the FADs-LADs proportions observed during a given interval t\n\ni\n, according to the equations (Foote, 2000a, table 1):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03bb\n=\n\n\n\nN\nFL\n\n+\n\nN\nFt\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\nN\ntot\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n1\n\/\n\u0394\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\u03bc\n=\n\n\n\nN\nFL\n\n+\n\nN\nbL\n\n\n\n\/\n\nN\ntot\n\n)\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n1\n\/\n\u0394\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n\n\nPer-taxon rates normalize observed FADs-LADs by total diversity and by the interval length (\u0394t\n\ni\n) to obtain an estimate of the instantaneous, origination-extinction rates per lineage-million-years (Foote, 2000a). In contrast, per-capita rates, are based on the following equations (Foote, 2000a, table 1), which are directly derived from Raup\u2019s (1985) branching theory:\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bb\n=\n\u2212\nln\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nbt\n\n\/\n\nN\nFt\n\n+\n\nN\nbt\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n1\n\/\n\u0394\n\nt\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\u03bc\n=\n\u2212\nln\n\n\n\n\n\nN\nbt\n\n\/\n\nN\nbL\n\n+\n\nN\nbt\n\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n1\n\/\n\u0394\n\nt\ni\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nPer-capita rates are singleton-free metrics based on the assumption that the number of lineages extending through the interval depends only on the taxonomic rates for such an interval and provides a true rate regardless of the origination-extinction magnitude (Foote, 2000a). To complement this, the amount of change in floral composition was evaluated via per-capita turnover rates expressed by \u03bb + \u03bc.\n\nSepkoski (1978, 1979, 1984) kinetic model predicted that Phanerozoic marine diversity changes were controlled by the balance between origination and extinction. This model also postulated that diversification rate is diversity dependent. In plants, Knoll et al. (1984) used these assumptions to explain the early phase of Silurian\u2013Devonian plant diversification by plotting total origination-extinction rates against diversity per time unit. Here, we revisit Knoll et al.\u2019s (1984) approach by comparing change in origination-extinction per-taxon and per-capita rates against total and boundary-crossing standing diversity per time unit, respectively (see Foote, 2000b, figs. 1\u20132 for details). This double check attempts to compensate for the Lagerst\u00e4tten effect on global diversity trends, which, in some intervals (e.g., Pragian, see Hao and Xue, 2013; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2015), is caused by a high proportion of single-interval (and endemic) taxa. Following Benton et al. (2013), correlation between variables was evaluated via Spearman\u2019s rank correlation tests to determine whether any substantial correlation revealed could explain the observed variance.\n\nNiklas et al. (1983) argued that a high degree of correlation exists between origination rates and plant longevities. They further commented that the initial diversification of successive floras is characterized by high origination rates but short taxon longevities. This idea was originally tested by contrasting the mean of origination rates and taxa duration among major plant groups through the Phanerozoic (see Niklas et al., 1983, fig. 2). However, when the algorithm used was described, they referred to diversification rates instead of origination metrics, as well as sometimes to summed versus averaged rates. Hence, to test Niklas et al.\u2019s (1983) assumptions on the early land plant fossil record, we plotted both the per-taxon origination and diversification rates, i.e., the net rate of increase between origination and extinction values, against mean taxon longevity. Also, in both cases, the mean and summed rate values were tested. Correlation was again evaluated via Spearman\u2019s rank correlation tests.\nFinally, as biostratigraphic data are by essence occurrences collated into chronostratigraphic units of unknown and unequal duration, we tested the impact of using \"unequal time bins\" on the resulting patterns. This was done by applying the method described by Gibert and Escarguel (2017), which allow reconstructed diversity curves to be obtained from intervals of equal duration. In our case, we computed a total diversity curve based on equal time bins of 3.1 Myr, value corresponding to the mean duration of used interval lengths. In addition, to investigate whether uneven time-bin length distorts the observed diversity signal, the correlation between raw diversity and time-bin length was also tested by Spearman rank correlation.\n\n\n3.2.2\nSampling intensity and corrected diversity estimates\nWe plotted total and standing diversity data against a sampling signal (i.e., the number of sampled localities per time unit) and evaluated the fit between them. We followed the identical strategy adopted by Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud (2015) and used Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficients, and Spearman\u2019s and Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficients that provide complementary views of the major data variations through time. Pearson's coefficient measures the strength of a correlation between two variables, while Spearman's and Kendall\u2019s measures whether peaks and troughs follow comparable trajectories (Fr\u00f6bisch, 2013). To avoid inconsistencies of false positives we ran a two-time data analysis from raw and generalized-differenced (detrended) data for comparisons, which removes general background trends caused by autocorrelation (McKinney, 1990; Benson and Butler, 2011). Transformed data were obtained via Lloyd's \u2018functions_2.r\u2019 script (see http:\/\/www.graemetlloyd.com\/methgd.html) in R (R Core Team, 2020; v.3.6.3), which has been used in many previous similar studies (e.g., Lloyd et al., 2011; Dunhill et al., 2012; Benton et al., 2013; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2016). P-values lower than 0.05 were considered as significant.\nTo correct diversity estimates, we applied Lloyd\u2019s (2012) implementation of the Smith and McGowan (2007) method, which has been widely used for evaluating sampling impact on apparent diversity (e.g., Mannion et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2012; Brocklehurst et al., 2013; Fr\u00f6bisch, 2013; Walter and Fr\u00f6bisch, 2013; Newham et al., 2014; Minter et al., 2017). The Smith and McGowan (2007) method was developed to remove potential bias caused by variations in rock-availability for sampling per time interval, by calculating modelled (or predicted) diversity estimates assuming a linear relationship between apparent diversity and a correction measure. From this, the predicted diversity (i.e., the diversity correlated to sampling) is then subtracted from the apparent diversity, leaving the residual, or sampling-corrected diversity estimate. Lloyd (2012) refined this method by avoiding the assumption of a linear relationship between diversity and sampling proxy. Prior to calculation of the predicted values of diversity, the most appropriate model is chosen by following the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Johnson and Omland, 2004). But most importantly, Lloyd\u2019s (2012) method further allows extending confidence intervals around the data to identify diversity fluctuations that are significantly greater and\/or lower than those predicted from the sampling proxy, and so have a potential biological explanation beyond rock record noise. See http:\/\/www.graemetlloyd.com\/methscd.html for analysis implementation.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nTaxonomic diversity estimates\nLarge-scale diversity patterns of Silurian\u2013Devonian tracheophytes, including dynamics of major taxonomic groups, are shown in Figs. 6\u20138\n\n\n. From this, we see that the total diversity of tracheophytes increases steadily from the Ludlow (late Silurian) to the Lochkovian (earliest Devonian) (Fig. 6), caused mainly by increases in the lycophytes (Fig. 7A), notably basal lycopsids (Fig. 7B) and zosterophyllopsids (Fig. 7C). Thereafter, taxonomic diversity reached a brief plateau during the Lochkovian (Fig. 6), likely due to the stratigraphically-constrained occurrences of basal eutracheophytes and rhyniophytoid taxa. A subsequent, \u201cexplosive\u201d peak is seen at the end-Pragian, mainly because of high zosterophyllopsid and barinophytopsid diversities (Figs. 7C, 8A), and to a lesser extent, a minor lycopsid diversity peak (Fig. 7B). Subsequently, tracheophyte diversity begins to decline in the Emsian, followed by a minor increment towards the end of the Early Devonian (Fig. 6) caused by lycopsids and basal euphyllophytes (Fig. 7A\u2013B, D).\nThe Middle Devonian trends of tracheophyte diversity are characterized by a drastic reduction at the base of the Eifelian (earliest Middle Devonian; Fig. 6). This is principally due to a strong decline in zosterophyllopsids (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the Eifelian diversity of tracheophytes reaches levels not seen since Lochkovian times (Fig. 6). After that, a second diversity peak is observed during the Givetian (late Middle Devonian) (Fig. 6), triggered by an important pulse of both lycophyte (Fig. 7A) and euphyllophyte diversity (Fig. 7D). More specifically, the Givetian diversification involves lycopsids (Fig. 7B), and almost all major groups of monilophytes (Fig. 7E), such as filicopsids (Fig. 8B) and especially cladoxylopsids (Fig. 8C), as well as lignophytes, notably progymnosperms (Fig. 8D).\nThis second maximum peak of diversity is followed by an important depletion in the Frasnian (Late Devonian), mainly linked to a reduction of cladoxylopsid and progymnosperm taxa (Fig. 8C\u2013D). Tracheophyte diversity steadily increases again throughout the Famennian (latest Devonian), where the highest values are observed (Fig. 6), triggered mainly by a diversification of lycophytes (Fig. 7A), euphyllophytes (Fig. 7D) and lignophytes (Fig. 7F). It is further sustained by the diversity increase of sphenopsids (Fig. 8E), and spermatopsids (Fig. 8F), and results in an overall exponential increase in diversity.\nThe N\nb and MSD metrics follow the same trends as total diversity (Fig. 6), which suggests that the observed apparent pattern is not critically distorted by single-interval taxa. Perhaps, the most notable difference is in the boundary-crossing diversity during the Late Devonian (Fig. 6), which shows some discrepancies from the observed MSD changes (Fig. 6); indeed, the MSD pattern does not capture a late Frasnian diversity peak recorded in boundary-crossing fluctuations (Fig. 6). This discrepancy is also seen in the diversity curves for each of the major clades (Fig. 7A, D), and is probably due to the succession of longer time units in the Late Devonian. Moreover, the fact that the MSD pattern displays similar variations to the other two metrics (Total and N\nb), within individual clades (Fig. 7), and in each different plant group (Fig. 8) highlights the robustness of these apparent diversity signals.\nData analysis based on equal time bins did not show major differences concerning the total pattern of apparent diversity shown in Fig. 6 (Fig. S1A). Likewise, results show that there is no significant correlation between the plant richness and used interval lengths (rho = 0.03, p > 0.05; Fig. S1B).\n\n\n4.2\nOrigination, extinction, and turnover rates\n\nFig. 9\n shows some of the broad macroevolutionary trends in tracheophytes during the Silurian\u2013Devonian. Highest origination values are observed from the Silurian to the Early Devonian with notable peaks in the Pridoli, and at the beginning of the Lochkovian and of the Pragian (Fig. 9A). After that, an important origination pulse occurs at the base of the Givetian (Middle Devonian) (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the extinction pattern shows highest values at the end-Pragian and the end-Givetian (Fig. 9B). There are no major differences observed between per-taxon and per-capita rate measures for originations or extinctions (Fig. 9A\u2013B), showing that single-interval taxa and unequal time units were having little impact.\nFor taxonomic turnover, the difference between per-taxon and per-capita rates is small and they generally follow similar trajectories. However, while per-taxon pattern shows no major fluctuation through the Silurian\u2013Devonian transition, per-capita values show a series of turnover peaks in the Pridoli and the Lochkovian (Fig. 9C). After that, highest turnover pulses are observed in the Pragian and the Givetian (Fig. 9C), indicating an important amount of change in floristic composition during these intervals.\nWithin clades and groups (Figs. 10\u201311\n\n), Early Devonian origination-extinction pulses are shared by the major clades then existing. For instance, highest origination-extinction values are observed in the Pragian from lycophytes (Fig. 10A\u2013B), including lycopsids (Fig. 10D\u2013E), zosterophyllopsids (Fig. 10G\u2013H), and barinophytopsids (Fig. 11A\u2013B), as well as from basal euphyllophytes (Fig. 10J\u2013K). Likewise, Middle Devonian (Givetian) origination-extinction peaks are shared by all tested clades, including monilophytes (Fig. 10M\u2013N), filicopsids (Fig. 11D\u2013E), cladoxylopsids (Fig. 11H) and sphenopsids (Fig. 11M\u2013N), as well as lignophytes (Fig. 10P\u2013Q), such as progymnosperms (Fig. 11J\u2013K). Results further show an isolated origination increment driven by Middle Devonian (Eifelian) cladoxylopsids (Fig. 11G). Moreover, the turnover rate shows two major pulses: one in the Pragian mainly concerning lycophytes (Figs. 10C, 10F, 10I, 11C), and a second one in the Givetian involving euphyllophytes (Figs. 10\u201311L, 10\u201311O, 10R, 11F, 11I). Finally, evolutionary patterns of spermatopsids show a clear diversification towards the end of the Devonian (Fig. 11P\u2013R).\n\nFig. 12\n shows the relationships between the changes in total and boundary-crossing diversity and origination-extinction values for all Silurian\u2013Devonian vascular plants. It is known that diversity is controlled by the balance of origination and extinction rates (Sepkoski, 1978, 1979, 1984; Knoll et al., 1984; Foote, 2000a, 2000b; Bambach et al., 2004; Alroy, 2008, 2010a, 2010b; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Cleal, 2012). Foote (2000b) commented that larger increases in origination rate tend to be associated with larger increases in diversity, and larger decreases in origination rate with larger decreases in diversity. Likewise, larger increases in extinction rate are associated with larger reductions in diversity, and larger decreases in extinction rate with larger rises in diversity. We find partial correlations between changes in origination-extinction levels and total diversity values (Fig. 12A\u2013B). But importantly, results show significant correlation values in both cases from standing metrics (Fig. 12C\u2013D). Results further show stronger correlation levels between changes in extinction values and changes in diversity (rho = -0.60, p < 0.01; Fig. 12D), which suggests that for Silurian\u2013Devonian floras, variations in extinction rate may be more important than variations in origination rate to explain short-term fluctuations in the apparent dynamics of plant diversity.\nIn plants, it has been suggested that the overall patterns of increasing origination rates and decreasing observed longevities between major groups are significantly correlated (Niklas et al., 1983). However, we find no correlation between the mean origination and longevity at the genus-level for the tested Silurian\u2013Devonian plant groups (rho = -0.15, p > 0.05; Fig. 13A), probably due to the high volatility observed both within and among groups (Fig. S2). In contrast, results show significant correlation between diversification rates and observed longevity of each group (rho = 0.69, p < 0.05; Fig. 13B), which would support the key role of extinction patterns on observed turnover dynamics (Figs. 10\u201311). Complementary analysis based on summed origination and diversification rate values provided identical results (Fig. S3).\n\n\n4.3\nSampling bias and corrected diversity estimates\nIt would seem reasonable that increases in sampling intensity would increase apparent diversity both within floral assemblages and within stratigraphical intervals. Fig. 6 plots the number of sampled localities per time unit and confirms that high diversity values tend to be associated with high sampling intensities (e.g., in the Givetian) and diversity declines with reduced sampling intensities (e.g., in the Emsian). For that reason, it is not surprising that fewer plant genera are registered through the Early\u2013Middle Devonian transition, because fewer sampled localities are recognized in that interval compared with previous time intervals (Table S2, Text S1). A regression analysis shows significant positive correlations between the observed number of plant macrofossil taxa (both raw and detrended data) and the number of localities (Fig. 14A\u2013B). However, MSD is only significantly correlated with site numbers when raw MSD data are used (Fig. 14C\u2013D), suggesting that MSD is less sensitive to bias by sampling intensity than total diversity and so provides a better picture of Silurian\u2013Devonian plant diversity dynamics.\n\nFig. 15\n compares observed and predicted patterns of Silurian\u2013Devonian diversity of tracheophytes. There is a similarity between patterns from both the total diversity and MSD patterns, except that latter tends to be a little smoother (Fig. 15A\u2013B). The residual differences between these observed and predicted data were used to plot the sampling-corrected curves for observed diversity and MSD shown in Fig. 15C\u2013D. These sampling-corrected data mainly fall within the 95% confidence interval suggesting that the trends are mainly being driven by sampling (Fig. 15C\u2013D); this seems to be particularly so for the Silurian\u2013early Lochkovian diversity data. However, there are significant positive excursions in the observed residual observed (raw) data during the Early Devonian (Lochkovian and Pragian) and negative excursions in the Middle Devonian (Eifelian), and at the end-Givetian (Fig. 15C), which are likely to have biological (rather than sampling) causes. The MSD residuals data follow a broadly similar pattern except for additional positive excursions in the middle Emsian and middle Givetian (Fig. 15D).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nApparent patterns of early plant diversity\nEarly work on land plant diversification (Niklas et al., 1980, 1983, 1985; Knoll et al., 1984; Niklas, 1988; Niklas and Tiffney, 1994) based on the macrofossil record suggested diversity followed a general increasing trend in the late Silurian and Early Devonian, until it reached a plateau in the Middle to Late Devonian. This pattern has remained the accepted paradigm over subsequent decades (see e.g., Hilton et al., 2003; Gutak et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2015a). However, these models were based on plant fossil compilations using the data then available, which included relatively small numbers of taxa, and where the age-estimations were often inaccurate. In addition, the early studies were not global in scope as they were mainly restricted to the western Europe and North America fossil records (Raymond and Metz, 1995).\nThe numerous taxonomic description and revisions in the recent past, coupled with an increased interest in assemblages in Gondwana (e.g., Prestianni et al., 2012; Moisan et al., 2011; Meyer-Berthaud et al., 2003, 2016c; Berry et al., 2000; Berry and Gensel, 2019) and South China (see Xue et al., 2018 for a review), have now provided us with a much-improved dataset on which to re-investigate early land plant diversification. A re-evaluation of global Silurian\u2013Mississippian macrofossil plant diversity by Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al. (2016), using similar diversity metrics to the ones employed in this study, demonstrated that the observed pattern is in fact more nuanced than previously thought, with apparent diversity peaks being manifest in the Pragian and Givetian, as well as a noticeable depletion event in the Eifelian.\nAlthough our results (Fig. 6) are qualitatively similar, there are differences because of the use of a finer stratigraphical resolution, which provides better temporal constraints of diversity fluctuations. For instance, results show a late Emsian peak of total diversity (Fig. 6), instead of a general reduction of diversity throughout the Emsian as a whole (Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2016, fig. 1). Previous lycopsid and euphyllophyte diversity patterns (Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2016, fig. 3) present an almost continuous growth from their appearance to the Mississippian, without any noticeable peaks really standing out. Our results have shown that the steady growth in apparent diversity is punctuated by pronounced peaks, discernible in both the overall diversity (Fig. 6) and the diversity in the two main monophyletic clades (Fig. 7A, D).\nThere have also been several global studies of Silurian\u2013Devonian palynological diversity to complement the work on the macrofossil record (Chaloner, 1967; Knoll et al., 1984; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2016). Because of their high preservation potential, and high rates of production and dispersal (Wellman and Gray, 2000; Wellman et al., 2013), the spore record could be regarded as a more reliable indicator of past plant diversity, being less affected by preservation and geological biases than macrofloras. Indeed, spores are vastly more abundant and preserved in more sediment types than early plant macrofossils. This is especially so in the early Ordovician\u2013Silurian history of land plants where macrofossils are exceptionally rare (Wellman et al., 2003, 2013; Salamon et al., 2018; Servais et al., 2019, fig. 2). However, multiple factors tend to inflate spore taxic diversity and the biological affinities of many of the dispersed spore taxa are unknown. It also distorts the relative representation of the different plant groups. Furthermore, several spore-taxa have been recovered from the same sporangium and, conversely, the same spore taxa can be found in sporangia of different plant species, genera or even clades (e.g., Allen, 1980; Gensel, 1980; Edwards and Richardson, 1996; Bek, 2017). Interpretation of vegetational changes using spores therefore requires caution (Cleal et al., 2021; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2022, tables 2\u20133). Global spore diversity continuously increases through the Devonian, but with no identifiable peaks (Knoll et al., 1984; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2016). On a more regional scale, palynological diversities have been shown to have similar trajectories to that seen in the macrofossil record, such as in South China (Xiong et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2020), indicating that both records have been subject to similar underlying controls and biases. However, it seems that the real strength of palynology in diversity studies will be at a landscape or local scale, where many of these distorting effects are less pronounced (Cleal et al., 2021).\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in the regional variation in Silurian\u2013Devonian vegetation diversity patterns. If sampling is homogeneous, regional patterns might be expected to reflect global diversity fluctuations over time (Alroy, 2003). For instance, Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud (2015) showed there to be remarkable similarities in the diversity patterns of Zosterophyllopsida from different palaeogeographical regions. In other cases, however, regional variations in diversity patterns have been identified. In Laurussia (North America, Europe, the Russian platform) the evidence suggests a continuous increase from the late Silurian to the Emsian, followed by an overall decrease from the Eifelian to the middle Famennian, and then another increase in the late Famennian (Raymond and Metz, 1995). More recent work on eastern Euramerica (USA, Canada, northern Europe, western Russia; Lu et al., 2021) suggested a period of diversification in the Early to Middle Devonian, followed by two noticeable peaks in the Givetian and the Famennian, separated by a strong Frasnian trough. Overall, these results are broadly like the pattern observed here (Fig. 6). In contrast, in Siberia (Gutak et al., 2011) and northern Russia (Orlova et al., 2016), significant peaks in vegetation diversity have been reported in the Frasnian and early Famennian, whereas in South China diversity peaks occurred in the Pragian, Givetian and Famennian (Wang et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2018). These differences may be partly reflecting sampling and geological biases inherent in such studies. Alternatively, however, it may be reflecting the provincialism that has been previously suggested to have existed with Devonian floras (Raymond et al., 1985, 2006; Raymond, 1987; Edwards, 1990; Edwards and Berry, 1991; Hao and Xue, 2013).\n\n\n5.2\nSampling bias and geological constraints on the early plant fossil record\nA significant correlation has been found between the number of fossil plant-bearing localities and raw diversity counts, and so predicted and observed diversity patterns display striking similarities (Fig. 15A\u2013B). However, while at first glance, Silurian\u2013Devonian plant diversity patterns could appear essentially the result of sampling bias, the number of localities may co-vary with abundance and diversity, and so diversity may not be just a response to heterogenous sampling or lack of fossiliferous localities. This is particularly true for the earliest record of plant macrofossils in the Silurian, as plants were not as widespread as they were later in the Devonian; the low number of localities in fact probably reflects actual low plant abundance and diversity of the vegetation, implying a redundancy effect. In our view, although impacted by sampling bias (Fig. 15C\u2013D), the concomitant increase of diversity and number of localities between the middle Silurian and the middle Early Devonian (Fig. 6) probably also reflects the progressive colonisation of the land by plants (Le Hir et al., 2011; Davies et al., 2021; Gensel et al., 2020). In fact, the higher-than-expected diversities at the Lochkovian and Pragian suggest more of a diversification signal than a sampling driven pattern (Fig. 15C\u2013D). Furthermore, the observed diversity peaks in the Pragian and the Givetian (Figs. 6 and 15B) are also probably a true diversification, as is the observed depletion in diversity at the Eifelian. These findings corroborate the first estimations of sampling biases on early land plant diversity in Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud (2014, 2015) using the zosterophyllopsid fossil record.\nSo far, sampling biases in the palaeobotanical record have been scarcely evaluated (Cleal et al., 2021; Pardoe et al., 2021). With Lloyd\u2019s (2012) method, the difficulty resides in properly assessing which proxy may be used to standardise the amount of diversity found within each time unit. For instance, many studies have used outcrop or exposure area as a proxy to capture the amount of rock accessible for sampling to correct for sampling biases (e.g., Crampton et al., 2003; Smith and McGowan, 2007; Smith et al., 2012). However, more than one type of sampling bias can affect a raw diversity curve and the effects of those biases may be widely different between clades (Benton et al., 2013). The availability of such proxies is also often lacking (e.g., for palaeobotanical studies, there are no global compilations of outcrop area or rock volume or terrestrial sedimentary deposits). The choice of locality counts as a proxy, as used here, is based on the following logic: as more localities are discovered, more effort is put into sampling, which enhances collection levels, and hence, observed diversity. However, if sampling effort is homogenous and extensive, locality counts may themselves be controlled by other larger biases linked to the quality and amount of fossiliferous sedimentary rocks available from different ages (Smith and McGowan, 2011; Dunhill et al., 2014a, 2014b; Walker et al., 2017b).\nIt has been suggested that marine diversity patterns through time have been controlled by tectonics and changing sea-level \u2013 the so-called \u2018common-cause\u2019 (CC) hypothesis (Peters, 2005; Smith and McGowan, 2011; Smith and Benson, 2013; Zaffos et al., 2017; Close et al., 2018). Analogous cycles of transgression and regressions may also have affected the diversity observed in the plant fossil record, which is naturally skewed towards lowland rather than upland vegetation: uplands are generally erosional, and not depositional environments (Thomas and Cleal, 2017; Cleal and Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana, 2019), and there are no unequivocal examples of preserved in situ upland vegetation until the Carboniferous, and are in fact generally rare throughout the Phanerozoic (Falcon-Lang, 2003; Boyce and Lee, 2017).\nRecently, Kocsis and Scotese (2020) estimated the amount of continental flooding over the course of the Phanerozoic to provide a proxy for the extent of terrestrial lowland areas available for vegetation. If the CC hypothesis can equally be applied to plants, then we should observe a negative correlation with the amount of continental flooding. Such a correlation is apparent in the late Silurian, Early Devonian and Late Devonian, but not during the Middle Devonian (Fig. 16A\u2013B). This might suggest that during the Early Devonian, the increase in available paralic habitats during regressive phases may have been helping drive the diversification of the early terrestrial vegetation but, by the Middle Devonian, plants had evolved adaptive strategies to take advantage of most of those habitats and so diversification declined. The Givetian plant diversification, coinciding with an overall increase in transgressive flooding, is less easy to explain, unless habitat fragmentation in the lowlands was raising selection pressure that raised diversification. Although other biases such as sampling effort may be affecting diversity in the macrofloral record over relatively short stratigraphical intervals such as stages, CC-like effects were probably more influential for explaining the diversity dynamics over longer time scales (Smith and McGowan, 2011).\n\u201cMolecular clock\u201d data suggest that tracheophytes appeared in the early Silurian or perhaps, even the Late Ordovician (Morris et al., 2018b). Several hypotheses have been invoked to explain the lack of tracheophyte macrofossils before the middle Silurian and their paucity in the upper Silurian (e.g., Gensel, 2008; Decombeix et al., 2019). For instance, plants may not have been growing in environments that would allow them to be effectively transported into appropriate depositional basins (Wellman, 2004). The lack of degradation-resistant tissues in early land plants except for spores has also been suggested as a major factor (Strother et al., 1996; Kenrick et al., 2012). Servais et al. (2019) pointed out that there is a progressive change in the fossil record of plants through the Late Ordovician and Silurian from isolated cryptospores, to isolated sporangia, to sporangia borne on increasingly long axes. This suggests that only the spore-bearing organs of these early plants were initially being subaerially exposed but that this exposure was being progressively increased to facilitate improved spore dispersal. Since only these spore-bearing structures would have adaptive features to survive drying in subaerial conditions, these will be the only parts of the very early plants that would survive fossilisation. It was only in the late Silurian and Early Devonian that plants became adapted to a fully (or mostly) subaerial life and therefore had a reasonably high preservation potential.\nAnother commonly invoked reason for the poor pre-Devonian macroflora record is the apparent lack of terrestrial deposits (e.g., Kenrick and Crane, 1997a, 1997b; Kenrick et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2018b). Whilst Devonian plant macrofossils are mainly found in lowland terrestrial deposits (e.g., Edwards and Richardson, 2004; Kennedy et al., 2012), Silurian plant macrofossils are all allochthonous remains found in marine sediments (Raymond et al., 2006; Wellman et al., 2013). The extensive continental flooding that evidently took place during the Silurian (Fig. 16B) may, therefore, also help explain the paucity of Silurian plant macrofossils (Kenrick et al., 2012).\nAnother significant factor that may affect measures of plant fossil diversity is post-depositional erosion of terrestrial sedimentary deposits (Smith, 2007; Smith et al., 2012), which may have particularly affected the types of strata in which macrofloras typically occur. Knoll et al. (1979) already showed that the extent of terrestrial outcrop area through time is strongly correlated with the amount of plant fossil-taxa described from North America, and Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al. (2013) found similar correlations at a global scale using the total sedimentary rock record. Another example is in South China, where the lack of terrestrial Emsian\u2013Eifelian deposits, linked to a regional transgression, may explain the near absence of plant fossils of this age here (Hao and Xue, 2013; Xiong et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2018).\n\n\n5.3\nBiosphere dynamics and early land plant diversification\nThe impact of the development of terrestrial vegetation on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and consequently on climate, has been extensively discussed (e.g., Berner, 1997, 2005; Algeo et al., 1995, 2001; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Berner and Kothavala, 2001; Beerling, 2007; Strother et al., 2010; Lenton et al., 2012; Ibarra et al., 2019; Dahl and Arens, 2020, Chen et al., 2021). Increasing carbon sequestration due to the evolution of larger plants and enhanced silicate weathering rates caused by plant roots have been invoked as the main reasons for falling CO2 levels and a cooling climate during the Devonian (Berner, 1997; Simon et al., 2007; Algeo and Scheckler, 2010; Le Hir et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2017; Brugger et al., 2019;\nFig. 16C). Furthermore, the observed taxonomic diversification of the macrofloras indicates that plants were becoming adapted to growing in a wider range of habitats, thereby increasing vegetation cover. This increase in vegetation cover may also have reduced the planet\u2019s albedo and so increased global temperatures, especially during the Late Devonian (Le Hir et al., 2011), although the effects of this may have been overestimated (Brugger et al., 2019).\nCarbon sequestration due to the general increase in plant biomass during the Devonian might be expected to produce higher levels of atmospheric O2 (Strother et al., 2010; Lenton et al., 2012; Elrick et al., 2022). The GEOCARBSULF model (Berner, 2006, 2009; Royer et al., 2014) has predicted remarkably high atmospheric O2 levels already in the Silurian (Schachat et al., 2018; Fig. 16D) and this could have been linked to increased phytoplankton primary production, and\/or an earlier terrestrialization of plants suggested by the microfossil record (Strother et al., 2010; Lenton et al., 2012; Servais et al., 2019). However, O2 levels in fact reportedly fell during the Devonian (Fig. 16D) and appears to have been unaffected by the expansion of plant diversity at this time.\nGlobal temperatures have been a major influence on Phanerozoic global diversity trajectories in both marine faunas (Erwin, 2009; Mayhew et al., 2008, 2012) and terrestrial floras (e.g., DiMichele et al., 2001; McElwain et al., 2007; Heimhofer et al., 2018; Slater et al., 2019). The palaeobotanical record suggests that there were major floral turnovers during global warming and cooling events, with significant selective adaptations or extinctions of clades when migration was unable to mitigate the effects of ecological pressures (Knoll and Niklas, 1987). Overall, however, the evidence of climate having affected early land plant diversification is equivocal. Although the late Silurian and Devonian was mostly a warm time in Earth history (Scotese, 2021; Scotese et al., 2021) with global temperatures between 2\u201310\u00b0C warmer than today (Fig. 16E), we observe little correlation between the dynamics of global temperature and of plant taxonomic diversity (Fig. 16A, E; see also Jones and Eichenseer, 2021 for further discussion).\nRhyniophytoids are more commonly found in the higher latitudes in the upper Silurian\u2013Lochkovian and may have been better suited to seasonal temperate climates (Edwards et al., 2001; Gerrienne et al., 2001; Gess and Prestianni, 2021). Moreover, Edwards and Richardson (2004) hypothesized that their life cycle was well-adapted to a seasonally arid tropical to subtropical climate such as found in southern Laurussia during those times. Zosterophyllopsids, on the other hand, were preferentially located in palaeotropical to palaeoequatorial regions, indicating that they may have favoured warmer and wetter conditions (Edwards and Richardson, 2004; Raymond et al., 2006; Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2015), although what adaptive features favoured those conditions are still unknown (P\u0161eni\u010dka et al., 2021). The climate progressively warmed from the late Silurian until the Pragian (Fig. 16D), possibly acting as a catalyst to the progressive demise of the basal-most tracheophytes, while favouring other groups (e.g., zosterophyllopsids). The colder climate beginning in the middle Emsian through the Middle Devonian may have reciprocally precipitated the zosterophyllopsid decline shown in Fig. 7C (Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud, 2015).\nDuring the late Emsian-Eifelian, lycopsids continuously diversified, whilst other clades such as the zosterophyllopsids and euphyllophytes (mainly basal euphyllophytes) were declining, particularly in the Eifelian (Fig. 7C, D). There is increasing evidence that lycopsids were the dominant (Fig. 7B) plant group inhabiting the highest palaeolatitudes in the Middle Devonian and may have been better adapted to cooler temperate climates (Moisan et al., 2011; Matsumura et al., 2015), whilst coeval assemblages from the palaeotropical regions were taxonomically more diverse. The colder conditions of the late Early to Middle Devonian may have favoured lycopsid diversification over euphyllophytes and zosterophyllopsids.\nThe diversification of vegetation in the Late Devonian was accompanied by generally warmer conditions (Scotese et al., 2021, Fig. 16E), with Archaeopteris trees growing both within the palaeoantarctic circle and in palaeoequatorial regions (Anderson et al., 1995; Gess and Whitfield, 2020). There is some evidence of glaciation in the latest Famennian in high to mid-palaeolatitude Laurussia and Gondwana (e.g., diamictites and dropstones \u2013 see Kaiser et al., 2016; Marshall et al., 2020), but there is no evidence of a corresponding decline in plant diversity in any of the major clades.\nHigh pCO2 levels have been implicated in the absence of megaphyllous leaves before the middle Pragian (e.g., Eophyllophyton; Fig. 3F) as they would have quickly overheated, restricting photosynthetic efficiency. However, as atmospheric CO2 levels decreased throughout the Devonian, leaf stomatal density would also have increased, allowing higher transpiration rates to cool the photosynthetic surfaces (Beerling et al., 2001; Xue et al., 2015a). Megaphylls also require an efficient hydraulic system to adjust to their higher water demands and this will have acted as a selective pressure towards more complex tissues such as secondary xylem (Osborne et al., 2004a, 2004b). Megaphylls would have been an important asset in the competition for light and space (Beerling and Fleming, 2007; Osborne et al., 2004b) and would have contributed to the observed euphyllophyte radiation in the Middle to Late Devonian (Figs. 7D, 10J\u2013L). The lycopsids, in contrast, were also prominent components of Middle Devonian and later Palaeophytic vegetation (Figs. 7B, 10D\u2013F), but did not develop megaphyllous leaves and achieved tree-sized statures using different strategies than euphyllophytes (Meyer-Berthaud and Decombeix, 2009).\n\n\n5.4\nTiming and evolution of early floras\nIncreasing complexity and the development of key innovations in land plants have been generally assumed to be one of the main drivers of the taxonomic diversification in Silurian\u2013Devonian vegetation (e.g., Prestianni et al., 2012, and references therein). Niklas et al. (1983) has previously shown that the earliest plant taxa (e.g., zosterophyllopsids, lycopsids) had longer longevities and lower diversification rates than taxa that appeared subsequently (e.g., monilophytes, spermatophytes). However, we have found no clear pattern emerging, although more primitive plant groups such as basal eutracheophytes, rhyniophytoids and zosterophyllopsids seem to have had lower longevities and diversification rates than euphyllophyte groups and lycopsids (Fig. 13B).\nBased on Foote\u2019s (2000b) approach (Fig. 12), extinction rates were shown to be slightly more significant than origination rates in explaining diversity changes in early vegetation. This suggests that extrinsic factors may be more influential than evolutionary innovations and ecological opportunities in explaining the diversity fluctuations in these floras. However, the difference is not very significant, and it is likely that there was more than one controlling factor. The kinetic model of Sepkoski (1978, 1979, 1984) predicts that evolutionary rates are diversity dependent: origination rates should decrease, and extinction rates increase with time, due to for instance ecological saturation and increased competition (Knoll et al., 1984). While, origination rates clearly decrease with time, extinction rates are relatively constant despite the two extinction peaks in the end-Pragian and end-Givetian (Fig. 9B).\nOverall diversity trajectories of tracheophytes in the Devonian can be mainly explained by the diversity fluctuations observed in the two most prominent clades, the lycophytes and euphyllophytes (Fig. 7A, D). However, major fluctuations in total diversity in the Devonian are never due to the diversity variations of only one clade. For instance, the Pragian and Givetian peaks and the Famennian maximum were each caused by in the diversification of at least two clades (Figs. 6\u20137). This supports a diversification pattern linked to major clade reorganisations, with the two major reductions in diversity corresponding to the starts of the Early Eophytic and Late Eophytic Floras of Cleal and Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana (2014, 2021; see also Capel et al., 2021).\nThe initial diversification of plants, between the middle Silurian and the Early Devonian (Pragian), is related to high origination rates (Fig. 9A) particularly among the lycophytes (Fig. 10A). However, as shown by Fig. 15, most of this initial pattern cannot be distinguished from sampling bias, especially during the Silurian. Interestingly, although zosterophyllopsids and lycopsids appear during the same epoch (Kotyk et al., 2002; Tims, 1980), they do not diversify significantly until the Lochkovian and Pragian, respectively (Figs.7B\u2013C, 10D, G), where significant peaks are observed (Fig. 15). In the Lochkovian, plant diversification was further triggered by the development of the Eotracheophytic Flora mostly dominated by basal eutracheophyte groups such as rhyniophytoids and taxa of unknown affinities (Capel et al., 2021). The subsequent replacement of the rhyniophytic by lycophytic vegetation in the Early Devonian is probably linked to the progressively better adaptation of lycophytes to the terrestrial environment with for example, some improvement in plant hydraulics rendering them more competitive against the rhyniophytic plants (Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana et al., 2019b; Decombeix et al., 2019). Consequently, plant diversity reached its first maximum in the middle to late Pragian with the domination of zosterophylls, together with other groups such as lycopsids and basal euphyllophytes (Figs. 6, 7B, D).\nThe Emsian and Eifelian represent the time of transition between the Early and Late Eophytic Flora reflected by the change from a zosterophyllopsid- to a lycopsid-dominated vegetation. Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana and Meyer-Berthaud (2014, 2015) suggested that the zosterophyllopsid decline after the Pragian may have been the result of competition with lycopsids and the earliest euphyllophytes; the evidence presented here suggests that the euphyllophytes may have been the more significant competitors. External, but unknown factors may also have played a part in the diversity decline. The lower diversity appears linked more to persistently low origination rates throughout the Emsian\u2013Eifelian time interval rather than increased extinction rates (Fig. 7A\u2013B). Moreover, sampling biases seem to have less impact than expected on the apparent dynamics of plant macrofossils through the Early-Middle Devonian boundary from which significant excursions are observed (Fig. 15). This would support the Cascales-Mi\u00f1ana\u2019s (2016) interpretation of the Eifelian depletion as the result of the overlapping of the different dynamics in three different clades (zosterophyllopsids, lycopsids, and euphyllophytes).\nThe Middle Devonian witnessed the appearance of the first forested landscapes as euphyllophyte (pseudosporochnalean cladoxylopsids and aneurophytes) and lycopsid plants increased in size and height (Meyer-Berthaud and Decombeix, 2009; Xue et al., 2018; Stein et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2020). In the Givetian, the congruent diversification of both the lycopsid and the euphyllophyte (progymnosperms and monilophytes) clades is of particular interest (Figs. 7B, E, 8D). The occurrence of convergent evolution both in terms of changes in reproduction (e.g., heterospory; Bateman and DiMichele, 1994) but also in the development of the tree-habit (Senkevitsch et al., 1993; Berry and Marshall, 2015; Crepet and Niklas, 2019, Berry, 2019), tends to suggest that these two clades were competing for the same resources of light and nutrients.\nThe Frasnian represents another transition period with the decline in diversity of progymnosperms, cladoxylopsids and lycopsids (Figs. 7A, 8C\u2013D). However, in the Famennian, another pulse of diversity is observed in both the lycopsids and euphyllophytes, the latter mainly deriving from the spermatophyte radiation (Figs. 7B, D, 8F). Prestianni and Gerrienne (2010) suggested that spermatophytes initially developed in upland marginal to extra-basinal habitats, but in the Late Devonian they took advantage of a progressive freeing of the Archaeopteris forest habitats in the lowlands, and so started to enter more regularly into the macrofossil record (Decombeix et al., 2011); this seems to be corroborated by the observed decline of progymnosperm diversity preceding the spermatophyte radiation (Fig. 8D, F). Indeed, spermatophytes do not appear to have diversified at the expense of lycopsids as they were both diversifying at this time (Figs. 7B, 8F). These changes in vegetation recorded in the Upper Devonian macrofloral record correspond to the change from Late Eophytic to Palaeophytic floras of Capel et al., 2021.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\n\n\n\ni.\nHere, we have supplied an in-depth characterization of the Silurian\u2013Devonian pattern of vascular plant macrofossils. Results have shown key diversification events linked to the development and demise of different plant groups such as, in a first order, lycophytes, and euphyllophytes, and in a second order, lycopsids, zosterophyllopsids, as well as monilophytes and lignophytes. Results have further revealed common patterns to be caused by major ecological changes occurring during the terrestrialization process. For instance, we see pronounced peaks, discernible in both the overall diversity and the diversity in the two main monophyletic clades, i.e., lycophytes and euphyllophytes, which punctuate the early plant diversity pattern. Likewise, we have identified major origination-extinction pulses that resulted in the main floral transitions over time, such as the change to a forested landscape during the Middle Devonian.\n\n\nii.\nFor the first time, the large-scale impact has been evaluated of sampling bias in our conception of the early radiation and diversification of vascular plants. Results have shown a highly significant correlation between the apparent diversity and the number of sampling sites through time, which suggests a strong sampling bias on the early land plant fossil record. However, we find a non-homogeneous sampling effect that suggests major gain and losses of diversity should reflect a true biological signal. Results have further shown that other factors, such as the amount of continental flooding could be influencing the observed patterns. Evidence seems to suggest that the increase of paralic habitats during regressive phases could have contributed to the early diversification of vegetation.\n\n\niii.\nMoreover, a comparison of abiotic factors with the observed diversity patterns does not show significant correlations, further stressing the importance of intrinsic factors on land plant diversification. Although climate change may have affected the dynamics of individual clades, especially among the lycophytes, its impact on vegetation diversity in this hothouse climate is unclear. Similarly, the role of decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels in the evolution and radiation of euphyllophytes still requires further investigation. O2 levels seem to have been unaffected by the expansion of terrestrial vegetation.\n\n\niv.\nFinally, taxonomic turnover rates appear not to be related to a different reproduction strategy of each plant group, as previously suggested. The main fluctuations in Devonian plant diversity were always triggered by variations in more than one clade and\/or plant group. Our results suggest that extrinsic factors may have been more influential than the appearance of evolutionary innovations in explaining the diversity patterns, and emphasize that the timeline of the early diversification of vascular plants is reflected in the Evolutionary Floras model.\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nFuture perspectives and research directions\nThis study highlights the sampling impact on major trends of plant diversity during the Silurian\u2013Devonian time interval. However, little is known about such impacts on particular plant groups and\/or paleogeographical regions, which is challenging. In fact, recent works (e.g., Wellman et al., 2022) suggest that floral diversity is impacted by palaeocontinental configuration, and intimately linked to the spatial distribution of collecting areas, which requires further investigations. This is especially relevant in order to infer how climate might have affected various plant clades and their likely climatic tolerances, which are to this day not yet well-circumscribed.\nThe changing nature of the rock record does have a major effect on sampling and the apparent plant diversity seen in the macrofossils. Future efforts should be focused on discerning how geological signal drives our understanding of plant diversification, especially among early land plants. This is a major gap in this discipline, especially if we consider that a global stratigraphic database is unavailable. This absence of a reliable estimation of terrestrial sedimentary outcrop area or rock volume hinders a full analysis of the potential effect of sampling bias on the diversity signal of early land plants. We believe that new integrative studies will further clarify the sampling issues and illuminate the interactions between early plants and abiotic factors, and that this will shed new light on the early history of how vegetation became adapted to subaerial life and laid the foundations for the terrestrial world as we see it today.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n\nComparison between the total diversity pattern using unequal time bins and the continuous-time average curve of plant diversity (A).

The most famous and first documented Plinian eruption is the one that occurred on the 79 CE at Vesuvius, which gave the name to this type of activity (Pyle, 2000; Cioni et al., 2015) and whose dedicated studies have given a great contribution to modern volcanology (e.g., Sigurdsson et al., 1985; Macedonio et al., 1988; Barberi et al., 1990). This eruption is classified as VEI (volcanic explosivity index) 6 (Cioni et al., 2003). Furthermore, the deposits from this eruption have allowed several researchers to investigate the impact effects on inhabited proximal areas (Gurioli et al., 2002, 2005a; Luongo et al., 2003a, 2003b; Zanella et al., 2007; Caricchi et al., 2014). At the time of the eruption, dense infrastructural networks, numerous cities and urban settlements, and a large amount of agricultural activities were present in such areas (e.g., Scandone et al., 2019). The 79 CE event is also one of the ancient eruptions that take the name directly from the date of occurrence; it is also known as the \u201cPompeii eruption\u201d. Various films (e.g., \u201cPompeii\u201d directed by P.W.S. Anderson, 2014), documentaries (e.g., \u201cPompeii - Ultima Scoperta\u201d by Radiotelevisione Italiana, 2020), and even a legendary Pink Floyd's concert (\u201cLive at Pompeii\u201d, 1972) have been realized in the last fifty years around the 79 CE eruption events. In 2022, Sigma Six (a contemporaneous Pink Floyd cover band) have proposed again \u201cLive at Pompeii\u201d with performances in two locations, S. Giovanni a Teduccio (Naples) and Baia (Bacoli), in the Neapolitan volcanic area. As an example, in the videoclip of \u201cCities in dust\u201d (1985) of Siouxie and the Banshees (a british punk\/new wave band of the eighties) the eruption that destroyed Pompeii has been represented as effusive to strombolian. Another example, in the song lyrics of \u201cPompeii\u201d (2013) of Bastille (a british pop\/rock band of the last decade), the eruption has been characterized by grey clouds bringing darkness, and by damaged walls, with an allusion to consequential social aspects. The iconic painting of \u201cVesuvius\u201d (1985) of Andy Warhol has been realized in the full spirit of Pop Art, which at those times was also merging with music and film industry. Numerous other painting reproductions of historical eruptions of Vesuvius have been illustrated by Ricciardi (2009). In the poetry \u201cLa Ginestra\u201d (1845) of Giacomo Leopardi, the main damages in the coastal towns and in Pompeii have been attributed to ash, blocks and pumice fall coupled with hot flows, with a clear reference to impact and resilience. All the historical, cultural, and scientific attention for the 79 CE eruption and Vesuvius does not preclude the current scientific need to further shed light on the dynamics of Plinian eruptions, which still are among the biggest natural events that may occur at active and populated volcanoes. The 79 CE eruption gives a unique opportunity to merge all the multidisciplinary studies together, and make a picture as complete as possible of the entire eruption from the magma chamber, through the conduit, to the far atmosphere and landscape. This eruption sequence has been reconstructed both by quantifying and integrating physical processes (magma ascent, column dynamics) and geological products (deposits from pyroclastic fall and flow and their associated dynamic phenomenology). The first goal of this paper is to review the several findings that have allowed dating precisely this eruption, which for a longtime was assumed to happen in the summer of 79 CE. Secondly, we will relate the various physical aspects of the 79 CE eruption with each other (stratigraphy, magma chamber, conduit, Plinian column, pyroclastic currents, atmosphere, and climate) as sub-domains of the whole explosive event. Consequently, the multidisciplinary approach used in this review will get to open issues, which will then be useful to shed further light on Plinian eruptions in the future, particularly from the observational, remote sensing, and modelling points of view. The present review does not explore in detail the impact that the eruption had on the nearby Roman towns (Fig. 1\n) and agricultural activities in proximal areas, as for the global (from magma to tephras) integrated methodology adopted for these complex eruptions; only the stratigraphy and the eruption effects at Pompeii are reviewed. On the other hand, some general impact indications on local static load, dynamic pressure, and emplacement temperature are given from the deposit features. A comprehensive contribution of this review is to present, for the first time, a full database with all the GPS coordinates and deposit thicknesses (in the number of 346; see ESM 1), in which the pyroclastic deposits have been reported and\/or studied, by extending the available dataset of Gurioli et al. (2010). The new data points, reviewed and attributed to the different eruption units, will be added: i) from medial to ultra-distal settings (Pollino, Calabria, Sicily); ii) from the existing points offshore in both proximal, distal and ultradistal areas; iii) from new points found in numerous archaeological excavations in the City of Naples (previously unknown). Such wide collection and revision of all points in which the 79 CE deposits have been found is a common thread in the review, and this will contribute to deepen the study of the entire sequence of eruptive events in Plinian eruptions, from the magma to the most distal tephras. In this direction, numerical modelling activities on the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius are reported, which will constrain, using this well studied eruption, the actual impact that Plinian eruptions can have at regional scale. The structure of the manuscript consists of an introduction and chronology of the eruption studies, nine self-consistent sections (one per investigation approach), and conclusions. The latter act as a common thread for the various sections and open to future developments on Plinian eruptions, which we treat as an only natural phenomenon from vent to deposit.\n\n\n2\nChronology of the eruption studies\nThe eruptive events occurred on the 79 CE at Vesuvius heavily damaged the Roman towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae (Fig. 1), and a significant part of the perivolcanic area within >10\u00a0km (Kent et al., 1981; Sigurdsson et al., 1985; Gurioli et al., 2002, 2005a; Cioni et al., 2004; Zanella et al., 2007; Caricchi et al., 2014). This eruption has become famous since the historical times of Pliny the Younger, when the Latin author observed, and a few decades later described, for the first time the \u201cPlinian\u201d eruption in two letters to Tacitus (Gigante, 1989). During the eruption, Pliny the Younger was at Capo Miseno (Fig. 1), a locality of Campi Flegrei about 30\u00a0km west of Vesuvius (Campania region) that allowed Pliny to describe, at a safe distance, the main events of the eruption. For modern times, all references about the main works on the various features of the 79 CE eruption are reported in ESM 2. A first detailed study of the pyroclastic products of the eruption was provided by Lirer et al. (1973). This pioneering work has represented a reference for the following studies. These authors first distinguished the pumices emitted in the 79 CE eruption from the ones emitted during the 3.9\u00a0ka Avellino Plinian eruption, the fallout of the latter being dispersed more toward ENE (see Di Vito et al., 2009). Then, they constructed an isopach map of the 79 CE pyroclastic fall deposits, and identified the dispersal area to the southeastern sector of Vesuvius. Lastly, they recognized a change in the colour of the pumices (white vs. grey) in the pyroclastic sequence, with some link to a compositional zonation in the magma chamber, as more deeply investigated petrologically (see section 7 for details). Sheridan et al. (1981) provided complementary information, with the identification of a withdrawal of the 79 CE magma chamber, then a collapse of the sedimentary basement, and the injection of external groundwater from confining aquifer into the chamber as an explanation of an increase in abundance of deep non-juvenile inclusions (metamorphics, skarns) in the upper grey pumice deposits (see Barberi et al., 1989). Sigurdsson et al. (1985) provided a more detailed stratigraphic reconstruction of the eruption sequence, integrating systematic field observations with the chronological accounts of Pliny the Younger. Later, Carey and Sigurdsson (1987) modelled the column height and the magma discharge rate, by using isopleth maps constructed with maximum pumice and lithic dimensions measured at different stratigraphic heights in the pyroclastic fall deposits. These latter two works provided the first quantitative results for the 79 CE eruption, indicating that the sustained Plinian eruption lasted about 19\u00a0h, erupted around 4\u00a0km3 of dense rock equivalent (DRE), and caused the emplacement of the white pumices mainly under fallout conditions, followed by the grey pumices under fallout and repeated partial column collapse conditions. These authors calculated the value of the DRE with the method of Rose et al. (1983) (as the product of isopach areas and deposit thicknesses, with an extrapolation beyond the last available isopach to account for very fine ash), and obtained a repartition of 1.0 and 2.7\u00a0km3 for the white and grey pumices, respectively, while the rest of the volume is referred to the initial and final stages of the eruption (0.7\u00a0km3). The calculated values of the column height and magma discharge rate for the white pumices were of 14 to 26\u00a0km and of 7.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 kg\/s, respectively, while for the grey pumices were of 26 to 32\u00a0km and of 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 kg\/s, respectively. To further reconstruct the dynamics of the 79 CE eruptive events, Barberi et al. (1989) and Cioni et al. (1992) produced grain size and componentry data from selected stratigraphic sections, and recognized three main phases of the eruption: an opening phreatomagmatic phase, a dominant Plinian magmatic phase (mostly the fallout sequence), and a final phreatomagmatic phase (mostly the pyroclastic currents sequence). Moreover, Cioni et al. (2003) recalculated the value of the DRE with the method of Pyle (1989) (as an exponential function for the decay of deposit thickness with distance), and found 1.1 and 1.8\u00a0km3 referred to the white and grey pumices, respectively. They also reported the dispersal area within the 10\u00a0cm isopach for the two pumice layers, which is of 1540\u00a0km2 for the white pumices, and of 3430\u00a0km2 for the grey pumices, further constraining the highest impact of the grey pumice sub-phase. Considering the variability of the reported DRE values, we were motivated to calculate, in a simple way, the extra volume between the last isopachs and the most distal area representing trace findings of the 79 CE eruption deposits (see section 6). Several other quantitative results have been produced for this well-studied Plinian eruption, which all are useful for a comprehensive quantitative and multidisciplinary reconstruction of the 79 CE eruption (ESM 2). These are presented in the following sections with the rationale enounced in the introduction (from magma to tephras).\n\n\n3\nThe date of the eruption\nThe 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius is very likely the most famous and better studied volcanic eruption in the history of volcanology (cf. Giacomelli et al., 2021). It is considered as the starting point of the modern volcanology, since the description made by Pliny the Younger in the abovementioned letters. However, one of the main open and still debated questions concerns the date of the eruption occurrence. Despite the date of August 24th is widely accepted in the literature, it derives from a medieval translation of the first Pliny's letter, which has been questioned several times since the 17th century (Ricciardi, 2009 and references therein). In this section, we will analyze all the available elements and clues, useful to definitely assert that the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius could not have occurred on August 24th but, rather, between October and November of that same year, as already suggested by Rolandi et al. (2007) based on pyroclast dispersal and archaeological findings. About two years ago a discovery occurred, during new excavations of the 79 CE deposits: this consists of a wall inscription in Pompeii (Fig. 2\n) that would confirm the hypothesis, already formulated for some time, that the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE took place in autumn and not on August 24th, as reported by the medieval transcription of the famous Pliny's letter (Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, Epistulae VI, 16). The inscription, written in charcoal on the wall of a house where restoration work was in progress at the time of the eruption, reports these textual words: \u201cXVI K Nov in[d] ulsit pro masumis esurit[ioni]\u201d, which translated means: \u201cThe sixteenth day before the kalends of November, he indulged in food in an immoderate way\u201d. The sixteenth day before the kalends of November, according to the way in which the days in ancient Rome were indicated, corresponds to the 17th of October. In ancient Rome, indeed, the days of the month were indicated by counting backwards with respect to the kalends, nones or ides, depending on which of these dates was closest. The kalends corresponded to the first day of each month, while the nones and ides fell on the fifth or seventh day, and the thirteenth or fifteenth day of the month, respectively, depending on the length of the months (Hannah, 2013, 2016). For example, August 24th was indicated as the ninth day before the kalends of September, including in the count the start and the end days. The obvious implication of the inscription finding is that, if the sentence was written on October 17th, the eruption could not have occurred before this date. Of course, the suspicion that the writing in question may date back to the previous year or before is legitimate, and then, as it is not indisputably demonstrable that the year of the inscription is 79 CE, the uncertainty about the precise date of the eruption still remains. However, some additional elements can be taken into consideration, which suggest the greatest probability that the event happened in the fall. The first element to be evaluated is the source from which the date of August 24th was taken: the first Pliny the Younger's letter to Tacitus. The document itself is universally recognized as reliable, since it was written by a direct witness to the events. Unfortunately, however, we do not have the original writing by Pliny, but only some transcriptions from the medieval era. One of these, in particular, the work of a monk of the 9th century, reported in the \u201cCodex Laurentianus Mediceus\u201d bears the date of August 24th (nonum Kal. Septembres, the ninth day before the kalends of September). However, already in the 2nd-3rd century A.D., a writing by the historian Dio Cassius seems to indicate a different period for the eruption, which he would place in the second part of the autumn of the first year of the empire of Titus (DCCCXXXII Ab Urbe Condita, is that 79 CE; Dione Cassio, 2000), after his fifteenth acclamation. The acclamation was an official act of the Roman Senate, which was registered when an imperial proposal was approved unanimously or on the occasion of important military achievements. It was often celebrated with the minting of a coin, which had the effigy of the emperor and the acclamation number imprinted on it. This is a very important detail since it brings us back to an event that can be considered irrefutable proof that the eruption did not take place on August 24th: the discovery of a coin, a silver denarius that bears the image of the emperor Titus with the inscription XV Imp (Fig. 3\n; Stefani, 2006). According to other inscriptions that report the date of September 7th or 8th for the Titus' fourteenth acclamation (Cagnat et al., 1927; Merlin, 1962), the following one must have occurred later, and consequently the eruption must necessarily have occurred after the month of August (very likely after the month of September, to give time to the coin to circulate after minting). Another clue that argues against the summer date of August 24th can be deduced from the Pliny's letter itself, in which he said that Admiral Pliny the Elder, having received the request for help from Rectina (the Tascus' wife, a friend of him), drops the quadriremes into the sea (deducit quadriremes). The use of the verb \u201cdeducit\u201d, which literally means \u201cleads down\u201d, recalls the \u201cmare clausum\u201d (literally \u2018closed sea\u2019) of the ancient Romans. The Roman fleet, in charge of the control of the lower Mediterranean, every year in September, close to the autumn equinox, retreated safely to the winter quarters in the port of Miseno. The navigation resumed in springtime, with the festival called \u201cNavigium Isidis\u201d in honor of the Egyptian goddess Isis, patroness of the sea, sailors, and maritime activities. Therefore, the fact that it was necessary to lead the ships down into the sea suggests that the \u201cmare clausum\u201d had already begun and autumn was started (Ricciardi, 2009). Furthermore, there are other transcriptions of the letter of Pliny the Younger which bear the date of November 1st (Kal. Novembres), such as that of the Codex venetus translated by Pier Alessandro Paravia in 1827 (Ricciardi, 2009), and others that bear the date of October 24th (nonum Kal. Novembres). The abbot Braccini (1632) also reports what was written about a transcription of the Pliny's letter by a Commentator who, considering a printing error the words \u201cNon. Kal. Sept \u201c, said that these should have been reported as \u201cKal. Novembres\u201d. Therefore, the date of August 24th would be an error in the Laurentianus Mediceus code, to date the oldest (9th century A.D.) but not the most reliable for this. A plausible hypothesis to justify the choice of this date could be that of a symbolic backdating, willingly chosen during the Middle Ages by some monastery chroniclers and scholars, interested in telling about eruptive events for religious or political purposes. In medieval times, it was a common practice to date events modifying both their beginning and duration in order to make them coincide with the striking phenomenon (mirabilia), which was the subject of the hagiographic telling. As an example, we can recall the adaptation of the date of birth of Jesus, moved by the emperor Constantine in 330 CE to December 25th, to make it coincide with the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (Day of Birth of the Undefeated Sun) and to superimpose it on the cult of the god Mithras (Ricciardi, 2009). On August 24th the Romans celebrated the \u201cVulcanalia\u201d and the exit of souls from the afterlife through the \u201cmundus\u201d, a sort of deep and vast pit in the center of the city, which represented a connection point between the Underworld and the world of the living. The foundation of a city or any Roman colony involved a particular ritual action: the excavation of the mundus, which was then covered with a closing stone, called \u201clapis manalis\u201d. On August 24th of each year, the \u201clapis manalis\u201d was opened and the ritual of \u201cmundus patet\u201d (the mundus is open) was performed. During this ritual the gates of the underworld were opened and the souls of the dead could return to the world of the living and wander through the city. After three days the \u201clapis manalis\u201d was closed and everything returned to normal (Ricciardi, 2009). Therefore, the date of August 24th emphasizes the medieval belief that a volcanic eruption opens the door of Hell, and the day of the \u201cmundus patet\u201d of the ancient Roman ritual of the Vulcanalia must have seemed to medieval monks the best date to open the Vesuvius' crater, considered the \u201cfunnel of Hell\u201d throughout the Middle Ages. Moreover, Rolandi et al. (2007) demonstrated that the mainly southward-oriented dispersal of the fallout deposits of the 79\u00a0CE eruption is compatible with the Autumn-Winter dominant direction of the stratospheric winds, rather than that of the Summer winds (Macedonio et al., 1988). With these elements, it is now possible to definitively establish that the date of the eruption cannot be August 24th but must be limited to an interval that goes from September 7th\/8th (date of the silver denarius with the fifteenth acclamation of Tito) to November 1st (the most recent date among those deriving from the various transcriptions of Pliny's letter). This, and particularly the year of occurrence, are corroborated by ArAr datations available by Lanphere et al. (2007). Lastly, if we add to all this complementary information the finding of typically autumn fruits, such as dried figs, walnuts, chestnuts, and pomegranates, that the wine had already been sealed in the \u201cdolia\u201d (the large terracotta containers found in many houses in Pompeii), and again that many of the victims wore heavy clothes and in many houses there already were braziers to heating the rooms (Ricciardi, 2009), then it follows that it was late autumn already, and therefore the most probable date must necessarily fall between October 24th and November 1st.\n\n\n4\nStratigraphy\nThe main studies on the general stratigraphy of the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius are mentioned at various degrees of detail in the introductory sections. In the present section, the eruption stratigraphy is reviewed following, in particular, the detailed stratigraphic and sedimentological studies of Cioni et al. (1990, 1992, 2004) on the entire succession of the eruption deposits, complemented by the ones of Gurioli et al. (2002, 2005b) on the Pompeii and Herculaneum impact dynamics, and by the database of Gurioli et al. (2010). The database is integrated with new findings from the City of Naples, Pollino, Velia, Sicily, and revised offshore data, for a total number of 346 points (ESM 1). The term of Eruption Unit (EU) of Cioni et al. (1992) is borrowed here to describe those pyroclastic deposits formed in a single phase of the 79 CE eruption characterized by a distinctive eruptive mechanism and style, in the framework of general volcanic stratigraphy (Manville et al., 2009; Mart\u00ed et al., 2018; N\u00e9meth and Palmer, 2019). Also, the general term of pyroclastic current, and not pyroclastic density current, is used to describe lateral flow processes, because such a current does not necessarily behave as a density current, i.e. it can be sustained by eruption dynamics vs. local topography (Doronzo, 2012; Palladino, 2017; Doronzo et al., 2022). In particular, eight Eruption Units (EU1 to EU8) are recognized in the pyroclastic sequence of the eruption, some of which are further subdivided in sub-units emplaced by pyroclastic currents (EUXpf, where X is EU numbering). For the sake of clarity, a correlation of the stratigraphic frameworks of the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius provided by different authors is reported in Table 1\n. We reviewed the entire eruption sequence in proximal reaches at Cava Pozzelle, Terzigno (located 4.5\u00a0km southeast of the current Vesuvius' crater) (Figs. 1 and 4\n) and in the Pompeii area (see next section for details). It follows a general description of the 79 CE eruption sequence for each EU, from bottom (EU1) to top (EU8), including all details (e.g., lithic % by volume) needed for characterizing the timing and macroscopic impact dynamics of the eruption:\n\n\u2022\nEU1. It consists of whitish-grey, massive and sometimes normally-graded, accretionary lapilli-bearing fine ash fall deposits, with a dominant distribution toward the East (Fig. 5\n). This unit is mainly present on the slopes of Vesuvius, where it forms a thin blanket with a maximum thickness of about 15\u00a0cm, and more sporadically in the southeastern part of the Campanian Plain at about 20\u00a0km from the vent. At some sites on the western slopes of the volcano, this unit is associated with narrowly dispersed, fine-grained pyroclastic current deposits. It records a first transient phreatomagmatic phase, which marked the opening of the conduit. The exact timing of the deposition of EU1 is not very clear, but this event could have triggered the first plea for help to Pliny the Elder from the Vesuvian area, which was reported to have occurred around noon.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU2f. It consists of thick, white phonolitic highly-vesiculated pumice lapilli fall deposits (white pumices, with dimensions from a few cm to decimeter), with a distribution toward the South-East (isopach map in Fig. 5). The deposits are massive, reversely-to normally-graded and lithic-poor (minor lavas up to decimeter, limestones and rarer marbles at 10\u201320% tot.), and roughly represent 25% of the total erupted magma. This unit is present in a southeastern dispersal fan around Vesuvius, with a double maximum thickness of about 1\u00a0m close to Pompeii and in the southern part of the volcano. It records a sustained eruptive column phase, and is the second most voluminous unit in the pyroclastic sequence. In more proximal areas, this unit is capped by thin pyroclastic current deposits (described in the next unit).\n\n\n\u2022\nEU2\/3pf. It consists of thin plane parallel to cross-bedded pyroclastic current deposits, mainly distributed around the vent, but also reaching a distance of about 7\u00a0km from the vent in the southern part of Vesuvius (Fig. 5). This unit is faintly laminated, fine-grained with lithic lapilli scattered in lenses of rounded pumice lapilli. It locally thickens in correspondence of topographic lows, still maintaining a thinly stratified facies. Lava ballistics with dimensions up to 25\u00a0cm are dispersed (Fig. 6a,b). It records a first phase of partial column collapse, and the first major change in the eruption dynamics, coincident with an important change in magma composition from phonolitic to tephri-phonolitic. The pyroclastic current reached Herculaneum, likely causing the death of the inhabitants, and Terzigno causing partial demolition of the Roman Villae Rusticae and Oplontis.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU3f. It consists of thick, grey tephri-phonolitic pumice lapilli fall deposits (grey pumices, with dimensions from a few cm to decimeter), with a distribution toward the South-East (isopach map in Fig. 5). The deposits are massive, reversely-to normally-graded and contain lithic fragments (lavas, limestones, marbles, and rarer cumulitic and metasomatic rocks at 20\u201325% tot.), and roughly represent 55% of the total erupted magma. Wall-rock lithic blocks are abundant particularly in the upper part of the unit, and also in the form of outsized lava ballistics with dimensions up to 25\u00a0cm (Fig. 6a,b). This unit is present in a southeastern dispersal fan around Vesuvius, with an only maximum thickness of about 1.5\u00a0m in the Pompeii area, while it is reduced or lacking in the southern part of the volcano. It records a dominant sustained eruptive column phase, and is the most voluminous unit in the pyroclastic sequence. Both EU2f and EU3f reach maximum thicknesses at distances of about 10\u201315\u00a0km from the vent.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU3pf. It consists of stratified, undulatory bedded to dune bedded pyroclastic current deposits, locally grading into deposits with a massive facies. The deposits consist of pumice lapilli and coarse to fine lithics (lavas and minor deep-seated rocks) in a fine to coarse ash matrix, in which there also are dispersed bombs and blocks of several cm. Decimeter-sized fragments of charred trunks are locally dispersed, indicating an emplacement temperature of around 300\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 6c). This unit consists of multiple sub-units that drape the topography, and has an average thickness of about 1\u20132\u00a0m, with a strong thinning in correspondence of topographic highs and thickening in correspondence of topographic lows, and reaches a distance of about 10\u00a0km from the vent (Fig. 5). It records at least three phases (one\/sub-unit) of partial eruptive column collapse within the dominant EU3f phase, and this makes EU3f more eroded (still thicker) than EU2f in proximal reaches. At Cava Pozzelle, for example, there are at least two partial collapse sub-units, and one total collapse unit. Laterally, the upper EU3pf thickens significantly up to several meters in correspondence of the topographic lows, and acquires a massive pumice-rich facies inglobating charred woods (valley-ponded ignimbrite), with a traction carpet-dominated part at the base. The pyroclastic currents caused the destruction of some Roman Villae Rusticae located on the slopes of the volcano such as in Oplontis, partial demolition of buildings in Herculaneum, and the death of some of the inhabitants. In particular, the last of these pyroclastic currents from partial column collapse emplaced a thin, coarse to fine ash layer (EU3pfi) in proximity of the city walls of Pompeii.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU3pftot. This unit corresponds to total eruption column collapse, and generation of a powerful, radially-moving pyroclastic current. The deposits, up to 10\u00a0m thick in proximal areas, are stratified but laterally and vertically grade into massive deposits, as the result of a depositional boundary layer subjected to a significant transition from traction-dominated and low accumulation rate to forced deposition and higher accumulation rate (Fig. 5). At Cava di Pollena (4\u00a0km from vent), for example, EU3pftot thickens significantly in correspondence of the topographic lows, and acquires a massive pumice-rich facies with charred woods; at the base, the unit is finer and more structured. Although EU3pftot barely reached the southeastern limits of Pompeii with a thickness of only a few cm, it is possible that the EU3pftot phase caused the deaths of some of the inhabitants.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU3pfL. The pure magmatic phase (started with EU2f) ceased with the emplacement of lithic-rich pyroclastic current deposits within the first 2\u00a0km from the vent to the north and northwest. These narrowly dispersed deposits are matrix-supported and mainly composed by ash with unaltered lava clasts, eroded from the subsurface, and subordinated white and grey pumice fragments. The high temperatures of deposition recorded by these fragments agree with rapid deposition from a slow-moving pyroclastic current directly overflowing from the vent.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU4. The base of this unit is composed, where not fully eroded, by a thin, lithic-rich, grain-supported lapilli deposit (EU4bl) dispersed toward the South-East, and emplaced during some short-lived eruptive column dynamics. This deposit is often laminated in the upper part, and is followed by stratified, undulatory bedded to dune bedded pyroclastic current deposits (EU4pf) with a thickness of about 4\u00a0m in the proximal part of Vesuvius, changing into deposits with massive to laminated facies at about 6\u20137\u00a0km from the vent, and with a massive accretionary lapilli-bearing facies in the distal part of the volcano (Fig. 5). The deposits are lithic-rich (lavas, marbles, limestones, skarns and cumulites), and consist of pumice and lithic lapilli in a fine to coarse ash matrix, in which there are outsized lava and dense pumice ballistics with dimensions up to a few decimeters, and the deposits are capped by an accretionary lapilli-bearing ash layer of several cm. At Cava di Pollena, for example, EU4pf assumes a well-indurated facies particularly in the topographic lows. This unit is distributed radially from the vent and reaches a distance of about 21\u00a0km in the southern part of the volcano, and of >15\u00a0km toward the center of the city of Naples. It records a significant phreatomagmatic phase, representing the climactic phase of the eruption through a first destabilization of the magma chamber, external water-magma interaction, and full eruption column collapse; it is the most widespread unit in the pyroclastic current sequence. The pyroclastic current caused partial destruction of buildings and the death of all the surviving inhabitants in Pompeii, and it even reached the Sorrento Peninsula and the territory presently occupied by the City of Naples. In Fig. 5, an integration of literature data of the deposit thicknesses with more new data collected in archaeological excavations and trenches is presented. This is the widest distributed pyroclastic current EU in the entire sequence of the 79 CE eruption, covering a radial area around Vesuvius of at least 445\u00a0km2 on land.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU5. It consists of lithic-rich, massive to dune bedded pyroclastic current deposits (Fig. 4). The deposits are composed by coarse ash, grey pumice lapilli, and abundant lithics at 40\u201350%. This unit is only present on the slopes and in the main valleys of Vesuvius, reaching north Boscoreale, with a thickening and a strong control in correspondence of the topographic lows. It is completely absent in the southern medial areas. It records a further destabilization phase of the magma chamber, and formation of small pyroclastic currents.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU6. It consists of thick (up to 10\u00a0m), massive poorly-sorted pyroclastic current deposits, with abundant lithic fragments from the whole basement of Vesuvius (limestones, marbles, syenites, monzonites at about 60% tot.), and showing a very coarse breccia facies with lithic lava blocks and boulders (up to meter-sized) particularly in proximal reaches (Fig. 4). The deposits consist of pumice lapilli and very abundant lithic fragments in a fine to coarse ash matrix. This unit is distributed following the topography, mainly filling topographic lows in the southeastern part of the volcano, and reaching a distance of about 6\u00a0km from the vent. It records the culmination of the destabilization of the magma chamber into its definitive roof collapse phase, and formation of a pyroclastic current, i.e. the climax of caldera collapse.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU7. The general description of this unit is similar to the one for EU4, with the difference that it consists of a less regular facies variation in pyroclastic current deposits that are thinner (Fig. 4). The deposit sequence, in particular, consists of a lapilli-enriched layer with porphyritic scoriae and lithic fragments (marbles and phlogopite-bearing clinopyroxenites at 50\u201360% tot.), and a massive to dune bedded fine ash layer, capped by a thick accretionary lapilli-bearing ash layer. This unit is mainly distributed in the southern part of Vesuvius, reaching a distance of about 15\u00a0km from the vent. It records a final transient phreatomagmatic phase, and formation of a pyroclastic current, which left an ash deposit in Pompeii.\n\n\n\u2022\nEU8. It consists of thick, finely alternating ash-fall and flow deposits, with a stratified accretionary lapilli-bearing facies (Fig. 4). This unit is lithic-rich (with fresh lava fragments), is slightly lithified in the distal reaches, and is mainly distributed in the northern and western parts of Vesuvius following the topography, while in the southern part of the volcano it shows more evidently such fall-and-flow alternation. The maximum distance of finding of this unit, at Stabiae, is about 15\u00a0km from the vent. It records the final evolution and the waning stages of the eruption through multiple phreatomagmatic pulses.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nVolcanic deposits, timing, and related effects at the Roman town of Pompeii\nIn 79 CE, the ancient city of Pompeii (Fig. 1), located 9.5\u00a0km southeast of the current Vesuvius' crater, met its fate being buried under a thick blanket (6\u20137\u00a0m) both of fall and pyroclastic current deposits. Following the early excavations started in 1748 (Maiuri, 1958), systematic archaelogical investigations have brought to light a large part of the city, which has become one of the most important archaeological site worldwide, as well as a volcanological heritage and milestone in modern volcanology (Scandone et al., 2019; Giacomelli et al., 2021, and references therein). Strictly from the archaeological excavation point of view (beyond the main goal here), a comprehensive work on recent studies at Pompeii is the volume XXXII - 2021 of Rivista di Studi Pompeiani, which we referred to. On the other hand, numerous volcanological studies conducted in Pompeii have investigated several aspects of the eruption, including: (i) stratigraphy (Sigurdsson et al., 1985; Cioni et al., 1990, 1992; Scarpati et al., 2020); (ii) influence of the urban structure on the pyroclastic current direction and impact (Luongo et al., 2003a; Gurioli et al., 2005a, 2007; Ruggieri et al., 2020); (iii) causes of death of the inhabitants (Giacomelli et al., 2003; Luongo et al., 2003b; Scandone et al., 2019); (iv) temperature of the pyroclastic currents (Cioni et al., 2004; Gurioli et al., 2005a; Zanella et al., 2007, 2014), and sedimentation dynamics of such currents (Dellino et al., 2021); and (v) heat effects on frescoes (Marcaida et al., 2019). In this section, the interplay among local stratigraphy, sequence of volcanic events, damages and victims at Pompeii archaeological site caused by the eruption is reported (Fig. 7\n), by exploring the available literature (see also section 3). A synthesis of the 79 CE stratigraphy is presented giving a review of the available stratigraphic sections, located both inside and outside the city walls. The most detailed stratigraphic study, based on 39 sections, is reported by Gurioli et al. (2007). Other scattered sections, studied during excavations, are reported by other authors (Marturano and Varone, 1997, 2005; Luongo et al., 2003a; Scarpati et al., 2020). The analysis of the stratigraphic sections gives information on almost the entire sequence of the events occurred during the eruption in medial reaches. Stratigraphy is described according to the EUs presented in the previous section, while the timing of volcanic phenomena and related damages follows the eruption chronology reconstructed by Sigurdsson et al. (1985) and Cioni et al. (2000). Archaeological exploration is still underway in Pompeii, and in the last few years many outstanding findings were unearthed (e.g., the Termopolium of Regio V, with a decorated counter or the so-called \u201cRoom of the slaves\u201d), giving new priceless information to the archaeologists on many aspects of the culture and lifestyle at Pompeii. In order to pursue the multidisciplinary approach that characterizes this work, the description of the 79 CE stratigraphy is enriched here with some of the latest (2018\u20132021) archaeological discoveries made in Pompeii, which can have volcanological implications on the effects of the eruption (Rivista di Studi Pompeiani - vol. XXXII, 2021). At Pompeii, the sequence is composed only of five (EU2f, EU3f, EU4, EU7, and EU8) of the 8 EUs generated during the 79 CE eruption (Table 1 and Fig. 7). This event began after noon on October 24th with a phreatomagmatic ash fall spreading toward East, and emplacing an accretionary lapilli-bearing, whitish ash deposit (EU1). This ash fall did not reach Pompeii. The eruption continued, at 1\u00a0pm, with the formation of a sustained Plinian column, which gave a pumice lapilli and blocks fall deposit toward South-East that grades vertically from white (EU2f) to grey (EU3f) pumices. This phase of the eruption lasted about 18\u201319\u00a0h. At Pompeii, the pumice fall deposit is crudely stratified due to vertical grain-size variations (EU3f appears coarser and poorer sorted than EU2f), it contains lithic clasts made up of lava, limestone and rare cumulite fragments and attains a maximum total thickness of 2.8\u00a0m. Centimeter- to decimeter-sized ballistic blocks and bombs, composed by lava, limestone and pumice fragments, are dispersed throughout the fall deposit (Fig. 6d). Local anomalous thickening, up to 5\u00a0m, has been reported inside houses, due to drainage of pumice lapilli from roofs through compluvia (rectangular holes at the center of the roof) and accumulation into impluvia (rectangular basins with the function of rainwater collection coming from compluvia), or alleys, due to rolling and sliding of pumice lapilli in the presence of sloping roofs (Luongo et al., 2003a; Cioni et al., 2000). The thick accumulation of lapilli engulfed the ground floor of the buildings, protecting them from the impact of the multiple pyroclastic currents generated during the following eruption phases. Damages and victims in this phase of the eruption are associated with the overload exerted by the pumice lapilli accumulated on flat or low-sloping roofs. As evidenced by the analysis of the stratigraphic sections, roof collapses occurred during the emplacement of EU2f, at a few hours from the beginning of the fallout, below a deposit thickness of 60\u00a0cm (Cioni et al., 1992) corresponding to a static load on the roof exceeding about 500\u00a0kg\/m2. These collapses caused hundreds of victims among the inhabitants. In fact, 394 bodies were found below and within the pumice fall deposit as a consequence of the roof collapses (Luongo et al., 2003b). Then, partial collapses of the Plinian column generated pyroclastic currents at the transition between the white and the grey pumice phases (EU2\/3pf), as well as during the emplacement of the grey pumice phase (EU3pf), in the night of October 24th and early morning of October 25th. The stratigraphic sequence inside and all around Pompei gives evidence that only the last of these pyroclastic currents reached Pompeii, likely around 6:30\u00a0am, without entering the city. This pyroclastic current laps onto the northwestern edge of Pompeii, emplacing a thin, massive, coarse- to fine-ash layer (EU3pfi) containing few millimeter-sized lithic lava clasts, a few centimeters below the top of EU3f (Fig. 7). Otherwise, Scarpati et al. (2020) have reported the occurrence of this ash horizon (their unit C1; Table 1) well inside the city, in a restricted sector of Regio V (northern part of Pompeii). According to the experiments and numerical modelling of Doronzo and Dellino (2011) on pyroclastic current-building interaction, urban structures can act as flow baffles depending on how the urbanization is articulated. The top of EU3f is overlain by two, massive to well-stratified, coarse to fine ash layers containing fine pumice lapilli separated by a thin horizon of fine pumice lapilli (EU3pftot). Total thickness of this unit is usually few centimeters, although it can reach a maximum of 30\u00a0cm. The lower ash layer has a predominantly massive structure, while the upper layer is characterized by different lithofacies (Gurioli et al., 2007). It was emplaced around 7:30\u00a0am, and is the result of a pyroclastic current that followed the ultimate total collapse of the eruption column marking the end of the magmatic phase. The current reached Pompeii and entered the city by overcoming its walls, without leaving any remarkable visible effects on the buildings, although Cioni et al. (2000) reported the occurrence of tiles and bricks in the resulting deposit. In addition, parts of skeletons were found in a thin unit (Sigurdsson et al., 1985; Cioni et al., 2000) buried by deposits of the overlying unit (EU4), suggesting that some victims were associated to this phase of the eruption. The transition to the caldera-forming and phreatomagmatic phase was marked by the resumption of a short-lived eruption column that lasted about 25\u00a0min (Gurioli et al., 2007). The resulting deposit is a basal, grain-supported, mainly massive, lithic lapilli-rich layer (EU4bl) having a maximum thickness of 7\u00a0cm in Pompeii (Fig. 7). The fall origin of this horizon is testified by its mantle bedding fashion even on undulated surfaces; such horizon is more laminated at other places (e.g., Cava Pozzelle, Terzigno). Undulations are mainly related to the attitude of the underlying pumice fall deposit to mantle standing walls. Lithic clasts are mainly composed of lavas, minor limestones and marbles. Centimeter-sized, ballistic lava clasts and impact sags can occur at the interbed surface with the underlying EU3pf, while juvenile clasts are subordinate and composed by grey pumices. This basal layer is overlain by a grey, matrix-supported, coarse- to fine-ash deposit containing grey, rounded pumice lapilli, accretionary lapilli and minor lithic clasts set into the matrix (EU4pf). The amount of accretionary lapilli increases upward. Lithic clasts are mainly made up of lavas, minor limestones and rare cumulites. Tiles and bricks are common in this unit. This deposit is characterized by a great thickness variability both inside and outside Pompeii. According to Gurioli et al. (2007), the thickness of EU4pf ranges from a few decimeters to 2.15\u00a0m, although thicknesses up to 3.3\u00a0m have been reported inside some buildings (Luongo et al., 2003a). This unit shows different lithofacies (Gurioli et al., 2007). The most common vertical lithofacies association varies from a basal massive ash containing rounded pumice lapilli (and locally decimeter-sized lithic clasts and building fragments), emplaced under local accumulation rates of the order of tens of (to a hundred) kg\/m2s, through a crudely to diffuse stratified ash containing rounded pumice lapilli to a planar- to undulated to low-angle, cross-stratified fine ash at the top. Fines-depleted lenses composed by fine to coarse pumice lapilli can be found in this unit. Locally, in Pompeii, this deposit rests directly on the grey pumice lapilli deposit due to the erosion of EU4bl and EU3pftot. The sequence of EU4 ends with an accretionary lapilli-bearing, massive to faintly laminated, light grey ash layer up to 20\u00a0cm thick. According to Cioni et al. (1990, 1992, 2020), this accretionary lapilli-bearing layer is interpreted as a co-ignimbrite ash fall associated with the emplacement of EU4pf. Alternatively, Scarpati et al. (2020) assume this layer (their unit F) as emplaced directly from a pyroclastic current. The flow unit in EU4 resulted from the most powerful pyroclastic current that got to Pompeii, at around 8\u00a0am, during the climax of the phreatomagmatic phase, ravaging the entire city, damaging or knocking down walls and killing the inhabitants who survived during the Plinian phase (Figs. 7 and 8\n). The energy of this pyroclastic current is even testified by its capacity to erode, locally, the underlying units. According to Doronzo et al. (2012), Roche (2015), Trolese et al. (2019), and Doronzo et al. (2022), that was a fully inertial pyroclastic current not concomitant with eruption column collapse, and the current had a highly-mobile depositional system (fed from the upper transport system) capable of entraining and transporting outsized clasts into the flow. According to Luongo et al. (2003b), 650 victims were found in EU4pf (their unit E) laying a few centimeters above the base of this unit. The recent excavation of a \u201cvilla suburbana\u201d at Civita Giuliana, 700\u00a0m northwest of the ancient Pompeii city walls, has returned further evidence that this pyroclastic current was a relentless killer. Skeletal parts of two victims of the eruption were found in a 2.2\u00a0m wide room, probably having the function of passageway from the cryptoporticus to the upper floor, in the noble part of the villa (Toniolo et al., 2021). Casts of the victims were obtained according to a technique developed in the second half of the 19th century by Giuseppe Fiorelli (see Osanna, 2021), by pouring liquid plaster into the void left by the decomposition of the corpses. The analysis of the stratigraphic position of the casts (Toniolo et al., 2021) shows that the victims rest about 10\u00a0cm above the base of EU4pf, in turn resting on few centimeters of pumice lapilli (Fig. 8a,b). The absence of the ash layers of EU3pf suggests that the early pyroclastic currents reaching Pompeii were not able to penetrate inside this room. In 2018, three horses (Fig. 8c), one of them still with its harness, were found in a stable, located in the servants' part of the same villa, most likely killed by the same pyroclastic current. Furthermore, in 2021, a four-wheeled processional chariot (Fig. 8d) with well-preserved bronze decorations was found in a portico, just outside the stable, probably overlooking an open courtyard. From the evidence in Fig. 8d, we can argue that the burial of the chariot started during the fallout phase, with emplacement of the grey pumice (EU3f) and likely the ash layers of EU3pf, and ended with the emplacement of EU4pf. The pumice lapilli deposit appears to thin left to right, probably as a consequence of rolling and\/or sliding of pumice lapilli on the sloping canopy of the portico, and forming a heap along the edge of the canopy. Successively, the EU4pf pyroclastic current interacted with the structure emplacing an ash deposit (that thickens on the heap of lapilli) and entombed the chariot, preserving it from full deterioration. The interaction between this pyroclastic current and the urban structure of Pompeii has been studied in detail by Luongo et al. (2003a) and Gurioli et al. (2005a, 2007), and can be compared with the general experimental and modelling results of Doronzo and Dellino (2011) on pyroclastic current-building interaction. From the analysis of the 79 CE deposits in Pompeii, the dense basal part of the parental pyroclastic current was partially deflected by the buildings, while the more dilute upper part was not particularly affected by the urban structure of Pompeii. In terms of damage assessment, we can conclude that the orientation of the walls appears to be a fundamental parameter during flow-building interaction. Walls parallel to the current direction were minimally damaged, while walls perpendicular to the current direction were strongly impacted under locally-variable flow pressures (cf. Zuccaro and Ianniello, 2004; Doronzo and Dellino, 2011). In many sections at Pompeii, damaged walls show a channel-shaped profile (Luongo et al., 2003a). Where successive walls (two or more) are closely spaced, the depth and amount of the damage to the walls is lower downcurrent. This observation, along with the distribution of the deposits around the buildings, suggest that the removal of the pyroclasts from the current by forced deposition is a key factor for the impact of the local flow. On the other hand, the presence of decimeter-sized building and lava fragments incorporated in EU4pf is evidence, through quantitative sedimentology, that the pyroclastic current had the capacity to entrain and transport outsized external clasts under flow dynamic pressures of 5\u201310\u00a0kPa (cf. Roche, 2015; Mart\u00ed et al., 2019). EU5 and EU6, representing the deposits emplaced during the climax of the caldera collapse (see section 4), are completely lacking at Pompeii. EU7 is a stratified deposit, up to 13\u00a0cm thick, composed by two, clast-supported, massive, lithic lapilli-rich horizons separated by a cohesive ash horizon containing few mm-sized lithic lava clasts set into the matrix. EU7 is overlain by a massive to faintly laminated accretionary lapilli-bearing layer (EU7pf; Gurioli et al., 2007). The transition to EU8 is marked by a very thin (below 0.5\u00a0cm) clast-supported horizon composed by coarse ash to very fine lapilli, made up of lava fragments, overlain by a sequence of accretionary lapilli-bearing layers, having a total thickness <1\u00a0m, emplaced during the final and waning phase of the eruption (Fig. 7). EU8 is composed by an alternation of ash layers, up to 10\u00a0cm thick. Each layer is characterized by a massive to crudely stratified base overlain by an accretionary lapilli-rich top. EU8 records multiple phreatomagmatic pulses that generated pyroclastic currents, and minor fallout, flowing over an already ravaged and almost completely buried area (no artefacts are reported for this unit), which contributed to the burial of the ancient Pompeii.\n\n\n6\nDistal and ultra-distal deposits\nThe pyroclastic products emitted during the 79 CE explosive eruption are distributed all around Vesuvius, but particularly in the southern and southeastern parts of the volcano. Although the 79 CE deposits have a radial distribution with respect to the vent, they show a preferential dispersion in the fan-shaped area south of the volcano, bordered by the surrounding mountains (Gurioli et al., 2010). The pyroclastic current deposits are quite well distributed in such a fan on land, on the other hand they have been found in marine cores off the coastline of the Naples Bay (Sacchi et al., 2005, 2009; Insinga et al., 2008). These are decimeters-thick primary deposits resulting from the entrance of the pyroclastic currents into the sea, locally showing some reworking and interaction-with-water processes in the form of distal turbidity current deposits. They are quite thick close to the coast, particularly in correspondence of the Sarno River mouth (Fig. 1), where they reach a couple of meters (Sacchi et al., 2005). The most distal sites in which the 79 CE pyroclastic current deposits have been found are in the Sorrento Peninsula, which acted as a topographic barrier for the pyroclastic currents that entered the sea, and in the city of Naples (Fig. 5). Among the latter is Municipio Square, at a distance of >15\u00a0km from the vent in which decimeters-thick deposits have been found during archaeological excavations (Di Donato et al., 2018). Instead, the 79 CE pyroclastic fall deposits have been found in much more distal areas in the southern and particularly in southeastern directions (Fig. 9\n). In particular, by distal here we refer to the area between the limit of pyroclastic current propagation\/ballistic impact and the 5\u00a0cm isopach, while by ultra-distal we refer to the area between the 5\u00a0cm isopach and the furthest trace findings (cryptotephra). These are primary deposits that reach thicknesses of decimeter up to a meter, passing over the Sorrento Peninsula in the Salerno Bay (Fig. 1). They have been found offshore in marine cores, and show the presence of both the white and grey pumice layers (Sacchi et al., 2005, 2009; Insinga et al., 2008; Crocitti et al., 2018). At Pontecagnano near Salerno, the white and grey pumices stand on Roman plowing traces. The pyroclastic fall deposits have even been also found offshore in marine cores west of Calabria (Cosentino et al., 2017; Crocitti et al., 2018), in the Policastro Bay (Munno and Petrosino, 2004), and in the Taranto Bay (Cini Castagnoli et al., 1990; Crocitti et al., 2018; Pepe et al., 2018; Di Donato et al., 2019). At these localities, the eruption deposits occur as thin but significant primary tephra layers or cryptotephra, and are geochemically representative only of the most energetic phase corresponding to EU3f, i.e. the grey pumices. On the other hand, the grey pumices have been found in the northern and central part of Calabria on land (Pollino and Sila, respectively), in which they have a significant primary thickness of the order of centimeters (Galli and Scionti, 2006; Sevink et al., 2020). Other evidences of the grey pumices have been found as cryptotephra in marine cores in the Adriatic Sea (Jalali et al., 2018), in Sicily, in the Ionian Sea up to offshore Greece and Crete (Keller et al., 1978), and even in Greenland (Barbante et al., 2013; cf. Plunkett et al., 2022). On the whole, the dispersal area and main directions are indicative of the size and intensity of the 79 CE Plinian eruption, which heavily impacted proximal-to-distal areas (up to tens of km from the vent) under pyroclastic current dynamics, and proximal-to-ultradistal areas throughout the Mediterranean (up to thousands of km from the vent) under pyroclastic fallout and seasonal wind dynamics, particularly in the grey pumices phase. In Fig. 9, all evidences (as of today) of proximal-to-ultradistal tephra attributed to the 79 CE eruption are reported, while in ESMs 3 and 4 further details of medial-to-ultradistal tephras are specified (see also ESM 1). Fig. 9 also reports the 5\u00a0cm and 2\u00a0cm isopachs within the whole ash cloud represented by all trace findings of the grey pumices (T area). We recalculated the erupted volume for such pumices, with respect to the volumes reported in the literature by Sigurdsson et al. (1985) and Cioni et al. (2003), by adding the volumes relative to the areas between the 5\u00a0cm and 2\u00a0cm isopachs, and between the 2\u00a0cm isopach and T area. Roughly, the new calculation is the product of the GIS surface area and average deposit thichness (3.5\u00a0cm for the first area of about 11,000\u00a0km2, and assumed 2\u00a0mm for the second area of about 290,000\u00a0km2), which gives a minimum extra volume of erupted magma of 0.5\u00a0km3 corresponding to around 20% more than the volumes reported in the literature. The tables reported in ESM 3 and 4 show the state of the art on the location, thickness, juvenile chemistry (white vs. grey pumice), methodology, and general stratigraphic features of the 79 CE tephra, which have been found in the above mentioned localities, and have been described in the literature. These points, along with the new ones in Naples, Pollino, Velia, and Sicily, are all included in the integrated database for the distribution maps. The recent attributions of the tephra have been based on convincing geochemical data and chronostratigraphic constraints, with the remarkable exception of the tephra Z-1 of Keller et al. (1978) found in the most distal sites of the Ionian Sea. This tephra was originally attributed to the \u201cPomici di Avellino\u201d eruption (c. 3.9\u00a0ka), and for sure it is of Vesuvian origin for its XRF composition, which is not suitable for a confident individual correlation but enough for a convincing identification of the volcanic source. In fact, based on its stratigraphic position above the tephra Z-2 of the Minoan eruption of Santorini (c. 3.6\u00a0ka), the attribution of Z-1 was reappraised to the stratigraphically consistent 79 CE eruption (Wulf, 2000). Future geochemical analyses on samples from this tephra, and from others found in some lacustrine basins in Puglia and Basilicata regions and the Adriatic Sea will allow a precise provenance attribution, and consequently a refined distribution map of the ultra-distal deposits.\n\n\n7\nMagma chamber\nThe magma chamber and the pre-eruptive conditions of the 79 CE eruption have been studied by integration of petrological and stratigraphic investigations. A distinctive feature in the stratigraphy of the 79 CE pyroclastic deposits is a marked change of chemical composition and particle density passing from the white to the grey pumices (Carey and Sigurdsson, 1987; Cioni et al., 1995). The white pumices are K-phonolitic and have a homogeneous density distribution with a mode at about 600\u00a0kg\/m3. In contrast, the grey pumices are K-tephri-phonolitic and have a more heterogeneous density distribution with higher modes at about 700\u00a0kg\/m3 and 1100\u00a0kg\/m3, and show broader density distributions with coarse tails (Gurioli et al., 2005b; Shea et al., 2012). Such variations are correlated to variations of the column height and magma discharge rate (Carey and Sigurdsson, 1987; Sigurdsson et al., 1990; Shea et al., 2011), and all have been ascribed to a compositional zonation of the 79 CE magma chamber (Sigurdsson et al., 1990; Cioni et al., 1995; Cioni, 2000; Scaillet et al., 2008). A study of the pyroclastic deposits of the 79 CE eruption was conducted by Cioni et al. (1995). This study allowed reconstructing the thermal, compositional and isotopic features of the pre-eruptive magma, as well as investigating syn-eruptive mixing among different magmas and recognizing the variability of the magma batches feeding the chamber. The authors suggested that during the different phases of the eruption about 25\u201330% of magma was erupted as white k-phonolitic pumices, while c.a. 75\u201370% as grey k-tephry-phonolitic pumices. The total volume of the erupted magma was estimated at 4.4\u00a0km3: 1\u00a0km3 as white pumices, 2.7\u00a0km3 as grey pumices, and 0.7\u00a0km3 as phreatomagmatic products (Sigurdsson et al., 1985; Civetta et al., 1991). These early works already suggested that the white pumices resulted from tapping of progressively deeper magma with a body at T\u00a0=\u00a0850\u2013900\u00a0\u00b0C that represents a pre-existing tephritic-phonolitic, crystal-rich magma reservoir, possibly a residue from the previous \u201cAvellino\u201d Plinian eruption (c. 3.9\u00a0ka; Sevink et al., 2020). Moreover, this magma body consisted of distinct layers. The basal \u201cgrey\u201d magma was formed by syn-eruptive mixing between the phonolitic white magma, mafic cumulates and a crystal poor, phono-tefritic grey magma (Cioni et al., 1995). The periodic arrival of hot mafic magma batches was considered the main engine for the growth of the 79 CE magma chamber. This mafic magma had k-tephritic to k-basanitic composition, homogeneous Sr isotopic composition (87Sr\/86Sr of c.a. 0.70729), high temperature (T\u00a0=\u00a01100\u00a0\u00b0C) and was characterized by high volatile contents (ca. 2\u00a0wt% H2O, Cl, F and S), low viscosity (10\u201320\u00a0Pa\u00b7s) and relatively low densities (c.a. 2500\u00a0kg\/m3). Cioni et al. (1995) suggested an ellipsoidal or cylindrical chamber geometry and a minimum volume of c.a. 5\u00a0km3 for the magma chamber, taking into account for c.a. 1\u00a0km3 of unerupted mafic cumulates. The minimum, vertical extent of the chamber was suggested to be between 1.5 and 1.0\u00a0km. Marianelli et al. (1995) analyzed melt inclusions (MIs) in olivine and diopside crystals from pyroclasts of the 79 CE eruption. MIs were found to be relatively primitive, silica undersaturated, basaltic to tephritic compositions and were considered as representative of the composition of magma batches that supplied the Vesuvius Plinian and sub Plinian magma chamber(s) from the 3.9\u00a0ka Avellino eruption to the 472 CE Pollena eruption. Based on these reconstructions, the 79 CE magma chamber chemically evolved to form a two-fold layering consisting of a highly evolved body at T\u00a0=\u00a0850\u2013900\u00a0\u00b0C, overlying a less evolved, homogeneous body of greater mass (1\u20132\u00a0km3) and temperature of c.a. 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. However, the most \u201cprimitive\u201d magma batches supplying the chamber were characterized by much higher temperature (< 1200\u00a0\u00b0C). Balcone-Boissard et al. (2008) focused on the pumice- fallout deposits that were emitted during the 79 CE eruption and which represent the 80% of the erupted magma (Cioni et al., 1995). The authors performed a systematic sampling of a representative section of the fallout deposit in the Terzigno quarry, where six units crop out. The authors found that melt inclusion and matrix glass compositions in both the white pumices and the grey pumices define two distinct, continuous differentiation trends. These trends are characterized by enrichment in Na2O and CaO and depletion in K2O at approximately constant Al2O3 content. Moreover, SiO2, Fe2O3 and MgO vs Na2O contents for the white pumices and grey pumices diverge. These data were interpreted as the evidence of syn-eruptive magma mingling between the white and the grey magmas during ascent in the feeder conduit and not in the magma chamber as suggested by Cioni et al. (1995). The authors performed several estimates of H2O contents in MIs using the \u201cby difference method\u201d and compared their results with those available from literatures and obtained by using different techniques (e.g. FTIR, SIMS). In products from the 79 CE eruption, sanidine displays the most differentiated MIs composition and has H2O contents ranging from 3.5 to 6.5\u00a0wt%. Major elements content of MIs in pyroxene spans a wider range, which extends toward a less differentiated melt composition. Moreover, MIs feature H2O contents between 5 and 1\u00a0wt%. Finally, MIs in leucite crystals display the lowest H2O content (0.7\u20132.6\u00a0wt%), which is consistent with the late, syn-eruptive crystallization of leucite. Based on their work and on data from literature, Balcone-Boissard et al. (2008) suggested that white pumice magma stored in the upper part of the chamber was saturated at pressures of c.a. 185\u00a0MPa considering 5\u00a0wt% of H2O. Similar results were obtained by considering Cl solubility. They calculated that the white pumice magma chamber was emplaced at c.a. 7.5\u00a0km depth, in agreement with Scaillet et al. (2008), and suggested it had a vertical extent <500\u00a0m. The grey pumice reservoir extended from just below the white pumice reservoir. No constraint was given on the vertical extension of this latter. Assuming that fractional crystallization, dissolution-regrowth as well as recharge and mixing occurred before the 79 CE eruption, the timescale of such processes can be determined by investigating diffusion profiles within individual crystals. Morgan et al. (2006) presented data on sanidine crystals from the 79 CE eruption. Crystals display abrupt changes in Ba concentration that were suggested to be caused by magma chamber recharge events prior to the eruption. Based on the results of their analyses the authors identified three distinct recharge events, the most recent of which occurred 20\u00a0years before the eruption. Given the relatively large uncertainty, this time information is very close to the time of the 62 CE earthquake. For such a reason, Morgan et al. (2006) suggested that significant magmatic recharge occurred around the time of the earthquake. At least two more recharging phases were identified 30 and 80\u00a0years before the 79 CE eruption, suggesting that episodic recharge occurred at Vesuvius in the last century prior to this Plinian eruption.\n\n\n8\nModern geophysical observations and past evidences\nSomma-Vesuvius is a stratovolcano consisting of a central cone, Vesuvius, grown after the 79 CE eruption, and an external older caldera, Mt. Somma. The cone as we know today was not formed yet at the time of the eruption. At the Roman time indeed, only one, truncated and asymmetrical volcano, without an intracaldera cone, was present, as shown by the Roman painting of the \u201cLove of Venus and Mars\u201d, now at \u201cMuseo Archeologico Nazionale\u201d in Naples. In this mythological picture, the Somma-Vesuvius caldera (at the time called V\u0115s\u016dv\u012dus, Vesevius, Vesvius, or Vesbius) is visible on the background where a deep notch probably cut the southeastern caldera rim, showing the stratified structure of the Mt. Somma caldera walls. The new cone grew discontinuously (with minor summit collapses) during periods of open conduit, persistent activity (both strombolian and effusive), the last of which happened recently in 1631\u20131944 (Arrighi et al., 2001). The NE-SW tectonic lineament controlling the activity of Vesuvius is in accordance with the general lineament trend of the southern Apennine (Cassano and La Torre, 1987). The occurrence of normal fault-like sliding along the contact zones confirms the extensional tectonic regime in the area (Montone et al., 1995), while radial and en-echelon fractures are related to the volcanic inflations and caldera collapse (Tramparulo et al., 2018). The Vesuvius dynamics has been interpreted as joint effects of gravitational sliding and extensional tectonic stress occurring at the contact between different lithological units (De Natale et al., 2000; Lanari et al., 2002; Borgia et al., 2005). Static deformation measurements performed by terrestrial and satellite techniques over the last 50\u00a0years evidence a current subsidence of the central cone of few mm\/yr (e.g., Bonasia et al., 1985; Lanari et al., 2002). The subsidence of the central cone agrees with the local seismicity clustered below the cone, possibly driven by gravitational stress due to the weight of the topographic relief and the sedimentary substratum (De Natale et al., 2000; Borgia et al., 2005; D'Auria et al., 2014). Subsidence larger than 2\u00a0mm\/yr is also found at regional scale, as a result of the sediment compaction of the Campanian Plain (Lanari et al., 2002). However, paleontological and petrochemical analyses since the last glacial era constrain 5\u00a0mm\/yr uplift, suggesting that the volcanic component prevailed over the long-term subsidence of the entire Campanian Plain (Marturano et al., 2011, 2013). Little was known about shallow crustal structure beneath Vesuvius until the \u201890s. The knowledge of the internal structure of Vesuvius has increased in the last decades, after several active seismic experiments carried out at Vesuvius, disclosing the strong velocity heterogeneity of its shallow structure (see details in Principe et al., 1987; Zollo et al., 1996a, 1996b, 2002; Gasparini et al., 1998; De Natale et al., 2000, 2004; Auger et al., 2001; Lomax et al., 2001; Di Stefano and Chiarabba, 2002; Scarpa et al., 2002; De Natale et al., 2006; D'Auria et al., 2014). A teleseismic tomography was obtained by merging seismic data recorded by the Italian Seismic Network located on the southern Apennines with stations deployed in a temporary broad-band experiment around Vesuvius volcano (De Gori et al., 2001). A sharp transition at 10\u00a0km depth from a high-velocity to a low-velocity medium was already inferred by Zollo et al. (1996a), identified as a discontinuity consistent with the occurrence of magmatic melt within a high-permeability host rock. The large-scale tomography by De Gori et al. (2001) infers an almost continuous high-velocity body in the upper mantle, interpreted as the signature of the Adriatic lithosphere subducting westward toward the back-arc Tyrrhenian basin. Therefore, the low-velocity anomaly beneath Vesuvius evidenced by Zollo et al. (1996a), and later by Auger et al. (2001), is located above this high-velocity zone dipping in the mantle, and De Gori et al. (2001) suggest that magma is generated by the subducting slab at depths 15\u201330\u00a0km. The complex interaction among the volcanic edifice, fluids circulation and seismicity are matter of study to depict the recent, but also the past, dynamics of Vesuvius and the relation among the hydrothermal\/magmatic systems. Recently, Ricco et al. (2021) evidenced a close relation between episodic seismic swarms and ground tilting. Also, episodes of surface deformation are related to thermal pulses of fluids, due to hot injections within the deep carbonate basement. All these geophysical studies shed light on the past behaviour of Vesuvius, as they are the result of the volcanic activity through the centuries. Bouguer gravity anomalies were computed to infer the depth of the basement at larger scale (down to 2.3\u00a0km in the western side of the volcano; Santacroce, 1987). A complete reconstruction of the top of the carbonate basement was carried out by Cella et al. (2007), evidencing an annular volume of dense rocks around Mt. Somma extending down to the basement. A minimum depth of about 3\u00a0km for the top of the reservoir was inferred using mineral equilibrium of metamorphic carbonate ejecta (Barberi et al., 1981). Civetta et al. (1991) found evidence from xenolithic ejecta of the top of the chamber to be located within the Mesozoic calcareous sequence, at a depth ranging from 3 and 5\u00a0km. Scaillet et al. (2008) provided evidence, from experimental phase equilibria from the main explosive events at Vesuvius, that the reservoirs migrated from 7 to 8\u00a0km to 3\u20134\u00a0km depth between the 79 CE and 472\u00a0CE events. Volcanological and archaeological studies in the Roman towns provided information regarding phenomena preceding the 79 CE eruption. The eruption caught the inhabitants in their every-day life, suggesting different response to early seismic events and ground deformation as recorded by historical accounts and archaeological excavations. Seismic activity continued during the eruption as reported in the Pliny's second letter, and that likely occurred through the first destabilizations of the magma chamber, also in analogy with the eruption of Mount St. Helens observed in 1980 (Scandone and Giacomelli, 2001; Scandone et al., 2019). Archaeological sources document several water crises in Pompeii. Civil aqueducts have ceased to supply water due to the change in slope of the slight inclination typical of these Roman artefacts. The uplift had compensated the gentle slope (Marturano, 2008). A minimum 30\u00a0cm uplift was documented on the flanks of Vesuvius, at about 10\u00a0km from vent, prior to the eruption (Keenan-Jones, 2015). Russo et al. (1997) performed one of the first attempts to simulate the mechanical response of the local crust to the action of the pressurization of the magmatic source at Vesuvius. These models are aimed at evaluating the current hazard level at Vesuvius and understanding the conditions of the plumbing system of the 79 CE eruption. The numerical models by means of the Finite Element Modelling (FEM) technique were used to evaluate the stability of the reservoir's walls, considering the slopes of the volcano and the regional stress (Russo et al., 1997). The reservoir characteristics are chosen according to the conditions of the 79 CE eruption and the medium includes the basement evidenced by Zollo et al. (1996a). Simulations are performed with several spherical and ellipsoidal reservoirs with top at 2\u00a0km b.s.l. whose volumes range from 0.1\u00a0km3 to 4\u00a0km3. Considering an overpressure amounting to 10\u00a0MPa, surface displacements of the order of cm were obtained. Also, all the results show that the shallow reservoir is below its critical conditions for gravitational collapse of the Vesuvius flanks. In a second study, Russo and Giberti (2004) evidenced that the effect of the rigid structure and the carbonate basement is to focus the deformation field around the summit area of the volcano. Further simulations by FEM models were carried out by Meo et al. (2008) to analyze in greater detail the impact of topography and crustal layering (e.g., the carbonate basement) on the ground deformations with comparisons between homogenous and heterogeneous media. The 3D topography deviates surface displacement patterns from the axial symmetry of the spherical and\/or vertical ellipsoidal reservoirs employed. Recently, Tammaro et al. (2021) developed new FEM models accounting for the 3D elastic structure as deployed from the tomography, along with the real topography. The reservoir is placed at 2\u00a0km depth, and it is compatible with the tomography resolution that did not constrain low-velocity zones larger than 0.5\u00a0km. As in Meo et al. (2008), significant differences respect to flat and homogeneous modelling are obtained as result of the simulations. These models highlight the complex interpretation of geodetic signals at volcanic areas in general and at Vesuvius in particular, due to the relevant topography and the highly heterogeneous local crust. To conclude, a strong interaction among seismic and ground deformation data, along with petrological and historical data are needed at those monitoring active volcanoes capable to give, in particular, Plinian eruptions.\n\n\n9\nThe climate at the time of the 79 CE eruption\nIn recent years, the impact produced by large volcanic eruptions on climate and environment at regional to global scale is a matter of careful investigation and discussion (e.g. Sigl et al., 2015; Muschitiello et al., 2017). In this section, the climate condition at the time of (or close to) the 79 CE eruption is investigated, not only to detect possible climatic anomalies potentially related to the effect of the eruption, but also to investigate how local climate might have played a role in the following environmental recovery. For instance, thick debris flow deposits due to remobilization of the primary pyroclastic deposits of the 79 CE eruption are common around Vesuvius, as a consequence of heavy rains, at least locally. There also are thick sequences of these deposits even in Amalfi and Positano, at about 50\u00a0km from vent (Fig. 10\n; see also Cinque and Robustelli, 2009). Such debris flows could have had a high frequency, from months to years. On the other hand, compared to the other three Plinian eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius, the 79 CE eruption is the only to have the major axis of tephra dispersal elongated in southeast direction (toward Crete), which can give information of specific atmospheric circulation at that time related to some prevailing conditions (e.g., seasonal impact; Rolandi et al., 2007). It is useful to remember that the Roman time has been traditionally considered a period of general \u201cbenign\u201d climate (the so-called \u201cRoman Warm Period\u201d, e.g., Lamb, 1995, or \u201cRoman Climatic Optimum\u201d, e.g., Harper, 2017). The \u201cRoman Climatic Optimum\u201d lasted between ca. 200 BCE and 450 CE (McCormick et al., 2012; Harper, 2017), and was followed by a phase of climatic deterioration during the Late Antiquity (e.g. McCormick et al., 2012; B\u00fcntgen et al., 2016; Zanchetta et al., 2020). Starting from the analyses of many proxy records, McCormick et al. (2012) reported favorable and exceptionally stable conditions across the Roman Empire from ca. 100 BCE to ca. 200 CE, which, they inferred, fostered the Roman Empire's unparalleled rise. However, the climatic signal during this period is organized regionally following the main atmospheric modes of the North Atlantic and Mediterranean (Dermody et al., 2012), making general statements on the climatic condition to the whole Empire probably not applicable. However, McCormick et al. (2012) highlight that in the heart of the Roman Empire, that is Italy, there is a substantial absence of significant studies on this period. This does not mean that studies have not been performed, but their chronological anchoring and resolution are not adequate for the purposes of this kind of research. In addition, many archives were investigated with pollen and\/or proxies, which are sensitive to human impact giving preeminently environmental information instead of genuine climatic information (e.g. Mensing et al., 2015). The situation in the last years has surely changed but not substantially improved. In particular, it would be fundamental to have archives which directly contain the physical evidence of the 79 CE eruption (i.e. in form of visible tephra layer or as cryptotephra), which could also avoid misalignment related to the use of different age model (Zanchetta et al., 2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2019). However, this evidence is rare and when the case is, the records available do not possess significant resolution. Aware of these limitations we select some archives in the western Mediterranean, which can be representative (in a very broad sense) of the condition prevailing on the Tyrrhenian side of Italy (Fig. 11\n). Bini et al. (2020) investigated the relation between flood events recognized in archaeological sites in northern Tuscany and hydrological condition inferred from stable isotopes and trace elements on speleothems collected in the Apuan Alps caves (Renella and Corchia, Fig. 11e,f). According to these authors, the very end of the I century B.C. and almost of the whole I century A.D. are characterized by an increase of precipitation associated to evidences of increased fluvial floods, which is substantially mimicked by the historical reconstruction of the Tiber river flood (e.g. Aldrete, 2007). They suggest that this may have corresponded to a phase of Negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, favoring penetration of the Westerlies and cyclones from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean during autumn and winter months. However, the speleothems proxy indicates for the very end of the I century A.D. a progressive return to drier condition even if not particularly prominent. This is not perfectly coincident with some proposed reconstruction of the NAO index (Fig. 11), even if this can be considered within the errors of the Apuan Alps speleothems age models. As shown in Fig. 11e,f, the year 79 CE occurred during the trend of decreasing precipitation. As indicated by the sea surface temperature (SST) record, obtained using alkenones in the sediment of the core KSGC-31, average annual temperature seems relatively stable during this period, and the Roman Period does not stand as particularly prominent phase of high temperature (Jalali et al., 2016, Fig. 11c). Summer temperatures reconstructed from lake Verdarolo on the Northern Apennine (Samartin et al., 2017) indicate a cooler condition during the first part of the Roman Period, which terminates at the end of the I century A.D. with a slow increase in temperature. The oxygen isotope composition of the shell of the planktonic foraminifera Globigerodinoides ruber (\u03b418O in core SW104, Fig. 11d) in the Gulf of Gaeta (Fig. 11) shows during the similar period higher values potentially indicating lower temperature, and an interesting trend toward lower values during the time corresponding, according to the age model, to the occurrence of the eruption (Margaritelli et al., 2016). However, the interpretation of this record is ambiguous. The isotopic signal could indeed be related to changes in local salinity (i.e. higher contribution of freshwater) or to an increase in temperature at time of shell calcification (or both). For comparison, in Fig. 11a are reported the high-resolution dendroclimatological study of the summer temperature in central Europe (B\u00fcntgen et al., 2016). The error associated to this kind of study probably allows, with a low degree (decadal) of uncertainty, to place the 79 CE eruption during a period of progressive reduction of temperature at the end of the first maximum warming of the \u201cRoman Climatic Optimum\u201d (Fig. 11). However, this cannot be mechanically translated in higher summer temperatures over the Mediterranean region; indeed, Verdarolo and core SW104 seems to suggest an opposite trend. Overall, the selection of data from Fig. 11 clearly shows inconsistencies and divergent trends. Speleothems from the Apuan Alps indicate that the 79 CE eruption occurred during a transition to a period of progressive (even if not extreme) drying; whereas \u03b418O values from Gulf of Gaeta suggest a possible decrease in sea surface salinity (i.e. increase in freshwater input) and\/or transition to trend of temperature increase. Whereas the Gulf of Lyon SST does not show temperature change (Jalali et al., 2016). However, some of these differences could be probably only a result of discrepancies between age models. It is also important to note that proxies displayed in Fig. 11 are indicative of different climatic parameters like precipitation (for speleothems in the Apuan Alps these should be mostly a winter precipitation signal, e.g. Bini et al., 2019), temperature (SST obtained from alkenone in the Mediterranean Sea is considered to be close to mean average temperature, e.g. Sicre et al., 2016), and changes in sea salinity, which can roughly be related to changes in hydrological budget. Despite the very common use of terms to indicate the Roman Climate, a clear and objective picture of climate over the Italian peninsula during roman times is still far to be obtained from the available proxy records. The same applies if we want to understand the possible climatic and (more probable) environmental impact of the eruption at regional scale.\n\n\n10\nNumerical modelling of explosive eruptions\n\n10.1\nModelling of explosive eruptions: General aspects and the 79 CE simulation\nIn this section, we review the available numerical models that have been used to describe the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius over the years. Given the complexity of modelling explosive eruptions and the evolution of the models particularly in recent years, we briefly introduce the general problem of physical modelling of such eruptions (see Neri et al., 2022 for a comprehensive review). This will provide a measure of the great development that was prompted by the study of the 79 CE eruption in the field of numerical modelling of volcanic eruptions. The ascent of magma toward the ground surface, its fragmentation and emission into the atmosphere as a mixture of hot gas and solid particles involve a variety of thermodynamic processes. Outside the volcano, the solid particles (after fragmentation) can eventually decouple from the volcanic plume and fall to the ground, where they can form widespread fallout deposits that mantle extended areas around the vent, and all along the direction of prevailing winds. On the other hand, partial or total collapses of the eruption column, or the failure of a volcanic dome can cause the development of pyroclastic currents, which can quickly propagate down the slope of the volcano. These currents are capable of overcoming obstacles (both topographic and urban) and reach distances of tens of km. The dynamics of the flow depends on several features including, in particular, not only the relative proportion between gas and particles but also the interaction with topographic and urban obstacles (Sulpizio et al., 2014, and references therein). This extraordinary complexity combines with our limited capacity to observe and directly measure many of these phenomena, affecting our ability to model explosive eruptions. It is just to imagine all complexities, but at the same time the investigation needs, which are related to a large and so impacting event like the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, to understand how such studies should be systematic. To overcome all these difficulties, a common practice is to separate and address one single process at a time, identifying its driving mechanisms and governing equations. Depending on the processes considered, different time- or length-scales can be relevant. Regardless of the process considered, model setup and validation require input parameters and, commonly, specific assumptions concerning the natural system. This has promoted specific field studies and observations aimed at collecting the data needed to set up and constrain model parameters and assumptions. All the stratigraphic and petrological studies described in the first half of this work are intended as the actual constraints of an explosive eruption (products), the 79 CE one, that already happened. Then, the numerical modelling makes a full circle, allowing us to better understand what might have happened during the eruption (processes). Despite these difficulties, the need to provide a quantitative assessment of volcanic hazards gave a strong motivation to develop models capable of describing specific features of volcanic eruptions. Vesuvius has always been a natural target for these modelling efforts, given the high volcanic risk, the symbolic relevance of the Roman towns buried in 79 CE, and due to the large amount of information available about its volcanic history. First attempts to model explosive activity at Vesuvius began as early as 1988, with the description of ash fallout during the 79 CE eruption (Macedonio et al., 1988). Considering the eruptive phases responsible for the deposition of the white and grey pumices (EU2f and EU3f), Macedonio et al. (1988) applied an advection-diffusion model describing the distal ash fallout, based on a continuity equation for mass concentration that considers wind field, atmospheric diffusion and gravity settling (input parameters in ESM 5). The same model was later applied to perform a first assessment of the hazard posed by ash accumulation. The model output describes the total particle concentration at the ground and, given particle density and grain size distribution, the corresponding deposit thickness. The model validation featured a comparison between calculated (Macedonio et al., 1988) and measured (Sigurdsson et al., 1985) deposit thicknesses at different locations. A good correspondence was found for the grey phase, for which a better reconstruction of the grain size and componentry distribution was available. Also, the comparison between the calculated and observed (Lirer et al., 1973) grain size distribution resulting at different locations provided a good match for the grey pumice deposit. A complementary modelling study was carried out within a given eruptive scenario corresponding to the maximum expected event, and exploring the effects of wind variability (Barberi et al., 1990). On the other hand, Macedonio et al. (1990) explored the possible outcome of future events at Vesuvius, considering three different eruptive scenarios, ranging from small-size \u201cultra-strombolian\u201d to large scale Plinian. The authors first assessed the eruption column behaviour based on the plume theory (Wilson and Walker, 1987). The theory describes the changes of the eruption column properties (density, temperature, velocity and radius) at different heights as a function of input parameters, which include (among others) the column radius at the vent, the gas weight fraction and mass eruption rate (ESM 5). The authors used the plume theory to constrain the vent radiuses and corresponding column heights that are expected for a given mass eruption rate. In this case, there is no direct comparison with data from real observations, but modelling results show the effect of column heights on particle distribution on the ground, especially when the more variable summer winds are considered. It was found that as column height increases, the maximum distance reached by heavier particles is reduced, while isomass lines pertaining to lighter particles extend further. The same model was later applied by Cioni et al. (2003) to perform a probabilistic assessment of the hazard related to ash fallout. Macedonio et al. (1990) also accounted for column collapse and pyroclastic current propagation. At the time, however, specific models to describe pyroclastic current propagation and deposition were not available, and Macedonio et al. (1990) limit their considerations to an estimate of maximum runout distance. Results were based on the energy cone method (Malin and Sheridan, 1982; Sheridan and Malin, 1983), even though Macedonio et al. (1990) highlighted the oversimplified approach of such method. A first description of the dynamics of pyroclastic currents along the slopes of Vesuvius was carried out only a few years later by Dobran et al. (1994). In this work, two different models were employed. A first 1-D model (Papale and Dobran, 1993) was used to simulate magma ascent along the volcanic conduit, in order to compute vent conditions based on mass eruption rate, conduit length, magma chamber temperature and pressure, magma composition, gas and crystal content, and grain size after fragmentation. The outputs of this first model constrained the conditions at the vent, which were then used as input parameters (ESM 6) for a second transient model, which was meant to describe the evolution of the eruptive mixture once injected into the atmosphere within a 2-D axisymmetric domain (Dobran et al., 1993). In this second model, the eruptive material was described as a multiphase mixture of solid particles and water vapor, entering a standard atmosphere composed by air. Both gas components (vapor-air multispecies) were assumed to follow the ideal gas law, while the solid phase was made by spherical particles of equal diameter (100\u00a0\u03bcm). The model accounted for mechanical and thermal disequilibrium between gas and solid particles, described the effects of particle-particle interactions, and implemented a turbulent sub-grid scale model to represent gas turbulence. In their application to Vesuvius, Dobran et al. (1994) considered three different scenarios referred to large-, medium- and small-scale events. The large-scale event was tailored to represent the 79 CE eruption. The authors also explored the effect of different volcano slopes, although under the simplifying assumption of axial symmetry. Two topographic profiles were implemented, one across Mt. Somma along the northern sector of the volcano, and a smoother one, representative of the southern sector. Performed simulations described the collapse of the volcanic column and the generation of pyroclastic currents that quickly swept the computational domain. For the considered largest scenario, simulated pyroclastic currents were capable of overcoming the topographic obstacle characterizing the northern profile. A coarse model validation was carried out through a comparison with volcanological evidence and historical accounts, suggesting similar runout distances and timing for the pyroclastic current propagation, and confirming that the currents could indeed overcome Mt. Somma. The modelling results of Dobran et al. (1994) were later analyzed to explore the impact of pyroclastic currents on inhabited areas (Baxter et al., 1998; Doronzo and Dellino, 2011). These authors focused on the evolution of selected flow variables that are found to be critical for human survival (in particular, ash concentration\u00a0>\u00a00.1\u00a0kg\/m3, temperature\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0\u00b0C) or building resistance (dynamic pressure\u00a0>\u00a05\u201310\u00a0kPa). As field constraints, the findings of numerous charred woods in EU3pf at Cava Pozzelle and in EU3pftot at Cava di Pollena, and decimeter-sized lithic fragments in EU4pf at Pompeii indicate a high thermo-mechanical impact of the pyroclastic currents in proximal to medial reaches. Results showed that pyroclastic currents generated by large-scale events like the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, can cause destruction and unsurvivable conditions along their entire path, and within minutes from their generation after column\/caldera collapse. Also, minutes or less is the order of magnitude for the emplacement of depositional flow units (lamina, layer, bed; see Doronzo, 2012; Roche, 2015; Mart\u00ed et al., 2019). In case of slower flows (i.e., smaller eruptions or in the presence of obstacles), air entrainment may lower the flow temperature below a critical threshold, at distances greater than a few km from the vent. Ash concentration in the areas reached by the flow is always to be considered as unsurvivable, therefore the flow runout is a reliable indicator for the hazard associated with respiratory problems. Also, the model of Dobran et al. (1993) was further refined to introduce the description of solid particles with different sizes and properties (Neri and Macedonio, 1996), and to account for terrain roughness and its effects on flow turbulence and runout (Todesco et al., 2002). The application to Vesuvius confirmed the expected high impact of the pyroclastic currents, and highlighted the transient nature of the simulated hazard variables. In particular, results showed the complex dynamics that leads to significant pressure changes and peaks of the dynamic pressure, regardless of the steady discharge rate fixed at the vent (Esposti et al., 2002). Simulations also showed that even in case of short-lasting feeding (i.e., with discharge from vent interrupted after 2\u00a0min), the currents were capable to reach urban settlements around Vesuvius, highlighting the inertial behaviour of such currents (Todesco et al., 2002; Doronzo et al., 2022). A substantial advancement was achieved by Neri et al. (2007) and Esposti Ongaro et al. (2007, 2008), who implemented a parallel code for the simulation of transient dispersal of pyroclasts into the atmosphere. The implementation of the parallel code on a supercomputer allowed the simulation of 3-D eruptive scenarios featuring the real topography of the volcano. The application to Vesuvius described a medium-scale sub-Plinian eruption, and showed the role of column collapse regimes on the generation and impact of the pyroclastic currents (Neri et al., 2007; Esposti Ongaro et al., 2008; see Fig. 12\n). Such application gives a clear idea of the importance of eruptive dynamics on pyroclastic current generation, transport, and emplacement, i.e. the density contrast between the flow and atmosphere is not the only driving mechanism in explosive eruptions (cf. Trolese et al., 2019; Doronzo et al., 2022). Ongoing research is also considering simpler models that allow a statistically sound assessment of volcanic hazard and associated uncertainty (Tierz et al., 2018; Tadini et al., 2021). Future developments of numerical modelling will aim at improving the description of the physical phenomena that take place during explosive eruptions in general, as the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius had a number of similarities with other eruptions at monitoring volcanic areas, such as for example Mount St. Helens, Pinatubo, Tenerife, Fogo, and others worldwide (see next sections).\n\n\n10.2\nRecent developments and future perspectives\nIn this section, we compiled a set of information to complement the recent advances that are ongoing in the modelling of explosive eruptions. From the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, we have learned how to pass from \u201creading\u201d pyroclastic deposits of past eruptions (products) to implement equations to explain the processes. It is indeed a unique opportunity to use this well-known eruption to extend the comprehensive approach that we propose to explosive volcanoes in general. An effort was done here in that sense, considering the substantial improvement of the models in recent years. Concerning volcanic plumes, maximum height and time-averaged vertical profiles of density, entrainment, gas and solid mass fraction, plume bending and radius, temperature, and velocity have recently been focused on (Costa et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2016a). Such studies have shown that the entrainment processes are of paramount importance to accurately relate mass eruption rate with maximum plume height. When simulating Plinian eruptions with mass eruption rate\u00a0>\u00a0107\u00a0kg\/s, the complex buoyancy reversal process undergoing from the crater, up to the suspended region 1\u20135\u00a0km above (Neri and Dobran, 1994; Suzuki et al., 2016b; Costa et al., 2018), is difficult to capture with 1-D models, and a better understanding of the process is needed to relate eruption source parameters with total\/partial column collapse, and with the dynamics of the buoyant part of the volcanic column (Degruyter and Bonadonna, 2013; Koyaguchi and Suzuki, 2018; Koyaguchi et al., 2018; Trolese et al., 2019; Aubry et al., 2021). Some of the existing modern 3-D models for volcanic plumes and pyroclastic currents have been presented in that sense, in particular SK-3D (Suzuki et al., 2005), ATHAM (Herzog et al., 2003), ASHEE (Cerminara et al., 2016a, 2016b), and PDAC (Neri et al., 2003). Other existing 3-D models are, for example, MFIX (e.g., Dufek and Bergantz, 2007), Plume-SPH (Cao et al., 2017), and Ansys Fluent (Doronzo et al., 2011), which have been experimentally-validated (see Sulpizio et al., 2014). In general terms, the governing equations for mass, momentum and energy conservation can be solved in their full transient 3-D shape, or averaged horizontally and temporally to obtain integral 1-D models, or averaged vertically to obtain shallow water models. Alternatively, only some of these equations can be solved, using observations and one-way coupling, like in Volcanic Ash Transport and Dispersion Models (VATDM), where atmospheric conditions and mass conservation are used for the transport of volcanic ash and gas. The degree of accuracy, resolution and dynamic phenomena that is possible to resolve depends on computational resources and performances, the accuracy of empirical relationships obtained from laboratory and large-scale experiments, the knowledge and observation of the volcano, of its products and dynamical behaviour, above and below ground (Sulpizio et al., 2014; Esposti Ongaro et al., 2020). To model the dynamics of a volcanic column in explosive eruptions, the first step is to define the eruption source parameters produced by underground dynamics, the magma chamber, and the volcanic conduit. In that sense, we did an effort in this multidisciplinary work to provide all needed information about the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius. This input information can define the so-called independent eruption source parameters (Trolese et al., 2019), for which it has recently been published a database (Aubry et al., 2021), and which are: mass eruption rate, magma temperature, mass fraction of exsolved gases in the magma, magma overpressure, grain-size, density and shape distribution. Other parameters are needed increasing the accuracy of the simulation, such as the specific heat distribution of the pyroclasts (Moitra et al., 2018), the initial presence of ice and rocks above the volcanic conduit, or the chemical and petrological properties of the fragmented magma (see section 7). It should be kept in mind that all of these parameters typically change in time and space, starting from the mass eruption rate, which is one of the most important parameters (cf. Carey and Sigurdsson, 1987). Recently, remote sensing techniques have enabled the observation of such variations (Marzano et al., 2020; Freret-Lorgeril et al., 2021; see also next section). When only the subaerial dynamics is of interest, different eruption source parameters are used to model the eruption dynamics. For example, inputs for pyroclastic current vertical profiles can be reconstructed from large-scale experiments (Doronzo and Dellino, 2011; Sulpizio et al., 2014; Shimizu et al., 2021; Cerminara et al., 2021; Brosch et al., 2021), while for ash transport and dispersion maximum plume height and vertical profiles of ash components should be prescribed (Suzuki, 1983; Pfeiffer et al., 2005; Devenish and Cerminara, 2018; Aubry et al., 2019; Folch et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2021). One way to prescribe these vertical profiles (to be used as input for VATDM simulations) is to average results from 3-D numerical simulations in time and horizontally in space. In Fig. 13\n, the averaged vertical profiles of pyroclasts going into the atmosphere from a volcanic plume are shown based on the 79 CE eruption scenario for Vesuvius, simulated by using the ASHEE code (Cerminara et al., 2016a, 2016b). The approach enables dispersion models to have an initial condition taking into account of the turbulent multiphase non-equilibrium phenomena occurring in the volcanic plume. Modern High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures enables the numerical simulation of explosive eruptions with unprecedented resolution. Volcanic eruptions are multiscale. Indeed, the smallest scale is of the order of the finest ash particles, and of the smallest turbulent eddy developing in the column, i.e. 1\u00a0\u03bcm. On the other hand, the largest scale to be captured is of the order of hundreds (when not thousands) of km. Even if we still are abundantly far from being able to numerically solve for all of these scales, modern supercomputers and codes enable to reach numerical simulations with hundreds of millions to billions of degrees of freedom. A number of physical processes and mathematical problems are involved in the long road to understanding and reproducing as accurately as possible the 3-D dynamics of volcanic plumes, pyroclastic currents, and ash dispersion. The presence of multiscale dynamics and complex topographies makes discretization far from being trivial, even if modern developments in numerical analysis and information technology allow to deal with it. Since it is impossible to resolve all the relevant scales, subgrid models are necessary to close the equations for turbulence, like LES and dynamic LES models (Moin et al., 1991; Cerminara et al., 2016a, 2016b). The strong advantage of dynamic LES models is that they do not need any empirical parameter (like the Smagorinsky coefficient), as the equation closure is based directly on the self-similarity of the local turbulent spectrum. In this way, air entrainment of volcanic plumes can be calculated by 3-D models without the need of any prescribed parameter (Cerminara et al., 2016b). In Fig. 16, we show the turbulent eddies inducing air entrainment tentatively for the 79 CE eruption scenario are shown. Atmospheric stratification, moisture, and wind conditions pose problems regarding boundary conditions, data assimilation (Pardini et al., 2020; Osores et al., 2020), water phase change (Folch et al., 2015), and extremely low pressure and density regions (Costa et al., 2018). Such complexity is reflected by the distribution of the 79 CE pyroclastic fall deposits, as the reconstruction of EU2f points to the southeast, while the one of EU3f to the south (Fig. 5). On the whole, the mimic of the 79 CE volcanic cloud points to the southeast, along the Vesuvius-Crete axis (Fig. 9), indicating some rotation of the dispersal axis as a function of the plume height over time. Volcanic mixtures are multiphase, in which each particle moves with a velocity and temperature different from that of the surrounding gas species. Two-way coupling, i.e. the momentum and energy exchanges between solid particles and gas is of paramount importance when the particle volumetric concentration increases up to around 1%, so it is important in particle settling and sedimentation. Finally, particle-particle interactions (four-way coupling) start to become important when the particle volumetric concentration exceeds 1%, and it is important in hindered settling and deposition. Eulerian multiphase dynamics is computationally extremely expensive because in principle, every grain size classes have a different velocity to be found through a dedicated Navier-Stokes equation. However, for fine to medium ash (pyroclasts finer than 1\u00a0mm) it is the optimal approach, while for coarser ash, lapilli, and bombs a Lagrangian approach is preferable (Balachandar and Eaton, 2010; Valentine et al., 2011). Approximations allows to simplify the problem keeping a good accuracy for ash decoupling, preferential concentration, and settling (Ferry and Balachandar, 2001; Balachandar and Eaton, 2010; Cerminara et al., 2016a). In Fig. 17, we show the difference in the 3-D distribution of 1\u00a0mm ash and 16\u00a0mm lapilli. In Cerminara et al. (2016b), it is shown the effect of spatial resolution, turbulence sub-grid model, and ash decoupling for Plinian and sub-Plinian plume averaged profiles. A key parameter for modelling particle decoupling in dilute systems is the Stokes time, depending on particle size, density and shape, measured in the laboratory through the particle settling velocity (e.g., Bagheri et al., 2015). An additional complication is particles aggregation, changing their size and shape while they are moving in wet atmosphere (Folch et al., 2015; Rossi and Bonadonna, 2021), and particle deceleration through Lagrangian trajectory in denser systems (Doronzo et al., 2012). Plume rise influences the surrounding atmosphere, pushing it away from the plume head, and sucking it from the edges of the plume due to turbulent entrainment. The vertical profiles shown in Fig. 16 are strongly influenced by the air entrainment rate modelled by the 3-D plume simulation. Once the plume reaches its maximum height, its top starts to oscillate creating gravity waves (Suzuki et al., 2016a). Turbulence and conduit exit dynamics create infrasound (Ripepe et al., 2010; Matoza et al., 2019; Cerminara et al., 2016b). In Fig. 16, the infrasonic signal and spectrum that would be measured from a synthetic microphone located in Naples and generated by turbulence is shown. Moving to the bottom of the domain, the multiphase fluid-dynamics of the boundary layer above the topography is important to accurately reproduce pyroclastic current sediment mechanics (Doronzo et al., 2012). In these types of flow, concentration increases due to particle decoupling and a dense layer typically forms below the upper layer that characterizes the transport system (Valentine, 1987; Shimizu et al., 2021). The dense layer may still move also depending on topography (Druitt et al., 2002; Doronzo, 2012). Such interplay between transport and depositional system in pyroclastic currents can be inferred from the deposit characteristics at Cava Pozzelle and Cava di Pollena (see section 4). In topographic lows, the depositional boundary layer first reacts to substrate through a low accumulation rate, then succumbs to forced deposition through a higher accumulation rate (vertical facies variation); a reaction to substrate can also occur on topographic highs (lateral facies variation) (Doronzo et al., 2012). The presented high resolution 3-D numerical simulation of eruption scenarios based on the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius are being simulated with the ASHEE model (Cerminara et al., 2016a, 2016b). Results from a scenario with MER equal to 2\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0108 kg\/s are shown in Figs. 13, 14 and 15\n\n. A smaller scenario is shown in Fig. 16\n (MER = 3\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0107 kg\/s). Interestingly, it is possible to extract from numerical simulations quantities that may be monitored during real volcanic eruptions, such as deposit ground load and grain size distribution (Fig. 17\n), volcanic infrasound (once turbulence is modelled with enough accuracy; Cerminara et al., 2016b) and shocks (related to compressibility effects), infrared emission (Cerminara et al., 2015; Calusi et al., 2020; see Figs. 18\n and 19), and electromagnetic wave backscattering (once optical properties of particles are given; Gouhier and Donnadieu, 2008; Marzano et al., 2020). In Fig. 18, the signal that would be measured by a synthetic radar in Naples is shown. This result was produced by using the information contained in the 3-D simulation, such as the density and velocity fields. In this way, it is possible to evaluate the total backscattering power P\n\ntot\n, the backscattering power of particles moving away from and toward the radar P\n+ and P\n\u2212, the plume reflectivity factor Z, the maximum velocity of particles moving away from the radar V\n\nmax\n, and the particle volumetric concentration C. To better constrain inversion algorithms used to monitor volcanoes, it would be useful to compare these synthetic observations with field data. The decay of the deposit ground load with distance follows the classical deposition from volcanic plumes (cf. Pyle, 1989), which in our case gets to the Sorrento Peninsula and well beyond (Figs. 13 and 14). Curiously, the contemporary eruption of Hunga Tonga occurred in 2022 has shown a number of these phenomena, confirming the reliability of the numerical modelling approach of explosive eruptions.\n\n\n\n11\nSatellite remote sensing\nThe technological advances of satellite remote sensing systems made over the last 20\u00a0years marked a major step forward both in the proximal and distal monitoring of volcanic eruptions in real time. This approach represents a powerful tool able to significantly improve the risk mitigation on local population and air traffic, and to gain insight into processes of volcanic unrest (see for example, Prata and Kerkmann, 2007; Corradini et al., 2018, 2020; Theys et al., 2019). Today, many different instruments, working at different spectral ranges with different spatial\/temporal resolutions and placed in geostationary and polar orbits, offer a unique opportunity to track the whole evolution of the volcanic eruptions, extending the monitoring capabilities both during day and night. Since the beginning of this \u201cnew satellites era\u201d, there (fortunately) were no large-scale eruptions like the 79 CE one of Vesuvius, so no direct measurements of an event of this magnitude are available. An exception (with due proportions) is the Hunga Tonga eruption occurred beginning of 2022. To test the reliability of the algorithms already developed, particularly for the estimation of gases and particles in the volcanic cloud under such extreme conditions, it is therefore necessary to simulate what the satellite would see in those cases. Among the capabilities described in the previous section, numerical modelling can also be used to simulate the upper atmosphere (TOA) radiance, at different wavelengths, as seen by a satellite sensor orbiting the Earth. These TOA radiances depend on surface characteristics (temperature and emissivity), volcanic cloud geometry (altitude and thickness), atmospheric profiles (temperature, pressure and humidity) and ash optical properties (extinction coefficients, single scattering albedos and asymmetry parameters). These latter parameters are those with higher uncertainties leading to higher errors in the retrievals (Prata and Grant, 2001; Corradini et al., 2008). The optical properties can be obtained by knowing the particle refractive index and the size distribution. Generally, if the size distribution can be fixed, the refractive index is unknown and highly variable. Recently, a novel procedure has been introduced for the refractive index computation, based on the percentage of SiO2 present in the ash sample (Prata et al., 2019). The importance of the analysis of samples from the 79 CE eruption deposits is that it allows to estimate the percentage of SiO2 present, then to compute the refractive index of ash particles of the volcanic cloud. These investigations indicate a variation between 54.5 and 57.5% for the white pumices (EU2f), and between 54.0 and 56.5% for the grey pumices (EU3f) (Civetta et al., 1991). Fig. 17 shows the real and imaginary part of the ash refractive index, computed by considering a percentage of SiO2 of 56% in the thermal infrared (TIR) spectral range (6\u201314\u00a0\u03bcm). From the computed refractive index, and considering a defined size distribution, the optical properties can be obtained. Fig. 18 shows the extinction coefficient, single scattering albedo and asymmetry parameter for particles effective radii between 0.5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm (computed considering a log-normal size distribution). By knowing the optical properties, simulations of the TOA radiative effect of ash clouds considering different configurations (i.e., different volcanic cloud altitudes, ash mass etc.\u2026) can be realized. This will help us to understand the validity limits of the retrieval procedures in case of Plinian eruptions, and to understand how to improve and make them even more effective. Such knowledge strengthens our preparedness, and then increases effectiveness and responsiveness of our actions in case of similar events. Another type of sensors onboard of remote sensing aircrafts is the radar. Today, a huge number of observations based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are available, and the InSAR (Interferometric SAR) technique is able to process such data and constrain ground deformations with spatial resolution of few meters and sub-millimeter accuracy. Also, missions such as Sentinel-1 from the European Space Agency (ESA) provide SAR data with revisit time of 6\u00a0days, allowing for a dense temporal sampling of the surface deformations. The satellite constellations launched by global space agencies have different capabilities to capture large or small deformations, and are affected by coherence issues in different ways. As an example, X-band SAR sensors (3.1\u00a0cm wavelength, e.g., COSMO-Skymed from the Italian Space Agency ASI) have very high spatial resolution, but can decorrelate easily for intense deformations or in vegetated areas. On the other hand, L-band (24\u00a0cm wavelenght, e.g., ALOS-2 from the Japanese Space Agency JAXA) are capable of high coherence in case of large displacements and presence of vegetation, but cannot map small displacements. In between, there are the C-band SAR sensors (5.4 wavelength, e.g., Sentinel-1). With reference to the 79 CE eruption, pre-eruptive surface displacements are expected to have taken place (Biggs et al., 2014), that might have been detected by InSAR data in X- and C- bands. Modelling of such deformations would give insights on the position, depth and volume variation of the magmatic source or feeding dyke in case of a similar eruption in the future. Very short-time pre-eruptive and syn-eruptive deformations are expected to be intense due to magma ascent toward the surface, and InSAR processing might present decorrelation issues, so C- and L- bands are more suitable. Patterns of lava and pyroclastic currents results to be incoherent with standard InSAR processing, but innovative techniques such as automatic change detection can estimate the lava field and its temporal evolution, combining the InSAR coherence and the InSAR intensity during an eventual emergency phase (e.g., Bignami et al., 2020).\n\n\n12\nConclusions and future perspectives\nThe present work on the 79 CE Plinian eruption of Vesuvius reviewed all available information (both from the literature and original) from a multidisciplinary perspective, by discussing the eruption sequence not only with different investigation approaches, but also following ideally the eruption from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. The work has revised the historical, stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrological, geophysical, paleoclimatic, and modelling aspects of the eruption, which for the first time are combined all together to give a full picture of the 79 CE eruption. With reference to the eruption deposits, a total of 346 stratigraphic sections have been reviewed not only in the Campanian Plain but also farther, both from the literature and as original data. For Pompeii, 39 stratigraphic sections have been reviewed with a focus on the eruption effects in the urban area, plus some other scattered sections. In particular, the database of Gurioli et al. (2010) has been integrated with new medial-to-ultradistal observational points in which the 79 CE pyroclastic deposits have been found (City of Naples, Pollino, Calabria, Sicily, offshore data), in order to show the global environmental impact of the eruption. A large database and a detailed stratigraphy are fundamental not only for the reconstruction of past explosive eruptions, but also for the set up, along with surveillance, of statistical models for probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment, particularly at monitoring volcanoes. With reference to the petrology and modelling, the information from the literature has provided a general but complete picture of the eruption sequence, which reflected a compositional zonation into the magma chamber. Such zonation is something that has also been detected at other explosive volcanic areas worldwide that gave variably large volume eruptions, such as for example Tenerife (Bryan et al., 2000; Mart\u00ed et al., 2020) and Novarupta (Hildreth and Fierstein, 2012), among others.\nOn the other hand, some open issues have arisen from the project, each one emerged from the various approaches, and will be addressed in the future in the more general framework of Plinian eruptions. One thing will be to constrain the timing and various phases of the eruption, including the description of ongoing phenomena (e.g., fine ash dispersal into the atmosphere and environmental impact) that might occur during Plinian events similar to the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius. This can have important implications both on direct and indirect effects of atmospheric ash dispersal in the environment at various scales. As it occurred for other similar large explosive eruptions, such as for example at Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and Popocat\u00e9petl in Prehispanic time, the ash dispersal and gas emission can impact directly the climate then (in)directly the agriculture, by modifying the atmospheric temperature and precipitation of acid rains due to significant fine ash and volcanic gas emissions, and the soil fertility and water availability (Siebe et al., 1996; Dartevelle et al., 2002; Costa et al., 2018; Aubry et al., 2021), as well as can impact civil aviation (Sulpizio et al., 2012; Gouhier et al., 2019). Compared with other Plinian eruptions of Vesuvius, such as the \u201cAvellino\u201d one, the total duration of the eruption (both fall and pyroclastic current phases) could be better constrained, because different pulses feeding the pyroclastic currents may be separated by variably-short quiescence states (Di Vito et al., 2009). Such instants could occur at fragmentation scale by discrete explosive events, particularly during phreatomagmatic phases, as well as at deposition scale (Vazquez and Ort, 2006; N\u00e9meth and Cronin, 2009; Sohn et al., 2011; Agustin-Flores et al., 2014), and this may not be so evident in proximal areas due to concomitant fall and pyroclastic current processes. As a general case, in a specific site a pyroclastic current can emplace a deposit while the eruption has already ceased at the vent, or vice versa the current does not emplace a deposit (for topographic reason and\/or deposition timing) but the eruption is still ongoing, which is something that could be addressed from the deposits in distal areas (Sorrento Peninsula or new sites for future investigations). Also, refined interpretations of the distal and ultradistal tephras will help further constraining the modelling of volcanic column in explosive eruptions. Distal and ultradistal deposits can give insights about the concentration of fine ash present in the umbrella cloud at the time of eruption. As an example, assuming a threshold of ash concentration of 2\u00a0mg\/m3 for aircraft's turbines damaging and an umbrella cloud 1\u00a0km thick, we get a corresponding threshold of 2\u00a0mm the deposit of fine ash (Gouhier et al., 2019), vice versa the 2\u00a0mm thick area would imply a volcanic hazard for civil aviation. Following comparison, ashes of the \u201cAvellino\u201d eruption have been found up to Tuscany Region and Adriatic Sea (Sulpizio et al., 2008), and the ones of the sub-Plinian 472 \u201cPollena\u201d eruption have been found up to Constantinople (Marcellino Comite\u2019 Chronicon in Ricciardi, 2009), testifying the regional impact that large eruptions of Vesuvius can have.\nAnother thing will be constraining the definition of the evolutionary mechanisms (physical, geochemical and petrological) that determined the passage from one phase of the eruption to the next. This has implications on new geochemical and tephrostratigraphic constraints in distal and ultradistal areas to further refine the calculation of the 79 CE erupted magma, and in more proximal areas (e.g., Cava Pozzelle, Terzigno) for fine geochemical analyses over the entire stratigraphic sequence. Another issue will be constraining the definition of the eruption source parameters for Plinian eruptions, by increasing the number and type of simulated observables (e.g., satellite data), and using the simulated satellite data to assess the uncertainties and improve the retrieval algorithms for the volcanic ash cloud. On this side, remote sensing real-time data can help volcanic hazard assessment and risk procedures. Comparison with synthetic data from numerical simulations can refine and better constrain such kind of data. A need of the future community of scientists tasked with monitoring active volcanoes \u2013 in light of the present comprehensive work on the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius \u2013 will be to detect the mass eruption rate in quasi real-time for plume dynamics (D\u00fcrig et al., 2015), then assess the local impact for pyroclastic current dynamics (Esposti Ongaro et al., 2008) such as for example from Cava di Pollena. This can have implications on the forecasting of ash dispersion into the atmosphere in terms of environmental, aviation, agricultural, and hydric impacts, and of ash distribution and accumulation on landscape.\nFurther issues will be integrating earth and satellite instruments with the use of different wavelengths (from VIS to MW), and forecasting the impact of similar Plinian eruptions in the future, including precursory to sin-eruptive (e.g., ground deformation via FEM models, seismicity, sin-eruptive debris flows) and post-eruptive (e.g., post-eruptive debris flows via reverse engineering) phenomena. In particular, secondary phenomena, such as debris flows generated by the remobilization of ash and fine lapilli deposits, can significantly impact the local landscape over long periods of time. This is because a thicker, but local, debris flow deposit can form after variably-fast remobilization of a thinner primary pyroclastic deposit, particularly along ravines and inside valleys. Such a phenomenon can occur multiple times, also depending on seasonal local weather, and this has a heavy impact on landscape, hence on local human activities, as it has occurred in the Sorrento Peninsula after the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius.\nLastly, other issues will be reconstructing and synchronizing the climatic phases (through archives) at the time of the 79 CE eruption, in order to generally assess the environmental impact of Plinian eruptions at regional scale, and studying and measuring systematically the outsized clasts (ballistics, boulders, charred trunks, walls) found both in the fall and pyroclastic current deposits of the 79 CE eruption of Vesuvius, in order to assess the ballistic impacts and flow dynamic pressures on landscape and urban areas. Systematic studies and mapping of spatial distribution of fall and pyroclastic current impact parameters are lacking for this eruption, and they will be done to further improve the knowledge of products vs. processes related to Plinian eruptions. Such need is indeed related to the lesson learned from the 79 CE eruption, and its impacting feature on landscape. By imagining to zoom in the eruption at the scale, for example, of Roman towns, we find general aspects that can be applied to many explosive volcanoes worldwide, particularly when inhabited areas are directly exposed to eruption impact (e.g., at Merapi; see Jenkins et al., 2013). By also keeping in mind the principles of thermodynamics, and the governing equations that model volcanic processes, we find at Vesuvius that locally-enhanced flow dynamic pressures and velocities, forced deposition against obstacles vs. shadow zones with no deposition, and thermal effects can be extremely important during pyroclastic current-building interaction, not only in proximal reaches (Luongo et al., 2003a; Zuccaro and Ianniello, 2004; Gurioli et al., 2005a; Di Vito et al., 2009; Doronzo and Dellino, 2011; Scandone et al., 2019). The archaeological excavations that have been made over the years in the Roman towns around Vesuvius, and very likely the ones that will be made in the future, shed an alarm in volcanic hazard assessment at the scale of city, as modern architecture could take advantage from what happened in 79 CE. On the other hand, a multiphase fluid dynamic approach is necessary for constraining the interaction between pyroclastic currents and local topographies\/urban structures.\nAll these points could contribute to address quantitatively each of the different but contiguous phenomena occurring in Plinian eruptions, without neglecting the ensemble view of the explosive event from the magma chamber to the most distal tephras. A complete knowledge of these eruptions, of the factors governing their dynamics and phases, and of all source and impact parameters is of paramount importance also in risk evaluation and mitigation, especially in densely inhabited and urbanized areas, but also in distal and ultradistal ones, in consideration of the vulnerability of our structures and infrastructures. This is a further lesson also for the next-generation models of explosive eruptions, which will take advantage from a more precise timing of the different eruptive phases, from a global evolution of the volcanic cloud at regional scale, and from a local impact of the pyroclastic currents at municipal scale. We would like to conclude with the Ascanio Filomarino's words about the importance of systematically collecting data before, during, and after an eruption. When he was describing his pioneeristic seismograph, now in exhibition at the Museum of Osservatorio Vesuviano - INGV, he concluded that \u201c\u2026By observing these together with the external signs of the volcano, it may sometimes be possible, if not to clearly foresee a new eruption, at least to conjecture it\u201d (Filomarino, 1797).\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDomenico M.

(1983) and Dahlen et al. (1984)). While there is general agreement about the regional scale geology of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt there are, nevertheless, considerable differences in the structural interpretations about the location of the basal thrust, whether there is crystalline basement involved in the thrusting, if there is triangle zone, or duplex (including antiformal stack) development at the front, the existence, location and orientation of transfer zones, and the amount of shortening that is being accomodated. Because the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt is currently active, having a structural model for it that has along-strike consistency across an array of data types is of considerable social importance since it has a significant impact on how geological hazards and risks are viewed and modelled (e.g., Loh et al., 1991; Campbell et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 2007; Camanni et al., 2014a; Wu et al., 2017).\nSince 2006, our research group has carried out extensive new field mapping in south-central Taiwan (Fig. 1\n). The aim has been to investigate the structure of the fold-and-thrust belt and the influence of inherited structures that were located on the continental margin that is entering into the deformation (e.g., Brown et al., 2012, 2017; Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2016; Biete et al., 2018, 2019). In this paper we bring together these studies, first presenting a proxy for the crystalline basement-to-cover interface derived from a P-wave tomographic model (Kuo-Chen et al., 2012) that we then integrate with our field mapping to construct a structural model that has 3D consistency. As a proof of concept, we then test whether or not this model can explain aspects of the seismicity, GPS, and topography data from the south-central part of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\n\n2.1\nThe southeast margin of the Eurasian plate\nTaiwan (Fig. 1A) is an active mountain belt that has been forming since the Late Miocene as the result of the collision of the Luzon arc with the deeply subducting Eurasian margin (e.g., Teng, 1990; Sibuet and Hsu, 1997; Sibuet and Hsu, 2004, Huang et al., 2014a). To better understand the structure of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt it is important to have a first-order understanding of the morphology, geology, structure, and Mesozoic through Holocene evolution of the part of the Eurasian margin that is now entering into the deformation taking place in western Taiwan (e.g., Camanni and Ye, 2022). The morphology of the margin to the west of Taiwan consists of a broad proximal zone, a roughly northeast-striking slope break (roughly the 200-m bathymetry contour), a slope, and a broad distal zone (Fig. 1). The structure of the margin is comprised of a shelf area with fault-bound, Eocene-age basins, a necking zone where the basement thins from the shelf to the distal margin (e.g., Mohn et al., 2012), and a c. 300\u00a0km wide hyper-extended margin (Fig. 1). The crustal thickness of the shelf is 30 +\/\u2212 5\u00a0km (Yeh et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2005; Kuo-Chen et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014a, 2014b; Wu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016), thinning to approximately 18\u00a0km along the hyper-extended part of the margin (Fig. 1B) (Chen and Yang, 1996; Li et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2012; McIntosh et al., 2013, 2014). The transition from the margin's continental crust to the oceanic crust of the South China Sea occurs to the south of the area shown in Fig. 1 (e.g., Nissen et al., 1995; Zhao et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2004: Deng et al., 2012; Yeh et al., 2012; McIntosh et al., 2013; Lester et al., 2014). Importantly for this paper, the structural and geomorphological grain of the margin that is entering into the deformation is roughly ENE-WSW, which is at a high angle to the approximately N-S structural grain of the fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 1).\nThe Mesozoic pre-rift geology and lithostratigraphy of the shelf area that is entering into the Taiwan mountain belt is not well known, although the depth to the top of the Mesozoic has been mapped in some detail (Fig. 1) (Lin et al., 2003). Eocene-age synrift basins are oriented roughly northeast-southwest (Hsu, 2001; Lin and Watts, 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Teng and Lin, 2004; Lin et al., 2005; Cukur et al., 2011), and they locally accumulated up to c. 5\u00a0km of sediments (e.g., Lin et al., 2003). The Taihsi Basin, and in particular its eastern flank, the Hsuehshan Trough (Range in Fig. 1A) (Teng et al., 1991; Teng and Lin, 2004), is being deformed in central and northwestern Taiwan (Fig. 1a). The late Miocene extensional basins on the outer shelf and necking zone of the margin (of interest to this paper is the Tainan Basin) have roughly east-northeast striking bounding faults (Yang et al., 1991, 2016; Lee et al., 1993; Lin et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2008; Tang and Zheng, 2010).\n\n\n2.2\nGeological provinces of the Taiwan Orogen\nThe Taiwan orogen is divided into five roughly N-S oriented geological provinces that are separated by major faults (Fig. 1A). From west to east these zones are: the Coastal Plain, the Western Foothills, the Hsuehshan Range, the Central Range, and the Coastal Range. In much of south-central Taiwan, the boundary between the Coastal Plain and the Western Foothills is interpreted to coincide with the mostly buried tip line of the Changhua thrust (ChT in Fig. 1A). In the north of the study area, the Western Foothills is juxtaposed against the Hsuehshan Range across the Shuilikeng Fault (SkF). In the east, the Hsuehshan Range is juxtaposed against the Central Range across the Lishan Fault (LF). Southward, the Shuilikeng and Lishan faults link up with one another and the Central Range is juxtaposed against the Western Foothills along the Chaochou Fault (ChF). In what follows, we interpret the Coastal Plain, the Western Foothills, and the Hsuehshan Range to make up the fold-and-thrust belt in south-central Taiwan. The Central Range makes up the internal part of the orogeny as it is comprised of weakly metamorphosed Cenozoic clastic sediments with Mesozoic crystalline rocks forming the basement on which they were deposited.\n\n\n2.3\nStratigraphy of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt\nThe Mesozoic basement rocks do not crop out in the fold-and-thrust belt. However, in the Central Range where they do crop out they are comprised predominantly of marble and schist (Stanley et al., 1981; Ernst, 1983; Ho, 1988; Lan et al., 2008). The absolute ages of these rocks are not well constrained, although a number of Permian to Cretaceous isotopic ages have been determined (Jahn et al., 1986; Lo and Onstott, 1995; Lan et al., 2008; Yui et al., 2009, 2012; Wintsch et al., 2011). In western Taiwan and its offshore, several boreholes have intersected weakly metamorphosed siliciclastic and carbonate rocks that have been interpreted to range in age from Late Permian to Cretaceous (e.g., Jahn et al., 1992; Chiu, 1975; Ho, 1988; Shaw, 1996), although there is disagreement about the interpretations of the age of these rocks (e.g., Chiu, 1975; Ho, 1988; Shaw, 1996).\nWhile the rocks of the Hsuehshan Range are accepted to be Eocene and Oligocene in age (e.g., Ho, 1988; Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012, 2013) (Fig. 1A), in the study area the paucity of age-determinant fossils complicates the understanding of the Eocene-aged stratigraphy. Furthermore, the rocks of the Hsuehshan Range are faulted and folded and, along its eastern and southern flank, a penetrative slaty cleavage is ubiquitous in the fine-grained units (e.g., Brown et al., 2012), making any estimate of thickness approximate. The lowest Eocene stratigraphic unit that crops out is the Chiayang Fm, which is comprised of up to 2000\u00a0m of thick-bedded sandstone and shale. The Chiayang Fm is overlain by the Shipachungshi Fm, an up to 1000-m-thick unit of thin-bedded sandstone and mudstone. The Shipachungschi Fm is conformably overlain by the Paileng Fm. The Paileng Fm consists of 4000 to 5000\u00a0m of thick-bedded, coarse-grained sandstone with quartz-pebble conglomerate and argillite at its base (the Tachien member), overlain by interbedded sandstone and bioturbated argillite and, at the top, coarse-grained to quartz-pebble conglomerate with minor amounts of lithofragments and feldspar. The Tachien member has been dated by large foraminifera to be late early to middle Eocene in age (Chen et al., 2009). Locally, in the northern part of the study area, middle to late Eocene-age (Huang et al., 2013) volcanic rocks of the Tsukeng Fm overlie the Paileng Fm (Chiu, 1975). Regionally, the Paileng Fm is unconformably overlain by several hundred meters of early Oligocene sandstone and shale of the Shuichangliu Fm (Fig. 2\n). This unconformity is interpreted to be the break-up unconformity that preceded the opening of the South China Sea (e.g., Teng, 1992; Lin et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2017).\nIn this paper, the chronostratigraphic nomenclature scheme of Alvarez-Marron et al. (2014) and Brown et al. (2017) is used for the Miocene and younger rocks (Fig. 2). This scheme follows the north to south stratigraphic correlation of Shea et al. (2003). In south-central Taiwan, the outcropping Miocene rocks can be broadly divided into four formations. The early Miocene Takeng Fm is comprised of approximately 800 to 1000\u00a0m of thick-bedded sandstone at the base, overlain by thin-bedded sandstone and shale near the top. The Takeng Fm is overlain by up to 500\u00a0m of shale (Shihti shale at the base) and thick-bedded sandstone of the Nankang Fm. The Nankang Fm is in turn overlain by the Nanchuang Fm. Although, locally, in the northernmost part of the study area, the Nankang Fm is unconformably overlain by the Kueichulin Fm. The Nanchuang Fm is made up of thin- to thick-bedded sandstone intercalated with shale. Its thickness varies widely across the study area, ranging from several hundred meters in the north to >2000\u00a0m in the south. It is unconformably overlain by the latest Miocene to early Pliocene Kueichulin Fm, which is comprised of 150\u00a0m to >3000\u00a0m of thin- to very thick-bedded muddy sandstone and sandy mudstone. The Kueichulin Fm is conformably overlain by the Pliocene- to Pleistocene-aged Cholan Fm. The base of the Cholan Fm is comprised of the several hundred-meter-thick Chinshui shale unit, followed upward by up to 3000\u00a0m of interbedded mudstone, shale, and sandstone. The Cholan Fm is conformably overlain by the Pleistocene Toukoshan Fm, a coarsening upward sequence made up of thick-bedded sandstone with shale interbeds that, upward, becomes interfingered with, and eventually completely replaced by conglomerate. In parts of the map area, the Toukoshan Fm may reach a thickness of up to 5000\u00a0m and, in the south, it has a number of unconformities. It is overlain by Holocene-age gravels that, in places, are several hundred meters thick.\nIn tectonostratigraphic terms for the Taiwan orogen, the Mesozoic rocks form the pre-rift, the Eocene the syn-rift, the Oligocene to late Miocene the post-rift, and the late Miocene through Holocene is the syn-orogenic (Fig. 2A). In this paper, we define the pre-rift Mesozoic rocks as the crystalline basement and assume that it is comprised of similar lithologies as the Mesozoic rocks found in the Central Range. Because of its regionally developed unconformity (Lin and Watts, 2002; Tensi et al., 2006), the base of the late Miocene-age Kueichulin Fm is taken to mark the onset of sedimentation in the foreland basin. This is in contrast to Teng (1987), Covey (1986), and Hong (1997), who suggest that the onset of foreland basin sedimentation occurred during the early Pliocene, and is recorded by the first appearance of slate clasts in the Chinshui shale at the base of the Cholan Fm.\n\n\n\n3\nData description and methodologies\n\n3.1\nP-wave velocity and a proxy for the basement-cover interface\nThe involvement of crystalline basement in the deformation in a fold-and-thrust belt has implications for the geometric construction of cross sections, for the amount of shortening, the location of the basal thrust, or the transition into the metamorphic internal part of the mountain belt, among other things (e.g., Hatcher and Williams, 1986; Pfiffner, 2017; Poblet and Lisle, 2011; Lacombe and Bellahsen, 2016; Tavani et al., 2021). Therefore, in the interpretation of the structure that follows, it is important to have an estimate of the depth to the basement-cover interface. Since crystalline basement does not crop out in the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt, we use a petrophysical approach to define a proxy for the basement-cover interface that we can then use to interpret where (and if) basement is involved in the thrusting. We choose a P-wave velocity (Vp) of 5.2\u00a0km\/s as a proxy for the basement-cover interface for the following reasons; 1) it is in keeping with the upper range of Vp determined from laboratory measurements carried out on clastic rocks and at the lower range of common crustal crystalline rocks (Fig. 3\n) (Christensen, 1989; Johnston and Christensen, 1992, 1993; Mavko et al., 2009; Christensen and Stanley, 2003; Brocher, 2005) and, 2) it is in keeping with the measured Vp (<5\u00a0km\/s) of the late Miocene and younger sediments intersected by the Taiwan Chelungpu Fault Drilling Project borehole A (Wang et al., 2009).\n\n3.1.1\nVp data, methodology and uncertainties\nThe depth and geometry of the Vp 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface is derived from the TAIGER local Vp model of Kuo-Chen et al. (2012). In this velocity model, the upper 24\u00a0km of the crust, which is the part of interest here, the discretization of the 3D velocity grid is 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km horizontally and 2\u00a0km vertically, and at these depths we can expect a resolution of at least 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0km in the horizontal and 10\u00a0km vertical. We refer the reader to Kuo-Chen et al. (2012) for a detailed description of the acquisition and processing parameters, as well as the resolution testing, of the TAIGER data set.\nThe 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface is, however, a proxy and is meant to help with the interpretation of the approximate location and shape of basement-cover interface. A key uncertainty in the use of the 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface as a proxy for the basement-cover interface is that the lithology of the basement rocks in south-central Taiwan is not well known. A further uncertainty, especially in the depth and shape, is the resolution of the velocity model. These uncertainties mean that the 5.2\u00a0km\/s proxy for the basement-cover interface may not be valid in detail everywhere. Nevertheless, the major features described below are also found in the Vp tomography models of Kim et al. (2005), Wu et al. (2007), and Huang et al. (2014b), so we think they are robust features that can be reliably interpreted.\n\n\n3.1.2\nVp and a proxy for the basement-cover interface\nThroughout the study area, at 4\u00a0km depth Vp is everywhere <5.2\u00a0km\/s except along the central, eastern part of the Western Foothills (WF) and in the Hsuehshan Range (HR) (Fig. 4A). To the north of c. 24\u00b0, the Coastal Plain (CP) and Western Foothills (WF) areas are characterized by Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s at 6\u00a0km depth (with two small areas of lower Vp) and, at 8\u00a0km depth, Vp is almost everywhere >5.4\u00a0km\/s (Fig. 4B and C). The Hsuehshan Range (HR) is almost everywhere characterized by Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s with, locally, Vp >5.8\u00a0km\/s along the Lishan fault (LF). To the south of c. 24\u00b0, the Coastal Plain and the Western Foothills is characterized by Vp <5\u00a0km\/s at 4\u00a0km depth, with the exception of an area of Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s to the west of the southern part of the Shuilikeng fault (SkF). At 6\u00a0km depth, much of the area to the south of 24\u00b0 has Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s and, at 8\u00a0km depth, Vp is almost everywhere >5.4\u00a0km\/s.\nOn the basis of our proposal that the 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface be used as a proxy for the basement-cover interface, a number of basement highs and lows can be interpreted beneath the Coastal Plain and the Western Foothills. Among these, the Tainan (TBH), Peikang (PBH), Alishan (ABH), and Northern (NBH) highs reach <5\u00a0km below sea level (Fig. 4D). The nearly continuous Hsuehshan basement high (HBH) reaches as shallow as 0\u00a0km below sea level, locally. Both the Central (CBL) and the Pingtung (PBL) basement lows reach >8\u00a0km depth.\n\n\n\n3.2\nStructure of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt\n\n3.2.1\nData, methodology and uncertainties\nThe structural analyses and interpretations that follow are based on new geological mapping (Fig. 5\n) carried out over 11 field campaigns during which >6000 structural and lithological observations were made at around 3000 data points over an area of approximately 13,000\u00a0km2. The mapping was carried out at 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scales using the geological maps of the Central Geological Survey of Taiwan as a base. The final map was drawn at 1:100,000 scale (Supplementary data set 1) using the chronostratigraphic scheme presented in Fig. 2. For reasons of clarity, in Fig. 5 only representative structural data are shown. In the map, the major thrusts and their names have been correlated from north to south (see Ho (1988) for a similar correlation).\nThirteen cross sections (Fig. 6\n) were constructed using the geological map, field structural data, published borehole information, and standard section construction techniques (Dahlstrom, 1969; Hossack, 1979; De Paor, 1988). All cross sections are oriented perpendicular to the regional strike of structures (bedding, thrusts, and major fold axial traces). Borehole lithological information was projected along the bedding strike onto the plane of the section. Where possible, the cross sections were restored by conserving bed-length (while conserving area) until they were deemed to be viable (Supplementary data 2). These sections can, therefore, be considered as balanced. Because of the absence of stratigraphic cutoffs, out-of-sequence thrusting, and a penetrative cleavage in the Hsuehshan Range, sections 1, 2 and 3 could not be restored. For balancing the cross sections, the western pin line was placed in the undeformed rocks to the west of the tip line of the frontal thrust and the sections were restored to a horizontal top of the Kueichulin Fm, a regional-scale marker that can be mapped throughout much of the study area. For restoration, a forward propagation (piggy-back) sequence of thrusting was assumed. Minimum shortening (length difference between the deformed and undeformed section) and fault displacement (distance a cut-off moved along a fault surface) estimates were made for the restored sections (Table 1\n). In an iterative process, together with the construction of cross sections, four roughly north-south, strike-parallel sections were also constructed (Fig. 7\n), as was a map of the basal thrust (Fig. 8\n). Below, in subsection 3.2.2, we present a detailed description of our structural interpretations and explain the reasoning behind choices that were made in making them.\nThere are a number of uncertainties involved in the data set used to build the structural model presented below. The primary data set for the interpretation of the structure is the geological map. During the mapping a number of assumptions were made that could have led to errors in the final map. Of these, the two most important are, 1) the assumption of a chronostratigraphic correlation that links different rock units together on the basis of age and, 2) the assumptions made for correlating thrusts and stratigraphic contacts along strike through steep, heavily forested terrain with sparse outcrop. Over most of the map area, we estimate that the location of stratigraphic contacts and faults are accurate to with 1\u00a0km. Any errors generated during the mapping were then introduced into the cross sections and these, together with the general assumptions involved in the cross section construction (plane strain, no layer parallel slip, fold mechanism, horizontal top for the Kueichulin Fm, the depth to the basal thrust calculations) may also lead to errors in the cross sections. A weakly constrained stratigraphic thickness template precluded doing rigorous area balancing. Also, the borehole information was taken from various publications and it may, therefore, contain significant errors that we are unaware of. While we have taken care to keep all of these uncertainties to a minimum, we nevertheless present both the map and the cross sections as interpretations, the restorations as approximations, and the displacement and shortening calculations as minimums.\n\n\n3.2.2\nSurface geology, cross sections, basal thrust, and shortening\nThe surface geology of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt is comprised of Eocene through Pleistocene clastic rocks and Holocene sediments (Fig. 5A). On the shelf area of the margin (north of the thick, gray, dashed line in Fig. 5A), thrusts and fold axial traces in the Coastal Plain and the Western Foothills strike approximately N-S, and both major and minor folds plunge (overall) gently (<20\u00b0) to moderately (20\u00b0 to 40\u00b0) southward (Fig. 5B and C). Eastward, in the Hsuehshan Range, thrusts and fold axes strike roughly NNE, oblique to the Shuilikeng fault. Folds plunge predominantly to the SSW, except in the southernmost part where they often have a moderate NNE plunge (Fig. 5B and C). A penetrative, ESE-dipping pressure solution cleavage is developed in the hanging wall of the Tili thrust (Fig. 5A). Southward, the Tili thrust is cut by the Shuilikeng fault. The Hsuehshan Range is bound to the east by the Lishan fault, a ductile shear zone with an indeterminate sense of shear. South of c. 23.5\u00b0 N, at the transition into the necking zone of the margin (Figs. 1 and 5), there is a marked increase in the map distribution and thickness of the Miocene rocks. Thrusts pass through a pronounced NE-striking, en-echelon bend before taking on a NNE strike farther south, and folds plunge overall toward the NE to SW (Fig. 5). The ENE-striking, dextral Meishan fault offsets the frontal thrust and minor dextral strike-slip faults are found along its strike, in the Hsuehshan Range. The map trace of the Meishan fault marks the surface rupture of the 1906 Meishan earthquake (e.g., Bonilla, 1975). The Alishan ranges (Fig. 5) are comprised of Miocene and Pliocene-aged rocks that are open to tightly folded into NNE to SSW-plunging anticlines and synclines. The southern flank of the Alishan ranges is cut by the Yichu fault, a roughly ENE-striking brittle fault zone with a dextral sense of displacement. Immediately south of the Yichu fault, thrusts have a right-stepping, en-echelon change in strike with, locally, short hanging wall splays. The structure is dominated by thrust-bound, moderately SSW-plunging synclines (Fig. 5) that are cored by syn-orogenic Pliocene and Pleistocene-aged rocks and have middle Miocene Nanchuang Fm rocks along their western limbs, in the hanging wall of thrusts. To the east, the Neiyingshan anticline (NeA) plunges moderately NNE and SSW, changing along strike into the upright Kuanglin syncline (KS). At c. 23\u00b0 N, the ENE-striking, dextral Hsinhua fault can be traced from its 1946 surface rupture (e.g., Bonilla, 1975) on the Coastal Plain eastward into the thrust belt where it is associated with en-echelon bends in thrusts and ENE-striking minor faults. To the south of c. 23\u00b0 N, the outcropping geology is comprised of piggyback basins carrying Holocene sediments and the Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks of the SSW-plunging Xuxian antiform (XA) (Fig. 5). In the south, the fold-and-thrust belt is bound to the east by the Chaochou fault, a brittle fault with a variable, oblique, top-to-the-northwest sense of displacement (see also Wiltschko et al., 2010).\nIn cross section, we interpret the structure of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt to be a west-verging, imbricate thrust system in which listric thrusts are linked to a single basal thrust (Fig. 6). In cross sections 1, 2, and 3, on the basis of bedding dips and the thickness of the Pliocene and younger rocks in the hanging wall, we interpret the basal thrust to dip about 6\u00b0 to the ENE at a depth of c. 6 to 8\u00a0km. The interpretation and location of a hanging wall flat geometry in the Changhua (ChT) and Chelungpu (CT) thrust sheets is based on published seismic reflection profiles (Wang et al., 2002), bedding dips, and the continuous outcrop of lower Pliocene rocks along the hanging wall of the Chelungpu thrust in this area (Fig. 5A). The Shuangtung thrust (ST) places folded lower and middle Miocene rocks on top of Pliocene and Pleistocene rocks and this, together with the hanging wall ramp structure, indicates that the basal thrust cuts down through the stratigraphy. The Shuangtung thrust sheet is bound to the east by the Shuilikeng fault (SkF). Kinematic indicators observed along the Shuilikeng fault suggest that it has a varied slip history that, when combined with earthquake focal mechanisms, indicate that it is an oblique thrust (Camanni et al., 2014b). On the basis of the obliquity of the hanging wall stratigraphic contacts and fold axial traces with the map trace of the Shuilikeng fault and the truncation of the Tili thrust, we interpret it to be out-of-sequence and to cut the Shuangtung thrust at depth (see sections 2 and 3). The outcropping Eocene and Oligocene rocks in the Hsuehshan Range indicates that the basal thrust has ramped down stratigraphic section, and the presence of rocks with a Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s in the shallow subsurface suggests that it involves crystalline basement (Figs. 4, 5 and 6). The regional-scale structure of the Hsuehshan Range is that of a northwest-verging, SSW-plunging, basement-cored anticlinorium. The combined fault displacement in sections 1 through 3 is >21\u00a0km but, because there are no stratigraphic cut-offs to the west of the Shuangtung thrust, it is not possible to calculate displacement or shortening exactly (Table 1).\nBetween sections 3 and 4, there is a roughly 2\u00a0km southward decrease in the thickness of the Pliocene and younger rocks, and a\u00a0>\u00a03\u00a0km increase in the thickness of Miocene rocks (Figs. 6 and 7). There is a significant north to south change in the elevation of the contact between the Kueichulin and Cholan Fms, suggesting that it is uplifted by up to 7\u00a0km (e.g., Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014). The basal thrust undergoes a pronounced change in strike, and a southward decrease in depth while ramping down stratigraphic section (Figs. 6 and 7). All of these changes between sections 3 and 4, together with the change in strike of thrusts, in the regional strike and dip of bedding, and in the plunge direction of folds, are associated with a roughly NNW-facing lateral culmination wall that we interpret to be forming due to the dextral strike-slip reactivation of an ENE-striking basement fault (Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014) (Fig. 7). We call this the Choshui lateral structure. Southward, in cross sections 4 through 7, the basal thrust has a ramp-flat geometry as it cuts down stratigraphic section from the near surface to about 4\u00a0km depth, from where it is interpreted to dip into the basement rocks (Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s) (Fig. 6). Through the Alishan ranges, the Changhua and Chelungpu (CT) thrust sheets form east-dipping monoclines with the Chelungpu thrust sheet now carrying roughly 5\u00a0km of Miocene rocks. The hanging wall of the Shuangtung thrust is comprised of several anticlines and synclines that together make up the regional-scale, west-verging, basement-cored Alishan anticlinorium. In the strike-parallel sections (Fig. 7), the Changhua and Chelungpu thrusts ramp gently up through the stratigraphic section through the Alishan ranges, with the overall geometry of hanging wall flats above footwall flats. Total fault displacement in sections 4 through 7 is between 9 and 12\u00a0km, with shortening about 15\u00a0km (Table 1). Between sections 7 and 8, across the Yichu fault, the Alishan anticlinorium changes abruptly southward to three thrust-bound synforms (Figs. 5 and 6). The Yichu fault is interpreted to breach the basal thrust (Fig. 7). In sections 8 through 13, the basal thrust has a ramp-flat geometry and dips overall about 6\u00b0 toward the SE before involving basement along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 6). Continuously outcropping Nanchuang Fm along the hanging walls of the Chelungpu, Chutochi (CuT), and Pingshi (PT) thrusts, together with a similar level of erosion in the cores of the synclines (Fig. 5A), indicates that the basal thrust beneath these thrust sheets forms a flat within the middle Miocene rocks (Fig. 6). In sections 12 and 13, the Xuxian antiform (XA) forms a ramp anticline whose hinge and back limb areas are imbricated along the Lungchan (LT), Pingshi, and Chishan thrusts. In the strike-parallel sections (Fig. 7), the basal thrust deepens toward the south and is interpreted to be cut by Hsinhua fault. Total fault displacement in sections 8 through 13 is between 16 and 25\u00a0km, with shortening of between 15 and 25\u00a0km (Table 1).\nIn map view, the basal thrust has an overall c. 55\u00b0 change in dip direction from north to south, and three significant changes in dip amount and dip direction that we interpret to be associated with lateral and oblique ramps (Fig. 8A). These lateral and oblique ramps are interpreted to be forming as a result of reactivation of ENE-striking faults in the basement (Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017; Biete et al., 2018) that can be traced from the offshore through the Coastal Plain (Lin et al., 2003) and into the fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 1A). Where basement is involved in the thrusting, the basal thrust has a steep ESE dip. Changes in the strike of the contours of the basal thrust across the Choushui lateral structure and the Yichu and Hsinhua oblique ramps, as well as the ramp into the basement beneath the Hsuehshan and Alishan ranges correlates with highs in the 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface (Fig. 8B).\n\n\n\n\n4\nProof of concept\nIn this section, we use a proof of concept approach to test the viability of our interpretation of the reactivation of faults inherited from the continental margin, and basement involvement in the thrusting to explain patterns of seismicity and fault type, GPS derived displacement directions and strain rates, and topography of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt. To do this, we use the 5.2\u00a0km\/s isovelocity surface proxy for the basement-cover interface and the map of the basal thrust as reference frames.\n\n4.1\nSeismicity, GPS, and topography data\n\n4.1.1\nSeismicity\nEarthquake hypocenter data from 1994 through 2014 (Fig. 9\n) was relocated using the double-difference technique (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) within the 3D Vp model of Kuo-Chen et al. (2012) using the HypoDD3D software (Waldhauser, 2001). The relocation was carried out on all events shallower than 25\u00a0km depth that had a minimum of six readings with a reading weighting <3 (good quality). The average horizontal and vertical uncertainties in earthquake locations are estimated to be \u00b11\u00a0km and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0km, respectively, although these uncertainties could be larger (see Wu et al., 2008a; Chen et al., 2017). Within the study area, focal mechanisms were calculated from first motion polarities of P waves (Wu et al., 2008b) for 2465 events with magnitudes between 1.4 to 6.8 ML. Fault types (Fig. 10\n) were calculated using the classification scheme of Zoback (1992).\nIn the 4\u00a0km and 6\u00a0km depth slices, seismicity is taking place above and along the basal thrust, although some clusters in its hanging wall extend into the footwall and the basement below (Fig. 9). In the 4\u00a0km and 8\u00a0km depth slices, seismicity is taking place above the basal thrust where basement is involved in the thrusting. At depths to 16\u00a0km, there is a marked increase in seismicity from north to south across the Choshui lateral structure (CLS), with well-developed hypocenter clusters along the western flank of the Alishan Basement High (ABH), in the southern part of the Central Basement Low (CBL), and in the northern part of the Pingtung Basement Low (PBL). There are very few events around the Peikang Basement High (PBH). There is a significant west to east increase in seismicity into the Hsuehshan Basement High (HBH), with the crust being seismically active to a depth of >20\u00a0km. South of the Choushui lateral structure, scattered seismicity extends west of the interpreted tip line of the basal thrust to a depth of 20\u00a0km.\nThrust and strike-slip fault types are the most common in the study area, with lesser transpressional and rare extensional faulting also taking place (Fig. 10). Strike-slip is the most common fault type to the west of the tip line of the basal thrust and both above and below the basement-cover interface. Strike-slip is also the most common fault type in the upper 5\u00a0km throughout the study area, and in the upper 10\u00a0km along the eastern flank of the thrust belt. Along the Choshui lateral structure, in the 5 to 15\u00a0km depth range, a roughly ENE-striking cluster of strike-slip fault types is located predominantly below the basement-cover interface and below the basal thrust. Between the Choshui lateral structure and the Yichu fault (YF), at this depth range thrust fault types are common near and below the basement-cover interface and below the basal thrust. Along the Yichu fault, strike-slip is the most common fault type in the upper 20\u00a0km, with lesser thrust fault types to a depth of 15\u00a0km. South of the Yichi fault, at 0 to 10\u00a0km depths, scattered thrust and strike-slip fault types occur throughout the area of the Tainan Basement High (TBH), whereas at 10\u201315\u00a0km depth thrust clusters occur along its southern and eastern flank and strike-slip along the west. Both fault types are mostly concentrated below the basement-cover interface and the basal thrust. Along the eastern flank of the thrust belt, where basement is involved in the deformation, strike-slip fault types are common in the upper 10\u00a0km, with thrust types becoming more common with increasing depth.\n\n\n4.1.2\nGPS measurements in the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt\nGPS data from 2005 through 2009 was used to calculate horizontal displacement vectors, maximum shear strain, and vertical rotation rate using the SSPX software of Cardozo and Allmendinger (2009) (Figs. 11\n). The GPS data were processed using the method of Yu et al. (1997) and the reader is referred there for details. Horizontal velocities were calculated relative to station S01R located on the island of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait (Fig. 1). Maximum shear strain and vertical rotation rate were calculated using a 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0km grid and a grid-nearest neighbour interpolation method using the 10 nearest stations within a maximum radius of 35\u00a0km.\nIn the west of the study area, there is an abrupt eastward increase in the horizontal displacement velocity, although there is little apparent relationship with the shape of the basement-cover interface (Figs. 11A). Relative highs in the maximum shear strain and vertical rotation rate take place along the margins of the basement highs and lows, especially the southern part of the NBH, the western margin of the HBH, and the western margin of the PBL (Fig. 11B, C). There are clear changes in the horizontal displacement vectors, maximum shear strain, and vertical rotation rate relative to the ENE-striking faults that breach the basal thrust (Figs. 11D, E, and F). North of the Choshui lateral structure (CLS), displacement is toward the WNW, whereas southward there is a c. 10\u00b0 counter-clockwise rotation of displacement directions, an increase in maximum shear strain, and a change in the sense and in the magnitude of the vertical rotation rate (Fig. 11 D, E, and F). South of the Yichu fault (YF), there is a further 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 counter-clockwise rotation of the horizontal displacement directions and a gradual increase in velocities. This is accompanied by an increase in the maximum shear strain and a marked increase in the vertical rotation rate. South of Hsinhua fault at c. 23\u00b0 N, displacement is toward the southwest, there is a sharp, local increase in the maximum shear strain, and the vertical rotation rate changes from clockwise to counter-clockwise.\n\n\n4.1.3\nTopography of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt\nA 40-m pixel digital elevation model was used to investigate whether or not there is any relationship between the topography of the fold-and-trust belt, the basement-cover interface, and the geometry of the basal thrust and (Fig. 12\n).\nThroughout the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt, there is a good correlation between high topography and basement highs, with the highest topography above the Hsuehshan (HBH) and Alishan (ABH) highs, and lower topography across the Tainan (TBH) and Northern (NBH) highs (Fig. 12A). There is no high topography associated with the Peikang Basement High (PBH). The high topography along the eastern margin of the fold-and-thrust belt is developed above the area where basement is involved in the thrusting (Fig. 12B). Across the Choshui lateral structure (CLS), there is a roughly ENE-striking, north to south increase in topography of >2000\u00a0m into the Alishan ranges that coincides with the NNW-facing Choshui lateral culmination wall (Fig. 7). Similarly, but with lesser effect, there is a clear topographic signature associated with the Yichu fault. South of the Yichu fault (YF), the topography is comprised of southward-plunging, long, narrow, curved ridges that correlated with changes in strike of thrusts across the Yichu (YOR) and Hsinhua (HOR) oblique ramps.\n\n\n\n4.2\nTesting the viability of the model\nIn our model of the structure of the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt (i.e. Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017; Biete et al., 2018), fault reactivation is taking place along a Miocene-aged ENE-striking extensional fault system that has been traced from offshore in the Taiwan Strait into the Coastal Plain of southwestern Taiwan (Chang, 1963, 1964; Lin et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2016). In the model, reactivation of this fault system is responsible for the along-strike changes across the Choshui lateral structure, and the Yichu and Hsinhua faults. We suggest that much of the seismicity below the basal thrust can be explained by slip along ENE-striking faults that bound basement highs and lows inherited from the margin. These faults are favorably orientated for strike-slip and transpressional reactivation in the contemporaneous stress field of southwest Taiwan (e.g., Suppe, 1995; Lacombe et al., 1999; Mouthereau and Lacombe, 2006; Mouthereau et al., 2009; Biete et al., 2019), which can explain the widespread occurrence of this fault type in the focal mechanism data. Our interpretation that these reactivated faults breach the basal thrust and affect the surface deformation of the fold-and-thrust belt can explain the variations observed in the GPS displacement directions, shear strain rate, and vertical rotation rate that takes place across the Choshui lateral structure, the Yichi fault, and the Hsinhua fault. SW-directed displacement and high strain rates in the southwest can possibly be explained by slip taking place along the Hsinhua oblique ramp, which is forming along the flank of the Pingtung Basement Low (Fig. 8B). Our model is less successful, however, in explaining the seismicity above the basal thrust, except along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt where it is interpreted to ramp down into the crystalline basement. This interpretation of a ramp in the basal thrust can explain the deepening of seismicity in these areas (Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017; Biete et al., 2018) and the oblique displacement mapped along the Shuilikeng, Lishan, and Chaochou faults (see also, Lee et al., 1997; Wiltschko et al., 2010; Camanni et al., 2014b; Kuo-Chen et al., 2015) can explain the distribution of strike-slip and thrust fault types in the Hsuehshan and Alishan ranges. Our interpretation that the basal thrust ramps down into the crystalline basement also explains the development of high topography (see also, Mouthereau et al., 2002), a relationship also found in other mountain belts (e.g., Kley et al., 1996; Mouthereau et al., 2006; Pfiffner, 2017).\nOn the basis of the proof of concept analyses presented in this section, we suggest that our interpretations of along-strike changes being caused by the reactivation of ENE-striking faults inherited from the margin and of basement involvement in the thrusting are viable since they can explain the first-order patterns of seismicity, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, and topography data. We stress, however, that other models (e.g., Wu et al., 1997; Mouthereau et al., 2009; Ching et al., 2011) may also explain these data sets and can therefore be considered viable.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nAlthough there are important differences between the many structural models for the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt (e.g., Suppe, 1980, 1981, 1986; Mouthereau et al., 2001; Hickman et al., 2002; Yue et al., 2005; Mouthereau and Lacombe, 2006; Yang et al., 2007, 2016; Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko, 2010), most authors, including us (e.g., Brown et al., 2012, 2017; Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2014a, 2016; Biete et al., 2018), interpret it to be an imbricate thrust system. The major differences between the models revolve around, 1) the location and nature of the basal thrust, 2) whether or not there are transverse structures and if so, what is causing them, 3) whether or not there is basement involvement in the thrusting, 4) the amount of shortening and, 5) the structure of the Hsuehshan Range.\nThe basal thrust is a key structure in the interpretation of any fold-and-thrust belt, since its geometry and location (depth) has important implications for the deformation style, the mechanics, and the involvement (or not) of basement in the deformation (e.g., Davis et al., 1983; Judge and Allmendinger, 2011; Poblet and Lisle, 2011; Pfiffner, 2017; Lacombe and Bellahsen, 2016; Tavani et al., 2021). Therefore, a map of the basal thrust, even with its uncertainties, is an important tool for understanding the structure of a fold-and-thrust belt (e.g., shortening, basement involvement) and how (or if) it is affected by activity in its footwall (e.g., fault reactivation and the formation of transverse zones). In this paper, we have used new geological surface mapping, serial cross-sections, strike-parallel sections, and a proxy for the basement-cover interface to map the location and geometry of the basal thrust throughout the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 8). Most other interpretations of the basal thrust in this area are 2D (cross section), with the exception of Huang et al. (2004) and Carena et al. (2002) who map parts of its surface. Our proposal for the geometry and depth of the basal thrust (Fig. 8) differs from that of Hung et al. (1999), Mouthereau et al. (2001, 2002), Carena et al. (2002), Hickman et al. (2002), Yue et al. (2005), Yang et al. (2007, 2016), and Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko (2010) who interpret it to be deeper than in our model, or even that there are two levels of detachment. Lacombe and Mouthereau (2002) and Mouthereau and Lacombe (2006) suggest that there may even be a deep, ductile detachment. Furthermore, we interpret the basal thrust to ramp down into the middle crust along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt, unlike Suppe (1980, 1981), Carena et al. (2002), Yue et al. (2005), and Malavieille and Trullenque (2009) who suggest that it is a through-going detachment near the base of the sedimentary package across the entire mountain belt.\nOur structural mapping allows us to interpret the presence of two well-defined ENE-striking transverse zones (the Choshui lateral structure and the Yichu fault), and one lesser one (the Hsinhua fault) (Figs. 5A and 8A). Transverse zones are defined as \u201ca systematic alignment of lateral connectors between two sets of differing structures\u201d (Thomas, 1990). They are syn-kinematic with respect to fold-and-thrust belt structures and are possibly controlled by reactivated basement faults, mechanical variations along the basal thrust, or a combination of these (Thomas, 1990). We suggest that the transverse zones identified in the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt have a causal relationship to the east-northeast striking faults that have been mapped on the margin and traced into the western Taiwan (Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014; Camanni et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2017; Biete et al., 2018, 2019). This interpretation is in agreement with that of Mouthereau and Lacombe (2006) who suggested the presence of ENE-trending structures and their relationship to basement faults. We provide a proof of concept analysis that suggests that this interpretation can explain the distribution of seismicity and fault types, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, as well as the topography of the study area. Further support for the interpretation is provided by the dextral strike-slip surface ruptures developed during the 1906 Meishan and the 1946 Hsinhua earthquakes (Bonilla, 1975; Shyu et al., 2005, 2016). Nevertheless, a number of other studies (e.g., Deffontaines et al., 1997; Lacombe et al., 1999; Mouthereau et al., 1999, 2002) have suggested that several roughly NW-striking transfer (sic) zones affect the structure of the Taiwan fold-and-thrust. These transfer zones were interpreted to be related to either pre-existing extensional faults in the under-thrusting margin, to deformation taking place along the margins of basement highs, or as newly formed structures in the hanging wall of the fold-and-thrust belt (e.g., Deffontaines et al., 1997; Lacombe et al., 1999; Mouthereau et al., 1999, 2002). However, NW-striking faults have not been reported from the part of the margin that is entering into the deformation in south-central Taiwan; Eocene-age rift basins having NE-striking bounding faults (Hsu, 2001; Lin and Watts, 2002; Lin et al., 2003; Teng and Lin, 2004; Lin et al., 2005), and Miocene-aged basins have ENE-striking bounding faults (Lee et al., 1993; Lin et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2008; Tang and Zheng, 2010; Yang et al., 1991, 2016; Yeh et al., 2012; McIntosh et al., 2014). Furthermore, we find no concrete evidence in our mapping to support the presence of regional, NW-striking transfer zones that affect the fold-and-thrust belt.\nIn the absence of other data, using a proxy of 5.2\u00a0km\/s (Fig. 3) for the basement - cover interface provides a way forward for the interpretation of the involvement of crystalline basement rocks in the thrusting in the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt. The definition of basement as crystalline rocks used in this paper differs from that of other authors who generally define basement in Taiwan as any pre-Miocene rocks (e.g., Hung et al., 1999; Mouthereau et al., 2001, 2002; Lacombe and Mouthereau, 2002; Hickman et al., 2002; Lacombe et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2004; Mouthereau and Lacombe, 2006; Yang et al., 2007, 2016; Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko, 2010) and interpret basement involvement in the thrusting, even along the westernmost flank of the fold-and-thrust belt. As we indicate in Section 3.2.2, there is widespread evidence that the basal thrust is near the base of the Pliocene Cholan Fm in the north of the study are and within the middle Miocene Nanchuang Fm in the south, indicating that basement is not involved in the thrusting along the western part of the thrust belt. The eastern flank of the thrust belt, however, can be interpreted to involve crystalline basement (Vp >5.2\u00a0km\/s), albeit with two different styles. Using the terminology of Poblet and Lisle (2011) and Pfiffner (2017), the structural style of the Hsuehshan Range can be interpreted as thick-skinned with the basal thrust ramping steeply into the basement, reactivating an Eocene-aged extensional fault to a depth of 20\u00a0km or more (see also, Brown et al., 2012; Camanni et al., 2014a, 2014b; Kuo-Chen et al., 2015), whereas the Alishan Range, with a thin sheet of crystalline basement rocks (Alvarez-Marron et al., 2014), appears to be basement-involved (Fig. 6).\nIn our cross section interpretations, shortening in the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt is larger in the north (> 25\u00a0km), decreasing across the Choshui lateral structure and southwards through the Alishan Ranges (c. 15\u00a0km), before increasing southward (17 to 25\u00a0km) across the Yichu fault (Table 1). Our shortening estimates are in keeping with those of between 10\u00a0km to 30\u00a0km made by Yang et al. (2006, 2007, 2016), Mouthereau et al. (2001), Hickman et al. (2002), Mouthereau and Petit (2003), Mouthereau and Lacombe (2006), and Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko (2010). It is, however, in sharp contrast to the interpretations of Suppe (1980, 1986) whose sections, if restored (cross sections are not restored and shortening values are not mentioned in these publications), record >87\u00a0km of shortening along our section 5, and >50\u00a0km of shortening along the frontal part of our sections 7 through 10. In our sections 7 through 10, for example, placing the basal thrust at c. 1\u00a0km to 2\u00a0km depth along the front of the thrust system and a ramp to the east (to c. 4\u00a0km depth) allows us to accommodate the surface bedding dips by interpreting a fault bend fold whose back limb is cut by a thrust. Suppe (1980) interprets a complex duplex and antiformal stack structure that involves much more shortening. Nevertheless, Suppe (1980) indicates that \u201c\u2026given the large number of imbrications needed to satisfy the surface dips, considerable rearrangement of the faults and decollement horizons may be possible.\u201d, and that there \u201c\u2026is a major problem with this provisional cross section\u2026\u201d. We suggest that the simpler solutions presented by us and by Mouthereau et al. (2001), Mouthereau and Petit (2003), Mouthereau and Lacombe (2006), Yang et al. (2006, 2016), and Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko (2010) provide a more accurate interpretation of the structure and more realistic estimates of the amount of shortening.\nMapping in the Hsuehshan Range has provided extensive new structural data, including the recognition of structures cut by the Shuilikeng fault, a regional-scale anticlinorium in the hanging wall of the Tili thrust, a zone of ductile deformation along the Lishan fault, a vertical east-facing limb along the Lishan fault (Brown et al., 2012). Furthermore, our geological mapping along >100\u00a0km of the strike length of the Shuilikeng fault (e.g., Brown et al., 2012; Camanni et al., 2014b) showed it to have a complex displacement history and to truncate structures in both its footwall and hanging wall (Fig. 5), suggesting that it has a long and varied history of oblique, out-of-sequence thrusting. These structures were not recognised previously in the structural interpretations of this part of the fold-and-thrust belt. For example, Suppe (1986) interprets the Shuilikeng fault to be an east-dipping hanging wall flat that merges with a basal detachment at about 8\u00a0km depth beneath the Hsuehshan Range, whereas Mouthereau et al. (2002) interpret it (their Chushih thrust) to penetrate into the basement (which they define as any pre-Miocene rocks), but without any detachment being interpreted. Yue et al. (2005) interpret the Shuilikeng fault to be a west-dipping extensional fault that has been cut and transported westward, leaving its seismically active lower part in the footwall to the detachment. Rodriguez-Roa and Wiltschko (2010), interpret the Shuilikeng fault (their Tulungwan thrust) to extend from central Taiwan to the south where it becomes the Chaochou fault, and to merge with a basal detachment in the Miocene. Although Yue et al. (2005) interpret the surface structure of the westernmost part of the Hsuehshan Range in a similar way to us they interpret the eastern part, from the Tili thrust to the Lishan fault, to be an east-dipping monocline with the structure of a hanging wall flat, as does Suppe (1986). Neither Yue et al. (2005), nor Suppe (1986) recognise the Lishan fault. Only Clark et al. (1993) suggest that the Hsuehshan Range is a pop-up structure that inverts the extensional Hsuehshan Basin, which is in keeping with our interpretations. Other authors, such as Lin et al. (2003) and Teng and Lin (2004) do hint that tectonic inversion is taking place in the Hsuehshan Range (for example, see Fig. 3 of Lin et al., 2003), but they do not explicitly say so.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we bring together the results of our previous studies and add new data and data analyses to develop a 3D structural model for the structure of south-central Taiwan. We interpret the fold-and-thrust belt to be a west-verging, imbricate thrust system developed above a single basal thrust that is breached by ENE-striking strike-slip to transpressive faults that are developed along the flanks of basement highs and low. These breaching faults are inherited from the continental margin and are associated with ENE-striking transverse zones in the fold-and-thrust belt. Across these transverse zones there are changes in a combination of stratigraphy, structural style, strike and dip of the basal thrust, and uplift of the stratigraphic contacts. Along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt, the uplift of rocks with Vp\u00a0>\u00a05.2\u00a0km\/s leads us to interpret crystalline basement to be involved in the thrusting. Shortening estimates range from 15\u00a0km to >25\u00a0km and varies across the transverse zones. While our proposed structural model has many similarities and differences with those of other authors, we suggest that its depth and along-strike consistency, together with is ability to explain aspects of the distribution of seismicity, faults types, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, and topography of the study area makes it a viable model.\n\n","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe East African Rift System (EARS) is the largest active tectonic structure illustrating the early stage of continental plate fragmentation (e.g., Girdler et al., 1969). It is classically described as made of several extensional basins, two large plateaux, and many volcanic formations of variable spatial extent (Chorowicz, 2005). Indeed, magmatism is widespread and voluminous in the East branch, while it is concentrated in small and scattered volcanic provinces in the West branch and its seaward extension in the Mozambique channel (Fig. 1\n; Chorowicz, 2005). This striking difference of distribution is responsible for a long-standing debate regarding the link between volcanism and deformation (e.g., Rosendahl, 1987; Bailey, 1992). On the one hand, the EARS may be viewed as entirely (Oxburgh and Turcotte, 1974), or partially (Corti et al., 2003; Armitage et al., 2015) resulting from the deformation of the African lithosphere under far-field stresses, with volcanism being the response of lithospheric deformation as in passive rifts. On the other hand, the coeval occurrence of continental flood basalts and plateau uplift, both prior to extensional basin formation, may arise from one or several mantle plume impingements below the African continental lithosphere as in active rifts (Seng\u00f6r and Burke, 1978; Hill, 1991; George et al., 1998; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998). Between these two extreme views (plate vs. plume-driven volcano-tectonics; Anderson, 2005, Foulger, 2010), intermediate models involving plume-related buoyancy forces, gravitational potential energy (GPE), basal shear traction, magma-assisted rifting and\/or far-field stresses have been proposed to explain the development of the EARS (e.g., Bialas et al., 2010; Kendall and Lithgow-Bertelloni, 2016; Min and Hou, 2018), the coeval openings of the magma-rich eastern and magma-poor western branches (Koptev et al., 2015), or the current plate kinematics (Stamps et al., 2015). All these models remain equally plausible yet undemonstrated as long as the relative influence of plate tectonics and plumes is not evaluated in time (since the initiation of the EARS), and in space (from Afar to the South-West Indian Ridge as defined by kinematic models; e.g., Stamps et al., 2018). In other words, which manifestation, volcanism or lithospheric deformation, occurred first during the EARS evolution over its total extent?\nTo answer this pivotal question and re-investigate the causes and dynamics of magmatism and extension in the EARS, we (1) clarify the geometry of the rift system, (2) build a comprehensive database of radiometric ages of magmatic activity, taking advantage of decades of published geochronological research, (3) propose a critical review of the published periods of extension from Afar to the Mozambique channel, and (4) interpret the spatio-temporal distribution of the EARS volcanic and tectonic activity in integrating both regional plate and mantle dynamics.\n\n\n2\nPre-EARS African plate fragmentation\nBefore the Eocene, the eastern part of the African plate experienced several periods of extension that contributed to the fragmentation of the Gondwana (e.g., Macgregor, 2018, for a review). First, the poly-phased Karoo rifting event dated from the Middle Permian to the Middle Jurassic led to the development of a\u00a0~\u00a03000\u00a0km-long system of grabens parallel to the east continental margin of the current African continent (Fig. 2a; Castaing, 1991; Catuneanu et al., 2005). It was followed by the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous southward drift of Madagascar along the Davie ridge main transfer zone, which opened the Mozambique and Somali basins (Coffin and Rabinowitz, 1987; Cochran, 1988), and by the early Cretaceous extension in Kenya and South Sudan, which opened the NW-SE-striking Anza, Muglad, Blue Nile, and Melut grabens (Guiraud and Maurin, 1992; Ebinger et al., 2000) and the Rukwa rift between the Tanganyika and Zambia cratons (Fig. 2b; Roberts et al., 2010). Finally, during the Upper Cretaceous and Early Paleogene, extension resumed in the Anza, Muglad and Melut grabens until a regional inversion in the Eocene (Bosworth, 1992; Guiraud and Bosworth, 1997). The Eocene period corresponds to the onset of the first volcanic activity attributed to the EARS, in the Turkana area around 45\u00a0Ma, between the Muglad and Anza grabens (Ebinger et al., 1993a; George et al., 1998). Thus, in a similar fashion to Macgregor (2015), we consider the Middle Eocene magmatic activity as the starting point of the evolution of the EARS, even if a younger age (Late Eocene) has been proposed by Morley et al. (1999a) from sedimentary infill in the Turkana Broadly Rifted Zone. Interestingly, these Middle and Late Eocene ages correspond to the initiation of the incipient separation (Hempton, 1987) and effective extension between Africa and Arabia (Bosworth et al., 2005; Bellahsen et al., 2006), suggesting that a broader plate reorganisation started at this time in the framework of Africa-Eurasia convergence (Hempton, 1987; Jolivet and Faccenna, 2000).\n\n\n3\nGeometry of the East African Rift System\nThere is no consensus over the extent of the EARS. Mostly based on the distribution of grabens, the EARS is often defined as a tectonic structure limited to the African continental lithosphere, made of two branches, East and West, and an incipient South-West continuity along the Okavango rift zone (Fig. 1a; Ebinger et al., 1989a, 1993b; Modisi et al., 2000; Kinabo et al., 2007; Pastier et al., 2017). However, marine geophysics suggests that the EARS not only affects the African continent but continues in the Mozambique channel along the Davie Ridge (Mougenot et al., 1986; Franke et al., 2015), forming a Southeastern branch (Fig. 1a; Chorowicz, 2005). Recent offshore surveys have evidenced a southward continuity of this segment along the Quatlamba seismic axis (Courgeon et al., 2016, 2017; Deville et al., 2018). Furthermore, the development of N-S trending grabens in Madagascar since the Pliocene (like the Alaotra graben; Piqu\u00e9 et al., 1999; Kusky et al., 2010) could represent the easternmost manifestation of the plate extension (Fig. 1a; Kusky et al., 2010; Michon, 2016). In addition, kinematic models suggest that the EARS spreads out from Afar to the Southwest Indian Ridge along segments that delimit lithospheric blocks\/plates between the Somali and Nubia plates (Fig. 1a; Hartnady, 1990; Jestin et al., 1994; Calais et al., 2006; Horner-Johnson et al., 2007).\nIn the present study, we use the spatial coexistence of Tertiary volcanic activity, Oligocene-to-present tectonics, and seismicity, as criteria to delineate the segments of long-term plate deformation and volcanism of the EARS. The occurrence of volcanism, which is mostly mafic in the EARS (e.g., Furman, 2007), evidences mantle melting due to either rift-induced lithospheric thinning and\/or mantle anomaly impingement, whereas the past tectonics and current seismicity give insights into the past and active lithospheric deformation. Compiled in Fig. 1b, these criteria confirm the geometry of the East and West branches and the occurrence of an offshore continuity along the northern part of the Davie ridge, which was named the Southeastern branch by Chorowicz (2005). Recent offshore data reveal (1) that a late Cenozoic volcanism and deformation occurred along the southern part of the Davie ridge (Courgeon et al., 2018) and (2) that this segment is connected to the Quatlamba axis (Deville et al., 2018) and the Natal province, where it merges with the N-S trending West branch (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the offshore continuity may also extend toward the Comoros archipelago, formerly interpreted as a hotspot track (Emerick and Duncan, 1982; Class et al., 1998). However, the alignment of the Comoros is not consistent with the absolute motions of the Somali or Lwandle plates (Wang et al., 2018). Furthermore, we recently showed that the coexistence of en-\u00e9chelon Quaternary volcanic lineaments in the archipelago, of focused seismic activity with dominant strike-slip focal mechanisms (Bertil and Regnoult, 1998; Lemoine et al., 2020), and of prominent strike slip faulting affecting the islands since at least 1\u00a0Ma, all indicate that the Comoros archipelago is a right-lateral boundary between the Lwandle and Somali plates rather than a hotspot track (Famin et al., 2020). Such a right-lateral displacement between the Somali and Lwandle plates along the Comoros archipelago is consistent with GPS data (e.g., Stamps et al., 2018). The coexistence of volcanism, N-S grabens and seismicity in Madagascar suggests that the plate boundary forms a 90\u00b0 sharp bend toward the south. Thus, we propose that the Comoros and Madagascar segments form a fourth branch in the EARS, which we call the Indian Ocean branch. The concentration of magmatism, faults and earthquakes along the volcano-tectonic corridors of the Comoros archipelago, the Davie ridge, Madagascar and the Quatlamba axis, suggests that the South-East and Indian Ocean branches are likely not a diffuse deforming zone as proposed by Kusky et al. (2010) and Stamps et al. (2018, 2021), but rather delineates the Lwandle plate.\n\n\n4\nMaterial and methods\n\n4.1\nDating volcanism\nTo refine the history of volcanic activity along the EARS, we compiled the published georeferenced radiometric ages available for Tertiary magmatic rocks over the East, West and South-East branches (Fig. 3a). Instead of integrating all the published ages since the pioneer work of Evernden et al. (1957), we applied the following procedure to ensure the robustness of the database. (1) Radiometric studies older than 1980 were not considered because dating methods of young mafic igneous rocks were still under development at that time. We made three exceptions to this rule for Gromm\u00e9 et al. (1970), Fairhead et al. (1972) and Hajash and Armstrong (1972), because they corroborated their radiometric ages with paleomagnetic polarities. The initial database was thus composed of 1179 radiometric ages available in 81 publications (Fig. 3a, b; Supplementary Table S1; all the references are in Supplementary Material). (2) Age uncertainties were homogenized to the 2\u03c3 level. Data presenting high 2 sigma uncertainties with respect to their age were rejected with the following relative uncertainty cut-offs: >5%, >10%, >12.5%, >15%, >20%, >30%, >50%, and\u00a0>\u00a0100% for ages >30\u00a0Ma, between >15\u201330\u00a0Ma, between >10\u201315\u00a0Ma, between >5\u201310\u00a0Ma, between >2.5\u20135\u00a0Ma, between >1\u20132.5\u00a0Ma, between 0.25 and 1\u00a0Ma and\u00a0<\u00a00.25\u00a0Ma, respectively (Fig. 3c). This step eliminated 16.1% of the initial database. (3) Forty-five radiometric ages (i) described as in contradiction with stratigraphic successions, (ii) obtained on samples presenting evidence of significant alteration, or (iii) poorly constrained from their dating method (e.g., absence of plateau for the 40Ar\/39Ar approach) were not integrated in the final database. (4) All the radiometric ages using the 40K decay were recalculated with the same decay constant, and ages determined with the 40Ar\/39Ar method were recalculated with the same standard (Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine at 28.201\u00a0Ma; Kuiper et al., 2008). This entire filtering procedure resulted in the rejection of 233 radiometric ages (20% of the initial database; Supplementary Table S2), with the advantage of minimizing the inevitable oversampling of the most studied volcanic provinces and periods.\nOur final database is made of 946 radiometric ages (761, 85, 6 and 94 data for the East, West, South-East and Indian Ocean branches, respectively; Fig. 3a) in which K-Ar, 40Ar\/39Ar and U-Pb, Rb-Sr or (U-Th-Sm)\/He ages account for 72%, 27%, and 1% of the database, respectively (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Table S3). This comprehensive database provides a useful representation of volcanic periods, but it must be kept in mind that non-systematic sampling may result in temporal and spatial biases that cannot be avoided. Furthermore, it must be stressed that the abundance or scarcity of radiometric ages for a given volcanic period does not provide any insight regarding the volume of emitted magma, but only indicates that the area experienced volcanism at that time.\n\n\n4.2\nDating rifting initiation\nTo assess the potential genetic link between lithospheric deformation and magmatism, we synthesised the documented periods of extension that affected the EARS since the Middle Eocene, from Afar to the Mozambique channel (Fig. 4\n; Supplementary Table S4; all the references are in Supplementary Material). We compiled 63 publications in which the periods of rifting have been dated from radiometric ages of pre-, syn- and\/or post-rift volcanic products (e.g., McDougall and Watkins, 1988; Behrensmeyer et al., 2002; Roberts et al., 2012b; Stab et al., 2016), from apatite fission track or (U-Th-Sm)\/He thermochronology (Spiegel et al., 2007; Pik et al., 2008; Philippon et al., 2014; Torres Acosta et al., 2015; Balestrieri et al., 2016; Boone et al., 2018), from biostratigraphy (e.g., Kent et al., 1971; Suwa et al., 1991; Bromage et al., 1995; Simon et al., 2017; Courgeon et al., 2018), or, in areas lacking any volcanic or paleontological markers, from indirect methods such as seismic reflection, orbital stratigraphy and rates of sediment accumulation or rift propagation (e.g., Morley, 1988; Mougenot et al., 1989; Cohen et al., 1993; Franke et al., 2015; McCartney and Scholz, 2016; Ponte et al., 2019).\nFor each publication, we made a critical review of the criteria used to accurately date the rift initiation and the periods of extension and therefore rated the proposed ages of extension as strongly, moderately and weakly constrained (Fig. 4; published periods of extension in Supplementary Table S4). Rifting events dated with radiometric dating of volcanic formations were rated as follows. The robustness of radiometric ages that were used to date rifting events was first checked considering the approach described in section 4.1. We therefore did not consider in most cases the periods of rifting dated with ages that we rejected, but exceptionally kept rifting events dated with radiometric data obtained before 1980, when these data were the only available to date extension. The latter were rated as weakly constrained. For extension initiation dated using pre- and syn-rift lava units whose radiometric ages were considered as reliable, we computed an average age from the proposed pre- and syn-rift dates. Ages of rift initiation were then considered as strongly, moderately and weakly constrained when the time span between the pre- and syn-rift dates accounts for <10%, between 10 and 30% and\u00a0>\u00a030% of the average age, respectively (see the example of the Afar segment in Supplementary Table S4; Ukstins et al., 2002; Wolfenden et al., 2005; Stab et al., 2016). Rifting events dated with pre- and post-rift formations (e.g., McDougall and Watkins, 1988; Boschetto et al., 1992) were considered as moderately constrained since the pre-rift unit provided only a maximum age for rift initiation. Several periods of rifting have been dated from the thickening of a volcanic unit in the grabens (e.g., Wolfenden et al., 2005). As the thickening of the volcanic formation only indicates the existence of a topographic depression, it provides a minimum age of rift initiation. Rift initiations dated with syn-rift formations were consequently considered as weakly constrained. Yet, the occurrence of syn-tectonic units (Wolfenden et al., 2004) or several syn-rift volcanic units interstratified in sediments (e.g., Boschetto et al., 1992; McDougall and Brown, 2008) were considered as reliable features to accurately date periods of extension and were thus rated as moderately constrained. Finally, rifting events dated from radiometric ages of volcanic intrusions (e.g., Bonini et al., 2005) or of off-rift volcanic vents (e.g., Ebinger et al., 2000; Ebinger et al., 1993b) were rated as weakly constrained because off-rift volcanism has been shown to be primarily controlled by topography effects rather than regional extension stresses (Maccaferri et al., 2014).\nThe exhumation of rift shoulders related to major extension events have been dated by apatite fission track analysis or (U-Th)\/He thermochronology (Spiegel et al., 2007; Pik et al., 2008; Philippon et al., 2014; Torres Acosta et al., 2015; Balestrieri et al., 2016; Boone et al., 2018). In these different studies, the onset of rapid exhumation determined from thermal models was considered as indicative of rift initiation. We rated these ages as moderately constrained except when the results were contradicted by more recent thermochronometry data and radiometric ages. They were consequently lowered to weakly constrained (e.g., Spiegel et al., 2007 for the Northern Gregory rift).\nIn areas lacking volcanic rocks to date the periods of extension, molluscs, vertebrates, pollens, spores, nannofossils or planktonic foraminifers embedded in the syn-rift sediments have tentatively been used to determine the age of the rifting events. The dating accuracy depends on the specificities of the fossil assemblages. We therefore rated as weakly constrained the periods of rifting determined from a fauna poorly characteristic of a given period, as in Madagascar for the Pliocene extension (B\u00e9sairie, 1960; Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, fauna assemblages representative of a specific period were considered as moderately to strongly constrained depending on the existence of additional methods to date the rifting events (e.g., E.M. Roberts et al., 2012b; Simon et al., 2017).\nFinally, the graben structure of several segments of the EARS have been imaged from reflection seismology and dated from the stratigraphy deduced in deep drill holes, the estimate or determination of Quaternary or current sedimentation rates, dated intercalated lava units, or estimates of rift lateral propagation. In general, we rated as weakly and moderately constrained the rifting periods dated from the extrapolation of current and Quaternary accumulation rates, respectively. The ages of periods of rifting dated by the stratigraphy recorded in deep wells were considered as weakly constrained since the time span between the identified horizon frequently exceeds several million years (duration of 4\u20138\u00a0Myrs of the epochs of the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene), making estimation of the initiation of fault activity imprecise. Finally, the determination of the age of rift initiation from estimates of rift southward propagation (e.g., the Lacerda graben in the Mozambique channel; Franke et al., 2015) is rated as weakly constrained because more recent results indicate that rifting initiated at the Middle-Late Miocene transition in the southern Mozambique channel (Deville et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nSpatio-temporal distribution of volcanism\nAt first glance, the compilation confirms that the East branch underwent an onset of volcanism in the Middle Eocene (Fig. 5a), ~20\u00a0Ma earlier than the West, South-East and Indian Ocean branches (Fig. 5b, c and d). It also shows a simultaneous initiation of magmatic activity, dated with several radiometric methods, since the Upper Oligocene in both West and Indian Ocean branches. This early coeval activity is hardly compatible with the progressive outward influence of the Afar plume proposed by Ebinger and Sleep (1998).\nThus, we subdivided the EARS into several volcanic provinces based on their structural specificities (Fig. 6\n) to evaluate potential differences in the evolution of each branch, for instance due to the influence of one or several mantle plumes, as discussed by Emerick and Duncan (1982), Ebinger and Sleep (1998), and George et al. (1998). For the East branch, we took into account the topographic low made by the Turkana broadly rifted zone (TBRZ) between the Ethiopian and Kenyan plateaux (Fig. 1b; George et al., 1998) and its precursory extension (Macgregor, 2015; Morley et al., 1992) to distinguish it as a separate volcanic province located between those of the Afar - Ethiopian plateau (AEP) in the north, and the Gregory - Nyanza rifts (GNR) in the south (Fig. 6). The West branch was subdivided into two distinct volcanic provinces, Kivu - N Tanganyika and Rungwe, based on the gap of volcanism between them. The South-East branch is the least dated of the EARS with only six ages. We therefore prefer to consider it as a single volcanic province instead of two provinces characterized by three dates each, i.e., the Natal and Quatlamba seismic axis. Lastly, the Indian Ocean branch has been subdivided into two volcanic provinces: (1) the Comoros archipelago, the northern tip of Madagascar, and the submarine edifices in-between, and (2) the central and southern parts of Madagascar. Following our revised geometry of the EARS, these two provinces developed along the E-W and N-S boundaries between the Lwandle and Somali plates (Fig. 6).\nOur subdivision of the EARS\u2019 branches into volcanic provinces may be applied to the database of radiometric ages in order to explore the temporal evolution of magmatic activity (Fig. 6). In this temporal evolution, some features were already noticed by previous studies. For instance, the volcanic activity of the East branch was almost exclusively restricted to the TBRZ during the Eocene, consisting first in a few initial eruptions around 40\u201345\u00a0Ma and followed by a bimodal emission of flood basalts and rhyolitic ignimbrites around 35\u201337\u00a0Ma that emitted around 30\u2013100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0km3 of lava (Ebinger et al., 1993a, 2000; McDougall and Brown, 2009; McDougall and Watkins, 2006). At that time, a very limited activity was found in the AEP volcanic province (George et al., 1998). The main magmatic event of the East branch occurred around 30\u00a0Ma with the emplacement of the Ethiopian traps in the AEP province. This event emitted around 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0km3 (Mohr, 1983; Ebinger et al., 1993a) in a short time span (Hofmann et al., 1997). Our compilation shows that the TBRZ and AEP provinces experienced a relatively different discontinuous activity until half of the Lower Miocene, as a volume of around 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0km3 of flood basalts and rhyolitic ignimbrites (the Kenyan volcanics) was emitted in both the TBRZ and the Gregory - Nyanza volcanic province at 11\u201319\u00a0Ma (Williams, 1982; Itaya and Sawada, 1987; Boschetto et al., 1992; George et al., 1998; McDougall and Feibel, 1999; Ebinger et al., 1993a, 2000; Behrensmeyer et al., 2002), while the AEP province became almost quiescent (Fig. 6). The magmas emitted during these periods of intense volcanic activity display tholeiitic to alkaline compositions (e.g., Fitch et al., 1985; Hart et al., 1989; Kampunzu and Mohr, 1991; Kieffer et al., 2004; Furman, 2007).\nMore remarkably, our subdivision also reveals that the Indian Ocean and West branches present a nearly similar temporal evolution of magmatism. They experienced an Upper Oligocene and Lower Miocene discontinuous activity, a quiescence over most of the Middle Miocene, followed by a coeval resumption of activity around 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma in 3 of the 4 volcanic provinces, and finally a generalised volcanism from the Upper Miocene onward in all the provinces (Fig. 6). It is worth noting that the Central - South Madagascar volcanic province is still active despite a lack of radiometric ages, as indicated by the Pleistocene-Holocene Itasy and Vakinankaratra volcanic fields (Fig. 6; Rufer et al., 2014; Melluso et al., 2018). Furthermore, the evolution of the Indian Ocean and West branches is remarkably similar to that of the submarine edifices of the South-East branch that displayed an Upper Oligocene \u2013 Lower Miocene main building period, followed by an Upper Miocene \u2013 Pleistocene discontinuous activity (Fig. 6; Courgeon et al., 2017; O'Connor et al., 2019; Berthod et al., 2022). Magmas emitted in the West, Indian Ocean and South-East branches not only show a similar timing, but also share identical chemical affinities of the silica-saturated, silica-undersaturated alkaline, and melilitic-carbonatitic suites (e.g., Kampunzu and Mohr, 1991; Sp\u00e4th et al., 1996; Rudnick et al., 1993; Furman, 2007; Pelleter et al., 2014; Mazzeo et al., 2021; Berthod et al., 2022).\nA key result arising from our compilation of radiometric ages is that the common evolution described above is not limited to the West, South-East and Indian Ocean branches, but is also observed in the distant AEP province (Fig. 7\n). These different provinces are all characterized by an Upper Oligocene \/ Lower Miocene discontinuous volcanism with coeval peaks, a significant hiatus during most of the Middle Miocene (12.5\u201315\u00a0Ma) and a volcanic renewal from 12 to 12.5\u00a0Ma on (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the volcanic episode recorded between around 17\u201318.5\u00a0Ma in all the provinces initiated at the same time as the Kenyan volcanics in the TBRZ and Nyanza rift (Fitch et al., 1985; Drake et al., 1988).\nThe TBRZ and GNR provinces share a magmatic evolution that differs from the other provinces. They underwent an intense volcanic activity at 11\u201319\u00a0Ma and present a hiatus between 9.1 and 7.4\u00a0Ma, confirmed in the field by the lack of volcanic deposits in the sediments and by an angular unconformity (Sawada et al., 1987; Tatsumi and Kimura, 1991; McDougall and Feibel, 1999).\nImportantly, we can rule out a possible effect of our filtering of age data in the results described above because the latter still stand when integrating all the ages of the initial pre-filtering database (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. S1b).\n\n\n5.2\nTiming of extension\nOur compilation of the periods of extension along the entire EARS reveals that several ages of rifting have been proposed for a given rifting event on a given rift segment, sometimes quite in disagreement with each other (Fig. 4). We therefore used the rating of the ages used to date extension, from weak to strong as described in section 4.2, to select the most reliable ages. To do so, we first considered for each rift segment the ages of a given extension period with highest rating. Then, several possibilities may occur. When the highest rating corresponds to a single date, it corresponds to the age reported in Fig. 8a. When several highest rating corresponding to time spans overlapping each other are available, we determined a mean age for the time span (e.g., mean age of 27.75\u00a0Ma for the Afar as the pre- and syn-rift age constraints are 29 and 26.5\u00a0Ma, respectively, as summarized in Supplementary Table S4). When rifting of a given period is dated by several time spans, several single dates or a combination of both with similar rating, we determined a mean age, taken as the likeliest ages of rift initiation (Supplementary Table S5; Fig. 8a).\nWe have calculated a series of weighted probability distributions (Kernel density estimations; Wessa, 2015) from the 25 ages of rift initiation, taking into account the robustness of the rifting age constraints into account (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 8a; Supplementary Table S5). The probability distributions computed with smoothing bandwidth values ranging from 0.25 to 1.75 share five main peaks of rift initiation, whose mean ages are dated at 35.5, 27.6, 17, 10.7 and 5.7\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8b; Supplementary Table S6). The oldest peak corresponds to the extension that started during the Late Eocene in TBRZ and mainly led to the development of the Lokichar basin (Morley et al., 1999b). The second peak represents the onset of rifting recorded in the late Lower Oligocene in the northern part of the EARS (in Afar and TBRZ; Boschetto et al., 1992; Morley et al., 1992; Ukstins et al., 2002; Wolfenden et al., 2005; Macgregor, 2015), which was coeval with the uplift of the Ethiopian dome (Pik et al., 2003; Gani et al., 2009). The short, slight extension in the Rukwa rift during the Upper Oligocene developed slightly after this second period of rift initiation (Roberts et al., 2012b). The third peak dated at 17\u00a0Ma is found in several provinces of the East and West branches located around of the TBRZ (i.e., the TBRZ, the South MER, and the Nyanza, North Gregory and Albertine rifts; Fig. 8a; Drake et al., 1988; McDougall and Watkins, 1988; Boschetto et al., 1992; Ebinger et al., 1993a; Behrensmeyer et al., 2002; Simon et al., 2017). The tectonic activity was mostly characterized by slight faulting and basin downwarping and was synchronous with the uplift of the Kenya dome (Wichura et al., 2010). Importantly, these three older periods of extension were restricted to one or several segments of the EARS.\nContrary to the three older peaks, the two most recent peaks correspond to periods of generalized rifting that synchronously occurred all over EARS. The first period of generalized rift initiation started at 10.7\u00a0Ma and led to the development of grabens in the southern Afar, the North and Central MER, the North Gregory and Tanganyika rifts and the Mozambique channel (Crossley, 1979; Mougenot et al., 1989; WoldeGabriel et al., 1990; Cohen et al., 1993; Ukstins et al., 2002; Wolfenden et al., 2005). Around the Miocene - Pliocene transition (~5.7\u00a0Ma), the already active grabens of the EARS underwent a significant increase of subsidence (North Gregory and Albertine rifts and Mozambique channel; Spiegel et al., 2007; Franke et al., 2015; Simon et al., 2017), rift structures were reactivated (Afar, South MER, TBRZ, Nyanza and Rukwa rifts; Pickford, 1994; Ebinger et al., 1989b, 2000; Haileab et al., 2004; Stab et al., 2016), and new grabens initiated (South Gregory and Malawi rifts and Madagascar; Foster et al., 1997; Laville et al., 1998; McCartney and Scholz, 2016).\nOur synthesis of rifting suggests the occurrence of two successive periods of rifting distinguished both from the extent of the areas synchronously affected by extension and from the magnitude and duration of extension (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nThe cause of intraplate magmatism in continental areas is often subject to debate. Two endmember models propose that it may result either from deep-seated mantle plumes rooted in the core-mantle boundary (the \u201cplume\u201d theory; Morgan, 1971), or from lithospheric deformation related to plate tectonics without any input of lower mantle material (the \u201cplate\u201d theory; Anderson, 2000, 2005; Foulger, 2010). In the latter case, magmatism would stem from shallow thermal instabilities in the upper mantle (King and Ritsema, 2000) or from the collection of already existing partial melts in a heterogeneous upper mantle (Valentine and Perry, 2007; Valentine and Hirano, 2010; Brenna et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2021). In the context of lithospheric extension, asthenospheric decompression is an additional process for mantle partial melting and magma production (Ruppel, 1995).\nIn this general theoretical framework, the volcanism of the EARS has been interpreted in different ways, partly depending on the volume of emitted magmas. Deep mantle plumes would have caused the traps and flood basalts emitted during relatively short periods (1\u20137\u00a0Myrs) coeval with plateau uplift for the two most voluminous (Ethiopian traps and Kenyan volcanics; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998; George et al., 1998; Courtillot et al., 1999; Pik et al., 2006). The discontinuous small-volume volcanic activity in the West, South-East and Indian Ocean branches is more controversial. It is thought to be either the result of plume-fed lateral asthenospheric flows (Ebinger and Sleep, 1998), independent mantle plumes (Comoros archipelago; Emerick and Duncan, 1982; Class et al., 2005; Rungwe; Burke and Dewey, 1973), related to lithospheric extension (Corti et al., 2003), or remains unexplained as in Madagascar. Alternatively, geochemical data and tomographic images suggest that the volcanism of the whole EARS could arise from several mantle anomalies rooted in the seismically imaged African Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP; Montelli et al., 2006; Furman, 2007; Halld\u00f3rsson et al., 2014; Civiero et al., 2015; French and Romanowicz, 2015; O'Connor et al., 2019; Tsekhmistrenko et al., 2021). In this hypothesis of a common source for the volcanism, the genetic link with the lithospheric extension is unclear.\nOur results suggest that the EARS experienced an overall similar timing of volcanism and rifting all over its provinces, overprinted by four short periods of intense magma emission on restricted areas (Turkana, Ethiopian plateau, Kenya and Afar; Figs. 6, 7). We saw above that such sporadic volcanism has been attributed to successive mantle plume head impingements below the African lithosphere (Hofmann et al., 1997; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998; George et al., 1998). However, as previously argued by Bailey (1992, 1993), the remarkable synchronicity of volcanism and tectonics in provinces spread over ~5000\u00a0km challenges the classical plume model, and raises fundamental questions about the relationship between lithospheric extension and mantle upwelling. Therefore, alternative interpretations suggest that the entire volcanism of the EARS results from the sole effect of successive events of plate deformation (e.g., Bailey and Woolley, 2005).\nHere, we take advantage of our compilations of volcanism and extension ages to infer the respective roles of mantle and plate dynamics in the evolution of the EARS. Our synthesis suggests the occurrence of two successive periods distinguished by the extent of the areas synchronously affected by volcanism and extension, by the magnitude and duration of both phenomena (Figs. 8b and 9\n). We propose that the EARS is characterized by an Upper Eocene to Middle Miocene period of prevailing trap-scale rifting, during which extension was almost exclusively restricted to areas of continental flood basalts. This magmato-tectonic event is followed, since the Upper Miocene, by a period of plate-scale rifting that marks the onset of a widespread deformation in the four branches of the EARS.\nWhen discussing the possible causes of both volcanism and extension and the origin of this twofold evolution, the seven following key features must be integrated to any hypothesis for rifting and magma production within the EARS.\n1- As noted by Thorpe and Smith (1974), the volcanism and deformation almost systematically developed along Pan-African orogenic belts and avoided the cratonic regions (Fig. 2a). These belts have repeatedly focused thermal events and ascending magmas since the Proterozoic leading to the fertilization of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992; Begg et al., 2009). Thus, the spatial distribution of both volcanism and tectonics suggests a main mechanical control of the lithosphere in the concentration of the deformation and in the channelization of the ascending magmas along the main inherited shear zones (e.g., Bailey, 1977; Corti et al., 2007).\n2- Magmatism did not significantly migrate in each volcanic province (Bailey, 1992) while the African lithosphere drifted northwards of about 400\u2013500\u00a0km since 25\u201327\u00a0Ma (George et al., 1998). The lack of any lateral displacement of the active volcanic centres seems in contradiction with the migration expected if each province was related to the sole effect of the mantle dynamics. It instead strengthens the role played by the lithospheric structures in the location of magma emission.\n3- Synchronous magmatic activity occurs all-over the African plate. Wooley (2001) revealed that the magmatism of the African plate experienced periods of coeval activity since the Early Cretaceous. Our compilation concentrated on a shorter timescale, spanning from the Eocene to present, leads to a similar conclusion. The volcanism started in the East branch in the Eocene with two traps events (Turkana and Ethiopian flood basalts). Yet, it extended to the entire EARS as soon as the Upper Oligocene \u2013 Lower Miocene with a discontinuous, small-volume volcanic activity (Figs. 7, 9a). Furthermore, a pulse of volcanism from 18.5 to 17\u00a0Ma occurred in almost all the volcanic provinces, synchronously with the initiation of the emission of the Kenyan volcanics. Finally, the volcanism renewed at 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma in most volcanic areas after a lull of activity between 15 and 12.5\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7). The volume of magma (relatively small but hardly quantifiable), the timing (a discontinuous volcanic activity since 25\u201327\u00a0Ma) and the lack of crustal doming are not compatible with the model of mantle plume of Morgan (1971). The onset of the volcanism between 25 and 27\u00a0Ma and its intensification at ~18.5\u00a0Ma in provinces of the EARS distant of about 5000\u00a0km can also be hardly explained by an Afar or Kenyan plume-fed, fast-moving lateral asthenospheric flow like those producing age-progressive hotspot tracks in the southern Atlantics (O'Connor et al., 2018). Moreover, the apparent synchronicity of the widespread, discontinuous, and small-volume volcanism in the different branches of the EARS casts doubt on the existence of totally independent thermal anomalies at the origin of each volcanic province. Finally, the absence of known lithospheric extension in most segments that experienced this Upper Oligocene \u2013 Middle Miocene volcanism mostly disagrees with an asthenospheric decompression due to rift-related lithospheric thinning, as in passive rifts (Ruppel, 1995).\n4- Our synthesis of the volcanic activity and the periods of rift initiation seems to indicate that the onset of volcanism predated the lithospheric deformation. During the period of predominant trap-scale rifting, the traps or major volcanic events were generally coeval with crustal doming and followed by extension spatially restricted to the vicinity of the volcanic zones (Fig. 9a). As rift initiation in the EARS was partly dated by volcanic units deposited within the grabens (providing a minimum age rated as weakly constrained), it cannot be totally excluded that its age was locally slightly underestimated. Yet, the weighting in the age probability estimates combined with the use of several smoothing bandwidths in the Kernel density estimations considerably minimizes the potential methodological biases and an uncertainty of \u00b11\u00a0Myr seems to be reasonably applied to the age of the periods of rift initiation. The volcanism\/ extension succession begins with the Turkana traps, followed by extension in the Lokichar basin only by 0.7\u00a0Myrs, a too short interval to be considered significant given our dating strategy. Then, the Ethiopian traps volcanism was followed by ~3\u00a0Myrs by extension in Afar and TBRZ (Figs. 8b and 9a; Boschetto et al., 1992; Morley et al., 1992; Ukstins et al., 2002; Wolfenden et al., 2005; Macgregor, 2015), synchronously with the onset of the Ethiopian plateau's uplift (Pik et al., 2003; Gani et al., 2009). The same succession was observed in the Middle-Late Miocene with the Kenyan volcanics (flood basalts and ignimbrites; George et al., 1998; Tatsumi and Kimura, 1991) followed by 2\u00a0Myrs by the slight faulting and basin downwarping in several provinces of the East and West branches located in the vicinity of the uplifting Kenya Dome (i.e., the TBRZ, the South MER, and the Nyanza, North Gregory and Albertine rifts; Figs. 8 and 9a; Drake et al., 1988; McDougall and Watkins, 1988; Boschetto et al., 1992; Ebinger et al., 1993a; Behrensmeyer et al., 2002; Wichura et al., 2010; Simon et al., 2017). Our compilation also shows that a main change occurred in the dynamics of the EARS between 11\u00a0Ma and 12.5\u00a0Ma, with renewed volcanism at 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma in all the volcanic provinces already affected by the volcanism, and followed, by 1.7\u00a0Myrs, by the onset of continuous and widespread rifting (Figs. 8b and 9b). Thus, volcanism seems to be systematically followed by extension in its surrounding areas. It may suggest that magmatism-related processes favour rifting in the EARS during both periods of prevailing trap-scale and plate-scale rifting.\n5- Combining radiometric ages of the volcanism and the ages of rift initiation, we show that the EARS experienced successive magmato-tectonic events at 35.5, 27.5\u201330, 17\u201319, 11\u201312.5 and 5\u20136\u00a0Ma (Fig. 8b). Noteworthily, most of these events were coeval with the main changes in the geodynamics of the plate boundaries surrounding Africa. The age of 35\u00a0Ma corresponds to the onset of rifting in the Gulf of Aden (Bellahsen et al., 2006) and to a sharp increase of the spreading rate in the South-West Indian ridge (SWIR; Fig. 10\n; DeMets et al., 2021). The opening of the Red Sea started at 27\u00a0Ma synchronously with extension around the area covered by the Ethiopian traps (Bosworth et al., 2005) and slightly before the extension in the Rukwa rift (Roberts et al., 2012b). The onset of seafloor spreading in the Gulf of Aden is dated at 17.5\u00a0Ma (Fournier et al., 2010) and the changes of spreading rates along the ridges surrounding the Nubia and Somali plates (DeMets and Merkouriev, 2019; DeMets et al., 2020, 2021) were all coeval with the initiation of magmatic periods and\/or extension in the EARS (Fig. 10). The widespread volcanic resumption and rifting at 11\u201312.5 in the EARS is contemporaneous with changes of the spreading rates in the southern Atlantic (DeMets and Merkouriev, 2019) and the Indian Ocean (Merkouriev and DeMets, 2006; Fournier et al., 2010; DeMets et al., 2020), the migration of the rotation pole of the India-Somalia and Capricorn-Somalia plate pairs (Merkouriev and DeMets, 2006; DeMets et al., 2020), and the beginning of the oceanic spreading in Red Sea (Augustin et al., 2021).\n6- Seismological images computed from regional and\/or global seismic networks have all revealed low-velocity anomalies of various size and intensity in the upper and lower mantles beneath eastern Africa (Anderson et al., 1992; King and Ritsema, 2000; Montelli et al., 2006; Montagner et al., 2007; Begg et al., 2009; Civiero et al., 2015; Tsekhmistrenko et al., 2021). These anomalies, which are superimposed to the volcanic provinces of the EARS (Fig. 9c), are in geometric connection with the LLSVP beneath southern Africa (Ritsema et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 2012; Tsekhmistrenko et al., 2021; Fig. 9d).\nIf the occurrence of low-velocity anomalies is widely accepted, their nature is highly debated (e.g., Garnero et al., 2016). On the one hand, the LLSVP below southern Africa is interpreted as a large thermal anomaly broken up into bundles of thermomechanical plumes (Davaille and Romanowicz, 2020), which promotes an ascending flow from the lower mantle (Forte et al., 2010), feeds mantle anomalies within the upper mantle (e.g., Civiero et al., 2015), and\/or triggers the development of plume-like discrete mantle anomalies on their margins (e.g., Torsvik et al., 2006; Burke et al., 2008; Tsekhmistrenko et al., 2021). On the other hand, the LLSVP is considered as a large compositional anomaly with mantle volumes richer in iron, hence denser than the rest of the mantle and not thermally buoyant (e.g., Trampert et al., 2004). An alternative interpretation suggests that the LLSVP is primarily a thermal anomaly with a basal positive density anomaly (Simmons et al., 2010). Whatever the amplitude of the dense compositional anomaly, Ishii and Tromp (1999) and Mao et al. (2006) proposed that the LLSVP could correspond to zones of concentration of dense iron-rich materials, but the iron enrichment would stem from an iron concentration beneath mantle upwellings. Thus, the possible iron-rich origin of a dense LLSVP would be compatible with ascending materials above this anomaly.\nThe low-velocity anomalies imaged in the upper mantle below the volcanic provinces of the EARS are widely considered as evidence of hot mantle volumes (e.g., Anderson et al., 1992; Montagner et al., 2007; Civiero et al., 2015). Yet, the temperature estimates of these mantle anomalies suggest thermal anomalies toward the lower end of the global temperature range for large igneous provinces, despite markedly slow seismic velocities of the mantle that underlies the regions (Rooney et al., 2012). It could therefore suggest that the low seismic velocities underneath Africa reflect the occurrence upper mantle thermal anomalies containing carbonatite (i.e., CO2-assisted) melting (Presnall and Gudfinnsson, 2005; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2006; Rooney et al., 2012).\n7- Finally, the geochemical signatures of the lavas emitted along the EARS reveal the involvement of different mantle sources in the magma production (e.g., Class et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 2000; Pik et al., 2006; Furman, 2007). These sources are proposed to originate from the African LLSVP, which is thought to compositionally heterogeneous (Furman, 2007; Meshesha and Shinjo, 2008; Halld\u00f3rsson et al., 2014). Interestingly, this interpretation based on samples restricted to the East and West branches, was confirmed by O'Connor et al. (2019) when integrating volcanic products of the four branches. Indeed, the authors identified a unique non-volatile superplume isotopic signature in the post-10\u00a0Ma magmas emitted during the plate-scale rifting.\nThe above-mentioned synthesis of the seven key features suggests that the structure and evolution of the EARS, and the dynamics of the surrounding plates and underneath mantle cannot be explained with the sole \u201cplume\u201d or sole \u201cplate\u201d theories. We therefore interpret the EARS as the result of the combined effects of (1) extensive stresses acting on the African lithosphere in the long-lived context of the Gondwana breakup and (2) an overall complex dynamics of mantle upwelling.\nThe extensive stresses could arise from far-field stresses, variations of GPE, and\/or divergent shear traction exerted at the base of the Nubia and Somali lithospheres (e.g., Forte et al., 2010; Ghosh and Holt, 2012; Stamps et al., 2015). According to Stamps et al. (2015), the current kinematics of the EARS results from the combined effects of GPE variations and Couette-type divergent mantle flow. Yet, it is worth noting that extension stresses due to GPE variations cannot be invoked for rifting periods prior to any uplift event like for the Turkana extension at around 35\u00a0Ma.\nIt is also important to mention that the mantle upwellings beneath Africa clearly differ from the narrow plumes of Morgan's theory (1971). The mantle dynamics could instead correspond to a global upward and north-easterly tilted mantle flow (Forte et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2012; Fig. 9d) made of bundles of compositional and\/or thermal anomalies of different size and magnitude originating from the African LLSVP (Davaille and Romanowicz, 2020).\nIn such a general context, we propose that the LLSVP may have spewed thermal and\/or compositional anomalies of various sizes, intensities, and compositions in an upper mantle becoming hotter than normal. We speculate that their surface expression (i.e., volcanism) was partly modulated by extension stresses arising from the plate circuit and\/or basal lithospheric drag due to divergent mantle flows as suggested by the synchronicity between, on the one hand, the tectono-magmatic events of the EARS at 35.5, 17\u201319, 11\u201312.5\u00a0Ma, and, on the other hand, changes in the dynamics along the Nubia and Somali plates boundaries (Fig. 10).\nThe following gradation of mantle anomalies vs. extension stresses can be proposed to explain the evolution of the EARS. The first endmember corresponds to a main role played by the mantle anomalies in the development of the volcanic event. This case is well illustrated by the Ethiopian traps that were followed by extension in the adjacent segments, including the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea (Courtillot et al., 1999; Bosworth et al., 2005). The lack of any evolution of the spreading rates in the oceanic ridges at that time around the Somali and Nubia plates (Fig. 10) suggests that the development of the Ethiopian traps followed by rifting does not result from the increase of plate-scale extension stresses, but instead from a dynamic mantle anomaly.\nThe second endmember is characterized by a dominant role of the plate deformation in the location and timing of the volcanism. Following Presnall and Gudfinnsson (2005) and Rooney et al. (2012) who suggested that the slow seismic velocities could evidence the occurrence of carbonatite melts in the upper mantle, we propose that the ascent of carbonatite melts from the lower mantle to the upper mantle beneath Africa has produced widespread carbonated silicate melts at shallow depth having compositions similar to the alkaline magmas emitted in the volcanic provinces of the EARS (Kampunzu and Mohr, 1991; Rudnick et al., 1993; Coltorti et al., 1999; Dasgupta et al., 2007; Furman, 2007; Mazzeo et al., 2021). Moreover, the widespread distribution of easily fusible lithospheric metasomes within the continental lithosphere mantle might have facilitated magma generation without the need for substantial lithospheric thinning or elevated mantle potential temperatures (Rooney et al., 2014). Thus, a deformation-driven collection of already existing partial melts in a heterogenous mantle, as described by Valentine and Perry (2007), Spera and Fowler (2009)\nValentine and Hirano (2010), Smith et al. (2021), could have produced a tectonically controlled magmatism. We therefore interpret the timing of the alkaline volcanism along the Pan-African mobile belts, synchronously with main changes in the spreading ridge dynamics, as primarily controlled by the increase of extension stresses. To this respect, the Late Oligocene extension in the Rukwa rift (Fig. 8), coeval with a small alkaline to carbonatitic volcanic activity (E.M. Roberts et al., 2012b), would stem from a period of increasing extension stresses in the African lithosphere.\nThe occurrence of (1) the Turkana traps at around 35\u00a0Ma (without any lithospheric doming) and (2) the Kenyan volcanics and a widespread volcanic renewal initiated around 19\u00a0Ma (Fig. 7), while the spreading ridges recorded modifications in the extension rates (Fig. 10), might be explained by the massive melting of fertile mantle heterogeneities triggered by lithospheric deformation.\nOur synthesis can hardly determine whether the extension stresses primarily stem from far field stresses or divergent mantle flow. However, considering the main Middle Miocene change in the EARS evolution, i.e., from a prevailing trap-scale to a plate-scale rifting, we speculate that an increase of large-scale ascending mantle flow in the general framework of mantle convection during the Middle Miocene may have (1) augmented the mantle melting below all the volcanic provinces, (2) induced the Middle Miocene - Pliocene uplift of the Central African Plateau and Madagascar (de Wit, 2003; Ritsema et al., 2010; G.G. Roberts et al., 2012a; Daly et al., 2020), (3) triggered the subsequent resumption of volcanism at 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma, (4) enhanced pre-existing extensional stresses within the lithosphere by a stronger basal lithospheric drag due to a divergent Couette-type mantle flow within the sub-African asthenosphere combined to GPE variations (Stamps et al., 2015), and eventually (5) produced enough magmatism to reduce the strength of the continental lithosphere and promote magma-assisted rifting since ~11\u00a0Ma. This geodynamic change could have been important enough to modify the dynamics of the surrounding spreading ridges. Furthermore, the plate-motion change of the Capricorn plate, attributed to an increasing buoyancy of the R\u00e9union plume flux at 11\u00a0Ma (Iaffaldano et al., 2018), could instead result from the main change of the dynamics of the EARS in tandem with the possible increase of the sub-lithospheric mantle flux. The magmatic pulse recently evidenced along the Sheba ridge at 11\u00a0Ma (Gillard et al., 2021) could also have an origin closely linked to the evolution of the EARS. We finally suggest that the source of extension stresses affecting the African plate progressively evolved from a dominant far-field origin to prevailing GPE variations and a diverging Couette-type basal shear, thus changing of the dynamics of the EARS from trap-scale to plate scale rifting. In such a context of ascending mantle flux and increasing extension, the areas with a significant lithospheric thinning likely met extremely favourable conditions to produce large magma volumes like in Afar since 5\u00a0Ma (Bastow and Keir, 2011; Armitage et al., 2015).\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nOur study on the magmato-tectonic relationship of the EARS allowed us to update its geometry, by including the Mozambique channel and Madagascar in the rift system. The EARS is thus composed of one magma-rich segment, the East branch, and three magma-poor segments, the West, South-East, and Indian Ocean branches, which all delimit independent lithospheric blocks. We have built a comprehensive database of volcanic ages made from a thorough selection of the published isotopic ages of volcanism emitted along the four branches since the Middle Eocene. This compilation reveals an overall similar timing of relative quiescence (12.5\u201315\u00a0Ma) and renewals (17\u201318.5 and 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma) of activity in the different volcanic provinces, overprinted by four short (1\u20137\u00a0Ma) periods of intense magma emission on 500\u20131000\u00a0km-wide areas (Turkana, Ethiopian plateau, Kenya and Afar). We also compiled the periods of rift initiation published in the literature and evaluated the geological constrains to date them. This critical review provides insights on the timing of extension at the EARS\u2019 scale and suggests the occurrence of five successive periods of extension since the Upper Eocene. Combining the spatio-temporal distribution of both volcanism and rifting, we show that the African plate dismantling results from the intricate relationship between mantle and plate processes during two successive periods called trap-scale and plate-scale rifting between the Upper Eocene - Middle Miocene and Upper Miocene \u2013 Holocene, respectively (Figs. 8 and 9).\nWe summarize seven key features suggesting that the EARS\u2019 evolution cannot be explained by the sole plume or sole plate theories as defined by Anderson (2005). From these seven features, we propose an intermediate interpretation in which the EARS results from the intricate relationship between the mantle and plate dynamics. We consider the African LLSVP as a thermo-compositional deep anomaly that feeds mantle anomalies of different composition, size and magnitude in an overall ascending and north-easterly tilted mantle flow. This mantle dynamics likely brought favourable conditions to promote the widespread production of carbonated silicate melts emitted as alkaline magmas along the four branches of the EARS and massive volumes of tholeiitic melts feeding the trap events. The synchronicity between most of the magmato-tectonic events in the EARS and changes in the dynamics of the Nubia and Somali plates boundaries suggests that extension stresses affecting the African lithosphere partly modulated the melting of the mantle anomaly and\/or the collection of magma through the Pan-African belts. The sole exception corresponds to the Ethiopian trap event and the subsequent rifting in the surrounding areas that was not coeval with modifications in the dynamics of the plate boundaries.\nFinally, the source of extension stresses affecting the African plate probably evolved from a dominant far-field origin to prevailing GPE variations and a diverging Couette-type basal shear. We propose that this change results from the increase of the mantle flux in the Middle Miocene, yielding an evolution of the dynamics of the EARS from trap-scale to plate scale rifting.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\n\n\nFig. S1: a Spatial and temporal distributions of the magmatic provinces of the East, West, South-East and Indian Ocean from the filtered (a; Supplementary Table S3) and not filtered (b; Supplementary Table S1) radiometric age database. Error bars on isotopic ages are 2\u03c3. In b, the Afar - Ethiopian plateau, Kivu \u2013 N Tanganyika, Rungwe, Comoros \u2013 N Madagascar, Central \u2013 S Madagascar volcanic provinces and the SE branch share a discontinuous volcanic activity, a period of coeval volcanism in almost all the provinces between 17 and 18.5\u00a0Ma (grey bar) and a hiatus between 12.5 and 15\u00a0Ma (hatched zone). The pink line marks the coeval renewal of magmatism at 12\u201312.5\u00a0Ma in the East, South-East and Indian Ocean branches after the lull of activity. In the southern East branch, the Turkana Broadly Rifted Zone \u2013 N Kenya rift and the Gregory - Nyanza rift provinces both recorded the main volcanic phase of the Kenyan volcanics, and short but representative hiatuses between 7.4 and 9.1\u00a0Ma (narrow hatched zone).\n\nFig. S2: Probability distributions of periods of rift initiation in the EARS. Kernel density estimations (KDE) were performed with smoothing bandwidths ranging from 0.25 to 1.75\u00a0Ma (a to g) to assess the effect of this parameter on the age of the peaks of rift initiation. KDE were computed using a free online software (Wessa, 2015). See Supplementary Table S6 for the age of the peaks with the different smoothing bandwidths. Six main peaks (MP1 to MP6) are defined on the probability curve with a smoothing bandwidth of 0.25\u00a0Ma. Several secondary peaks are associated with MP1, MP2, and MP3 for low values of the smoothing bandwidth.\n\nImage 1\n\n\n\n\n\nTable S1\n\nRadiometric ages of the tertiary volcanism of the East African Rift System published since 1980.

These ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental changes such as natural climatic shifts or sea-level variations, and to human pressure, especially deforestation and habitat loss, invasion by alien species, coastal erosion, global warming, sea-level rise, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and extreme weather conditions (Gilman et al., 2008; Spalding et al., 2014; Biswas and Biswas, 2019; Wang and Gu, 2021). Currently, mangroves are among the world's most threatened ecosystems (Worthington et al., 2020). Therefore, studies of mangroves, their current anthropogenic threats and their responses to past environmental shifts are relevant not only for the conservation of these important and fragile wetland ecosystems but also for the maintenance of keystone land-sea ecological interactions and biogeochemical cycles. Eventual restoration practices may also benefit from the study of mangrove ecosystems and their past trends under natural and human pressure (Saenger, 2002; Bosire et al., 2008). Predictive models of the potential future trends of mangrove ecosystems also need information on the past to increase their reliability (Berger et al., 2008).\nCurrently, mangrove ecosystems are restricted to tropical and subtropical coasts between about 25\u00b0 N and 25\u00b0 S, with local variations depending on local climates and the influence of marine currents (Fig. 1\n), and occupy a total of almost 138,000\u00a0km2 (Bunting et al., 2018). Mangroves are intertidal forested ecosystems, usually dominated by one or few species of mangrove trees, with special adaptations to saline\/brackish water conditions and soft and usually anoxic sediments. The architecture of mangrove forests is determined by the aerial and submerged parts of a few characteristic tree species, known as mangrove-forming trees, which shape a multitude of habitats and ecological niches that are occupied by a high diversity of terrestrial and marine organisms (Chapman, 1976; Tomlinson, 2016). The ecosystem is fully organized, both structurally and functionally, around these mangrove-tree species, without which these ecosystems would not exist. The mangrove fringe greatly influences adjacent terrestrial and marine environments by contributing to the maintenance of high biodiversity and by enhancing ecological complexity in the terrestrial-marine ecotone (Lugo and Snedaker, 1974; Saenger, 2002; Nagelkerken et al., 2008). In addition, mangrove forests are well known for providing unique nursery habitats for many marine species. The juvenile stages of these species thrive inside the complex structure that forms the aerial roots of mangrove trees, where survival is favored by maximizing food availability and minimizing predation incidence (Laegdsgaard and Johnson, 2001).\nMangrove-tree species have a globally heterogeneous biogeographical pattern, as manifested in the conspicuous asymmetrical distribution of species richness, with maxima in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) region and minima in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Eastern Pacific (ACEP or AEP) area (Fig. 2\n). This \u201canomalous\u201d pattern has been explained using either dispersalist or vicarianist hypotheses. Dispersalists propose that mangroves originated in the IWP and then dispersed to the ACEP (Van Steenis, 1962). Vicarianists contend that mangrove taxa evolved during the Late Cretaceous around the continuous Tethys Sea (Fig. 3\n) and diversified later, when this sea was closed by the African barrier, thus isolating the IWP and ACEP areas (McCoy and Heck, 1976). Using macrofossil (leaves, wood, flowers, fruits) and microfossil (pollen) records of mangrove trees, along with fossils of mollusks characteristic of the mangrove ecosystem, Ellison et al. (1999) supported the vicariance hypothesis and suggested that mangrove ecosystems originated at the Paleocene\/Eocene boundary around the Tethys Sea. These authors also suggested three independent regions of diversification: the Caribbean-Eastern Pacific region, the Indian Ocean region and the South-East Asian region.\nThe vicariance hypothesis has become the most widely accepted but the times of origin of pantropical mangrove communities and their split into the ACEP and IWP regions vary depending on the authors. For example, Plaziat et al. (2001) believed that mangroves originated during the Paleocene and the biogeographical split occurred at the Eocene\/Oligocene (E\/O) boundary. Duke (2017) proposed a Late Cretaceous origin followed by a E\/O split and a further Late Miocene differentiation within the ACEP and IWP areas. Srivastava and Prasad (2018) also situated the mangrove origins in the Late Cretaceous and the east-west split at the E\/O boundary. According to these authors, mangrove communities would have survived the Cretaceous\/Paleocene (K\/T) mass extinction in tropical areas near the Equator (Sowunmi, 1986; Srivastava and Prasad, 2015). Detailed accounts of potential dispersal pathways and barriers for mangroves since the Cretaceous are provided by Dodd and Rafii (2002), Duke et al. (2002), Triest (2008), Duke (2017) and Van der Stocken et al. (2019), on the basis of molecular genetic evidence, oceanic paleocurrent simulations and global climate changes.\nThe phylogeographic trends of Rhizophora, the only mangrove-forming genus with a presently pantropical distribution, have been used as a model for the split and diversification of mangroves, in general. For example, Lo et al. (2018), using a combination of nuclear and chloroplastic DNA, supported the occurrence of dispersal across the Tethys Sea, a subsequent. Eocene split between the AEP and IWP lineages and further diversification within each biogeographic region during the Oligo-Miocene. Other studies estimated younger ages for the AEP-IWP separation. For example, a recent phylogeographic study using chloroplastic DNA suggested that the divergence between the AEP and IWP lineages of Rhizophora occurred during the Middle Miocene and was likely influenced by the total Oligo-Miocene closure of the Tethys seaway and a Miocene global cooling (Takayama et al., 2021). The use of molecular DNA-based phylogeography has contributed to clarifying the significance of dispersal and vicariance processes in mangrove evolution; however, the chronology of events still needs further work, especially in regard to phylogenetic calibration. Special care should be taken to avoid circularity by calibrating the phylogenetic trees with known geological events and then trying to evaluate the influence of these events on mangrove evolution.\nIn the Caribbean area, which is the main target of this study, fossil pollen evidence suggested that the Neotropical mangrove flora gradually differentiated from the Tethyan pantropical flora during the Paleocene\/Eocene (P\/E) transition (Rull, 1999, 2000), probably under the influence of Early-Eocene global warming (Zachos et al., 1994, 2001). According to Jaramillo (2002), this was likely a regional phenomenon in northern South America, which is consistent with the definition of a separate Eocene floral province, called \u201cNeotropical\u201d, for this tropical region (Romero, 1993). This would agree with an origin of the ACEP diversification area around the P\/E boundary. The earliest fossil records of Neotropical mangrove taxa correspond to the Late Cretaceous (Srivastava and Prasad, 2018), which would be consistent with the occurrence of a pantropical mangrove distribution by those times.\nThe Neotropical mangroves underwent thorough evolutionary turnover in the E\/O boundary, characterized by regional extinction of the Eocene taxa and the first evolutionary appearances of the modern mangrove-tree genera, likely linked to the global cooling that initiated the current icehouse-Earth state, characterized by the development of Antarctic ice caps (Rull, 1998b). It is generally accepted that this global cooling was linked to continental drift, especially to the separation of Australia from Antarctica, in the Eastern Hemisphere, and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Western Hemisphere. This new continental configuration produced a major shift in oceanic currents from the former Tethyan circulation mostly restricted to the tropical region to a trans-latitudinal current regime characterized by the arrival of polar currents to tropical latitudes (Zachos et al., 1996; Prothero, 2005; Lyle et al., 2008). Under these conditions, the Neotropical Eocene mangrove taxa, adapted to warm tropical climates, would have gone extinct and been replaced by a different, less diverse mangrove flora, an event known as the E\/O crisis (Rull, 1998b). This also coincided with a regional biodiversity decline in the Neotropics (Jaramillo et al., 2006), as part of a global climatically-driven E\/O extinction event (Prothero and Bergreen, 1992; Ivany et al., 2000). Since then, Neotropical mangroves have experienced a sustained floral diversification trend with no evidence of regional extinctions during the Neogene (Graham, 1995).\nA critical point in the study of the origin and evolution of mangroves is the type of fossil evidence needed to reliably infer the occurrence of past mangrove ecosystems. The most common procedure is the inference from botanical affinities between fossils and extant mangrove taxa, usually at the genus level (e.g., Muller, 1981; Frederiksen, 1985). However, assuming that the botanical affinity is correct, a straightforward relationship between individual taxonomic and ecologic features is not guaranteed. Therefore, inferences about past mangrove ecosystems based on individual qualitative presence\/absence data are unwarranted (Plaziat et al., 2001). A more robust approach is the use of fossil plant and animal assemblages characteristic of mangrove communities as proxies for these ecosystems. Ideally, this assemblage approach should be quantitative, that is, based on the relative abundances of the different components of mangrove ecosystems. However, this is usually difficult to address due to the different nature of fossils from different taxa and their disparate preservation conditions.\nAnother possibility is to use fossil pollen and spores to reconstruct past plant communities and compare their taxonomic composition, the relative abundances of its components and their arrangement along the sea-land salinity gradient with those of present-day mangrove ecosystems (e.g., Muller, 1959; Rull, 1998a; Hofmann, 2002; Willard et al., 2001; Urrego et al., 2010; Polan\u00eda et al., 2015). This is known as the modern-analog approach. As mentioned above, mangrove trees are essential for the existence of these communities and it is assumed that finding fossil assemblages of mangrove-tree and other mangrove-associate taxa in significant abundance is a reliable indicator of the past occurrence of mangrove plant communities. This paleobotanical evidence should be found in sediments of coastal origin, represented by rock formations characteristic of deltaic, shallow marine and other land-sea transitional environments. Quantitative pollen analysis is a common method in Quaternary paleoecology (Faegri et al., 1989; Moore et al., 1991) and has fostered substantial advances in the reconstruction of past ecological, biogeographical and environmental dynamics (Birks and Birks, 1981; Rull, 2020). Mangrove ecosystems have not been an exception (e.g., Woodroffe and Grindrod, 1991; Ellison, 2008). However, this community approach has not yet not been well developed for the reconstruction of Meso-Cenozoic mangrove ecosystems.\nThis paper reviews the available pollen-based quantitative reconstructions of the southern Caribbean region, which is considered the cradle of Neotropical mangroves (Graham, 1995; Srivastava and Prasad, 2018), aimed at identifying the oldest mangrove assemblages recorded by the community approach and discussing the possible implications of these findings for the evolutionary trends and biogeographical patterns of Neotropical mangrove communities. The first part briefly describes extant Neotropical mangroves and the fossil pollen\/spore species commonly utilized to record these communities in Late Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rocks. The second part reviews in detail the published Late Cretaceous to Eocene quantitative palynological records (prior to the evolutionary emergence of modern-like mangrove ecosystems) containing potential evidence for the occurrence of precursor mangrove communities and their qualitative (taxonomic) and quantitative (relative abundances) compositions. Then, the full body of evidence is analyzed to identify the oldest mangrove communities found and their main features. The new findings obtained in this analysis are discussed to highlight their potential evolutionary and biogeographical significance, under a global pantropical perspective. Finally, some general ideas for future studies on mangrove origins and evolution are suggested.\n\n\n2\nModern Caribbean mangroves\nCurrently, Caribbean mangroves are dominated by seven species of mangrove-forming trees corresponding to five genera and four families: Rhizophora mangle L., R. harrisonii Leechm., R. racemosa G. Mey (Rhizophoraceae), Pelliciera rhizophorae Planchon & Triana (Tetrameristaceae), Avicennia germinans L. (Acanthaceae), Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. and Conocarpus erectus L. (Combretaceae). The pollen of these species is easy to distinguish at the genus level (Bertrand, 1983). These species grow in the intertidal zone of lower coastal plain environments and form different community combinations depending on local climatic, topographic, edaphic, flooding and salinity conditions. The different salinity tolerances of these species yield a characteristic sea-land zonal pattern in the mangrove fringe (Fig. 4\n). The fern Acrostichum aureum L. (Pteridaceae) is also very common in back-mangrove swamps of the upper coastal plain, which are flooded by brackish waters during spring tides. The most important elements of the Caribbean mangroves and their respective pollen\/spore types are illustrated in Figs. 5 to 7\n\n\n.\nMore detailed information on the taxonomic composition and ecology of Caribbean mangroves, back-mangrove swamps, freshwater wetlands, rainforests and savannas from the alluvial plain can be found elsewhere (e.g., Chapman, 1976; Thanikaimoni, 1987; Tomlinson, 2016), but the species mentioned here are enough for the purpose of the present paper, which is focused on mangrove-tree species as community builders. The accepted fossil representatives of the mentioned extant mangrove species are shown in Table 1\n and their respective stratigraphic ranges are displayed in Fig. 8\n. Notably, A. germinans, L. racemosa and C. erectus lack the corresponding fossil morphotypes and are identified in Mio-Pliocene sediments using their respective extant genera, namely, Avicennia, Laguncularia and Conocarpus (Graham, 1995). The straightforward use of generic names for the other mangrove taxa (Rhizophora, Acrostichum, Pelliciera) is also common in Cenozoic studies, but taxonomic identifications are always based on the corresponding fossil morphotypes.\nThe extant mangrove species of the Caribbean have different biogeographical distributions. Rhizophora mangle and Acrostichum aureum are pantropical. Rhizophora racemosa and R. harrisonii occur at both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, on the tropical coasts of Africa and America. Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Conocarpus erectus have a similar distribution, with the addition of the Pacific tropical American coasts. The most restricted species is Pelliciera rhizophoraceae, which is endemic to a small area around the Panama Isthmus (Muller and Caratini, 1977; Tomlinson, 2016; Duke, 2017). However, the fossil representative of this species, Lanagiopollis crassa (van der Hammen & Wijmstra) Frederiksen (=Psilatricolporites crassus van der Hammen & Wijmstra) (Table 1), was present across the whole Neotropical region during the Eocene and was progressively restricted to its present area around the Panama Isthmus (Fig. 9\n) (Wijmstra, 1968; Fuchs, 1970; Winograd, 1983). It has been proposed that this significant biogeographical reduction was linked to the low tolerance of this species to high-salinity conditions (Jim\u00e9nez, 1984). However, Dangremond et al. (2015) observed that extant Pelliciera species can tolerate high salinities.\nAnother special case is the palm Nypa fruticans Wurmb., which is exclusive to the IWP mangroves but its fossil representatives (Spinizonocolpites echinatus Muller, S. prominatus (McIntyre) Stover & Evans, and possibly S. baculatus Muller) were present in the Caribbean mangroves from the Late Cretaceous until the E\/O boundary (Fig. 8) (Gee, 2001). Lim et al. (2022) extended its chronostratigraphic range until the Early Miocene (Aquitanian). At present, N. fruticans occurs mostly on the inner side of the Indo-Malayan mangrove fringe, in brackish-water environments (Flenley, 1979; Bunt et al., 1982; Tomlinson, 2016), and it has been assumed that its fossil representatives grew under similar conditions. According to Lim et al. (2022), the reasons for the drastic geographical range reduction are still unclear, and modern N. fruticans is able to live in mangroves outside the IWP region. Indeed, the species has been reintroduced by humans in the ACEP region (Duke, 2017), where it has been demonstrated to be an aggressive colonizer of coastal environments under human pressure. For example, N. fruticans was introduced over a century ago to the western African coasts (Niger Delta) to minimize coastal erosion and is now a major threat to native Rhizophora mangroves, which are receding due to anthropogenic disturbances such as oil exploration and urbanization. There, Nypa populations have been able to invade a variety of human-disturbed environments, from the outermost coastal fringe to the inner delta river channels (Numbere, 2019).\nFinally, some fossil morphotypes with no known extant relatives have been considered by some authors as indicators of mangrove communities. For example, Brevitricolpites variabilis Gonz\u00e1lez Guzm\u00e1n has only been reported in the Eocene (Fig. 8) and has been considered a potential mangrove species (Gonz\u00e1lez Guzm\u00e1n, 1967; Graham, 1995) on the basis of its abundance and distribution patterns, which were similar to those of Rhizophora in Quaternary sediments (Van der Hammen, 1963). Other authors, however, do not support this idea (Frederiksen, 1985; Thanikaimoni, 1987). According to Jaramillo and Dilcher (2001), the definition of the genus Brevitricolpites is very loose and needs further taxonomic studies. Other examples of fossil morphotypes with possible mangrove affinity are Proxapertites operculatus van der Hammen and Echitriporites trianguliformis van Hoeken-Klinkenberg. The first is similar to some palm pollen types growing in both coastal and inner continental environments (Lorente, 1986) and the second is similar to the pollen of some Proteaceae (Germeraad et al., 1968). Therefore, the evidence for considering these species mangrove components is insufficient (Thanikaimoni, 1987). Paleoecological studies suggest that P. operculatus and E. trianguliformis were instead elements from inland environments (Rull, 1998c).\nConsidering the above mangrove-tree taxa and other associated elements, Graham (1995) identified a total of 27 plant genera whose pollen was characteristic of Neotropical mangroves during the Cenozoic. On the basis of presence\/absence data, this author reported a net diversification trend, with only 2 extinctions (Brevitricolpites and Nypa), from the Early\/Middle Eocene to the present (Table 2\n).\n\n\n3\nQuantitative fossil pollen records\nBased on presence\/absence data, the oldest mangrove elements from the Caribbean region were found on the present-day southern coasts of this region, in the area currently occupied by northern Colombia and western Venezuela (Fig. 10\n). The evidence consisted of Nypa pollen (Spinizonocolpites echinatus\/S. prominatus\/S. baculatus) found in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) rocks from the numerous oil wells drilled in the region (Germeraad et al., 1968). Qualitative mangrove evidence from other Caribbean areas did not appear until the Eocene (Frederiksen, 1985; Graham, 1995; Gee, 2001). The next sections analyze the available quantitative records of mangrove communities in the region from the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene. Many of these records are from surveys developed for natural resource exploration and exploitation purposes, for which palynology has been a paramount stratigraphic tool in rocks deposited in continental and coastal settings (Rull, 2002; Jaramillo et al., 2005). The results are presented first in relation to their original interpretations and are discussed separately in a further section. The tectonic evolution of the Caribbean plate from the Late Cretaceous to the present is provided in Fig. 11\n for reference.\n\n3.1\nLate Cretaceous\nThe first records of Caribbean Spinizonocolpites were published as qualitative or semiquantitative records, because the main aim of these studies was to develop a classical palynostratigraphic framework for the region (Kuyl et al., 1955; Germeraad et al., 1968). However, the detailed pollen counts are available in the confidential records of the corresponding oil companies and it would be very interesting to apply modern plotting and statistical techniques to these datasets if they become available in the future. From the published semiquantitative data (i.e., abundance classes expressed as probabilities of reobservation), the Spinizonocolpites group was in the maximum category (p 0.95\u20131.00), in the Campanian\/Maastrichtian formations Col\u00f3n and Mito Juan, from a Venezuelan surface section called Rubio Road (Figs. 10, 12 and 13\n\n) (Germeraad et al., 1968). Unfortunately, it is not possible to deduce the relative abundance of palynomorphs from these representations. Although the authors did not perform any paleoenvironmental inferences, it is known that the Col\u00f3n Formation (hereafter Fm) was deposited in a shallow marine environment, whereas the Mito Juan Fm was deposited under deltaic conditions (Fig. 12) (Montilla et al., 2013). This is compatible with the high abundance of Nypa pollen, which probably originated in coastal environments dominated by this palm. Other possible mangrove elements \u2013 notably Acrostichum (Deltoidospora adriennis), which was already present in the Caribbean region during the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 8) \u2013 were not reported by Germeraad et al. (1968), but it is not known whether this is due to the actual absence of this fern spore or to deliberate omission due its low stratigraphic value.\nA truly quantitative palynological analysis is available for the Late Maastrichtian in the northern Andean section of R\u00edo Lora (Figs. 10 and 12). The base of the section is characterized by the Late Maastrichtian Mito Juan Fm, which was deposited in marginal marine environments (Pocknall and Erlich, 2020). Two main parts can be distinguished within this formation on the basis of palynomorph content. The lower part is dominated by angiosperm pollen, while dinoflagellates show medium abundances, suggesting more coastal environments (Fig. 14\n). The upper part is characterized by maximal values of dinoflagellates and minimal abundances of angiosperms, which indicates more marine conditions, possibly shallow marine environments. Spinizonocolpites was more abundant in the lower section and decreased to lower values in the more marine part. No other mangrove elements were recorded in the Mito Juan Fm of the R\u00edo Lora section.\nAnother quantitative palynological study was developed in the Campanian\/Maastrichtian Umir Fm, which is considered to be the equivalent of the Col\u00f3n-Mito Juan formations (Due\u00f1as, 1989; Villamil, 1999). The Umir Fm outcrops in the San Luis area (Figs. 10 and 12) of the Middle Magdalena Basin, where a series of cores were drilled for coal exploration. A composite section of these cores, encompassing the Middle and Upper Umir Fm, of Late Maastrichtian age (Tchegliakova, 1995), was analyzed for pollen, spores and other palynomorphs such as dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs and foraminiferal linings (Santos, 2012). The palynomorphs were grouped into five main groups, namely, spores, palms, Spinizonocolpites, marine palynomorphs and other angiosperms. The most abundant groups were fern spores and palms, which were considered to have been transported by rivers from inland environments. The Spinizonocolpites group was dominated by S. baculatus, and its abundance was lower (Fig. 15\n). The marine group (dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, foraminiferal linigs) showed similar abundances throughout the section, except in the uppermost part, where it experienced a conspicuous increase. The author concluded that the Middle Umir Fm was deposited in a lagoonal environment, with coastal swamps and estuarine conditions, whereas the Upper Umir Fm was deposited in a semirestricted bay close to the coastline, with strong river influx (Santos, 2012). There is no clear reference to the occurrence or absence of mangrove ecosystems. As in the case of Rubio Road discussed above, no mention is made of Deltoidospora adriennis or its extant representative, Acrostichum.\nFurther analysis of the Umir Fm based on coal cores from the Colombian area of Simacota (Fig. 10) confirmed a Campanian-Maastrichtian age and a coastal sedimentary environment. A quantitative palynological analysis similar to that of Santos (2012) was carried out with the definition of a mangrove group formed by the assemblage of the Spinizonocolpites species, a marine group constituted by dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs, foraminiferal linings and scolecodonts, and a freshwater group with Azolla and Pediastrum (Monta\u00f1o et al., 2016). These authors concluded that the Umir Fm was deposited in coastal swamps with a transition to more continental environments toward the upper part. Notably, the Spinizonocolpites group is explicitly considered to represent mangrove communities. Unfortunately, no pollen diagrams were provided for comparison. In the Upper Magdalena Valley, the Campanian\/Maastrichtian Buscavidas Fm was studied palynologically in a surface section called Buitrera (Fig. 10). The Spinizonocolpites group and Deltoidospora adriennis were absent, except for the occurrence of Spinizonocolpites baculatus in the uppermost sample (Garz\u00f3n et al., 2012). According to these authors, the absence of peridinioid cysts and the increase in estuarine (ceratioid and gymnodinoid cysts) and terrestrial (pollen and spores) palynomorphs suggested that the top of the Buscavidas section represented a progressive shallowing, which is consistent with the general paleoenvironmental trends in the study area (Fig. 12). No mention was made of the occurrence of mangrove communities.\n\n\n3.2\nPaleocene\nTwo of the sections analyzed above, Rubio Road and R\u00edo Lora, also have Paleocene sediments represented by the Barco, Catatumbo and Los Cuervos formations, which form the Orocu\u00e9 Group (Figs. 12 and 13). The Barco and Catatumbo formations were deposited in shallow marine environments near the coastline, whereas the overlying Los Cuervos Fm was deposited in a floodplain to upper shoreface environment (Pocknall and Erlich, 2020). In the Rubio Road section, the Spinizonocolpites group occurred in the Catatumbo Fm as the only mangrove-related taxon, with abundances similar to those in the Late Cretaceous section (Fig. 13). In the Los Cuervos Fm, the assemblage was dominated by non-mangrove taxa such as the Proxapertites group, Retidiporites magdalenensis and Bombacacidites annae, whereas Spinizonocolpites was no longer present (Germeraad et al., 1968). In the Paleocene part of the R\u00edo Lora section, Spinizonocolpites attained its maximum values at the transition from the Barco\/Catatumbo to the Los Cuervos formations, that is, in the transition from shallow marine to more coastal environments (Fig. 11). A few scattered occurrences of Spinizonocolpites were also reported in two other Venezuelan sections, R\u00edo Lobaterita and R\u00edo Chama (Figs. 10 and 12), where dinoflagellate cysts were also scarce, and the Los Cuervos Fm was characterized by more continental facies (Pocknall and Erlich, 2020).\nThe Riecito Mach\u00e9 sequence (Figs. 10 and 12) is composed of Paleocene to Middle Eocene sediments. The Paleocene part corresponds to the Guasare and Marcelina formations, which lie on Late Cretaceous sediments. The coal-rich Guasare Fm was deposited in limno-telmatic environments (freshwater swamps and peat bogs) under fluctuating oxygen conditions, and it is assumed that inland angiosperms were the major peat contributors (Escobar et al., 2016). The Marcelina Fm is considered to be the lateral equivalent of the Los Cuervos Fm (Pocknall and Erlich, 2020) and was deposited in a swampy environment formed by a progradational deltaic sequence on the shelf margin of the Guasare Fm (Gonz\u00e1lez de Juana et al., 1980). The results of a quantitative palynological study based on statistically significant counts (Rull, 1987) led to the definition of three main associations by cluster analysis (Rull, 1999). The first assemblage was composed of Proxapertites operculatus and Retidiporites magdalenensis and was considered to be of undefined continental origin. The second assemblage contained Ctenolophonidites lisamae, Echitriporites trianguliformis and two species of Proxapertites and is consistent with forested environments flooded by freshwater. The third assemblage was characterized by Deltoidospora adriennis (the fossil representative of the back-mangrove fern Acrostichum) and Mauritiidites franciscoi, related to the living palm Mauritia, which is salinity-intolerant (Rull, 1998d; Rull and Montoya, 2014). This assemblage was interpreted as representative of the transition between alluvial plains and coastal plains with no tidal influence. The stratigraphic distribution of these assemblages showed a progressive trend from freshwater to coastal swamps (Fig. 16\n). Interestingly, Spinizonocolpites (Nypa) was absent, and Deltoidospora adriennis (Acrostichum) was the only representative of modern Caribbean mangroves, which could be due to the dominance of inland freshwater environments unsuitable for Nypa. The occurrence of Spinizonocolpites in Paleocene rocks deposited in coastal and shallow marine sediments of the Rubio Road and R\u00edo Lora sediments (Figs. 13 and 14) is consistent with this interpretation.\nIn Colombia, the Paleocene coastal plains were dominated by the same non-mangrove taxa as the Los Cuervos Fm of the Venezuelan Rubio Road section, i.e., Proxapertites spp., Retidiporites magdalenensis and Bombacacidites annae (Jaramillo, 2002). The best example is the Pi\u00f1alerita section (Figs. 10 and 12), where the Paleocene coastal plains are represented by El Limbo clays. Spinizonocolpites (Nypa) was present only in scattered samples and Deltoidospora (Acrostichum) was absent. No pollen diagrams are available, but statistically reliable raw pollen counts can be found in Jaramillo and Dilcher (2001). The Paleocene was also present in two wells of the Colombian El Cerrej\u00f3n coal mine (Figs. 10 and 12), represented by the Cerrej\u00f3n Fm, which was deposited in tidal flats and coastal lagoons and flooded coastal-plain environments. In this case, a pollen diagram is provided showing that the sequences were dominated by non-mangrove associations such as Proxapertites spp., palm pollen (including Mauritiidites), a category named \u201cangiosperms\u201d and fern spores. Spinizonocolpites was found in a single coal seam, and Deltoidospora was not mentioned (Jaramillo et al., 2007).\n\n\n3.3\nEocene\n\nGonz\u00e1lez Guzm\u00e1n (1967) performed pioneering quantitative palynological studies on the Early-Middle Eocene Mirador Fm in the Tib\u00fa area, close to the Colombian-Venezuelan border (Figs. 10 and 12). The lower half of this formation was deposited in coastal plain environments and represents a wide floodplain sequence, whereas the upper half reflects a prograding bay-head delta with increasing marine influence (Ramon and Fajardo, 2006). Gonz\u00e1lez Guzm\u00e1n (1967) did not find any known mangrove fossil representatives (Table 1) but speculated about the possibility of Brevitricolpites variabilis, an unusually common and abundant taxon in the Tib\u00fa area (Fig. 17\n), being an extinct mangrove species that would have dominated these ecosystems by that time. This finding has not been paralleled by any other studies in the region. For example, in the Rubio Road section (Figs. 10 and 12), the Mirador Fm is characterized by Retibrevitricolpites triangulatus, Striatricolpites catatumbus, Retitricolpites irregularis and Monoporites annulatus, as dominant morphospecies, and neither Brevitricolpites nor any other mangrove element has been reported (Germeraad et al., 1968). The same is true for the Mirador interval from other Venezuelan sections, such as R\u00edo Lobaterita, R\u00edo Lora and R\u00edo Chama outcrops (Figs. 10 and 12), which are dominated by fluvial plain taxa (Mauritiidites, Proxapertites, Cicatricosisporites) and freshwater algae (Pediastrum, Botryococcus), and only a few single scattered occurrences of Spinizonocolpites pollen grains were recorded as representatives of mangrove elements (Pocknall and Erlich, 2020).\nIn the Colombian La Regadera section (Figs. 10 and 12), the Mirador Fm was dominated by similar inland assemblages, and Brevitricolpites was present (2 pollen grains) in a single sample (Jaramillo and Dilcher, 2001). Additionally, in Colombia, the Early\/Middle Eocene is represented in the Pi\u00f1alerita and Uribe sections by the El Limbo\/San Fernando and La Paz formations, respectively (Figs. 10 and 12). In these sections, the situation is very similar, although in the Pi\u00f1alerita section, some Spinizonocolpites (Nypa) species were recorded in low abundances in the Middle Eocene. Unfortunately, no pollen diagrams were provided, and only raw counts are available for these three sections (Jaramillo and Dilcher, 2001). The San Fernando Formation is also present in the La Paz del R\u00edo section (Figs. 10 and 12), with the same palynological characteristics (Germeraad et al., 1968).\nThe other important Early\/Middle Eocene sedimentary unit present in the study area is the Misoa Fm, which extends over the Venezuelan Maracaibo Basin and is considered to be the lateral equivalent of the Mirador Fm (Gonz\u00e1lez de Juana et al., 1980). This formation has traditionally been interpreted as a deltaic to pro-deltaic deposit, whose marine character increases toward the NE. However, Higgs (1996) proposed that the Misoa sediments were deposited on a marine shelf. In both cases, the marine influence was greater than in the more inland Mirador Fm and the possibility of finding mangrove pollen assemblages, if they actually existed, seems higher. The Misoa Fm has been subdivided into two informal units, the C-sands and the B-sands, roughly corresponding to the Early and Middle Eocene, respectively (Gonz\u00e1lez de Juana et al., 1980).\nA classical Misoa palynological section is present in the Icotea-1 well, which was studied palynologically by Germeraad et al. (1968). The exact location of this well was not provided by these authors, but it is presumed that the well was drilled in Lake Maracaibo, at some place along the Icotea Fault, which crosses the lake from SW to NE, or near Icotea Hill (Fig. 10). The Misoa Fm is well developed in all these settings. The semiquantitative record of the Icotea-1 well showed significant differences between the Misoa B and C sands, especially in mangrove-related morphospecies. The Spinizonocolpites group (Nypa) was abundant over the entire section, except for the uppermost part of the C-sand interval. However, Lanagiopollis crassa (Pelliciera) was almost absent in the C-sand interval but was one of the dominant species in the B-sand interval (Fig. 18\n). This was the first appearance of this morphospecies, which represents the first occurrence of a structural mangrove-tree representative in the Caribbean region. In the Prevenci\u00f3n area (Figs. 10 and 12), an extensive record of the Misoa Fm showed the same palynological patterns as the Icotea-1 well, especially in the continuous and abundant presence of L. crassa (Pelliciera) over the entire Middle Eocene record (Germeraad et al., 1968). In this case, however, the Spinizonocolpites group was almost absent, showing significant lateral differences between closer sections. In both the Icotea-1 and Prevenci\u00f3n sections, Deltoidospora adriennis (Acrostichum) was not recorded (Germeraad et al., 1968).\nQuantitative palynological studies on the Misoa Fm are also available for the Early Eocene of the Riecito Mach\u00e9 section and the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) of a VLC well from Lake Maracaibo Block III (Figs. 10 and 12). In the Riecito Mach\u00e9 section, the Early Eocene part studied was characterized by three main palynological assemblages (Rull, 1999): inland marsh forests (Striatricolpites catatumbus, Retibrevitricolpites triangularis, Retitricolpites irregularis), undefined continental (Proxapertites operculatus, Retitricolpites amapaensis) and transitional fluvial\/coastal marshes (Deltoidospora adriennis, Mauritiidites franciscoi, Verrucatosporites speciosus, Psilamonocolpites medius). These assemblages showed alternating trends of variation without a definite strtatigraphic pattern along the sequence (Fig. 19\n). As in the Paleocene interval of the same section (Fig. 16), Deltoidospora (Acrostichum) and Mauritiidites (Mauritia) appeared together, which indicates that the coastal marshes\/swamps represented in this sequence were transitional between fluvial and coastal plains and were flooded by freshwater or water of low salinity.\nThe Lutetian VLC interval (Fig. 20\n) was characterized by four main assemblages (Rull, 1998c): inland forests represented by Retitricolpites simplex and Retimonocolpites fossulatus; back-mangrove palm swamps dominated by Longapertites proxapertitoides and Mauritiidites franciscoi; back-mangrove fern swamps dominated by Deltoidospora adriennis (Acrostichum) and Verrucatosporites speciosus; and a mangrove-forest assemblage with Lanagiopollis crassa (Pelliciera) and Spinizonocolpites echinatus\/S. prominatus (Nypa). This palynological sequence shows a typical mangrove assemblage with the necessary ingredients for a mangrove ecosystem (Fig. 4), that is, a Pelliciera-dominated mangrove forest along the coastline, with Nypa in the understory or immediately behind Pelliciera, still in saline waters, and a back-mangrove complex with a progressively decreasing salinity gradient dominated by ferns (Acrostichum) in the brackish-water swamps and palms (Mauritia) in the freshwater environments. This Lutetian section was dated using palynostratigraphic zonation developed specifically for western Venezuela (Muller et al., 1987), and included the upper part of the Echitriporites trianguliformis zone, the Retitricolporites magnus zone and the lower part of the Bombacacidites soleaformis zone, which allowed estimation of the age of the sequence to be <49 to >41\u00a0Ma (Rull, 1998c). The strong association between L. crassa (Pelliciera) and S. echinatus\/S. prominatus (Nypa) and the significant increase in the former in the Middle Eocene coincided with the observations in other sections, such as those formerly analyzed from Icotea-1 and Prevenci\u00f3n (Germeraad et al., 1968). In Colombia, Lanagiopollis crassa (Pelliciera) and the Spinizonocolpites group (Nypa) also showed local peaks of abundance in the Middle Eocene part of the Sagu section (De la Parra et al., 2021) (Figs. 10 and 12). In the Pi\u00f1alerita section, an increase in the abundance of both morphospecies was also evident in the Early\/Middle Eocene transition (Jaramillo and Dilcher, 2001). All this evidence together suggests a regional event of mangrove formation.\n\n\n\n4\nThe oldest Caribbean mangroves\nThis section discusses the evidence reviewed above in terms of the potential existence of truly Late Cretaceous to Eocene mangrove communities in the southern Caribbean region, considering the requirements of quantitative palynology to characterize past communities, as explained in the introduction.\nThe available palynological evidence for the Late Cretaceous sediments points toward the occurrence of a single mangrove element, the Spinizonocolpites group, in coastal to shallow marine environments. This fossil pollen type is considered to represent the modern mangrove palm Nypa (Table 1), which currently lives on the brackish-water back-mangrove belts of the Indo-Mayan region (Fig. 9). According to Frederiksen (1985), the pollen of Nypa is mainly locally dispersed, and due to its low production and low buoyancy, a small amount of this pollen is enough to infer the proximity of the parent plant. This has been confirmed by studies on modern pollen deposition (Pandey and Minckley, 2019). Therefore, the percentages found in the Late Cretaceous coastal and shallow marine environments discussed above would be consistent with the presence of Nypa palms among the coastal vegetation. However, this is not evidence for the occurrence of mangrove communities because of the absence of fossil representatives of known mangrove-forming trees and other mangrove associates. High percentages of Nypa pollen could be due to downstream transportation and further concentration in shallow marine environments or to expansions of Nypa palm populations, fostered by its above-mentioned invasion ability in coastal areas where the original vegetation has been removed (Numbere, 2019). In this case, increases in Nypa pollen in the fossil record could be linked to events of vegetation removal, probably by climatic changes or enhanced coastal erosion, but this is still too speculative in the present state of knowledge.\nThe Paleocene sediments from the Colombian and Venezuelan localities reviewed were deposited in more continental environments and were dominated by non-mangrove taxa. The transition from the Maastrichtian to the Paleocene was characterized by a change from shallow marine to coastal environments, which led to the disappearance of Spinizonocolpites (Nypa) and the incoming of more inland taxa that dominated during the Paleocene. The only well-represented mangrove element was Deltoidospora adriennis (Acrostichum), which has been found in some Venezuelan sections. As in the case of Nypa, Acrostichum is not a structural element of mangrove ecosystems, and its preferred habitat is the back-mangrove zonal fringe flooded by low-salinity water or freshwater (Fig. 4), which is supported by its association with the freshwater palm Mauritia (Mauritiidites). Therefore, as observed in the Late Cretaceous, evidence for mangrove ecosystems in the southern Caribbean area during the Paleocene is still lacking. Interestingly, Deltoidospora is not mentioned in the Colombian localities, which suggests the occurrence of more inland (fluvial) environments (Fig. 12). It is also worth noting that in the studied sections, Spinizonocolpites and Deltoidospora did not occur together, which may be due to the contrasting environmental requirements of these taxa combined with frequent lateral facies changes. Some problems in the identification of Deltoidospora adriennis could also be involved (Frederiksen, 1985).\nDuring the Early Eocene, the situation remained similar to that in the Paleocene, except in the case of Brevitricolpites variabilis, which was proposed to be a mangrove-forming tree by Gonz\u00e1lez Guzm\u00e1n (1967). However, problems in the original definition of this morphospecies (Jaramillo and Dilcher, 2001), the lack of botanical affinities of this fossil pollen with known mangrove species and the absence of other known mangrove elements, did not support this proposal. In addition, this morphospecies was not further recorded in the region at abundances similar to those on the original reference, and there are no further mentions of its eventual mangrove-forming character. The combination of taxonomic problems, lacking botanical affinities and restricted spatiotemporal occurrence of B. variabilis prevents consideration of this morphospecies as a relevant element in the evolution of Caribbean mangroves. The situation changed in the Middle Eocene, when quantitative pollen\/spore records were compatible with the occurrence of true mangrove ecosystems, with Pelliciera as the dominant mangrove-forming tree and Nypa, Acrostichum and Mauritia as the most important plant elements of a decreasing salinity gradient from marine conditions to freshwater. This is considered the first available robust evidence of mangrove ecosystems in the Caribbean region. Back-mangrove elements were already present, alone or in different combinations, in older sediments (Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene) from coastal environments. However, the lack of a dominant mangrove-forming tree species at the forefront and the lack of a zonal distribution of back-mangrove elements along the coastal-inland salinity gradient hindered inference of the occurrence of typical mangrove communities using quantitative criteria.\n\n\n5\nConclusions and final remarks\nAccording to the available quantitative palynological evidence, the first Caribbean mangroves would have originated in the southern part of this region (today's Colombia and Venezuela) during the Middle Eocene (Lutetian), probably between 50 and 40\u00a0Ma. These mangrove communities were characterized by Pelliciera (Lanagiopollis crassa) as the dominant mangrove-forming tree growing along the coastline, and the palm Nypa (Spinizonocolpites spp.) in the understory or immediately beyond Pelliciera, still in the tidal zone. Back-mangrove communities would have been dominated by the fern Acrostichum (Deltoidospora adriennis) and Mauritia (Mauritiidites franciscoi) and other palms (Psilamonocolpites spp.) following a decreasing sea-inland salinity gradient from brackish water to freshwater. L. crassa, the fossil representative of Pelliciera, first appeared in the Early Eocene and was already widespread in other Caribbean areas during the Middle Eocene (Graham, 1977, 1995, 2009). This suggests that the Caribbean mangrove communities originating in the southern region were rapidly dispersed over the Caribbean region, probably facilitated by the migration of the Caribbean plate (Fig. 11). Detailed moroghological and genomic studies have suggested the occurrence of two variants, of unknown taxonomic rank, within Pelliciera rhizophorae: Variant A, living in wet zones, and Variant B, growing in areas with low rainfall. It has been suggested that these variants could have diversified early in response to environmental conditions or pollination vectors (Castillo-C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2016).\nThe whole picture indicates that, contrary to former views, the Caribbean mangroves were not the direct descendants of Late-Cretaceous Tethyan mangroves but originated de novo much later, in the Middle Eocene, after the evolutionary appearance of Pelliciera, the first mangrove-forming tree recorded to date in the region. The emergence of Pelliciera seems to have been a keystone event that would have acted as a \u201ccondensation nucleus\u201d for the organization and development of a novel ecosystem, the mangroves, by recruiting species already adapted to tidal conditions (e.g., Nypa, Acrostichum), promoting the adaptation of others to saline and brackish-water environments and facilitating the evolutionary emergence of post-Eocene mangrove-forming tree taxa (e.g., Rhizophora, Avicennia) that might not have originated outside mangrove ecosystems. As discussed in the introduction, it has become clear that mangrove-forming trees are mandatory for the existence of mangrove ecosystems. As shown in this review, the first mangrove-forming tree of the Caribbean fossil record was Pelliciera, which originated in the Early Eocene and dominated the coastal environments in the Middle Eocene. In addition, the existence of a typical zonal mangrove pattern including the mangrove forest itself and a back-mangrove community gradient toward inland environments has been documented. This taxonomic and structural ecological pattern did not exist before in the study area. Therefore, the Caribbean region would have been devoid of mangrove ecosystems until the Middle Eocene, as the hypothetical Late Cretaceous and Paleocene mangrove communities have not been observed in the quantitative pollen records. Such a different paleobiogeographic and evolutionary scenario would lead to the reconsideration of current theories about the origin and evolution of mangroves, in general, as most of them are based on progressive regional differentiation from an assumed homogeneous Late Cretaceous pantropical mangrove belt.\nAs absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, it cannot be ruled out that future studies may find quantitative evidence for Caribbean mangroves predating the Middle Eocene. However, with the available evidence, the above conclusions are the most parsimonious. It is hoped that this new perspective can serve as a basis and a source of encouragement for further developments in this field of research. It would be especially interesting to apply the quantitative approach to other tropical\/subtropical regions holding mangrove communities, to attain a more robust and global assessment of mangrove origin and evolution. The main focus in this type of study should be the identification of potential mangrove-forming trees and the finding of a characteristic zonal mangrove pattern using quantitative paleoecological reconstructions. Presence\/absence fossil records of individual salinity-tolerant taxa cannot be used to identify and reconstruct past mangrove communities.\n\n","77":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Devonian Period lasted for around 60 million years, and spanned the time from 419 to 359 million years ago (Becker et al., 2020). The Devonian was a key interval in which land-plant cover expanded from a ground-level green skin, localized in wet habitats, to extensive forests across humid regions (Le Hir et al., 2011). The first seed plants appeared in the middle Famennian (Prestianni and Gerrienne, 2010), and the first terrestrial tetrapods in the Eifelian (Nied\u017awiedzki et al., 2010). Life flourished in the oceans, and marine faunas attained their highest genus-level richness for the entire Paleozoic in the Givetian-Frasnian (e.g., Bambach et al., 2002). At the same time, reefs with a high diversity of metazoan organisms reached their peak abundance for the Paleozoic (Kiessling et al., 2003). Devonian paleogeography comprised three major continents. The largest of these, Gondwana, consisted of present-day South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia, and was positioned in the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere. Gondwana made up more than half of all landmass on Earth (Torsvik, 2019). Laurussia consisted of North America, Greenland and Baltica and was positioned in low latitudes, straddling the equator, while Siberia was positioned in the northern hemisphere (Torsvik and Cocks, 2013). During the Devonian, the terrestrial facies of the \u2018Old Red Sandstone\u2019 were deposited in large parts of present-day northwest Europe, Greenland and northeast North America. The climate during the Devonian is generally considered to be warm (Joachimski et al., 2009; Marcilly et al., 2021; Scotese et al., 2021). Throughout the Middle and Late Devonian, the atmospheric pO2 rose from ~0.7 of the present-day atmospheric level (PAL) to present-day concentration, while pCO2 has been interpreted to have dropped from 5.0-6.0 PAL to just slightly more than the pre-industrial Holocene level, based on modelling (Lenton et al., 2018). This major shift in Earth surface conditions is likely linked to the spread of land vegetation, including wetland forests (Le Hir et al., 2011; Strother et al., 2010). At the end of the Devonian, the climate cooled and gradually descended into the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, with a first glaciation event during the Famennian (Lakin et al., 2016). The Devonian was a time of many biotic crises in the marine realm, particularly in the Middle and Late Devonian. As reviewed by McGhee et al. (2013), the genus-level taxonomic loss identifies four Devonian extinctions (latest Eifelian, late Givetian, Frasnian-Famennian, Devonian-Carboniferous boundary) in the 10 most severe extinctions of the post-Cambrian Phanerozoic. These same events also enter the top-ten list based on estimates of their ecologic severity (McGhee et al., 2013). Other events during the Devonian were taxonomic radiations, a cascade of evolutionary innovations in marine faunas and sudden spreads of marine organisms linked to transgressions (Becker et al., 2016). Causes for nearly all of these perturbations are still heavily debated (e.g., Aretz, 2021; Boyer et al., 2021; Fields et al., 2020; Kaiho et al., 2021; Marshall, 2021; McGhee and Racki, 2021; Paschall et al., 2019). Many of the perturbations share similarities, as most are coincident with spreads of shelfal anoxia, manifested as deposits of black shale with a shallow, often photic-zone chemocline fluctuation in the water column (Kabanov and Jiang, 2020). Some of them also share anoxia-linked effects, such as narrowing benthic habitats and ocean acidification. The nature and magnitude of sea-level fluctuations during the Devonian is still a matter of debate (Carmichael et al., 2019; Kabanov and Jiang, 2020). Two of the Devonian perturbations are classified as major mass extinction events, firstly at the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (Kellwasser; see Carmichael et al., 2019) and secondly at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (Hangenberg; see Kaiser et al., 2016).\nSince the early days of paleomagnetism, researchers have focused on obtaining paleopoles from Devonian rocks to reconstruct paleolatitudes and motions of the continents. However, Devonian paleomagnetic data have been troubling, with many later studies arguing that data from previous studies were unreliable due to remagnetisations (e.g., Abrajevitch et al., 2007; A\u00effa, 1993; A\u00effa et al., 1990; Bachtadse et al., 1987; Bachtadse and Briden, 1991; Bachtadse and Briden, 1990; Bachtadse and Briden, 1989; Briden et al., 1984; Huang et al., 2000; Schmidt et al., 1986; Smethurst and Khramov, 1992; Stearns et al., 1989). Although there is a wealth of studies that have attempted to obtain Devonian paleopoles, very few datasets are now considered of good quality (Van der Voo\u2019s Q >3; Van der Voo, 1990). This has resulted in a scarcity of reliable data for the reconstruction of apparent polar wander paths (Torsvik et al., 2012). This dearth of data also impacts the sparse knowledge of geomagnetic polarity changes during the Devonian (see Fig. 1\n). Although polarity patterns are presented for the Early Devonian and part of the Middle Devonian (Becker et al., 2012), and more recently also for the Late Devonian (Becker et al., 2020; Hansma et al., 2015; Ogg et al., 2016a), large portions of the Devonian are unresolved in detail (marked with grey in the timescale; Fig. 1). The magnetic polarity patterns have furthermore not been confirmed through studies of sections in different parts of the world, or are based on data that are poorly accessible (Lower and Middle Devonian; e.g., Guzhikov, 2019; Ogg and Smith, 2004). There is a strong need for many more magnetostratigraphic studies in the Paleozoic, and especially the Devonian. Studies on the strength of the magnetic field (paleointensity), show that it was very weak during the Devonian (e.g., Hawkins, 2018; Hawkins et al., 2021; Hawkins et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2021; Shcherbakova et al., 2017). Several studies have also hypothesised that the field was non-dipolar in some time intervals (Shatsillo and Pavlov, 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2017).\n\n1.1\nThis study\nWe set out to study several different Devonian sections of sedimentary rocks for magnetostratigraphy; to test reproducibility two sites with overlapping ages were chosen. Sections with low thermal maturity were selected, as indicated by a low conodont colour alteration index (CAI; Epstein et al., 1977; Rejebian et al., 1987) or Tmax parameter (Peters and Cassa, 1994). CAI values of less than 3 indicate that sedimentary rocks were heated to an estimated maximum temperature of 200 \u00b0C (e.g., K\u00f6nigshof, 2003), which is below the resetting temperature of magnetic minerals that are typically ideal magnetic recorders. A Tmax of less than 465\u00b0C is an indication that the kerogen thermal maturation did not proceed beyond the oil window (Peters and Cassa, 1994). Sections that do not show evidence for extensive remineralisation were explored, to maximise chances that these sections preserved a primary signal of the ancient magnetic field. We sampled four sections in Germany, Poland and Canada, in order to constrain the magnetostratigraphy of the Middle Devonian to the earliest Mississippian (see Fig. 2\n). A comparison of our data to the body of published paleomagnetic studies and review of the Devonian geomagnetic polarity timescale, paleopoles and paleointensity data was then performed. We discuss possible explanations for the prevalence of suboptimal data and controversial findings in this time period and present a hypothesis purporting that the paleomagnetic field was non-uniformitarian through some or all of the Devonian. A non-uniformitarian field may have contributed to a \u201cDevonian paleomagnetic wasteland\u201d as well as other geological phenomena reported at this time.\n\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\n\n2.1\nBlankenheim, Germany\nThe Blankenheim section in the Eifel region of Germany (50.44104\u00b0N, 6.63705\u00b0E) comprises ca. 8 m of shales and carbonates (Junkerberg Fm and Freilingen Fm) of Eifelian age (K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016). The section covers most of the Tortodus kockelianus conodont zone. Although the lower boundary of this conodont zone is unconstrained in the section, the top of the section contains the boundary between the kockelianus Zone and the overlying Polygnathus ensensis Zone (transition from the Junkerberg Fm to the Freilingen Fm; Fig. 3\n). Colour alteration indices for the Blankenheim section show very low values for Devonian conodonts, around 1.5-2.0, indicating very low thermal maturity, equating to a maximum temperature of heating of ca. 80 \u00b0C (K\u00f6nigshof, 2003; K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016).\n\n\n2.2\nRac\u0142awka and Czatkowice, Poland\nThe Rac\u0142awka and Czatkowice sections are located in southern Poland, near the city of Krakow (Krzeszowice area). The Czatkowice section (50.15944\u00b0 N, 19.64142\u00b0 E) is the longer of the two, and is in a working quarry. The Rac\u0142awka section is located in the Rac\u0142awka Valley to the northeast of Czatkowice (50.17872\u00b0 N, 19.68244\u00b0 E). Both sections contain late Devonian-early Carboniferous limestones, which are correlated to sections in Belgium based on a foraminifer and coral biostratigraphy (Poty et al., 2007). The precise Devonian-Carboniferous level in the sections is not known, as the lithologies represent a shallow environment that lacks conodonts. Southern Poland was part of the Moravia-Silesia Basin during the Late Devonian and Mississippian, with the study region forming part of a carbonate platform that existed from the Eifelian (Middle Devonian) to the Vis\u00e9an (a European stage correlating to the Middle Mississippian; Belka et al., 1996; Dvor\u00e1k et al., 1995; Poty et al., 2007; W\u00f3jcik, 2012). The Devonian-Carboniferous succession in the Czatkowice Quarry and Rac\u0142awka Valley was described by Paszkowski (in Dvor\u00e1k et al., 1995), \u0141apta\u015b (1982) and Narkiewicz and Racki (1984). Paszkowski divided the lower part of the succession into 6 formations (from base to top): the Dubie Formation with the G\u00f3ra \u017barska Member at its top, Rac\u0142awka Formation, Szklary Formation, Pacz\u00f3\u0142towice Formation, Pstr\u0105garnia Formation and Przy Granicy Quarry Formation. The combined thickness of these formations is about 450 m. The succession of Carboniferous shallow-water limestones in the Czatkowice quarry is almost one kilometre thick, with the stratigraphic interval from the Czatkowice quarry in the Rac\u0142awka Formation (containing the supposed Devonian-Carboniferous boundary level in the eastern quarry front), to the Czerna Formation of Vis\u00e9an age (Paszkowski, in: Dvor\u00e1k et al., 1995; Poty et al., 2007). Conodont biostratigraphy from the Przy Granicy Formation indicates an upper Tournaisian age (Gnathodus cuneiformis Zone; Appelt, 1998). Nearly 100 samples from 32 levels were collected from the Rac\u0142awka Fm and Szklary Fm during several field campaigns from 2016-2018 (Fig. 4\n). CAI values at the sampled sections are around 1, although other localised areas closer to Permian intrusions have higher CAI (Belka, 1993).\n\n\n2.3\nProhibition Creek, Canada\nProhibition Creek (65.18776\u00b0 N, 126.22096\u00b0 W) is located near Norman Wells, in the centre of the Sahtu First Nation Lands of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Prohibition Creek is a small creek that cuts the Norman Range of the Franklin Mountains and feeds into the Mackenzie River. Outcrops along Prohibition Creek range in age from Cambrian to Late Devonian (Fallas and McNaughton, 2013). We assessed the limestones of the Middle Devonian Hume Formation and the basinal mudrocks of the Middle Devonian Hare Indian and Frasnian Canol Formations (Kabanov, 2022). For an extended description of these units at Prohibition Creek, we refer to Kabanov et al. (2019). The Hare Indian and Canol shales were found too fissile to sample for paleomagnetic core plugs, therefore we focused on the limestones of the Hume Formation. Similar to the Blankenheim section, the Hume Formation covers the Tortodus kockelianus Zone of the Eifelian (Gouwy, 2022). In the Hume type section along the Hume River, the base of the Hume Fm is in the Tortodus australis Zone of earliest Late Eifelian age (Uyeno et al., 2017). The top of the Hume Fm, similar to the Blankenheim section, is in the Polygnathus ensensis Zone. The sampled interval in Prohibition Creek covers only the upper half of the Hume Fm. The lower part of the Hume Fm was not sampled, so comparisons of thickness between the Hume River and Prohibition Creek sections are difficult. The thickness of the Hume Fm is estimated to be 114.3 metres (Gouwy et al., 2021). The Prohibition Creek section was selected for its location in a zone of low thermal maturity where Tmax is within 426-465\u00b0C and where organic-matter biomarkers are well preserved (Kabanov and Jiang, 2020). Like the Blankenheim section, the CAI values in Prohibition Creek are very low (1.5-2.0; Gouwy, 2006). Because the Blankenheim section and the Prohibition Creek section both cover the same interval, they provide an excellent opportunity for comparison of paleomagnetic records from two different parts of the globe during the Eifelian. A lithological log of the section with sample positions is shown in Fig. 5\n.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nBlankenheim, Germany\nIn July 2019, 100 samples were collected for magnetostratigraphy in the carbonates of the Blankenheim section. Standard paleomagnetic cores (25 mm \u00d8) were drilled using a gasoline-powered motor drill, and oriented using a magnetic compass. Shales in the section were too fissile to sample. Directions were corrected for a present-day declination (International Geomagnetic Reference Field; IGRF) of 2\u00b0. We provide a glossary of paleomagnetic acronyms in Table 1\n. Cores were subsequently cut into ca. 22 mm long specimens, and were processed at the University of Liverpool. A total of 39 specimens were subjected to stepwise thermal demagnetisation, 40 were demagnetised using three axis static alternating field (AF) demagnetisation, and another 29 specimens were demagnetised using a combination of thermal and AF demagnetisation. Thermal demagnetisation was performed by progressive heating in a shielded furnace with a hold time of one hour at peak temperature, in steps of 20-55 \u00b0C, up to 400 \u00b0C. AF demagnetisation was performed on the automated RAPID 2G-Entreprises Superconducting Rock Magnetometer (hereafter referred to as \u201cRAPID\u201d), equipped with three DC-SQUIDS (direct current-superconducting quantum interference device), and a noise level of ca. 1x10-12 Am2, which measures a singly positioned specimen with four measurements of each axis. As specimens were weak, we flipped the samples and measured four positions again after each step, so each specimen was measured eight times in total per step. Typical holder magnetisations were less than 10 \u03bcA\/m.\nFor specimens from all locations, magnetisations were calculated using principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) visualised on Zijderveld diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), using the interpretation portal of http:\/\/Paleomagnetism.org (Koymans et al., 2016). The bedding dips of the Blankenheim section were near horizontal, so no tectonic correction was applied here. Mean directions were calculated using Fisher statistics (Fisher, 1953). We fitted great-circles when components with overlapping blocking temperatures or coercivity spectra were present. Lines and planes were inferred following an eigenvector approach (Kirschvink, 1980). We use the method of McFadden and McElhinny (1988) to determine specimen mean directions for the great-circle solutions.\nSusceptibility versus temperature (up to 700 \u00b0C in air) runs were performed on representative specimens using an MFK-1 Kappabridge with CS4 furnace and a sensitivity of 10-7 SI. Multiple heating (6\u00b0\/minute) and cooling runs (10\u00b0\/minute) were performed. Room temperature susceptibility measurements were conducted using the same Kappabridge.\n\n\n3.2\nRac\u0142awka and Czatkowice, Poland\nOriented hand samples were taken from the Rac\u0142awka section (R sample codes) and Czatkowice quarry (C sample codes), from which conventional paleomagnetic cores (25 mm \u00d8) were drilled in the paleomagnetic laboratory of the Polish Geological Institute. 24 hand samples from the Czatkowice quarry were taken, as well as 12 of the Rac\u0142awka section. The sampled part for this study contains the uppermost part of the Rac\u0142awka Formation, which encompasses the presumed Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, and the lower part of the Szklary Fm. A tentative correlation between the Rac\u0142awka and Czatkowice sections was based on the levels of characteristic oolitic-layers assumed as the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary interval (Fig. 4). Samples were processed at the Paleomagnetic laboratory Fort Hoofddijk, of Utrecht University, the Netherlands. In total 98 specimens were subjected to thermal (66 specimens), as well as AF (98 specimens) demagnetisation. Thermal demagnetisation was performed in a magnetically shielded furnace to maximum temperatures of 340 \u00b0C, using temperature increments of 20\u201360 \u00b0C. Thermally demagnetised specimens were subsequently treated with AF demagnetisation to avoid alteration-induced magnetisations (cf. van Velzen and Zijderveld, 1995). AF demagnetisation was performed with steps of 4\u201310 mT using an in-house built robotized system (dynamic range 3 \u00d7 10-12 to 5 \u00d7 10-5 Am2; Mullender et al., 2016). After each demagnetisation step, the natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) was measured eight times on a 2G Enterprise horizontal cryogenic magnetometer equipped with three DC-SQUIDS (noise level 3\u00d7 10\u221212 Am2). Typical holder magnetisations were less than 20 \u03bcA\/m. Declination (D) and inclination (I) angles were calculated for pre-tilt (TC) and post-tilt (NOTC) signals.\nThermomagnetic runs were performed on powdered samples, using a modified horizontal translation balance with a cycling field, usually 150\u2013300 mT (Mullender et al., 1993). Six cycles of heating and cooling were performed, up to a temperature of 700 \u00b0C. Isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM) acquisition curves were obtained up to 700 mT (pulsed field) and measured using a robotized SQUID magnetometer (Mullender et al., 2016). Kappabridge measurements were performed at the geomagnetism laboratory of the University of Liverpool, using the AGICO MFK-1 with a furnace attachment. Six heating and cooling cycles were performed on powdered samples up to a temperature of 700\u00b0C. Samples were repeatedly heated and cooled, after which the susceptibility was measured. Bulk susceptibility measurements were conducted at room temperature using the same Kappabridge.\nA total of 5 specimens from Czatkowice (sample code CQ) were studied for hysteresis and back-field analysis using a Magnetic Measurements Advanced Variable Field Translation Balance (MMAVFTB) at the University of Liverpool. All resulting loops were corrected for the paramagnetic component and analysed using RockMag Analyzer (Leonhardt, 2006).\nThese same specimens were subject to measurements of frequency dependent susceptibility using an Agico MFK1 Kappabridge operating at frequencies of 976 Hz, 3.9 kHz and 15.6 kHz. Measured susceptibilities were around noise\/holder level in some cases, which was recognised as increases in the susceptibility of > 10% at one of the two higher frequencies. Two samples were rejected for giving too noisy susceptibility readings.\n\n\n3.3\nProhibition Creek, Canada\n115 samples were taken at 44 levels over 60 metres of section of the Hume Formation, as well as 6 samples from 3 levels of the Canol shale. Sampling methods and laboratory procedures were the same as described earlier for the samples from Germany. All measured orientations in the field were corrected for a local declination of 20\u00b0 (IGRF). A total of 40 specimens were subjected to stepwise thermal demagnetisation, 12 were demagnetised using AF demagnetisation, and another 81 specimens were demagnetised using a combination of thermal and AF demagnetisation. Typical holder magnetisations were less than 20 \u03bcA\/m.\nHysteresis and frequency-dependent susceptibility experiments followed those performed on the Poland samples and were based on 7 specimens taken from the Prohibition Creek locality. Three of these samples were rejected for giving too noisy susceptibility readings.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nBlankenheim, Germany\n\n4.1.1\nRock magnetic results\nMagnetic susceptibility was usually below 10 x 10-6 SI at the start of the experiment. Magnetic susceptibility then increases slightly upon heating, after which a drop follows at a temperature of ~580\u00b0C, the Curie temperature of magnetite (Fig. 6\n). All specimens show a peak just before 580\u00b0C, which could be a Hopkinson peak (e.g., Dunlop, 2014), which is indicative of single domain (SD)\/pseudo-single domain (PSD, or vortex state; Roberts et al., 2017) magnetite. Alternatively, this peak could be related to silicate or pyrite alteration, which is often the case in sediments. Susceptibility generally is much higher after heating, showing irreversible behaviour from 300-400\u00b0C, indicating the formation of new magnetic minerals. This is also seen by the large susceptibility increase upon cooling below 600\u00b0C, all indicative of substantial thermal alteration.\nHysteresis data (K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016; see Fig. 7\n) point to low values of saturation magnetisation and ferrimagnetic susceptibility, indicative of trace amounts of ferrimagnetic minerals. Compared to the ferrimagnetic susceptibility, high field susceptibility values are one order of magnitude larger, indicative of a very small contribution of ferrimagnetic minerals and probably little or no creation of new magnetic minerals through mineralisation. The remanence is still increasing above 300 mT, indicative of a proportion of high-coercivity minerals (such as hematite) and points to a mixture of both low and higher coercivity phases. The time-dependent decay of an IRM500mT (isothermal remanent magnetisation at 500 mT) was measured over 100 s and the normalized viscosity coefficient corresponds to the slope in the IRM500mT decay versus Log10 of the time in seconds. The results obtained (K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016) are indicative of a slow decay and relatively coarse grains in the range of SD. Accordingly, the hysteresis data in a Day plot (see Fig. 8\n) fall along the pseudo-single domain (PSD) and single domain + multi domain (SD + MD) mixing curve (Dunlop, 2002). These results point to the occurrence of trace amounts of ferrimagnetic grains, with a relatively coarse grain size, probably of detrital origin.\n\n\n4.1.2\nDirections\nSamples from the Blankenheim section generally have NRM intensities of 10-100 \u03bcA\/m and measurements on the RAPID magnetometer were challenging, as the RAPID would often give erratic measurements. To avoid these erratic measurements, we sometimes measured specimens several times, and excluded all measurements that have standard deviations larger than 20% of the magnetisation from interpretation. All demagnetisation data are provided in the supplementary information (files S1, S3 and S6).\nDemagnetisation behaviour generally does not define only linear segments on Zijderveld plots, but many specimens exhibit incomplete component separation characterised by demagnetisation paths along great-circles. Nearly all samples contained a low temperature\/low coercivity (LT) component in the direction of the modern field, in some cases; this could not be removed (see Fig. 9A). A large proportion of samples show a strong reversed (possibly Kiaman-age) overprint, which in many cases cannot be fully demagnetised (see Fig. 9B and 9C). Characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM) generally decreases towards the origin of the Zijderveld diagrams (see Fig. 9), although some specimens cluster (Fig. 9E and 9F) and in some cases, the paths seem to pass the origin (see Fig. 9G). The low temperature\/coercivity (LT) component has a mean direction of dec= 11.9\u00b0, inc= 66.2\u00b0, \u03b195 = 3.0\u00b0 (Fig. 9A), generally agreeing with the expected inclination of the modern GAD (geocentric axial dipole) field (around 67.6\u00b0).\nAround half of the samples show a strong southerly and negative inclination middle stability component (MT), which in most cases remains at the highest demagnetisation steps (see Fig. 9B and 9C). This component has a mean of dec= 204.9\u00b0, inc= -24.2\u00b0, \u03b195 = 5.1\u00b0 (see Fig. 10B). The APWP (apparent polar wander path) of Torsvik et al. (2012) predicts directions (converted to reverse polarity) for the Kiaman reverse superchron, (~320-260 Ma), of dec \u2248 205\u00b0 \u00b1 5\u00b0 (320 Ma) to dec \u2248 202\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 (260 Ma) and inc \u2248 12\u00b0 \u00b1 9\u00b0 (320 Ma) to inc \u2248 -34\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (260 Ma). The reverse directions that we observe in many samples agree well with Kiaman directions as expected for the location of Blankenheim between 320 Ma and 260 Ma. The mean MT component is closer to the predicted directions at 260 Ma, so we consider this component to have been acquired during the Permian. Ribbert (1983) determined peak orogenesis in the region to have occurred during the late Carboniferous, which could have resulted in overprinting. Zwing and Bachtadse (2000) report a Kiaman overprint in the Rhenish Massif with a direction of dec = 186.3\u00b0, inc = 8.0\u00b0, indicating that their direction could represent an older (late Carboniferous) overprint compared to our Blankenheim reverse polarity Kiaman directions (the \u03b195 uncertainties do not overlap).\nThe ChRM generally decreases towards the origin of the Zijderveld diagrams (see Fig. 9), although in some samples the ChRM does not fully demagnetise (Fig. 9E and 9F), and in other cases misses the origin (Fig. 9G). The mean of the ChRM component is dec = 207.5\u00b0, inc = 33.8\u00b0 and \u03b195 = 8.5. Reported directions for the Late Devonian in igneous rocks from the Frankenstein igneous complex in the Rhenish Massif are around dec = 200\u00b0, inc = 40\u00b0 for reverse polarity samples (see Fig. 10C; closed blue star), and dec = 10\u00b0, inc = -43\u00b0 for normal polarity samples (see Fig. 10C; open blue star; Zwing and Bachtadse, 2000). The mean ChRM component (69 directions and 2 great-circle solutions) in the Blankenheim section overlaps with the Late Devonian reverse polarity direction of Zwing and Bachtadse (2000). We note, however, that this direction is also an intermediate direction between a present-day field and an inferred Kiaman overprint direction (calculated from the global apparent polar wander path-GAPWaP; Torsvik et al., 2012). In some cases, it seems likely that the Kiaman direction is not fully resolved (see for example Fig. 9D and 9I). Half the specimens (73), did not yield ChRM directions, and only showed LT or MT components, and no directions resembling a Devonian normal polarity were identified.\n\n\n\n4.2\nRac\u0142awka and Czatkowice, Poland\n\n4.2.1\nRock magnetic results\nThermomagnetic runs using a Curie balance, as well as Variable Field Translation Balance (VFTB) measurements yielded no useful results because of the extremely weak magnetisations of the samples (tens to hundreds of \u03bcA\/m). Kappabridge runs show an increase in susceptibility up to ~300\u00b0C, after which the susceptibility rises more sharply up to around 420\u00b0C (Fig. 11\n). Subsequently, susceptibility starts to decrease until around 550\u00b0C, likely indicating the presence of low Ti-titanomagnetite, with specimens generally showing reversible behaviour. IRM acquisition curves are divisible into two groups according to the presence of low and high (>300 mT) coercivity phases (see Fig. 12\n). The first group, which includes the majority of samples, is dominated by a low coercivity phase (e.g., Fig. 12A, 12B) and shows virtually no sign of a high coercivity phase between 100 and 400 mT. The second group shows a smaller contribution from a low coercivity phase (Fig. 12C), and does not reach saturation at the maximum applied field of 600 mT (Fig. 12D). In contrast to the range in IRM saturation, curves of susceptibility versus temperature are fully dominated by a single phase in both groups, suggesting the dominance of magnetic carriers with Curie temperature < 580\u00b0C (e.g., Fig. 12A vs Fig. 12C), which are presumed to be magnetite. Hysteresis loops measured for 5 specimens (Fig. 13\n) showed no evidence of wasp-waisting and saturated at 300-400 mT. On a Day plot (Day et al., 1977), they plot in the pseudo-single domain (PSD) region and intermediate between SD-MD and superparamagnetic-single domain (SP-SD) mixing curves of Dunlop (Dunlop, 2002) (Fig. 6). Frequency-dependent susceptibility was negligible (decreases < 3%), supporting the interpretation that only an insignificant proportion of SP grains might be associated with chemical remagnetisation (Jackson and Swanson-Hysell, 2012).\n\n\n4.2.2\nDirections\nThree components of magnetisation are observed (Fig. 14\n), corresponding to LT, MT and high temperature\/coercivity (HT) intervals. Thermal demagnetisation was generally successful up to 300\u00b0C; at higher temperatures, uncertainties on the measurements became very large (>20%). Samples show low NRM intensities, ca. 10-100 \u03bcA\/m (see Fig. 4). Some samples (e.g., R3; see supplementary file S3) show intensities of <5 \u03bcA\/m and uncertainties on measurements of these samples are often more than 100%. In some cases, samples show components that resemble a modern field (Fig. 14A), or a Kiaman field (as calculated from the GAPWaP of Torsvik et al., 2012; Fig. 14B). The most well-resolved specimens show three components (Fig. 14C-H), which we interpret to represent a recent field carried by soft magnetic carriers (LT), a Kiaman field overprint (MT), and a HT component, interpreted to record a primary Devonian field, respectively. Demagnetisation behaviour commonly consists of overlapping components, indicated by demagnetisation paths following great-circles (e.g., C21.2, Fig. 11F, C20.1, Fig. 14H). One sample (R8.3; supplementary file S3) shows a very strong magnetisation (~500 times stronger than other samples) and demagnetises in a straight line towards the origin of the Zijderveld diagram. We interpret this behaviour as remagnetisation, possibly due to a lightning strike.\nThe LT component is typically demagnetised after 175\u00b0C or 16 mT (Fig. 15A), and in some samples, this component is absent. At higher demagnetisation steps, 58 specimens show a southerly and up-directed MT component, interpreted as a Kiaman component (see Fig. 15B and 15C). In 68 specimens, no ChRM could be resolved. It remains unclear whether the Kiaman direction was acquired pre-tilting (TC) or post-tilting (NOTC). Kiaman directions (TC) are dec = 187.7\u00b0, inc = -27.2\u00b0, \u03b195 = 5.3\u00b0, while Kiaman (NOTC) directions are dec = 199.5\u00b0, inc = -17.9\u00b0, \u03b195 = 5.4\u00b0. Our Kiaman averages are close to early Permian results obtained from volcanic rocks in this region by Nawrocki et al. (2008). The APWP of Torsvik et al. (2012) predicts directions for the Kiaman of dec \u2248 216\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (320 Ma) to dec \u2248 208\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0 (260 Ma) and inc \u22484\u00b0 \u00b1 10\u00b0 (320 Ma) to inc \u2248 -39\u00b0 \u00b1 4\u00b0 (260 Ma). Our directions fit with Kiaman inclinations, but declinations are more southerly than expected, which could be related to local rotation of the Moravia-Silesia block. Since this block is only expected to have moved poleward since the Permian, a post-Kiaman remagnetisation would not fit with the directions that we obtained.\nA total of 26 specimens from the Polish sections show dual polarity ChRM components, interpreted as Devonian reverse (Fig. 14C-D) and normal (Fig. 14E-H) polarities. Directions representing the Devonian normal polarity are better resolved than Devonian reverse polarity directions. Many samples show clear great-circle paths towards normal Devonian polarities. This can be explained by partial component overlap between the normal ChRM and Kiaman component, which will give much longer great-circle paths than reverse ChRM + Kiaman overlap. Specimens that represent Devonian normal polarities average to dec = 41.2\u00b0, inc = -35.1\u00b0, \u03b195 = 8.4\u00b0, while Devonian reverse polarities average to dec = 237.9\u00b0, inc = 49.9\u00b0, \u03b195 = 17.0\u00b0 (see Fig. 15D-E). These directions correspond to poles with lat = 11.5\u00b0 and long = 160.3\u00b0 (normal) and lat = -5.7\u00b0, long = 152.6\u00b0 (Devonian reversed converted to normal polarity; Table 2\n). Although the mean normal (converted) and reversed directions overlap within error (see Fig. 16\n), a reversal test using a bootstrap common true mean direction (CTMD) test (Tauxe, 2010) in http:\/\/Paleomagnetism.org (Koymans et al., 2020) is negative.\n\n\n4.2.3\nPolarity interpretation\nThe lower part of both the Czatkowice and Rac\u0142awka sections yielded mostly Kiaman overprints, but three samples indicate Devonian reverse polarity (Czatkowice; Fig. 17\n). Between 22-25 metres (Czatkowice), two samples show normal polarities. Above this, there is a reversed interval. The top of the section shows convincingly normal polarity ChRMs, and these samples display indistinguishable rock magnetic properties from the other samples. This part of the section typically shows demagnetisation along great-circle trends that end in a well-defined direction.\nThe Rac\u0142awka section is correlated to the Czatkowice section based on biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. The tops of both sections also show a similarity in demagnetisation diagrams, with samples of both sections progressing along similar great-circles and ending in similar directions (see Fig. 14E-H and supplementary file S3). The uppermost normal magnetozone of the Czatkowice quarry thus corresponds to the upper part of the Rac\u0142awka section. The available tie point for the Czatkowice quarry is the inferred position of the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary just above sample C17 (at 27 m), which correlates to the Rac\u0142awka section between samples R9 and R10 at 7.3 m (thin dashed line in Fig. 17). This suggests that the inferred Devonian-Carboniferous boundary is near the base of a normal magnetozone.\n\n\n\n4.3\nProhibition Creek, Canada\n\n4.3.1\nRock magnetic results\nSpecimens show an increase of susceptibility up to ~400\u00b0C, after which susceptibility decreases (Fig. 18\n). Specimen NW16.2 (Fig. 18A) shows a decrease until 580\u00b0C, indicating the presence of magnetite. Unlike the samples from Germany, a clear Hopkinson\/alteration peak is not observed. Specimen NW21.2 (Fig. 18B) shows a decrease until around 600\u00b0C which could indicate minor hematite. At the end of the experiment, samples have roughly the same susceptibility as at the start and samples generally show reversible behaviour.\nHysteresis loops measured for 7 specimens (Fig. 19\n) showed little or no evidence of wasp-waisting and saturated mostly at 300-400 mT. On a Day plot (Day et al., 1977), samples plot in the PSD region, mostly intermediate between SD-MD and the SP-SD mixing curves of Dunlop (2002) (Fig. 8). Frequency-dependent susceptibility was minor (decreases < 8%) and comparable to the observed noise level. Like the Rac\u0142awka and Czatkowice samples, there is no support for the presence of a significant proportion of SP grains that might be associated with chemical remagnetisation (Jackson and Swanson-Hysell, 2012).\n\n\n4.3.2\nDirections\nMost specimens show NRM intensities on the order of 10-100 \u03bcA\/m, but some show intensities up to 1200 \u03bcA\/m, which are generally found in the top parts of the section where there is more variability in initial NRM intensity (see Fig. 5). Although specimens display a wide range of component removal steps, there seems to be no difference in thermal or alternating field demagnetisation behaviours. Sister specimens rarely behave the same. Most specimens show only a very small LT component, which is generally removed around 175\u00b0C or 10 mT (see Fig. 20A), but some specimens are dominated by this component (see Fig. 20B and 20C). The LT component resembles a modern field; with inclinations of around 80\u00b0 (the expected inclination for a modern field is 77\u00b0). A large proportion of the samples (37 specimens) show an ESE, upward-directed (reverse polarity) magnetisation expected for a Carboniferous (~320 Ma) Kiaman magnetisation (using the North American APWP from Torsvik et al. (2012); Fig. 20D-F). HT components observed in the specimens do not cluster, but show a random scatter (see Fig. 20G-J). Equal area plots of all interpreted components are shown in Fig. 21\n. Clustering of directions is also poor in specimen coordinates (see Fig. 21E), indicating that these HT components are unlikely to reflect a measurement artefact.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion of new results\n\n5.1\nBlankenheim, Germany\n\n5.1.1\nAge constraints\nAlthough the base of the Tortodus kockelianus Zone is missing, and it is thus difficult to estimate how much time is represented in the section, an estimate of the maximum time interval represented can be inferred. Absolute durations of individual conodont zones in the Devonian are not rigorously constrained because of the lack of radiometric ages in the Middle Devonian. However, the Tortodus kockelianus Zone has an estimated duration of around 2 Myr (when the Tortodus eiflius zone is included; see Becker et al., 2020) and encompasses the whole Junkerberg Fm. The Blankenheim section, which represents only a portion of the Junkerberg Fm, likely corresponds to at most a few hundred kyr. De Vleeschouwer et al. (2018) describe a sedimentation rate of 3.2 cm\/kyr for the Wetteldorf section, which contains the Emsian-Eifelian boundary and is located ~40 km from the Blankenheim section. While there are large lateral variations in facies in the Eifel Mountains, based on the similar lithology, we estimate that sedimentation rates in the Blankenheim section are of the same order, which would suggest that the Blankenheim section covers ca. 250 kyr.\n\n\n5.1.2\nOrigin of the magnetic signal\n\nK\u00f6nigshof et al. (2016) studied the Blankenheim section using magnetic susceptibility data as a proxy for paleoclimatic changes. To constrain the impact of diagenesis, they used hysteresis data, isothermal remanent magnetization and short-term remanence decay data (K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016). Hysteresis measurements indicate the paramagnetic fraction as the main carrier of the magnetic susceptibility, since the high field susceptibility (\u03c7hf) is well correlated to the total magnetic susceptibility, while the ferrimagnetic susceptibility (\u03c7ferri) is weakly related. The ferrimagnetic minerals are composed of a mixture of low coercivity minerals (such as magnetite) and high coercivity minerals (such as hematite\/goethite, evidenced by the lack of induced remanence saturation at 300 mT). Hysteresis and decay remanence with time both suggest relatively coarse ferrimagnetic grains, along an SD + MD mixing curve of the Day plot (Day et al., 1977). The Rhenohercynian fold and thrust belt, which includes the Blankenheim section, has experienced a large remagnetization event (e.g., Da Silva et al., 2012, 2013; Garza and Zijderveld, 1996; Zegers et al., 2003; Zwing et al., 2005). However, this remagnetization event created new magnetite grains with a SP grain size. In our study, the coarse grain size (SD + MD) as well as the low conodont alteration index (between 1.5 and 2.0), indicates maximum temperatures of remagnetisation of 55\u00b0C (Helsen and K\u00f6nigshof, 1994) that seem to have little to no impact in producing new ferrimagnetic phases. We therefore consider it likely that the NRM is dominantly carried by primary detrital phases, overprinted in many cases entirely by subsequent thermo-viscous remanent magnetisations associated with prolonged exposure to strong geomagnetic fields in the Kiaman superchron and Bruhnes chron. If there are small amounts of SP grains generated by remagnetisation events, these have had limited or no overspill into the stable natural remanence.\n\n\n5.1.3\nInterpretation of the magnetostratigraphy\n\nBecker et al. (2020) used polarity patterns as presented in previous versions of the timescale in their polarity timescale in the GTS2020, but it is unclear which studies these patterns are based on. The polarity is denoted as normal for the early Eifelian in GTS2020, and unknown for the late Eifelian. The Blankenheim section covers part of the late Eifelian. The ChRM directions that we observe could indicate a Devonian reverse polarity, similar to the Devonian direction reported by Zwing and Bachtadse, 2000. We find an average direction of dec = 207.6\u00b0, inc = 34.4\u00b0, \u03b195 = 8.4\u00b0 (direction reported by Zwing and Bachtadse (2000) is dec = 198\u00b0, inc = 40\u00b0, \u03b195 = 4.9\u00b0). However, due to the absence of field tests, we refrain from interpreting our data as primary Devonian directions. Although we consider it unlikely, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that this direction is somehow an unexplained combination of a Kiaman direction and a modern field direction.\n\n\n\n5.2\nRac\u0142awka and Czatkowice, Poland\n\n5.2.1\nAge constraints\nPaszkowski (in Dvor\u00e1k et al., 1995) originally assumed an early to middle Tournaisian age of the Dubie and Rac\u0142awka Formations. According to Wolniewicz (2009), the assemblage of foraminifera found in the G\u00f3ra \u017barska Member of the Dubie Formation indicate the Famennian Quasiendothyra communis\u2013 Quasiendothyra regularis foraminiferal zone, which corresponds to the Upper Palmatolepis marginifera \u2013 Upper Palmatolepis expansa conodont zones (W\u00f3jcik, 2012). A similar assemblage of foraminifera, with Quasiendothyra communis communis and Eoendothyra regularis and no representatives of Q. kobeitusana and Carboniferous tournayellids have been found in the upper part of the Rac\u0142awka Formation within the studied interval during fieldwork in 2016. The early Tournaisian age of the Szklary Formation is suggested based on the presence of a foraminiferal assemblage with Earlandia elegans and Eochernyshinella crassitheca, which corresponds to the Belgian MFZ2 Foraminiferal Zone and Siphonodella belkai conodont zone of the Ural region (B\u0105k et al., 2014; compare to Poty et al., 2007). A Carboniferous (Tournaisian) age was proven also for the Przy Granicy Formation based on conodonts (Appelt, 1998; compare to Gromczakiewicz-\u0141omnicka, 1974). A local hiatus at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary due to the global Hangenberg regression cannot be completely ruled out, as there is no record of uppermost Famennian foraminifera.\nThe exact position of the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary in the Czatkowice Quarry, as well as in the Rac\u0142awka Valley section is still uncertain. However, similar to the Krak\u00f3w platform area, upper Famennian cyclic sequences with oolites and bahamite grainstones were described from Montagne Noire (La Serre section; e.g., Feist et al., 2000) and Aachen-Velbert area sections (Hance and Poty, 2006). These sections contain the same succession of characteristic lithofacies, calcretised and stylolitised subaerial exposure surfaces, transgressive lags and bentonite layers, which are covered by up to 2 m of oolitic-bahamitic grainstone bed (bed no 159 in the Anseremme section) corresponding to the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (Hance and Poty, 2006). The Rhenish Slate Mountains also contain records of oolites above the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary (Becker et al., 2021). The precise lithostratigraphic correlation of the aforementioned sections, as well as identification of the basal Tournaisian boundary in the Czatkowice quarry need further investigation.\n\n\n5.2.2\nOrigin of the magnetic signal\nFurther up in the Czatkowice section than our sampled interval, in the Przy Granicy Formation (late Tournaisian age), Appelt (1998) found Mississippian conodonts with very low CAI values of 1-1.5, similar to the values from the Blankenheim section. Both the Holy Cross Mountains and the Eifel Mountains were part of the Variscan fold belt, and low CAI values can be explained by the lack of deep burial of the Devonian sedimentary rocks. Grabowski and Nawrocki (1996) tentatively suggest that remagnetisation in this area is linked to late Variscan ore mineralisation, while Zwing (2003) mentions a complex remagnetisation history for the Holy Cross Mountains further north. It is unclear whether the ChRM represents a near-depositional magnetisation overprinted with viscous remanent magnetisations (VRMs), or a later chemical remagnetisation related to Variscan ore mineralisation. However, considering the dual polarity obtained from both sections, as well as the good correlation between the two sections based on magnetostratigraphy, we consider the latter unlikely. Regardless, any remagnetisation must have occurred without significantly elevating temperatures, as CAI values are low, and without generating significant quantities of SP\/SD grains, because hysteresis loops are distinct from remagnetised carbonates. It is noteworthy that Ordovician carbonates from the Holy Cross Mountains that have similar CAI as our Devonian rocks are variably overprinted by Kiaman remagnetisations, and show well-resolved normal and reverse Ordovician polarities (Hounslow et al., 2021; Sch\u00e4tz et al., 2006).\n\n\n5.2.3\nInterpretation of the magnetostratigraphy\nOur limited sampling of the Upper Devonian in the Rac\u0142awka and Czatkowice sections has not enabled a comparison with the polarity pattern of the study of Hansma et al. (2015), which covered the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (see Fig. 1). The directions we find in our Polish samples represent both polarities, and results are consistent between the two measured sections, which we can confidently correlate based on the magnetic polarity pattern (thick dashed line in Fig. 17) and biostratigraphy. Liu et al. (1991) find a reverse magnetozone with an overlying normal magnetozone just above the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, and we find a similar relationship (but with different biostratigraphic control). Kolesov (2007) finds a similar Reversed-Normal magnetozone boundary in both the Kamenka section in NE Russia and the Kozhim section in the northern Urals, rather closer to the inferred Devonian-Carboniferous boundary like in our data. These differences are likely explained by imprecision in placement of the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary.\n\n\n\n5.3\nProhibition Creek, Canada\nWe observe three components of magnetisation in the samples from Canada, one resembling a modern field, one resembling a Carboniferous reverse polarity, and one that is scattered and may have no geological significance (see Fig. 21). We thus cannot make an interpretation concerning Devonian directions or polarities from the Canadian samples.\n\n5.3.1\nAge constraints\nThe upper 61 m of the Hume Formation at Prohibition Creek mainly consist of bioclastic mudstone and wackestone with birds-eye fenestral structures and rare macrofossils, and wackestone\/packstone in the uppermost 3 m and lowermost 10 m of the studied interval (Kabanov et al., 2019). Most archival and recent samples taken for conodont biostratigraphy in this part of the Hume Formation were barren, except for a few samples in the wackestone\/packstone beds. Faunas are dominated by icriodid taxa in the lowermost beds and by polygnathid taxa in the uppermost beds. However, the index taxa for the upper Eifelian part of standard conodont zonation, Tortodus kockelianus and Polygnathus ensensis, are not present in the samples. Lithological correlation with the Hume type section, and several other sections representing the Hume Formation in the northern Mackenzie Mountain front (Gouwy, unpublished data; Gouwy and Uyeno, 2018), allows projection of the standard conodont zonation onto the Prohibition Creek section, based on the faunas identified in the different sections. For the T. kockelianus Zone, Polygnathus curtigladius, the local auxiliary taxon used to indicate the base of the zone (Uyeno et al., 2017), is projected onto the Prohibition Creek section at 90 m below the top of the Hume Formation. The kockelianus Zone in the studied interval covers thus roughly two thirds of the entire kockelianus Zone in the section. The index taxon P. ensensis has a delayed first appearance in the lowermost part of the Hare Indian Formation in the Mackenzie Mountains and Mackenzie Valley area. The base of the P. ensensis Zone is indicated by the appearance of the brachiopod Eliorhynchus castanea, index for the castanea brachiopod Zone (Pedder, 2017), whose base coincides with the base of the P. ensensis Zone, in the Hume type section, and is projected at 2.5 m below the top of the Hume Formation in the studied section. Based on the conodont zones identified in the section and the estimated 2 Myr duration of the kockelianus Zone (when the eiflius zone is included; Becker et al., 2020), the studied interval represents roughly 1.3 Myr.\n\n\n5.3.2\nOrigin of the magnetic signal\nThe observed low temperature component is likely a VRM acquired during the Bruhnes chron. The reverse polarity component could represent either a thermoviscous remanent magnetisation (TVRM; e.g., Kent, 1985), or a chemical remanent magnetisation (CRM) acquired during the Kiaman superchron. Since this component does not converge towards the origin, and the rock magnetic results do not indicate introduction of new magnetic minerals, we tentatively conclude that this component represents a TVRM. We hypothesise that the remaining high-temperature component could represent a primary (post-) detrital remanent magnetisation reflecting a chaotic magnetic vector from the time of deposition, or could be meaningless, but we currently cannot conclusively choose between either of these two.\n\n\n\n5.4\nSummary of new results\nOur new results are of varying quality. The results from the sections that we have measured in Germany and Canada yield problematic paleomagnetic results. The samples from the Blankenheim section show either only a Devonian reverse polarity (see Fig. 9), or represent a direction that is a mixture between the Kiaman field and a modern field, but we cannot presently distinguish between these two, due to the lack of field tests. Samples from Canada show three types of directions: components likely resembling a modern field direction, components resembling a Carboniferous Kiaman direction, and unknown components that show extremely large scatter (see Fig. 21). The Polish sections, however, seem to produce reliable directions in some specimens.\nResults from the Polish sections can be compared to literature poles from Devonian sedimentary rocks from the Holy Cross Mountains. Grabowski and Nawrocki (2001) found seven groups of data, of which four are located on a great-circle (Fig. 22\n). The authors discuss in detail how their data might be explained, but do not provide an all-encompassing solution, and conclude that a definite tectonic interpretation is not possible. They discuss the necessity for some poles to be the result of remagnetisation, as they were derived from limestones with high CAI and\/or show secondary dolomitisation. However, explaining all results would require large vertical-axis tectonic rotations that are not in agreement with structural observations in the area. Another hypothesis considered was strain modification of magnetic minerals, which however disagreed with their AMS (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility) results. Our Devonian normal polarity average (dec = 41.2\u00b0, inc = -35.1\u00b0) falls between two of their directions (denoted DO and JO; Grabowski and Nawrocki, 2001) and lies along the great-circle that Grabowski and Nawrocki (2001) describe (see Fig. 22). Our Devonian reverse polarity average (dec = 237.9\u00b0, inc = 49.9\u00b0) does not compare to any of their results. Thus, while we conclude that the new paleomagnetic directions obtained from our Polish sections probably represent reliable Devonian field directions, rocks from this area collectively present a puzzling record of the magnetic field.\nOne of the common observations from Devonian paleomagnetic results is that the rocks have suffered from widespread remagnetisation, mostly during the Kiaman reverse superchron (e.g., North America: Irving and Strong, 1985, Irving and Strong, 1984; Mac Niocaill and Smethurst, 1994; McCabe and Elmore, 1989; Belgium: Garza and Zijderveld, 1996; Zegers et al., 2003; Ukraine: Jele\u0144ska et al., 2015; Smethurst and Khramov, 1992; Poland: Kadzia\u0142ko-Hofmokl et al., 1999; Nawrocki, 1993; Algeria: A\u00effa, 1993; Mauritania: Kent et al., 1984; Germany: Zwing and Bachtadse, 2000; Australia: Schmidt et al., 1986; Ireland: Pastor-Gal\u00e1n et al., 2015; Urals: Iosifidi and Khramov, 2013). However, one important question remains unresolved: how can rocks record an overprint when the conditions for overprinting are barely met? K\u00f6nigshof et al. (2016) provide detailed rock magnetic studies on samples of the Blankenheim section, and indicate that thermally-related alteration appears to be very weak, based on thin-sections and preservation of fossils. Conodont alteration index values indicate that the succession in the Blankenheim section was subjected to maximum temperatures of around 55 \u00b0C, which are unlikely to cause significant thermal-overprinting (e.g., Pullaiah et al., 1975). Furthermore, K\u00f6nigshof et al. (2016) argue that superparamagnetic grains, which they expect in remagnetised samples, are not very common. The grain size of the magnetite grains in the Blankenheim section is in favour of a detrital origin (K\u00f6nigshof et al., 2016). So, while conditions for the probable preservation of a primary Devonian paleomagnetic signal have been met, our directional results show a pervasive partial Kiaman overprint. In order to gain a broader insight into the Devonian geomagnetic field we turn to reviewing the global dataset of published paleomagnetic measurements.\n\n\n\n6\nReview of Devonian paleomagnetic studies\n\n6.1\nMagnetostratigraphy of the Devonian\nThe geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) is heavily reliant on marine magnetic anomalies which are preserved in oceanic crust until the Middle Jurassic. However, due to subduction of oceanic plates, a GPTS for the Early Jurassic and older must instead be derived from records obtained from outcrops or drill cores. For the Triassic, a lot of progress has been made in the last few years (e.g., Kent et al., 2019; Maron et al., 2019). The Early Permian and Pennsylvanian are dominated by predominantly reverse polarity of the Kiaman superchron (e.g., Hounslow and Balabanov, 2018), while the somewhat limited data for the Mississippian indicate mixed polarity (Hounslow, 2021). Constraining the GPTS and reversal frequency for the Devonian to Carboniferous is crucial for understanding the behaviour of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The Earth\u2019s magnetic field is hypothesised to have a \u2018heartbeat\u2019, of varying average reversal frequency and intensity, with a periodicity of about 200 million years (e.g., Pavlov and Gallet, 2005). A strong magnetic field is generally associated with magnetic superchrons, such as the Cretaceous normal superchron (e.g., Tarduno et al., 2002). These are intervals of millions of years in which the magnetic field is extremely stable and there are no (or very few) reversals of the geomagnetic field. On the other hand, a weak field is commonly associated with frequent reversals, such as the middle-late Jurassic hyperactivity (e.g., Kulakov et al., 2019). Changes in the strength of the field and the reversal frequency are thought to be driven by changes in heat flow across the core-mantle boundary, which may in turn be linked to supercontinent cycles and subduction flux (Hounslow et al., 2018). This 200 Myr periodicity hypothesis relies on the behaviour of the magnetic field during the Devonian (420-360 Ma). The \u2018heartbeat\u2019 hypothesis predicts a weak field for this time, with a high reversal frequency.\nConstruction of a GPTS for the Paleozoic requires a careful inspection of Devonian magnetostratigraphy. In Fig. 1, we give an overview of the polarity patterns that were provided for the Devonian in the most recent versions of the geologic time scale (GTS; 2020, 2016, 2012 and 2004). In Becker et al. (2020), the polarity pattern in the Devonian is taken from the 2012 version (Becker et al., 2012), with an additional polarity pattern obtained from the Canning Basin in Australia by Hansma et al. (2015). A prior version of the timescale (Ogg et al., 2016a) shows conflicting polarity patterns around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. Ogg et al. (2016a), in their chapter on the Devonian, put the boundary in an interval of unknown polarity, while in the chapter on the Carboniferous, Ogg et al. (2016b) put the Devonian-Carboniferous in a reverse polarity interval. These inconsistencies are largely inherited from older versions of the timescale, as the patterns of Becker et al. (2012) differ from the patterns of Davydov et al. (2012). However, the most problematic issue with the Devonian polarity patterns as presented in the GPTS is that it is unclear what data they are based on. Clues to the origins of these polarity patterns are the Russian hyperchron names such as \u2018Sayan hyperchron\u2019, \u2018Donetzian mixed polarity hyperchron\u2019, which indicates that these geomagnetic polarity intervals largely have their origins in the Russian \u2018general stratigraphic scale\u2019 (Guzhikov, 2019; Khramov and Shkatova, 2000), first created by Khramov and Rodionov (1980), which is in part based on non-magnetostratigraphic data. In this \u2018general stratigraphic scale\u2019, it is unclear which datasets of have suffered from remagnetisation, and which data were included into the GPTS (see discussion in Guzhikov, 2019). The review of Carboniferous polarity by Hounslow et al. (2021) has largely dispensed with these older uncertain datasets. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the Russian Devonian timescales of Kolesov (2005) and Khramov and Shkatova (2000) are incompatible with the GPTS of 2004, 2012 and 2016.\nThe only well-documented studies of Devonian magnetostratigraphy are from Frasnian-Famennian (Late Devonian) carbonates in the Canning Basin in Australia (Green et al., 2021; Hansma et al., 2015). All other studies that provide magnetic polarity patterns (e.g., Kolesov, 2007; Kolesov, 2005; Kolesov, 1984) do not show the data on which they are based, preventing the quality of the magnetostratigraphic data to be assessed. Sampling strategies for constructing a magnetostratigraphy are very different from paleopole type studies. Studies aimed at reconstruction of poles generally collect \u22655 samples per site, and sites are typically not uniformly distributed through rock successions. In contrast, for magnetostratigraphic studies sampling ideally consists of closely-spaced, evenly distributed samples with respect to stratigraphic height. The large magnetostratigraphic study by Hansma et al. (2015) used almost 900 samples, and was performed on rocks which were challenging due to weak magnetisations. Hansma et al. compared their data with previous studies on the same sections (Chen et al., 1995; Hurley and Van Der Voo, 1987), and reported that their new data clustered in the southwestern quadrant of the stereonet, in agreement with the poles of the previous studies. However, Hansma et al. applied a 45\u00b0 cut-off centred on the mean of the prior poles, which eliminated nearly half of their data points (45% of Oscar range data and 40% of Horse spring data). Applying this process, Hansma et al. reported a field that is moderately rapidly reversing (reversal frequency is on the same order as during the Paleogene, ca. 2 reversals per Myr) even when omitting magnetozones based on a single sample. However, the correlation of the magnetozones between their two time-equivalent sections is rather ambiguous and their untreated data is near randomly distributed on a sphere (see Fig. 23\n). The more recent study of Green et al. (2021) on carbonates from a drill core in the Canning Basin shows very similar findings. The conglomerate test of Heslop and Roberts (2018) indicates strong support for a uniform distribution of these directions. Clearly, applying a 45\u00b0 cut-off on a near-uniform distribution of directions that are randomly ordered with respect to stratigraphic height will produce a conclusion of a rapidly reversing field. The creation of a robust magnetostratigraphy from these results is therefore in doubt, unless it can be corroborated, and we suggest that inclusion of the inferred magnetozones in any GPTS is unwise.\n\n\n6.2\nTectonic paleomagnetic studies of the Devonian\nSince the early days of paleomagnetic study, it has been a struggle to reconstruct Devonian plate tectonics using paleopole datasets (e.g., Livermore et al., 1985). Plate reconstructions based on paleomagnetism have been shown to be challenging to match with climate belts and lithologic indicators of paleolatitude, notably with Russian gypsiferous sediments in the Late Devonian (Khramov, 1967; Witzke, 1990; Witzke and Heckel, 1988). Evans (2006) looked at the geographic distribution of evaporites and surmised that Devonian and Ediacaran evaporites show an anomalous distribution compared to Cenozoic-Carboniferous evaporites when using paleopoles to infer paleolatitudes. For many plates, reliable Devonian poles are lacking. We focus our review here on the poles that were used for construction of global apparent polar wander paths, which are constructed based on paleomagnetic poles from the large continents. The discussion below is incomplete with respect to poles from smaller plates and complex tectonic settings. We provide an overview of all the paleomagnetic studies on Devonian rocks studies that we assessed in an extended bibliography (supplementary file S8). More than 40 years ago, Morel and Irving (1978) suggested that reliable plate tectonic reconstructions can be made from the middle Carboniferous onwards, whereas for the Devonian, reconstructions are poorly constrained due to the scarcity of results (on average ~8 paleomagnetic results per 10 Myr, compared to an average of ~20 for Carboniferous and later times; Morel and Irving, 1978). Morel and Irving (1978) introduced two apparent polar wander paths, based on the inclusion or exclusion of paleomagnetic data obtained from Australia, based on a total number of 56 paleopoles. They show an X-path, which is relatively straight, and a Y-path, which has a large loop (see discussion in V\u00e9rard, 2004). The Y-path results in drift rates for plates that are 40-60 cm\/yr. (V\u00e9rard, 2004), rates which are above the hypothesised maximum speed at which plates tend to move (Conrad and Hager, 1999; Meert et al., 1993; Zahirovic et al., 2015). We note here the similarity of Devonian paleomagnetic results to those of the Ediacaran, a time period for which complex paleomagnetic data would also result in anomalously high plate speeds (e.g., Abrajevitch and Van der Voo, 2010).\n\nCocks and Torsvik (2002) provide a review of paleopole data and fauna from 500-400 Ma and conclude that the reliability of paleopole data decreases into the Devonian. Also Torsvik et al. (2012) note that data is truly scarce from the Middle Devonian to the Mississippian. Fig. 24\n shows the number of poles in the APWP of Torsvik et al. (2012), which highlights that there has been little progress in improving the scarcity of Devonian paleopole data since 1978. Cocks and Torsvik (2007) highlighted that between the Llandovery (early Silurian) and latest Permian, there are only two reliable poles for the reconstruction of Siberia and Baltica. One has an age of around 360 Ma, close to the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, and the other one an age of 275 Ma, (late early Permian). Bachtadse and Briden (1990) indicate that the Devonian is the most problematic segment of the Gondwana APWP and Torsvik et al. (2012) show that data coverage is especially poor for Laurentia between 400-340 Ma and that paleopoles for 260-350 Ma and 390-380 Ma are instead interpolated. This interpolation results in the so-called \u2018Siluro-Devonian cusp\u2019 (Torsvik et al., 2012), which has been interpreted as an episode of extreme true polar wander (e.g., Piper, 2006; van der Voo, 1994). In short, there is an agreement that plate tectonic reconstructions in the Devonian suffer from a severe scarcity of high-quality paleopole data.\nIn assessing the quality of paleopoles, a common approach is to classify the poles based on the reliability criteria of Van der Voo (1990), a widely accepted approach to filter-out older studies based on inadequate demagnetisation techniques. The Van der Voo criteria are used to quantitatively assess the quality of paleomagnetic poles and for each of the 7 Q-criteria, the palaeopole gets 1 point. Commonly only poles that have a minimum value of Q=3 are taken into account for construction of apparent polar wander paths. The minimum criteria (Q=3) state that the rocks must (1) have a well-determined age and presumption that the magnetisation is of the same age, (2) give results that are based on a sufficient number of samples and (3) be from rocks that were adequately demagnetised. Reliability can be further increased by field tests that constrain the age of magnetisation, structural controls are provided, reversals are observed, and there is no resemblance to paleopoles of a younger age. Algeo (1996) used 35 poles obtained from Devonian rocks to assess polarity bias in the Devonian, with each of these passing a number of quality criteria of Van der Voo (1990). Similarly, Mac Niocaill and Smethurst (1994) use 11 poles for the reconstruction of the APWP of Laurentia. Torsvik et al. (2012) used 18 Devonian paleopoles for the construction of the GAPWaP (see Fig. 24), with many having a high Q-index, up to the maximum of 7 using the Van der Voo (1990) criteria. As discussed below, however, problems still remain with Devonian paleopoles even if they have a high Q-index, indicating that scarcity of paleomagnetic data for the Devonian has not yet been solved by using modern techniques.\nFor the Australian part of East Gondwana, for example, Torsvik et al. (2012) include four poles. Three of these poles are from the Canning Basin and are obtained from the same, or time-equivalent formations (Chen et al., 1995; Hurley and Van Der Voo, 1987). The 4th pole is cited as \u2018E. Tohver, pers. comm. (2012)\u2019, which we assume was subsequently published as Hansma et al. (2015). Arguably, these three poles all form just one pole, as they were obtained from the same rocks. That is, if these data should be taken into account at all, as we discussed previously the problems with the Hansma et al. (2015) data. The Chen et al. (1993) paleopole for the Australian APWP cannot be reconciled with the data from Africa by Bachtadse and Briden (1991), while both of these studies are included in the GAPWaP. The only pole taken into account for the western Gondwana APWP is from the Bokkeveld Group in South Africa from the study of Bachtadse et al. (1987). However, Bachtadse and Briden (1990) do not consider data from Bokkeveld Group as meeting the requirements for a key pole due to \u2018complicated rock-magnetic behaviour\u2019. We do not seek to discredit the Devonian portions of APWPs, but highlight these issues to show that upon closer inspection nearly all Devonian paleomagnetic data are problematic. It is noteworthy that the problematic pole from the Canning basin (E. Tohver, pers. comm., 2012) is the only study in the Devonian part of the GAPWaP of Torsvik et al. (2012) that was published in the last 25 years. This brings to light an important challenge in paleomagnetism; namely that there are few robust studies using modern methods that aim to construct paleopoles from the large stable continents, while the global apparent polar wander path for the last 500 million years is by no means complete.\nFor the Devonian, a perverse impression arises; the smaller a dataset is, the more likely it is to provide acceptable results. Larger datasets often show results that are problematic, as they may show groups of directions that either cannot be explained, or have resulted in competing explanations involving large tectonic rotations, extreme plate speeds, or episodes of true polar wander (e.g., Lewandowski, 1995; Nawrocki, 1995). When sample size is increased, the risk of obtaining (groups of) complicated directions that cannot be reconciled with other data increases. This can be seen for example in the study of Bazhenov et al. (2013) who extended the sampling of Levashova et al. (2007). Levashova et al. (2007) report a succession of lava flows exhibiting secular variation (which describes the changes in the magnetic field on timescales of typically several tens of thousands of years or less) consistent with the predominantly GAD field during most of the Cenozoic. However, the extended sampling of Bazhenov et al. (2013) reveals lava flows where the magnitude of secular variation is substantially greater than previously reported. Bazhenov et al. (2013) find that the directions from part of their lava succession shows secular variation that is several times greater than in another part. Other examples include Hawkins et al. (2019), who used the directions of Kravchinsky et al. (2002), but also show additional directions that were not published in the original study. A similar situation is observed for the Cheviot Hills lavas in the north of England, where Hawkins (2018) shows more directional groups than the original study of Thorning (1974), which is included in the APWP of Torsvik et al. (2012). Grabowski and Nawrocki (2001) find several directional groups in middle to upper Devonian sediments from Poland, which cannot all simultaneously be explained (see also Fig. 22). Sallomy and Piper (1973) describe a distribution of directions that is not simply antipodal. They find two groups that they interpret as normal and reverse polarity, then sites classed as groups A and B, and then nine further \u2018unclassified\u2019 sites. The directions from the Sallomy and Piper (1973) study were reanalysed by Shatsillo and Pavlov (2019), who interpret them as due to non-dipolar behaviour of the field during the Devonian.\nDirectional groups are common in volcanic successions (e.g., Knight et al., 2004; Van Der Boon et al., 2017), as volcanic rocks are formed rapidly, and may not average out secular variation. If directional groups are also observed in sedimentary rocks, as the study of Grabowski and Nawrocki (2001) seems to suggest, this likely indicates that the field stayed in a stable configuration for a long time while detrital remanence magnetisation was locked in. Martin (1975) hypothesised that the interval in their study on Middle Devonian limestone sampled a normal polarity interval, a reverse polarity interval, and a transitional interval in which the field reverses polarity, and secular variation might not be averaged out. Considering the relatively slow sedimentation rates for limestones, this is an unusual conclusion. The normal and reverse polarities of Martin (1975) are furthermore not antipodal. Directional groups and extreme scatter that are seen in these studies are difficult to explain by remagnetisation (e.g., L\u00f8vlie et al., 1984), which would have likely led to more consistent directions since the presumed remagnetising conditions would have occurred simultaneously across all sites.\nIn summary, the APWPs for continental plates in the Devonian rely on sparse data, for which palaeopole quality is hard to assess due to the absence of supplementary data. The number of paleopoles that are considered reliable has decreased since the 1970\u2019s (e.g., Mac Niocaill and Smethurst, 1994; Morel and Irving, 1978; Torsvik et al., 2012). The general characteristics that arise from Devonian data are that studies have often found several groups of directions that cannot all be simultaneously explained, or the scatter in directions is extremely large, so directional averaging is unwarranted. Due to the positive-outcome bias that exists in most fields of science (e.g., Fanelli, 2012), one wonders whether this data scarcity from Devonian paleomagnetic studies is due to many more non-positive results. As there have clearly been many studies done on Devonian paleomagnetism, we do not consider it likely that scarce results are due to a lack of study of Devonian paleomagnetism. Furthermore, extensive rock magnetic studies may be required by reviewers to supplement datasets (e.g., this study, Bazhenov et al., 2013), or the results are too complex to interpret and authors might refrain from publishing their Devonian datasets (e.g., Powerman et al., 2013).\n\n\n6.3\nStudies of geomagnetic field behaviour\nAbsolute paleointensity studies typically provide snapshots of the strength of the magnetic field, so obtaining a comprehensive paleointensity record throughout the Devonian requires many studies. Paleointensity data spanning the interval 200-500 Ma have recently been reassessed using the Quality of Paleointensity (QPI) framework (Biggin and Paterson, 2014) by Hawkins et al. (2021) and Bono et al. (2022). Since Sallomy and Piper (1973), the Devonian field has been suggested to have a strength that was an order of magnitude lower than the modern field. Subsequent paleointensity studies from Devonian volcanic rocks have supported this conclusion, revealing a weak to very weak field (e.g., Briden, 1966; Didenko and Pechersky, 1989). Until recently, many measurements of Palaeozoic paleointensity were acquired using techniques that are not considered to meet modern standards of reliability. Several recent studies (Hawkins et al., 2021; Hawkins et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2021; Shcherbakova et al., 2017) have, however, confirmed the central observation - the field in the Devonian and early Carboniferous was unusually weak compared to any subsequent period. Hawkins et al. (2021) found that paleointensities show an extremely weak magnetic field in the Devonian, with some outliers during the Early Devonian (around 400 Ma), a time interval for which there are both weak and strong paleointensity results. It is possible that the field dropped in strength from weak in the Early Devonian to extremely weak in the Middle and Late Devonian, but many more paleointensity data are needed to verify this.\n\nBono et al. (2022) use the PINT v8.0.0 database to determine a long-term median dipole moment of 48 ZAm2, averaging the past 4 billion years. The modern field is stronger, around 80 ZAm2 (Th\u00e9bault et al., 2015). The field in the Devonian is thus much weaker (Hawkins et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2017), with a median value of 17 ZAm2 (Hawkins et al., 2021). Hawkins et al. (2021) suggest this low field interval extended for at least 80 Myr, from the Early Devonian into the early Carboniferous and named it the Mid-Palaeozoic Dipole Low.\nHere we investigate whether the time-averaged strength of the magnetic field changed during the Devonian. Robust estimates of the paleofield are challenging to obtain for rocks of any age due to the ubiquitous presence of non-ideal magnetic recorders which are prone to laboratory-induced alteration. Typical paleointensity studies have a success rate of \u223c20%; this effect is further complicated by two additional factors (Tauxe and Yamazaki, 2007). Firstly, early paleomagnetic techniques had variable capability for recognizing spurious magnetizations, but community standards on data reporting have since evolved to include metrics on data quality. Thus, early studies require careful inspection and\/or removal from analyses if unsuitable measurements are recognized (Biggin and Paterson, 2014). Secondly, large (i.e., multidomain) magnetic grains can represent a substantial fraction of the remanence magnetization in some rocks. Multidomain grains have geologically short magnetic relaxation times (<<100 Myr; Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997), and while these rocks may be suitable for paleodirection\/magnetostratigraphic studies, such samples can yield unreliable paleointensities in older geologic materials. For these reasons, careful selection criteria must be balanced with the desire to maximize the quantity of data included in a description of long-term field behaviour. Hawkins et al. (2021) and Bono et al. (2022) compiled and analysed a dataset of field strength estimates for the Devonian and assessed the reliability of paleointensity data using the QPI (Biggin and Paterson, 2014) approach. Using a combination of the PINT database (Bono et al., 2022), with Shcherbakova et al. (2021) and paleointensity data from Hawkins et al. (2021), we selected sites which met the following criteria for our analysis: 1) directions were not identified as transitional in polarity by authors of the study, 2) there are at least three intensity determinations per site, and 3) site data are of reasonable quality (total QPI \u2265 3). Virtual dipole moments were determined using published inclination and paleointensity data; if inclination data were not available (14\/120 sites), a virtual axial dipole moment was determined assuming a site latitude of 30.6\u00b0 (which yields a dipole moment halfway between an equatorial and polar site latitude). Here, paleointensity sites are from volcanic cooling units recording \"instantaneous\" snapshots of the field. Selected data were grouped into 1 Myr bins to produce time-averaged estimates; only bins which contained more than one site were considered for characterizing the trend (see Fig. 25\n). Different selection criteria were explored (either a stricter one requiring QPI criteria AGE+MD+ALT+DIR to have passed, number of intensity determinations \u2265 3, and number of sites per bin \u2265 3, or a more relaxed one accepting any non-transitional paleointensity sites with at least 3 determinations and bins with only one site). These alternate selection criteria do not substantially change the broad interpretation of a very weak field during the Middle to Late Devonian. However, the stricter selection criteria may address a potential suspicion of a low-field bias (Smirnov et al., 2017) by only selecting sites where magnetizations carried by non-ideal multidomain carriers are removed prior to the paleointensity experiment.\nOrganizing the data in this fashion suggests a geomagnetic field that was somewhat weaker than the Phanerozoic average during the Early Devonian and steadily weakened during the Middle Devonian, reaching a minimum by 380 Ma (Late Devonian). This interval of extremely weak field appears to have lasted for \u223c40\u221280 Myr, although constraining the duration is hampered by the lack of sufficiently high quality paleointensity data for the 340-360 Ma interval. By the onset of the Kiaman Superchron (see Fig. 25) at ca. 315 Ma, the field strength had recovered to reach or exceed the Phanerozoic mean field.\nTwo other aspects of long-term field behaviour that can be assessed using paleomagnetic records are average polarity reversal frequency (e.g., Biggin et al., 2012) and paleosecular variation (e.g., Doubrovine et al., 2019). Hansma et al. (2015) claimed to observe a minimum 44 reversals during the late Devonian (a ~24 Myr interval) translating to a reversal frequency of ~2 Myr-1. However, the unusual treatment of data applied to a uniformly distributed dataset (see Section 6.1) raises serious questions over the validity of this reversal record. Bazhenov et al. (2013) also reported unusual paleosecular variation behaviour in a study of lavas in Kazakhstan (see Section 6.2). As noted, secular variation appears to have been enhanced for at least part of the Late Devonian. High scatter of directions caused by secular variation, if confirmed, would suggest a reduced role of the axial dipole in the morphology of the Late Devonian field (Biggin et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n7\nExplanations for suboptimal paleomagnetic results from Devonian rocks\nA wide-ranging review of Devonian paleomagnetism has highlighted that there is a global paucity of published paleomagnetic studies in this period. Most paleomagnetic studies on Devonian rocks are decades old and may not contain the data detail and scientific rigour that is typically expected of contemporary studies. Where recent studies have been published (e.g., Green et al., 2021; Hansma et al., 2015; Hawkins, 2018; Hawkins et al., 2019; Shatsillo and Pavlov, 2019), the data tend to represent paleomagnetic directions that are more scattered than usual, in some cases to an extreme extent. We consider below different reasons for why the Devonian paleomagnetic results may be odd.\n\n7.1\nWeak magnetisations\nThe lack of reliable paleomagnetic data for the Devonian has long been implicitly assumed as a possible indicator for a weak magnetic field, and this has been confirmed by modern studies of paleointensity. A weak magnetic field (Hawkins et al., 2021, Hawkins et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2021, Shcherbakova et al., 2017) will have led to weakly magnetised rocks, which enhance the risk of remagnetisation after the Devonian, in times when the field was stronger. Weak magnetisations also increase the difficulty of obtaining primary paleomagnetic data from sediments due to magnetometer sensitivity limits. Indeed, Devonian rocks classically have extremely weak magnetisations, which often makes exhaustive quantitative analysis challenging. The Devonian has partly acquired a bad reputation for paleomagnetic studies due to studies from the 1960\u2019s when equipment was much less sensitive than today. However, even now with very sensitive magnetometers, measuring Devonian carbonates is still a big challenge, as we have found. Jele\u0144ska et al. (2015) also reported very weak NRM intensities which hampered measurements and interpretation. NRM intensities for Devonian rocks are generally in the range of 10-3 A\/m or below. Although sediments in general have weaker magnetisations than igneous rocks, with values down to 10-6 A\/m (e.g., Claesson, 1979; Kadzia\u0142ko-Hofmokl et al., 1999; Kent, 1979), there are studies that report very weak NRM intensities for Devonian igneous rocks, with values in the range of 10-4-10-5 A\/m (e.g., Hargraves et al., 1987; Jele\u0144ska et al., 1995; Sallomy and Piper, 1973). Normally, NRM intensities of igneous rocks are much higher, in the range of 0.1-10 A\/m (e.g. Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997). Considering the linear relationship between the field and magnetisation (e.g., Dunlop, 2011), and the field in the Devonian likely being at most around 10 times weaker than the modern field, a weak field is likely not the sole explanation for weakly magnetised basalts, and other hypotheses may need to be developed to fully explain weak magnetisations in Devonian volcanic rocks.\n\n\n7.2\nRemagnetisation\nIn Devonian rocks, remagnetisations acquired during recent times and during the Kiaman Superchron are common. Therefore, remagnetisations certainly contribute to the difficulty in obtaining good paleomagnetic data. There was of course ample time and opportunity for remagnetisation after the Devonian. Geodynamo models suggest that during superchrons, the field is strong (e.g., Driscoll and Olson, 2011) and most estimates (but not all; Garcia et al., 2006) from the Kiaman support this (Hawkins et al., 2021). Mountain building in the late Carboniferous-early Permian provided excellent remagnetisation conditions, and many consider that recovering primary Devonian magnetisations is troubling due to remagnetisation during the Kiaman superchron (McCabe and Elmore, 1989; Perrin and Pr\u00e9vot, 1988; Shatsillo and Pavlov, 2019; Thominski et al., 1993; Zwing, 2003). While there is an abundance of studies that explored remagnetisation issues of Devonian rocks, understanding of the mechanisms and imaging of the grains responsible for the remagnetisation remains limited (for extensive reviews of remagnetisation mechanisms of (Devonian) rocks, we refer to Elmore et al. (2012) and Van der Voo and Torsvik (2012)). Zwing (2003) suggests that almost 90% of overprints in late Paleozoic rocks have a reverse polarity, and two thirds are remagnetised between 350 and 250 Ma, which corresponds well with the Kiaman overprints in our samples. Remagnetisation has been linked to four possible origins, 1) heating and associated enhanced thermal remanent and thermoviscous remanent magnetisations (TRMs and TVRMs; Middleton and Schmidt, 1982); 2) smectite-illite transformation during burial (Katz et al., 1998); 3) fluid-related mineralisation in permeable units, 4) diagenetic-related production of new magnetic Fe-phases (Roberts, 2015), or a combination of these (e.g., Minguez et al., 2016). Thermally controlled overprints (causes # 1 and 2) are relatively easy to assess (e.g., Middleton and Schmidt, 1982), because estimates for maximum temperatures can be determined using conodont alteration indices (CAI) and vitrinite reflectance (Rmax) data. When CAI values show that rocks have not been significantly heated, it is commonly inferred that Kiaman remagnetisations must thus have occurred through chemical-mineralogical remagnetisation processes (CRMs, causes # 3 and 4). CRMs are often inferred to be related to processes that drive fluids going through rocks. These hypotheses of chemical remagnetisation of Devonian rocks are often inferred based on the lack of evidence for thermally controlled overprints. In light of common problems of chemical remagnetisation, it is remarkable that Devonian rocks are considered suitable for cyclostratigraphy based on rock magnetic data or magnetic susceptibility (Crick et al., 2001; Crick et al., 1997; Da Silva et al., 2016; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2017; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2015; Ellwood et al., 1999; Garc\u00eda-Alcalde et al., 2012), while yielding no primary paleomagnetic directions because of inferred chemical remagnetisation (Courtillot et al., 1986; Weil and Van der Voo, 2002; Zegers et al., 2003; Zwing, 2003). The so-called \u2018squeegee model\u2019 (Oliver, 1992) has been invoked to explain widespread remagnetisations of Devonian rocks in North America that have only been heated to low temperatures (< 150\u00b0C). The squeegee model infers the existence of cold orogenic fluids at distances very far away from the mountain building front in the Appalachians. However, some studies have had difficulty tying remagnetisation to orogenic fluids. For example Elmore et al. (2001) show two remagnetised formations in a single section, one formation consisting of sandstones, the other formation consisting of limestones. While they found evidence for fluid flow through the sandstones, there was no evidence for fluid-flow related alteration related in the limestones, with obtained Sr isotope ratios in the limestones corresponding to Devonian seawater values. Elmore et al. (2001) concluded that a connection between driven-fluid mineralisation and pervasive overprints is circumstantial. For the Rhenish Massif, Zwing (2003) discarded the possibility that Devonian rocks were remagnetised by regional migration of orogenic fluids. Zwing (2003) observed remagnetisation related to pyrite alteration to magnetite, which they hypothesised to be related to pore fluids or movement of fluids along fractures and faults. In the Middle Devonian of the Rhenish Massif, Zwing concluded that a different mechanism must be responsible for remagnetisation, perhaps related to pressure solution. Shatsillo and Pavlov (2019) further outline problems with overprinting in detail, and our new data also shows that, even when rocks are not expected to have been overprint by the usual processes (significant heating\/burial or remineralisation), Devonian rocks do not show straightforward paleomagnetic directions. Furthermore, the concern of remagnetisation also holds true for older time periods. Prior to the Devonian, however, many paleomagnetic data exist that are considered reliable, even for regions where the Devonian rocks show only remagnetised directions (e.g., Montagne Noire; Nys\u00e6ther et al., 2002, Bohemian Massif; Zwing, 2003) and periods where the field was reportedly hyperreversing, such as the Middle Cambrian (e.g., Gallet et al., 2019), or the Ediacaran (Bazhenov et al., 2016; Kodama, 2021). It is striking that there are more accepted paleomagnetic data from the Ediacaran, as the field in the Ediacaran was likely as weak as, or weaker than in the Devonian (Bono et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2020; Thallner et al., 2021). This poses the question: was the field in the Devonian of a different character than the field in the Ediacaran?\n\n\n7.3\nA non-GAD field\nThe approach of Hansma et al. (2015) to define magnetic polarity, using a 45\u00b0 cut-off on VGP latitude, implicitly assumes that the field is a dipole, approximately aligned with Earth\u2019s rotation axis (GAD field). Any fixed cut-off approach assumes that the field is a relatively stable dipole and spends little time in transitional directions, since these are eliminated by the cut-off (e.g., Cromwell et al., 2018). As nearly half of the data are excluded based on the 45\u00b0 cut-off in the study of Hansma et al. (2015), if their data truly represent the Devonian magnetic field, the stable GAD hypothesis is not suitable to describe the Devonian magnetic field. Shatsillo and Pavlov (2019) have argued for a significant contribution of an equatorial dipole to the Devonian magnetic field. The assumption that the time-averaged field coincides with a stable GAD underpins all plate tectonic reconstructions. Thus, if the field in the Devonian is indeed different from, this may explain paleopole studies that have resulted in conflicting X- and Y-paths (Morel and Irving, 1978).\n\n\n7.4\nSummary\nThe high Q-scores for Devonian paleomagnetic data in the GAPWaP indicate that the scarcity of reliable Devonian data is not purely a problem of widespread remagnetisation. As our newly obtained data show, rocks that are well qualified to have reliably recorded the magnetic field at time of formation often give ambiguous results, and obtaining accurate paleomagnetic data even from \u2018good\u2019 rocks is challenging. We interpret this to be an indication of a non-uniformitarian nature of the geomagnetic field during the Devonian, and not solely an intrinsic problem of the rocks\u2019 history of overprinting. It is striking that few studies show unambiguous Devonian paleomagnetic results, although we note that it is often difficult to judge the quality of the data, as many of the studies are some 25-60 years old, and supplementary data is generally absent.\nSeveral studies have suggested that the field during the Devonian was different from the modern geomagnetic field (e.g., Hawkins et al., 2019; Shatsillo and Pavlov, 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2021; Shcherbakova et al., 2017). These datasets were all obtained from volcanic rocks, which have TRMs, that are normally stronger than the detrital and post-depositional remanent magnetisations (DRMs and PDRMs) in sedimentary rocks that magnetostratigraphy relies on. Shatsillo and Pavlov (2019) argue that mean directions in the Early and Middle Devonian are not bimodal and antipodal, as expected from a GAD field, but show different clusters. Sedimentary rocks tend to average out paleosecular variation, while rapidly cooled volcanic rocks do not. Thus, the effect in sedimentary rocks (as well as in slow-cooling intrusive rocks) might be that several directional sets are contained within a single sample, and the directions compare poorly to those obtained from volcanic rocks. Shatsillo and Pavlov (2019) argue that the results of Piper (2007) from intrusive rocks were not caused by true polar wander, as argued for by Piper, but rather due to multiple composite directions caused by slow cooling.\nIf the Devonian geomagnetic field was truly weak or non-uniformitarian, the paleomagnetic community needs to reconsider which results are \u2018negative\u2019. We emphasise the need for more studies and encourage scientists to publish their Devonian paleomagnetic results even if they are complex or appear unreliable. We also stress the risk associated with over-interpreting results and invoking peculiar regional tectonics or significant episodes of true polar wander, as it can be complicated afterwards to assess the data underlying these explanations. We argue that the conventional view on the Devonian as \u2018all overprint\u2019 is unlikely to provide a sole explanation for the scarcity of good Devonian paleomagnetic results, as intense overprinting cannot explain the presence of directional groups or large directional scatter.\n\n\n\n8\nDid Earth\u2019s magnetic field have an impact on life in the Devonian?\nThe remarkable evolutionary dynamics of the Middle-Late Devonian, with multiple extinctions of marine faunas, are summarised in Fig. 26\n. Following Becker et al. (2016, 2020), biotic events are ranked from most severe 1st order mass extinctions, to progressively less severe 2nd, 3rd and 4th order events. As highlighted above, there has been much debate on the causes of the Late Devonian mass extinctions, with a variety of suggested triggers, including explosive volcanism, global warming and cooling, or multi-causal processes. The fact that the events themselves consist of multiple steps reflects the complexity of extinction-radiation pathways (e.g., Aretz, 2021; Boyer et al., 2021; Fields et al., 2020; Kaiho et al., 2021; Marshall, 2021; McGhee and Racki, 2021; Paschall et al., 2019).\n\nMarshall et al. (2020) have linked the terrestrial phase of the Hangenberg Crisis at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary to an increase in ultraviolet (specifically, UV-B) radiation, which they hypothesize is caused by an increase in convective transport of chlorine monoxide through global warming. Fields et al. (2020) disputed this and have instead suggested that increased UV-B radiation during the Hangenberg Crisis was caused by supernovae. Another proposed mechanism for partial destruction of the ozone layer is by explosive volcanism (e.g., Kutterolf et al., 2013; Self, 2015). Volcanism has been often invoked to be a main factor in end Devonian biotic crises, but there has been considerable discussion on which volcanic province was responsible (e.g., Racki, 2020). There are several candidates, such as the large igneous province of the Viluy traps in Siberia, the Kola traps in Russia and the Pripyat-Dnieper-Donets province (Kravchinsky, 2012) (see also Fig. 26). Sudden increases in UV-B radiation reaching the surface of the Earth have been linked to a weak shielding of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere by the magnetic field in other geologic periods (e.g., Meert et al., 2016). Earth\u2019s magnetic field protects the atmosphere by deflecting charged particles coming from the sun (solar wind). When Earth's magnetic field is weak, the solar wind is not deflected to the same extent, and can reach the upper atmosphere, where charged particles interact with the ozone layer. These charged particles dissociate N2 and O2, which contributes to the formation of NOx and HOx in the middle atmosphere, which in turn are key in the depletion of stratospheric ozone (e.g., Meert et al., 2016; Vogt et al., 2007). The depletion of the ozone layer increases UV-B radiation reaching Earth\u2019s surface.\nUnderstanding the strength and shape of the Devonian magnetosphere and its concomitant magnetic shielding is critical for assessing increased penetration of charged solar particles into the atmosphere (relative to the present day or Phanerozoic average). A first-order approximation of the degree of magnetospheric shielding by the geomagnetic field is to quantify the distance to the magnetopause (the point at which solar wind pressure is balanced by Earth's magnetic field). We use the assumptions that virtual dipole moments represent a strictly dipole field, and that non-dipole contributions to field (both instantaneous and secular variation) resemble the present day field. These are conservative assumptions, which are expected to maximize the estimated magnetic shielding during the Devonian (following the approach of Tarduno et al., 2010). The estimated magnetopause standoff distances are presented in Fig. 25b.\nThe present day magnetopause is observed to be at a distance of \u223c10 Earth radii (RE); under normal conditions, a value that fluctuates on annual time scales by \u2264 1 RE due to changes in the location of the magnetic pole relative to the spin axis. The estimated magnetic standoff distance for the Early Devonian is consistent with that of the long-term Phanerozoic average (\u223c8 RE). During the Late Devonian nadir in field strength, the standoff distance was reduced to \u223c4\u22125 RE. This distance is comparable to, or less than, the standoff distance minima observed during the Halloween 2003 event, a solar storm event which resulted in sufficient penetration of charged particles to generate auroras at low latitudes and disrupt the electrical grid in Sweden (Rosenqvist et al., 2005). However, unlike the Halloween 2003 event, which lasted on the order of days and can be seen as an ephemeral reduction in shielding, the standoff distance estimated for the Late Devonian represents the average standoff distance for millions to tens of millions of years. This reduction in shielding could be further exacerbated by magnetic storms and coronal mass ejections during the Devonian. Typical space weather can reduce the present-day magnetopause by \u223c1\u22122 RE (Voigt, 1995), with greater reduction during more extreme events (e.g., Halloween 2003 event). If the paleomagnetosphere during the Devonian was substantially weaker and potentially less dipolar, as suggested by the paleomagnetic data, then shielding reductions during space weather events could be greater.\nAn additional property of the paleomagnetosphere is the magnetic polar cap: the region defined by open dipole field lines, inside which charged solar ions are funnelled towards Earth\u2019s surface. A second-order consequence of the polar cap is the occurrence of polar auroras at the lower latitudinal boundary of the polar cap. If the time-averaged paleomagnetic field is assumed to be fairly GAD-like during the Late Devonian, the lower bound of the polar cap (\u03bb\n\nP\n) and its surface area, can be estimated (following the approach of Siscoe and Chen (1975); see Supplementary file S9). During the Early Devonian, the median \u03bb\n\nP\n is estimated to be 68.9\u00b0 (with an interquartile range spanning 66.2\u00b0 to 69.5\u00b0; see Fig. 27a) which is somewhat lower than the present day latitude (71.9\u00b0; Siscoe and Chen, 1975) and suggests an increase in the relative surface area of the polar cap of \u223c1.5 times the present day shielding (Fig. 27b). When the geomagnetic field intensity was reduced during the Late Devonian, the polar cap could extend further southward to 63.7\u00b0 (with an interquartile range spanning 61.8\u00b0 to 65.0\u00b0; see Fig. 27c). This represents an increase in the surface area (relative to today) of a factor of \u223c2 (Fig. 27d), broadening the region where Earth\u2019s atmospheric ozone could be eroded due to dissociation of N2 and O2.\nIf the time-averaged field was substantially different from GAD, it is probable that the standoff distance could be further reduced and the validity of the polar cap description (with associated \u03bb\n\nP\n) could diminish. As the contribution of a quadrupolar field increases relative to the dipole moment (a scenario representing the longest wavelength description of the non-dipole field), it is expected that \u03bb\n\nP\n could migrate up to \u223c10\u00b0 towards the equator (Vogt et al., 2007). In a more extreme departure from a GAD field, models of the paleomagnetosphere during a simulated geomagnetic reversal (Stadelmann, 2004) suggest all latitudes could be susceptible to large fluxes of charged particles during extended periods of a weak, non-dipolar field.\nWe hypothesise that the magnetic field during the Devonian was in such a weak and unstable state that it constituted a substantial additional hazard for life. However, with our current knowledge, it is hard to estimate the contribution a weak magnetic field had in biotic crises in the Devonian. The weak magnetic field could have triggered specific biotic crises associated with its long-term secular variation (i.e. on the 105-106 year timescale), or its longer-term state (i.e. on the 107-108 year timescale) could have been a constant factor that enabled other triggers to have a bigger impact on the biosphere. Based on paleointensity evidence, we infer that Earth\u2019s magnetic field was extremely weak during the Devonian, and possibly periodically had a non-axial dipole configuration. Life during the Devonian thus might have been continuously \u2018on the edge\u2019 because of the weak protection of the atmosphere by the magnetic field, which meant that other triggers such as volcanism could have more easily enabled biological crises. The weak magnetic field could thus be one of the influencing factors in the multi-causal model that is favoured for the Late Devonian biotic crises (Racki, 2020). However, it is also possible that the field during the Devonian directly enabled biological crises through depletion of the ozone layer, which allowed more UV-B radiation to reach Earth\u2019s surface. In this case, however, it would be expected that malformed spores would be more widespread, and associated with other parts of the Devonian, instead of in distinctive intervals as the study of Marshall et al. (2020) suggests.\nFuture studies might provide perspectives on the causes for ozone depletion by looking at the duration of increased UV-B radiation, and assessing if there is evidence for enhanced UV-B radiation in the Early and Middle Devonian. The timescales on which UV-B radiation interacts with life on Earth, and the latitudes for which this effect is greatest are different for different causes of ozone layer depletion. For explosive volcanism, Self (2015) mentions that the increase in UV-B radiation reaches high and mid-latitudes and the effect lasts for a few years after the explosive eruption. Fields et al. (2020) discuss the scenario presented by Marshall et al. (2020), and note that the effect of the proposed mechanism would last only a few weeks. While the timescales associated with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field are highly variable (hours to millions of years), we think it is most plausible that the field was extremely weak for several tens of millions of years, as suggested by (Hawkins et al., 2021), and thus acted as a continuous stressor.\n\n\n9\nOutstanding questions pertaining to paleomagnetism of the Devonian\nDespite the substantial amount of effort being expended, the body of knowledge concerned with most aspects of paleomagnetism in the Devonian remains small with respect to other geologic periods. Negative results are seldom published so it is likely that there may have been many more attempts at obtaining magnetostratigraphic records and other paleomagnetic data from Devonian rocks than the ones cited in our review. The timing and rate of polarity changes during the Devonian remains uncertain, and paleopole constraints on Devonian paleogeography are fragile and prone to controversial interpretations. A Devonian GPTS would fill in a major gap in the Paleozoic timescale, and would have great utility in high resolution global correlation since the Devonian was a time of many global crises including one of the \u2018big five\u2019 mass extinctions. For the study of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, polarity records from the Devonian would allow assessment of the reversal frequency for an interval of some 60 million years duration. Reversal frequencies for other periods in geological history are a key constraint on the operation and evolution of the geodynamo with strong implications for mantle-forcing potentially linked to surface processes (e.g., Amit and Olson, 2015; Hounslow et al., 2018). Obtaining reliable Devonian paleopoles would be of huge benefit to precisely constrain paleolatitudes of the continents, and could significantly improve paleogeographic reconstructions.\nPresently, the creation of a GPTS for the Devonian appears to be a task that will take several more decades of study to resolve, if at all possible. If the field in the Devonian was indeed multipolar in certain intervals, creating a global GPTS may be impossible, as creation of the GPTS is reliant on a dipolar field. To further understand the enigmatic field in the Devonian, we need more paleomagnetic data tightly linked to detailed stratigraphic-based studies both on sediments and volcanic rocks. Our overview of Devonian paleomagnetism raises rather more questions than it answers, and we hope that this study will promote new paleomagnetic studies on Devonian rocks. Furthermore, if studies can demonstrate (as we have attempted here), that the lack of conventional utility of a paleomagnetic dataset cannot readily be ascribed to the recording medium, then this serves as a direct test of the central hypothesis outlined here. In any case, we urge authors to supply their full data with their publications. Currently, many of the old data is difficult to assess, as they lack supplementary information.\nStudies on (malformed) spores could also aid in assessing burial temperatures, and thus are a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of overprinting of the paleomagnetic signal. Marshall et al. (2020) mentioned that the thermal maturity of the spores in their studied section indicates a burial temperature of 107\u00b0C, a temperature at which it is likely that the paleomagnetic signal could be preserved. Future studies could focus on determining when the weak field period ended and the magnetic field recovered. It is likely that this is sometime during the Carboniferous, as many Devonian data seem to have late Carboniferous overprints. Data from the Kiaman superchron generally seem robust, indicating that the field must have recovered by the onset of the Kiaman superchron. For the beginning of the weak field period, we should look at the latest times prior to the Devonian for which paleomagnetic data show good results.\nIf the field was indeed extremely weak and the reduction in magnetic shielding had an influence on life on Earth, there might be more indications for increased UV-B radiation found in the biological record of the Devonian (e.g., Marshall et al., 2020). We suggest that this could be an interesting target for future studies. If there is no evidence for increased UV-B radiation elsewhere in the Devonian, this could imply that either the field was weaker or different in the Late Devonian compared to the Early and Middle Devonian, or the field was not a determining factor in the increase in UV-B radiation observed at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. Another intriguing question is whether the field could have had an impact on oceanic anoxia, perhaps through a link with partial destruction of the ozone layer, which would have been accompanied by a depletion of oxygen in the atmosphere (e.g., Meert et al., 2016; Vogt et al., 2007). The reverse has already been suggested for the Mesozoic, in which ocean anoxia ended through enrichment of atmospheric oxygen (e.g., Baker et al., 2017; Tsandev and Slomp, 2009).\nAnother major avenue of future work will be to investigate the mechanism behind the weak field period in the Paleozoic. Studies that modelled the geodynamo have suggested that the formation of the inner core would have caused the field to increase in strength (Driscoll, 2016). A recent estimate for inner core nucleation placed it at 565 Ma (Bono et al., 2019) but the actual timing remains highly contested (Biggin et al., 2015; Kodama et al., 2019; Lloyd et al., 2021; Smirnov et al., 2016; Sprain et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, the theoretically plausible range is extremely broad (~400-1800 Ma) and encompasses the Devonian (Davies et al., 2015). While it is therefore not implausible that a weak field existed in the Devonian because of marginal thermal convection ahead of inner core nucleation (in a scenario similar to that suggested by e.g., Bono et al., 2019, but ~150 Myr later), other explanations exist. In the last 200 Myr, the paleomagnetic field is observed to have undergone a long-term cyclic change, plunging into a hyper-reversing weak-field state in the Middle Jurassic, followed by a sharp recovery into the strong and stable Cretaceous Normal Superchron and subsequently monotonically destabilising over the last ca. 100 Myr (Biggin et al., 2012). Such an evolution is very likely linked to changes in conditions at the base of the mantle, influencing heat flow across the core-mantle boundary that is ultimately responsible for driving the geodynamo (McFadden and Merrill, 1984). Since ~200 Myr may be an emergent timescale of mantle convection (Coltice et al., 2013), it is tempting to view the Devonian as analogous to the Middle Jurassic weak-field hyper-reversing state (but probably more extreme and longer lasting) in a similar ca. 200 Myr cycle occurring previous to the most recent one. In such a scenario, paleomagnetic behaviour again recovered sharply from this weak, unstable state and evolved quickly into a stable, strong superchron (in this case, the Kiaman).\nThere have been several recent attempts to explain cyclic variations in paleomagnetic behaviour under the assumption that mantle forcing of the geodynamo is the causative mechanism (Amit and Olson, 2015; Biggin et al., 2012; Hounslow et al., 2018). These have all assumed that weak-field, hyper-reversing behaviour, such as that invoked for the Devonian, occurs as a result of core-mantle heat flow being elevated, globally or equatorially, and\/or being more heterogeneous in comparison to more stable intervals. Such distinct core-mantle conditions could be related to prior reductions in subduction flux (Hounslow et al., 2018), superplume growth (Amit and Olson, 2015), and\/or episodes of true polar wander (Biggin et al., 2012). Biggin et al. (2012) originally assessed the possible effect of true polar wander on the geodynamo in the interval 0-300 Ma using the record of Torsvik et al. (2012). They inferred that in the geodynamo\u2019s frame of reference, and assuming lowermost mantle heterogeneity similar to that observed today by seismology, core-mantle heat flow was elevated in the equatorial region at the time of the mid-Jurassic reversal hyperactivity. Their proxy for equatorial core-mantle boundary heat flow potentially provided an explanation for magnetic reversal behaviour at this time and during the subsequent transition to a non-reversing state in the mid-Cretaceous. Here, we extend this analysis back in time using a 0-450 Ma record of true polar wander (Torsvik et al., 2014).\nRemarkably, the extended analysis (Fig. 28\n) describes a distinct minimum in the equatorial heat flow proxy in the middle part of the Kiaman superchron as would be expected if true polar wander played a significant role in controlling reversal frequency in the late Palaeozoic. More pertinently, it also describes a strong peak spanning the Devonian and early Carboniferous, predicting a maximum in reversal frequency at this time. This analysis does not support that true polar wander can account for the entirety of observed changes in paleomagnetic behaviour for the interval 0-450 Ma. Nevertheless, we consider the hypothesis, supported by this analysis, that true polar wander played a role in producing extreme paleomagnetic field behaviour in the Devonian to be worthy of further testing with new datasets and simulations.\n\n\n10\nConclusions\nWe have presented new paleomagnetic data from four sections, as well as a detailed review of literature surrounding Devonian paleomagnetism. This synthesis has yielded the primary conclusion that the geomagnetic field in the Devonian field was probably substantially different to that of most of the subsequent Phanerozoic. We have explored the implications of a weak and potentially less dipole-dominated magnetic field during this interval of geologic history and attempted to outline a clear direction for future research in this area.\nOur newly acquired paleomagnetic data from four Devonian sections provide challenging results to interpret. The data are not straightforward and strong overprints, both by Kiaman (Permo-Carboniferous reverse superchron) and recent fields, are evident. The remaining paleomagnetic signals are of varying quality, due partly to strong component overlap. The Blankenheim section in Germany shows Devonian-like directions of reverse polarity, which agrees with results from previous studies. However, as there are no field tests available, we cannot exclude the possibility that the obtained directions somehow result from a mixture of a recent field and Kiaman overprint. Polish carbonates show results characteristic for a Devonian field of normal polarity, with several samples likely representing reverse polarity. Again, due to the absence of field tests, we cannot completely rule out that the reverse polarity is a mixture between a recent field and Kiaman overprint. The characteristic directions from the Hume Formation in Canada show extremely large scatter in addition to recent and Kiaman overprints, and we cannot interpret these in a meaningful way. The large scatter is reminiscent of other studies on the Frasnian-Famennian from the Canning Basin.\nWe have reviewed a significant part of the available paleomagnetic data in the Devonian, which shows that most data are problematic. Data show directional groups or extreme scatter in many cases. We urge caution in using Devonian paleopoles for plate tectonic reconstructions and argue for a revision of the geomagnetic polarity timescale presented for the Devonian, as the reversal history is essentially unknown throughout the Devonian. More Devonian paleomagnetic studies are urgently needed to resolve these issues. While there are still many uncertainties regarding the field in the Devonian, it is plausible that the geomagnetic field was extremely weak and perhaps had a non-dipolar configuration. We consider it unlikely that any of the classically invoked reasons, such as pervasive overprinting or unsuitable lithologies, are the prime cause for the absence of high quality, unambiguous paleomagnetic data during this time period. Here we pose the question whether the weak field poorly shielded life on Earth during the Devonian, and if it was a contributing factor to the many biotic crises in this period.\nWe strongly emphasise the need for more paleomagnetic data from the Devonian, in particular in the Early and Middle Devonian. There is a general lack of data in all paleomagnetic disciplines; paleopoles, magnetostratigraphy and paleointensity. The lack of paleopoles hampers accurate plate tectonic reconstructions through the Devonian, leading to uncertainty on climatic belts and paleogeographic reconstructions. Due to the lack of magnetostratigraphic data for the Devonian, we cannot assess reversal frequencies, which impacts the understanding of the evolution of the Earth\u2019s core and geodynamo. Construction of magnetostratigraphic records is dependent on the assumption of a geocentric axial dipole time-averaged field. If the Devonian geomagnetic field was indeed non-dipolar, as has been suggested, construction of a polarity record for (parts of) the Devonian would be impossible. Increasing the record of paleointensity data in the Devonian will allow assessment of the hypothesised relationship between the magnetic field, biotic crises and true polar wander.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nSamples from Poland were collected on several field trips by A. van der Boon, A.

Quantifications of the frequency with which channels avulse are crucial for research aiming to improve our understanding of (i) landscape change associated with channel morphodynamics, (ii) the role of autogenic mechanisms in governing the spatio-temporal variability in sediment distribution in sedimentary basins, and (iii) controls on the architecture of sedimentary successions (e.g., Bryant et al., 1995; Pelletier and Turcotte, 1997; Jerolmack and Mohrig, 2007; Gouw, 2008). However, the quantification of the frequency of avulsion events is not trivial. This quantification is commonly expressed in terms of interavulsion period, i.e., the lifespan of a channel, or its reciprocal value, the avulsion frequency (T\u00f6rnqvist, 1994; Stouthamer and Berendsen, 2001; T\u00f6rnqvist and Bridge, 2002; Slingerland and Smith, 2004). Yet, it can be surmised that these quantities depend on the spatial scale of the sample on which they are based (e.g., a reach of a certain length, a delta plain, an entire river system). In particular, these quantities depend on the total, cumulative channel length considered, which is itself a function of the extent of the area being evaluated and of the density of the channel network contained therein (cf. Stouthamer and Berendsen, 2007). This supposed dependency of avulsion frequencies on spatial scale has implications for the ability to make direct comparisons between different channelized systems. Equally, quantifications of the frequency of avulsion events may also vary depending on the temporal window over which they are determined. For datasets detailing Holocene avulsion histories, this may happen in part because of variations in avulsion frequency through time, in relation to temporal variations in the influence of geological controls, and in part because of the increased difficulty in resolving avulsion records as we consider progressively older episodes of river-system evolution. In considering the potential relationships between avulsion-frequency quantifications and the scales over which they are made, a question arises as to whether these quantities may be affected by factors whose importance is known to scale to the size of the sediment-routing system. For coastal-plain rivers, in particular, the scale of the fluvial system dictates characteristics such as the dominant sediment-delivery mechanisms, the streambed gradient, the extent of the backwater zone, and the rate at which the shoreline progrades (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011; Blum et al., 2013; Aadland and Helland-Hansen, 2019). These factors can all influence the avulsion frequency of coastal channels, for instance by exerting controls on streambed aggradation and development of cross-channel gradient advantages (Jones and Schumm, 1999; Slingerland and Smith, 2004). On this basis, it can be hypothesized, for example, that larger river systems, typically associated with faster river-mouth progradation and gentler streambed gradient, may be prone to experience more frequent channel avulsions. At the same time, however, larger deltas may be characterized by less erodible delta-plain substrates, which may on the contrary offer increased resistance to channel diversions (cf. Edmonds and Slingerland, 2010). It is therefore of interest to establish whether some inherent scaling exists between avulsion frequencies and river-system scale. Given the particular set of scale-dependent variables that may control avulsion dynamics in lowland rivers, the focus of this work is specifically on fluvial systems that developed in relative proximity to the coast.\nThe aim of this work is to establish the degree to which avulsion-frequency metrics may depend on the temporal and spatial scales of investigation. Specific research questions are as follows. What quantification is needed to enable meaningful comparisons of avulsion frequencies relating to different river systems? If these metrics are seen to vary across spatio-temporal scales, what are the possible methodological and geological explanation of apparent variations? Given the inherent covariance of factors that are linked to river-system scale, and considering how these variables act to control river avulsion, is avulsion frequency intrinsically dependent on river-system size?\nWhat this work does not aim to achieve is a comprehensive assessment of controls on avulsion frequencies, which are partly determined by factors that act independently of scale. Nevertheless, to understand whether potential dependency of avulsion frequency on scale is an apparent (i.e., due to methodological reasons) or true (i.e., due to geological reasons) phenomenon, we need to consider the role of potential geological controls that could cause it.\n\n\n2\nData and methods\n\n2.1\nOriginal literature data\nThe dataset that underpins the quantifications presented in this work consists of qualitative documentations of the Holocene avulsion histories of 57 case studies of river deltas and alluvial coastal plains (Table 1\n; Fig. 1A). These examples were chosen based on the availability of suitable data documenting avulsion histories, channel activity and\/or delta-lobe development over known temporal intervals. The case studies include both marginal-marine and marginal-lacustrine examples. Collectively, they cover a broad range of river-system scales (five orders of magnitude in drainage-basin area; Fig. 1B). The selected marginal-marine examples also developed under varied process regimes, i.e., they differ with respect to the relative importance of fluvial, wave and tidal processes in shaping their morphology and controlling their evolution (Fig. 1C); however, the dataset is characterized by a predominance of river-dominated settings (28, compared to 17 wave-dominated ones and 3 tide-dominated ones), which may not be representative of deltaic systems globally (cf. Nienhuis et al., 2020). All the data are derived from open-source scientific literature (articles, dissertations, reports). The original studies documented the temporal evolution of lowland rivers through variable time spans of the Holocene. The planform evolutions of these river systems were characterized in terms of one or more of the following aspects: (i) courses of abandoned channels (palaeochannels), as well as presently active ones, (ii) location of avulsion sites and events, and\/or (iii) position and extent of delta lobes. The occurrence of these features was variably determined on the basis of evidence available through historical maps or records (e.g., Bondesan et al., 1995; Mateo and Siringan, 2007), remote sensing (including satellite images, aerial photos, LiDAR or InSAR elevation data; e.g., Serrano Suarez, 2004; Phillips, 2012; Syvitski et al., 2013; Haghani and Leroy, 2020), and field investigations providing data on surface geomorphology and on the shallow subsurface geology (based on borehole and geophysical observations; e.g., Berendsen and Stouthamer, 2002; Fielding et al., 2006; El Bastawesy et al., 2017). The Holocene histories were reconstructed based on available temporal constraints: radiometric dates (e.g., Mu\u00f1oz-Salinas et al., 2017), historical accounts (e.g., Holmes, 1968), archaeological evidence (e.g., Stanley et al., 2004), and historical maps, satellite images or aerial photos of known age (e.g., Karymbalis et al., 2016). Where multiple suitable data sources existed for the same case study, the datasets were integrated into a single reconstruction, if possible. Where discrepancies existed in the interpretations of Holocene histories based on different datasets available for the same case study, the interpretations that were considered were those supported by the most robust evidence and associated with higher-resolution data in terms of recognition of geological features and\/or chronological constraints. Chronometric data were sourced from the wider literature, additional to the data sources on planform changes. All primary data sources are reported in Table 1.\n\n\n2.2\nApproaches to the quantification of avulsion frequency\nSome alternative ways to quantify the frequency of river avulsion were considered, based on three fundamental quantities: (i) the number of avulsion events that occurred during a time interval, (ii) the number of channels that were active during a time interval, and which may or may not have been abandoned during that time (active channels and palaeochannels are collectively referred to as \u2018channel threads\u2019 hereafter), and (iii) the number of delta lobes that were active, and which may or may not have been abandoned, during a time interval (Fig. 2\n). For each case study, the time intervals considered for each quantification may differ, depending on the available records of each type of quantity. These numbers were determined over a study area of given size, typically the entire delta plain or the portion of a coastal plain that was active during the specified time (referred to as \u2018study area', hereafter). The size of the study areas is in part dictated by data coverage; hence, for each case study, the considered area may have differed for the three forms of quantification. In some cases, the defined study areas cover regions that are now located at considerable distance from the present-day coast: this is because study areas are defined to capture river reaches that developed in proximity of the shoreline in the past, and many of the studied examples have undergone extensive shoreline progradation over the timescales of interest.\nThe number of avulsion events considered includes both \u2018full' and \u2018partial' avulsions of reaches that lead to a river mouth; full avulsions consist of channel diversions that lead to the abandonment of a reach, whereas partial avulsions represent events that cause the establishment of a new course that coexists with the antecedent one (Slingerland and Smith, 2004). Events of levee break forming crevasse splays or subdeltas that are only active at high flow stage are not considered as avulsion events. Neck and chute cutoffs, which occur within the boundaries of channel belts, are not treated as avulsions. The avulsion events considered in the quantification correspond to those that are significant enough to be recorded in the data sources (Table 1); as such, resulting metrics suffer from some subjectivity and are likely to represent conservative estimates. The number of avulsion events could be obtained for 28 of the 57 case studies; however, avulsion counts are thought to be accurate estimations of a true total number for 17 examples only.\nThe number of channel threads includes all the river courses leading to a river mouth that were active during the considered timespan, including those that may have been activated before. All throughgoing channel courses that are mapped and inferred to have been hydrologically connected to the river are included, regardless of their size. Inclusion of channels that may have already been active was done to broaden the temporal window of the observations as much as possible, as the exact timing of activation of older palaeochannels is in many cases unknown. However, this poses an issue in that the number of channel forms whose activation pre-dated the studied temporal interval may vary across the studied river systems. This quantity also includes channel threads that may have been established through avulsions that took place outside of the study area. Palaeochannels that are known to have been born from bifurcations around mouth bars at the coast, and which may have been incorporated into the delta plain following shoreline advance, have been excluded. As defined in this work, the term \u2018channel thread\u2019 is used to refer to individual distributary courses, which may take the form of channel belts with multiple channels: a braided channel belt is counted as one single \u2018channel thread\u2019. The number of channel threads could be obtained for 54 of the 57 case studies, 51 of which are considered to have been characterized comprehensively.\nThe number of delta lobes quantifies the number of avulsions that are significant enough \u2013 in terms of magnitude of river-mouth relocation \u2013 to cause lobe switching. For the scopes of this work, a \u2018delta lobe\u2019 is defined as a three-dimensional sediment volume made of cogenetic delta-top, delta-front and prodelta deposits associated with a particular state of the drainage network that arose because of river avulsion (cf. Colombera and Mountney, 2020, and references therein). Different diagnostic criteria may have been considered in the original data sources for the definition of delta lobes, such as the recognition of prodelta to delta-top facies successions, the lenticular three-dimensional shape of sediment accumulations, or some preserved seaward protrusion in planform, related to abandoned river mouths. The chosen definition of a delta lobe can be applied at different scales to units that may even be nested hierarchically. The data were extracted relying on the application of the term \u2018delta lobe\u2019 by the authors of the original datasets; doing so means considering entities that are not necessarily comparable in terms of scale of development, but permits this category to be applied objectively. Accounts of delta lobes exist for 25 of the 57 case studies, but numbers of delta lobes developed over a known length of time are only thought to be comprehensive for 16 of these.\nThe numbers of avulsion events, channel threads, and delta lobes per unit time are each considered as alternative proxies for channel avulsion frequencies. In addition, all these quantities are normalized relative to the planform extent of the study area considered for each. This permits determination of avulsion \u2018density\u2019, describing the number of avulsion events, channel threads or delta lobes both per unit time and per unit area. The study area considered for this type of normalization corresponds to the coastal-plain area of interest covered by the river system up to the present day: i.e., currently drowned delta lobes are included, whereas any change in area due to coastal progradation is not quantified. These metrics are referred to as rates normalized by area, hereafter.\nSome additional normalization has also been applied to the avulsion metrics of eight examples, representing the Holocene histories of coastal plains traversed by multiple coalescing river systems that joined intermittently. The quantities are normalized by the maximum number of river systems with distinct catchments known to have had independent drainage to the sea or lake at some point during the considered evolutionary histories; this value ranges from one, for the 49 examples not requiring normalization, to four. These metrics are referred to as rates normalized by area and river number, hereafter.\n\n\n2.3\nAncillary data and associated quantifications\nAncillary data have been collected to constrain variables that describe the river systems and that are known to scale with their size. Among these, the variables considered in this study are: (i) river-system drainage-basin areas, (ii) average river water-surface gradients across the study areas; (iii) mean annual water discharges as based on observations from gauging stations located near the upstream end of the study area (data from the Global Runoff Data Centre, from the primary data sources of Table 1, and from the wider scientific literature: Begg, 1978; Poulos and Chronis, 1997; Fytianos et al., 2002; Kao and Milliman, 2008; Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011; Cohen et al., 2013; Efstratiadis et al., 2014; Pueppke et al., 2018; Skoulikidis et al., 2018; Nienhuis et al., 2020), (iv) suspended sediment loads (data from the primary data sources of Table 1 and from the literature: Ashmore and Day, 1988; Poulos and Chronis, 1997; Rivera, 1997; Erkens et al., 2006; Syvitski and Saito, 2007; Kettner and Syvitski, 2008; Rustomji, 2010; Bernardes et al., 2012; Milliman and Farnsworth, 2011; Potemkina, 2011; Cohen et al., 2013; Duskayev et al., 2020), (v) empirical estimations of bankfull width and mean bankfull depth at the upstream end of the study area, as provided by Andreadis et al. (2013). Where available, data on water discharge and sediment load have been used that relate to times prior to the construction of dams, which may have significantly altered these quantities.\nShoreline progradation rates are calculated as increases in coastal-plain area per unit shoreline width per unit time; these rates are computed based on temporal constraints available in the scientific literature, and over a timescale of equivalent order of magnitude to that of one or more of the avulsion-frequency proxies computed for each case study.\nBackwater lengths are estimated as the ratio between flow depth at the upstream end of the study area and the water-surface gradient across the study area, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the streambed gradient (cf. Paola, 2000). Alternative quantifications of backwater lengths are computed according to three different approaches based on (i) mean bankfull depth (Andreadis et al., 2013), (ii) a characteristic flow depth based on mean yearly discharge and bankfull width (cf. Lamb et al., 2012), and (iii) a characteristic flow depth determined from the mean discharge of the wettest month and bankfull width (cf. Chatanantavet et al., 2012; Lamb et al., 2012; Ganti et al., 2016a). Results of the application of the three approaches have been compared with each other, as well as with other estimations of backwater lengths for the same coastal rivers (Jerolmack, 2009; Chatanantavet et al., 2012; Ganti et al., 2016b; Hartley et al., 2017). This was done to establish the sensibility of the quantifications. As the three chosen approaches yield similar results, for scopes of data presentation, only backwater-length estimations based on inferred mean bankfull depths are presented, since these could be constrained for the largest number of case studies (N\u00a0=\u00a050).\n\n\n2.4\nDataset limitations\nEach of the chosen alternative approaches to the quantification of avulsion frequency suffers from some issues. All the metrics may be affected by some degree of human regulation of the river systems, especially in the form of controls on river drainage and efforts for preventing river avulsions, which might have varied across the case studies, as well as through time and spatially in each. This reflects the scarcity of detailed and extended records of avulsion histories of persistently pristine coastal-plain river systems on which to perform a study of this type. Known artificial diversions (and resulting channels) are not treated as avulsions (or products thereof), but a detailed record of human intervention may be lacking for the earliest times of river histories. The only forms of quantification of avulsion frequency that are potentially precise are those based on the number of avulsion events; yet these are unlikely to be accurate in practice due to the fragmentary nature of historical records, especially over millennial timescales. The adoption of the number of channel threads as a proxy for avulsion frequency is subject to several notable problems. The number of channel threads could include a count of palaeochannels whose inception was related to artificial diversions that were not documented as such. The same number fails to quantify re-occupational avulsion events (i.e., the avulsive reoccupation of previously abandoned reaches; Aslan et al., 2005; Reitz et al., 2010; Stouthamer et al., 2011; Reitz and Jerolmack, 2012). It may also include examples of distributary channels whose inception was not due to avulsion, such as for example groundwater-fed channels, or distributary channels that originated from bifurcations around mouth bars (Edmonds and Slingerland, 2007; Hoyal and Sheets, 2009). It also considers particular forms of avulsion \u2018by annexation' (sensu Slingerland and Smith, 2004), such as where groundwater-fed tributaries propagate upstream to intersect other channel reaches, or where tidal channels extend updip to achieve connection with fluvial drainage (cf. Mulrennan and Woodroffe, 1998). The number of delta lobes may underestimate avulsion frequency significantly, as the distinction of delta lobes may depend on the amount of lateral offset of a river and its mouth, which is controlled in part by the variable rates of accommodation generation in the nearshore (e.g., Restrepo and Cantera, 2013). Additionally, the term \u2018delta lobe\u2019 may be applied to parts of deltas that themselves are known to have experienced multiple avulsions (e.g., Kazanc\u0131 and Gulbabazadeh, 2013) or to have been traversed by multiple (palaeo)channels (e.g., Karymbalis et al., 2018; Dong, 2020). Also, the timing of lobe development may be offset relative to the timing of creation of its feeder channel, as lobe growth may be related to variations in the partitioning of discharge and sediment load across multiple distributaries (cf. Vespremeanu-Stroe et al., 2017a).\nData on the relative timing of avulsion events of known location, or of the inception of palaeochannels of known location, are not recorded, since these facts are only known for few examples (e.g., Stouthamer et al., 2011; Somoza and Rodr\u00edguez-Santalla, 2014). This limits the types of analyses that can be undertaken with the current dataset.\nSome river-system variables (bankfull hydraulic geometry, backwater length) represent estimations based on proxy datasets. The variables that characterize the river systems may only reflect present-day or recent conditions; these may not approximate those of pristine natural states, and\/or are unlikely to be representative of the entire Holocene timespan over which avulsion metrics have been determined.\nThe selected case studies are not representative of all types of channel networks seen in coastal-plain river systems. In particular, a bias is likely to exist because studies of avulsion dynamics may focus preferentially on markedly avulsive river systems. Examples for which avulsions are undocumented in the Holocene record (e.g., Mekong, Tamura et al., 2012; Yangtze, Chen and Stanley, 1995) have necessarily been excluded.\nThe dataset is heterogeneous in terms of the size of the considered study areas relative to the coastal domain. In some cases, the apex of a delta can be identified on the basis of the recognition of topographic slope breaks, alluvial-valley outlets or persistent avulsion nodes (cf. Stouthamer and Berendsen, 2000; Syvitski et al., 2013; Nooren et al., 2017); in these cases, the extent of the delta sets the size of the study area, provided that the spatial coverage of avulsion-proxy data extends to the delta apex. In the absence of delta apices, the selection of an upstream boundary for areas of interest is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, and placed in such way that the study areas may extend beyond present-day coastal regions. The study areas outline portions of the river systems that have developed relatively near the shoreline at some point in time, but which may now occur far upstream of the coast, where avulsion dynamics may differ. By taking this approach, avulsion events that have occurred in these settings are included in the study. Defining study areas dynamically, so as to track the regressive evolution of the systems, would enable improved analyses; however, this approach is rendered difficult in practice by the limited temporal resolution of avulsion events and palaeoshoreline positions.\n\n\n2.5\nStatistical analyses\nAn assessment is made of relationships between the different avulsion-frequency proxies, between avulsion metrics and the temporal and spatial scales over which they have been determined, and between avulsion metrics and variables describing properties of the river system that are known to reflect its scale. The sign and magnitude of correlations have been quantified by Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients of the variables or by Pearson correlation coefficients of their corresponding logarithmic transformations. t-tests and Welch's one-way ANOVA have been applied to assess statistical significance of differences in mean values of variables across two or more groups of observations, respectively. Normality in data distributions has been tested by Shapiro-Wilk tests. Logarithmic variable transformations have been applied to account for deviations from normality and homoscedasticity in data distributions, to ensure that the assumptions for the use of parametric statistical tests are met; t-tests and ANOVA have been applied to log-transformed variables where needed. Statistical significance of both correlations and statistical tests is quantified by p-values; outcomes are stated as significant for \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05. Datasets that are considered as representing relatively complete records of avulsion histories (Table 1), based on what is reported in the data sources and on critical analysis of the broader literature on the same case studies, are labelled as being of \u2018higher quality\u2019; these are considered separately from the entire data pools in some of the analyses.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nAvulsion metrics and data quality\nSome differences are seen in the distributions of avulsion metrics across classes of data quality that reflect the completeness of the associated records (Table 1); yet, these differences are not systematic across the three alternative avulsion-frequency proxies (also termed avulsion \u2018rates\u2019 hereafter for the sake of brevity). Rates based on the number of avulsion events are lower on average for datasets flagged as being of lower quality (Fig. 3a, b). For rates based on counts, mean values are 34.2 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a017) and 2.8 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a011), and standard deviations are equal to 101.3 kyr\u22121 and 3.2 kyr\u22121, for higher and lower-quality datasets respectively; a two-sample t-test conducted on log-transformed values of these variables indicates that the difference in mean is statistically significant (T-value\u00a0=\u00a02.15, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.041, degrees of freedom [d.f.]\u00a0=\u00a026). For rates normalized by area and river number, mean values are 0.063 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.042 kyr\u22121km\u22122, and standard deviations are 0.162 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.104 kyr\u22121km\u22122, for high and low-quality datasets respectively; however, a two-sample t-test on log-transformed values of these variables indicates that mean values do not vary significantly (T\u00a0=\u00a01.51, p\u00a0=\u00a00.152, d.f. = 26). Low- and high-quality avulsion-event datasets cover temporal durations that are on average 2.78 kyr and 2.85 kyr, respectively. Rates based on the number of channel threads, instead, are lower on average for datasets classified as \u2018higher quality\u2019 (Fig. 3c, d). For rates based on counts, mean values are 14.3 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a050) and 32.2 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a04), and standard deviations are equal to 25.1 kyr\u22121 and 42.5 kyr\u22121, for high and low-quality datasets respectively; the difference in mean values is not statistically significant (two-sample t-test of log-transformed values: T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.098, d.f. = 52). Corresponding rates normalized by area and river number have mean values of 0.077 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.156 kyr\u22121km\u22122, and standard deviations of 0.193 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.311 kyr\u22121km\u22122, for high and low-quality datasets respectively; the difference in mean values is not statistically significant (two-sample t-test of log-transformed values T\u00a0=\u00a00.31, p\u00a0=\u00a00.760, d.f. = 52). Low- and high-quality channel-thread datasets cover on average 2.81 kyr and 3.38 kyr, respectively. Rates based on delta-lobe counts are higher on average for higher-quality datasets, only for rates that are not normalized (Fig. 3e): mean values of these rates are 7.26 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a016) and 4.14 kyr\u22121 (N\u00a0=\u00a09), and standard deviations are equal to 17.51 kyr\u22121 and 6.68 kyr\u22121, for high and low-quality datasets respectively; the difference in mean values is not statistically significant (two-sample t-test of log-transformed values: T\u00a0=\u00a01.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.317, d.f. = 23). Instead, corresponding rates normalized by area and river number (Fig. 3f) have mean values of 0.017 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.073 kyr\u22121km\u22122, and standard deviations of 0.027 kyr\u22121km\u22122 and 0.156 kyr\u22121km\u22122, for high and low-quality datasets respectively; again, means do not differ significantly (two-sample t-test of log-transformed values T\u00a0=\u00a00.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.493, d.f. = 23). Low- and high-quality delta-lobe datasets have average time windows of 4.02 kyr and 3.60 kyr, respectively.\n\n\n3.2\nRelationships between avulsion-frequency proxies\nRelationships between the three alternative avulsion metrics have been determined to assess the consistency with which they may quantify avulsion frequency and act as proxies for each other. All avulsion metrics are considered as (i) counts per unit time, and as corresponding counts normalized (ii) by area and (iii) by area and number of river systems; hence, nine avulsion metrics are considered overall. The data are presented in Fig. 4\n, and correlations are reported in Table 2\n. Positive and statistically significant correlations are seen between any pair of the three metrics having the same form of normalization, or between their log-transformed equivalent (Fig. 4, Table 2). In general, as expected, river systems for which more frequent avulsion events are recorded tend to be associated with larger numbers of delta lobes and channel threads per unit time; the numbers of channel threads and delta lobes per unit time also tend to correlate positively.\n\n\n3.3\nAvulsion metrics and spatial scales\nRelationships between the alternative avulsion metrics and the size of the study area over which these metrics have been computed have been determined. This analysis provides an assessment of whether the density of avulsion events in coastal-plain river systems varies as a function of spatial scale, on the assumption that the size of the study area is directly proportional to the size of the drainage network that can experience avulsion events. In turn, the results of this analysis can help establish the way in which these metrics can be applied to compare the avulsion histories of different river systems and to study controls on river avulsion. The data are presented in Fig. 5\n, and correlations are reported in Table 3\n. If the spatio-temporal density of avulsion events was independent of river-system size, we would expect some positive correlation between non-normalized avulsion metrics and study-area sizes. On the contrary, however, no significant correlations are seen between study-area size and the numbers per unit time of avulsions, channel threads, or delta lobes, or between their log-transformed equivalents. In view of this, necessarily, negative correlations emerge between the size of the study areas and normalized rates, since these rates are computed with the study-area size as denominator. Negative correlations between log-transformed study-area size and normalized rates are statistically significant. In general, the spatio-temporal densities of avulsion events, channel threads and delta lobes appear to vary with the size of the study area; conversely, avulsion-frequency proxies do not increase systematically as a function of the size of the area being studied.\n\n\n3.4\nAvulsion metrics and timescales\nAn assessment is made of relationships that may exist between the alternative avulsion metrics and the length of time over which they have been computed. This provides a quantification of how avulsion-frequency proxies may vary as a function of their associated time window, either because of geological factors whose influence on coastal river avulsion may have changed through the Holocene, or because of the way the data resolution of avulsion histories may decrease going back in time. The outcomes of this analysis can help inform comparisons of avulsion histories of different river systems and assessments of potential controls on river avulsion. The data are presented in Fig. 6\n, and correlations are reported in Table 4\n. Negative, moderate to strong correlations are seen between log-transformed values of the different avulsion metrics and the timespan on which they are calculated; these correlations are statistically significant when based on the entire available dataset (Fig. 6, Table 4). In general, data relating to shorter time windows tend to yield larger values in the different proxies for avulsion frequency.\nWhen considering relationships between avulsion-frequency metrics and timescale, in view of the results presented earlier (Fig. 5, Table 3), it is useful to determine the possible covariance of temporal and spatial scales of the considered samples. This may arise, for example, because the full extent of each study area reflects in part the amount of shoreline progradation that took place during the studied avulsion history, which is itself a function of the time window being considered. However, only weak positive correlations are seen between study-area size and the timespan of each avulsion metric (for log-transformed data; avulsion events: Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a00.292, p\u00a0=\u00a00.176; channel threads: R\u00a0=\u00a00.286, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03; delta lobes: R\u00a0=\u00a00.262, p\u00a0=\u00a00.206).\n\n\n3.5\nAvulsion metrics and river-system scale\nAn assessment is made of relationships that may exist between avulsion metrics and the size of the river systems, and which may arise because of natural controls on avulsion frequency that are inherently related to scale. Particular consideration is given to attributes of the river system that are known to scale to its size and to act as potential controls on avulsion dynamics: the longstream gradient, the shoreline progradation rate, and the backwater length. The gradient advantages that drive channel avulsion may be expected to be more readily generated by channel-ridge aggradation on alluvial plains where the longitudinal gradient is lower (Slingerland and Smith, 2004), since a stronger contrast between cross-stream and longstream gradients is generated for the same amount of aggradation. Where the river mouth progrades more rapidly, a faster lengthening of the longitudinal profile of the river is associated with a more rapid decrease in longstream gradient, and is expected to be paralleled by faster streambed aggradation; this can again favour the superelevation of channels and the generation of gradient advantages (Jones and Schumm, 1999; Swenson, 2005). Also, avulsion nodes may be expected to be preferentially concentrated near the upstream end of the backwater zone (cf. Chatanantavet et al., 2012); hence, spatial non-uniformity in the distribution of avulsion sites over the study area may reflect: (i) the size of the backwater zone relative to that of the study area over which avulsion metrics are evaluated; and (ii) the magnitude in downdip shift in the backwater limit associated with shoreline progradation and coastal-plain aggradation. The following additional variables are considered as measures of river-system size: the drainage-basin area, the mean yearly water discharge, and the suspended-sediment load. The data are presented in Figs. 7\u20139 and Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2; correlations are reported in Fig. 10.\nAn assessment is made of relationships that may exist between avulsion metrics and the size of the river systems, and which may arise because of natural controls on avulsion frequency that are inherently related to scale.

S1 and S2; correlations are reported in Fig. 10.\n\n\n\n\nAs a preliminary analysis, relationships between the size of the study areas and the size of the river systems are determined for all three avulsion metrics. Positive correlations are seen between log-transformed values of the size of the study areas and the drainage-basin areas of the corresponding river systems (for avulsion events: Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a00.784, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; for channel threads: R\u00a0=\u00a00.805, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; for delta lobes: R\u00a0=\u00a00.793, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the studied deltaic systems, the extension of the study area typically corresponds to the size of the delta; these results therefore reflect the intuition that larger rivers build larger deltas. This must be taken into account in the evaluation of the following results, in light of how avulsion metrics are influenced by the spatial scale over which they are computed (Fig. 5, Table 3).\nIn the selected case studies, as expected, drainage-basin areas correlate inversely with coastal-plain gradients (for log-transformed values: Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.799, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and directly with mean annual discharges (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.837, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No significant relationship is observed between drainage-basin areas and any of the avulsion-frequency metrics based on counts per unit time; moderate negative correlations are seen between the log-transformed values of catchment areas and those of normalized counts per unit time of avulsions (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.522, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), channel threads (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.658, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.706, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S1). A significant, albeit weak, relationship with mean water discharge is seen for the number of channel threads per unit time (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.308, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025); no relationship is seen for corresponding metrics based on avulsion events or delta lobes. Negative relationships are seen between water discharge and normalized metrics based on avulsion events (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.602, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.613, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.769, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, a modest but statistically significant negative relationship is seen between the number of channel threads per unit time and the average coastal-plain gradient (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.341, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), whereas no relationship is seen for corresponding rates based on numbers of avulsions or delta lobes (Fig. 7). Positive relationships are seen between the average gradient and normalized metrics based on avulsion events (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.647, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.532, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.598, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7).\nIn the selected case studies, as expected, drainage-basin areas correlate inversely with coastal-plain gradients (for log-transformed values: Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.799, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and directly with mean annual discharges (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.837, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No significant relationship is observed between drainage-basin areas and any of the avulsion-frequency metrics based on counts per unit time; moderate negative correlations are seen between the log-transformed values of catchment areas and those of normalized counts per unit time of avulsions (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.522, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), channel threads (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.658, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.706, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S1). A significant, albeit weak, relationship with mean water discharge is seen for the number of channel threads per unit time (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.308, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025); no relationship is seen for corresponding metrics based on avulsion events or delta lobes. Negative relationships are seen between water discharge and normalized metrics based on avulsion events (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.602, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.613, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.769, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, a modest but statistically significant negative relationship is seen between the number of channel threads per unit time and the average coastal-plain gradient (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.341, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), whereas no relationship is seen for corresponding rates based on numbers of avulsions or delta lobes (Fig. 7). Positive relationships are seen between the average gradient and normalized metrics based on avulsion events (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.647, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.532, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.598, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Fig. 7).\nIn the chosen case studies, shoreline progradation rates have been evaluated over different timescales, covering three orders of magnitude. Therefore, these rates may plausibly be affected by the Sadler effect, i.e., by timescale dependency due to the fact that local shoreline accretion is unsteady and the average length of interruptions in sedimentation may increase with the length of time being considered (Sadler, 1981; Sadler and Jerolmack, 2015). Indeed, log-transformed values of progradation rates and the times over which they have been evaluated demonstrate some negative correlation (Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.607; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Nevertheless, progradation rates are still more strongly correlated to the rates of sediment supply, through a positive relationship between log-transformed values of progradation rates and total suspended solids in the studied rivers (R\u00a0=\u00a00.675; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, positive relationships are seen between log-transformed values of progradation rates and both catchment size (R\u00a0=\u00a00.577; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and mean annual discharge (R\u00a0=\u00a00.583; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). With regard to the avulsion metrics, statistically significant positive correlations are seen between progradation rates and the counts per unit time of both channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.760; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.526; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017); correlation with the number of avulsion events per unit time is also positive, but modest and not significant (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.303; p\u00a0=\u00a00.271) (Fig. 8). In spite of positive scaling between progradation rates and study-area sizes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.477; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004; N\u00a0=\u00a035), no relationships are seen between progradation rates and normalized avulsion metrics (Fig. 8).\nPositive correlations are seen between log-transformed values of backwater length and those of both mean annual discharge (Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a00.928, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and catchment area (R\u00a0=\u00a00.883, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These relationships are expected, given how the size of a river's backwater zone is scaled to the size of the river system (cf. Blum et al., 2013): estimations of backwater length used in these analyses are based on ratios between estimated mean bankfull depths and average coastal-plain gradients, and may carry significant error (see Section 2.3).\nThe dip extent of the backwater zone of each river system (L\n\nb\n) is considered relative to the dip length of the study area (l) and the estimated amount of coastal-plain progradation that occurred during the timespan of interest (here termed \u2018progradation distance\u2019; D). By assuming, simplistically, that the progradation rate was constant throughout the duration of the characterized avulsion history, the progradation distance is approximated as the product of said rate and the timespan over which each avulsion metric is estimated. Using these quantities, observations are divided into three groups based on (i) whether the dip length of the study area is larger than the backwater length (l\u00a0>\u00a0L\n\nb\n), and (ii) on whether the sum of the backwater length and the progradation distance over the timescale of the avulsion metric in question is larger than the downdip extent of the study area ([D\u00a0+\u00a0L\n\nb\n\n]\u00a0>\u00a0l). This grouping is undertaken to attempt discrimination of examples that can be inferred to embody one of the following situations: (i) a backwater limit permanently within the study area ([D\u00a0+\u00a0L\n\nb\n\n]\u00a0<\u00a0l); (ii) a backwater limit transitioning from outside to inside the study area ([D\u00a0+\u00a0L\n\nb\n\n]\u00a0>\u00a0l and L\n\nb\n\u00a0<\u00a0l); or (iii) a backwater limit permanently outside of the study area (L\n\nb\n\u00a0>\u00a0l). Given the difficulty in constraining values of progradation distance, the dataset associated with each of these groups is, in some cases, very limited in size. Nevertheless, an assessment of differences in the alternative avulsion metrics across the three groups is attempted. Results indicate that values of mean and standard deviation of the avulsion metrics do not vary systematically across the three groups for the three proxies (Table 5\n). Avulsion-frequency metrics based on numbers of avulsion events are highest on average for examples for which the backwater limit is inferred to have been located outside the study area, and smallest for examples for which the limit is inferred to have been always inside. Metrics based on numbers of channel threads are on average highest for case studies for which the backwater limit is inferred to have transitioned from outside to inside the study area, and smallest for those for which the limit is inferred to have been permanently inside. Metrics based on the number of delta lobes are on average highest for examples for which the backwater limit is inferred to have transitioned inside the study area, and smallest for examples for which the limit is inferred to have been permanently outside. Thus, differences in these metrics are not manifested consistently among the three groups. Furthermore, when tested by means of Welch's one-way ANOVA, the means of the considered avulsion metrics do not differ in a statistically significant manner across the three case-study groups for any of the three avulsion metrics; this may however reflect the small sample sizes (Table 5).\nBivariate analyses indicate that no significant correlations are seen between the estimated backwater length and proxies for avulsion frequency based on the number of avulsion events per unit time (for log-transformed values: Pearson R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.212, p\u00a0=\u00a00.332), the number of channel threads per unit time (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a00.214, p\u00a0=\u00a00.145), or the number of delta lobes per unit time (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.093, p\u00a0=\u00a00.689) (Fig. 9). As expected, given these results, backwater lengths yield modest to moderate negative correlations with normalized rates based on avulsion events (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.506, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), channel threads (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.283, p\u00a0=\u00a00.051), and delta lobes (for log-transformed values: R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.500, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) (Fig. 9); these relationships likely reflect covariance between river-system size, study-area size, and backwater length (Fig. 10).\nOverall, factors that quantify the size of the river systems tend to exhibit monotonic relationships with normalized proxies for avulsion frequency, due to covariance between these factors and the size of deltas and of the relative study areas on which normalizations are made; these relationships are expressed consistently across the alternative normalized avulsion proxies (Fig. 10). A notable exception to this is observed in the lack of consistently negative correlations between normalized avulsion metrics and progradation rates, in spite of progradation rates being scaled to the rate of sediment delivery and to catchment size; this reflects the positive correlations between progradation rates and avulsion-frequency metrics that are not normalized by study-area size (Fig. 10).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nHere we discuss the significance of the findings presented above by considering how quantifications of river avulsions are affected by the temporal and spatial scales at which they are determined. We then draw practical implications that may be of use to future studies on river avulsion frequency. Before doing this, we must stress that all observed relationships between the studied avulsion metrics and measures of scale exhibit important scatter: this is expected, since the frequency of channel avulsion is controlled by factors whose importance is not systematically dependent on spatial or temporal scales, such as tectonics (e.g., Reitz et al., 2015), presence of compactable peat substrates (van Asselen et al., 2009), and wave- or tide-driven channel stabilization (cf. Swenson, 2005; Rossi et al., 2016), for example.\n\n4.1\nAvulsion frequency and temporal scales\nRelationships between measures quantifying the frequency of river avulsion and the length of time over which those frequencies are extracted (Fig. 6, Table 4) can be explained by both methodological and geological reasons. A methodological explanation lies in the decreasing resolution of historical, sedimentary and geomorphic records with the age of the events, forms or deposits that they document, due to variations in preservation and data granularity. Alternatively, the same trends may be the result of temporal variations in environmental controls through the Holocene. Since the time windows of almost all datasets are anchored to the present day, apparent trends with time scale may actually represent a record of trends in avulsion dynamics through time. These trends could themselves be linked to temporal changes in sediment supply, water discharge, base level, or marine process regime, through their influences on coastal-plain aggradation, shoreline progradation and river hydrodynamics.\nAmong these factors, the rate of base-level change is perhaps the one that is invoked most commonly as a control on river avulsion, but the way in which relative sea-level changes affect avulsion dynamics is not fully understood. The prevalent view is that the rate of relative sea-level rise may control avulsion frequency by enhancing streambed aggradation, causing the avulsion period to decrease for faster rates of rise (cf. Jerolmack, 2009; Chadwick et al., 2020). Temporal trends in channel-belt avulsion frequency of the Rhine-Meuse delta, for example, have been linked to variations in the rate of sea-level rise accordingly (Stouthamer and Berendsen, 2007; Stouthamer et al., 2011). The negative trends between avulsion-frequency proxies and time length observed across the considered marginal-marine examples cannot however be explained in terms of a direct relationship between rates of eustatic change and avulsion frequency, given the progressive slowdown in the rate of eustatic sea-level rise through the Holocene (Fleming et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2011; M\u00f6rner, 2013; Lambeck et al., 2014). It is nonetheless recognized that avulsions may even become more frequent during slower rates of rise in base level, and that channel superelevation may even be facilitated by relative sea-level falls in some cases (cf. Nijhuis et al., 2015; Lane et al., 2017). The alternative view that an inverse relationship between avulsion frequency and rates of sea-level rise may emerge is corroborated by results of numerical models, demonstrating how in effect sea-level rise may result in distributed and locally reduced channel aggradation, which can hinder the development of avulsion set-up conditions (Moran et al., 2017). Hence, the possibility that the results of our analyses reflect a global record of variations in rates of eustatic change through the Holocene cannot be discounted.\nIt is also recognized that avulsion frequency should scale with the rates of shoreline progradation, in light of the control operated by river-mouth lengthening and the associated shift in the river longitudinal profile on streambed aggradation and gradient reduction; this can cause channel superelevation and the generation of cross-floodplain gradient advantages (Jones and Schumm, 1999; Swenson, 2005; Ratliff et al., 2018). Moreover, channel-mouth progradation can be intimately associated with mouth-bar deposition, which can drive channel aggradation through a morphodynamic backwater effect (Hoyal and Sheets, 2009). However, a tendency of globally increasing shoreline progradation rates through the Holocene, which would explain the results, is at odd with the notion that several of the studied examples have experienced a progressive reduction in sediment supply since the early Holocene (cf. Goodbred Jr and Kuehl, 2000), and with the expected role of autogenic deceleration in progradation during delta growth (Muto and Steel, 1992). The examples used in this study for which time-lapse palaeoshoreline reconstructions are available show that \u2013 when averaged over the timescales of interest \u2013 the rates of progradation typically varied to a limited degree and not systematically, demonstrating a progressive deceleration in shoreline progradation through the considered timespans (e.g., Correggiari et al., 2005b; Fanget et al., 2014; Nooren et al., 2017; Pennington et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020; Nageswara Rao et al., 2020) or only modest acceleration (e.g., Nageswara Rao et al., 2015). It seems therefore unlikely that the observed timescale dependency of avulsion-frequency metrics could reflect temporal variations in progradation rates.\nOther natural controls may be at play, such as climate-related factors affecting rates of sediment delivery and stream power, which themselves control river mobility. Although it is likely that significant spatial variability in the influence of these factors should mask any global Holocene trend, an assessment of their importance requires separate analyses of their relationships with avulsion-frequency metrics, to be undertaken on examples for which these variables can be constrained.\nAnthropogenic factors may also provide a partial explanation of the results. However, a timescale dependency of avulsion frequency is unlikely to be a result of unrecognized human modifications to river drainage networks. Known artificial channel diversions are excluded from our quantifications, and the number of undocumented channel relocations \u2013 which may have been mistreated as avulsions in this study \u2013 is expected to increase for more ancient times, which are more likely to lack historical records. It is possible that human engineering of drainage networks could cause water and sediment rerouting in a manner that would affect the avulsion potential of upstream or downstream reaches, but the way in which this could determine temporal trends observed globally cannot be foreseen. Human controls on sediment delivery and water discharge, meanwhile, are known to have varied geographically and through time in both magnitude and direction (Shi et al., 2002; Oldfield and Dearing, 2003; Erkens et al., 2006; Syvitski and Kettner, 2011; Walling, 2011). An assessment of the possible role of anthropogenic influences on the observed trend requires further analysis, which will rely crucially on the ability to constrain variables describing human pressures on the fluvial systems.\nThe lack of definitive evidence in support of controls by eustatic sea-level rise, shoreline progradation or human intervention may favour a methodological reason, but a conclusive explanation of the dependency of avulsion-frequency metrics on the time over which they are computed is elusive. To elucidate possible factors affecting the temporal variability in avulsion-frequency metrics, more analysis is needed on datasets including the timing of events, palaeochannel activation, and delta-lobe inception: due to paucity of chronometric constraints, this is in most cases not achievable for the chosen datasets, some of which do not even afford the establishment of a complete relative chronology.\n\n\n4.2\nAvulsion frequency and spatial scales\nUnlike with temporal scales, clear trends between study-area size and avulsion metrics based on simple counts of events, channel threads or delta lobes per unit time do not emerge. There are alternative explanations of the fact that non-normalized avulsion-frequency metrics do not vary with spatial scale, and, implicitly, of the fact that inverse correlations between study-area size and normalized proxies are seen.\nThese observations may arise from variability in data quality, whereby smaller-scale studies may afford higher resolution in the definition of avulsion events and drainage networks. We can expect, for example, that a palaeochannel of a certain size that may be mapped on a small fan delta could go unrecognized if occurring on the delta of a large continental-scale river. Nevertheless, based on our classification of datasets on their expected completeness of record, which flags low-quality datasets known as yielding underestimations of avulsion rates, it appears that inherent data variability may not be a major factor in this case. Differences in avulsion-frequency metrics between examples that are classified as lower versus higher quality are limited in magnitude and not consistent across all proxies (Fig. 3).\nIt can alternatively be hypothesized that the inverse proportionality between normalized avulsion rates and study-area size reflects possible correlation between study-area size and the timespan of record (e.g., because longer avulsion histories may be associated with more extensive coastal-plain progradation, resulting in larger coastal-plain areas of interest); yet, no significant relationship is seen between these two variables.\nIn view of this, the lack of relationships between the size of the study areas and the magnitude of the avulsion proxies (and, implicitly, the inverse relations between study-area sizes and normalized avulsion proxies) may indicate that smaller coastal river systems tend to record more frequent avulsions relative to the size of their drainage network. One of the objectives of this work was to determine whether the avulsion frequency of a channel network scales with its extent or with quantities that describe river system size, in relation to potential geological controls on river morphodynamics that are known to vary with scale (cf. Powell et al., 2012; Moran et al., 2017). This does not seem to be the case, overall, if avulsion-frequency proxies that are not normalized are considered. Avulsion metrics based on numbers of events, channel threads or delta lobes do not correlate with explicit measures of river-system size, such as drainage area or mean annual discharge. Correspondingly, normalized avulsion-frequency metrics exhibit negative correlations with the same descriptors of fluvial-system scale, which reflect how the size of the study areas (by which the metrics are normalized) is an indirect measure of the size of the river system.\nIt is possible that this is observed because of spatial non-stationarity in river avulsions on coastal plains, and this is an explanation that aligns with current understanding of the roles of certain geological controls and autogenic dynamics in determining how avulsions operate through lowland channel networks. In particular, avulsions are commonly clustered around avulsion nodes, which may be preferentially located in the proximity of delta apices, because of controls by backwater effects or basin and floodplain topography (Chatanantavet et al., 2012; Hartley et al., 2017; Ratliff et al., 2021). Conversely, channel avulsions may be relatively less common along more distal reaches subject to streambed erosion due to water-surface drawdown hydrodynamics, operating over areas that are also proportional to river-system size (Chatanantavet et al., 2012; Lamb et al., 2012). If most study areas include persistent nodes where avulsions preferentially occur, like those observed at delta apices, and if the number of nodes in a delta and the associated tempo of nodal avulsion are independent of the size of the river system (with which study areas tend to be scaled), considering a study area that extends further downstream of those nodes may result in a variation in counted features (events, channel threads, delta lobes) that is not proportional to the increase in area. It is recognized for example that the size of delta lobes tends to be scaled to the backwater length (Ganti et al., 2016a; Moodie et al., 2019), and hence to river-system size and to the size of the delta itself; this notion is consistent with the presented quantifications of delta-lobe switching frequency. In relation to the supposed importance of backwater hydrodynamics as a cause for non-stationarity in the location of avulsion occurrence, it is also useful to consider the coverage of the study areas relative to the backwater lengths of their associated rivers. In this work, the spatial variability in avulsion frequency that may be linked to backwater processes is only considered by means of some crude analysis, by considering the size and amount of shift of the backwater zone relative to the size of the study area, as a way to determine whether avulsion-frequency metrics may differ within backwater reaches characterized by non-uniform river flow. Results of this analysis indicate that avulsion rates associated with examples inferred to have had a backwater limit permanently outside of the study area are not systematically lower, which would instead be expected if avulsions were less likely in the downstream portion of the backwater zone (Chatanantavet et al., 2012). It must be recognized, however, that the location at which avulsion nodes may preferentially develop along backwater reaches is not well understood. Current research suggests that this location may not coincide with the upstream portion of the backwater zone, and that it may be determined in part by other factors, such as discharge variability and progradation history (Ganti et al., 2016a, 2016b; Moodie et al., 2019; Brooke et al., 2020; Chadwick et al., 2020). To elucidate how backwater processes may have controlled the avulsion histories of Holocene deltas, additional analysis is needed; this would need to leverage on chronometric constraints for both avulsion sites and palaeoshorelines to allow the determination of avulsion lengths (sensu Ganti et al., 2016b).\nThe absence of correlation between study-area size and avulsion-frequency metrics may alternatively reflect the fact that smaller rivers are inherently more avulsive \u2013 in proportion to the extent of their drainage networks \u2013 because of the role of external factors that vary with scale. This idea might clash with current understanding of certain controls on avulsion set-up conditions, notably with the fact that smaller river systems tend to be characterized by steeper streamwise gradients, or by slower river-mouth progradation (Aadland and Helland-Hansen, 2019). Yet, the importance of certain upstream or intrabasinal controls on avulsion triggers and\/or preconditions may vary systematically with the scale of the river system. It is possible, for example, that smaller deltas experience floods that are relatively more conducive to channel avulsion, or exhibit substrate characteristics or dominant morphodynamic behaviours that make their channels more susceptible to diversion. It is known for example that rivers with catchments that are on average smaller tend to be characterized by higher variability in daily water discharge within a year, by higher sediment delivery rates in proportion to their discharge, and by suspended-sediment flux concentrated over comparatively shorter durations (Walling, 1983; Meybeck et al., 2003; Hansford et al., 2020). Some of the studied fan deltas with small, high-relief catchments may have been subject to avulsions driven by channel chocking caused by mass flows (cf. Karymbalis et al., 2010). By contrast, the largest, suspended-load-dominated river systems may be characterized by increased fractions of cohesive sediment in levees and overbank areas, which can stabilize channels and inhibit river avulsion (cf. Edmonds and Slingerland, 2010; Caldwell and Edmonds, 2014). Additionally, in the chosen dataset, several of the smaller river systems tend to be associated with catchments and basins located in tectonically active areas (e.g., river systems of Greece, Taiwan, Philippines), where the influence of seismic triggers to avulsion (e.g., local surface deformation, levee liquefaction, groundwater expulsion; cf. Quigley and Duffy, 2020) can be expected to be higher. To establish whether our observations are determined by any of these potential controls, further analyses need to be undertaken in which these factors are expressly considered.\nOn account of the lack of correlation between study-area size and \u2018pure\u2019 avulsion frequency metrics, and given the relationships between progradation rates, sediment-supply rates, and river-system size, the observed correlations between progradation rates and avulsion-frequency estimations based on channel-thread or delta-lobe counts may be interpreted to support the view that an increase in avulsion frequency may result from faster shoreline progradation (Jones and Schumm, 1999; Swenson, 2005). More rapid progradation does not correspond to higher spatio-temporal density of avulsion events, but this does not necessarily challenge this interpretation, since the size of a study area reflects the scale of the river system, with which avulsion-density metrics correlate negatively overall. Also, any relationships between avulsion metrics and progradation rates may be obfuscated by how some of the studied systems may have undergone progradation under partially forced regressive conditions (e.g., Kazanc\u0131 et al., 2004; Nijhuis et al., 2015). Nevertheless, any inference of how rates of channel-mouth progradation and associated drivers may control avulsion frequency is not strongly supported by data on avulsion-event counts. It must also be considered that higher progradation and sediment-supply rates may be linked to enhanced mouth-bar growth, and hence to a larger number of bifurcations around mouth bars, from which some of the mapped palaeochannels may have evolved.\nIn summary, whether relationships between normalized avulsion-frequency metrics and the scale over which they are determined represent apparent trends due to methodological limitations, or a record of how the behaviour of avulsive channel networks changes in relation to factors that vary with the scale of the river system, cannot be established with confidence solely on the basis of the presented analyses.\n\n\n4.3\nPractical implications\nIf we trust that data quality does not have a major effect on the adopted metrics, relationships between measures of avulsion frequency and the size of the study area over which they are determined provide guidance on the application of these metrics for comparisons of different fluvial systems. A hypothesis was made that \u2013 to facilitate comparisons between different river systems \u2013 rates may need to be normalized by the area over which they have been considered, based on the argument that the size of the study area is proportional to the size of the channel network, such that a larger cumulative length of channel threads that can avulse is sampled. The findings of this work indicate that measures of channel-avulsion frequency may not scale proportionally with the planform extent of the area over which they are evaluated, if the size of that area (e.g., extent of a delta plain) is directly related to the size of the river system. It is also observed that, expectedly, avulsion statistics vary as function of the time window over which they are determined. Hence, quantifications of avulsion frequency or interavulsion period do not seem meaningful in absence of some specification of the temporal and spatial scales over which they have been determined. These considerations should be born in mind when comparing avulsion-frequency proxies of different coastal-plain river systems and over different scales. In attempting to quantify avulsion frequency in a way that enables meaningful comparisons, it is recommended that (i) uncertainties associated with apparent scale dependency are recognized, (ii) alternative integrative approaches are adopted (i.e., simultaneous consideration of raw and normalized avulsion statistics), and (iii) scales of the spatial and temporal samples are explicitly reported.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nAn analysis has been conducted of the avulsion histories of 57 coastal-plain river systems, which have been quantified by means of metrics based on numbers of avulsion events, channel threads and delta lobes; these quantifications have been made with consideration of the size of the study areas and of the number of separate rivers traversing them.\nThese metrics vary with temporal and spatial scales in ways that may be due to both geological and methodological reasons, such as non-uniformity in the way controlling factors operate in space and time, or variations in the resolution of avulsion records with their temporal and spatial extent. Proxies for coastal-plain river avulsion frequency tend to decrease in magnitude as the time window over which they are evaluated increases, likely because of Holocene trends in the importance of avulsion drivers or due to a decrease in the completeness of older avulsion records. Non-normalized avulsion-frequency metrics are not directly related to the size of the area over which they are determined, indicating that smaller deltas tend to record more frequent avulsions in proportion to the extent of their channel networks. This may be an apparent trend due to variations in resolution with the scale of investigation; it may otherwise represent a true emerging characteristic of river deltas, due to non-stationarity in channel avulsion, or to factors acting as avulsion triggers or enablers whose importance varies in relation with river-system scale (e.g., variability in water and sediment discharge, substrate stability).\nMeasures of the spatio-temporal density of avulsion events in coastal-plain fluvial systems vary in relation to spatial and temporal scales, and this has implications on how we quantify and compare the avulsion frequency of lowland rivers.\n\n\nData statement\nA file containing data employed in this paper is included as supplementary material, along with explanation of the data fields.\n\n","91":"","92":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nTerrestrial evaporation (E), defined as total water flux from land to the atmosphere, is one of the most important elements of the global water cycle (Trenberth et al., 2007). Globally, E amounts to two-thirds of the total precipitation over land (Oki and Kanae, 2006), strongly affecting soil water availability, runoff, groundwater, plant photosynthesis, and vegetation growth (Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Moreover, E modulates the atmospheric boundary layer growth during the day, influencing the generation, development, and spatiotemporal propagation of convective storms, heat waves, and droughts (Miralles et al., 2019). Over larger scales, it regulates processes that are paramount for climate behavior, such as the water vapor and cloud feedbacks (Rind et al., 1991). Different components or sources of E are usually considered individually due to their disparate nature: plant transpiration (E\nt), rainfall interception loss (E\ni), and direct evaporation of water from soils (E\ns), water bodies, and snow-covered surfaces. According to satellite-, isotope-, and model-based studies, E is dominated by E\nt at the global scale, with average contributions of E\nt to E typically ranging between 60\u201380% (Fig. 1a) (Jasechko et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2017). At the global scale, the E\n\nt\n flux is \u2248 50.5 103 km3 year-1 (Fig 1a), which is larger than the discharge from all the world\u2019s rivers added together (Dorigo et al., 2021). For this reason, E\nt determines global water availability for human and ecological uses.\nThe different components of E often diverge in their core environmental drivers. E\ns is essentially determined by soil and surface water availability and by the meteorological conditions that dictate atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a), which is the potential of the atmosphere to vaporize water as a function of its radiative (i.e, net solar radiation) and aerodynamic (air temperature, wind speed and air humidity) state. E\ni, in turn, is mainly controlled by the characteristics of rainfall and vegetation structural properties such as leaf area and storage capacity (Teklehaimanot and Jarvis, 1991). The spatial variability in E\nt (Fig. 1b) reflects vegetation density, atmospheric physics (i.e., precipitation and AED), soil water availability, atmospheric CO2 concentration (aCO\n\n2\n), and plant physiological mechanisms (Sitch et al., 2003). There is large inter- and intra-specific varation in plant responses to these environmental conditions due to many interacting biochemical and biophysical processes (Flo et al., 2021), resulting in non-linear positive and negative feedbacks among the different drivers and mechanisms involved (Katul et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2016b).\nDue to its importance for hydrology and climate, it is crucial to evaluate the response of E\nt to ongoing global changes. Our understanding of the degree that different variables and mechanisms drive E\nt remains incomplete, and these potential mechanisms and their influence on E\nt are expected to change as climate changes. Anthropogenic contributions to radiative forcing through increased aCO\n\n2\n are expected to influence precipitation patterns (Dai et al., 2018; Douville et al., 2021) and increase AED (Brutsaert, 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a), and thus affect the frequency and severity of drought events (Cook et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2018). Additionally, enhanced aCO\n\n2\n has complex plant physiological influences, which are interdependent with the radiative effect of aCO\n\n2\n. Thus, it is necessary to conduct an integrated assessment of the influence of aCO\n\n2\n on global E\nt based on both empirical and modeling studies. The mechanisms underlying impacts of increasing aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt involve plant, soil, and atmospheric processes at different scales, i.e. at leaf, plant, and ecosystem scales. Rising aCO\n\n2\n could directly alter leaf stomatal conductance (g\n\ns\n), or change the leaf area and canopy structure, or even influence ecosystems at larger scales as a consequence of changes in water availability and temperature.\nThe challenge to assess all these complex processes and interactions at different spatial scales is amplified by the difficulties to measure E\nt in the field. Different direct and indirect methods exist to derive E\nt, such as partitioning methods based on eddy-covariance (Baldocchi et al., 2001; Nelson et al., 2020) and sapflow measurements (Poyatos et al., 2016), among others (Stoy et al., 2019). These methods are not always comparable and provide spatially fragmented information (Wei et al., 2017). For this reason, model-based approaches using remote sensing and reanalysis data as inputs have been developed in recent years to estimate E\nt. Global studies using these data often suggest that both E and E\nt have increased over the past four decades (Fig. 1c) (Miralles et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). This increase is spatially variable (Fig. 1d) (Swann and Koven, 2017; Zeng et al., 2018) but dominant and consistent with the observed global increase in precipitation (Zhang et al., 2007) and AED (Brutsaert, 2017), and physiological regulation by increasing leaf area (Zeng et al., 2018).\nGiven the large implications for global ecosystems, water resources availability, and the climate system, systematizing the existing uncertainties and the knowledge gaps is an important step to disentangle the complex conundrum related to the influence of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n on global E\nt. Fig. 2\n shows a scheme of the main influences of increased aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt by means of different direct and indirect mechanisms and feedbacks, including both positive (red lines) and negative (blue lines) influences. Fatichi et al. (2016) analyzed the partition of direct and indirect effects of aCO\n\n2\n on E, and concluded these effects tend to compensate each other, with small net E\nt changes expected in wet regions and negligible in semiarid ecosystems. In this study, we review the state of knowledge regarding the interactions and feedbacks among the complex physiological and radiative processes induced by aCO\n\n2\n changes, and their potential contribution to global changes in E\nt.\n\n\n2\nPhysiological and morphological effects of aCO\n\n2\n\n\n\n2.1\nDirect influence of aCO2 on leaf surface conductance\nThe majority of E\nt occurs through the stomatal pores that cover leaf surfaces and regulate the diffusive conductance to water vapor and CO2 (Brodribb and McAdam, 2017). Enhanced aCO\n\n2\n has been shown to reduce g\n\ns\n at the leaf scale (Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007; Ceulemans and Mousseau, 1994), resulting in a larger ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration (i.e. water use efficiency (Norby et al., 1999)); this has been supported by a myriad of experimental studies (Drake et al., 1997; Gimeno et al., 2016; Keel et al., 2006; Long et al., 2004). This influence of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n underlies the predicted reduction of E\nt under enhanced aCO\n\n2\n by the current generation of climate models (Roderick et al., 2015). Projections from Earth System Models (ESMs) have suggested that aridity and drought severity in the future could be ameliorated by the reduction of E\n\nt\n caused by the increased water use efficiency by plants (Berg and McColl, 2021; Berg and Sheffield, 2018; Greve et al., 2019; Lemordant et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2021; Scheff, 2018; Swann, 2018; Swann et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019).\nHowever, the response of g\n\ns\n to aCO\n\n2\n\n\u2013 and the degree to which this effect propagates to global E\n\nt\n \u2013 remains uncertain despite its universal representation in ESMs. According to field studies, the control of g\n\ns\n by aCO\n\n2\n is not homogeneous across world biomes and plant species (Batke et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2013). There are noticeable knowledge gaps in equatorial and tropical biomes, where some experimental studies have shown no sensitivity of g\n\ns\n to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n (Wesolowski et al., 2020), or even a positive response (Purcell et al., 2018). Studies in mid and high latitudes also suggest that mature forests show a much smaller response of g\n\ns\n to aCO\n\n2\n than young trees (K\u00f6rner et al., 2005; Medlyn et al., 2001). Important differences in the g\n\ns\n responses to aCO\n\n2\n have been observed between herbs, shrubs, and trees (Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007), and also between angiosperms and gymnosperms (Brodribb et al., 2009; Klein and Ramon, 2019) have been reported. The average percentage reduction of g\n\ns\n in response to aCO\n\n2\n varies from 50% in dense meadows, to 15% in broadleaved forests, and to less than 10% in coniferous forests (K\u00f6rner et al., 2007). This response is seasonally dependent (Lauriks et al., 2020) and non-linear (Batke et al., 2020; Medlyn et al., 2011), as it tends to saturate for high aCO\n\n2\n, just as CO2 stimulation of photosynthesis saturates (De Kauwe et al., 2021). Moreover, arid vegetation tends to respond in a different manner to aCO\n\n2\n (Zhou et al., 2013), and even increases in g\n\ns\n have been observed under enhanced aCO\n\n2\n in arid plants (Morgan et al., 2004; Pataki et al., 2000).\nThe extent to which the g\n\ns\n response to aCO\n\n2\n is translated to changes in E\nt is still a subject of debate. Some studies argue that this mechanism would substantially reduce E\nt (Leakey et al., 2009), particularly in herbaceous crop landscapes (Bernacchi et al., 2007) and closed forests (Warren et al., 2011). These results suggest soil water savings (Franzaring et al., 2010) and the increase of runoff and other hydrologic pools and fluxes in the future (Betts et al., 2007; Roderick et al., 2015). Nevertheless, there are still important uncertainties as some experimental studies also suggest that the expected reduction of E\nt as consequence of the reduction in g\n\ns\n in response to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n can be as low as 5% for a doubling of aCO\n\n2\n from the preindustrial values (K\u00f6rner et al., 2007; Leuzinger and K\u00f6rner, 2010). Notably, this reduction in E\nt could be mostly limited to seedlings (Lauriks et al., 2020), which are only responsible for a minor component of global E\nt due to their limitations in number and coverage. Moreover, there is growing evidence that the g\n\ns\n response to aCO\n\n2\n may already be close to saturation (Batke et al., 2020). Studies in areas that have not experienced changes in vegetation coverage and precipitation do not show changes in streamflow that would support decreased E\nt in response to aCO\n\n2\n increases in the past decades, or at least would indicate that if aCO\n\n2\n had a negative influence it was overcome by the effect of other drivers such as the increased temperatures (Knauer et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021).\n\n\n2.2\nInfluence of aCO2 on plant morphology\nThe plant morphological changes in response to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n occur at different levels, from the leaf structure to the entire plant. Plants can adapt to increased aCO\n\n2\n by reducing stomatal density of the leaves, which limits maximum g\n\ns\n (Lammertsma et al., 2011). However, the importance of this mechanism under future scenarios of increased aCO\n\n2\n is also highly uncertain (K\u00f6rner, 2017). Recent evidence suggests that it could saturate under elevated aCO\n\n2\n (Garc\u00eda-Amorena et al., 2006; Tricker et al., 2005), while other studies indicate important differences across species and elevation ranges (Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007), including divergent trends, with a positive correlation between stomatal density and aCO\n\n2\n in some species and families (Jordan et al., 2020; Reid et al., 2003). The average reduction in stomatal density in response to elevated aCO\n\n2\n at a global scale appears to be below 5% (Xu et al., 2016a). This makes it unlikely that morphological changes at the leaf level, driven by enhanced aCO\n\n2\n, would significantly nfluence global E\nt trends.\nOther aspects of plant physiology are likely to be more sensitive to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n. In the absence of changes in meteorological drivers or soil moisture content, higher aCO\n\n2\n would promote photosynthesis (A), and increased leaf area and plant growth (McDowell et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020), which is supported by multiple free air CO2 enrichment and chamber experiments (e.g., Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Drake et al., 1997; Mccarthy et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2022). This effect is also not homogeneous across ecosystems: mature forests in moderate rainfall regions have shown small changes in leaf and root mass (Jiang et al., 2020) compared with plant communities located in water limited and transitional areas (Lauriks et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2018).\nAn increase in vegetation coverage and leaf area in response to aCO\n\n2\n is expected to have a direct positive influence on global E\nt (Zeng et al., 2018). Although there are few long-term experiments that combine enriched aCO\n\n2\n and changes in plant coverage, current literature suggests that enhanced vegetation growth could offset, at least partially, the direct influence of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt that is mediated by changes in g\n\ns\n (Duan et al., 2014). The degree to which this happens would vary as a function of vegetation type and characteristics (e.g., mature vs. young forests, wet vs. semiarid ecosystems) (Cheng et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2018; Fatichi et al., 2016; Guerrieri et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2021; Tricker et al., 2005). This assessment is reinforced by several studies in hydrological catchments experiencing increases in plant coverage, which have shown an overall reduction in streamflow as a consequence of enhanced E\nt given more water consumption by vegetation (Filoso et al., 2017; Pe\u00f1a-Angulo et al., 2021; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2021). Thus, although there is evidence of a global increase in plant water use efficiency (WUE) \u2013 defined as the photosynthesis per unit of water transpired (A\/E\nt) \u2013 over recent decades (Mathias and Thomas, 2021; Walker et al., 2020), the enhancement of photosynthesis in response to aCO\n\n2\n seems to be the dominant driver of this WUE increase in comparison to a hypothetical reduction in E\nt in response to aCO\n\n2\n (Adams et al., 2020; Guerrieri et al., 2019; Marchand et al., 2020; Mathias and Thomas, 2021). Finally, aCO\n\n2\n has a noticeable effect on plant root systems, characterized by higher root length and density of fine roots (Iversen, 2010; Nie et al., 2013; Uddin et al., 2018) as consequence of aCO\n\n2\n effects on carbon cycling by means of root respiration and rhizodeposition (Pritarch et al., 2008). This leads to an increase in the capacity of plants to access soil water, which could enhance E\nt, particularly in water limited environments and during periods of surface water stress everywhere. Moreover, higher E\nt as consequence of more developed root systems would manifest above ground through both increased g\n\ns\n and increased leaf area.\nAll these effects of aCO\n\n2\n on plant morphology would suggest a positive influence of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt mediated by higher leaf area and deeper root systems that could counteract the influence of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt mediated by g\n\ns\n (see Sect. 2.1), adding uncertainty and complexity when attempting to predict how aCO\n\n2\n affects E\nt trends. Finally, there can also be impacts of possible limitations related to plant nutrient availability. In particular human-induced reductions in the availability of phosphorous and nitrogen may limit plant A and have been suggested as a constraint on vegetation growth and E\nt (Pe\u00f1uelas et al., 2013; Sardans and Pe\u00f1uelas, 2012), adding a new layer of complexity when assessing the integral influence of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt.\n\n\n\n3\nRadiative effects of aCO\n\n2\n\n\n\n3.1\nImpacts of aCO\n\n2\n driven by changes in temperature, atmospheric demand and water availability\nThe direct and indirect physiological and plant morphological effects of aCO\n\n2\n described above overlap with the influence that enhanced aCO\n\n2\n has on AED and soil water deficit (Xu et al., 2013). Near-surface air temperature will increase in the future globally (IPCC, 2021), while, over land, relative humidity (RH) is expected to decrease (Byrne and O\u2019Gorman, 2018). Precipitation is projected to increase on average, although with large spatial variability and projected declines in many subtropical regions (IPCC, 2021); meanwhile, periods of precipitation deficits are expected to be longer worldwide (Pendergrass et al., 2017).\nChanges in temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is the difference between the actual and the saturation vapor pressure of the air, are strongly relevant for E\nt, not only as drivers of AED, but also as modulators of the direct influence of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n (Leuzinger and K\u00f6rner, 2007). Plants respond to increasing VPD through reductions in g\n\ns\n (Grossiord et al., 2020; Medlyn et al., 2001). As for most physiological responses, the effect of VPD on g\n\ns\n is strongly dependent on species (K\u00f6rner et al., 2007; Sinclair et al., 2017), xylem and leaf characteristics (Klein, 2014; Martins et al., 2016), and plant height (Lansu et al., 2020). Nevertheless, although high VPD causes a reduction in g\n\ns\n, this effect is not generally strong enough to prevent a net increase in E\nt, due to the increased AED, in most vegetation types (Grossiord et al., 2020; Massmann et al., 2019; Sinclair et al., 2017). E\nt is thought to show a linear response to VPD in the low VPD range, but follows a saturation curve at high VPD values (Beer et al., 2009; Grossiord et al., 2020; Motzer et al., 2005). It is necessary to consider the joint influences of changes in VPD and aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt. Existing studies based on chamber and free-air CO2 enrichment experiments in forests and grasslands suggest that the potential enhanced E\nt caused by increases in VPD could counteract potential E\nt reductions linked to stomatal response to aCO\n\n2\n and VPD itself (Hasper et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2011), and that aCO\n\n2\n-driven effects in g\n\ns\n and E\nt could be only relevant at conditions of low AED (Leuzinger and K\u00f6rner, 2007), basically during periods in which a low E\nt is recorded and when the net effects of aCO\n\n2\n would be less relevant. This suggests a dominance of the potential effects of VPD on E\nt over the direct influence of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt via g\n\ns\n (Duan et al., 2014; Hasper et al., 2016; Jiao et al., 2019).\nThere are large uncertainties in the response of vegetation to VPD in tropical regions, which are strongly relevant for global E\nt. In these areas, although g\n\ns\n also shows high sensitivity to VPD variations (Ghimire et al., 2018; Kosugi et al., 2012; Mendes and Marenco, 2017; Slot and Winter, 2017), the vast majority of experimental studies show a net positive response of E\nt to VPD (Granier et al., 1996; Igarashi et al., 2015; McJannet et al., 2007; Siddiq et al., 2017; Siddiq and Cao, 2016; Vourlitis et al., 2008; Wallace and McJannet, 2010; Yoshifuji et al., 2020), and although there are important differences among the different forest types of these regions (Gotsch et al., 2016; Grossiord et al., 2019; McJannet et al., 2007), only a few studies suggest a near neutral response (Fang et al., 2021; Marenco et al., 2014). Thus, it is suggested that in wet equatorial forests E\nt is mainly driven by variations of climate, but tropical forests characterised by a dry season, would show a more dominant role of g\n\ns\n on E\nt (Costa et al., 2010).\nAlthough several uncertainties remain, most studies based on controlled experiments support the hypothesis that under a strong increase in VPD \u2013 such as observed in recent decades and projected in the future due to the radiative forcing induced by aCO\n\n2\n \u2013 global E\nt would primarily be controlled by elevated AED. This conclusion is consistent with observational studies, since the changes in precipitation (Liu et al., 2021) and the increase in AED (Brutsaert, 2017; Miralles et al., 2014) have been suggested as the dominant drivers of the estimated E\nt increase over the last two decades.\nMoreover, the effect of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt is also dependent of soil water availability. Some studies in mid and high latitudes have suggested that soil water availability has a stronger influence on E\nt than the physiological effects of aCO\n\n2\n (Hasper et al., 2016; Leuzinger and K\u00f6rner, 2010). Under low soil moisture, the effect of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n is small (Naumburg et al., 2003; Pataki et al., 2000), since water deficits exert a larger control on g\n\ns\n and on whole-plant hydraulic conductance (Bourbia et al., 2021; Grossiord et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2016b). Moreover, the relative impact of rising aCO2 and water availability on E\nt differ among species depending on plant water use strategy (Mart\u00ednez-Vilalta et al., 2014). Decreasing diffusive and hydraulic conductance in response to drying soils and increased AED has significant implications for A and plant mortality (see Section 3.2). Under such water stress, enhanced aCO\n\n2\n is less likely to increase water use efficiency and influence E\nt (Duan et al., 2014; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2016a).\nThere are other relevant plant processes associated with the radiative effects of aCO\n\n2\n. First is the increase in the length of plant vegetative periods as a consequence of temperature rise, a phenomenon already observed in recent decades (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003) and that may contribute to enhancing E\nt (Zhang et al., 2020). In water-limited regions, this phenomenon would have limited implications on total E\nt as it is mostly controlled by water availability driven by precipitation, but it can affect its seasonality (Lemordant et al., 2016). On the other hand, in humid regions, in which E\nt is usually not constrained by water availability, longer vegetative periods can increase E\nt (Frank et al., 2015; Lian et al., 2020). This issue must be fully considered to assess E\nt scenarios as mechanistic models suggest a dominant role of this factor to explain the net increase of E\nt under climate change in cold humid regions (Kirschbaum and Mcmillan, 2018).\nFinally, a potentially relevant influence of aCO\n\n2\n radiative effects on E\nt is that they increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme heat episodes (Seneviratne et al., 2014). Extreme temperatures have been reported to cause heat stress and stomatal closure, leading to a decline in both A and E\nt (Grossiord et al., 2020). However, there is evidence that high temperature causes stomata to depart from their normal water-conserving behaviour, increasing gs apparently to provide evaporative cooling to the leaf (Drake et al., 2018; Urban et al., 2017). This would explain that during periods of extreme heat and if water is available, rates of E\nt far exceeding typical values have also been recently reported, and suggested as a last resort against overheating (Chaves et al., 2016; Drake et al., 2018; Krich et al., 2022). Moreover, during periods of low g\n\ns\n such as in dry and hot conditions, an increase in leaf cuticular conductance with temperature causes an increase of E\nt from leaf tissues (Schreiber, 2001). Although cuticular conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than g\n\ns\n (Riederer, 2006), it increases exponentially with temperature (Schreiber, 2001; Slot et al., 2021), even in plants that are well adapted to temperature extremes (Bueno et al., 2019). The impact of higher cuticular and stomatal water loss under anomalously high temperature are not considered in contemporary ESMs, but have the potential to largely affect E\nt at high temperature and threaten plant survival during extreme heat (Brodribb et al., 2020). These processes involving extreme heat will gain importance in a warmer world, and should be fully considered when assessing global E\nt projections.\n\n\n3.2\nEffects of aCO\n\n2\n on E\n\nt\n caused by increased forest mortality and wildfires\nPeriods of precipitation deficits, soil dryness, and enhanced AED render the role of aCO\n\n2\n in g\n\ns\n as secondary in importance (Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2016b). In both dry and energy-limited regions, vegetation tends to be negatively affected by water deficits (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2013). Thus, an increase in forest mortality due to drought, insect outbreaks (Anderegg et al., 2013; Brodribb et al., 2020), and forest fires (Holden et al., 2018) have been recorded in response to enhanced heat, AED and more severe droughts associated to increased aCO\n\n2\n. Under future climate projections, more frequent plant mortality episodes in both dry and humid regions are projected (McDowell et al., 2016; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019). In this regard, the benefits of aCO\n\n2\n on plant productivity could be offset, or even lead to a negative net effect, if enhanced aCO\n\n2\n promoted plant phenotypes that are less resilient to water stress (Bobich et al., 2010), thereby increasing the vulnerability to drought (Anderegg et al., 2019). Moreover, in response to increased CO2 forcing and the associated drying and warming, wildfire events are expected to be more frequent and affect larger areas (Schoennagel et al., 2017; Scholten et al., 2021). The consequences of changes in vegetation coverage associated with enhanced tree mortality and more frequent and severe forest fires for future E\nt is uncertain, and observational studies strongly differ as a function of site characteristics, vegetation type and age, and climate (Goeking and Tarboton, 2020; Zhang and Wei, 2021).\nAfter large-scale tree mortality, not only E\nt, but also E\ni, E\ns, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation are affected (Adams et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2021) (Fig. 3\n). E\nt is usually reduced immediately after tree mortality and forest fires given the disappearance of the dominant vegetation (Anderegg et al., 2016), although the effects of both phenomena may differ, as forest fires usually affect understory vegetation and soil characteristics (Certini, 2005), leading to more intense and persistent effects on E\nt (Dore et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2020). After such a disturbance, the partitioning between E\nt and E\ns is strongly altered; E\ns can be dominant, increasing by more than 50% in comparison to previous vegetation stages (Biederman et al., 2014; Raz-Yaseef et al., 2010). Thus, in some particular cases an overall increase of total evaporation (E) in response to plant mortality has been documented (Biederman et al., 2015; Morillas et al., 2017) and this has been attributed not only to the increase of E\nt by the understory vegetation after tree mortality (Bennett et al., 2018), but also to the increase of E\ns as a consequence of higher available energy, since the ground is not shaded by canopies (Biederman et al., 2014) and trees do not consume this extra energy as they transpire. Forest fires also change the albedo and aerodynamic conductance, which could dramatically alter E (Liu et al., 2019). It is necessary to stress that any given ecosystem operates within the continuum of energy to water limited circumstances, leading to energy budget balancing E\ns for E\nt in more semi-arid systems, that causes less than expected increases in post-disturbance runoff (Adams et al., 2012; Biederman et al., 2015; Goeking and Tarboton, 2020).\nAbrupt plant changes as consequence of forest mortality and wildfires impose additional uncertainties on the future E\nt trends. On the one hand, herbs usually colonize first the areas affected by disturbances, and although they have lower leaf area and shallower roots than forests, they show a stronger sensitivity of g\n\ns\n to aCO\n\n2\n in comparison to forests (see Section 2.1), and they tend to have a higher E\nt per leaf area than tress species under well-watered conditions (Wang et al., 2019). This suggests that E\nt in the new vegetation coverage could be more affected by the direct physiological influence of increased aCO\n\n2\n. On the other hand, increased radiative effects associated with enhanced aCO\n\n2\n are likely to be more relevant resulting in more E in the colonizing vegetation in comparison to the pre-disturbance conditions. Specifically, in semiarid forests, E does not usually change in response to tree mortality and forest fires (Adams et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2018; Huxman et al., 2005) since the generation of runoff and groundwater is low, and the role of the changes in vegetation coverage in the partition between E\nt and E\ns is of less relevance for the total E (Tsamir et al., 2019). For this reason, if semiarid areas expanded globally (Huang et al., 2016a), total E would decrease as a consequence of reduced water availability, but the ratio E\ns\/E would certainly increase, making total E less sensitive to the direct and indirect physiological effects of aCO\n\n2\n that affect E\nt.\nA final important source of uncertainty is related to how vegetation recovers after a disturbance. Most observational studies have shown that E\nt recovers gradually after tree mortality and forest fires, due to the regeneration and growth of the remaining vegetation (Adams et al., 2012; Anderegg et al., 2016; Bearup et al., 2014; Dore et al., 2012). In fact, there are studies that suggest a temporary increase of E\nt in relation to pre-disturbance conditions (Anderegg et al., 2016). Plant recovery depends on different factors, including plant communities, soil quality, average climate, etc. (Morris et al., 2011; Mou et al., 1993) (Fig. 3), so while regeneration may be quick and E\nt may recover rapidly under mesic and warm conditions (Kelly et al., 2020), in colder or arid climates, in which the regeneration is slow, the effects of the disturbance on E\nt can prolong for decades (Adams et al., 2012). The effect of the interactions between the different species that colonize the forests can be also relevant, as the overall response of ecosystem E\n\nt\n is controlled by the diversity of hydraulic functional traits and the response of distinct plant functional groups (Anderegg et al., 2018, 2019; Werner et al., 2021), as well as competition and facilitation among different species for water (Grossiord, 2020; Grossiord et al., 2014). Moreover, after the disturbance, dominant species may be replaced by others with different hydraulic strategies (Batllori et al., 2020). The most extreme cases are related to the occurrence of landscape degradation after a disturbance, as a consequence of soil or climate limitations for plant recovery (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b). In these cases, the change in the magnitude of E and in the partition between E\nt and E\ns in relation to the pre-disturbance conditions can be dramatic as soils become more exposed to radiation (Raz-Yaseef et al., 2010). A representative example of this phenomenon is the case of shrub encroachment, where E\nt is restricted to plant patches that are islands of soil humidity (Reynolds et al., 1999) surrounded by soils where surface moisture is depleted by E\ns (Huxman et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n4\n\nE\nt simulation in Earth Surface Models\n\nE\nt is represented in the ESMs by modeling complex biophysical and biochemical processes including multiple feedbacks (Flato et al., 2013). The Monin\u2013Obukhov Similarity Theory provided the original equations to calculate E in ESMs, as the sum of E\ns, E\nt, and E\ni, calculating each component independently relative to the specific humidity gradient between surface and near-surface atmosphere based on resistances to evaporation due to turbulent transfer, moisture limitations, and additionally for E\nt, stomatal physiology (Monin and Obukhov, 1954). These basic equations have evolved in current ESMs and the modelling of E\ns, E\nt and E\ni is now more complex and requires a number of resistances, which are connected in serial and\/or parallel. How many resistances are used and how they are parameterized in the solution of the energy budget depends on the specific ESM, but current schemes incorporate biogeochemical and ecological processes when estimating these water, energy and carbon fluxes (Christoffersen et al., 2016; Sellers et al., 1997; Wullschleger et al., 2014).\n\n4.1\nInfluence of aCO2 on Et according to Earth Surface Models\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects Phase 5 and Phase 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) simulations by ESMs forced with future scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations suggest that global changes in E\nt could be limited because the modelled physiological effect of aCO2 on g\n\ns\n offsets other factors (Fowler et al., 2019; Milly and Dunne, 2016; Roderick et al., 2015; Scheff, 2018; Swann et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019), particularly under high CO2 scenarios. This assessment could have strong implications for future hydrology (Lemordant et al., 2018; Scheff, 2018; Yang et al., 2019), and limit the increase in aridity (Berg and McColl, 2021; Lian et al., 2021) and drought severity (Berg and Sheffield, 2018; Scheff, 2018).\nOther modeling suggest that E\nt has increased in the last few decades, particularly as a consequence of the dominant increase of the leaf area and global warming, and show just a small influence of the effects of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n (Cernusak et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). There are also model studies that predict an increase of E\nt in future scenarios as a consequence of the increases in A and leaf area and longer growing seasons, suggesting that runoff would decline in large areas of North America, Europe and the Amazon as consequence of enhanced plant water consumption (Mankin et al., 2018, 2019).\nNonetheless, future projections of leaf area and vegetation coverage are affected by strong uncertainties (De Kauwe et al., 2021; Park and Jeong, 2021; Song et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020). Based on 16 CMIP5 models for the RCP8.5 scenario, Mankin et al. (2019) suggested that reduced E\nt by the direct physiological effects of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n could have only a small effect on runoff, since it would affect areas that are already humid (as equatorial biomes) (Franks et al., 2017; Park et al., 2020), while in the vast majority of mid-latitudinal semiarid and sub-humid regions, E\nt would increase in response to higher leaf area and AED.\n\nFig. 4\n compares the E\nt estimates of CMIP6 models based on three different experiments: (a) 1pctCO2, which represents the effects of CO2 increases at a rate of 1% per year until quadrupling of the preindustrial concentrations considering coupled CO2 effects in both carbon cycle and radiation; (b) 1pctCO2-bgc, which represents 1% per year increasing CO2 coupled to the carbon-cycle while radiative forcing is kept at the preindustrial CO2 and (c) 1pctCO2-rad, which represents 1% per year increasing CO2 coupled to the radiation forcing while the carbon cycle responds to the preindustrial CO2. We analyzed the simulated E\nt s considering aCO\n\n2\n from 285 to 1136 ppm, which correspond to the aCO\n\n2\n for preindustrial (1850) and SSP5-85 emissions scenario for 2100, respectively. The models used are BCC-CSM2-MR, CanESM5, CanESM5-CanOE, CESM2, CMCC-ESM2, CNRM-ESM2-1, GFDL-ESM4, GISS-E2-1-G, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC-ES2L, MRI-ESM2-0 and UKESM1-0-LL.\nThe analysis of the E\nt projections in the recent CMIP6 models show a general agreement in the spatial patterns of annual E\nt (Fig. 4a) with the E\nt estimated from the remote sensing-based approach showed in Fig. 1b, although the average values obtained from the models tend to be lower.\nThere are important differences between the experiments 1pctCO2-bgc and 1pctCO2-rad in the projections of E\nt for 2050 and 2100 (Fig. 4b). The 1pctCO2-bgc experiment isolates the effect of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n in the carbon cycle and it shows a general decrease of the annual E\nt (Figs. 4c and d) for aCO\n\n2\n corresponding to the SSP5-85 scenario by 2050 and 2100. The main decrease of E\nt is recorded in humid tropical and equatorial regions. These regions show an increase of the leaf area in CMIP6 projections (Zhao et al., 2020) and they are characterised by sufficient availability of water to supply the needs of the vegetation canopy, so the results of the 1pctCO2-bgc experiment in these areas suggest clear dominance of the role of aCO2 on g\n\ns\n in explaining the E\nt projections in comparison to the enhancement of E\nt as consequence of higher leaf area. In mid-latitudinal areas of Europe and North America, leaf area is also projected to increase, but the dominant E\nt decrease in the 1pctCO2-bgc experiment in these areas suggests a dominance of the g\n\ns\n decline in ESMs.\nThe projections of the 1pctCO2-rad experiment, which isolates the effect of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n on the radiative forcing, show dominant global increase of E\nt, which would affect mid-latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, central Africa and southeast Asia. Exceptions are the Mediterranean, southern North America, southern Africa, Australia and Amazonia, in which CMIP6 models project a decrease of precipitation (Douville et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021), which would limit the available water for transpiration. In the rest of the regions, characterized by sufficient soil moisture content, the strong projected increase of AED would enhance E\nt (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a).\nThe coupled influences of enhanced aCO\n\n2\n in both carbon cycle and radiative forcing (1pctCO2 experiment) show small global changes in average E\nt. Nevertheless, there are important spatial differences with a dominant E\nt increase over most of Eurasia and North America, Southern South Africa, and East Asia that suggest the dominance of radiative influences, and dominant decrease in Amazonia, central and southern Africa, southern Europe and southeast Asia, which would be related to the effects of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n, and the projected reduction of precipitation in some areas (Douville et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021).\nIt is difficult to assess the accuracy of these projections, although the general increase observed in the experiment 1pctCO2-rad qualitatively agrees with observational studies based on recent decades, which have reported positive E\nt trends following global warming (Brutsaert, 2017; Miralles et al., 2014). In any case, it is worth mentioning that the agreement between models in the projections of carbon cycle influences on E\nt is weaker than agreement in the influence of radiative forcing. The projections of the 1pctCO2-bgc experiment show larger spread among the models and notably this problem propagates to the coupled experiment 1pctCO2, adding more uncertainty to the projections. This problem is not new: radiative effects associated with enhanced aCO\n\n2\n were also more consistent than the physiological effects across CMIP5 ESMs (Gentine et al., 2019). These results suggest that the difficulties of establishing a robust assessment of future E\nt mostly relate to the inherent uncertainties in the modeling of plant processes by ESMs. This reflects our limited process understanding and model representation of the direct and indirect physiological and morphological effects of aCO\n\n2\n and their connection with the radiative effects of aCO\n\n2\n reviewed above, and other relevant physical processes (such as atmospheric turbulence or root access to secondary water resources).\n\n\n4.2\nUncertainty in gs formulations in Earth System Models\nOf particular concern is the fact that the direct physiological mechanisms linking aCO\n\n2\n and dynamic responses of the stomata (and hence g\n\ns\n) are poorly understood, yet very influential in current climate model projections of E\nt (Franks et al., 2017). This applies both to the response of stomatal aperture (Saxe et al., 1998) as well as stomatal density to aCO\n\n2\n (Konrad et al., 2008). A key source of uncertainty relates to how ESMs determine g\n\ns\n based on semi-empirical approaches that combine A, CO2 and RH or VPD (Ball et al., 1987; Medlyn et al., 2017) and use parameters related to the vegetation type that are often poorly constrained (Medlyn et al., 2011). These parameters exhibit a significant spread in the measurements from different methods (e.g. using leaf gas exchange, leaf isotopes, eddy covariance towers) (Medlyn et al., 2017). Stomatal physiology and soil-to-leaf water transport properties (e.g., xylem hydraulic conductance) vary widely among species (Brodribb and Feild, 2010; Xu et al., 2016a). Moreover, the structure of the model used to calculate g\n\ns\n adds another source of uncertainty. All these semi-empirical models provide a similar sensitivity of g\n\ns\n to aCO\n\n2\n, which often does not capture the range of variability in observations (Medlyn et al., 2017). Moreover, still several ESMs use g\n\ns\n models based on RH instead of VPD (Knauer et al., 2015) despite strong evidence that stomata respond to VPD (Aphalo and Jarvis, 1991; Oren et al., 1999). This is not a trivial choice and it has important implications in the projections of plant E\nt since in the nature g\n\ns\n is linked to VPD through hydraulic conductance (Brodribb and McAdam, 2017). Thus, VPD-based models may lead to up to 10% higher WUE than models using RH (Sato et al., 2015), with the latter yielding a poorer performance when comparing g\n\ns\n estimates with observations (Raczka et al., 2016). In addition, parameterizations used by these models noticeably alter the relationship between g\n\ns\n and aCO\n\n2\n (Franks et al., 2017). Using satellite-based estimates, Forzieri et al. (2020) suggested that E\nt in ESMs could be oversensitive to the effects of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n (see Section 2.1). More mechanistic models of g\n\ns\n (e.g., Buckley, 2019) would be needed to capture different sensitivities to aCO\n\n2\n, but current models have not been tested for this aspect. In the 42 different CMIP6 models listed by Zhou et al. (2022), 7 of them do not use a g\n\ns\n model, 24 use the Ball-Berry (Ball et al., 1987), 5 the Leuning (Leuning, 1995), 3 the JULES (Clark et al., 2011) semi-empirical models, and only 3 models use a semi-mechanistic g\n\ns\n model (Knauer et al., 2015); this means that the vast majority of ESMs still use uncertain semi-empirical g\n\ns\n models for this purpose.\nThis model uncertainty in the effect of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n can be relevant to determine E\nt trends in some regions. The reduction of E\nt in dense mature equatorial and tropical forest areas seen in CMIP5 models (Fig. 4b) (Lemordant et al., 2018; Park et al., 2020), which suggests substantial direct physiological influences of aCO\n\n2\n on g\n\ns\n, could contradict experimental studies that have exhibited low sensitivity of g\n\ns\n to elevated aCO\n\n2\n in dense mature humid forests (K\u00f6rner et al., 2005; Medlyn et al., 2001; Saxe et al., 1998) and dry tropical forests (Purcell et al., 2018; Wesolowski et al., 2020). Although these results may not be fully representative of the behavior in tropical and equatorial forests in which there are very few experiments, a recent meta-analysis on the drivers of WUE change in dense mature forests in different world regions, including some tropical forests, suggested that g\n\ns\n did not change substantially between 1901 and 2015 in response to aCO\n\n2\n increase (Mathias and Thomas, 2021). These observations suggest that the reduction of E\nt projected by the ESMs associated to a reduced g\n\ns\n in these areas may be affected by uncertainties, even more considering the high sensitivity of E\nt to VPD increase observed experimentally there (Granier et al., 1996; Igarashi et al., 2015; McJannet et al., 2007; Siddiq et al., 2017; Siddiq and Cao, 2016; Vourlitis et al., 2008; Wallace and McJannet, 2010; Yoshifuji et al., 2020). In semiarid and sub-humid regions in which E\nt is limited by water availability, and in cold regions in which E\nt is limited by energy, there is more consensus that any potential control of g\n\ns\n by aCO\n\n2\n would have a limited influence on E\nt (Lemordant et al., 2018; Park et al., 2020; Skinner et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.3\nOther physiological uncertainties in Earth System Models\nThe uncertainty in the modeling of the relevant plant\u2013water processes is not restricted to the estimation of g\n\ns\n. Most ESMs do not explicitly consider the entire water transport across the soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere continuum. Plant hydraulics is one of the most relevant mechanisms that regulate the whole-plant physiology (McDowell et al., 2019) and only recently have some models included it in their formulations (Kennedy et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). This is a substantial limitation, since water transport determines plant hydration and is thus a core driver of plant performance and plant\u2013atmosphere responses (Brodribb et al., 2020; Choat et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2020) showed that in comparison to the use of a plant hydraulic model, the estimates of g\n\ns\n currently included in most ESMs produce a low sensitivity of E\nt to VPD, which is compensated by the overestimation of the sensitivity of E\nt to soil moisture (Liu et al., 2020; Powell et al., 2013). This aspect could limit the assessment of the relationships between these three variables in the ESM projections for future climate scenarios under chronically increasing VPD. Moreover, the relationships used by ESMs to relate plant gas exchange and soil water availability do not consider the complex differences in the response to drought among different plant types (De Kauwe et al., 2021; Medlyn et al., 2016). This is still an issue that is poorly investigated, and in which allometric adjustment between roots and leaves in response to aCO\n\n2\n seems to play an important role (Hao et al., 2018). Thus, root density and depth, which are strongly affected by aCO\n\n2\n (See section 2.2), and the access to groundwater, are also important sources of uncertainty for a correct assessment of plant\u2013water interactions in the climate models. ESMs do not include other relevant plant\u2013water mechanisms such as the increase of the leaf cuticular conductance associated with warming conditions and the possible decoupling between A and E\nt in response to extreme heat (See section 3.1).\nThe limitations of ESMs to estimate E\nt are not only related to how they represent plant\u2013water interactions. The interaction between plant growth and mortality and aCO\n\n2\n in ESMs is also very relevant, and the magnitude and projected changes in A, plant coverage, and leaf area are important to interpret E\nt projections. ESM projections of E\nt portray a dominant increase of leaf area (Mahowald et al., 2016), which would support also a net increase in E\nt in response to greening (Cernusak et al., 2019; Filoso et al., 2017; Mankin et al., 2019). Nevertheless, leaf area projections by ESMs are affected by strong uncertainties (De Kauwe et al., 2021; Park and Jeong, 2021; Song et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020), and E\nt modeling in ESMs is less sensitive to changes in the leaf area index than in g\n\ns\n (Cernusak et al., 2019; Forzieri et al., 2020). These two factors are also introducing important uncertainties in the ESM projections of E\nt since ESMs would tend to underestimate a possible effect of a hypothetical and uncertain greening on E\nt. Thus, the low sensitivity of E\nt to changes in leaf area in ESMs could explain some E\nt underestimation by ESMs (Dong et al., 2022; Mankin et al., 2019), which could be primarily attributed to the inaccurate representation of light distribution in the canopy (Lian et al., 2018), and to problems modeling water uptake by roots (Lawrence et al., 2007; Lian et al., 2018), both issues being strongly related to aCO\n\n2\n (See section 2.2). In any case, how resistances are parameterized in models may be relevant, since the ratio of E\nt to E is simulated much more realistically in models based on mechanistic principles (Decker et al., 2017; Paschalis et al., 2018).\nCurrent ESMs do not factor in the likelihood of plant mortality episodes in response to climate extremes induced by CO2 radiative forcing (See section 3.2), and as not all the models include a dynamic change of vegetation coverage with plant competition (Huang et al., 2016b), they cannot account for the role of relevant plant processes as secondary succession, replacement of species, drought-induced tree mortality, land degradation, etc., which are expected to be strongly affected by radiative effects of aCO\n\n2\n (See section 3.2). Also, possible changes in plant functional traits in response to climate change can be essential to evaluate how E\nt is affected by aCO\n\n2\n (Anderegg et al., 2019; Anderegg et al., 2016), but they are also not accurately considered in the current generation of ESMs (Fisher et al., 2018; Wullschleger et al., 2014).\nIn summary, the coupled physiological and radiative mechanisms involved in E\nt under enhanced aCO\n\n2\n are poorly understood, which limits their accurate representation in ESMs. Likewise, physiological processes in ESMs are also subject to important simplifications (De Kauwe et al., 2021; Forkel et al., 2019; Green et al., 2020; Manusch et al., 2012). These limitations cause not only uncertainties in the magnitude of E\nt (De Kauwe et al., 2013) but even in the sign of E\nt trends (Knauer et al., 2017). ESMs still need improvement in representing complex interacting processes including changes in climate, plant coverage and physiology and human land and water management to confidently simulate future E\nt trends in response to aCO\n\n2\n changes, but gaps in understanding many of the complex processes limit progress in modeling.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions and future research perspectives\n\nE\nt is one of the most relevant variables determining water budget over continental areas, and affecting temperature and precipitation, while modulating critical climate processes such as the cloud, lapse rate and water vapour feedback. Nevertheless, there are strong uncertainties in understanding its complex dynamics. There is a large debate on how E\nt may change in future scenarios with strong implications for soil moisture, runoff availability, aridity, drought severity, etc. The role of aCO\n\n2\n on E\nt is a key source of uncertainty. In this review, we have addressed the direct and indirect mechanisms and feedbacks that mediate the complex interaction between aCO\n\n2\n and global E\nt changes. E\nt is determined by different physiological and radiative effects of aCO\n\n2\n, including feedbacks with water availability, climate, and vegetation dynamics, which are often coupled. Our literature review shows that frequently CO2-induced changes (decreased g\n\ns\n, increased LAI, higher AED, altered soil moisture, etc.) influence E\nt in opposite directions, which makes the overall sensitivity highly uncertain. Plant behavior is particularly divergent across vegetation types and environmental conditions, and these differences may not be well represented in our models due to uncertainty in our understanding of these processes (Fig. 5\n).\nDifferent research priorities are necessary to improve empirical measurements and modelling to improve our knowledge of E\nt dynamics and its possible response to rising CO2. To advance our knowledge of the global E\nt response to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n, reinforcing the network of E\nt observations over different regions should be a priority (Beven et al., 2020; Poyatos et al., 2016; Stoy et al., 2019). However, it is necessary to stress that given the uncertainty of E\nt measurements from different sources (sapflow measurements, eddy covariance towers, water budgets at the basin scale), dedicated and controlled experiments to observe E\nt precisely would be needed, and better methodologies for upscaling these observations also need to be developed. Likewise, continuing the efforts to derive E\nt estimates from the current and future wealth of satellite observations must remain in the agenda (Fisher et al., 2017). International efforts and coordination are necessary, and international programs such as the World Integrated Global Observing System of the World Meteorological Organization should promote E\nt observation as one of the main points in climate observation; along those lines, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) has recently included E\nt among the list of Essential Climate Variable (ECV) products (Dorigo et al., 2021).\nTo better understand the direct plant physiological response to enhanced aCO\n\n2\n is another priority. Of particular importance is to improve our understanding of the response of g\n\ns\n to aCO\n\n2\n-induced warming. For this reason, controlled experimental studies should address the joint contribution of direct and indirect physiological and radiative aCO\n\n2\n influences for different vegetation types and environmental conditions. These coupled processes may generate complex spatial mosaics in which it can be very difficult to assess possible E\nt changes. In addition, the assessment of the role of vegetation dynamics related to climate change on global E\nt is a high priority, with the need for a better understanding of how abrupt vegetation changes (tree mortality and forest fires) and gradual changes (secondary succession and land degradation) may affect changes in E\nt and its relation to aCO\n\n2\n. Better understanding of these processes would lead to insights into the partitioning between E\nt and E\ns from ecosystems to global scales, which currently remains highly uncertain.\nFinally, there is a clear need for improvements in the representation of all these processes in ESMs to reduce the uncertainties in the assessment of future trends in E\nt (e.g., including whole plant hydraulic regulation). A scientific priority should be to better understand ecohydrological processes, which are strongly connected with climate change and have notable societal, economic, and ecological implications. This improved understanding can guide the establishment of better adaptation practices to the large and complex implications of the virtually certain enhancement of aCO\n\n2\n in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the research projects CGL2017-82216-R, PCI2019-103631 and PID2019-108589RA-I00, financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and FEDER; CROSSDRO project financed by the AXIS (Assessment of Cross(X) - sectorial climate Impacts and pathways for Sustainable transformation), JPI-Climate co-funded call of the European Commission; NGM and LRL were supported by the Department of Energy\u2019s Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Tropics.

Where springs are spatially isolated, \u2018ecological islands\u2019 can form (Bogan et al., 2014), providing habitats for endemic species to develop and evolve to the unique spring conditions (Davis et al., 2017). In the case of arid and semi-arid regions, springs may provide the only permanent source of water for significant distances, allowing for the survival of rare plants and a broad range of animal species (Springer and Stevens, 2009). Many ecologically and culturally significant spring complexes have been altered over the last century, attributable mainly to human-induced changes to groundwater regimes (Davis et al., 2017).\nSprings occur under a variety of hydrogeological conditions, commonly due to geological features that create transmissive pathways or barriers to flow (Bryan, 1919; Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Rowland et al., 2008). These geological features include faults, which are planar fractures or discontinuities in rock where displacement has occurred (Caine et al., 1996; Bense et al., 2013). Faults may impede and\/or act as preferential pathways to groundwater flow (Forster and Evans, 1991; Caine et al., 1996; Bense et al., 2013). Bryan (1919) and Meinzer (1923) define five spring types based on their subsurface geology (contact springs, fissure\/fault springs, depression springs, tubular or fracture springs and volcanic springs), of which, contact springs and fissure\/fault springs often occur due to faults (see Fig. 1\n). Springer and Stevens (2009) developed a revised inventory of 12 spring conceptual models, of which five include geological faults. Curewitz and Karson (1997) reviewed the structural settings of hot springs and found that 78% of the 822 hot springs inventoried were associated with faults. Although the review was specific to hot springs, there is evidence from case studies that other spring types (e.g., cooler 16\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C springs, acid sulphate springs, bubbling CO2 springs) are commonly associated with faults (e.g., Bignall and Browne, 1994; Battani et al., 2010; Apollaro et al., 2012).\nThe properties of faults and the associated hydrogeological processes have been extensively reviewed (e.g., Forster and Evans, 1991; Caine et al., 1996; Bense et al., 2013; Scibek et al., 2016), as has the hydrology of springs (e.g., Meinzer, 1923; Hynes, 1970; van der Kamp, 1995; Springer and Stevens, 2009; Kresic, 2010). While faults and springs have been reviewed independently, their hydrogeological interrelation has received little attention, and the current understanding of fault-controlled spring systems is based primarily on a review of the structural settings of hot springs by Curewitz and Karson (1997) and case studies (e.g., Jewell et al., 1994; Crossey et al., 2006; Rowland et al., 2008).\nThis review draws on existing literature on faults and springs to establish the current state of knowledge on fault-controlled spring systems. Although the review is based primarily on case studies of fault-controlled spring systems, some of the approaches discussed can be generalised to studies of faults or springs (e.g., the methods described to quantify spring discharge in Section 3.1 are similar for fault-controlled springs and other spring types). The following aspects of fault-controlled spring systems are reviewed: (1) hydrogeological processes; (2) field investigation techniques; (3) numerical modelling; and (4) management. Finally, we outline major knowledge gaps and future research directions required to improve the protection and reliable characterisation of fault-controlled spring systems, particularly those threatened by groundwater-affecting activities.\n\n\n2\nHydrogeological processes\nHere, the hydrogeological processes associated with the occurrence of springs that source water from groundwater flow through faults are subdivided into: (1) fault characteristics, (2) spring and aquifer hydraulics, and (3) surface conditions and spring environments.\n\n2.1\nFault characteristics\nFaults are classified based on their angle relative to the horizontal (i.e., dip) and the relative displacement of rock on either side of the fault plane (i.e., slip) (Bense et al., 2013). There are three main classes of faults (Fig. 2\n). Normal faults (Fig. 2a) occur due to extensional stresses, generally leading to dips of 45\u201370\u00b0 relative to the horizontal, although in some cases (e.g., when associated with metamorphic core complexes), normal faults can have dips at lower angles (e.g., Faulds and Varga, 1998; Faulds et al., 2008). Reverse (or thrust) faults (Fig. 2b) occur due to compressional stresses, causing dips generally <<45\u00b0 (Bense et al., 2013). Both normal (Fig. 2a) and reverse faults (Fig. 2b) have near-vertical slips (displacement of rock on one side of the fault relative to the other). Strike-slip faults (Fig. 2c and d) have vertical (or near-vertical) dips, with horizontal slips (Bense et al., 2013). They are classified as either left-lateral or right-lateral, based on whether the displacement is to the left (Fig. 2c) or the right (Fig. 2d) when viewed from either side. Additionally, faults can be a combination of the aforementioned four classes. For example, normal oblique-slip faults, which have been associated with hot springs (e.g., La Rosa et al., 2019), have components of both normal and strike-slip faults. The type of fault and its stress regime influence the fault permeability (e.g., extensional stresses can increase permeability). However, the fault permeability is also strongly influenced by the rock type and the fault architecture (Caine et al., 1996). This prevents the use of generic permeability models based only on the fault classification (Bense and Van Balen, 2004).\nConceptually, the fault architecture is represented using a three-component model comprising the fault core, the damage zone and the protolith (Caine et al., 1996; Mitchell and Faulkner, 2009) (Fig. 2a). The fault core is where most of the displacement has occurred, comprising deformed materials such as gouge, cataclasite, breccia and\/or smear (Caine et al., 1996; Torabi et al., 2019). The damage zone surrounds the fault core and features secondary structures such as micro- or macro-fractures arising from slip and\/or deformation events (Caine et al., 1996). The protolith is the surrounding material that has not been substantially modified by faulting (Bense et al., 2013).\nWhether the fault acts as a barrier and\/or a conduit to flow depends on its composition and the stage of fault evolution (Caine et al., 1996). For example, the core may act as a conduit immediately following deformation and later as a barrier due to the precipitation of minerals (Caine et al., 1996). Fluid flow in the damage zone is typically higher than in the fault core or protolith, occurring predominantly through fractures (e.g., Bense and Person, 2006; Folch and Mas-Pla, 2008). For example, the dataset of fault permeabilities compiled by Scibek (2020) indicate that the permeability of the damage zone is on average two orders of magnitude greater than the fault core.\nThe hydrogeologic behaviour of faults has been characterised in terms of the fault architecture by Caine et al. (1996), who suggested three quantitative indices:\n\n(1)\n\n\nF\na\n\n=\n\nW\ndz\n\n\/\n\n\n\nW\ndz\n\n+\n\nW\ncore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nF\nm\n\n=\nmean\n\n\nF\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nF\ns\n\n=\nmax\n\n\nF\na\n\n\n\u2212\nmin\n\n\nF\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere F\na represents the relative proportion of the damage zone present in the fault, with values that vary from zero to one, W\ndz is the damage zone width (m), and W\ncore is the core width (m). F\nm is the mean of spatial variations in F\na for a given fault, and F\ns is the range in F\na values for a given fault. As the damage zone is typically considered of higher permeability relative to the fault core, F\na values close to one indicate that the fault is likely to behave as a conduit to flow, whereas F\na values close to zero indicate that the fault is likely to act as a barrier (Caine et al., 1996). F\na can be calculated parallel and\/or perpendicular to the fault, wherever measurements are available, to assess the relative proportions of the spatial extent of the damage zone. As W\ndz and W\ncore can vary spatially, F\nm and F\ns can be useful for classifying the larger-scale behaviour of the fault (Caine et al., 1996).\nUnderstanding the relationship between fault and spring locations is a key area of research for fault-controlled springs. Curewitz and Karson (1997) conducted an extensive review of the geological settings of hot springs. They found that hot springs generally occurred in five structural settings along fault zones, including: (1) the fault tip where the breakdown area formed from intense fracturing gives rise to springs, (2) fault interaction areas where the breakdown areas from several fault tips interact or merge into a single breakdown area, (3) locked-in fault intersection areas where faults have opposing directions of slip leading to a breakdown area in the intersection between the faults, (4) slipping fault intersection areas where faults are slipping in the same direction, and there is limited breakdown area and (5) fault traces (i.e., surface disturbance where a fault intersects the ground surface) where localised fracturing may occur due to pressures during slip. Offsets between major faults, known as accommodation zones, are a form of interaction area that has been associated with high levels of geothermal activity and the occurrence of hot springs (e.g., Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Faulds et al., 2002). These studies suggest that fault-controlled springs, particularly fault-controlled hot springs, mostly occur where multiple fault traces interact (Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Faulds et al., 2002; Faulds et al., 2008).\n\n\n2.2\nSpring and aquifer hydraulics\nAn essential condition for the occurrence of springs is that the hydraulic head within the source aquifer (i.e., the aquifer providing water to the springs) must be sufficient for water to discharge to the surface. In confined aquifers, no major flow is expected through the confining unit unless preferential pathways (e.g., faults or fractures) are present (Brehme et al., 2016). The flow rate of a spring is directly related to the hydraulic head gradient between the aquifer and the surface (Woith et al., 2011; Brehme et al., 2016). As a lower bound, the hydraulic head in the source aquifer\/s must be greater than the topographic elevation at the point of spring discharge, referred to as the spring geomorphic threshold (Currell et al., 2017; Keegan-Treloar et al., 2021). The spring geomorphic threshold is the topographical elevation of the lip, mound or surface of the spring vent that the hydraulic head must exceed for the spring to discharge. If the hydraulic head in the source aquifer drops beneath the spring geomorphic threshold, the spring will cease to flow (e.g., Currell et al., 2017).\nAlthough the conceptual model of the spring geomorphic threshold and spring discharge is simple, spring discharge rates may be temporally variable, arising from complex external stresses. For example, Criss (2010) found that spring discharge rates may be influenced by events occurring over multiple timescales. They concluded that the flow from Big Spring (Missouri, USA) represented the superposition of long-timescale regional hydraulic head gradients and short-timescale pulse-type events due to aquifer head changes following local precipitation.\nConceptually, spring discharge rates are controlled by the source-aquifer hydraulic head and the fault conductance. Assuming Darcian flow in the fault, the conductance can be defined as:\n\n(4)\n\n\nC\nf\n\n=\n\nKA\n\n\u2206\nz\n\n\n=\n\nQ\n\n\u2206\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere, C\nf is the fault conductance [L2\u00a0T\u22121], K is hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone [L\u00a0T\u22121], A is the fault zone cross-sectional area to flow (i.e., fault width \u00d7 fault length) [L2], \u0394z is the difference in elevation between the spring geomorphic threshold and the source aquifer [L], Q is the spring discharge [L3\u00a0T\u22121], and \u0394h is the difference in elevation between the source aquifer head and the water level at the spring outlet [L]. However, as is the case in hydrogeology more generally, there are challenges in accurately quantifying K and \u0394h (e.g., Durner, 1994; Post and von Asmuth, 2013; Rau et al., 2019), which translate to uncertainties in estimates of C\nf.\nIn practice the fault conductance is a difficult parameter to measure, which can present problems in the translation of aquifer hydraulic head to spring discharge rates. For example, Love et al. (2013a) compared spring discharge rates to head differences between the source aquifer and the surface for mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin (Australia). They found no predictable relationships between the hydraulic head differences and the rate of spring discharge suggesting the fault conductance was highly variable between springs. As the fault conductance was unknown, they were unable to predict how spring discharge might vary in response to future changes in aquifer hydraulic head.\nThe fault conductance can undergo changes if the fault is seismically active (e.g., Gudmundsson, 2000), which can lead to temporal variations in discharge. Changes in fault conductance, aquifer permeability and other aquifer properties (e.g., storativity) have been observed following earthquake events, resulting in variations in the discharge and\/or water quality of the spring (e.g., Curewitz and Karson, 1997; Cox et al., 2012). For example, Cox et al. (2012) observed the emergence of new springs and a large change in groundwater levels following the magnitude 7.1 Darfield earthquake in Canterbury, New Zealand. These changes were hypothesised to be due to increased aquifer permeability, new fracture pathways, and changes in the aquifer properties (e.g., storativity and\/or transmissivity). Changes in spring water temperature and hydrochemistry were also observed following the Darfield earthquake, suggesting modified contributions from shallow meteoric and deeper groundwater to spring discharge (Cox et al., 2015). As such, the impact of seismic activity on fault behaviour and spring discharge may be an important consideration in characterising and managing fault-controlled springs in tectonically active regions.\n\n\n2.3\nSurface conditions and spring environments\nTravertine structures are a common surface expression of springs (e.g., De Filippis et al., 2012; Henchiri et al., 2017; Karaisao\u011flu and Orhan, 2018), typically occurring where spring discharge is high in CO2, leading to carbonate mineral precipitation due to differences between the partial pressures of CO2 in the ascending water and the atmosphere (Keppel et al., 2011). Travertine deposits may occur along fault traces, indicating fault locations (Hancock et al., 1999; Brogi and Capezzuoli, 2009). Travertine structures can lead to the modification of spring discharge rates by sealing flow pathways or forming impoundments around the spring vents. For example, Soda Dam is a large dam-like structure encompassing several springs in New Mexico (USA) that significantly alters discharge to the surrounding environment (Goff and Shevenell, 1987). In areas of travertine deposition, it is often necessary that faults are active to prevent the fault from sealing, which can lead to the cessation of spring discharge (Brogi and Capezzuoli, 2009). As such, the travertine deposits surrounding springs have been extensively used to provide a historic record of the fault and spring discharge activity (e.g., Hancock et al., 1999; Brogi and Capezzuoli, 2009; Priestley et al., 2018). For example, Brogi et al. (2012) used travertine deposits around thermal springs in the Sarteano area (Italy) to reconstruct the historical locations of the main discharge areas, the record of faulting events and the physicochemical properties of the discharge waters.\nSpring discharge to surface water bodies can support extensive ecosystems and niche habitats for endemic species (e.g., Wolaver and Diehl, 2011; Carvalho Dill et al., 2014). Spring-dependent ecosystems include terrestrial ecosystems surrounding the water source and aquatic ecosystems within the water source itself (Springer and Stevens, 2009). The variability, permanence and physiochemical characteristics (e.g., salinity, pH, temperature, nitrate) of spring discharge are key controls on the composition of dependent ecosystems (van der Kamp, 1995). However, detecting these relationships may be difficult, as Boy-Roura et al. (2013) found that some physiochemical characteristics of spring discharge (i.e., nitrate concentrations) remained constant annually while other characteristics (i.e., spring flow rates and electrical conductivity) were variable.\nSpring discharge that provides stream baseflow can support aquatic and terrestrial species during dry periods (Rossini et al., 2018; Bonada et al., 2007). These may include secondary ecosystems that rely on spring-fed streams and lakes (e.g., Bonada et al., 2007). For example, the Doongmabulla Springs Complex (Australia) provides baseflow to the nearby Carmichael River and supports a wide diversity of endemic species, which vary between individual spring vents (Fensham et al., 2016a; Currell et al., 2017). This variability indicates permanence of discharge and relative isolation of individual springs.\nDifferences have been observed in taxon number and composition between springs with permanent discharge or pooled water, and those with intermittent flow (Meyer and Meyer, 2000; Wood et al., 2005). Species often have lifecycles that have adapted to the specific spring discharge conditions. For example, springs with permanent discharge or pooled water have been shown to host unique species that require constant water availability. One such example are hydrobiids (a small snail species) found around springs in the Great Artesian Basin (Australia) that cannot undergo desiccation for more than a few minutes and require neutral to basic water in their habitat (Ponder and Colgan, 2002). Conversely, intermittent springs have been shown to host species capable of tolerating dry periods (Meyer and Meyer, 2000; Wood et al., 2005). For example, in a study of springs in the English Peak District (United Kingdom), Wood et al. (2005) found species adapted to dry periods through diapause, aestivation or extended flight periods. Meyer and Meyer (2000) propose that the unique adaptions of species present in springs may be used as a proxy to determine the flow conditions. This was demonstrated by Erman and Erman (1995), who found that caddisflies, calcium concentrations, moss, rooted plants, and temperature could be used as a proxy for spring discharge permanence.\nIn addition to the species in springs, the historical composition of wetland flora and fauna surrounding springs can provide information on how spring discharge conditions (e.g., flow rates and water chemistry) have changed over time (Smith et al., 2003). If spring conditions change, the composition of wetland flora and fauna may change to adapt to the new flow conditions (Ashley et al., 2004; Deane et al., 2017). For example, Ashley et al. (2004) used pollen and diatom records in soil cores to assess changes in the regional hydrology resultant from past climate change events.\n\n\n\n3\nField investigation techniques\nField investigation techniques are vital for gathering hydrogeological information to characterise and assist in the management of fault-controlled springs. Field investigation techniques include approaches to: (1) quantify spring discharge rates (e.g., weir-based methods), (2) identify source aquifers and their contribution to spring discharge (e.g., using isotopes and hydrochemistry from water samples), and (3) use geophysical techniques to investigate fault structure and properties (Fig. 3\n). Additionally, field campaigns routinely characterise spring ecosystem health and examine cultural and archaeological values of spring systems, although the related field techniques are not covered in the subsections that follow.\n\n3.1\nMethods for quantifying spring discharge\nQuantifying spring discharge, particularly its temporal variations, provides valuable information on both ecological requirements and changes to driving factors that control spring flow. For example, spring discharge rates have been used to estimate groundwater recharge (e.g., Segadelli et al., 2021), the baseflow contribution of springs to streams (e.g., Fournier et al., 1976; Fournier, 1989; Friedman and Norton, 2007), geothermal heat flux (e.g., Fournier et al., 1976; Mariner et al., 1990), and lag times between recharge and changes in spring discharge (e.g., Manga, 1999; Celico et al., 2006). Additionally, knowledge of spring discharge rates provide insight into aquifer characteristics (e.g., permeabilities, vertical fluxes), which are useful for constraining hydrogeological models (e.g., Manga, 1997; Saar and Manga, 2004; Mart\u00ednez-Santos et al., 2014). For example, Sato et al. (2000) found that spring discharge in Awaja Island (Japan) increased following an earthquake event (likely due to increased permeability), and gradually reduced following an approximately exponential trend. They used spring discharge observations to estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer material between the spring and its recharge area using equations derived from Darcy's law.\nSpring discharge rates have been quantified using a variety of techniques including direct flow measurements, Darcy's law-based approaches, physiochemical tracer methods and remote sensing techniques (see Table 1\n). The optimal method depends on the spring discharge rates being quantified, the physiochemical properties of water, the surrounding ecosystems, and the geomorphology of the spring vent. Details on the application of these techniques is provided below.\n\n3.1.1\nDirect measurements\nThe simplest form of direct flow measurements are timed volumetric measurements where the spring discharge is calculated from the time taken to fill a container of known volume (e.g., Gentry and Burbey, 2004; White et al., 2016; Segadelli et al., 2021). Despite the apparent simplicity of this technique, its application requires a localised discharge point, and can be problematic for springs with diffuse discharge. White et al. (2016) proposed that issues with diffuse discharge could be addressed by using flumes and sandbags to direct discharge to a measurement site. Although suitable for point in time measurements, caution is advised for the collection of long-term datasets as the modifications to the spring environment may degrade dependent ecosystems.\nWeir-type approaches lead to volumetric spring discharge estimates by using either a pressure transducer or a ruler to measure the height of water that passes through a weir with a known cross-sectional area (e.g., Felton and Currens, 1994; Zhang et al., 2013; Mathon et al., 2015). The application of weir-type approaches requires discrete or directed spring discharge, as might occur within a channel or waterway (e.g., Heasler et al., 2009), or through geomorphic features or within the spring tail in the case of mound springs. Weir-type approaches have been applied to spring discharge rates of up to 1200L\/s (e.g., Celico et al., 2006; Falcone et al., 2012).\nWhere spring discharges to a stream or creek, differential gauging can be applied to estimate spring discharge as the difference in streamflow upstream and downstream of the spring. This technique was used by Manga (1999) to obtain spring discharge rates in the range of 3200to 4800\u00a0L\/s. Although, this requires that discharge can be accurately measured using a weir, which is not always possible (e.g., during high or low flows, or in areas of hyporheic exchange).\n\n\n3.1.2\nDarcy's law-based approaches\nApproaches to calculate spring discharge based on Darcy's law use measured hydraulic gradients, flow cross-sectional areas, and hydraulic conductivity. Mart\u00ednez-Santos et al. (2014) installed piezometers in springs to measure vertical head gradients, which were subsequently used, along with permeabilities obtained from slug tests, to estimate spring discharge based on Darcy's law. This was applied to the Fuentes Grandes springs (Spain), leading to an estimate of spring discharge of ~0.5\u00a0L\/s. Despite the relatively simple nature of Darcy's law-based methods, these approaches are rarely applied in the literature, likely due to the high uncertainty in measurements of hydraulic conductivity.\n\n\n3.1.3\nChemical tracers\nThe most widely applied chemical tracer technique for the quantification of spring discharge to a stream is the chloride inventory technique (e.g., Ellis and Wilson, 1955; Fournier, 1989; Friedman and Norton, 2007). Discharge rates are quantified by sampling chloride concentrations in spring discharge and in a stream in the reaches above and below where the spring contributes to streamflow (Ellis and Wilson, 1955; Fournier et al., 1976). If differences in chloride concentrations are not detectable, a salt-dilution test can be used (e.g., White et al., 2016), where a known concentration of salt is released, and the concentration is monitored downstream. The chloride inventory method is not well suited to continuous automated monitoring as typically chloride concentrations cannot be easily measured in the field, although electrical conductivity has been used as a proportional surrogate for chloride (Norton and Friedman, 1985) allowing for the analysis of temporal changes. The chloride inventory method has been demonstrated for spring discharge rates between 0.39 and 3644\u00a0L\/s (Ingebritsen et al., 2001).\n\n\n3.1.4\nRemote sensing\nRemote sensing provides an attractive approach to quantify spring discharge, particularly for isolated data-sparse areas, as it relies on aerial- or satellite-derived products. Two main strategies have been applied, namely estimated wetland area (e.g., Williams and Holmes, 1978; White and Lewis, 2011; White et al., 2016), and aerial thermal imagery (e.g., Haselwimmer et al., 2013).\nWetland area approaches use a log-linear model to relate the spring wetland area to the spring discharge rate. Typically, a site-specific relationship is developed by measuring spring discharge rates (e.g., with a direct measurement technique) and using a log-linear regression model to develop a relationship between the wetland area and the observed spring discharge rates (e.g., Fatchen, 2001; White and Lewis, 2011). This relationship can then be used to monitor how the spring discharge rates change over time based on remotely sensed variations in the wetland area (e.g., Fatchen, 2001; White and Lewis, 2011). Generic relationships based on previous studies may be useful to provide approximate estimates of spring discharge rates. However, site-specific ecohydrological conditions will lead to different relationships between sites. Furthermore, Fatchen (2001) warned that extrapolating these relationships beyond the range of observed measurements (i.e., to extreme high or low discharge rates) can be problematic as the relationship may be valid for only a specific range of discharge rates. Wetland area-based approaches have been used to quantify spring discharge rates ranging from ~0.01\u00a0L\/s (Fatchen, 2001) to ~200\u00a0L\/s (Williams and Holmes, 1978).\nAerial thermal imagery can provide an alternative to wetland area-based remote sensing approaches, particularly for thermal springs. Haselwimmer et al. (2013) used remotely sensed thermal imagery (1\u00a0m pixels) to estimate spring discharge from the Pilgrim Hot Springs (Alaska). Their discharge estimates were obtained by first calculating a total heat flux from the springs and converting heat flux to a volumetric flux based on an assumed geothermal temperature for spring discharge and the thermal properties of water. This approach yielded estimates of spring discharge ranging between 1.1\u00a0L\/s and 17\u00a0L\/s, which was in reasonable agreement with field measurements of spring discharge. However, Haselwimmer et al. (2013) noted that discharge calculations were particularly sensitive to wind speeds.\n\n\n\n3.2\nTechniques to identify water origins\n\n3.2.1\nHydrochemistry\nBivariate plots, ternary diagrams, and specialised plots are often used to classify water types as a first step in the hydrochemical analysis of spring systems. Widely applied approaches include bivariate plots (e.g., Grobe and Machel, 2002), Schoeller diagrams (e.g., Bajjali et al., 1997), Piper plots (e.g., Brugger et al., 2005; Crossey et al., 2009; Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016), ternary diagrams (e.g., Duchi et al., 1995; Apollaro et al., 2012) and Langelier-Ludwig diagrams (e.g., Brombach et al., 2000; Frondini et al., 2009). Piper plots are a graphical procedure for visualising water chemistry and have been applied in studies of spring systems to identify contributing groundwater endmembers to spring discharge (e.g., Brugger et al., 2005; Crossey et al., 2009; Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016). Duchi et al. (1995) used a ternary diagram with analytes of HCO3, SO4 and Cl to classify water samples as groundwater (high HCO3), mature water (high Cl) or steam heated acidic waters (high SO4). They found that the spring waters plotted towards the HCO3 apex of the diagram, suggesting groundwater from a carbonate-source aquifer. Langelier-Ludwig diagrams (rectangular diagrams based on the percent of cations from Na\u00a0+\u00a0K and Mg\u00a0+\u00a0Ca, and the percent of anions from HCO3\u00a0+\u00a0CO3 and SO4\u00a0+\u00a0Cl) have been used in spring source-water studies to identify endmember water-types, geochemical reactions, and mixing (e.g., Frondini et al., 2009; Brogi et al., 2012). For example, Frondini et al. (2009) used a Langelier-Ludwig diagram to analyse hydrochemistry from springs and geothermal carbonate and metamorphic formations, finding four distinct water groups reflecting the geology and geochemistry of the source aquifers. These groups were tightly clustered, suggesting the sources were hydraulically isolated, and there was minimal mixing between sources.\nThe minerals present in spring discharge have been extensively used to characterise the subsurface geology and potential source aquifers (e.g., Brombach et al., 2000; Brugger et al., 2005; Frondini et al., 2009). Mineral speciation and saturation indices can be calculated using geochemical modelling software (e.g., PHREEQC, SOLMINEQ-88, Geochemists Workbench) and as they are dependent on temperature, these geochemical processes and water-rock interactions have been used to estimate the temperature in the source aquifer (e.g., Gemici and Tarcan, 2002) using a variety of techniques referred to as geothermometry (see Section 3.3).\n\n\n3.2.2\nIsotopes and age tracers\nThe stable isotopes of water (18O, 17O, 16O and 2H, 1H), have been used to trace the origin of spring water and provide information on the climatic and environmental conditions at the time of recharge (Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016). Comparing the stable isotopes of water with the local meteoric water line can provide insights into how evaporation and transpiration have influenced water composition and the seasonality of recharge (Appello and Postma, 2010). Stable isotopes of water have been used extensively to investigate the recharge elevation (e.g., Amoruso et al., 2011), the seasonality or age of spring source waters (e.g., Ingebritsen et al., 1992; Grobe and Machel, 2002; Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016) and evaporation and\/or transpiration (e.g., Duchi et al., 1995; Brusca et al., 2001; Brugger et al., 2005; Della Porta, 2015).\nAge tracer techniques utilise the known rates of radioactive decay of isotopes to determine groundwater age. By comparing the activity in a water sample with the initial activity (e.g., that in the atmosphere) it is possible to infer the age of the water (Kazemi et al., 2006; Bethke and Johnson, 2008). By examining age of spring discharge, it is possible to assess the vulnerability to impacts such as contamination and\/or groundwater drawdown (Kazemi et al., 2006; Bethke and Johnson, 2008).\nTritium (3H), a tracer that can be used to distinguish the presence of modern waters aged <50\u00a0years old, has been used in studies of fault-controlled springs (e.g., Heinicke and Koch, 2000; Demlie et al., 2008; Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016) to distinguish old deep-derived water from shallow younger waters. Radon-222 (222Rn), is another short-lived (half-life of 3.82\u00a0days) radioactive tracer that has been used to indicate the rapid ascent of water from a deep reservoir in spring discharge (e.g., Brugger et al., 2005) and to identify the contribution of 222Rn to water during flow through fractures or faults (Choubey et al., 2000). Changes in 222Rn concentrations have also been observed due to stress regimes before earthquake events, which has been used to provide information on the stress regimes and activity of faults beneath springs (Kuo et al., 2006).\nOther useful tracer techniques are based on isotopes of the carbon atom and their relative ratios in a water sample. The analysis of \u03b413C can be applied to CO2 gases (e.g., Cartwright et al., 2002; Battani et al., 2010), CH4 gases and carbonate minerals such as travertine (e.g., Brogi et al., 2012; De Filippis and Billi, 2012; Al\u00e7i\u00e7ek et al., 2016). Battani et al. (2010) used the \u03b413C of bubbling CO2 in spring discharge to assess the source of water to the springs and they found \u03b413C was similar to typical values for the mantle indicating a reasonable contribution (likely ~40%) from a deeper source. Often the \u03b413C values can vary within an aquifer unit, which makes it difficult to select a representative value for the aquifer. \u03b413C signatures from biological sources have been found in spring discharge to assist in the determination of the source of spring water. For example, Brugger et al. (2005) found \u03b413C in dissolved inorganic carbon ranged from \u221212.3 to \u22128.7\u2030 indicating a biological source, likely C-4 plants.\nThe \u03b413C of CO2 of travertine deposits surrounding springs has also been used to investigate the source of water contributing to spring discharge. For example, Brogi et al. (2012) studied \u03b413C values in travertine surrounding springs and found values of between 1.6 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.5\u2030, indicating a mix between hydrothermal fluids (\u03b413C\u00a0\u2265\u00a00) and shallow waters (\u03b413C\u00a0<\u00a0\u22124). The benefit of examining travertine deposits rather than water from the springs or aquifer directly, is that samples can be collected without the need to install invasive infrastructure (e.g., wells), and the deposits can potentially provide a historical record of \u03b413C. Similarly, radiocarbon (14C) has been used to calculate the age of old travertine deposits using an initial activity based on the ratio of the 14C activity in recent travertine deposits and atmospheric CO2 (Mas-Pla et al., 1992).\nNoble gases are produced in the crust (e.g., 4He, 40Ar), the mantle (e.g., 3He) or the atmosphere (e.g., 20Ne, 36Ar) and have been used in studies of springs to assess the contributions to spring discharge from recent recharge and old deeper groundwater (Gilfillan et al., 2011). The 3He\/4He ratio has been used widely in fault-controlled spring studies to assess the contributions of gases from the mantle and\/or crust to spring source waters (e.g., Hoke et al., 2000; Haszeldine et al., 2005; Crossey et al., 2006; Crossey et al., 2009). In contrast to 3He and 4He, 20Ne is primarily produced in the atmosphere and can be used to assess the atmospheric contribution to a sample (Gilfillan et al., 2011). For example, Chen et al. (2006) examined 4He\/20Ne in spring water samples to assess the relative contribution of fluids containing crustal gases (4He) and atmospheric gases (20Ne). They observed high ratios in spring water relative to the atmosphere, indicating the addition of 4He from a deep source, suggesting water may ascend via a fault.\n\n40Ar\/36Ar ratios have been measured in springs emanating from faults (e.g., Br\u00e4uer et al., 2011; Gilfillan et al., 2011), to assess the contribution to spring water from gases from the mantle (40Ar\/36Ar ratio\u00a0=\u00a0~40,000; Marty and Dauphas (2003)) and the atmosphere (40Ar\/36Ar ratio\u00a0=\u00a0295.5; Marty (1995)). For example, Gilfillan et al. (2011) observed 40Ar\/36Ar ratios from spring samples ranging from 1369 to 1687, indicating a contribution of 40Ar from the mantle. Crossey et al. (2006, 2009) compared 40Ar\/36Ar from spring samples with the concentrations of other noble gases (e.g., 3He) as different noble gases have distinct sources (i.e., the mantle, the crust, the atmosphere, etc.).\n\n\n3.2.3\nTemperature and geothermometers\nThe rate of groundwater ascent and contribution from deep aquifers to spring discharge can be estimated from spring water temperatures (Apollaro et al., 2012; Held et al., 2018). Typically, the temperature of groundwater increases with depth at a rate of 1\u00a0\u00b0C per 20\u201340\u00a0m (Anderson, 2005). In cases where springs source water from deep geological units, the spring discharge temperature may be elevated relative to ambient temperatures (Kresic, 2010; Wolaver et al., 2020). The temperature of spring source-water is related to a variety of factors including the source depth, the rate of ascent, the thermal conductivity of the geological media and the ambient surface temperatures (Blackwell, 1978; Brugger et al., 2005). The temperatures of spring discharge and aquifers can be measured directly using temperature sensors (e.g., Fairley and Hinds, 2004) or estimated based on chemical or isotopic indicators, called \u2018geothermometers\u2019 (e.g., Sakai and Matsubaya, 1974; Fournier, 1981; Giggenbach, 1988; Kharaka and Mariner, 1989; Arnorrson, 2000).\nGeothermometers reflect geochemical reactions that occurred under equilibrium conditions and the rate of these reactions can be slow relative to the rate of groundwater flow (Fournier, 1981; Giggenbach, 1988). The use of geothermometers may better capture the temperature in the spring source aquifer than direct temperature measurements, as discharging waters can quickly equilibrate to ambient groundwater or surface temperatures, especially where the rate of ascent is slow. Once spring discharge samples have been collected, chemicals or isotopes can be considered to assess the temperature in the source aquifer (Fournier, 1981; Giggenbach, 1988). Geothermometry has been extensively applied to studies of fault-controlled springs to estimate the temperature in the source aquifer (e.g., Ingebritsen et al., 1992; Duchi et al., 1995; Bajjali et al., 1997; Brombach et al., 2000; Goff et al., 2000; Gemici and Tarcan, 2002; Brugger et al., 2005; Apollaro et al., 2012). Each geothermometer has a specific temperature range over which it is valid. The width of these temperature ranges vary between geothermometers, which means geothermometers with a large range can be used to approximately estimate the temperature, which subsequently can be refined using geothermometers with a narrower temperature range. For example, in a study of the Paralana hot springs (South Australia), Brugger et al. (2005) used the saturation indices of quartz and chalcedony to estimate temperatures and refined these estimates using the saturation indices of other minerals with narrower temperature ranges (e.g., illite, montmorillonite, K-feldspar, muscovite). Table 2\n shows studies of fault-controlled spring systems where geothermometers were applied and the temperature range over which they are suitable.\n\n\n\n3.3\nGeophysical investigation techniques to determine fault structure and properties\nGeophysical techniques are a non-intrusive approach that have been used to assess subsurface hydrogeological processes (Revil et al., 2012; Inverarity et al., 2016; Banks et al., 2019). Both faults and springs have unique physical properties that are discernible using geophysical techniques. For example, the fault core may have a vastly greater density than the surrounding protolith, resulting in gravity anomalies in the vicinity of faults (Hochstein and Nixon, 1979). While springs can feature resistive zones due to fluid and gases in permeable conduits (Inverarity et al., 2016).\nA common first phase in hydrogeological investigations is to identify the locations of faults in large, poorly understood regions. Seismic surveys can assist by locating faults in regions up-to several kilometres in extent (Brogi et al., 2012). Similarly, magnetic and gravitational anomalies can be used to identify the location of faults using field measurements, airborne surveys or remote sensing products (Hochstein and Nixon, 1979; Ingebritsen et al., 1992; Finn and Morgan, 2002). Another secondary source of information is the location of springs themselves, as the geographical location of springs may indicate the fault location, which can be particularly clear when springs are aligned along a fault trace (e.g., Brogi et al., 2012). Together, these techniques provide a useful approach to identify the locations of faults for further study, particularly in data-poor areas where little subsurface information is available.\nOnce fault locations are identified, studying the structure (i.e., the core and damage zone) and properties (e.g., permeability, saturation) of the fault is often of interest. Electrical resistivity tomography can be applied to characterise fracture networks in the damage zone of a fault (Byrdina et al., 2009; Carbonel et al., 2013). For example, Byrdina et al. (2009) used electrical resistivity tomography transects to image faults in the area surrounding the Syabru-Bensi springs (Nepal) and concluded that resistive zones observed beneath springs were the result of fractures acting as conduits for the flow of water and gas. Applying multiple geophysical techniques in combination can provide complementary information. For example, Inverarity et al. (2016) conducted a study using self-potential, magnetotellurics and time-domain electromagnetics to image four mound springs in the Great Artesian Basin. Transects across the spring sites revealed an increase in self potential beneath the spring vents (which was hypothesised to represent upwards groundwater flow through a fault), while magnetotellurics and time-domain electromagnetics were used to image the geological structure and faults existing beneath the springs. Thus, the results from the three geophysical methods applied by Inverarity et al. (2016) were combined to create a conceptual model of flow through faults to each of the springs.\n\n\n\n4\nNumerical modelling\n\n4.1\nFault model types and associated flow assumptions\nAlthough analytical solutions exist for evaluating groundwater flow and solute transport within faults (e.g., Robinson and Werner, 2017), hydrological modelling of field-scale fault-controlled spring systems has thus far required the implementation of numerical methods (e.g., Folch and Mas-Pla, 2008; Magri et al., 2010; Yager et al., 2013). The representation of faults within numerical models depends on the intended use of the model. Types of groundwater models that include fault-controlled spring systems can be subdivided into: (1) Regional-scale, groundwater management models (e.g., Brunetti et al., 2013; OGIA, 2019; OGIA, 2020), and (2) Local-scale, process-investigation models (e.g., L\u00f3pez and Smith, 1995; Abbo et al., 2003; Sebben and Werner, 2016a). Both scales of fault-analysis face limitations. For example, the simulation of the fine-scale processes known to control the flow through faults is difficult at the resolution of regional-scale models, particularly if solute transport is considered (Weatherill et al., 2008; Sebben and Werner, 2016b). On the other hand, groundwater management issues that require representation of the flow through faults, such as the impacts of pumping, mining and climate variability in faulted aquifers, typically require consideration of large scales, and therefore, process-investigation models may have limited capacity to inform management decision making.\nThe main features of faults, described in Section 2.1, are represented to varying degrees in previous modelling studies, often due to limits imposed by model discretisation and associated model run times. Typically, there are three different approaches to the representation of faults in mathematical models, consistent with the categorisation suggested by Medici et al. (2021) for fracture flow in carbonate-rock aquifers, as: (1) cases where the fault core and damage zone may be integrated into a single unit or treated separately, but both are represented as equivalent porous media using macro-scale hydraulic properties (e.g., Bense and Person, 2006; Magri et al., 2010); (2) the fault core and damage zone are integrated into a single unit, and treated as a discrete conduit, whereby flow within the fault can be considered as Darcian (e.g., Poulet et al., 2021) or non-Darcian (e.g., Liu et al., 2017). The latter applies when fluxes are sufficiently high to violate the linearity assumptions of Darcian flow; (3) the fault core and damage zone are integrated into a single unit and represented as a network of discrete fractures (e.g., Huang et al., 2019). Caine et al. (1996) refers to categories (2) and (3) as \u2018localised conduit\u2019 and \u2018distributed conduit\u2019 representations, respectively.\nThe flow of groundwater through faults is often presumed to occur in a similar manner to flow through fractures (e.g., Caine and Forster, 1999), which is far more widely studied than flow through faults. Fracture flow may be Darcian or non-Darcian, depending on whether discharge is linearly or non-linearly related (respectively) to the head gradient (e.g., Reimann et al., 2011). Typically, the transition between Darcian and non-Darcian flow (which is typically associated with laminar and turbulent conditions) in fractures is predicted from the Reynolds number (R\n\ne\n), as given by Li et al. (2022) for a single fracture:\n\n(5)\n\n\nR\ne\n\n=\n\n\n2\nbq\n\n\n2\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere 2b is the characteristic length for rock fractures, typically assumed to be the fracture aperture [L], q is the specific discharge [L\u00a0T\u22121], and \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity [L2\u00a0T\u22121]. According to Quinn et al. (2020), there is disagreement about the critical Reynolds number representing the change of flow regime within fractures, although they reported that this is generally found to be <20. Li et al. (2022) suggest an R\n\ne\n value of about 0.9 as the upper limit for Darcian flow in fractures. They found that open fractures of aperture greater than 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0m involved non-Darcian flow, whereas the flow within smaller fractures could be treated as Darcian.\nWhere faults are treated as a fracture or network of fractures, the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fracture (K\nf [L\u00a0T\u22121]) is commonly adopted in models. K\nf is related to the fracture aperture via the cubic law, as (Witherspoon et al., 1980):\n\n(6)\n\n\nK\nf\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nb\n\n\n2\n\n\u03c1g\n\n\n12\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1 is fluid density [M\u00a0L\u22123], g is acceleration of gravity [L\u00a0T\u22122], and \u03bc is the dynamic fluid viscosity [M\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0T\u22121]. Sebben and Werner (2016a, 2016b) used this approach in their analyses of solute transport in single fractures within otherwise permeable aquifers.\n\n4.1.1\nEquivalent porous media\nThe most common approach for regional- and local-scale numerical investigations (i.e., scales larger than a few 10s of metres) commonly adopt the representation of faults described above as Category (1), i.e., the equivalent porous media approach for the fault core and damage zone (e.g., Bense and Person, 2006; Magri et al., 2010). In representing the fault core and damage zone as equivalent porous media, small-scale flow processes expected in the fractures of the damage zone are neglected.\nThe porous media properties assigned to the core and damage zones, when these zones are explicitly represented in numerical models, vary over several orders of magnitude across modelling case studies. For example, Taillefer et al. (2017) used an equivalent porous media for the damage zone, with permeability four orders of magnitude greater than the core zone. Magri et al. (2010, 2012) also adopted a large permeability ratio between the two zones in their finite-element models, although the numerical value of the ratio is not given (i.e., the isotropic hydraulic conductivity of the core zone is reported as ~0\u00a0m\/year, with an isotropic value of 32\u00a0m\/year attributed to the damage zone). These core-damage zone contrasts in permeability exceed the average permeability ratio between the two zones obtained by Scibek (2020) and Forster and Evans (1991) (i.e., two orders of magnitude difference; Section 2.1).\nWhen adopting the equivalent porous media approach and treating the core and damage zone as a single unit, faults may be assigned an anisotropic hydraulic conductivity, where the hydraulic conductivity parallel to the fault plane is greater than the one perpendicular to it (e.g., L\u00f3pez and Smith, 1996; Bense et al., 2003; Bense et al., 2008). Other cases adopt isotropic hydraulic properties and neglect the enhanced permeability parallel to the fault or the reduced permeability perpendicular to the fault. For example, Marshall et al. (2020) neglected the damage zone and represented the fault as a barrier to flow, with low permeability (relative to the protolith) assigned to the fault. L\u00f3pez and Smith (1995) and Folch and Mas-Pla (2008) adopted higher permeability (relative to the protolith) for the fault to represent its tendency to transmit flow along the fault axis. Scanlon et al. (2003) used the Horizontal-Flow Barrier (HFB) package of MODFLOW (Hsieh and Freckleton, 1993) to represent faults implicitly as isotropic, low-permeability features (the HFB package cannot simulate anisotropic features) in simulations of the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer (USA).\n\nMcCallum et al. (2018) included the modified conductance approach or \u201cManzocchi method\u201d (e.g., Manzocchi et al., 1999) as a variation to the equivalent porous media approach. In the Manzocchi method, fault properties are represented by adopting \u201ctransmissivity multipliers\u201d, which are functions that modify the flow terms at the model cells where faults are located, rather than explicit representation of faults and their conductance properties. While the Manzocchi method is not commonly applied in groundwater flow studies, it is widely applied in the petroleum industry, as discussed by Turnadge et al. (2018). Application examples of the Manzocchi method can be found in Manzocchi et al. (2010), Michie et al. (2018), Wilson et al. (2020), and Islam and Manzocchi (2021), among others.\n\nMcCallum et al. (2018) undertook a comparison between the Manzocchi method and the equivalent porous media. Their numerical modelling results demonstrated that in cases where a fault acts as a barrier to flow, either method to represent the fault can be adopted. However, in cases where the fault acted as a conduit to flow, there was poor agreement between the two methods of representing faults.\n\n\n4.1.2\nDiscrete conduits\n\nCaine and Forster (1999) suggested that strike-slip faults (Fig. 2c, d) may be treated as localised, discrete conduits, representing flow within the space between adjacent slipped walls of the fault. Grant (2020) advised that the fault core may be converted to a conduit for fluid movement if, prior to faulting, the protolith was over-consolidated, causing dilation and enhanced fracturing of the core. For example, Coates et al. (1994) suggested that Moosy Brook Spring (USA) is an example of a fault-controlled spring caused by a localised conduit-type fault, where spring discharge between 189 and 227\u00a0L\/min was observed.\nThe simulation of faults as discrete conduits requires the application of \u2018hybrid models\u2019 (Reimann et al., 2011), wherein one-dimensional features can be embedded into n-dimensional models (e.g., Shoemaker et al., 2008; Sebben and Werner, 2016a, 2016b; Poulet et al., 2021). When flow through discrete apertures is Darcian, the cubic law applies (Eq. (6)), whereas non-Darcian flow requires application of nonlinear, pipe flow equations, such as the Forchheimer and Darcy-Weisbach equations (e.g., Shoemaker et al., 2008; Qian et al., 2015). The choice of approach depends on R\n\ne\n (Eq. (5)). Both laminar and turbulent flow can be simulated using common groundwater flow codes, such as the Conduit Flow Process (CFP) of MODFLOW-2005 (Shoemaker et al., 2008) or the conduit flow model capability of FEFLOW (Diersch, 2014). Both codes allow conduits to be embedded into the porous matrix.\n\nFang and Zhu (2018) reported that the adoption of the cubic law and the assumption of Darcian flow to simulate large fractures leads to overestimates of groundwater flow rates. Similarly, Reimann et al. (2011) found that the assumption of laminar flow within conduits overestimated groundwater discharge via springs. More generally, Scanlon et al. (2003) concluded that the validity of a groundwater model to estimate flow rates is limited if laminar flow is assumed in a faulted system. However, groundwater numerical investigations rarely adopt non-Darcian flow to represent faults (e.g., Liu et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2019). Rather, non-Darcian flow is more frequently applied for the study of karst conduits (e.g., Saller et al., 2013; Reimann et al., 2011; Kavousi et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2021), which have considerably larger apertures than fractures.\n\n\n4.1.3\nDiscrete fracture networks\nThe representation of faults using fracture networks allows for the analysis of local-scale processes that arise within the complex geological structures of faults, including localised permeability distributions (e.g., Caine and Forster, 1999). However, there are few examples of these in the published literature (e.g., Herbert, 1996; Caine and Forster, 1999; Huang et al., 2019; Volatili et al., 2019). Numerical models adopting discrete fracture networks (not necessarily related to faults) often apply stochastic techniques (e.g., de Dreuzy et al., 2012; Li et al., 2020) to explore the uncertainty that arises from the lack of sufficient field data to characterise fracture networks (Herbert, 1996; Medici et al., 2021). The stochastic representation of discrete fracture networks represents the most complex approach to the simulation of faults (Turnadge et al., 2016) and requires the largest computational burden (McCallum et al., 2018). Attempts to capture the physical realism of fracture networks using simpler, more-efficient representations have been made by Romano et al. (2017, 2020), who provides examples of the conversion from discrete fracture networks to equivalent porous media, allowing for more efficient simulation of large-scale fractured systems.\n\n\n4.1.4\nNumerical modelling case studies of fault-controlled springs\nDespite the significant number of studies relying on numerical modelling to understand groundwater flow systems affected by faults (e.g., Bense et al., 2013), the numerical simulation of fault-controlled springs is scarce. Table 3\n lists the study objectives, model characteristics, and conceptualisations for nine modelling case studies found in the published literature.\n\nTable 3 shows that in the context of groundwater flow, the equivalent porous media approach is the most widely used to represent the influence of faults, whereas the adoption of a specified head is the most common approach to treat fault-controlled springs in models. MODFLOW and FEFLOW are the most commonly applied codes adopted in studying fault-controlled spring systems. Only one regional-scale study (that used FEFLOW), undertaken by Brunetti et al. (2013), was apparent in the literature, using the earlier definition of regional-scale (Section 4.1).\n\n\n\n\n5\nManagement\nDue to the high levels of ecological endemism, cultural significance and heritage values associated with many springs, their protection is a critical priority for environmental and natural resource management (Hatton and Evans, 1998; McMorran, 2008; Kresic, 2010; Brake et al., 2019). However, effective spring management, i.e., to achieve ecological and other objectives, presents multiple, substantial challenges. These include the high sensitivity of many spring environments and their ecosystems to disturbances, which requires a precautionary approach to avoid potentially irreversible damage (e.g., Kresic, 2010). The loss of many significant spring complexes worldwide over the past century (e.g., Fensham et al., 2016b; Silcock et al., 2020) highlights their vulnerability to human pressures.\nHuman pressures on springs can lead to serious environmental degradation and\/or the extinction of rare or endangered ecosystems (Ponder, 1986; Fensham et al., 2010) due to changes in the flow rate, wetland area or water chemistry. Management regimes aimed at protecting springs were generally broadly applicable to both fault-controlled springs and other spring types, rather than being specifically focused on fault-controlled springs. These regimes often involved the use of drawdown trigger levels, which define maximum allowable drawdown thresholds that can be used to instigate changes to activities that modify water levels in an aquifer (Currell, 2016; Doody et al., 2017). Such approaches may be attractive due to their apparent simplicity and ease of application (e.g., Werner et al., 2011). However, Currell (2016) pointed out several potential pitfalls, particularly if triggers are not complemented with additional monitoring and compliance criteria (e.g., a combination of water level, flow, and ecological-based indicators). Additionally, groundwater head and flow patterns in the vicinity of faults are often complicated and may change dramatically over relatively short distances (e.g., on either side of a fault and\/or between overlying aquifers in a faulted sequence; Bense and Van Balen, 2004). It may not be immediately obvious where the most appropriate locations and depths are to monitor groundwater levels that drive spring discharge, and\/or what the appropriate threshold levels are to achieve certain management objectives. Identifying the relationships between changes in aquifer hydraulic head and spring discharge rates can be difficult as spring discharge rates are dependent on the fault conductance (see Section 2.2), which is difficult to accurately measure. Nevertheless, establishing relationships between water level patterns, spring discharge and the associated habitat characteristics and functions supporting sensitive species have been shown to be important for effectively managing these systems (Eamus et al., 2006; Fensham et al., 2010). Detailed field investigations are especially important in fault-controlled spring systems as faulting and other geological heterogeneity can make the discharge pathways, and thus appropriate monitoring indicators difficult to establish (e.g., Wu et al., 2011).\n\nCurrell (2016) and Noorduijn et al. (2018) demonstrated that a reliance on trigger-level-based management systems may fail to consider reductions in spring discharge that are not necessarily apparent from monitoring drawdown. For example, observation wells that are situated at or near the spring location may not show drawdown from human activities until significant time-lags have passed, after which the impacts arising from groundwater extraction may be permanent (Alley et al., 2002). This was illustrated by Bredehoeft and Durbin (2009) who used a threshold for spring discharge as a trigger for stopping pumping. In their simulation, the management action was taken at a 10% reduction in spring discharge. However, even with management action, spring discharge continued to decline for ~25\u00a0years to a maximum reduction of discharge of ~18%, and it took a further ~100years for the spring discharge to recover to above the 10% flow reduction threshold.\nMany studies aimed at managing groundwater-dependent ecosystems have identified the importance of baseline and ongoing assessments that integrate knowledge from remote sensing, field-based monitoring, modelling and expert knowledge (Eamus et al., 2006; Humphreys, 2009; Doody et al., 2017). In addition to data obtained using traditional scientific measurement and sampling techniques, information about long-term hydrological and ecological functioning and variability of springs can be gained from historical records, indigenous knowledge, and archaeological evidence (Florek, 1993; Fensham et al., 2016a; Brake et al., 2019; Silcock et al., 2020).\n\n\n6\nFuture challenges and research opportunities\nDespite extensive bodies of research on faults and springs separately, there remains significant challenges and knowledge gaps to be addressed in each phase of hydrogeological investigations of fault-controlled spring systems. The key challenges and research opportunities are discussed below.\n\n6.1\nHydrogeological processes\nCharacterising the relationships between spring discharge rates and ecosystem functioning (including the associated vulnerability of these ecosystems to changes in spring discharge rates) is a critical area for future research. In addition to surface discharge, near-surface discharge (i.e., subterranean leakage to the near-surface) is an often-overlooked contribution of springs to ecosystems that can occur in the area surrounding a fault-controlled spring. Near-surface discharge can occur via lateral leakage from the subsurface structures (e.g., faults) beneath springs regardless of whether the spring actively discharges to the surface or not. For example, in a study of Francis Swamp (Australia), Lewis et al. (2013) observed low surface temperatures (relative to ambient conditions) in areas with and without active spring vents. This suggested subsurface seepage may be occurring in these areas. This type of near-surface discharge has been acknowledged as critical for certain groundwater-dependent ecosystems (see type 3 GDEs in Eamus et al. (2006)) and warrants further investigation as it may be as (if not more) sensitive to water level changes than surface discharge.\nThe hydrogeological processes relating to springs that emanate from faults remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to effectively manage these systems. In particular, future studies into the relationship between fault type (e.g., Fig. 2) and spring occurrence will provide much needed understanding on the functioning of fault-controlled spring systems. Future research would benefit from combined laboratory and in situ studies of fault permeability (e.g., packer tests or pumping tests; see Bense et al. (2013) for additional approaches) to provide insights into permeability ratios between measurements taken along the fault trace where springs occur and where springs are absent. Additionally, knowledge and datasets from other disciplines (e.g., structural geology, petroleum, mining) could be translated into the field of hydrogeology to improve the understanding of fault properties and behaviour.\nMeasurements of spring discharge provide a rare opportunity to directly observe groundwater fluxes, something that is otherwise extremely difficult in hydrogeology. Direct spring discharge measurements provide useful information that has been used to characterise groundwater flow conditions and constrain numerical models (e.g., Manga, 1997; Saar and Manga, 2004; Mart\u00ednez-Santos et al., 2014). Technology is not a limitation for monitoring spring discharge rates, as proven techniques can be applied to monitor spring discharge rates (see Section 3.1). In contrast to typical groundwater measurements, spring discharge rates can be measured without installing wells, substantially reducing the cost of measurements. Despite a variety of methods being available (direct measurements, Darcy's law, chemical tracers and remote sensing; see Section 3.1), spring discharge measurements are not a routine part of water resource monitoring regimes. The availability of daily or sub-daily spring discharge estimates could provide significant benefits to management. Ideally, spring discharge time series could be viewed in the same light as stream and well hydrographs, which are routinely monitored.\nAs discussed in section 2.2, tectonic activity often influences fault behaviour (e.g., by opening new fractures or clearing mineral precipitates), which can have dramatic impacts upon spring discharge rates and water properties. Despite the potential for earthquakes to impact fault-controlled spring systems, these impacts are rarely considered in practice. Thus, the management of fault-controlled spring systems would benefit from increased collaboration between water managers and seismologists.\n\n\n6.2\nField investigation techniques\nMuch can be learnt about fault-controlled spring systems from surface conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated the use of travertine structures (e.g., Brogi and Capezzuoli, 2009; Love et al., 2013b; Priestley et al., 2018), wetland area (e.g., Lewis et al., 2013) and fossilised pollen and diatoms (e.g., Ashley et al., 2004) to assess the spring discharge rates and historical variability. However, there is scope for this work to be expanded and for the consideration of additional surface features. For example, the hydrobiids discussed by Ponder and Colgan (2002) can be used as an indicator of spring discharge permanence, due to their limited tolerance to dry conditions. Additionally, indigenous knowledge, paintings and artefacts provide an underutilised source of information to construct a historic record of spring locations (Fensham et al., 2016b).\nCharacterising whether a fault acts as a conduit or barrier to flow requires detailed investigations into the geological properties of the fault. Relationships based on the relative proportions of core and damage zone (see Section 2.2) are a good starting point to determine whether a fault will act as a conduit or barrier to flow. However, detailed field studies will invariably be required to properly characterise the fault behaviour and properties. As springs often have high ecological and cultural values, invasive techniques (e.g., trenching or drill holes) may not be appropriate. This means future studies of fault-controlled spring systems should consider non-invasive techniques to investigate these systems. Geophysics can provide a non-invasive approach to characterise subsurface geology and to identify areas of vertical flow. For example, Inverarity et al. (2016) found self-potential can be helpful to identify the locations of vertical flow beneath springs, while magnetotellurics and time-domain electromagnetics can be used to identify faults and other high conductivity pathways. Hydraulic tomography using artificial stimuli (e.g., pumping tests) and natural stimuli (e.g., changes in river stage, lightning, earthquakes, barometric pressure changes) have been applied to characterise faults and fractures over both local and basin scales (e.g., Yeh and Lee, 2007; Yeh et al., 2008; Zha et al., 2016). The further use of geophysics and application of hydraulic tomography techniques to assess the subsurface characteristics of fault-controlled spring systems will provide a much-improved understanding of these systems.\nUnderstanding the relationship between source aquifers and spring discharge is important to assess the vulnerability of springs to external stresses (Boy-Roura et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2017). Identifying the source aquifer and monitoring the relevant hydraulic head can be difficult if monitoring infrastructure is deemed a risk to ecologically significant ecosystems (e.g., Inverarity et al., 2016) or where large hydraulic head differences exist across a fault zone (e.g., Bense and Van Balen, 2004). Detailed understanding of fault-controlled spring systems can be obtained through the collection spring discharge hydrographs, hydrochemical time-series and the creation of a database of spring discharge and aquifer hydrographs. For example, Boy-Roura et al. (2013) collected nitrate concentration time-series from spring discharge to monitor the nitrate mass recharge rates. Similarly, spring discharge hydrograph databases have been created for karst systems (e.g., Olarinoye et al. (2020)) and could be extended to include non-karst fault-controlled spring systems.\nStudies of karst systems have developed various tracer and hydrograph analysis techniques (e.g., Taylor and Greene, 2005; Goldscheider et al., 2008; Luhmann et al., 2012). Tracers have been used to identify flow directions, velocities and conduits between recharge and discharge areas, including springs (e.g., Taylor and Greene, 2005; Goldscheider et al., 2008; Luhmann et al., 2012). Examples of tracers given by Goldscheider et al. (2008) include dyes (e.g., uranine, eosin, pyranine), dissolved salts (e.g., sodium, potassium, bromide) and particles (e.g., fluorescent microspheres, bacteria, bacteriophages). Similarly, spring discharge hydrograph analysis is well developed for karst systems to provide information on aquifer properties and the response of spring discharge to external stresses (Taylor and Greene, 2005). For example, techniques are presented to estimate transmissivity from the recession of spring-discharge hydrographs (Taylor and Greene, 2005). Although not directly applied to fault-controlled springs, many of these techniques are relevant, and their translation would be a valuable future contribution.\nThe proportion of spring discharge contributed from potential source aquifers can be assessed through the comparison of spring water samples and wells cased in potential source aquifers. When water samples are available from potential source aquifers and springs, mixing models can be used to relate the concentrations of ions or isotopes to the proportion of water contributed to spring discharge from each aquifer. However, in data sparse areas where groundwater samples are not available, noble gases (e.g., 4He, 40Ar, 20Ne) can provide an approach to assess the contribution from different sources to spring discharge. The concentrations of these gases are known in the atmosphere, the mantle, and in the crust (Gilfillan et al., 2011). Thus, analyses of noble gasses can be used to determine whether spring discharge shows evidence of being sourced from shallow aquifers or recent recharge (i.e., if the concentration is similar to that in the atmosphere), or if the sample is more consistent with a deeper source (i.e., if the concentration is similar to that in the mantle or the crust). Other isotopes can provide complementary information, for example, the stable isotopes of water in spring discharge can be used to infer recharge elevation, recharge seasonality and the amount of evapotranspiration. \u03b413C in spring discharge can be used to assess the contribution of deep waters through a comparison with the concentrations in the mantle, the atmosphere, biological sources or the concentrations in potential source aquifers. Travertine structures can provide an alternate method of obtaining \u03b413C from spring discharge. As these structures often reflect precipitation of minerals from spring discharge that has occurred over a long timescale, these deposits may provide a historic record of \u03b413C. In particular, a greater focus on the development of strategies to characterise springs primarily using analytes that can be obtained without the use of invasive monitoring infrastructure will assist in the management of fault-spring systems.\nTemperature has been used to identify spring vents (e.g., Lewis et al., 2013), characterise aquifer permeability fields (e.g., Saar, 2011), estimate the depth of spring source-waters with geothermometry (e.g., Fournier, 1981; Kharaka and Mariner, 1989) and calculate spring discharge using a heat flux approach (e.g., Haselwimmer et al., 2013). Although not demonstrated in the reviewed case studies, newer geothermometry techniques are available (see Arnorrson (2000)), and the application of these techniques to fault-controlled springs would represent a valuable future contribution. Furthermore, the use of heat as a tracer to quantify spring discharge remains largely underutilised, a point that has been made about the use of heat as a tracer in hydrogeology more generally (Kurylyk and Irvine, 2019). Benefits of the use of heat as a tracer to quantify fluid flows include the availability of robust, low-cost sensors (Anderson, 2005; Irvine et al., 2017; Kurylyk et al., 2019) and the fact that temperature-based methods can be used to produce time series estimates of fluid flows (Irvine et al., 2020). Temperature-time series approaches can be used to estimate spring discharge using temperature sensor pairs (e.g., Hatch et al., 2006; Keery et al., 2007), or using other signal processing techniques that allow for multiple frequencies (aside from simple diurnal) and for two or more depths (e.g., Vandersteen et al., 2015). Several software packages are available to facilitate the application of these methods (e.g., Irvine et al., 2015; Vandersteen et al., 2015; Ford et al., 2021). Active heat tracer methods provide an alternative approach to quantify discharge whereby an artificial heat source is used to estimate groundwater flux (e.g., Lewandowski et al., 2011; Banks et al., 2018).\n\n\n6.3\nNumerical modelling\nGiven the widespread use of numerical models in groundwater management, significant benefits can come from improved numerical representation of fault-controlled springs. Although faults are typically composed of complex fracture networks, the extensive body of literature on modelling of fractured rock systems has not been translated into guidance on fault simulation. McCallum et al. (2018) identified that the type of numerical approach is important when faults act as conduits to flow. However, the comparison undertaken by McCallum et al. (2018) did not include the treatment of faults as fracture networks. A host of opportunities to further investigate the optimal numerical techniques to treat fault-derived springs remains. For example, the new unstructured grid version of MODFLOW (Panday et al., 2017) provides new capabilities to better represent faults in equivalent porous media models without significantly increasing the computational burden (McCallum et al., 2021). However, further investigations are required to determine appropriate modelling approaches to represent fault-controlled springs, including further investigation into the use of discrete conduits and discrete fracture networks.\nRegional-scale models impose a significant computational challenge, especially if fault-related flow process are simulated. The applicability of numerical permeameters for the upscaling of fault hydraulic properties (e.g., Lupton et al., 2019) should be further investigated to improve the computational performance of faulted groundwater systems. Formal uncertainty analysis of groundwater flow systems affected by faults is also lacking in the current published literature.\n\n\n6.4\nManagement of fault-controlled springs\nGiven their ecological and spiritual importance, the management of springs emanating from faults the management of these fault-controlled spring systems will benefit from the adoption of a structured management approach (e.g., adaptive management) with pre-defined mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies should consider whether the impacts are reversible and the time scales of impacts (Thomann et al., 2020). When impacts are irreversible or reversible only over significant periods of time (e.g., centuries), the need for monitoring protocols for early detection of impacts becomes increasingly important. Numerical modelling can be an important tool to inform managers of the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.\nManagement regimes should to identify: (1) the source aquifer(s) and major discharge pathway(s); (2) the spring geomorphic threshold(s) required to maintain discharge to the surface; (3) the relationship(s) between water level patterns in the source aquifer(s) and flow rates at the springs; (4) the ecological thresholds (e.g., spring discharge rates) required to sustain habitat for a particular species and\/or ecological communities; and (5) the stakeholder perspectives on the significance and value of the spring(s). A comprehensive understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of springs is essential for the effective and science-based management of these systems. Hence, studies that integrate spring ecosystem responses within hydrological models, to assess ecosystem changes due to development pressures, are a critical area for future research. This is especially important for projects that may irreversibly compromise the ecological and\/or cultural values of a system (Thomann et al., 2020).\nFurther to these recommendations, the use of comprehensive post audits of management plans could consider a range of factors including the choice and efficacy of mitigation measures, and the relationship between the use of prescribed management strategies and positive or negative management outcomes. Detailed post audits can help to retrospectively identify strategies that were effective (or ineffective) for the management of fault-controlled spring systems and encourage effective management by learning from past management experiences.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThis review of fault-controlled springs revealed fundamental shortcomings in the present understanding of these systems. Characteristics of fault-controlled spring systems that remain poorly understood include the translation of source-aquifer hydraulic head to spring discharge rates, the fault structure and hydraulic properties (and their representation in models), and the impact of fault activity on spring discharge rates. A critical barrier to the characterisation of many fault-controlled spring systems is the need to protect spring expression features (e.g., calcareous mound structures) and accompanying wetlands, which often have high cultural and ecological values, from invasive methods of investigation (e.g., drilling). Studies of fault-controlled springs have typically focussed on one specific component of the system (e.g., the spring, the fault, or groundwater-dependent ecosystems) rather than the broader system and the interdependencies between components. Thus, a greater emphasis is needed on the analysis of interactions between faults and springs. This will allow spring measurements to be used in evaluating fault properties, amongst other benefits of considering faults and springs as connected, interdependent systems. This will also help to identify the sensitivity of fault-controlled spring systems to natural and anthropogenic forcings; a critical requirement of spring and spring-dependent ecosystem management. Finally, we recommend the establishment of several well-characterized field examples within both natural and modified hydrogeological settings to help elucidate critical functions and to advance the current understanding of fault-controlled spring systems.\n\n","94":"","95":"","96":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nUpper crustal extension of layered sequences in sedimentary basins is usually accommodated by a combination of localised discontinuous deformation (faulting and fracturing) and continuous deformation (folding), with the latter often involving a combination of flexural-slip and flexural-flow folding. Whilst the prevalence of brittle deformation processes at shallow to moderate crustal depths is widely recognised, the importance of localised slip along bedding, i.e., bed-parallel slip (BPS), is not. In this study we investigate the nature of BPS within multilayer sequences in extensional tectonic regimes, developing upon previous studies on similar processes and structures, including layer-parallel slip, bedding-parallel fault, flexural-slip fault, layer-parallel shear or bed-parallel shear (e.g., Chapple and Spang, 1974; Salehy et al., 1977; Higgs et al., 1991; Gross et al., 1997; Ferrill et al., 1998; Li et al., 2015; Lemonnier et al., 2020).\nBPS has long been recognised and extensively investigated in compressional tectonic regimes. In fold and thrust belts, in particular, layer parallel shortening is accommodated by ramp-flat thrust systems (e.g., Rich, 1934; Sanderson, 1982; Eisenstadt and De Paor, 1987) and associated flexural-slip and flexural-flow folding (e.g., Ramsay, 1974; Tanner, 1989; Horne and Culshaw, 2001; Ishii, 2016). The importance of BPS is promoted by the moderate deformation depths of fold and thrust belts (< ca. 10\u00a0km), and by the low angle between mechanical layering and sub-horizontal shortening, a scenario which favours slip localisation along bedding.\nBy contrast, in regions subjected to extension, BPS is less often considered to be an intrinsic component of accommodating deformation. During the last decade, however, there has been an increasing number of studies describing BPS associated with normal faulting (e.g., Weinberger et al., 2016; Delogkos et al., 2017, 2018; Laubach et al., 2018; Alsop et al., 2020; Lemonnier et al., 2020; Nabavi et al., 2020), and supporting the importance and abundance of BPS in extensional tectonic settings. In this study, we provide an overview of the origin and nature of BPS associated with normal fault systems, outlining the geometrical and kinematic relationships between the BPS planes and normal faults, on the one hand, and the magnitude of slip and spatio-temporal distribution of BPS planes, on the other. This review concentrates on conventional rift systems with low-moderate basin extensions, and does not consider more highly extended crustal systems comprising the shallow-dipping rotated faults and regionally extensive detachments, including those developed in association with metamorphic core complexes and continental hyperextension (e.g., Carmignani and Kligfield, 1990; Peacock et al., 2000; Ye et al., 2022).\nSince the early work by Anderson (1905), it has been long known that normal, thrust and strike-slip faults can often be distinguished by the geometries, slip directions and orientations of associated, sometimes conjugate, faults. By contrast, BPS planes have a geometry that is intrinsically controlled by mechanical layering, with their formation arising from local stress conditions and bed-parallel localisation rather than simply reflecting the far-field tectonic setting under which they formed. Consequently, it can be challenging to identify the origin of BPS, in particular in regions that have had a polyphase tectonic history (e.g., S\u00e9journ\u00e9 et al., 2005; Lemonnier et al., 2020). In this study, we provide a basis for defining the origins of BPS and shedding light on the challenges of interpreting BPS.\nBy comparison to dip-slip normal faults offsetting shallow-dipping sedimentary layers, identification of BPS is often difficult due to the bed-parallel nature of BPS and the paucity of offset markers. In some instances, BPS planes can be diagnosed from associated microstructures such as slickenlines, shear veins, fault rock and\/or mineralisation, either from outcrop or well data (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2007; Weinberger et al., 2016; Lemonnier et al., 2020), but in many others these may not be identifiable and\/or present (e.g., Delogkos et al., 2017, 2018; Alsop et al., 2020; Nabavi et al., 2020). BPS planes may, therefore, remain invisible in the absence of other displaced markers such as faults, veins or joints that are oblique to bedding. For these reasons, recognition of BPS from seismic reflection data is not straightforward because the displaced markers and BPS planes are likely to be below the limit of seismic resolution. This review of the characteristics and various contexts of BPS is intended to provide constraints on the occurrence and development of BPS in extensional settings. We suggest that together with faults, veins, and joints, BPS planes are fundamental and prevalent discontinuities within deformed rock volumes. Not only are they a key component of how deformation is partitioned, they can also affect fluid flow (e.g., Couples et al., 1998; Gamboa and Alves, 2015) and seismicity (e.g., Shaw and Suppe, 1994; Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2014) within basins. Our synthesis of the interaction of normal faults and BPS is intended to shed light on geometrical aspects of associated fault\/fracture systems, and their implications for fracturing, seismicity, and fluid flow linked to numerous associated applications, such as radioactive waste disposal, carbon storage, hydrocarbon production and fluid injection operations.\nPrevious accounts of BPS in extensional settings are here compiled in a database which comprises 43 different study areas worldwide (Table 1\n). Most of the previous studies were primarily aimed at investigating normal fault geometry, with BPS identified and described in that context. This review provides an overview of the geometric and kinematic relationships between the BPS and normal faulting (Section 2), the mechanical conditions required for BPS in extensional settings (Section 3), the structural controls on its development (Section 4), and the magnitude, segmentation, and spatiotemporal distribution of the BPS planes (Section 5). We mainly focus on BPS studies from outcrop data where BPS is best observed, but also provide examples of BPS investigated from other types of data such as borehole, experimental and seismic reflection data.\n\n\n2\nGeometric and kinematic relationships between bed-parallel slip and normal faulting\nBed-parallel slip within an extensional fault system is often found to be geometrically and\/or kinematically associated with normal faulting (Figs. 1, 2 and 3\n\n\n). In this section, we explore the four main configurations identified in the literature between normal faulting and BPS (Fig. 2), as a backdrop to later considerations of the origin and structural controls on their formation.\n\n2.1\nNormal faults abutting BPS\nThere are several accounts of normal faults abutting BPS planes in the published literature (Table 1; Figs. 1a, b and 2a). In this configuration, normal faults are bounded vertically by the BPS surface(s) without being displaced by them (see selected examples in Fig. 4\n), a relationship suggesting that faults are mechanically linked to or retarded by BPS. Numerous studies have identified examples of spatially constrained arrays of normal faults accommodating displacement transfer between BPS planes. In this case, BPS are the primary structures, with the orientation and displacement of the normal faults governed by the direction and the magnitude of BPS, respectively. For example, Gross et al. (1997) described normal faults that are directly linked to BPS planes associated with flexural-slip folding in the Dead Sea rift (Figs. 1a, b, 4a). Delogkos et al. (2018) identified releasing relay zones and associated domino-style faults (e.g., antithetic to the overall sense of BPS) and \u201cconnecting\u201d normal faults (e.g., synthetic to the overall sense of BPS) that, together with the upper and lower BPS planes, form extensional duplexes exposed in intercalated lignite and marl deposits in the Ptolemais Basin (NW Greece) (Figs. 1a, b and 4d). Pedrera et al. (2012) described similar configurations in alternating sandy and silt layers in the Hu\u00e9rcal-Overa Basin (SE Spain) where minor normal faults bounded by BPS planes are interpreted to be part of a releasing overstep zone that eventually forms an extensional duplex structure.\nFurther examples of normal faults abutting BPS planes have been described by Roche et al. (2012, 2017) in alternating clay-rich and limestone layers exposed in the Mesozoic South-Eastern Basin of France (Fig. 4e). These studies also provided insights into the displacement evolution along the normal faults, which propagated and then abutted BPS planes while continued accumulating displacement resulting in high normal fault displacement gradients, a mechanism referred to as restriction by the authors. Microstructural analyses of the BPS planes in the same study areas have shown that BPS recorded successive tectonic events, which are expressed by recurrent crack-seal veins, pull-apart veins and stylolites (Lemonnier et al., 2020). In contrast, the BPS planes in Ptolemais Basin described by Delogkos et al. (2018) were not marked by associated fault rock or related mineral fill.\n\n\n2.2\nBPS abutting normal faults\nKinematic interaction between normal faulting and BPS can lead to a configuration where BPS planes are bounded laterally by normal fault(s) but without being displaced by them (Table 1; Figs. 1c, d and 2b). Examples of this configuration are provided in Fig. 5\n, including syn-kinematic BPS planes within tilted strata abutting against two synthetic bounding normal faults exposed in the Plio-Quaternary sedimentary series of the Zanjan Depression, Iran (Fig. 5b; Nabavi et al., 2020). A similar abutting relationship has been observed for strong synthetic rotation (i.e., down towards the hanging-wall) of beds and associated BPS planes within a strongly deformed narrow fault zone, with bounding normal faults accommodating a much larger throw (~120\u00a0m) along a fault near Moab, Utah, USA (Fig. 5c; Watterson et al., 1998). The associated space problem at fault-BPS plane intersections can be accommodated in other ways. For example, abutting contacts between synthetic rotated BPS planes and a normal fault are shown in Fig. 5d, where a straight footwall slip surface of the normal fault is separated from the overhanging steps on hanging-wall slip surface by a 15\u201330\u00a0cm thick shaley fault gouge at Round O Quarry, Lancashire, UK (Watterson et al., 1998).\n\n\n2.3\nBPS offsetting normal faults\nIdentifying BPS within extensional fault systems is challenging in the absence of appropriate offset markers such as faults (e.g., Alsop et al., 2020), veins (e.g., Ferrill et al., 2007), and dykes (e.g., Weinberger et al., 2016). When BPS offsets pre-existing structures, the resulting geometry is much simpler for veins and dykes (e.g., Figs. 1e and 3f), because they do not offset the layering to provide the complexity of structure sometimes accompanying normal faulting (Figs. 1g and 2c). An example of the former has been identified by Weinberger et al. (2016) in the Dead Sea Basin, in which vertical clastic dykes are displaced by BPS planes within a very shallow (<15\u00a0m) sequence consisting of aragonite and detrital-rich layers. In this case, a 1-m-thick shear zone consisting of up to 11 BPS planes with displacements of up to 60\u00a0cm on individual slip surfaces is attributed to near-surface deformation of a multilayer sequence during a single earthquake event.\nOffset of normal faults by BPS results in their segmentation and the formation of extensional (Fig. 2c(i)) or contractional (Fig. 2c(ii)) steps depending on the direction of BPS relative to the dip direction of the displaced normal fault. Particularly, when BPS displaces normal faults with a synthetic sense of movement (Figs. 2c(i), 6c, 6d and 6f), a stepped \u2018sawtooth\u2019 pattern is developed and part of the stratigraphic sequence is repeated, with older over younger stratigraphic relationships across the BPS plane (Delogkos et al., 2017; Alsop et al., 2020; Nabavi et al., 2020). In contrast, when BPS displaces a normal fault with an antithetic sense of movement (Figs. 2c(ii), 6a, 6b, 6e, 6f and 6g), a stepped \u2018staircase\u2019 pattern is developed, and part of the stratigraphic sequence is missing with younger over older stratigraphic relationships across the BPS plane. In both cases, the throw of the normal fault at the time of the BPS event can be estimated as it equals the thickness of the repeated or missing part of the stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 2c).\n\n\n2.4\nNormal faults offsetting BPS\nBecause normal faults are abundant and long-lived structures, the configuration of normal faulting offsetting BPS planes is expected to be the most common (Fig. 2d). However, due to the difficulty of identifying the presence of BPS planes in the absence of suitable pre-existing offset markers (i.e., faults and veins), clear evidence of normal faults offsetting BPS planes (Fig. 2d) has only been established in cases of multiple repetitions of normal faulting and BPS (Fig. 7). For example, Delogkos et al. (2017) demonstrated that BPS planes in Ptolemais Basin, NW Greece, were displaced several times by normal faults during their reactivation following offset by BPS. As expected, the resulted geometry at the intersection area between mutually offsetting BPS planes and normal faults is complicated. Fig. 7a illustrates one of these examples where a normal fault was initially displaced by BPS when its throw was ca. 1.5\u00a0m as indicated by the thickness of the repeated section within the fault zone. Subsequent reactivation of the normal fault resulted in the propagation of both, the upper and lower, fault segments, offset of the pre-existing BPS planes and the formation of a fault-bounded lens. A simpler case is shown in Fig. 7b where subsequent reactivation of the normal fault resulted in reactivation and propagation of only the lower fault segment and offset of the hanging-wall BPS plane (green layer). The triangular blocks in Fig. 7c represent former underhanging steps formed by BPS and subsequent reactivation of the initially planar fault slip surface (Watterson et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n3\nMechanical conditions required for BPS in extensional settings\nOur compilation of previous studies reveals that BPS can have a variety of origins in extensional settings (Table 1), which are summarised in Figs. 1 and 3. They comprise: (i) flexural-slip associated with fault-related folding (Figs. 1a, b, 3a and b), (ii) simple shear associated with bed rotation (Figs. 1c, d, 3c and d), (iii) tectonic movement along favourable rotated bed interfaces (Figs. 1g and 3e), (iv) gravity-driven downslope movement (Figs. 1g, 3a and e), and (v) co-seismic shaking (Figs. 1e and 3f). Here we provide a brief consideration of the mechanical conditions required for BPS in extensional settings, as a backdrop to a more detailed description of each of those origins in the next section.\nIn an extensional regime, the maximum far-field principal stress is vertical. Depending on the magnitudes of the effective stresses, fracturing under this regime typically produces three different types of fractures: (i) vertical fractures opening normal to the minimum principal stress due to tensile failure, (ii) 60\u00b0-70\u00b0 dipping normal faults due to compressional shear failure, and (ii) hybrid fractures with differing amounts of dilation formed under a mixed tensile and compressive stress state (e.g., Hancock, 1985; Ramsey and Chester, 2004; Ferrill et al., 2012a, 2012b; Fig. 8a). In this context, the development of BPS in strata that are moderate to shallowly dipping (i.e., < 50\u00b0) involves shearing at a high angle to the maximum far-field principal stress and appears to be inconsistent with the expectations of classic fracture mechanics. Although determination of the exact stress conditions producing individual cases of BPS is not possible, there are several factors which can together contribute to BPS formation, the most important of which are: (1) strength anisotropy coupled with bed rotation, (2) stress rotation, and (3) fluid overpressure.\nBPS is typically encountered within foliated and stratified anisotropic rocks where the strength properties parallel to bedding are likely weaker than in other directions (i.e., low friction and cohesion). Laboratory tests demonstrate that in extensional stress conditions slip can occur along surfaces with dips as low as 30\u00b0 with transecting normal faults only dominating when anisotropies have dips\u00a0shallower than ca. 30\u00b0 (e.g., Donath, 1961; Niandou et al., 1997; Khanlari et al., 2015; Fig. 8b). Consequently, within extensional basins, in which the maximum principal stress is vertical, mechanically anisotropic sequences with moderate-steep bed dips (>30\u00b0) will be prone to BPS. While this mechanism alone may explain some examples of BPS (see Section 4.4), in other cases departures of the maximum principal stress from vertical can promote BPS initiation even at lower bed dips. These circumstances will apply when the deformation of bedded sequences is accommodated locally by the partitioning of pure or simple shear components that are oblique to the far-field stresses. For example, flexural-slip folding associated with normal faulting (Figs. 1a, b and 8c; see Section 4.1) and the deformation of host rock sequences within fault zones and relays (Fig. 1c and d) in which a combination of simple shear and pure shear, arising from bed rotation and associated fault zone narrowing, provides a local stress field that can be rotated to very high angles relative to the far-field (Fig. 8d and e; Sanderson and Manchini, 1984; see Section 4.2). Arising from these rotations bedding can accommodate the slips predicted along equivalent conjugate faults within the prevailing stress orientations (Fig. 8f). Lastly, fluid overpressure may further decrease the angle of stability of bedding by partly supporting overburden pressures and reducing the frictional resistance of the bedding planes as fluid pressures approach lithostatic (Hubbert and Rubey, 1959; Healy, 2009). The development of overpressures within basinal sequences typically occurs when compaction-related pressures cannot be dissipated by fluid flow, particularly within low permeability units, such as shales and clays. These circumstances will facilitate BPS, sometimes with the generation of BPS-dominated gravitational sliding (Cobbold et al., 2004; see Section 4.3). The foregoing discussion indicates, therefore, that a variety of conditions that are relatively common within layered basinal sequences can promote the formation of BPS associated with normal faulting, a suggestion which is developed further in the next section.\n\n\n4\nStructural controls on the development of BPS\nThe foregoing section has outlined some of the main factors relating to the prevailing stress conditions associated with BPS in extensional settings. Despite the apparent paradox of combining normal faults and BPS, these considerations highlight how normal faulting within sedimentary basins will inevitably be accompanied by BPS. In this section we investigate some of the associated processes in more detail.\n\n4.1\nFlexural-slip folding\nFlexural-slip is a deformation mechanism that has been widely applied in compressional settings for accommodating folds in layered sequences through the initiation of syn-folding slip along bedding planes (Ramsay, 1974; Tanner, 1989). Outcrop analysis of BPS associated with flexural-slip folding has shown: (a) a correlation between the fold style parameters (e.g., fold curvature, shape, interlimb angle) and the amount of slip, (b) a systematic change in the magnitude of flexural-slip from a maximum along the fold limb to zero at the fold hinges and (c) bedding slip directions (defined from slickenlines and slickenfibres) are near orthogonal to the fold hinge and, in the absence of overturned bedding, have a reverse sense of shear that changes across the fold hinges (Tanner, 1989, 1992; Suppe, 1985; Fowler, 1996; Fagereng and Byrnes, 2015; S\u00e9journ\u00e9 et al., 2005).\nFlexural-slip folding is the principal origin of bed-parallel slip identified in extensional tectonic settings (Table 1). Among the different forms of folding that can exist in extensional settings (e.g., Hamblin, 1965; Shelton, 1984; Barnett et al., 1987; Walsh and Watterson, 1987; Withjack et al., 1990; Gawthorpe et al., 1997; Sharp et al., 2000; Grasemann et al., 2005; Childs et al., 2017; Rowan et al., 2020), fault-propagation folds (Fig. 3a) are most often reported to accommodate BPS (Table 1). In this case, folds with axes sub-parallel to fault strike develop above the upper tip, or in some cases below the lower tip, of a propagating normal fault (e.g., Barnett et al., 1987; Grasemann et al., 2005; Ferrill et al., 2007; Childs et al., 2017; Coleman et al., 2019). These folds are also considered to be the precursory deformation responsible for the presence of normal drag directly adjacent to a normal fault (e.g., Walsh and Watterson, 1987; Grasemann et al., 2005; Ferrill et al., 2012a, 2012b) suggesting the potential presence of BPS associated with normal drag. An example of BPS associated with fault-propagation folding in Sierra Del Carmen Mountain range in west Texas, USA, has been analysed in detail by Ferrill et al. (2007). In this case a monocline is developed above a propagating normal fault with a displacement on the order of 100\u2013500\u00a0m (Fig. 9a). The folded limestone and shale sequence includes bed-perpendicular veins accommodating bed-parallel extension, and a series of BPS planes with an up-dip sense of shear offsetting the veins with a maximum displacement of 63\u00a0cm. These deformation features are mostly concentrated in the monoclinal limb, where the maximum intensity of flexural-slip folding is expected (Fig. 9a). Further increase of the displacement and propagation of the underlying normal fault can eventually result in breaching of the fold (e.g., Sharp et al., 2000), making it difficult to identify the presence and origin of BPS.\nBPS associated with flexural-slip folding has also been attributed to hanging-wall rollover anticlines (Table 1; Fig. 3b), a reverse drag feature associated with both planar and listric faults (e.g., Hamblin, 1965; Shelton, 1984; Barnett et al., 1987; Stein et al., 1988). Delogkos et al. (2018) examined the nature of BPS arising from a hanging-wall rollover anticline on a km-scale displacement normal fault in Ptolemais Basin, NW Greece. In this case, flexural-slip along the hanging-wall rollover was accommodated by 78 BPS planes with an up-dip sense of movement that can be observed within the 110\u00a0m of exposed stratigraphic sequence composed mainly from alternations of relatively thin lignite and marl beds. A previous study by Watterson et al. (1998) provided estimations of the contribution that wall-rock steps arising from BPS due to hanging-wall rollover anticlines may have on fault rock thickness.\nThe characteristic feature of the flexural-slip models already presented is BPS with an up-dip sense of shear, but there are other models which generate down-dip shear. For example, based on analogue models aiming to replicate fault propagation folding, Withjack et al. (1990) described a folded multilayer sequence above a normal fault that has been affected by BPS with two opposed senses of shearing. In this case, one BPS plane has an up-dip sense of movement which is attributed to the flexural-slip folding (i.e., lower BPS plane in Fig. 3a), while the other BPS plane has a down-dip sense of shear which is attributed to have a tectonic origin by accommodating lateral transfer of extension (i.e., upper BPS plane in Fig. 3a). This lateral transfer of extension is also accommodated by secondary high-angle normal faults which are located upslope, above the BPS plane and are connected to it (e.g., Fig. 3a). Natural examples of BPS planes with a down-dip sense of shear within fault-propagation folds have also been identified by Sharp et al. (2000) and Jackson et al. (2006) in the syn- and pre-rift sequences in the Suez Rift, Egypt (Fig. 4b).\nIn his classic study of listric faults with detachments, Gibbs (1984) highlighted that antithetic faults located at the hanging-wall rollover can detach on bedding surfaces and, therefore, generate a down-dip sense of BPS, which is in contrast with the flexural-slip mechanism that has an up-dip sense of movement. Another example of a down-dip sense of BPS associated with hanging-wall rollover anticlines attributed to listric faults has been identified by Higgs et al. (1991) within the Sevier fault system in southwestern Utah, USA. These authors did not attribute this contrasting sense of movement to a tectonic or a gravitational origin (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3), but to a different flexural-slip mechanism that assumes the extensional fault plane acts as the finite neutral surface of the fold, with associated bed-parallel slip extending well beyond the associated hanging-wall rollover anticline, a boundary condition we consider geometrically unlikely. The associated down-dip sense of movement contrasts with the up-dip sense arising from more conventional models involving conservation of bed length and thickness within the hanging-wall block and pinning of the beds at the outer limit of the hanging-wall rollover (Rowan and Kligfield, 1989; Watterson et al., 1998; Delogkos et al., 2018).\n\n\n4.2\nSimple shear associated with bed rotations between interacting faults\nSimple shear is a deformation in which the parallel planes of a translated body remain parallel and maintain a constant distance, while translating relative to each other (e.g., Ramsay, 1980). In the case of two parallel interacting fault slip surfaces, the shear movements on the faults result in rotation of the beds and associated bed-parallel slip with up-dip movements between the bounding faults (Fig. 3c and d). The bed rotation can be associated with either synthetic or antithetic bed rotations between kinematically interacting parallel fault surfaces, i.e., see Fig. 3c and d, respectively. The shear between bounding fault surfaces can lead to local stresses with very different orientations to those of the far-field, circumstances which can strongly favour the localisation of BPS (Fig. 8d and e). The resulting structure has been described by Watterson et al. (1998), as similar to a kink-band but without the same geometric constraints, as the bounding faults effectively provide free surfaces. Watterson et al. (1998) provided outcrop examples of BPS accommodating shear between closely spaced interacting faults suggesting that, in this case, BPS, which is associated with the bed rotations, contributes to the transfer of displacement between the bounding fault surfaces (Figs. 3c, d and 5c). A recent study by Nabavi et al. (2020) has also shown an outcrop example of syn-kinematic BPS related to synthetic tilting of the strata within a vertically segmented normal fault zone (Fig. 5b). In these cases, the space problems associated with abutting BPS and normal faults, will be accommodated by a variety of deformation mechanisms, including cataclastic and plastic flow of host rocks and\/or faults rocks, pressure solution and veining, depending on the lithological properties of the host rock sequence and the boundary conditions.\nThe simple shear model and the flexural-slip model discussed previously are both related to bed rotations that result in an up-dip sense of bed-parallel slip. These two models can therefore be difficult to distinguish. However, according to Watterson et al. (1998), their main difference is on the slip distribution along the BPS planes which is discussed in detail in Section 5.3.\n\n\n4.3\nGravity-driven movement\nBPS associated with gravity-driven normal faulting (Fig. 3e) occurs when downslope shear movement is activated on rotated bedding planes due to gravitational forces. Gravity-driven BPS has been widely recognised in mass-transport deposits, in which a strong association with normal faulting characterises the extension-dominated upslope region of such systems (e.g., Bull et al., 2009). Aspects of the formation and kinematics of mass-transport deposits and the associated basal shear surfaces have been well described from both seismic reflection and outcrop data (e.g., Bull et al., 2009; Alsop and Marco, 2011; Sobiesiak et al., 2018), with recent studies (Table 1) identifying the development of internal BPS planes. For example, Gamboa and Alves (2015) integrated observations from a 3D seismic reflection dataset from SE Brazil, and outcrop data from SE Crete, Greece, and demonstrated that BPS can develop within mass-transport blocks during their downslope movement, with important potential implications for internal fluid flow pathways. Evidence of BPS within mass-transport deposits can sometimes also be provided by borehole data, with, for example, BPS identified down to depths of 86\u00a0m within gravitationally deformed shales and sandstones in onshore Japan (Chigira et al., 2013). Detailed field analysis of BPS within mass-transport deposits along the western margin of the Dead Sea Basin (Alsop et al., 2020), has indicated the prevalence of multiple internal BPS planes with displacements of up to tens of centimetres and a characteristic downslope movement towards the depocenter of the basin (Fig. 6a). This study highlighted that whilst BPS planes may have limited displacements, their cumulative effects within the mass-transport deposits have significant implications for the accommodation and estimation of extension and contraction within gravity-driven systems. Because BPS due to gravity-driven downslope movements is associated with slope instabilities, the prevalence of this deformation will vary with location and depth, with its development expected to be accentuated at shallower burial depths within basin margins. Identification of BPS with a downslope sense of movement does not, however, require that deformation is gravity-driven, since it could also have a tectonic-driven origin (see Section 4.4).\n\n\n4.4\nPost-rotation BPS localisation\nAs we have shown in Section 3, bed-parallel slip can be promoted by the tilting of bedding planes so that they are activated as slip surfaces due to their favourable orientation relative to the local or far-field stresses (Fig. 3e). This process of activation is sensitive to orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal stresses and to the mechanical properties of the faulted sequence (e.g., Ferrill et al., 1998). BPS due to tectonic or gravity-driven movement are both likely to have a downslope sense of movement. However, while gravitational driven BPS is expected at shallow depths (see Section 4.3), tectonic activation of bedding planes can also be expected at greater depths depending on the frictional properties of the bedding planes and the magnitude of the driven stresses (e.g., Morris et al., 1996; Ferrill et al., 1998). Tectonic activation of BPS has been proposed by Ferrill et al. (1998) to explain BPS observed at Bare Mountain, Nevada, USA (Fig. 6b). In this case, fault blocks provide bedding planes that are progressively rotated until BPS is initiated due to the higher slip tendency of bedding planes, arising from the increasing obliquity with the maximum principal stress direction. Activation of the bedding planes as slip surfaces has also been reported in tilted Carboniferous turbidites during Triassic rift-related faulting in Sagres, Portugal (Fossen, 2020).\nBeyond these two examples, we speculate that activation of bedding planes as slip surfaces is also possible in areas of high crustal stretching. Existing models for crustal stretching envisage progressive extension along fault systems generally involving rotating fault blocks downthrown towards the locus of crustal thinning. In these circumstances existing models suggest that the progressively lower dips of normal faults, and an associated increase in normal stress (\u03c3n), leads to their deactivation and the generation of a newly formed set of steeper faults (e.g., Proffett Jr, 1977; Jackson, 1987; Reston, 2005). Whilst these newly formed faults are also generally considered to dip in the same direction as the earlier set of faults, the earlier rotation of bedding within fault blocks will provide anisotropy that dips at angles greater than the rotations of original faults. For the high crustal stretching factor (\u03b2) values typical of stretched crust approaching the generation of oceanic crust (e.g., \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02\u20133) bed rotations in excess of 45\u00b0 are to be expected, circumstances which will make the activation of bedding planes as slip surfaces (e.g., generation of opposed dipping faults) more favourable than the generation of new synthetic faults (see also Section 3). This will lead to the generation of a conjugate fault system as crustal stretching proceeds, a scenario that is envisaged in some crustal stretching models (Bayrakci et al., 2016; Lymer et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.5\nSimple shear associated with co-seismic shaking\nBPS can also be related to horizontal simple shear associated with co-seismic shaking (Fig. 3f). To the best of our knowledge, the only account of BPS formed due to co-seismic shaking in extensional settings has been identified by Weinberger et al. (2016) in the Dead Sea Basin. In this case, vertical clastic dykes are displaced by BPS planes within a very shallow (<15\u00a0m) sequence consisting of aragonite and detrital-rich layers. A 1-m-thick shear zone consisting of up to 11 BPS planes with displacements of up to 60\u00a0cm on individual slip surfaces is attributed to a single co-seismic event. Weinberger et al. (2016) suggested that BPS can accommodate co-seismic shaking, a scenario that can be promoted at shallow depths in a multilayer sequence where enhanced tensile stresses and lower vertical stresses (\u03c31) can lead to mechanical decoupling along bedding planes and gravity sliding.\n\n\n\n5\nMagnitude, segmentation, and distribution of bed-parallel slip\n\n5.1\nMagnitude of bed-parallel slip\nThe magnitude of BPS typically ranges from a few millimetres up to a few meters, and is of the same order for all different origins of BPS associated with normal fault systems (Fig. 10\n; Table 1). We recognise, however, that our compiled quantitative dataset, which mainly comprises data from outcrop datasets (Table 1), is subject to a sampling bias that limits the range of observed magnitudes of BPS, the nature of which is discussed further in this section.\nEven in outcrop exposures where detailed observations can be made, identifying and measuring BPS can often be challenging. In the absence of steep-vertical markers, faults are much easier to observe within sedimentary sequences and because they are the pre-eminent driver of associated structures (e.g., folds and BPS), their kinematics are easier to define and unravel than the smaller and more enigmatic BPS. In addition, faults will often transect and offset BPS planes, making them even more challenging to recognise (see Section 2.4). For example, analysis of BPS from the Ptolemais Basin benefits from large-scale open-cast mine exposures supporting the localised nature of BPS with m-scale slips, which are metres to decametres apart (Delogkos et al., 2017, 2018; Childs et al., 2020). Even in that area the presence of BPS remained elusive for the first couple of years during the mapping of fault zone structure, only becoming clear because of the remarkable stratigraphic definition of the faulted sequence and the absence of cataclasis and fault rock generation destroying fault-BPS contacts within unlithified host rocks deformed at relatively shallow depths of faulting (< ca. 200\u00a0m). Without those conditions identifying BPS will be very difficult in normal fault-BPS systems where faults are the principal structures both in terms of their displacement and longevity, and where contemporaneous BPS must step across contemporaneous faults. Similar conclusions were derived from the analysis of gravity slides within the Dead Sea rift, with Alsop et al. (2020) suggesting that based on their inability to correlate the displaced markers at outcrop scale, BPS planes could potentially have magnitudes in the order of 10's metres, potentially with multiple BPS planes complicating the estimation of extension and\/or contraction in gravity-driven systems.\nA potential means of investigating larger-scale BPS is from the analysis of seismic reflection data, but those data are arguably subject to even more significant resolution effects. For example, even fault zones accommodating 1\u00a0km scale displacements do not have sufficient content to be imaged seismically and are only mappable from offset horizons. It is therefore expected that BPS, which are likely to be intrinsically localised and do not offset horizons, will be even more challenging to identify. Despite these concerns, the presence of BPS from seismic reflection data of submarine mass-transport deposits in offshore Esp\u00edrito Santo, SE Brazil, has been advocated by Gamboa and Alves (2015), although their magnitude was not defined. Here we present an interpreted seismic line of a potential example of BPS associated with a normal fault system in the Inner Moray Firth, North Sea (Fig. 11\n; Iacopini et al., 2016). Although it has not been proposed by the authors, this interpretation suggests the presence of large-scale BPS. On first inspection this fault looks like a cross-section of a conventional relay zone, in which the pair of fault surfaces at the lower part of the section could be bounding structures to a breached relay zone seen in map view (e.g., Peacock and Sanderson, 1991; Childs et al., 1995, 1996). However, closer examination of the interpreted seismic line highlights the key geometric characteristics associated with fault segmentation due to BPS (Delogkos et al., 2017). For example, the displacement gradients at the tips of the relay bounding fault segments are infinite, especially for the hanging-wall fault segment that juxtaposes the yellow unit (Fig. 11). This is accompanied by repetition of part of the stratigraphic sequence (i.e., the red unit in Fig. 11), with associated abrupt changes in the displacement gradients at the bounding fault segments. Following BPS, it also appears that the footwall fault segment was reactivated and propagated upwards displacing the BPS surface. Based on this interpretation, the estimated magnitude of BPS in this case is ca. 300\u00a0m which equals the separation distance between apparent relay bounding fault segments. Detailed restorations of very similar geometries of alternating normal faulting and bed-parallel slip have been presented by Delogkos et al. (2017) for meter-scale, outcrop-based examples. Whilst we anticipate that future analysis will highlight the presence of intermediate BPS magnitudes, between this seismic example and those of our outcrop datasets (e.g., > 4.5\u00a0m and\u00a0<\u00a0300\u00a0m; Fig. 10), their identification might be challenging due to the limitations in scale and resolution of both data sources.\n\n\n5.2\nRelationship between BPS, bed rotation and bed thickness\nA quantitative consideration of the magnitude of BPS can be performed by comparing empirical constraints derived from a selection of datasets with conceptual models of BPS. A sense of the scale of BPS associated with faults can be defined for simple geometric models of the structural controls we described in Section 4, including flexural-slip associated with both fault propagation folds or hanging-wall rollover anticlines, and simple shear arising from bed rotations between interacting faults. For simplicity, we investigate models with sequences assumed to have constant bed thickness and equally spaced BPS surfaces, with angular bed rotations measured from a horizontal regional (Fig. 12). Whilst in practice natural multi-layered sequences are likely to be marked by BPS which varies with bed thickness and with the properties of potential slip surfaces, the simple models presented give a sense of the scale of slip relative to bed thickness and rotations. Estimated BPS are considered maxima because no account is taken of bed rotations accommodated by other, more ductile, processes in natural systems (e.g., compaction, pressure solution, buckling). Results are presented for bed thicknesses from 1\u00a0cm up to 100\u00a0m and for bed dips of up to 45\u00b0, which exceeds the ca. 20\u00b0 maximum bed dips for all but two of the natural examples presented in this paper (Fig. 12). These exceptions are relatively high strain examples of a fault propagation fold, the Big Brushy Canyon monocline, adjacent to a 75\u00a0m displacement normal fault (Fig. 9) within the West Texas extensional corridor (Ferrill et al., 2007) and a fault zone along Bridger Jack Mesa fault (Fig. 5c), a 120\u00a0m displacement normal fault within the Paradox Basin, Utah. For both the flexure and simple shear models there is a linear relationship between BPS and bed thickness for a constant bed rotation angle, and between BPS and bed rotation angle for a constant bed thickness, such that\n\n(1)\n\ns\n=\ntan\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u2217\nt\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 12 shows the magnitude of BPS (s) on individual bedding planes within a multilayer sequence with bed thicknesses (t) and rotations (\u03b8). Thick bedded sequences (1\u201310\u00a0m) will have BPS of ca. 0.3\u20133\u00a0m for bed dips of up to 20\u00b0, and 0.1\u20131\u00a0m for bed dips up to 5\u00b0, whilst thin bedded sequences (<10\u00a0cm) will have BPS of <4\u00a0cm for 20\u00b0 bed dips and\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0cm for 5\u00b0 bed dips. The range of BPS values compares well with those expected for the bed dips and bed thicknesses in the examples presented in this review, though the lowest BPS values predicted are slightly lower than those observed. We attribute this difference to two principal effects, the difficulty of confidently defining cm-scale BPS given the complex structure of combined fault-BPS systems and the likelihood that there will not be an equivalence between bed thickness and the spacing of BPS (see also Sections 5.5 and 5.6). The latter arises from the fact that only selected bedding planes are likely to become the locus for slip and some will accommodate more slip than others, an established feature of fracture localisation within other systems (Kakimi, 1980; Wojtal, 1986; Childs et al., 1990; Gillespie et al., 1993). Whilst the rather limited range of BPS (a few centimetres up to 4.5\u00a0m) in natural systems is attributed to sampling bias and localisation, the observational constraints are nevertheless in line with the simple models presented. This is illustrated for a single dataset of a fault-propagation fold investigated by Ferrill et al. (2007) in which BPS was measured for different bed dips across a hanging-wall monocline (Fig. 9a). Correlation between bed dip and BPS is consistent with flexural slip decreasing towards fold hinges and increasing towards steepened limbs. This change was defined by measuring the slip-thickness ratio of BPS-bed thickness pairs, a measure equivalent to the shear strain developed across a given layer (Ferrill et al., 2007). In this case, the prevailing bed thickness of ca. 1\u20132\u00a0m provides a slip of up to 0.63\u00a0m, an estimate which is close to the predicted BPS value of ca. 0.58\u20131.15\u00a0m.\nAlthough the dip of the beds is likely to be a key control on the magnitude of BPS, there are some cases that it appears not to be the case. For example, the magnitude of BPS of up to 0.6\u00a0m along individual slip planes identified in the Lisan formation, cannot be related to high bed dips as in this case the bed dip is less than one degree (Weinberger et al., 2016). Nevertheless, BPS in this case is due to simple shear associated with co-seismic shaking, and our conceptual model is designed to make predictions of BPS magnitudes only for BPS due to flexural-slip folding and simple shear associated with bed rotations between interacting faults (Fig. 12).\n\n\n5.3\nSlip distribution along bed-parallel slip planes\nIn the previous section the range of BPS in extensional settings was discussed but without considering the spatial variations in BPS on individual planes. Delogkos et al. (2018) highlighted that the slip along individual BPS planes associated with flexural-slip is not constant, but instead varies from a maximum value approximately at the centre of the BPS plane to zero towards its tip. Fig. 9b shows a displacement profile along a ca. 500\u00a0m long BPS plane with a maximum slip of 2.9\u00a0m progressively decreasing towards the lateral tips. From a relatively limited range of slip magnitudes this study also highlighted a positive correlation between the maximum slip and length of BPS planes, with a slip to length ratio of ca. 0.016 falling within the range of the published values for other types of faults (e.g., Kim et al., 2004).\nThe notion of variable slip along BPS planes (e.g.,\u00a0Fig. 13a and b) is consistent with observational constraints indicating that the overall magnitude of BPS varies with the dip of the bedding, as supported by data from the normal fault-related Big Brushy Canyon propagation fold (Fig. 9a). The same flexural-slip model was previously advocated in compressional settings where an increase in the slip magnitude typically occurs from the fold hinge to the limbs (Suppe, 1985; Tanner, 1989) and in extensional settings, associated with hanging-wall rollover anticlines, in which BPS increases from zero at the fold hinge, where the beds are pinned, to a maximum towards the master fault (Fig. 13b; Watterson et al., 1998). Whilst discontinuous BPS planes will usually reflect the changing boundary conditions from fold limbs to hinges, we also suggest that even within fold limbs with constant bed dips, BPS will be discontinuous, in the same way that other types of fractures are discontinuous, particularly at the early stages of fracture system evolution (Elliott, 1976; Walsh and Watterson, 1987). In other circumstances, the discontinuous nature of BPS may be very similar to that of segmented fault surfaces that are strongly kinematically linked, and may even be physically linked via relay structures, a scenario which is considered in the next section. By contrast, the magnitude of BPS due to the simple shear associated with bed rotations between interacting faults is expected to be constant along the BPS planes (Fig. 13c; Watterson et al., 1998) with an increase in magnitude as the slip planes rotate (Watterson et al., 1998; Ferrill et al., 1998).\n\n\n5.4\nSegmented nature of the bed-parallel slip planes\nBPS is often accommodated by zones of multiple slip planes (Wilson et al., 2009; Weinberger et al., 2016) where slip is partitioned and transferred between the different slip planes. An example of displacement transfer is illustrated in Fig. 14a where one metre of slip is transferred between two BPS planes (green and blue) that have a separation of ca. 1\u00a0m and an overlap of ca. 20\u00a0m (Delogkos et al., 2018). In this case, the BPS planes are segmented parallel to the slip direction but there are other cases where segmentation of the BPS planes is normal to the slip direction (e.g., Gross et al., 1997; Horne and Culshaw, 2001; Ferrill et al., 2007; Perritt and Roberts, 2007; Delogkos et al., 2018). As a consequence, in a similar fashion to faults (Walsh et al., 1999) depending on the relative slip direction and the sense of stepping, segmentation of the BPS planes can result in neutral (Figs. 1f and 15a), releasing (Figs. 1a, b and 15b) or restraining (Figs. 1e and 15c) relay zones. In the case of releasing relay zones, episodic slip and dilation can result in rhombohedral or lenticular veins filled by mineralisation and crack seals (e.g., Fig. 14b and c; Ferrill et al., 2007; Lemonnier et al., 2020).\nThe transfer of slip between the BPS planes can also be partly accommodated by minor normal faults which can be synthetic (Figs. 1b, 4a, c and bottom cartoon in 15b) or antithetic (Figs. 1a, 4d and top cartoon in 15b) to the BPS movement. Synthetic or \u2018connecting\u2019 normal faults are found to be associated with either neutral (Horne and Culshaw, 2001; Perritt and Roberts, 2007) or releasing relay zones (Gross et al., 1997; Ferrill et al., 2007; Delogkos et al., 2018). Antithetic or domino-style normal faults are found to be associated only with releasing relay zones (Delogkos et al., 2018). To our knowledge, there is no minor faulting (either synthetic or antithetic) associated with transfer of BPS in restraining relay zones. Finally, it is worth noting that the releasing relay zones appear to be much more common than restraining relays along the BPS planes in extensional settings (Ferrill et al., 2007; Delogkos et al., 2018), which is the opposite to what is observed for the BPS planes in contractional settings (Tanner, 1989, 1992; Horne and Culshaw, 2001).\n\n\n5.5\nSpatiotemporal distribution of bed-parallel slip\nOur geometric models of BPS have considered constant bed thickness sequences associated with constant slip BPS planes (Section 5.2). These simplifying assumptions are useful insofar as they provide a means of estimating the potential scale of slip on planes that are a certain thickness apart. There are, however, compelling grounds for suggesting that the computed slips are best considered to relate to mechanical units, rather than individual beds, and that the spacing between BPS is neither uniform nor simple. For example, previous work has shown that multiple BPS planes can be spatially distributed and\/or localised on a wide range of stratigraphic scales. Becker (1994) identified 8 BPS planes developed in association with fault propagation folding of a 550-m-thick Cretaceous sequence in the Ramon National Geological Park, Israel. At a much smaller scale, Weinberger et al. (2016) identified a zone of up to 11 BPS planes associated with co-seismic shaking, which can be continuously traced for more than 20\u00a0m and are localised within a metre-thick stratigraphic interval (average spacing of ca. 10\u00a0cm) consisting of aragonite and detrital-rich layers of the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation in the Dead Sea Basin. At an intermediate scale, Delogkos et al. (2018) reported that the distance between adjacent BPS planes ranges from a few centimetres up to 60\u00a0m with an average spacing of 13\u00a0m within the lignite\/marl sequence in Ptolemais Basin, NW Greece. This evidence indicates that BPS are not distributed across all beds but are instead localised onto fewer planes presumably bounding discrete mechanical units. Whilst the localisation of BPS is likely to be controlled by a combination of bed thickness and mechanical stratigraphy, with slip localising preferentially on weaker layers bounding thicker and stronger units (e.g., Tanner, 1989; Higgs et al., 1991; Khalil and McClay, 2017), there are many other issues which will complicate any such relationship. It is anticipated, for example, that BPS could become stratigraphically more pervasive with time and increasing strain, with a decrease in the spacing of BPS planes accompanying the activation of new slip planes arising from fold tightening and progressive deformation. Evidence of equivalent decreases in spacing has been documented from earlier studies of BPS due to flexural-slip folding in contractional settings (Tanner, 1989; Fowler and Winsor, 1997; Horne and Culshaw, 2001). We suggest also that the segmented nature of BPS (see Section 5.4) demands that the spatial distribution of BPS within a rock volume will be highly variable in all directions (i.e., parallel and normal to slip direction) and will also vary with time as the segmented system localises. Another reason for expecting more complex arrangements of BPS is the kinematic interaction between BPS and normal faulting, an issue which is considered below (see Section 5.6).\n\n\n5.6\nEffects on magnitude, segmentation, and distribution of BPS due to the interaction with normal faulting\nThus far we have considered simple models for the distribution in BPS through a stratigraphic sequence, but without having considered the implications of their kinematic interaction. The distribution, spacing and magnitude of BPS is, however, likely to be strongly affected by the contemporaneous and mutually cross-cutting nature of BPS and normal faulting. Two main models have been advanced for the geometric and kinematic consequences of this interaction. In the conceptual model shown in Fig. 16a (Delogkos et al., 2018), pre-existing BPS planes (Stage 1) are displaced by normal faults (Stage 2), with subsequent reactivation of the BPS planes resulting in their lateral propagation and offset of the normal faults (Stage 3). The original distribution of the BPS planes has, therefore, been changed, with their final spacing partly depending on the throw of normal faults prior to reactivation of BPS. The net effect of this interaction is that the cumulative magnitude of BPS is eventually partitioned onto more BPS planes. Because this process can repeat several times (i.e., Stage 4), it can result in the clustering of what might originally have been regularly spaced BPS planes. This process is further complicated by the connectivity issues arising from the variable displacements across normal faults and BPS planes, which will provide even more complex geometries. These processes are considered to be partly responsible for the BPS clustering observed in the exposed sequence of Ptolemais FM, in Ptolemais Basin, NW Greece (Delogkos et al., 2018), for which outcrop examples and their associated geometric restorations (Fig. 16a) have been presented by Delogkos et al. (2017).\nAn alternative conceptual model for the distribution and magnitude of BPS planes is shown in Fig. 16b (Gross et al., 1997). In this case, however, contemporaneous normal faulting and associated block rotations provide a basis for localising BPS onto fewer and more widely spaced planes with time. BPS is initially distributed across numerous planes throughout the section (Stage 1). Strain accumulation leads to the formation of normal faulting between some of the BPS planes. These normal faults are kinematically related to the BPS planes, and therefore, they are abutted by them as described in Section 2.1. Furthermore, associated block rotation between the bounding BPS planes, in turn, leads to deactivation of the BPS planes that are displaced by the normal faults (Stage 2). BPS is then no longer accommodated by the planes located within these rotated blocks, but instead localised onto planes bounding these rotating blocks (Stage 3). This process of BPS localisation can gradually repeat at larger scales resulting in the development of larger rotated blocks, deactivation of associated BPS planes and wider spacing of the active BPS planes (Stage 4).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nIn this section, we first discuss the potential for the widespread development of BPS within extensional settings despite the relatively limited attention they have received to date. We then explore the implications of our study and make suggestions for future research.\n\n6.1\nHow common is bed-parallel slip in extensional settings?\nThe most common origin of BPS in extensional settings is the flexural-slip folding (Table 1). Given that deformation due to movement on normal faults is commonly accommodated partly by folding of the strata surrounding the faults, we would expect BPS to exist where any form of folding in extensional settings occurs. The examples of BPS identified in this study are associated with fault propagation and fault-bend folding, and the formation of hanging-wall rollover anticlines (Table 1). Seismic reflection and outcrop-based studies have, however, identified a wide variety of fold types associated with normal faulting, with the folds displaying various orientations, amplitudes and wavelengths relative to normal fault planes. We would therefore expect BPS to occur in association with fault-bend folding (e.g., Groshong Jr, 1989; Withjack and Schlische, 2006; Delogkos et al., 2020; McHarg et al., 2020), normal and reverse drag folds (e.g., Hamblin, 1965; Barnett et al., 1987; Doutsos and Koukouvelas, 1998; Grasemann et al., 2005), including footwall anticlines and hanging-wall synclines associated with the along-strike variations in fault displacement (e.g., Schlische, 1995) and salt-related folding (e.g., Rowan et al., 2020). The fact that there are very few accounts within the published literature of BPS associated with folding is, however, attributed to observational bias arising from the paucity of steeply dipping markers that can highlight their presence.\nThe steepening of bed dips associated with fault zones and relay zones also provides an important basis for the generation of BPS. Bed rotations within fault-bounded zones can provide bed dips in excess of 45\u00b0, with relay ramps accommodating bed rotations of up to 30\u00b0 prior to relay breaching. In many basins these deformations may not be as aerially extensive as flexural-slip folding, but they can lead to high shear strains of the intervening sequences and provide an excellent means of localising BPS. Whilst definition of BPS can, in this case, sometimes be defined by the mutual offsetting of faults and BPS, recognition of its significance and scale is complicated by the associated complexity of structure and requires excellent outcrop constraints, where possible complemented by numerical modelling (e.g., Imber et al., 2004).\nIn terms of the nature of the host rock sequence that BPS would be expected to occur within, BPS is often identified in stratigraphic sequences with a strong mechanical contrast (Table 1), with a clear tendency of BPS to be predominantly accommodated by weak layers, independently of its origin (Salehy et al., 1977; Ferrill et al., 1998, 2007; Jackson et al., 2006). For example, Higgs et al. (1991) identified BPS planes within the mudstone horizon of a bedded unit comprising interbedded mudstones and sandstones of the Triassic Moenkopi Formation, associated with a hanging-wall rollover anticline. Khalil and McClay (2017) described BPS planes in incompetent thin-bedded shale dominated units associated with fault-propagation folding. The preferential location of BPS in weak units has also been attributed to the anisotropic properties of these layers that can promote slip parallel to the bedding (e.g., Ferrill et al., 1998). Alsop et al. (2020) highlighted that the location of BPS can also be controlled by the presence of competent or gypsum-rich units that have the ability to trap underlying fluids resulting in the localisation of the BPS planes directly beneath them. However, BPS has also been identified in relatively mechanically homogeneous sequences. Delogkos et al. (2017 and 2018) identified numerous BPS planes in a uniformly weak and relatively homogeneous sequence consisting of rhythmic alternations of m-scale lignite and lacustrine marl beds, and they suggested that the lack of significant mechanical heterogeneity is consistent with an even distribution of BPS through the exposed section.\nIn summary, BPS is expected to exist in all multi-layered host rock sequences, irrespective of their lithological and mechanical properties, and in the presence of any form of flexural-slip folding, tectonic or gravity-driven downslope movements, and associated with simple shear associated with either bed rotations between interacting faults or co-seismic shaking. Its identification might, however, be challenging due to the nature of the host rock sequence, the scale and resolution of both outcrop and seismic reflection data, and the absence of suitable slip markers.\n\n\n6.2\nImplications and suggestions for further research\nThe development of BPS within normal fault systems has important implications for the manner in which deformation is accommodated and partitioned in extensional settings (e.g., Watterson et al., 1998; Ferrill et al., 2007; Delogkos et al., 2018; Alsop et al., 2020). This review indicates that bed rotations arising from deformation associated with normal faulting, such as the folding and shearing of adjacent host rock sequences, are accommodated by mm- to decametre scale BPS. In addition to large-scale normal faulting, tectonic stretching in the upper brittle crust can also be accommodated by other structures including fracturing, folding and a broad range of smaller normal faults, all of which promote the development of BPS.\nConceptual models of BPS development suggest that thin-bedded sequences will contain more smaller displacement BPS, with larger displacement BPS localised adjacent to thicker more massive units and providing greater mechanical decoupling of cross-cutting faults. Although of subordinate nature compared to associated normal fault displacements, BPS are nevertheless capable of transecting normal fault systems and introducing complexities in both fault zone structure and host rock deformation. Contemporaneous movement on faults and BPS will generate mutually intersecting structures which over protracted periods of time will form more complex and yet kinematically coherent fracture systems. These will, in turn, provide more complex host rock volumes and fracture arrays for subsurface flow, (e.g., Couples et al., 1998; Dholakia et al., 1998; Medici et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018) circumstances which make greater demands on the characterisation of fault-BPS systems and the prediction of associated fluid flow, and potentially for a better estimation of the seismic hazard assessment. Published studies in contractional settings have demonstrated the potential of BPS planes to rupture during earthquakes, with active BPS planes accommodating a significant fraction of the total slip including coseismically produced geomorphic scarps (e.g., Philip and Meghraoui, 1983; Kelsey et al., 2008; Li et al., 2015; Otsubo et al., 2020).\nAlthough the effects of BPS in extensional settings can be significant, there are not many studies providing detailed constraints on their development, a situation we attribute to their relatively small scale and to the paucity or absence of appropriate high angle structures highlighting their displacements. We also suspect that their illusive nature partly arises from our failure to recognise, or perhaps acknowledge, their potential significance and the prevalence of models that do not include BPS. Many aspects of their geometry and kinematics have yet to be investigated and future studies, based on well-suited outcrop\/seismic reflection data and\/or analogue\/numerical modelling, should provide valuable knowledge on the role of structural configuration, mechanical stratigraphy, formation depth and prevailing fluid pressures on the initiation, development, and distribution of BPS within rock volumes. Only then can the implications of BPS for a variety of practical purposes be adequately defined.\n\n\n\n7\nConcluding remarks\n\n\n\n1.\nThis study compiles a global database of bed-parallel slip (BPS) associated with normal fault systems from 43 datasets derived from outcrop (n\u00a0=\u00a038), seismic reflection (n\u00a0=\u00a02), borehole (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and analogue sandbox (n\u00a0=\u00a01) studies.\n\n\n2.\nBPS appears to be a common feature within multi-layered host rock sequences in extensional settings.\n\n\n3.\nBPS within extensional basins is often found to be geometrically and\/or kinematically associated with normal faulting.\n\n\n4.\nThe four main configurations identified in the literature between BPS and normal faulting are: (a) normal fault abutting BPS, (b) BPS abutting normal fault, (c) BPS offsetting normal fault, and (d) normal fault offsetting BPS.\n\n\n5.\nThe development of BPS is kinematically associated with a broad range of fault-related deformation, including bed rotations, flexural-slip folding, and both tectonic and gravity-driven sliding.\n\n\n6.\nIn our compiled global dataset, BPS typically ranges from a few millimetres up to 4.5\u00a0m, and is of the same order for all different origins of BPS.\n\n\n7.\nFor flexural-slip folding and simple shear models the magnitude of BPS is expected to have a linear relationship with bed thickness for a constant bed rotation angle, and with bed rotation angle for a constant bed thickness.\n\n\n8.\nBPS is often accommodated by zones of multiple slip planes where slip is partitioned and transferred between the different slip planes.\n\n\n9.\nThe distribution of slip along the BPS planes is expected to differ depending on the origin of BPS.\n\n\n10.\nIdentification of BPS is often challenging due to its localised nature within bedded host rock sequences, the absence of suitable slip markers, and the scale and resolution of both outcrop and seismic reflection data.\n\n\n\n\n","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nInteractions between along- and down-slope processes are common across most continental margins. Down-slope, gravity-driven currents transport substantial amounts of sediment to the deep-sea, covering tens to hundreds of kilometres from a few seconds to several days (Middleton and Hampton, 1973; Covault et al., 2012). There is an entire spectrum of gravity-driven processes responsible for carrying sediments to the oceanic basins, from slides and slumps to debris flows and turbidity currents (Postma, 1986; Haughton et al., 2009). In contrast, along-slope bottom currents are usually associated with extensive accumulations of sediments, from the outer shelf to the abyssal plain, if a significant sediment input is available (Faug\u00e8res and Stow, 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014). The erosional or depositional capacity of a bottom current varies in time and along its track, as it can be influenced by more than one water mass (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2008, 2018) or by other oceanographic processes, such as internal waves, tides, or baroclinic currents (Stow et al., 2008; Shanmugam, 2008, 2017).\nConventionally, true interaction between bottom and gravity-driven currents (i.e., turbidity currents) was considered to require both processes active and with equal energy over a considerable period of time (Mulder et al., 2008). However, gravity-driven currents are usually surges of short duration (Clare et al., 2020), while bottom currents are considered persistent flows that can last for thousands of years (Zenk, 2008) and which have fluctuations at multiple timescales (Gardner et al., 2017; Thran et al., 2018; Miramontes et al., 2019). Therefore, the two processes have very different characteristics, yet frequent interactions between the two have built significant mixed turbidite-contourite systems (hereafter \u201cmixed systems\u201d) across numerous continental margins (Fig. 1\n). Key examples include the modern mixed systems along the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula (PMAP) (Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Amblas and Canals, 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2022a, 2022c), Weddell Sea (Michels et al., 2002; Huang and Jokat, 2016), South China Sea (Gong et al., 2013, 2016), the Paleogene deposits along the Brazilian (Viana et al., 2007; Viana, 2008; Mutti et al., 2014; Pandolpho et al., 2021), Mozambican (Chen et al., 2020; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Thi\u00e9blemont et al., 2020) and Tanzanian margins (Sansom, 2018; Fuhrmann et al., 2020), and the Cretaceous records offshore Argentina (Rodrigues et al., 2021), Uruguay (Badalini et al., 2016; Creaser et al., 2017), Nova Scotia (Rodrigues et al., 2022b) and Mauritania (Mourlot et al., 2018).\nDespite the abundant recognition of mixed systems, there is a clear lack of diagnostic criteria at the seismic and facies scales. For instance, several authors have proposed a distinction between mixed and hybrid systems, as hybrid systems are interpreted to have been built by frequent, synchronous interactions between turbidity and bottom currents (which would form bottom current reworked sands or transitional facies; Sansom, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020), whereas mixed systems may have changes between synchronous and asynchronous interactions (which would result in intercalations of bottom current reworked sands, pure turbidites, contourites or other deep-water deposits; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Gong et al., 2013, 2016; de Castro et al., 2020; Pandolpho et al., 2021). This interpretation assumes that the velocity and synchrony between the two processes is balanced across hybrid systems, which has yet to be measured across deep-water environments or assessed through rigorous lab experiments and numerical models.\nFurthermore, two contrasting interpretations have been proposed for mixed systems, with different bottom current directions relative to the downstream turbidity current (Gong et al., 2018; Sansom, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020). The examples across SE Greenland, South China Sea, Uruguay and Argentina revealed bottom currents flowing in the same direction as the system migration, generally down-current (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Gong et al., 2013, 2016, 2020; Creaser et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2021), whereas the mixed systems along the Antarctic Peninsula, Mozambique and Tanzania recorded bottom currents flowing opposite to the system migration, in an up-current direction (Camerlenghi et al., 1997; Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Sansom, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020, 2022; Thi\u00e9blemont et al., 2020; Miramontes et al., 2021). Recent flume tank experiments by Miramontes et al. (2020b) recreated the latter configuration, with simultaneous interactions between turbidity and bottom currents forming an up-current migrating system. An analysis of modern mixed systems, and comparison with ancient systems, is needed to establish the link between the different processes and products and to address the various conceptual models and their uncertainties.\n\nIn this work, we have compiled all currently known cases (to the best of the authors' knowledge; Figs. 1 and 2) and presented new undocumented examples (Supplementary Table S1) to compare their lateral migration, stratigraphic stacking patterns and seismic facies. In addition, morphometric relationships of three key examples (offshore Nova Scotia, Argentina and in the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula) are investigated in detail to document their spatial and temporal distribution and to compare their similarities and differences. These examples were chosen primarily due to their distinct locations (in the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere and polar region, respectively), depositional settings (upper slope vs. middle to lower slope vs. continental rise) and occurrence in time (as two of the mixed systems developed during the Cretaceous period whereas the third example developed between the Neogene and the present). Based on this compilation, a new classification system is proposed, along with clear diagnostic criteria, to address some of the previous inconsistencies and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of mixed systems.\nIn this work, we have compiled all currently known cases (to the best of the authors' knowledge; Figs. 1 and 2) and presented new undocumented examples (Supplementary Table S1) to compare their lateral migration, stratigraphic stacking patterns and seismic facies.

The external geometry of their main depositional and erosional morphological features (such as mounded drifts or submarine channels) is easy to recognize at a basin-scale or even at an inter-basin scale. In fact, many mixed systems have been identified across most continental margins since the 80s (Figs. 1 and 2; Stanley, 1987; Shanmugam et al., 1993; Viana et al., 1998; and references herein). For example, reworked deposits were first recognized 48\u00a0years ago (Bouma and Hollister, 1973) and the first models were proposed over 34\u00a0years ago (Fig. 2; Stanley, 1987, 1993). The only restriction to their detection was that previous authors considered there to be a dominance of turbidite processes in deep-sea sedimentation and often overlooked manifestations of other sedimentary or depositional processes (Rebesco et al., 2014). Nonetheless, research into mixed systems has increased significantly over the last years, thanks to the discovery of remarkable examples (such as the modern mixed systems in the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula and the ancient Cretaceous systems in the Danish North Sea; Fig. 2), new concepts and lab experiments (Creaser et al., 2017; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021; Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b). In particular, the discovery of over 2.32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 m3 of gas in the Paleogene mixed systems deposits offshore Mozambique revealed that these systems are characterized by extraordinary reservoir quality (Fonnesu, 2013; Fonnesu et al., 2020) and thus, renewed the interest and attention from academia and other research bodies.\nDespite the numerous sightings in the offshore, the identification of mixed features in outcrops remains extremely difficult, as it is often not possible to discern their external geometries at the outcrop scale. Their identification is also obscured by the overprint of other geologic processes, such as bioturbation, compaction, erosion, tectonics and metamorphism (de Castro et al., 2020; Kendell and Deptuck, 2020; Stow and Smillie, 2020). Therefore, the recognition of mixed turbidite-contourite deposits in outcrops needs to consider the context behind their formation, supported by a detailed paleogeographic and paleoceanographic framework. At present, there is only one well-known example in the onshore, the Upper Miocene to Pliocene deposits of Miradouro da Lua in the Kwanza Basin, Angola (Fig. 2; Cauxeiro et al., 2020). This study recognized intercalations of contourite and turbidite facies across several outcrops, characterized by clean, well-sorted sands, due to persistent bottom-current reworking (Cauxeiro et al., 2020). Other examples present small incursions and interactions between the two processes in ancient contourite- or turbidite-dominated settings (Stow et al., 2002; H\u00fcneke and Stow, 2008; H\u00fcneke et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nApart from a rigorous literature compilation, this study benefits from a wide range of seismic and bathymetric datasets, in order to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of mixed systems at different seismic resolutions. Three distinct systems are investigated, in detail, using various seismic datasets, from 2D broadband seismic reflection data to 3D seismic surveys and high-resolution sub-bottom profiles (Supplementary Table S2). These datasets cover, respectively, the Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Argentina, the Cretaceous to Eocene systems along the Nova Scotian margin, and the modern case along the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 3).\nApart from a rigorous literature compilation, this study benefits from a wide range of seismic and bathymetric datasets, in order to better understand the spatial and temporal variability of mixed systems at different seismic resolutions.

These datasets cover, respectively, the Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Argentina, the Cretaceous to Eocene systems along the Nova Scotian margin, and the modern case along the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 3).\n\n3.1\nBathymetry\n\nThe bathymetric data presented in this study consists of the global GEBCO 2019 dataset (GEBCO, 2019), which is a compilation of the available multibeam and single beam data collected around the world. The dataset was interpolated to 100\u00a0m cell size and projected to the Mercator spherical projection to minimize distortion (Fig. 3).\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic data\nEach seismic dataset has been acquired through different methods and processed through various software systems. Seismic acquisition and processing have been described, in depth, in previous studies (Larter et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b, 2022c). Key parameters for each seismic survey are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.\nEach seismic dataset has been acquired through different methods and processed through various software systems. Seismic acquisition and processing have been described, in depth, in previous studies (Larter et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b, 2022c). Key parameters for each seismic survey are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.\nFor the exemplary case on the Argentine margin (Fig. 4B), we used 2D broadband seismic reflection data, acquired by Spectrum (now TGS) in 2017\u20132018 (Rodrigues et al., 2021). The seismic data consists of a grid of 34 dip lines and 15 strike lines (each seismic line separated by 20\u00a0km, with a finer mesh of 10\u00a0km in the center). The seismic dataset has a resolution of ~9\u00a0m and a maximum frequency of 75\u00a0Hz. This seismic dataset covers a large portion of the Argentine margin, from the continental shelf at 100\u00a0m water depth to the continental rise at 6000\u00a0m water depth (Fig. 3; Rodrigues et al., 2021).\nFor the Nova Scotian mixed systems (Fig. 4A), we were able to use three 3D seismic surveys: the Torbrook, Thrumcap and Stonehouse surveys (Fig. 3). The Torbrook and Stonehouse 3D surveys were acquired by EnCana Corporation in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Thrumcap 3D survey was acquired by Shell Canada in 2001 (Campbell, 2011; Rodrigues et al., 2022b). The 3D seismic datasets have inline and crossline spacing of 12.5\u201337.5\u00a0m and vertical resolution of ~16\u00a0m, with 35\u201340\u00a0Hz frequency (Rodrigues et al., 2022b).\nFor the modern case along the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula (PMAP; Fig. 4C), we used Topographic Parametric Sonar (TOPAS) profiles acquired in 2015 by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) (Larter et al., 2021). The sub-bottom profiles have a frequency band of 1.5\u20135\u00a0kHz and a vertical resolution <1\u00a0m (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). The TOPAS sub-bottom profiles were used to characterize the upper sedimentary sequence of the modern mixed systems (down to \u2264150\u00a0ms two-way-travel time [TWT], corresponding to ~115\u00a0m below seafloor).\n\n\n3.3\nNomenclature\nThe description of the different morphological elements, identified along mixed systems, follows the criteria proposed by Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999), Rebesco et al. (2014), Fonnesu et al. (2020) and Rodrigues et al. (2021). Their studies define erosional and depositional features such as deep-sea channels, canyons, levees, gravitational deposits (turbidites and mass-transport deposits\u00a0=\u00a0MTDs) and submarine fans as being generated by down-slope gravity-driven currents, whereas features such as contouritic channels, moats, terraces and drifts were formed or subtantially reworked by the persistent action of along-slope bottom currents. Other elements, such as gullies, are considered mixed erosional-depositional features due to the ocurrence of both erosion and deposition during their formation. Mixed (turbidite-contourite) systems contain a wide range of features and deposits, derived from one of the two end members (contourite or turbidite) or their interactions, and subtantially shaped or reworked by the highly dynamic processes acting in the area (Mulder et al., 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022c). Such features are considered as part of a continuous spectrum of seismic facies between contourite-dominated features and turbidite-dominated features (Rodrigues et al., 2021). Taking this approach, we were able to distinguish and characterize distinct morphological features, according to their orientation, external morphology, lateral migration, stacking patterns and seismic facies (Rodrigues et al., 2021). A cautionary note on the hierarchy and scale of the channels identified in mixed systems should be mentioned here as they present significantly larger dimensions and wider morphologies than those recognized in turbidite systems (Macauley and Hubbard, 2013; Hubbard et al., 2014, 2020; Cullis et al., 2018).\n\n\n3.4\nMethodology\nThe geometries and dimensions of the Nova Scotian, Argentine and PMAP mixed systems were compiled and examined in detail, to study their trends and relations (Figs. 3 and 4). Seismic surface maps and high-resolution bathymetric grids were used to log the dimensions of the mounded drifts and submarine channels identified in each study case (Fig. 5\n).\nWe mapped a total of 32 mounded drifts and 35 channels across the three study cases (Fig. 3). Following the conventions of width, length, height, and depth used in other morphometric studies (Konsoer et al., 2013; Symons et al., 2016; Pettinga et al., 2018; Shumaker et al., 2018; Cullis et al., 2019; Englert et al., 2020), we measured channel and drift widths perpendicular to their trend, as the distance between the two channel margins (Fig. 5). Moreover, widths were taken at the start (s-w in Fig. 5), middle (m-w in Fig. 5) and final transects (e-w in Fig. 5), perpendicular to the drift and channel morphologies. Channel lengths were measured as the maximum downstream distance from the channel head to the channel mouth, parallel to the margins (Fig. 5). Drift lengths were measured as the maximum distance between the proximal and distal flanks (Fig. 5). Channel depths were measured as the maximum vertical distance between the channel margins and the thalweg. For asymmetric or wide unconfined channels, the largest depth was recorded. Depth measurements were extracted from perpendicular elevation profiles in water depth (m) and seismic profiles in depth (m) (Fig. 5). Drift heights were measured as the maximum vertical relief between the crest and the surrounding seafloor (Fig. 5). For drifts with more than one crest, the largest height was logged. Measurements across the 3D seismic cubes of Nova Scotia were also converted from two-way time (TWT ms) to depth (m), assuming the velocity model shown in Campbell et al. (2015), which was obtained by compiling checkshot- and vertical seismic profile (VSP)- derived time-depth pairs for all deep-water wells in the study area between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic interval. Outliers and anomalous values were filtered by removing measurements 170% greater than the maximum width or depth recorded. The ancient mixed systems offshore Argentina and Nova Scotia are buried below 1\u20131.5\u00a0km of Cenozoic sediments (Fig. 4A and B) and therefore, measurements of their channels and drifts should be considered relative estimations. We also calculated aspect ratios (width vs. depth, width vs. height and width vs. length), quartiles (boxplots), and cumulative distributions (frequencies) of each measurement.\n\n\n\n4\nComparison between mixed depositional systems\nMost authors have identified similar morphological elements across mixed depositional systems (Fig. 6\n). The main depositional features usually comprise down-slope elongated mounded drifts, channel-drifts, channel-levees or reworked submarine fans \/ lobes (Figs. 7 and 8\n\n; Faug\u00e8res et al., 2002; Creaser et al., 2017; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b), whereas the main erosional features correspond to submarine channels and\/or canyons (Figs. 6 and 9\n; Gong et al., 2013; Sansom, 2018; Fuhrmann et al., 2020; Mencaroni et al., 2021). Secondary depositional and erosional features may also occur in mixed systems, such as gravitational deposits, sediment waves or gullies (Figs. 9 and 10\n; Gong et al., 2012; Mutti et al., 2014; Maselli and Kneller, 2018; Counts et al., 2021). Their characteristics and dimensions are summarized below, along with key examples identified in the literature.\n\n4.1\nMain depositional features\n\n4.1.1\nDown-slope elongated mounded drifts\nDown-slope elongated mounded drifts are the most common depositional feature in mixed systems (Fig. 6). The mounded drifts are characterized by asymmetric geometries in general with a smooth, depositional flank and a steep, eroded flank (Fig. 4A). External shapes can be described as \u201calmond-shaped\u201d or \u201ccuspate\u201d due to a steep proximal flank and a distal flank that widens and flattens seaward (Fig. 7A). Their elongation is often perpendicular or oblique to the margin trend (Fig. 8), but some drifts may be deviated and oriented slightly parallel to the margin (Fig. 10D). These features are on average\u00a0~\u00a015\u201340\u00a0km wide, ~20\u2013200\u00a0km long and\u00a0~\u00a0200\u2013450\u00a0m high, but they may reach >150\u00a0km in width, <500\u00a0km in length and\u00a0>\u00a01.2\u00a0km in height (Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022a, 2022c). Drift crests are off centre \u2014generally located closer to the steeper flank\u2014 and have arcuate or crescentic shapes (Fig. 7A). The steep flanks are formed by local erosion, due to frequent turbidity flows or mass-transport processes surging through the channels and across their margins (Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002). Drift bodies comprise low amplitude, laterally continuous reflections (Fig. 6); occasionally, high amplitude reflections (HARs) extend laterally from the channels towards the mounded drifts, where they lose amplitude and thickness (Fig. 4B; Rodrigues et al., 2021). Some examples include the Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Uruguay (Fig. 6H; Badalini et al., 2016; Creaser et al., 2017), Argentina (Fig. 4B; Rodrigues et al., 2021) and Nova Scotia (Fig. 4A; Rodrigues et al., 2022b), as well as the modern analogues across the PMAP (Fig. 4C; Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Larter et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2022c) and US Atlantic margin (Mosher et al., 2017). Symmetric down-slope elongated mounded drifts have also been identified in the Argentinian and Nova Scotian mixed systems (Fig. 7A; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b), yet they occur more rarely across other mixed systems (Clausen, 1998a; Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002, 2007). Both flanks of symmetric mounded drifts are aggradational (Fig. 7A), with localized erosion near the submarine channels (Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b). Drift crests are usually centred along the top of the drifts or form two distinct drift crests with linear or slightly sinuous shapes (Fig. 7A). Such variations result from preferential sediment redistribution by bottom currents towards the centre of the drift or due to active turbidity currents eroding both flanks simultaneously (Rodrigues et al., 2022b).\n\n\n4.1.2\nChannel-drifts\nOther mixed systems feature channel-drifts, which grow within the channel and towards the channel thalweg (Fig. 9A). Channel-drifts often have asymmetric geometries, characterized by a steeper flank near the submarine channel, while the opposite flank flattens and extends outwards (Fig. 7B). Channel-drifts are considerably smaller than mounded drifts or levees, as they are on average\u00a0~\u00a01\u20135\u00a0km wide, ~2\u201315\u00a0km long and\u00a0~\u00a0100\u2013250\u00a0m high, and may reach ca. 5.5\u00a0km in width, 15\u00a0km in length and\u00a0<\u00a0350\u00a0m in height (Gong et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020). Channel-drift crests are located very close to the steep flanks (Fig. 7B) and do not reach great heights as the channel-drifts are severely limited in terms of space. Examples include the Miocene to Quaternary channel-drifts along the South China Sea (Figs. 6E and 10B; Chen et al., 2013, 2016; Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Palamenghi et al., 2015), the Paleogene deposits offshore Mozambique (Fig. 6F; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020, 2022) and the analogue model generated in flume-tank experiments (Miramontes et al., 2020b). These systems often show conflicting interpretations (Fonnesu et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020), as the lateral distribution of their features is restricted by channel morphology and could either follow an up- or down-current migration (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, channel bends might affect their migration, as variations in orientation, geometries or dimensions lead to changes in sediment overspill and spatial distribution (Chen et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.1.3\nChannel-levees \/ levees\nCertain mixed systems comprise channel-levees or levees, which resemble gull-wing, asymmetric turbidite levees (Fig. 6I; Kane and Hodgson, 2011). Such systems usually have a more developed channel-levee along the downstream channel margin (Fig. 9A), as the bottom current captures and redistributes sediment towards that margin (Miramontes et al., 2020b), whereas the opposite margin has a less developed channel-levee formed mainly by lateral overspill from the turbidity flows (Fig. 7C). Both levees present crests located closer to the steeper flanks, near the submarine channel (Fig. 9A). Levee crests are usually cuspate and sharp, similar to turbidite levees crests (Fig. 7C). In terms of dimensions, channel-levees are on average 2.5\u201310\u00a0km wide, 7.5\u201310\u00a0km long and 250\u2013500\u00a0m high, which may reach >10\u00a0km in width, >20\u00a0km in length and\u00a0>\u00a01\u00a0km in height (Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Several examples have also been identified offshore SE Greenland (Fig. 6B; Rasmussen et al., 2003), Nova Scotia (Fig. 10A; Normandeau et al., 2019), SE New Zealand (Carter and McCave, 2002; Bailey et al., 2021), Wilkes Land (Escutia et al., 2000, 2002), on the SE sector of the Weddell Sea (Fig. 6I; Michels et al., 2002; Huang and Jokat, 2016) and across the Columbia channel in the South Brazilian Basin (Faug\u00e8res et al., 2002).\n\n\n4.1.4\nReworked submarine fans \/ lobes\nMixed systems across unconfined continental slopes or abyssal plains typically develop submarine fans \/ lobes (Fig. 7D). The submarine fans correspond to low morphological reliefs with lens cross-sections and fan-shaped geometries (Fig. 9A). Submarine fans typically consist of an agglomeration of several lobes (and occasionally, the associated channel systems), forming huge, complex distal systems. Each submarine lobe is on average ca. 1\u201310\u00a0km wide, 1.5\u2013200\u00a0km long and\u00a0~\u00a0200\u00a0m high, however it may reach up to >10\u00a0km wide, >300\u00a0km long and\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0m high (Mulder et al., 2008). Their external morphology and dimensions are relatively similar to those of submarine fans \/ lobes found in turbidite settings (Jegou et al., 2008; Pr\u00e9lat et al., 2009, 2010; Cullis et al., 2018, 2019), however their unilateral stacking patterns is uniquely related to the effect of an along-slope bottom current. In fact, the sedimentary lobes are often diverted or reworked by the bottom current (Fig. 7D; Mutti et al., 2014), leading to lateral migration in accordance with the bottom current direction. This type of system has been found in the Gulf of Mexico (Shanmugam et al., 1993; Shanmugam, 2017), in the Paleogene record off SE Brazil (Fig. 6K; Viana et al., 2007; Viana, 2008; Mutti et al., 2014; Counts et al., 2021) and in the Pliocene deposits of the Gulf of Cadiz (March\u00e8s et al., 2007; Brackenridge et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n4.2\nMain erosional features\n\n4.2.1\nSubmarine channels\nWide, linear submarine channels have been identified across most mixed systems (Fig. 6). Mixed systems along the Antarctic margins and Nova Scotia are further characterized by a tributary network of channels and gullies across the continental slope (Figs. 8C and 10C; Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Rebesco et al., 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2022b, 2022c). However, other mixed systems rarely exhibit extensive tributary erosional features attached to the channels (Fig. 8A; Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Creaser et al., 2017; Sansom, 2018; Fuhrmann et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021). Instead, the submarine channels start as steep, V-shaped linear features that evolve down-slope into wide, U-shaped channels (Fig. 7A; Creaser et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2021). Submarine channels are on average 0.5\u201310\u00a0km wide, 25\u2013150\u00a0km long and ca. 50\u00a0m to 2\u00a0km deep, but some features may reach >15\u00a0km in width, >500\u00a0km in length and\u00a0<\u00a03\u00a0km in depth (Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b, 2022c). These features differ quite strongly from turbidite channels due to their overall larger dimensions (Macauley and Hubbard, 2013; Hubbard et al., 2014, 2020; Cullis et al., 2018) and also due to the fact that they broaden down-dip (Fig. 8C), whereas turbidite channels generally become smaller in cross-section (Pirmez and Imran, 2003; Covault et al., 2012). Furthermore, channels formed in mixed systems typically contour the reliefs created by the mounded drifts and become unconfined further seaward (Fig. 10C). Their lateral migration also follows the same direction as the overall system (Fig. 6).\nSome mixed systems have meandering channels with higher sinuosity (Fig. 7B; Chen et al., 2020). In these cases, bottom current influence is considered weak across the margin, which allows for the preservation of external channel geometries and bends (Fig. 10C). Coriolis forcing and\/or bottom current influence may still lead to unilateral migration, as shown for the Mozambican systems (Chen et al., 2020) and other deep-water systems (Peakall et al., 2012). Other mixed systems have an along-slope contourite channel (or moat), shaped by the main core of the bottom current (Fig. 6K). This type of erosional feature usually contours around the bathymetric reliefs of the continental slope, separating the main morphological features (e.g., down-slope elongated mounded drifts) from the slope (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Pandolpho et al., 2021). The along-slope channel exhibits a U-shaped external geometry, similar to the moat\/ contourite channel in a pure contourite depositional system (Fig. 6K). Currently known examples comprise the mixed systems along SE Greenland and Brazil (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Pandolpho et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.2.2\nSubmarine canyons\nFew mixed systems are associated with major submarine canyons (Serra et al., 2020; Mencaroni et al., 2021; Pandolpho et al., 2021). Canyons are characterized by steeper flanks and larger dimensions than the submarine channels (Fig. 6D). They usually assume V- to U-shaped depressions, perpendicular or oblique to the margin trend (Fig. 9A). On mixed systems, these features are on average 1.2\u201310\u00a0km wide, 15\u2013200\u00a0km long and\u00a0>\u00a0150\u00a0m to ~1.5\u00a0km deep (Rodrigues et al., 2020; Mencaroni et al., 2021), however larger dimensions have also been measured across the South China Sea and Weddell Sea (<20\u00a0km wide, >500\u00a0km long and\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0km deep; Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Palamenghi et al., 2015). Their morphologies may be complex, as they frequently comprise tributary channels across the canyon head, as well as gullies, furrows or scarps along their flanks (Fig. 9B; Rodrigues et al., 2020; Serra et al., 2020). Mixed systems are, from one side, harder to develop near submarine canyons, as these morphological features entrain significant amounts of sediment within their flanks and hinder lateral overspill from turbidity currents (Puig et al., 2014). However, canyon morphology can also deviate bottom currents from their pathway and generate vertical eddies (March\u00e8s et al., 2007, 2010) or promote interactions with nepheloid layers, enabling sediment pirating and redistribution by bottom currents (Puig et al., 2014; Serra et al., 2020; Conte et al., 2021; Mencaroni et al., 2021). Some examples have been identified across the Western and SW Iberian margins (Fig. 6D; March\u00e8s et al., 2007; de Stigter et al., 2011; Serra et al., 2020; Mencaroni et al., 2021) and offshore Brazil (Pandolpho et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n4.3\nSecondary features\nOther morphological elements occur at an intermediate (>10\u00a0m) and smaller (>1\u00a0m) scale (Fig. 9B). These features usually correspond to subordinate features as their formation depends on the development of the main morphological elements (e.g., mounded drifts and submarine channels). Their description can be classified as depositional, erosional, or mixed erosional-depositional (Fig. 9B), according to the main process behind their formation.\n\n4.3.1\nSecondary depositional features\n\n4.3.1.1\nGravitational deposits\nIn mixed turbidite-contourite systems, deposits exclusively formed by gravity-driven processes are frequently observed within channels or at the base of steep drift flanks (Fig. 4A). These features include MTDs (such as slides, slumps or debrites) or turbidite beds and present variable shapes and internal configurations (Fig. 9B). Gravitational deposits have incredibly variable shapes and dimensions, from ~5 to >30\u00a0km in width, ~5 to >140\u00a0km in length, and\u00a0~\u00a010\u2013500\u00a0m in thickness (Creaser et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022c). Each type of gravitational deposit is associated with a distinct type of gravity-driven process, from turbidity currents to fluidized flows or mass-transport processes (Haughton et al., 2009; Garc\u00eda et al., 2015). Furthermore, the continental slope and steep flanks of the mounded drifts are often associated with slope instabilities due to oversteepening, high sedimentation rates and frequent down-slope-flowing gravity currents (Fig. 4C; Teixeira et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). These effects promote slope failure and development of MTDs or turbidites with ambient water entrainment. The PMAP mixed systems present a wide variability of gravitational deposits (Fig. 4C), indicating the occurrence of different gravity-driven currents and changes between cohesive and non-cohesive behaviours (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Across the Argentine, Brazilian, Mauritanian and Uruguayan margins, the mixed systems are characterized by the collapse of steep drift flanks, which have accumulated as large MTDs or slumps across the submarine channels (Fig. 4C; Creaser et al., 2017; Mourlot et al., 2018; Pandolpho et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3.1.2\nChannel overbank deposits\nSmall, channel overbank deposits are typically formed within channels or complex channel systems, if a mixed system is characterized by an extensive channel network across the continental slope (Fig. 4C; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Channel overbank deposits exhibit asymmetric to symmetric bar shapes, parallel to the channel system trend (Fig. 9B). Across the PMAP mixed systems, these deposits reach ~2\u201325\u00a0km in width, 20\u201370\u00a0km in length and 100\u2013300\u00a0m in height (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Their surface may be scoured by small, sub-parallel gullies due to frequent gravity-driven currents cutting through the channel system (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Their internal configuration is characterized by continuous, high amplitude reflections intercalated by lenticular, chaotic to semi-transparent bodies (Fig. 9B). At present, overbank deposits have only been identified in the dendritic channel network across the PMAP mixed systems (Fig. 4C; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). However, other mixed systems have indicated that some mounded drifts resemble overbank features due to more frequent overspill from turbidity flows (Rasmussen et al., 2003).\n\n\n4.3.1.3\nSediment waves\nSediment waves are the most common secondary depositional feature identified across all mixed systems (Fig. 11\n). Sediment waves typically form extensive wave fields (covering areas >500\u20131000\u00a0km2) along the depositional flanks of the mounded drifts (Fonnesu et al., 2020; Pandolpho et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022a). Sediment waves are slightly oblique or parallel to the down-slope elongated mounded drifts, as they tend to be generated oblique or perpendicular to the main current direction (Fig. 11). They form asymmetric, wavy morphologies (Fig. 9B), usually <250\u00a0m wide, 3\u20137.5\u00a0km long and 15\u201355\u00a0m high (Miramontes et al., 2021; Pandolpho et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022a). Some examples along the Mozambican and Nova Scotian margins have reached widths below 500\u00a0m, lengths over 10\u00a0km and heights of ~150\u00a0m, with wavelengths around ca. 0.5\u201310\u00a0km (Normandeau et al., 2019; Miramontes et al., 2021).\nIn contourite depositional systems, the formation of sediment waves is often associated with moderate bottom currents at the exit of gateways, as shown in the Gulf of Cadiz contourite system (Habgood et al., 2003; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006b), or may result from internal oscillations of the pycnocline between two water masses (Fig. 11A), as suggested for the modern Argentine contourite system (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009, 2010). Sediment wave crests appear perpendicular or oblique to the along-slope bottom current (Fig. 11A; McCave, 2017), and their up-current migration is tied to bottom current sediment redistribution (Masson et al., 2002; Wynn and Stow, 2002).\nAcross turbidite depositional systems, sediment waves tend to develop within channels or their margins (Fig. 11B), usually perpendicularly to the down-slope channel trend and the turbidity flows (Normark et al., 2002; McCave, 2017). Their formation depends heavily on frequent turbidity currents, which, in addition to carrying the necessary sediment for their growth, interact with the seafloor through shear stress and bedload traction to allow up-slope progradation. Coarser sediments are deposited on the up-current, steep flanks of the waves, while fine-grained particles accumulate along the wide, smooth flanks (Normark et al., 2002; Wynn and Stow, 2002). Modern examples can be found along the Toyama deep-sea channel in the Japan Sea (Nakajima and Satoh, 2001) and in the turbidite systems associated with the Monterey, Hueneme and Amazon Fans (Normark et al., 2002).\nIn mixed systems, interaction between bottom currents and turbidity flows allows for sediment entrainment by bottom currents, which is probably redistributed towards the smooth, depositional flanks of the main morphological feature (i.e., along down-slope elongated mounded drifts) (Fig. 11C). The bottom current likely interacts with the seafloor along the depositional flank through sediment remobilization and reworking, forming sediment waves oblique or parallel to the mounded drifts (Fig. 11). Significant wave fields occur near the Taiwan Canyon in the South China Sea (Fig. 10B), where vigorous bottom currents may dominate over diluted turbidity currents, promoting vertically aggrading sediment waves (Gong et al., 2012). Some authors have argued that bottom currents alone could not have built these sediment waves, as the turbidity flows running through the Taiwan Canyon are incredibly active and may exert a stronger influence in their development (Li et al., 2021). It is also possible that oscillations along an upper pycnocline (between two water masses) could interact with the high reliefs of the mounded drifts, forming sediment waves along their top, as shown for the Argentine mixed systems (Fig. 4C; Rodrigues et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3.1.4\nOther bedforms\nSmall-scale bedforms, such as ripples and dunes, have been identified across some mixed systems in the South China Sea (Fig. 10B), Nova Scotia (Fig. 10A), Tanzanian and Brazilian margins (Gong et al., 2012; Mutti et al., 2014; Sansom, 2018; Counts et al., 2021). These features have variable shapes and configurations, usually asymmetric with a smooth, depositional flank and a short, steep flank (Fig. 9B). Dimensions may vary greatly, from <5\u00a0cm ripples to >5\u00a0m longitudinal ripples, which reach ~1\u201320\u00a0cm in height and\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0cm to ~1\u00a0m in wavelength (Mart\u00edn-Chivelet et al., 2008). Bedforms may be formed across different morphological features, along the top or flanks of the mounded drifts and towards channel margins (Fig. 10; Mulder et al., 2008; Wynn and Masson, 2008). Their orientation and elongation are related to the main current direction and its interactions with the seafloor (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2018).\n\n\n\n4.3.2\nSecondary erosional features\n\n4.3.2.1\nErosional surfaces\nMixed systems are often characterized by a basal erosional surface and by minor internal erosional surfaces within its sedimentary record (Fig. 9B). The erosional surface corresponds to a high amplitude, laterally continuous reflection, marked by truncated reflections below and by onlapping reflections above (Fig. 4A). Erosional surfaces are on average 25\u201330\u00a0km wide and 50\u2013150\u00a0km long, however they may reach >50\u00a0km in width and\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0km in length due to widespread erosion (Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021). The ancient mixed systems offshore Argentina, Uruguay and Nova Scotia have an erosional discontinuity at 125\u00a0Ma, which is laterally continuous at a regional scale (Fig. 4). The basal discontinuity is associated with the onset of the mixed systems and therefore marks the beginning of interactions between along-slope bottom currents and down-slope turbidity flows (Creaser et al., 2017; Sansom, 2018; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b). Other ancient mixed systems present a basal erosional surface, e.g., the Paleogene systems offshore Tanzania and Mozambique (Fig. 6F and J; Sansom, 2017, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020; Thi\u00e9blemont et al., 2020). Since mixed systems tend to be established in the wake of turbidite systems, the erosional surface usually characterizes the start of an along-slope current circulation and its reshaping of the previous turbidite morphologies (Rodrigues et al., 2022b).\nInternal erosional surfaces generally comprise minor abraded surfaces within mixed systems (Fig. 9B). Such surfaces are marked by a high or low amplitude reflection, with localized toplap or truncated reflections. All mixed systems have minor erosional surfaces within the mounded drifts or channel-levees (Figs. 4 and 6). These surfaces are caused by down-slope gravitational processes sweeping over the flanks of the mounded drifts or due to slope failure across the steep flanks (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Enhancements of the bottom current may also be associated with erosional surfaces, as the current can partially erode the top of the mounded drifts and form wide, erosional surfaces (Rodrigues et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3.2.2\nScarps\nSeveral scarps appear prominently along the proximal parts of mounded drifts and across their lateral flanks in mixed systems (Larter et al., 2019). The scarps exhibit concave, arcuate shapes, oblique or parallel to the mounded drifts (Fig. 9B) and may form step-like stacking patterns (Rodrigues et al., 2020). Across the PMAP mixed systems, arcuate scarps have been identified along depositional drift flanks, with ca. 4\u201345\u00a0km in width and 50\u2013100\u00a0m in height (Rebesco et al., 2007; Larter et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). The sediments below and to the side of them present truncated, high amplitude reflections at the headwall and chaotic, irregular to semi-transparent MTDs at the base, associated with gravitational mass movements, flank collapses or tectonic events (Fig. 4C; Liu et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Significant examples include the modern analogue along the PMAP (Fig. 6L; Larter et al., 2019) and South China Sea (Fig. 6E; Liu et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.3.2.3\nScours and furrows\nScours and furrows correspond to minor erosional elements, which may be formed along the seafloor or within the channel framework (Fig. 9B). Scours may comprise comet- or irregularly-shaped marks (such as chevron and spoon-shaped scours; Pohl et al., 2019) of variable dimensions and orientations, usually around >1\u20132.5\u00a0km long, >0.5\u20133\u00a0km wide and\u00a0>\u00a01\u201350\u00a0m deep (Macdonald et al., 2011; Pohl et al., 2019). Furrows typically comprise parallel, longitudinal marks that are regularly spaced (in the range of ~10\u00a0m\u20131\u00a0km) and reach ca. >10\u00a0m\u20132\u00a0km long, ~1\u00a0m\u20131.5\u00a0km wide and\u00a0~\u00a01\u2013100\u00a0m deep (Viekman et al., 1992; Stow et al., 2009). Both of these features are usually narrower and less incised than submarine channels (Fig. 9; Rebesco et al., 2014) and may be elongated according to the turbidity or bottom current direction (as they result from the effect of these processes on the seafloor; Stow et al., 2013). In some cases, sub-circular to oval scours are attributed to vertical spouts of water and dynamic bottom current flows (Stoker et al., 2003), or from their interaction with seafloor irregularities (Lobo et al., 2011). Some examples have been identified offshore Antarctica in the Weddell Sea (Maldonado et al., 2005), as well as in the Scan Basin (Lobo et al., 2011) and PMAP (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006a, 2017).\n\n\n\n4.3.3\nSecondary mixed depositional-erosional features\n\n4.3.3.1\nTerraces.\nContourite terraces have been identified mostly along the mounded drifts of the Argentinian mixed systems (Fig. 4B; Rodrigues et al., 2021). They are characterized as wide, approximately flat non-depositional features (Fig. 9B), on average 5\u201325\u00a0km wide and 50\u201380\u00a0km long (Rodrigues et al., 2021). The terraces occur along the top of the mounded drifts, suggesting that their formation may be related to a more tabular, unconfined flow or a pycnocline between two water masses (Fig. 11A; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009, 2010; Rebesco et al., 2014). This type of feature may be difficult to identify in other mixed systems, as they tend to migrate laterally and erode the terraces. Yet, contourite terraces and abraded surfaces can be recorded within the depositional record if sufficient sediment covers the surface and preserves its key criteria: a high amplitude, flat, horizontal reflection along the top, and toplap terminations from the underlying sediments (Fig. 9; Thi\u00e9blemont et al., 2019, 2020). This surface may also appear \u201cwavy\u201d in the seismic data owning to the presence of sediment waves along its top (Fig. 4B).\n\n\n4.3.3.2\nGullies\nSeveral gullies have been observed across modern mixed systems, in the NW Iberian margin (Llave et al., 2018), PMAP (Fig. 4C; Amblas et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017) and Weddell Sea (Gales et al., 2013, 2021; Huang and Jokat, 2016), as well as in the Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Nova Scotia (Rodrigues et al., 2022c). The gullies correspond to small, V-shaped, linear features (Fig. 9B), frequently formed across the upper part of the channel network, along the upper continental slope (Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Gales et al., 2013). Gullies can also be formed along the steep flanks of mounded drifts, where they assume an oblique or perpendicular trend to the mounded drifts (Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Rebesco et al., 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). These features are on average\u00a0<\u00a0200\u00a0m to 1\u00a0km wide, <0.9\u20133\u00a0km long and\u00a0<\u00a0100\u2013500\u00a0m deep (Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Gales et al., 2013). Gullies are often associated with steep slopes or flanks due to steepness, high sedimentation rates and frequent gravitational processes (Noormets et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n\n4.4\nMorphometrics and scaling relationships\nTaking into consideration the variety of features that may occur across mixed systems (Fig. 9), we have measured the dimensions, deviations and cumulative distributions of three distinct case studies (offshore Argentina, Nova Scotia and PMAP; Figs. 3 and 4), to better understand the similarities and differences that may exist between their main morphological features (e.g., submarine channels and mounded drifts).\n\n4.4.1\nDimensions\nThe Argentine mixed system is characterized by average dimensions, with ~10\u201330\u00a0km wide and\u00a0>\u00a0125\u00a0km long mounded drifts and\u00a0~\u00a08\u201310\u00a0km wide and\u00a0>\u00a0120\u2013150\u00a0km long submarine channels (Fig. 12 and Supplementary Fig. S1). On logarithmic scale, aspect ratios follow linear trends, suggesting a link between width and length and also between width and depth (Fig. 12). In general, dimensions are smaller for the channel heads, located proximal to the slope, and larger across channel mouths in distal regions (Supplementary Fig. S1 B).\nThe Argentine mixed system is characterized by average dimensions, with ~10\u201330\u00a0km wide and\u00a0>\u00a0125\u00a0km long mounded drifts and\u00a0~\u00a08\u201310\u00a0km wide and\u00a0>\u00a0120\u2013150\u00a0km long submarine channels (Fig. 12 and Supplementary Fig. S1). On logarithmic scale, aspect ratios follow linear trends, suggesting a link between width and length and also between width and depth (Fig. 12). In general, dimensions are smaller for the channel heads, located proximal to the slope, and larger across channel mouths in distal regions (Supplementary Fig. S1 B).\nThe Cretaceous to Eocene mixed system in Nova Scotia presents the smallest aspect ratios (Fig. 12); this might be an underestimation, however, as the 3D seismic cubes do not cover the entire length of the channels and the distal flanks of the mounded drifts (Fig. 8). All aspect ratios appear to follow linear trends (Fig. 13), though the mounded drifts are generally smaller than others (Supplementary Fig. S1 A).\nThe Cretaceous to Eocene mixed system in Nova Scotia presents the smallest aspect ratios (Fig. 12); this might be an underestimation, however, as the 3D seismic cubes do not cover the entire length of the channels and the distal flanks of the mounded drifts (Fig. 8). All aspect ratios appear to follow linear trends (Fig. 13), though the mounded drifts are generally smaller than others (Supplementary Fig. S1 A).\n\n\nIn terms of dimensions, the PMAP mixed systems give the largest aspect ratios across all measurements (Fig. 12). Both the mounded drifts and the submarine channels follow a linear trend for width vs. length, similar to the other mixed systems (Fig. 12A and C). Aspect ratios of both width vs. depth and width vs. height suggest variable widths, despite similar depths \/ heights throughout the margin (Fig. 12B and D).\nIn turbidites and fluvial systems, there is often a link between the sizes of their morphological features and the nature of the processes involved in their formation (Konsoer et al., 2013; Shumaker et al., 2018; Cullis et al., 2019). This link corresponds to a power-law between the channel discharge and the running length of turbidity flows (Konsoer et al., 2013; Pettinga et al., 2018; Shumaker et al., 2018; Cullis et al., 2019). Mixed systems are shaped by both turbidity and bottom currents and as such, may present such a link or connection to these two processes. Considering our results (Fig. 12), we can infer that recurrent pirating of fine-grained particles by bottom currents will lead to larger dimensions and downward expansion of the morphological features in mixed systems, as the turbidity current gradually loses sediment to the along-slope current and the elongated mounded drifts grow progressively in intra-channel areas. This process results in increasing channel and drift dimensions down-slope, with low to moderate aspect ratios (10:1 and 100:1), which also maintain the scaling relationships between width and length, and between width and height further down-slope (Fig. 12).\nThe aspect ratios for the PMAP drifts and channels (Fig. 12) are considered very high (1000:1) and less common in deep-water systems, as they suggest that there is a diminished capacity to confine the turbidity currents within the channels. At the opposite end of the scale, the very low aspect ratios (1:1) measured across the Nova Scotian drifts and channels are less common (Fig. 12), as they indicate that these features have very similar dimensions from start (s-w) to end (e-w) (Fig. 5B). This effect suggests a constant balance between deposition and erosion, from proximal to distal areas. Such a balance is difficult to maintain in depositional systems, as the mounded drifts tend to be thicker and have a higher relief in the centre, while the channels tend to widen towards the channel mouths (Figs. 7 and 8). This effect might be associated with the morphologies of the Nova Scotian mounded drifts (Fig. 4A), which are more linear and symmetric than in other systems, despite still having an eroded flank and a depositional flank (Fig. 6A).\nAspect ratios also vary due to the effect of other controlling factors, such as slope gradient and margin location. The PMAP mixed systems have more space to develop distally and therefore present higher aspect ratios (Fig. 12) and less scale-dependency. As for the Nova Scotian mixed systems, the mounded drifts and channels across the NE slope are limited by salt diapirs (Fig. 8A) and thus would not be expected to keep dimensions similar to the other features measured in this study.\n\n\n4.4.2\nDeviations\nIn the boxplots, the lower quartiles represent the dimensions of the mounded drifts and channels measured at the start (defined as \u201cs-w\u201d in Fig. 5B), which are usually smaller and less variable near the upper continental slope (Fig. 13); while the upper quartiles represent the dimensions that were taken more distally (defined as \u201ce-w\u201d in Fig. 5B) and reflect higher dispersion (Fig. 13), as the channels are generally less confined towards the abyssal plains and the mounded drifts have flatter reliefs (Fig. 8).\nIn terms of variability, the mounded drifts across the PMAP reach the maximum range across all dimensions, while the other depositional systems exhibit similar measurements (Fig. 13A-C). The measurements across the Nova Scotian stand out due to their low values but also due to their low variability (Fig. 13A-C). As for the submarine channels, the PMAP channels exhibit the highest values and variability in terms of length and depth, but the Argentine system is characterized by the largest variability in terms of width (Fig. 13D-F).\nThe dimensions of the PMAP may be linked to the running length of the turbidity currents, as they have a more complex network of channels and overbank deposits near the slope and less topographic relief seaward (Fig. 8C; Rodrigues et al., 2022b). Turbidity currents are more frequent across proximal areas and within the channel complex systems, being generated by recurring ice grounding along the shelf edge and across paleo-ice stream pathways during glacial stages (Rebesco et al., 2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Amblas et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017). Therefore, these currents supply more sediment to the proximal drift flanks, while the distal flanks are mainly shaped by the along-slope bottom current or by turbidity currents with longer recurrence times.\nHeights and depths measured across the mounded drifts and submarine channels report a more constant range (Fig. 13C and F), despite having very low values across the Nova Scotian mixed systems. The Argentine mixed systems are often characterized by channels wider than the average range, despite exhibiting mounded drifts with average dimensions (Fig. 13E). For these cases, a down-slope profile along the channel thalweg and along the drift crest might help identify the control factors responsible for their variability.\n\n\n4.4.3\nCumulative distributions\nCumulative distributions can be used to reveal the probability of a morphological feature having lower or higher dimensions than those that were measured. Based on our results, the cumulative distribution of each measurement (taken across the mounded drifts and channels) suggests similar dimensions, with low frequency and linear fits (Fig. 14\n). However, a few exceptions were observed. The PMAP drifts and channels follow a gaussian distribution with larger dimensions than the average for all measurements (Fig. 14), except for the channel width, which have average dimensions (Fig. 14E). In contrast, the Argentine drifts are systematically smaller in length and height (Fig. 14A-C) despite being associated with the largest channels (Fig. 14D-F). The drifts and channels across the Nova Scotian margin have very small dimensions, often below average (Fig. 14).\nThe cumulative distributions for the different measurements (e.g., width, length, height, and depth) indicate that each system is characterized by its own range (Fig. 14). However, it also suggests that there is a link between their dimensions. If we consider the previous observations made for the aspect ratios (Fig. 12) and the variability observed in the boxplots (Fig. 13), a rapid or slow loss of depth or width may reflect erosion and\/or deposition (Shumaker et al., 2018). When comparing the dimensions of the channels and mounded drifts (Supplementary Fig. S1), discrepancies in terms of length, width, height, or depth reflect changes in slope confinement and\/or accommodation space. The Nova Scotian margin is limited by salt diapirs towards west and therefore has limited drift and channel growth (Fig. 8A; Kendell and Deptuck, 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022b). In contrast, the PMAP mixed systems developed in an unconfined margin and therefore, its morphological features present higher variability and dimensions (Figs. 12-14).\nThe cumulative distributions for the different measurements (e.g., width, length, height, and depth) indicate that each system is characterized by its own range (Fig. 14).

In contrast, the PMAP mixed systems developed in an unconfined margin and therefore, its morphological features present higher variability and dimensions (Figs. 12-14).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThis compilation has revealed that mixed systems are characterized by highly variable stacking patterns (Fig. 6) and distinct morphological features (Fig. 9), developed across diverse depositional settings (i.e., from the upper continental slope down to the abyssal plain). As such, we can use this variability to propose a new classification system for mixed systems and to address and evaluate the main control factors involved in their formation.\n\n5.1\nLateral system migration\nMost mixed systems are characterized by a clear unilateral migration, usually up- or down-current (Fig. 15\n). The mixed systems built offshore Mozambique, Tanzania and PMAP are marked by an up-current migration (Fig. 15A; Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Sansom, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Thi\u00e9blemont et al., 2020; Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022b), whereas the mixed systems along the South China Sea, SE Greenland, Uruguay and Argentina are characterized by a down-current migration (Fig. 15B; Rasmussen et al., 2003; Gong et al., 2016; Creaser et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2021). For the modern systems across SE Greenland, South China Sea and PMAP (Fig. 6B, E and L), several current measurements were taken at the seafloor and up to several meters above them (Dickson and Brown, 1994; Camerlenghi et al., 1997; Stramma and England, 1999; Kuijpers et al., 2002; Giorgetti et al., 2003; Merciera et al., 2003; Rasmussen et al., 2003; Hillenbrand et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2017), which confirmed that the bottom current flowed in the same or in an opposite direction to the system migration (Fig. 15). As such, mixed systems may migrate with or against the bottom current direction (Fig. 15). There may be several factors responsible for this variation in system migration, such as the velocity and persistency of bottom currents versus the velocity and frequency of turbidity flows. In contourite systems, strong and persistent bottom currents (>25\u201330 cms\u22121) are capable of entraining fine- and coarse-grained sediments and building down-current migrating contourite systems (Stow et al., 2002; Rodrigues et al., 2020). Therefore, we would expect that a mixed system built under similar conditions (with a strong bottom current) would migrate preferentially down-current (Fig. 15A). For cases of mixed systems built under weak to moderate bottom currents (such as the modern examples across the Weddell Sea and Mozambique, with 6.8 and 5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 cms\u22121 average current speeds; Michels et al., 2002; Miramontes et al., 2021), an up-current lateral migration appears to be more dominant, suggesting that turbidity flows play a more significant role in their lateral migration. In turbidite systems, turbidity flows may reach velocities >1\u20132\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 (Azpiroz-Zabala et al., 2017a, 2017b; Heerema et al., 2020) whilst carrying considerable volumes of sediment (Meiburg and Kneller, 2010; Shanmugam, 2016). Partial or complete overspill from turbidity flows leads to the formation of asymmetric levees, which migrate according to channel infill and\/or erosion (Wells and Cossu, 2013; Hansen et al., 2015; de Leeuw et al., 2018). Frequent turbidity flows may therefore aid or affect lateral system migration, as they may deliver considerable amounts of sediment towards the down-current levees and erode the up-current levees (Fig. 15B).\nIt has also been observed that some mixed systems are severely constrained in their lateral migration by the surrounding morphologies and seafloor irregularities (Rodrigues et al., 2022b). The mixed systems developed along the South China Sea and Mozambican margin (Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Chen et al., 2020; Fonnesu et al., 2020) are characterized by the growth of channel-drifts (Fig. 10B), which tend to migrate towards or within wide submarine channels (Fig. 6E and F). Channel-drifts create high bathymetric reliefs, which force the channel to migrate laterally and erode the next channel-drift (Fig. 15). As such, lateral system migration may be severely limited by the accommodation space and the depositional setting. Other studies have also shown that the dimensions of the mounded drifts and\/or submarine channels may considerably affect sediment deposition and build-up, as they may create significant barriers or depressions across the seafloor (Fig. 4), which will force the along-slope current to contour these features and deposit its sediments seaward or along the submarine channels (Chen et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022b). Most mixed systems rarely exhibit up-slope migration, as they are constrained by steep slope morphologies and\/or structural highs (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.2\nInteractions between along- and down-slope processes\nThe interactions between along-slope bottom currents and down-slope turbidity flows can effectively build a myriad of features and deposits across the seismic record. Their geometries and stacking patterns indicate a significant variability across space and time, associated with different types of interactions and the timing between the two processes (Fig. 16\n). There are three distinct types of interactions that have been observed across modern and ancient sedimentary records: synchronous, asynchronous and passive interactions.\n\n5.2.1\nSynchronous (or coeval) interactions\nSynchronous or coeval interactions are the most common type of interaction preserved across all mixed systems, contrary to the interpretation proposed by Mulder et al. (2008). Transitional facies between contourites and turbidites \u2014as well as the presence of reworked turbidite deposits (Lucchi et al., 2002; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; de Castro et al., 2020, 2021) and cyclic seismic facies (Fig. 4)\u2014 indicate frequent, synchronous interactions between turbidity and bottom currents (Fig. 16A). Regular along-slope and down-slope flow interaction would be required, as the turbidity currents comprise the main sediment source and the role of the bottom current in redistributing the fine-grained particles is essential to build the down-slope elongated mounded drifts and force the lateral migration of the system (Fig. 15). Furthermore, most mounded drifts or levees are characterized by HARs extending from the channels into the mounded drifts (Fig. 6), which lose amplitude and thickness. Synchronous interactions would therefore be required to deviate the turbidity plume off-axis (Fig. 16A) and form these internal configurations (Fig. 4B). Recent flume tank experiments by Miramontes et al. (2020b) have shown significant deviations of the turbidity current under the effect of a moderate (to vigorous) along-slope current (which corresponds to 10\u201320% of the velocity of the turbidity current).\n\n\n5.2.2\nAsynchronous (or phased) interactions\nAsynchronous (or phased) interactions between along-slope bottom currents and down-slope turbidity flows may form alternations of turbidites and contourites in the sedimentary and seismic records (Fig. 16B). At a high-resolution scale, the PMAP mixed systems are prone to such facies along the terminations of the drift flanks and near channel margins (Fig. 4). The turbidity current is responsible for depositing coarse-grained deposits along the channel thalweg and margins, while the subsequent bottom current winnows the fine-grained particles to form muddy intercalations of fine-grained contourites and leaves a coarse lag at the base (Fig. 16B). Asynchronous interactions can be associated with the high-frequency alternations of Mulder et al. (2008), as they represent intercalations of coarse-grained turbidite deposits and fine-grained contourites (Fig. 16B). Fluctuating hydrodynamic regimes would be required, given that persistent bottom current action along a turbidite system would strip the fine-grained particles and possibly disturb the coarser turbidite beds, forming reworked turbidite deposits (de Castro et al., 2020, 2021). Asynchronous interactions may also occur when the bottom current reshapes the sediments originally deposited by turbidity currents. For instance, in the Mozambique Channel, bottom currents have eroded the flanks of the Zambezi Valley and some furrows have also been observed on a channel-levee system in the Europa Island (Counts et al., 2018; Miramontes et al., 2021). Other examples of asynchronous interactions have been identified in mixed systems of the South China Sea (Fig. 6E; Gong et al., 2013, 2016) and across the Paleocene-Eocene record of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil (Fig. 6K; Moraes et al., 2007; Pandolpho et al., 2021).\n\n\n5.2.3\nPassive interactions\nPassive interactions are rare in mixed systems, as they require bottom currents to interact with turbidite deposits (or vice-versa) without crossing paths with the turbidity flows (Fig. 16C). Both the bottom and the turbidity currents would have to coexist near each other and interact passively (Fig. 16C), which is more common in pure contourite and turbidite systems. This type of interaction affects pure turbidite deposits that were preserved in the sedimentary record or at the seafloor (Fig. 16C), due to the passage of an along-slope bottom current during a rare and episodic event (Fig. 16C). Such interaction can be associated with the low-frequency alternations of Mulder et al. (2008). At present, there are only two currently known cases, the Quaternary fluvial-deltaic deposits in the Northern North Sea (Batchelor et al., 2021) and the Maury channel system offshore Iceland (Elliot and Parson, 2008). In both cases, an extensive contourite system grew near a glacially-fed turbidite channel system, causing deviation or ponding of turbidite deposits near the contourite system due to the influence of an along-slope current.\nOther passive interactions have been preserved in modern submarine channels or canyons cutting through contourite systems, such as the Portim\u00e3o Canyon in the Gulf of Cadiz (March\u00e8s et al., 2007), the S\u00e3o Vicente Canyon south of the Sines contourite system (Serra et al., 2020) or the deviated channel contouring the Chesapeake Drift (Fig. 10; Deptuck and Sylvester, 2017). In such cases, the along-slope bottom current interacts with gravitational deposits accumulated along the canyon's flanks and forms a mixed feature within a dominant turbidite system (Fig. 16C).\nAnother possibility for passive interactions is the occurrence of slope instabilities in pure contourite systems (Teixeira et al., 2019; Rodrigues et al., 2020). Steep slope scarps often limit contourite depositional systems (Liu et al., 2021) and, therefore, allow reworking of gravitational processes driven by slope failure (Maselli and Kneller, 2018). Oversteepness and high sedimentation rates may therefore trigger slope instabilities near steep scarps, generating gravitational deposits that eventually accumulate in the contourite drifts and are subsequently reworked by the along-slope current (Maselli and Kneller, 2018; Teixeira et al., 2019). As such, these interactions form mixed deposits within a dominant contourite setting.\n\n\n\n5.3\nNew classification system for mixed depositional systems\nIn light of this compilation and our observations, we propose a new classification system for mixed depositional systems. Based on the orientation, asymmetry, lateral migration, spatial distribution, and vertical variability of the different depositional and erosional features, three major types of mixed systems can be distinguished (Fig. 17\n): contourite-dominated, synchronous and turbidite-dominated systems. These systems were further subdivided in terms of their location, as proximal or distal settings (Fig. 17).\n\n5.3.1\nContourite-dominated mixed systems\nContourite-dominated mixed systems develop along the upper or middle to lower slope with large, along-slope elongated mounded or plastered drifts (Fig. 17A). Their submarine channels tend to cut through or contour around the mounded drifts as V-shaped features with low sinuosity, which evolve down-slope towards U-shaped channels (Fig. 17A). Such channels have been identified along the modern channel sector in the Gulf of Cadiz contourite system (Mulder et al., 2006; de Castro et al., 2020). Down-slope turbidity currents erode the channel thalweg and carry fine-grained particles in suspension, which are redistributed along the slope by the flowing bottom current (Fig. 17A). The channels may terminate at an along-slope contourite moat (as seen for the mixed systems built offshore SE Greenland; Rasmussen et al., 2003). The along-slope bottom current is therefore responsible for pirating the fine-grained particles carried down-slope by the turbidity flows and also for reworking any ponded turbidites accumulated along the contourite moat (Fig. 17A). Several ponded turbidites and reworked turbidite deposits have been identified within the Pliocene record of the Gulf of Cadiz (Roque et al., 2012; Brackenridge et al., 2013). The bottom current can moreover form secondary features \u2014such as contourite terraces and sediment waves\u2014 along the top of the mounded or plastered drifts if it interacts with the seafloor (Fig. 17A). Such is the case for the modern systems built across SE Argentina (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009, 2010;) and SW Portugal (Rodrigues et al., 2020; Mencaroni et al., 2021), where significant sediment waves and contourite terraces spread across the continental slope (Fig. 6D).\nDistally, contourite-dominated mixed systems formed along the continental rise and abyssal plains are characterized by sheeted drifts or along-slope elongated, mounded drifts intercalated by submarine channels (Fig. 17A). The channels may become unconfined after the slope break and form small fan lobes within the mounded or sheeted drifts. The fan lobes could also be deposited further seaward, if the turbidity currents run through and bypass the large contourite morphologies (Fig. 17A). Such cases have been observed along the NE Rockall Trough (Howe et al., 2002, 2006) and middle US Atlantic margin (Tucholke and Mountain, 1986; McMaster et al., 1989; Locker and Laine, 1992; Tucholke, 2002), where several submarine channels contour along-slope elongated, mounded drifts before depositing their sediments further seaward (Fig. 10D). The along-slope bottom current will usually interact with the turbidity flows and strip the fine-grained sediments carried in suspension or winnow the turbidite deposits accumulated along or near the submarine channels (Fig. 17A).\n\n\n5.3.2\nSynchronous systems\nSynchronous systems are usually formed by frequent, coeval interactions between turbidity flows and bottom currents (Fig. 17B). Such systems are described here as \u2018synchronous\u2019 due to the formation of mixed features and\/or facies under synchronous interactions, while mixed systems may contain intercalations of pure contourite and\/or turbidite deposits formed during asynchronous or passive interactions at the seismic and outcrop scale. Synchronous systems are characterized by asymmetric to symmetric down-slope elongated mounded drifts and channels along the middle to lower continental slope (Fig. 17B), as seen for the Late Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Mauritania, Argentina and Uruguay (Fig. 6G and H; Creaser et al., 2017; Mourlot et al., 2018; Rodrigues et al., 2021). The elongated drifts exhibit a smooth, depositional flank and a steep, rough (and sometimes eroded) flank (Fig. 4). The submarine channels are usually linear V- to U-shaped features with low sinuosity, which widen and become unconfined seaward of the mounded morphologies (Fig. 17B). Both the mounded drifts and the channels migrate unilaterally, down- or up-current, in respect to the bottom current direction (Fig. 15). The along-slope bottom current pirates the fine-grained particles carried by turbidity flows and redistributes them along the depositional flanks. Secondary features, such as sediment waves, are mostly formed along the depositional flanks of the elongated mounded drifts, owning to the interaction of the bottom current with the seafloor (Fig. 11).\nDistal synchronous systems feature extensive, down-slope elongated mounded drifts and wide submarine channels (Fig. 17B). The geometry of the mounded drifts resembles asymmetric shapes with a smooth depositional flank and a steep, rough flank (Fig. 17B). The mounded drifts tend to have thicker, proximal flanks near the continental slope, which thin outwards towards the abyssal plains. Their down-slope elongation might deviate distally or form a crescentic shape due to along-slope sediment redistribution by bottom currents (Figs. 7 and 8). Significant examples of convex-shaped mounded drifts have been identified along the PMAP (Fig. 8C; Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017) and SE Greenland (Fig. 6B; Rasmussen et al., 2003). Across these areas, the submarine channels are fed by a complex network of tributary channels along the lower continental slope and rise, which are associated with frequent turbidity currents and mass transport processes. Furthermore, coeval or alternating interactions between bottom currents and turbidity currents leads to the unilateral migration of the system (Fig. 17B). Submarine fan lobes might not develop after the mounded drifts if the coarser deposits are redistributed from the channel bed towards the lateral flanks of the mounded drifts by bottom currents (Fig. 17B). This effect might form alternations or \u201cinterfingering\u201d of coarser turbidites or reworked deposits and fine-grained contourites (Rodrigues et al., 2022a).\n\n\n5.3.3\nTurbidite-dominated mixed systems\nTurbidite-dominated mixed systems can occur along proximal settings (e.g., in the upper, middle and\/or lower slope), comprising morphological features with external geometries and internal configurations more similar to turbidite depositional systems (Fig. 17C). The depositional features form small channel-levees or channel-drifts within the channels or from the channel towards its margins, with symmetric to asymmetric external shapes (Fig. 17C). These depositional features are characterized by a steep flank closer to the submarine channel, which is frequently eroded. Erosion can also occur across both flanks, with the formation of small gullies or furrows. Channel-levees might have a larger, more developed levee on one side of the channel, and a smaller, less developed levee on the opposite margin (Fig. 10A; Miramontes et al., 2020b). Differences in dimensions are associated with preferential sediment redistribution downstream of the bottom current, which captures the fine-grained particles carried down-slope by the turbidity flows and preferentially redistributes them along the more developed levee (Miramontes et al., 2020b). Channel-levees tend to migrate laterally or slightly oblique to the margin trend (30\u201345\u00b0), according to the bottom current direction and\/or Coriolis forcing (Fig. 17C). Submarine channels can present low to high sinuosity and exhibit smaller dimensions overall, forming meandering to slightly sinuous erosional features (Fig. 17C). Channel bends downstream of the bottom current aid levee growth and lateral migration of the system, as lateral overspill from turbidity currents is preferentially redistributed towards the channel margin (Fig. 17C). Flume tank experiments show that secondary features, such as bedforms, can form along the channel-levees and appear even more developed across the larger channel-levee (Fig. 10A; Miramontes et al., 2020a). The bedforms are oblique (30\u201345\u00b0) to the channel trend and result from interactions between turbidity and bottom currents affecting the seafloor (Fig. 11). Examples comprise the mixed systems along the New Zealand margin (Carter and McCave, 2002; Lu et al., 2003; Kroeger et al., 2019; Bailey et al., 2021) and the Weddell Sea (Fig. 6I; Michels et al., 2001, 2002), as well as the Cenozoic deposits of the Pearl River Mouth System on the South China Sea (Fig. 10B; Gong et al., 2013, 2016).\nAlong the distal continental rise and abyssal plains, turbidite-dominated mixed systems are defined by deposition of laterally offset fan lobes (also called fan-drifts or contourite fans) (Fig. 17C). The fan lobes form extensive \u201calmond\u201d-shaped features, separated by wide U-shaped channels. Asynchronous or passive interactions between the down-slope turbidity flows and the along-slope bottom current lead to sediment redistribution and winnowing along-slope. The fan lobes extend laterally, downstream of the bottom current, and form lateral migrating stacks (Fig. 17C). Some examples of deviated fan lobes due to strong bottom current action have been identified along the Eocene-Oligocene deposits in the SE Brazilian basins (Viana et al., 2007; Viana, 2008; Mutti et al., 2014) and also in the Vema contourite fan system in the South Brazilian Basin (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1998). Strong bottom currents can also cause remobilization of sediments and form secondary features such as sand ribbons, sediment waves or barchan dunes (Fig. 17C; Mutti et al., 2014). Other bedforms might also be formed due to strong bottom currents, such as cross-laminations or ripples, as seen for the Pliocene to present-day record in the Gulf of Mexico (Shanmugam et al., 1993; Shanmugam, 2017).\n\n\n\n5.4\nSedimentary facies and deposits of mixed systems\nDespite the abundance of good quality seismic data, which has provided detailed descriptions for the geometries and external shapes of the main sedimentary bodies (Fig. 9; Mulder et al., 2008; Miramontes et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b), less information is available regarding the type of sedimentary facies developed along mixed systems (Shanmugam et al., 1993; Viana et al., 1998; Gong et al., 2016; Fonnesu et al., 2020). Outcrop examples are mostly undiscovered and difficult to link to a specific mixed system type (Stanley, 1987, 1993; Cauxeiro et al., 2020), and deep-water modern and ancient systems are very expensive to sample in extensive detail. However, some studies have recovered sediment cores across both the mounded drifts and the submarine channels (Lucchi et al., 2002; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; de Castro et al., 2020; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020). Their results reveal that the type and extent of the interaction between along- and down-slope processes determines the type of facies that is formed and preserved in the sedimentary record. Key examples of sedimentary facies have been observed in the Cretaceous to Paleogene mixed systems offshore Brazil (Mutti and Carminatti, 2012; Mutti et al., 2014), in the Mamba and Coral systems offshore Northern Mozambique (Fonnesu, 2013; Fonnesu et al., 2020) and in the PMAP mixed systems (Lucchi et al., 2002; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Hillenbrand et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022a). Based on these examples, the interaction between turbidity and bottom currents appears to form four distinct facies associations from the channel axis to the mounded drifts (Fig. 18\n), which are summarized here as: 1) axial facies composed of thick, massive or graded sands with absence of interbedded muds (interpreted as turbidite beds winnowed or stripped by bottom currents); 2) axial sand-rich facies with frequent erosive truncations, mudstones clasts, and abundant tractive structures such as medium-scale cross- to parallel-laminations (interpreted as turbidites reworked by high velocity bottom currents); 3) marginal facies composed of sand and mud alternations with complex sedimentary structures, such as ripples with mud drapes, sigmoidal ripples, and mud couplets that eventually transition towards bigradational sequences (interpreted as contourites built from the fine-grained fractions stripped from the turbidity currents and redeposited according to the bottom current direction); and 4) external facies consisting of highly bioturbated biogenic and terrigenous muds (interpreted as contourites and hemipelagites deposited along the mounded drifts). Other sedimentary facies may occur interbedded in mixed systems that did not result from interactions between turbidity and bottom currents, for example MTDs (Fig. 18; Gong et al., 2016; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022a) or hybrid events beds (Sansom, 2018; Fuhrmann et al., 2020).\n\n\n5.5\nControl factors and potential implications\nThe large diversity of mixed depositional systems is a major clue for the numerous control factors involved in their formation. At a short- to long-term, varying degrees of confinement, sediment supply, climatic or eustatic fluctuations have affected their growth and evolution (Fig. 19\n).\n\n5.5.1\nDegree of confinement in mixed systems\nAll the examples described in the literature (Figs. 6 and 12) suggest that significant differences in drift and channel dimensions that may be associated with the degree of confinement and accommodation space available across different slope settings. Steep V-shaped channels within upper to middle slopes tend to confine turbidity flows and thus become less exposed to sediment entrainment by bottom currents (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Such channels also tend to be deeply incised across the continental margin, limiting turbidity flow overspill and interactions with along-slope currents (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, large U-shaped channels and channel complex systems across the continental rise (Fig. 8C) and abyssal plains are characterized by extensive mounded drifts and allow frequent overspills from turbidity currents (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Therefore, in unconfined systems the turbulent cloud tends to reach heights greater than the channel margins, promoting sediment entrainment and redistribution by bottom currents (Supplementary Fig. S2B).\nAll the examples described in the literature (Figs. 6 and 12) suggest that significant differences in drift and channel dimensions that may be associated with the degree of confinement and accommodation space available across different slope settings.

Therefore, in unconfined systems the turbulent cloud tends to reach heights greater than the channel margins, promoting sediment entrainment and redistribution by bottom currents (Supplementary Fig. S2B).\nConsequently, confined mixed systems tend to form asymmetric channel-drifts near or within submarine channels (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Such systems display unilateral migration towards the channel thalweg, as frequent interactions between turbidity and bottom currents promote lateral and vertical drift growth towards the available space along the channel bed (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Modern examples comprise the channel-drifts formed across the Pearl River Mouth System in the South China Sea (Fig. 6E; Gong et al., 2013, 2015, 2016) and the unidirectional channels in the Zaire fan offshore Congo (Gong et al., 2018).\nConsequently, confined mixed systems tend to form asymmetric channel-drifts near or within submarine channels (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

Unconfined continental rise and\/or abyssal plains promote sediment build-up and lateral expansion, with an up- or down-current migration, depending on the bottom current direction (Fig. 8). The PMAP mixed systems comprise the most extensive examples currently known (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S2B).\nFor unconfined systems, elongated mounded drifts tend to have greater thicknesses and drift crests centred away from channel margins, as the bottom current is capable of remobilizing and carrying sediments over greater distances (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

The PMAP mixed systems comprise the most extensive examples currently known (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S2B).\n\n\n5.5.2\nThe role of bottom currents in mixed systems\nMost mixed systems are characterized by asymmetric mounded drifts or channel-drifts, (Fig. 6), suggesting that bottom currents play a fundamental role in shaping their external shapes and sedimentary stacking patterns (Figs. 15). These systems are further characterized by the main sedimentary facies that are observed in their deposits (Fig. 18), which derive from the type of interaction that occurs between along-slope bottom currents and down-slope gravity currents. Sediment entrainment via bottom current winnowing or reworking is often associated with build-up of bottom current reworked sands (BCRS; de Castro et al., 2020, 2021; Counts et al., 2021), gradual facies sequences, or partial cut-offs (Rodrigues et al., 2022a). Furthermore, phased interactions between bottom currents and gravity-driven currents (Fig. 16B) can produce alternations of turbidite and contourite beds, whereas synchronous to asynchronous interactions (Fig. 16A) result in reworked turbidite deposits (Viana et al., 1998, 1999; de Castro et al., 2020). Contrary to previous interpretations (Mulder et al., 2008), synchronous interactions frequently occur throughout mixed systems (Fig. 16A) and develop large- to small-scale features and deposits at the seismic to facies scale (Fig. 9; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Miramontes et al., 2020b, 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2021). Several mixed systems exhibit transitional or hybrid facies between the two end members (turbidites and contourites) due to regular, synchronous interactions between bottom and gravity currents (de Castro et al., 2020; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2022a). The mixed systems along the PMAP, Brazil and South China Sea are further characterized by cyclic stacking patterns (Fig. 6E and K; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Ding et al., 2021; Pandolpho et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022c), formed by switches between synchronous and asynchronous interactions (Gong et al., 2013, 2016; Pandolpho et al., 2021; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). As such, bottom currents are considered crucial for the development of mixed systems at various scales, as well as for their spatial and temporal variability.\n\n\n5.5.3\nThe contribution of gravity currents to mixed systems\nGravity-driven currents have always been considered the main sediment source for most mixed systems (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Mulder et al., 2008; Gong et al., 2013; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Hillenbrand et al., 2021). These currents are capable of carrying substantial amounts of sediment from the continent to the ocean and re-deposit them along deep-water environments (He et al., 2008; Meiburg and Kneller, 2010; Mutti, 2011). In mixed systems, this leads to frequent interactions with the along-slope current (Fig. 16), which strips the fine-grained particles and redistributes them towards intra-channel areas. However, gravity-driven currents have a deeper impact in mixed systems that has yet to be addressed. Their turbulent behaviour causes erosion at the seafloor and disturbs the substrate (Haughton et al., 2009; Paull et al., 2018), resulting in the formation of submarine channels and complex channel systems (Fig. 8). These morphological features are excellent conducts for sediment transport and promote further down-slope processes through sediment remobilization and instability (Haughton et al., 2009; Shanmugam, 2016; Azpiroz-Zabala et al., 2017a, 2017b; Paull et al., 2018). Indeed, many researchers have identified initial turbidite systems below the modern and ancient mixed systems (Rebesco et al., 1998, 2002; Creaser et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b), attesting to their impact across most continental margins. Therefore, gravity-driven currents frequently erode the previous morphological setting, creating channels and intra-channel areas along continental margins (Fig. 6). These geometries affect the pathway of the bottom current, which is forced to contour the intra-channel areas with high relief (Fig. 16; Campbell and Deptuck, 2012). The sediments will therefore be preferentially redistributed and preserved across intra-channel areas and, eventually, regular interactions between gravity currents and the bottom current will lead to the growth of down-slope elongated mounded drifts and unilateral migration (Fig. 15). Gravity-driven currents will therefore affect sediment redistribution and lateral system migration, as they precondition the previous slope morphology and may aid or restrict system growth (Fig. 19).\n\n\n5.5.4\nPaleoceanographic and paleoclimatic changes\nThe palaeoceanographic record, driven by climatic changes, can be studied through the internal stacking patterns of mounded drifts (Fig. 4; Faug\u00e8res et al., 1993; Knutz, 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014). The sedimentary stacking patterns are influenced by enhancements or recessions of the bottom current, as well as changes in sediment influx and deposition (Mulder et al., 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014). Therefore, mixed systems can be used to identify modifications of oceanic current activity and pathways, as well as the factors that induce local- and global-scale variations in thermohaline circulation, fundamental to understanding climate changes (Esmerode et al., 2008; Rebesco et al., 2014; Creaser et al., 2017; Hillenbrand et al., 2021).\nFor instance, the PMAP mixed systems are characterized by cyclic stratigraphic patterns and recurring sedimentary facies (Fig. 4C), which are in turn linked to shifts between glacial and interglacial stages (Lucchi et al., 2002; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2022c). Coarse-grained, thick deposits are frequently accumulated during glacial maxima, as paleo ice-streams supplied glaciogenic debris to the shelf break and, subsequently, to the mixed depositional systems through down-slope gravitational processes (Rebesco et al., 2002; Dowdeswell et al., 2004; Amblas et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017). During glacial stages, higher bottom current velocities were able to strip the fine-grained particles (Fig. 16), carried in suspension by the gravity-driven currents, and create bigradational sequences with alternating parallel- to cross-laminated very fine- to coarse-grained sands along the mounded drifts (Fig. 18; Rodrigues et al., 2022a). Other high- to low-latitude systems also show alternations between contourite and turbidite deposits (Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020, 2022), suggesting that bottom current enhancements or recessions and the frequency of gravity-driven flows may be tied to significant climatic oscillations (Clausen, 1998b; Escutia et al., 2002; Michels et al., 2001; Gr\u00fctzner et al., 2003; Rasmussen et al., 2003; Forwick et al., 2015; Garc\u00eda et al., 2016; Salabarnada et al., 2018). These studies reveal that mixed systems are built by numerous interactions between turbidity and bottom currents, and as such, form complex deposits and geometries at a seismic and outcrop scale.\n\n\n5.5.5\nSlope stability\nThe analysis of slope stability in areas significantly affected by along- and down-slope processes has been an important aspect to study (Supplementary Fig. S3; Laberg et al., 2005; Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Neves et al., 2016; Teixeira et al., 2019; Maselli and Kneller, 2018). An example of this is seen in the PMAP (see Diviacco et al., 2006; Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Volpi et al., 2016). In mixed depositional systems, gravitational processes are regular occurrences, since down-slope gravity currents are generally associated with unstable sediments, oversteep slopes or heavy channel incision (Supplementary Fig. S3). These are some of the triggers or pre-conditioning factors that can lead to mass-transport events (Masson et al., 2006; Urlaub et al., 2013). This also indicates a region prone to geologic hazards, which could affect the infrastructures at the seafloor, coastal areas and even populations (Camerlenghi et al., 2007).\nThe analysis of slope stability in areas significantly affected by along- and down-slope processes has been an important aspect to study (Supplementary Fig. S3; Laberg et al., 2005; Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008; Neves et al., 2016; Teixeira et al., 2019; Maselli and Kneller, 2018).

This also indicates a region prone to geologic hazards, which could affect the infrastructures at the seafloor, coastal areas and even populations (Camerlenghi et al., 2007).\nVigorous bottom currents can also locally erode the seafloor, provoking sediment instability and triggering potentially hazardous mass-flow events (Mulder et al., 2003; Laberg et al., 2005; Viana et al., 2007; Maselli and Kneller, 2018; Miramontes et al., 2018a, 2018b). Moreover, several studies have shown that contourites are one of the predisposition factors for areas characterized by slope instability (Supplementary Fig. S3). This predisposition is due to the composition and physical properties of contourites (Solheim et al., 2005; Laberg and Camerlenghi, 2008), as their low-permeability, high plasticity and high pore-water content favours the formation of over-pressurised gliding surfaces when compared to glaciomarine sediments (Bryn et al., 2005; Rebesco, 2005). It has also been shown in the Mediterranean Sea that contourites present similar physical and mechanical properties to hemipelagites and in this case, slope instability is mainly controlled by the convex shape of contourite drifts, which are characterize by steep slopes in their lower parts (Miramontes et al., 2018a).\nVigorous bottom currents can also locally erode the seafloor, provoking sediment instability and triggering potentially hazardous mass-flow events (Mulder et al., 2003; Laberg et al., 2005; Viana et al., 2007; Maselli and Kneller, 2018; Miramontes et al., 2018a).

High amplitude reflections (HARs) are often linked to sand-rich intervals and imply potential prospects for future exploration (Gong et al., 2016; Sansom, 2017, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Fuhrmann et al., 2020). The Cretaceous mixed systems offshore Nova Scotia, Argentina and Uruguay (Fig. 4A and B), and the Paleogene deposits along the Mozambican and Tanzanian margins (Fig. 6F and J), are characterized by HARs across the submarine channels that extend laterally into the mounded drifts. Such extension of the HARs is a result of bottom current redistribution of coarse- to fine-grained particles, carried in suspension by the turbidity flows (Creaser et al., 2017; Sansom, 2018; Fonnesu et al., 2020; Rodrigues et al., 2021, 2022b). The bottom current redistributes the different fractions according to its competency (e.g., the grain size threshold), forming intercalations of sand-rich reservoirs and mud-rich seals (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, mixed systems present several potential targets, within both the channels and the mounded drifts (Supplementary Fig. S4).\nAn important aspect of mixed systems is their economic relevance for Energy Geosciences.

Therefore, mixed systems present several potential targets, within both the channels and the mounded drifts (Supplementary Fig. S4).\nFurthermore, their economic potential has increased after proving the existence of contouritic sand-rich oil-bearing beds in the Eocene-Oligocene of the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil (Viana et al., 2007; Viana, 2008; Mutti et al., 2014). In this interval, coarse sand-rich beds have high net-to-gross ratios with an average porosity of 15\u201325% and up to 35% (Viana et al., 2007; Mutti et al., 2014). Since then, a few contouritic beds with proven reserves have been described in the North Sea (Enjorlas et al., 1986) and in the Gulf of Mexico (Shanmugam et al., 1993; Shanmugam, 2017). In more recent years, two giant gas reservoirs with 2.32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 m3 of volume were identified in the Eocene-Oligocene record and associated with a mixed system along the northern Mozambican margin \u2014the Coral and Mamba fields (Fig. 6F; Fonnesu, 2013; Fonnesu et al., 2020). These gas reservoirs presented an impressive 82% net-to-gross ratio with an average porosity of 16.9% (Fonnesu et al., 2020). The gas fields are related to the development of asymmetric, migrating fan lobes due to synchronous interactions between along- and down-slope processes (Fonnesu et al., 2020), suggesting substantial promise for future research and exploration.\nThese sand-rich deposits may also be useful for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CO2 is one of the most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gases on Earth, contributing to climate change and gradual rise of the global temperature. CCS may thus represent a potential action for hydrocarbon exploration industries and other entities to reduce the concentration and release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Many CCS facilities consist of abandoned offshore oil and gas wells (for example, the Sleipner gas field in the North Sea; Gale et al., 2001; Akervoll et al., 2009). The architecture and properties of CCS facilities strongly resemble those of hydrocarbon reservoirs (such as high porosity and permeability and good grain-size heterogeneity). As such, the sand-rich reservoirs identified in mixed systems may serve an additional purpose other than hydrocarbon exploration.\nOver the past decades, the exploration industry has focused its efforts primarily on down-slope products and processes. Yet we are now witnessing a shift in this paradigm, thanks to empirical and technological advances made in bottom current research, proving the importance of its deposits for reservoirs, seals and source rocks. Attention is now being turned to the often-overlooked mixed deposits and bottom current reworked turbidites (Supplementary Fig. S4; Viana et al., 2007; Viana, 2008; Mutti, 2011; Palamenghi et al., 2015; Sansom, 2017, 2018; de Castro et al., 2020; Counts et al., 2021). Even though the study of mixed systems \u2014among the broader fields of turbidite and contourite systems\u2014 is still in its infancy, future studies will contribute to the present pool of knowledge and help unearth cases unidentified to date.\nOver the past decades, the exploration industry has focused its efforts primarily on down-slope products and processes.

Our study tries to address the similarities and differences between all currently known cases, and to provide a better understanding of the wide range of features and deposits formed in mixed (turbidite-contourite) systems. In light of our observations, we have proposed a new three-part classification scheme for mixed systems based on their location, elongation, dimensions, lateral migration, spatial and temporal variability: 1) contourite-dominated mixed systems, 2) synchronous systems, and 3) turbidite-dominated mixed systems. Diverse interactions between along- and down-slope processes appear to occur across these systems, from synchronous (where the bottom and turbidity currents occur coevally in time and space) to asynchronous and passive interactions (where the bottom and turbidity currents do not interact in time and more rarely, in space). These interactions are held responsible for building a myriad of deposits across proximal to distal depositional settings, such as mixed \/ hybrid sedimentary facies, interfingering sequences of contourites and turbidites or reworked turbidite deposits. This new classification scheme can thus be used in ongoing studies or future research to better understand the interactions between down- and along-slope processes as well as their resulting products.\nAs in many marine sciences, this research depends strongly on new scientific discoveries and sound empirical data to improve the previously proposed models. One essential task is to fully understand the connection between contourites and turbidites in mixed depositional systems. Scale and time are two crucial factors to determine how that connection is made. As a result, it's of primary importance that we establish conceptual and sedimentary models for mixed systems that will address these issues and provide a realistic view of the variability of their deposits and processes. Collaborations among geologists, sedimentologists and physical oceanographers are vigorously encouraged to approach mixed depositional systems from a combined perspective of sedimentology and fluid dynamics. Ideally, future research should pursue the following aspects:\n\n1.\nInteractions between down-slope gravity currents and along-slope bottom currents are incredibly complex, and therefore, modern seafloor monitoring (such as mooring deployments) should be conducted across submarine channels and mounded drifts to provide real current measurements, record individual (and\/or secondary) processes, and test the hypotheses proposed in this and other studies;\n\n\n2.\nRecent studies have reported that mixed systems tend to migrate up- or down-current, creating dissimilar interpretations and hindering their identification in ancient records. Numerical models or virtual simulations, coupled with flume-tank experiments and modern examples at the seafloor, could provide accurate predictions for the different types of features and deposits formed by the interactions between bottom and gravity currents;\n\n\n3.\nMixed depositional systems are characterized by extremely variable sedimentary facies, from turbidites and MTDs to contourites, hemipelagites and transitional facies. New studies at the facies scale would allow for a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variations formed within their deposits, and their correlation to external controlling factors (such as climatic changes or sea-level fluctuations);\n\n\n4.\nAncient mixed depositional systems are severely underrepresented, both offshore (buried below the present-day seafloor) and onshore (in outcrops). The identification and characterization of other ancient system would further their recognition and offer a broader understanding of their distribution across the Mesozoic and Cenozoic records;\n\n\n5.\nGiven that several mixed depositional systems have been identified until the present-day, rigorous measurements of their morphological features and other characteristics would provide a basis for statistical comparisons and critical evaluations of the proposed conceptual models, as well as adjustments for future classification systems.\n\n\n\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Fig. S1\n\nElevation profiles across three distinct depositional systems: A) Cretaceous to Eocene mixed systems off Nova Scotia (profiles A-F); B) Cretaceous mixed systems on the Argentine margin (profiles G-J); and C) modern mixed systems along the PMAP (profiles KO).

They can be divided into light REE (LREE, from La to Nd), middle REE (MREE, from Sm to Dy), and heavy REE (HREE, from Ho to Lu) following their atomic numbers. REE concentrations are generally reported after normalisation (expressed as subscript N) to a standard, commonly chondrite (e.g. C1 chondrite) or shale (e.g. post-Archean Australian Shale; PAAS), in order to remove the natural abundance variations (Masuda, 1962; Coryell et al., 1963; Elderfield, 1988) inherited from nucleosynthesis in supernovae and\/or colliding neutron stars, and crustal processes. In the resulting REY (or REE\u00a0+\u00a0Y) \u2018spider\u2019 diagrams, yttrium is commonly inserted between Dy and Ho because of the similar ionic potentials (size and charge) of Y and Ho (Bau, 1996).\nThe REE behave as a coherent group in geochemical systems mainly due to their similar electronic configurations. The ionic radii of REE become smaller with atomic number due to the progressive filling up of the 4f-electron sub-shell, which explains observed inter-elemental fractionation among the REE during crustal and biogeochemical processes (Goldberg et al., 1963; De Baar et al., 1985; McLennan, 1989; German and Elderfield, 1990a; Bau and M\u00f6ller, 1993). In terms of seawater, the disparity in stability constants between adsorption onto particle surfaces and complexation with inorganic ligands serves as the main factor controlling REE fractionation (Elderfield, 1988; Byrne and Kim, 1990; Schijf et al., 2015). Specifically, HREE are preferentially complexed with carbonate ions, while LREE are preferentially scavenged by coatings of organic matter and\/or Fe\/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, leading to LREE depletion in oxic seawater (Sholkovitz et al., 1994) that is commonly estimated using the shale-normalized PrN\/YbN ratio. Lanthanum (La) and gadolinium (Gd) are slightly enriched relative to neighbouring REE in chondrite\/shale-normalised REE patterns due to increased stabilities as a consequence of their respective empty and half-filled 4f electron shells. Such anomalies are also referred to as \u2018tetrad effects\u2019 with possible but generally negligible anomalies at a quarter (between Nd and Pm), three-quarters (between Ho and Er), and completely full (Lu) 4f electron shells (e.g. Masuda and Ikeuchi, 1979; De Baar et al., 1985; Byrne and Kim, 1990; McLennan, 1994; Bolhar et al., 2005; De Baar et al., 2018). Y and Ho show limited fractionation during weathering with Y being preferentially removed into weathering fluid, leading to a slightly higher Y\/Ho ratio (~28; weight ratio) in river water relative to the upper continental crust (Babechuk et al., 2015). Decoupling of Y and Ho mainly occurs in the open ocean due to higher surface complexation stabilities of Ho with respect to Y, which results in a superchondritic Y\/Ho ratio (>40; Nozaki et al., 1997).\nCompared with the strictly trivalent REE, cerium (Ce) and europium (Eu) are the only commonly multivalent elements among the REE. While reduction of Eu(III) to Eu(II) is thought to occur only in the sub-surface during magmatic and hydrothermal processes (Bau, 1991), soluble Ce(III) is readily oxidized to insoluble Ce(IV) that desorbs much less efficiently from particulate matter, leading to considerable depletion of Ce with respect to its REE neighbours, or a negative Ce anomaly, in oxygenated seawater (De Baar et al., 1985; Michard and Albar\u00e8de, 1986; Sholkovitz et al., 1994; Bau and Koschinsky, 2009). Ce anomaly values are <1 in the case of a negative Ce anomaly, i.e. Ce depletion relative to neighbouring REE (normalised to chondrite or shale) and\u00a0>\u00a01 in the case of a positive Ce anomaly or relative Ce enrichment. Under more reducing marine conditions, reductive dissolution of Fe\/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides and\/or remineralisation of organic matter will reduce the magnitude of LREE depletion, Y enrichment and Ce depletion (or produce a positive Ce anomaly) (De Baar et al., 1988; German et al., 1991; Bau et al., 1997). Given the relatively short oceanic residence time of Ce (<200\u00a0yrs.; Alibo and Nozaki, 1999), the Ce anomaly in seawater is believed to reflect local to regional redox conditions and\/or integrated redox history of a particular water mass (German and Elderfield, 1990a), and has been widely applied to probe ancient ocean redox states (e.g. McArthur and Walsh, 1984; Bau and M\u00f6ller, 1993; Webb and Kamber, 2000; Shields and Stille, 2001; Nothdurft et al., 2004; Planavsky et al., 2010; Kamber et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018a).\nThe seawater dissolved REE are transferred into sediments either by sorption to particles (e.g. Fe\/Mn oxides, organic matter, silica) or by substituting for Ca2+ in carbonate minerals and phosphate minerals. Accordingly, the REE in bulk carbonate rocks, iron formations (IFs), phosphorites, and cherts have been frequently measured, and their seawater-like REE patterns suggest that they can preserve seawater REE distributions without significant fractionation (German and Elderfield, 1990a; Murray et al., 1992; Webb and Kamber, 2000; Bekker et al., 2014). Mudstones are also commonly analysed for their REE contents, despite the reasonable assumption that most mudstones have practically indistinguishable REE distribution patterns from international shale standards. Nevertheless, the REE patterns of authigenic marine sediments are seldom normalised to mudstones from the same stratigraphic succession that presumably represents the local supply. Although iron speciation and redox-sensitive elemental (RSE; e.g. U, Mo, V, and Re) studies of mudstones (and authigenic pyrites) have significantly advanced our knowledge of paleo-ocean redox conditions (e.g. Poulton and Canfield, 2005; Partin et al., 2013; Large et al., 2014; Sperling et al., 2015; Large et al., 2019), the meaning of Ce anomalies in mudstones is relatively poorly understood. Negative Ce anomalies in organic-rich shales were employed recently to corroborate Mesoproterozoic oxygenation (Canfield et al., 2018), but it has been suggested that secondary oxidation, potentially by weathering, may have contributed to Ce depletion (Planavsky et al., 2020). In addition, Ce anomalies in organic matter, an important REE carrier in seawater, are rarely investigated specifically (e.g. Felitsyn and Morad, 2002), and definitely require more study.\nDue to its importance in redox reconstruction, several Ce anomaly compilations have been reported. Kato et al. (2006) compiled Ce anomalies from Precambrian IFs in Greenland, Finland, India, South Africa, and Australia, and suggested that the ocean has been oxygenated since ca. 3.8\u00a0Ga and reached a modern-like, highly oxic state by 2.9\u20132.7\u00a0Ga. Although they argued that the compiled IFs were free from the influence of weathering and detritus and therefore preserved primary seawater chemistry, anomalous REE patterns (their Fig. 3) permit the possibility that compiled Ce anomalies were altered by post-depositional processes. There is mounting evidence suggesting that IFs are prone to secondary alteration (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2004; Bonnand et al., 2020). In another study, Komiya et al. (2008) performed in-situ analyses of REE of carbonate minerals in carbonate rocks and basalts with least altered textures. Their results indicate that the surface environment became more oxic after 2.7\u00a0Ga but with a substantial increase in the Phanerozoic. However, their data were mainly obtained from Archean, early Paleoproterozoic and Ediacaran rocks in spite of the large number of samples analysed. Kamber et al. (2014) also reviewed the Ce anomalies in Archean sedimentary rocks and suggested that those previously reported cases of non-unity values were most likely artefacts. More recently, Wallace et al. (2017) analysed REE mainly from marine cements and compiled Ce anomaly data obtained from whole carbonate rocks, which were generally deposited in shallow marine environments from the late Tonian to the present. The authors suggested that although there was an oxygenation event in the late Ediacaran, the oceans did not become fully oxygenated until the late Devonian. However, they did not compile Ce anomalies of other chemical sedimentary rocks, e.g. iron formations and phosphorites, and have gaps in their coverage especially for the pre-Tonian period. As a consequence, a full picture of marine redox evolution from the perspective of the Ce anomaly is yet to emerge as all previous studies focussed either on specific time intervals or rock components only. With greatly increasing amounts of REE data from chemical sedimentary rocks generated by refined preparation and analytical techniques in recent years (e.g. Zhang et al., 2015; Tostevin et al., 2016a; Cao et al., 2020a), we feel that a more complete Ce anomaly compilation is both timely and important for improving our understanding of the redox evolution of the ancient surface environment.\nIn this contribution, our purpose is mainly threefold. First, combined with our own analyses, we compile REE data in chemical sedimentary rocks deposited in different marine environments and screen the data based on specific criteria. Here, we report a relatively complete sedimentary Ce anomaly compilation for the first time. Second, we discuss the meaning of Ce anomalies in shales and provide a case study of the Member IV\/Miaohe shales of the Doushantuo Formation in South China. We also investigate the potential influence of weathering on Ce anomalies in shales. Finally, based on the Ce anomaly compilation, we track responses of Ce anomalies to major events during Earth system evolution through the Archean to the Phanerozoic. We thereby provide informative complementary information about seawater redox evolution from the perspective of the Ce anomaly.\n\n\n2\nREE distribution as a redox proxy\n\n2.1\nREE distributions in modern oceans and basins\n\n2.1.1\nOpen ocean\nSince the pioneering study of Goldberg et al. (1963), the distribution of REE in seawater has been widely investigated around the world in areas, such as the Atlantic Ocean (Elderfield and Greaves, 1982), the Pacific Ocean (Piepgras and Jacobsen, 1992), and the Southern Ocean (Hathorne et al., 2015). In general, dissolved REE concentrations, except for Ce, increase with increasing water depth (Fig. 1a-c) due to the release of REE from downward-settling particles, including organic matter and Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides, which scavenged REE in surface waters (Elderfield and Greaves, 1982; De Baar et al., 1983, 1985). As a result, REE depth profiles bear a resemblance to the distribution of major nutrients such as dissolved nitrate, phosphate, and silica, suggesting that REE distribution in the ocean is related to biogeochemical cycling and that biogenic particles may play an important role in shaping the REE patterns. In the central North Pacific (De Baar et al., 2018), the western North Pacific (Piepgras and Jacobsen, 1992), and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Hathorne et al., 2015), the REE concentrations show significant covariation with dissolved phosphate and\/or nitrate concentrations within a certain water depth range (generally <1000\u00a0m), indicating that biogeochemical cycling of REE is associated with the cycling of marine organic matter. The coincidence between neodymium concentration [Nd] minima and chlorophyll maxima in near-surface waters of the central North Pacific (De Baar et al., 2018) and eastern North Atlantic (Stichel et al., 2015) also suggests that REE are scavenged by planktic material that upon remineralization can lead to release of phosphate, nitrate, and REE at depth. REE release from sinking organic matter is specifically confirmed by positive covariation between [Nd] and AOU (Apparent Oxygen Utilization) (Stichel et al., 2015).\nOn the other hand, the relationships between REE and dissolved silica concentrations are more ambiguous. For example, REE exhibit weak covariations with dissolved silica concentrations in the North Pacific (Piepgras and Jacobsen, 1992) and South Pacific (Molina-Kescher et al., 2014), strong covariation in the southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (Garcia-Solsona et al., 2014), and no covariation in the eastern South Atlantic (Zheng et al., 2016). Henry et al. (1994) found low Nd concentration (0.3\u00a0ppm) in biogenic material that was dominated by diatoms. It is, therefore, suggested that although silica could be a minor carrier of REE, it does not govern the general shape of REE depth profiles in seawater. Apart from biogenic particles, Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides can also scavenge REE through adsorption, affecting the cycling of REE in the ocean, details of which are discussed in Section 2.1.2.\nREE depth profiles in the modern open ocean are also controlled by water mass circulation, which could in some cases lead to deviations from typical seawater profiles. For example, Piepgras and Jacobsen (1992) investigated the REE depth profiles in the western North Pacific and found decreasing REE concentrations towards the seafloor, which was attributed to the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water that has a relatively low REE content. Indeed, by using Nd isotopes and improved understanding of modern ocean currents, it has been suggested that vertical distributions of REE in the open oceans are mainly controlled by water mass circulation and mixing (Zheng et al., 2016; De Baar et al., 2018).\nGiven its redox sensitivity, dissolved Ce concentration depth profiles are different from other strictly trivalent REE. Typically, Ce concentrations decrease rapidly with increasing water depth in the shallow ocean and remain unchanged or increase only slightly in the deep ocean (Sholkovitz et al., 1994). Ce anomaly values tend to decrease with depth in shallow seawater (generally <500\u00a0m) and remain unchanged in deep waters (Fig. 1d). The surface [Ce] maximum in the open ocean may result from aeolian input (e.g. Deng et al., 2017) and\/or low Ce oxidation rates in the upper photic zone, photo-inhibition of Ce oxidation and photoreduction of Ce(IV) (Moffett, 1990), while the rapid decrease in [Ce] and Ce anomaly values below the surface maximum is attributed to strong Ce oxidation and removal in the presence of reactive particles such as Mn\/Fe oxyhydroxides and\/or microbes. It has been suggested that negative Ce anomalies in seawater result from adsorption of all REE(III) including Ce(III) onto reactive particle surfaces (e.g. Mn\/Fe oxyhydroxides), followed by further oxidation of Ce with Mn and\/or Fe serving as the electron acceptor (Ohta and Kawabe, 2001; Bau and Koschinsky, 2009; De Baar et al., 2018).\nIn addition to the typical seawater REE distribution outlined above, [Ce] and Ce anomaly values have been reported to be significantly higher in the bottom waters of some areas (e.g. the southeastern Atlantic Ocean; Fig. 1a, d), and this has been attributed to the benthic flux from sediments that are rich in soluble Ce (III) and\/or the remineralization of particles that release excess REE into bottom waters. Although De Baar et al. (1983) reported positive Ce anomalies in fully oxygenated surface seawater, these were later interpreted to be analytical artefacts (De Baar, 1991).\nUnlike dissolved REE concentration depth profiles, the shapes of shale-normalised REE patterns in modern oceans are much more uniform but do show systematic changes through water depth (Fig. 1e, f). In general, shale-normalised REE patterns are characterized by progressive enrichment from LREE to HREE (i.e. positive slope), La and Gd enrichment (positive La and Gd anomalies), strong Ce depletion (negative Ce anomaly) and Y enrichment (superchondritic Y\/Ho ratio) (Fig. 1e). A closer look shows that LREE become progressively depleted with increasing depth in shallow seawater but less so in deep water, as evidenced by varying PrN\/YbN ratios with water depth (see Fig. 4 of Kamber et al., 2014). This has been attributed to the preferential removal of LREE onto particles in shallow seawater that is followed by their preferential regeneration at depth (e.g. Sholkovitz et al., 1994).\nDeviations from typical REE depth profiles and\/or shale-normalized REE patterns also occur where the environments are unusual, such as at or near the mid-ocean ridges and oxygen-minimum zones (OMZs). Near the mid-ocean ridge where hydrothermal flux is high, shale-normalized REE patterns of hydrothermal fluids are relatively flat, except for strongly enriched Eu (Derry and Jacobsen, 1990). The low Eu3+\/Eu2+ redox boundary makes it unlikely that Eu3+ can be reduced in normal surface environments as its redox potential is strongly influenced by temperature (Elderfield, 1988; Bau, 1991). At higher temperatures (>200\u00a0\u00b0C), Eu can be reduced to a divalent state and thereby become fractionated with respect to other REE (Michard and Albar\u00e8de, 1986). Therefore, sediments and rocks formed under the influence of hydrothermal fluids may exhibit large positive Eu anomalies. Specifically, the IFs show pronounced positive Eu anomalies before ~2.7\u20132.5\u00a0Ga (Kato et al., 2006), when the ratio of hydrothermal flux to riverine flux into the anoxic Archean ocean was likely much greater than at present (Derry and Jacobsen, 1990). Such prominent anomalies possibly resulted from less significant scavenging of hydrothermal REE by plume particles (e.g. Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides) (Olivarez and Owen, 1991). It is also interesting to note that the Eu anomalies of Neoarchean IFs are generally minor, even though contemporaneous hydrogenous sediments exhibit relatively unradiogenic Sr isotope compositions (e.g. Chen et al., 2022a). It has been proposed that such a paradox could imply the existence of juvenile oceanic plateaux that were an important source of unradiogenic Sr into the ocean but represented a less significant source of Eu (Kamber, 2010). On the other hand, positive Eu anomalies can also be introduced during the course of intensive plagioclase weathering owing to the propensity of Eu2+ to substitute for Ca2+ and\/or Sr2+ during crystallization of feldspar (Weill and Drake, 1973).\nOMZs are characterized by low or depleted oxygen levels in intermediate waters as a result of decomposition of settling organics from the photic zone (Canfield et al., 2019). Moving downward into the OMZs, both REE concentrations and Ce anomaly values increase sharply across their tops and then gradually decrease with increasing water depth, as found in the Pacific Ocean (De Baar et al., 1985), the mechanisms of which are similar to those occurring in a redox stratified basin as discussed in Section 2.1.2.\n\n\n2.1.2\nRedox stratified basin\nUnderstanding the REE distribution in modern redox stratified basins is of great help in deciphering Precambrian marine environments because of their steep redox gradients. Based on observations in anoxic basins (e.g. Cariaco Trench, Black Sea, and Saanich Inlet), dissolved REE concentrations are higher in deeper anoxic waters relative to the overlying well-oxygenated shallower waters (Fig. 2a-c). Ce anomalies of filtered seawater change from negative to less negative and\/or positive across the redox boundary (Fig. 2d). Given the mirrored distributions of particulate concentrations of REE, Fe, and Mn, these dissolved REE distributions are believed to be associated with precipitation of Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides above, and reductive dissolution below the redox boundary (De Baar et al., 1988; German and Elderfield, 1989; German et al., 1991). While the removal and regeneration of trivalent REE that intrinsically do not show redox chemistry are indirectly coupled to cycling of Fe and Mn by adsorption-desorption, Ce is cycled through additional oxidative-reductive processes. The coupling of Ce with Mn in the suboxic zone of the Black Sea further suggests that Ce can be reduced under suboxic and anoxic conditions (Fig. 2d; German et al., 1991). It should be mentioned that although dissolution of settling particles tends to diminish HREE enrichment and Y\/Ho ratios in deeper, more reducing waters (Fig. 2e), REE patterns still resemble those of the open ocean (except for Ce anomaly).\nAlthough it is widely accepted that Mn and Fe (oxyhydr)oxides are important adsorptive scavengers of REE in seawater given high REE contents of modern ocean ferromanganese crusts and nodules, the relative importance of Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides in the oxidative scavenging of Ce remains elusive. While Koeppenkastrop and De Carlo (1992) observed a positive Ce anomaly only on synthesized vernadite, but not on goethite, Bau (1999) reported evidence for oxidative scavenging of Ce onto Fe oxyhydroxides in the light of a series of scavenging experiments. Ohta and Kawabe (2001) observed REE distribution coefficient discrepancies between Mn, Fe oxyhydroxides and solutions, and proposed that Ce might be oxidized in the presence of Fe oxyhydroxides, but less readily than with Mn oxyhydroxides. More recently, Bau and Koschinsky (2009) reported similarly pronounced positive Ce anomalies in Mn and Fe oxides that are leached from ferromanganese crusts, leading to a conclusion that oxidative scavenging of Ce is not restricted to Mn oxides. Therefore, the question on the relative importance of Fe and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides in the oxidative scavenging of Ce is still open to debate.\nIt is noteworthy that in addition to anoxic basins, positive Ce anomalies have been found in the water column of alkaline lakes due to the stabilization of Ce(IV)-carbonate complexes (M\u00f6ller and Bau, 1993). Moreover, Pourret et al. (2008) discovered negative Ce anomalies in the dissolved fraction (<0.2\u00a0\u03bcm) of organic-rich alkaline waters, which was attributed to the preferential adsorption of Ce(IV) to humic acids. It is also interesting to note that negative Ce anomalies in Mn (oxyhydr)oxides have been attributed to Desferrioxamine B (DFOB), which is a siderophore organic ligand that is usually synthesized by microbes to dissolve Fe(III)-bearing minerals in case of iron deficiency. Duckworth and Sposito (2005) suggested that the DFOB tends to lower the oxidation potential of complexed metal, thus promoting the oxidation of Ce(III)-DFOB to Ce(IV)-DFOB. The stronger stability of Ce(IV)-DFOB in solution prevents its being scavenged by solid phases. Alternatively, Kraemer et al. (2017) proposed that Ce(IV)-DFOB, due to its stability in solution, operates as a redox pump facilitating the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) at the mineral\/solution interface, producing positive Ce anomalies in the DFOB available solution.\nThe polysaccharides, weak organic ligands that are abundant in the surface ocean (nmol\/L\u2013\u03bcmol\/L; Benner et al., 1992), may play a major role in regulating Ce anomalies. Deng et al. (2020) demonstrated that polysaccharides can give rise to negative Ce anomalies on Mn (oxyhydr)oxides during their precipitation. They suggested that this is because Mn (oxyhydr)oxides complex with polysaccharide molecules, thus inhibiting the binding of REE and Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, and that Ce(IV) oxidized by Mn (oxyhydr)oxides through organic molecule-mediated electron transfer forms a more stable complex with polysaccharide in the solution. Since polysaccharides are the main constituents of dissolved organic matter (Benner et al., 1992), such work paves the way for better understanding the role of organic matter in marine REE cycling.\n\n\n\n2.2\nPreservation of primary marine REE signals in geological records\nAs the fractionation of REE is directly or indirectly related to the marine redox state, REE signals in chemical sedimentary rocks (e.g. carbonate rocks, iron formations, phosphorites, and cherts) and in the authigenic parts of shales (e.g. Dumoulin et al., 2011; Pi et al., 2013), which are thought to faithfully preserve seawater chemistry (e.g. Webb and Kamber, 2000; Bekker et al., 2014), have been employed to reconstruct paleo-ocean redox conditions. However, shale-normalised REE patterns of marine sedimentary rocks and minerals are potentially subject to secondary alteration, either during diagenetic exchange with porewaters, which generally results in REE enrichment and deviation from their primary patterns or weathering related REE mobilisation. In addition, detrital contamination may be introduced during diagenesis and sample digestion, which tends to flatten the primary REE patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the secondary alteration and detrital contamination before utilizing these proxies.\n\n2.2.1\nDiagenetic alteration\nGiven the high partition coefficients of REE between calcite and seawater (>100; Zhong and Mucci, 1995; Webb and Kamber, 2000) and the generally low REE concentrations in diagenetic fluids, carbonate REE patterns are thought to be resistant to diagenetic alteration unless under extremely high water\/rock ratios (>104; Banner and Hanson, 1990). It has been demonstrated that burial dolomitization may not significantly alter REE patterns of carbonate rocks although it can change Sr and O isotope characteristics (Banner et al., 1988). Webb et al. (2009) determined that the REE patterns of neomorphic calcite remained largely intact during vadose diagenesis, although there is clear evidence for REE (including Ce) remobilisation. More recent studies on carbonate rocks and modern carbonate sediments reveal that despite mineralogical transformations, neither meteoric diagenesis nor marine burial diagenesis will systematically change the REE compositions of clean\/pure carbonate rocks (Hood et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). However, as implicitly shown in Webb et al. (2009), the REE patterns of impure carbonate rocks that have interacted with non-marine fluids derived from non-carbonate phases are more likely to be altered. For example, saddle dolomites associated with hot reducing brines show characteristics of LREE enrichment, positive Eu anomalies, and reduced Y\/Ho ratios (Hood et al., 2018); burial dolomite cements influenced by iron reduction exhibit MREE enrichment with higher REE concentrations (Hood et al., 2018); and calcites formed during thermochemical sulfate reduction have relatively flat REE patterns with positive Eu anomalies and unusually high Y\/Ho ratios (Jiang et al., 2015).\nBiogenic apatite is thermodynamically metastable and is more likely to suffer from REE exchange during diagenetic recrystallisation over a long time span (Reynard et al., 1999; Shields and Stille, 2001; Joosu et al., 2016). Consequently, biogenic apatite, often characterized by a MREE enrichment pattern (i.e. bell or hat-shaped REE patterns; e.g. Chen et al., 2015a), is not an ideal proxy material for preserving primary seawater REE signals. The diagenetic enrichment of MREE has been characterized by a DyN\/SmN ratio (Shields and Stille, 2001) and\/or a bell-shaped index (Bodin et al., 2013; Tostevin et al., 2016a). In contrast to biogenic apatite, sedimentary phosphorite, a more thermodynamically stable phosphate phase, usually francolite or carbonate fluorapatite, may record the REE characteristics of bottom waters, given that phosphorites are formed at a relatively shallow sedimentary depth during early diagenesis (German and Elderfield, 1990a; Ilyin, 1998). However, it has been shown that while the phosphorite cores can preserve seawater-like REE patterns and relatively low REE concentrations, continuous uptake of REE from pore waters during early diagenesis can result in LREE and MREE enriched patterns and high REE concentrations in phosphorite rims (almost an order of magnitude higher than that in cores) (e.g. Zhu and Jiang, 2017; Lumiste et al., 2019). Kidder et al. (2003) also demonstrated that the MREE enrichment in phosphate concretions is compensated by the MREE depletion in the nearby organic-rich host shales, suggesting the mobilization of REE during early diagenesis. Therefore, some so-called \u2018old phosphorite\u2019 REE patterns characterized by MREE enrichment may not necessarily indicate secular changes in seawater composition as previously suggested (McArthur and Walsh, 1984; Ilyin, 1998; Picard et al., 2002; Emsbo et al., 2015). The observation that many Phanerozoic non-phosphorite marine sedimentary rocks exhibit modern seawater-like REE patterns also refutes such secular variation (Shields and Webb, 2004). It has been proposed that MREE are preferentially incorporated into apatite crystals due to their similar ionic radii with Ca (e.g. Morad and Felitsyn, 2001; Joosu et al., 2015). However, Nd and Sm are closest to Ca in ionic radius since REE generally prefer a seven-coordinated Ca2+ site with an ionic radius of 1.06\u00a0\u00c5 (Shannon, 1976; Wright et al., 1987; Hughes et al., 1991; Pan and Fleet, 2002). It has also been proposed that MREE enrichment could be a result of apatite precipitation in the Fe(Mn)-oxide reduction zone of porewaters (e.g. Haley et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2015a). In addition, MREE enrichment may reflect the REE source characteristic presumably derived from organic matter since phosphogenesis is generally related to organic matter decomposition (e.g. Pi et al., 2013).\n\n\n2.2.2\nWeathering\nPhosphorite REE characteristics can be altered during weathering. In general, pyrite and organic matter, if present, would be the first to react with oxygen during weathering (e.g. Wildman et al., 2004). It has been demonstrated that the partitioning of iron (Fe speciation) and redox-sensitive element patterns can be modified by oxidative weathering (e.g. Jaffe et al., 2002; Tuttle et al., 2009; Ahm et al., 2017; Gibson et al., 2020). The increased acidity due to pyrite and organic matter oxidation would further lead to dissolution of carbonate minerals, and\/or silicification of siltstones, and\/or precipitation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides, during which REE in the phosphate fraction may be lost and fractionated (Hough, 2004). Comparison of weathered and unweathered phosphorites from the Beetle Creek Formation in Duchess, Georgina Basin indicates that the REE abundance of the remaining phosphate fraction might be lowered during weathering (Hough, 2004). It also appears that some yttrium may also have been removed as weathered samples exhibited less pronounced Y\/Ho ratios (Hough, 2004). However, a recent study on phosphorites of the same formation from different regions of the Georgina Basin suggests that the REE contents of bulk rocks are instead slightly enriched in weathered phosphorites (Valetich et al., 2022). This is probably because of diminished dilution in the bulk rock by other less REE concentrated minerals\/phases as a result of organic matter, pyrite, and\/or carbonate removal during weathering. Hough (2004) also indicated that MREE and HREE are preferentially removed from the phosphate fraction with insignificant alteration of the Ce anomaly during weathering. Regardless, both weathered and unweathered phosphorites are characterized by a flattening or reversal of the typical HREE enrichment of seawater, which has previously been proposed to be indicative of weathering (Bonnot-Courtois and Flicoteaux, 1989) or diagenesis (Shields and Webb, 2004). There is no systematic difference in ErN\/LuN ratios between weathered and unweathered phosphorites, suggesting that HREE are removed congruently during weathering and that the inter-element fractionation from Er to Lu may not be indicative of weathering processes but characteristic of diagenetic modification (Hough, 2004; Shields and Webb, 2004; Valetich et al., 2022). Alternatively, HREE depletion in phosphorites has been interpreted to reflect REE source characteristics (e.g. Liu and Zhou, 2017).\nThe REE signatures of IFs are generally considered to be resistant to diagenesis and metamorphism due to low water\/rock ratios and closed-system conditions, whereas hydrothermal alteration and weathering may have a significant impact on the primary REE signals (Bau, 1993). In the absence of strong complexation ligands (e.g. CO3\n2\u2212, OH\u2212, F\u2212), hydrothermal alteration is usually characterized by enrichment of LREE and divalent Eu in the fluid due to their relatively large ionic radii (Bau and M\u00f6ller, 1992). The effect of weathering on REE mobility depends on water\/rock ratios, source-rock mineralogy, and chemistry of alteration fluids, and it is therefore hard to predict the variation of REE in a general sense (Bau, 1993). Notably, on the basis of La-Ce isotopic systematics, Hayashi et al. (2004) demonstrated that secondary alteration has introduced apparent negative Ce anomalies into the ca. 3.25\u00a0Ga IFs from the Barberton Greenstone Belt. More recently, Bonnand et al. (2020) reported that the pronounced negative Ce anomalies as low as 0.19, i.e. far less than modern-like values (<0.6), in the ca. 3.22\u00a0Ga IFs of the Barberton Greenstone Belt are likely derived from late-stage addition of REE from weathering related alteration fluids that are characterized by LREE enrichment and Ce depletion. It raises the cautionary tale that anomalous Ce anomalies in ancient IFs should be interpreted with caution, though little is known for certain regarding the underlying mechanisms for producing the extreme values. Given that REE geochemistry of IFs has contributed greatly to our understanding of Precambrian seawater chemistry (e.g. Bau and Dulski, 1996; Kato et al., 1998), especially for Archean and Paleoproterozoic times, the impact of secondary alteration, including weathering, on REE characteristics undoubtedly requires further investigation. It should be noted here that weathering may also impact REE patterns in shales, to which increasing attention has been paid in recent years (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2020), and this will be discussed in Section 5.2.2.\n\n\n2.2.3\nDetrital contamination\nDetrital contamination is another important factor affecting the preservation of primary marine REE patterns in geological records. This is because detrital minerals have much higher REE contents and completely different shale-normalized REE patterns (typically flat). It has been demonstrated that even a minor shale contamination (e.g. 1\u20132%) can significantly alter the primary REE signals of carbonates (Nothdurft et al., 2004), although such contamination sensitivity also depends on the original REE concentrations of pure carbonates. The detrital minerals can be weathered, transported, and ultimately co-deposited with sedimentary rocks. During diagenesis, the REE contents in the detritus can be released following their dissolution and transferred to authigenic mineral phases. Therefore, covariations between Al, Ti, Th, Sc, Rb, and total REE content (or Ce anomalies, Y\/Ho ratios) are usually considered in order to constrain the influence of detrital contamination (e.g. Kamber and Webb, 2001; Planavsky et al., 2010; Bellefroid et al., 2019). For those rocks that have been contaminated to different extents by detrital minerals, cut-off values using different elements can be invoked to screen for primary REE patterns (e.g. Ling et al., 2013). Overall, REE patterns in geological records can be complicated by secondary alteration, and demonstrably least altered rock samples are therefore preferred for analysis.\n\n\n2.2.4\nExtracting primary REE signals from geological records\nThe purity of rock samples can also impact upon the extraction of primary REE signals. While reliable REE patterns might be obtained by dissolving clean\/pure carbonate rocks with the strong acid (e.g. Webb and Kamber, 2000), non-target phases, such as Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides and detrital minerals, in impure carbonate rocks may be attacked by the strong acid, releasing their REE contents into solution and complicating the interpretation of REE patterns (e.g. Kamber et al., 2004; Nothdurft et al., 2004; Webb et al., 2009). In such cases, sequential leaching is recommended for REE phase separation with the aim of reducing any significant non-target phase contaminations, e.g. Zhang et al. (2015) based their approach around the trace metal partitioning protocol of Tessier et al. (1979). The underlying assumption of sequential leaching is that different geochemical or mineral phases in a rock can be separated by different reagents of defined strength. However, it should be mentioned that perfect separation may not be achievable in practice. Some trace metals associated with clay minerals may be released when leaching with dilute and weak acid attacks even if the clays are not dissolved (e.g. Li et al., 2019). Nevertheless, sequential leaching has been successfully applied to REE studies of carbonate rocks (e.g. Zhang et al., 2015; Tostevin et al., 2016a; Cao et al., 2020a), iron formations (e.g. Allwood et al., 2010; Oonk et al., 2018), and shales (e.g. Abanda and Hannigan, 2006; Phan et al., 2018). Sequential leaching has also advanced our understanding of the relative distributions of REE in different chemically defined portions of a rock, providing insights into the conditions under which different mineral phases formed. Moreover, sequential extraction has greatly improved the applicability of REE as a paleoredox tracer, thus adding nuance to our understanding of Earth's marine redox evolution (e.g. Zhang et al., 2018a; Bellefroid et al., 2018). Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has also been widely utilized to produce REE data in recent years (e.g. Baldwin et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2017; Oonk et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). The REE patterns obtained from LA-ICP-MS are generally comparable to those obtained through solution-based ICP-MS but are less smooth (e.g. Baldwin et al., 2011; Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, while LA-ICP-MS analyses are more likely to produce spiky\/irregular patterns as REE concentrations approach detection limits, solution-based ICP-MS has the advantage of matrix removal, leading to much lower detection limits (Baldwin et al., 2011). Regardless, laser ablation allows for in-situ microanalysis of minerals, which means that it can help identify potential contamination endmembers and screen data obtained through solution ICP-MS (e.g. Li et al., 2019). The in-situ analysis of LA-ICP-MS also makes it possible to extract primary marine REE signals from heterogeneous rocks and from rocks that have been diagenetically and\/or metamorphically altered. For example, Mloszewska et al. (2012) obtained seawater-like REE patterns from ca. 3.8\u00a0Ga metamorphosed IFs of the Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt with the help of LA-ICP-MS analysis. The technique also permits microscopic spatial variations to be traced that might relate to changes in the fluid medium over time. For example, it was found that phosphorite nodule cores can preserve more seawater-like REE patterns than the rims, which may continue scavenging REE from pore waters during growth (e.g. Zhu and Jiang, 2017; Lumiste et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nData compilation\nThis study compiled published REE data from globally distributed chemical sedimentary rocks and fine-grained mudstones (hereafter referred to as shales) of all ages, along with new analyses of REE of carbonate rocks, phosphorites, and shales from our own rock collection. For the REE data of chemical sedimentary rocks (i.e. carbonate rocks, iron formations, phosphorites, and cherts), we first collected 573 articles published since 1990. Because of the analytical limitations, some early articles did not report complete REE series data, especially for Y which is important for data screening (Section 3.2). Some articles did not report the raw data and\/or the detailed experimental methods, which reduces the data credibility. Some articles were also devoted to diagenetic studies or revealed the existence of strong detrital influence, in which case the REE patterns clearly do not represent primary signals. In addition, the REE patterns in some collected articles are evidently influenced by secondary alteration (e.g. strong MREE-arching). It is, therefore, necessary to remove those articles before data compilation. Finally, 6155 REE data points from 211 published articles and 51 data points from unpublished sources were compiled, in addition to 101 modern seawater REE data from 9 published articles (Supplementary Table S1). One may argue that the removal of articles containing MREE enriched patterns is arbitrary because such patterns may reflect the primary seawater REE chemistry (e.g. Hood and Wallace, 2015). However, we note that MREE-arching patterns randomly occur in chemical sediments through Earth history, implying multiple origins of such patterns. The relatively small numbers of data points (~390) characterized by MREE enrichment in the unused articles also suggest that it will not influence the results significantly.\nThis study compiled published REE data from globally distributed chemical sedimentary rocks and fine-grained mudstones (hereafter referred to as shales) of all ages, along with new analyses of REE of carbonate rocks, phosphorites, and shales from our own rock collection. For the REE data of chemical sedimentary rocks (i.e. carbonate rocks, iron formations, phosphorites, and cherts), we first collected 573 articles published since 1990. Because of the analytical limitations, some early articles did not report complete REE series data, especially for Y which is important for data screening (Section 3.2). Some articles did not report the raw data and\/or the detailed experimental methods, which reduces the data credibility. Some articles were also devoted to diagenetic studies or revealed the existence of strong detrital influence, in which case the REE patterns clearly do not represent primary signals. In addition, the REE patterns in some collected articles are evidently influenced by secondary alteration (e.g. strong MREE-arching). It is, therefore, necessary to remove those articles before data compilation. Finally, 6155 REE data points from 211 published articles and 51 data points from unpublished sources were compiled, in addition to 101 modern seawater REE data from 9 published articles (Supplementary Table S1).

However, we note that MREE-arching patterns randomly occur in chemical sediments through Earth history, implying multiple origins of such patterns. The relatively small numbers of data points (~390) characterized by MREE enrichment in the unused articles also suggest that it will not influence the results significantly.\nThe compiled REE data of chemical sedimentary rocks are derived from bulk rock, sequential leaching, and LA-ICP-MS analyses, and they are divided into four categories mainly according to their lithologies, including carbonate rocks, iron formations, phosphorites, and cherts (Table 1\n). Using published interpretations, we divided the depositional environments of the chemical sedimentary rock samples into the shallow and deep marine realms. Roughly, the shallow marine realm comprises the shelf environment, and the upper slope environment in some cases; the deep marine realm comprises the slope and basinal environments. It should be noted that as we do not know the exact depositional water depths of these rocks, dividing samples into shallow and deep provides only broad constraints. For example, samples deposited in an intrashelf basin, unless water depth was specified as being below the storm wave base, were classified as belonging to the shallow realm.\nThe REE data of shales were compiled with particular emphasis on filling data gaps that became apparent following the compilation of chemical sedimentary rocks. In total, 544 data points from 16 published articles and 48 data points from unpublished sources were compiled (Supplementary Table S1). Since the meaning of REE distributions in shales remains controversial (see discussion in Section 5.2), we did not classify depositional environments (i.e. shallow and deep) and did not screen the shale data for quality in this compilation (see following Section 3.2). A list of the compiled sedimentary rocks with basic information on the nature of the lithologies as well as the depositional environments are shown in Table 1.\nThe REE data of shales were compiled with particular emphasis on filling data gaps that became apparent following the compilation of chemical sedimentary rocks.

Normalisation of REE patterns not only removes the natural abundance variations but also helps to test the fidelity of chemical analyses and to eliminate questionable data (Bau et al., 2014). The post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) and North American Shale Composite (NASC) are the most commonly used normalisation standards in the literature. The Mud of Queensland (MUQ), average of recent alluvial sediments, is also used in some cases (e.g. Kamber et al., 2005; Planavsky et al., 2020). While PAAS represents an average of 23 shales from Australia (Nance and Taylor, 1976), NASC is a composite of 40 fine-grained sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks mainly from North America (Gromet et al., 1984). PAAS is generally preferred over NASC because of the clear information about each sample going into PAAS, whereas NASC bears the risk of incorporating aberrant materials (McLennan, 1994).\nThe normalisation effects on REE anomalies have long been considered (e.g. Gromet et al., 1984; Kamber et al., 2004; Bolhar et al., 2004, 2005, and summarized in Kamber et al., 2014). For example, seawater-like REE patterns may disappear when normalised to PAAS but re-appear when normalised to a local supply (Kamber et al., 2004). In this study, the compiled shale standard PAAS was chosen for normalisation because no local source can be representative of all the data collected worldwide. There are different estimated PAAS values (e.g. McLennan, 1989; Pourmand et al., 2012). Comparison of Ce anomalies calculated by the two PAAS estimations reveals insignificant differences (~8%). It has been proposed that the \u2018old\u2019 PAAS values may contain dubious Tm and Ho values (e.g. Kamber et al., 2005), but the equations for calculating the screening parameters and Ce anomaly do not use these two elements (Table 2 and Section 3.2.2), thus imposing negligible influence on the results.\nOn the other hand, comparison of Archean rocks with an average of post-Archean shales (PAAS) may not be ideal due to continental evolution (e.g. Gromet et al., 1984; Bolhar et al., 2004). The Archean upper crust may be characterized by relatively lower total REE and LREE contents, and an absence of or less pronounced Eu depletion as a consequence of less intensive intracrustal partial melting (e.g. Taylor and McLennan, 1981). Consequently, normalisation to PAAS may lead to overestimation of Eu anomalies and YbN\/PrN ratios in Archean chemical sedimentary rocks. Nevertheless, it should have little influence on the calculation of Ce anomaly because of the coherent behaviour of LREE (La-Nd) during intracrustal differentiation. There is no consensus on the average Archean crustal composition (e.g. Tang et al., 2016; Lipp et al., 2021). To illustrate the normalisation effects, we compared the Ce anomaly values of screened Archean rocks (see also subsequent sections) by normalising to PAAS (McLennan, 1989) and the Archean upper crust (estimated by Taylor and McLennan, 1981), respectively. The differences in Ce anomaly values between the two types of normalisation are within 5%, though the differences of Eu anomalies could be as large as 35%. Taken together, PAAS values of McLennan (1989) were used here to maintain consistency with most previous REE studies, and readers can easily compare their values with our results.\n\n\n3.2.2\nCe anomaly calculation\nThe Ce anomaly was conventionally calculated as an arithmetic mean between normalised La and Pr (e.g. De Baar et al., 1985), i.e. (Ce\/Ce*)\nN\n\u00a0=\u00a02CeN\/(LaN\u00a0+\u00a0PrN), but it has long been recognized that the anomalous La enrichment of seawater and chemical precipitates will produce apparent Ce anomalies (e.g. Bau and Dulski, 1996). One approach to discriminate the artificial Ce anomalies was to introduce the Pr anomaly, i.e. (Pr\/Pr*)N\u00a0=\u00a02PrN\/(CeN\u00a0+\u00a0NdN), whereby a genuine negative Ce anomaly will result in (Pr\/Pr*)\nN\n\u00a0>\u00a01 (Bau and Dulski, 1996). Nevertheless, Ce anomaly interpretations are complicated by the incorporation of La in the equation (Lawrence et al., 2006). Considering that normalised REE patterns are generally shown against a logarithmically scaled concentration axis, Lawrence and Kamber (2006) proposed a new equation to calculate the Ce anomaly, i.e. (Ce\/Ce*)N\u00a0=\u00a0CeN\/(PrN*PrN\/NdN). Due to the mathematical rationality and removal of La, this equation has become increasingly accepted among researchers (e.g. Zhang et al., 2015; Tostevin et al., 2016a; Wallace et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021).\nIt should be mentioned that the reliability of the new equation relies on precisely measured Pr and Nd concentrations. Although there is no chemical reason for the creation of a Nd and\/or a Pr anomaly, analytical artefacts can lead to Nd anomalies, thereby affecting Ce anomalies (Bau and Dulski, 1996; Bellefroid et al., 2018). On this basis, a parameter referred to as a Nd anomaly is introduced in this paper (Table 2). In addition, Ce analytical artefacts may arise during ICP-MS measurements. Because of its substantially higher concentration in marine sediments relative to other REE, the detector in the modern ICP-MS instrumentation may need to shift modes (between pulse-count and analog) when measuring calibration standards and samples, resulting in analytical uncertainties that can be as large as 10\u201315% (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2010; Stead et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018). Kamber et al. (2014) also noted that the shale normalised REE patterns of some Archean marine sediments may show a slight upswing among the LREE, which can lead to apparent positive Ce anomalies (about +10%) using the new equation. Therefore, a Ce anomaly value of 0.9\u20131.1 has only limited geological meaning as it can be caused either by analytical or normalisation artefacts (Kamber et al., 2014), but for continuity's sake, a negative Ce anomaly is still defined as any value <1 in this study.\n\n\n3.2.3\nScreening criteria\nAssuming that well-preserved chemical sedimentary rocks preserve primary marine signals, their REE patterns should broadly resemble modern seawater. As mentioned above (Section 2.1), the REE patterns of seawater in modern open oceans are mainly characterized by positive La and Gd anomalies, progressive HREE enrichment, and superchondritic Y\/Ho weight ratios. Although the magnitude of HREE enrichment and Y\/Ho ratios can be weakened in anoxic waters due to the reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides (Fig. 2), there is only seldom any reversal of typical seawater patterns (e.g. De Baar et al., 1988; Bau et al., 1997). Therefore, several parameters were invoked to help identify these features (Table 2), which are widely applied in the literature (e.g. Bolhar et al., 2005; Kamber et al., 2014; Tostevin et al., 2016a). The DyN\/SmN ratio was also introduced to constrain MREE enrichment, which can be a signature of diagenetic enrichment (Shields and Stille, 2001; Shields and Webb, 2004). Overall, a diverse range of criteria and respective cut-off values were used to screen the data (Table 2). We acknowledge that the cut-off values are somewhat arbitrary, and we may therefore lose some pristine REE values, but only on this basis can we attain the most reliable data possible. It should be mentioned that anomalous outliers still exist after data filtration (especially for the Archean Eon), which are likely indicative of secondary alteration (Bekker et al., 2014; Kamber et al., 2014; Bonnand et al., 2020). In this study, the outliers were removed if they randomly occur within a stratigraphic sequence, exhibit spiky REE patterns, contain abnormally high REE concentrations compared with similar lithologies, and\/or show evidence of isotopic alteration (e.g. La-Ce and\/or Sm-Nd). The dataset was then further evaluated by hypothetical mixing with potential contaminants (Section 5.1). In total, 1127 out of 6307 samples (including modern seawater) passed the screening, and the final screened dataset can be found in Supplementary Table S2.\nAssuming that well-preserved chemical sedimentary rocks preserve primary marine signals, their REE patterns should broadly resemble modern seawater.

In total, 1127 out of 6307 samples (including modern seawater) passed the screening, and the final screened dataset can be found in Supplementary Table S2.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nChemical sedimentary rocks\n\n4.1.1\nCarbonate rocks\nThe REE are retained in the calcite lattice by substituting for Ca2+ (Zhong and Mucci, 1995), and the REE partition coefficients between calcite and seawater are relatively high and uniform across those elements (Webb and Kamber, 2000). Therefore, Ce anomalies in carbonate rocks have been widely applied in paleoredox reconstruction. The Ce anomaly record of carbonate rocks spans the Archean through to modern times (Fig. 3a). Archean carbonate samples exhibit negligible Ce anomalies (mean 0.98) with the exception of the Mosher carbonates at Steep Rock Lake in Canada that have Ce anomalies as low as 0.71 (Riding et al., 2014; see also discussion in Section 5.3.1). Carbonate Ce anomalies begin to show considerable variability after 2.5\u00a0Ga, with a broadly decreasing trend, reaching modern-like negative Ce anomaly values (<0.6) at ca. 2.0\u00a0Ga. During the mid-Proterozoic (ca. 1.8\u20130.8\u00a0Ga), Ce anomalies range between 0.50 and 0.97 (mean 0.80) with sample ages mainly distributed between 1.6 and 1.2\u00a0Ga. Neoproterozoic carbonate samples exhibit a considerably greater range of Ce anomalies between 0.42 and 1.98 (mean 1.10). Specifically, Ce anomaly values reveal a gradually decreasing trend from Tonian (mean 1.28), to Cryogenian (mean 1.19), through Ediacaran (mean 1.08) carbonates, whereby modern-like negative Ce anomaly values (<0.6) are not uncommon in Ediacaran samples. Whereas shallow marine carbonate samples (i.e. mainly from the shelf environment) of Proterozoic age show a wide range of Ce anomalies, with both negative and positive values, deep marine carbonate samples (i.e. slope to basin environment) mostly have positive Ce anomalies. By contrast, Phanerozoic samples (including modern seawater) mainly exhibit negative Ce anomalies with a mean value of 0.70 in the early Paleozoic (Cambrian to early Devonian) and a mean value of 0.57 in post-early Devonian samples. Phanerozoic deep marine carbonate samples also show negative Ce anomalies. Ce anomalies above 1.0 only rarely occur in Phanerozoic carbonate samples, possibly due to ocean anoxic events, such as near the Permian\/Triassic boundary (e.g. Loope et al., 2013).\n\n\n4.1.2\nIron formations\nIron formations are iron-rich (>15\u00a0wt%) chemical sedimentary rocks deposited mainly between ca. 3.0 and 1.8\u00a0Ga, and only sporadically later on, with one notable event at around 0.7\u00a0Ga associated with widespread glaciation (Bekker et al., 2010). It is accepted that IFs can preserve the chemical signature of ancient seawater because they are not generally contaminated by detrital minerals and their precursor minerals (e.g. silica-associated Fe (III)-oxyhydroxides) precipitated directly from seawater (Bekker et al., 2014; Konhauser et al., 2017). With this in mind, the REE patterns of IFs have been intensively studied to unravel Precambrian ocean chemistry (e.g. Bau and Dulski, 1996; Bolhar et al., 2005; Planavsky et al., 2010). The interpretation of REE in IFs rests on the assumption that minimal fractionation occurs during the adsorption of REE onto Fe (III)-oxyhydroxides and that IFs tend to preserve the REE signature of seawater at the site of ferric iron precipitation (Bekker et al., 2014). As shown in Fig. 3b, the IFs show negligible Ce anomalies with an average of 1.08 before 3.0\u00a0Ga, but seem to exhibit a slightly greater range of Ce anomalies, between 0.85 and 1.38 (mean 1.08), during 3.0\u20132.5\u00a0Ga. It should be noted that normalisation and analytical artefacts can lead to apparent Ce anomalies (Section 3.2). By comparing the data obtained by different techniques from similar age IFs, it seems that the data from LA-ICP-MS (RSD ~9%) exhibit greater variability than those from solution ICP-MS (RSD ~5%), possibly because the latter can remove the matrix by the volatilization of SiF4 through careful sample preparation (e.g. Baldwin et al., 2011). The Ce anomalies of Paleoproterozoic IFs lie in the range of 0.83\u20131.37 (mean 1.02), but there appears to be no significant difference in mean values between shallow and deep Paleoproterozoic IFs. Neoproterozoic IFs exhibit Ce anomalies ranging between 0.53 and 1.18 (mean 0.83). Specifically, the Ce anomalies of IFs associated with the early Cryogenian \u2018Sturtian\u2019 glaciation range between 0.83 and 1.18 (average 1.03), while those in the mid-Ediacaran exhibit Ce anomalies of 0.53\u20130.91 (mean 0.64).\n\n\n4.1.3\nPhosphorites\nDuring the precipitation of phosphorites near the sediment-water interface, REE are incorporated into the apatite structure mainly by substituting for Ca2+, and consequently, the REE characteristics of phosphorites may reflect the REE signature of ambient seawater and\/or pore water (McArthur and Walsh, 1984; Shields and Stille, 2001; Jiang et al., 2007). As shown in Fig. 3c, most Precambrian phosphorite REE data have been screened out due to high SmN\/YbN ratios, with only several Ediacaran phosphorites showing positive Ce anomalies (1.03\u20131.15, mean 1.10) being retained. Nevertheless, the negative Ce anomalies in ca. 2.0\u00a0Ga phosphorites (Zaonega Formation in Russia; Joosu et al., 2015) and ca. 0.58\u00a0Ga phosphorites (Doushantuo Formation at Weng'an in South China; Shields et al., 2004) have been proposed to be indicative of oxic conditions during early diagenesis, despite the strong MREE enrichment. Phosphorite deposits are relatively common in the Phanerozoic. Overall, the Ce anomalies of Phanerozoic phosphorites sit in the range of 0.13\u20130.91 with a mean value of 0.46. Specifically, Carboniferous phosphorites display the most negative Ce anomalies as low as 0.13.\n\n\n4.1.4\nCherts\nThe cherts, although volumetrically minor in geological records, are common in key stratigraphic intervals, and therefore, have been investigated to provide information about paleo-ocean chemistry (Murray, 1994). Due to the evolution of silica-secreting organisms such as radiolaria, diatoms, and siliceous sponges, silica is commonly biogenic in Phanerozoic cherts, while Precambrian cherts were instead precipitated abiotically in a range of environments from the deep seafloor to restricted evaporitic settings (Siever, 1992; Maliva et al., 2005). The Ce anomalies for cherts before 2.5\u00a0Ga range between 0.88 and 1.22 with a mean value of 1.05. Late Ediacaran cherts mainly display negative Ce anomalies ranging between 0.38 and 0.68 (average 0.57), while during the Phanerozoic, Ce anomalies are in the range of 0.21\u20131.09 with a mean value of 0.64 for Paleozoic cherts (Fig. 3d).\n\n\n\n4.2\nShales\nThe Ce anomaly records of shales focus on the data gaps evident in the compilation of chemical sedimentary rocks, and shale REE data have not been screened as described above. Perhaps surprisingly, the compiled Ce anomalies of shales display considerable variation, ranging between 0.19 and 1.81 (average 0.87; Fig. 3e). The Ce anomalies in shales have an average value of 0.87 during 1.40\u20130.75\u00a0Ga. Notably, the Shennongjia Group retains modern seawater-like REE patterns and significant negative Ce anomaly values as low as 0.37 (Canfield et al., 2018), which is the lowest value from the Mesoproterozoic Era in our compilation (including values of chemical sedimentary rocks). Tonian shales also display pronounced negative Ce anomalies as low as 0.49, which is significantly lower than that of chemical sedimentary rocks deposited later during the Cryogenian Period. The lowest Ce anomaly value in shales in our compilation is 0.19 reported from the Carboniferous Lisburne Group by Dumoulin et al. (2011). However, what phase or phases host the negative Ce anomalies in these shales and whether the negative Ce anomalies in shales are indicative of oxic conditions in contemporaneous seawater remains controversial, and this is further discussed in the following section.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nData evaluation\nAlthough it is commonly accepted that REE patterns in sedimentary rocks resist secondary alteration, post-depositional mobilization of REE and distortion of Ce anomalies have been demonstrated (e.g. Webb et al., 2009; Hood et al., 2018; Bonnand et al., 2020). It is, therefore, important to evaluate the data fidelity. Geochemical parameters including Mn\/Sr, Fe\/Sr, Sr\/Ca, \u03b418O, and 87Sr\/86Sr are commonly invoked to evaluate the extent of alteration (Brand and Veizer, 1980). However, due to the differences in elemental partition coefficients between minerals and fluids and the concentration differences in diagenetic fluids, alteration of these common geochemical indicators does not necessarily imply that trace elements such as REE have also been altered. The fidelity of REE data and Ce anomalies is best assessed by the REE pattern itself with secondary alteration generally accompanied by distortion of a seawater-like REE pattern (e.g. Shields and Stille, 2001; Webb et al., 2009; Bonnand et al., 2020; Tostevin, 2021). Binary mixing models are helpful to discern potential alteration and contamination trends using hypothetical endmembers, and such models have been widely applied in the literature (e.g. Van Kranendonk et al., 2003; Kamber and Webb, 2001; Kamber et al., 2004; Della Porta et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019). To test whether filtered data are significantly biased towards altered patterns and values, we constructed mixing curves for different rock lithologies (Fig. 4\n). The representative samples of different lithologies (assuming pure endmembers) were selected from filtered data (Fig. 4), which show smooth and very seawater-like REE patterns and low REE contents. Given their high REE concentrations, silicates, phosphorites, and Fe-Mn oxides are three major potential contamination endmembers, which can modify primary REE patterns either during diagenesis or sample digestion. While PAAS (McLennan, 1989) was chosen to represent the silicate endmember, an early Cambrian phosphorite (sample Ix40; Shields and Stille, 2001) defines the end diagenetic member. Since the exact diagenetic influences of Fe-Mn oxides remain unclear, two kinds of Fe-Mn deposits (diagenetic Fe-Mn nodules and hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts) were chosen as representative endmembers (data from Bau et al., 2014).\nAs shown in Fig. 4a, for carbonate rocks, most of the samples deviate from the mixing curves in the cross plot of \u2211REE with Y\/Ho, but some samples, especially those with high REE concentrations, seem to follow modelled trends for silicate and\/or phosphorite contamination, implying admixture of as much as 15%. However, the hypothetical mixing lines between silicate\/phosphorite and carbonate fail to account for variation in PrN\/YbN and DyN\/SmN (Fig. 4b, c), indicating contamination of typically less than 1%. Therefore, those carbonate rock samples containing high REE contents as well as moderate-to-high Y\/Ho ratios (>40) may either imply an unknown diagenetic endmember characterized by high total REE concentrations, high Y\/Ho and DyN\/SmN ratios, and low PrN\/YbN ratios, or reflect more efficient REE uptake from seawater (e.g. Van Kranendonk et al., 2003), or indicate inheritance of seawater-like REE patterns from dissolution of other carbonate rocks during early diagenesis (e.g. Webb et al., 2009). Potential candidates for the diagenetic endmember might be late-stage diagenetic cements (e.g. saddle dolomite, thermochemical sulfate reduction-related calcite), which have relatively high REE contents, but they are generally LREE enriched. Major influence from thermochemical sulfate reduction is deemed unlikely for most Precambrian rocks as this would normally require the improbable co-existence of petroleum and sulfate. Considering the consistent La and Gd anomalies, efficient REE uptake from seawater and\/or inheritance of seawater-like REE patterns during early diagenesis might be more conceivable.\nSimilarly, for iron formations, the variation of \u2211REE and Y\/Ho in some samples follows the binary mixing of silicate and phosphorite endmembers, while contamination from Fe-Mn oxides is suggested to be typically less than 1\u20133% (Fig. 4d). Although significant phosphorite contamination can be ruled out due to its inconsistency with the variation in PrN\/YbN, silicate contamination seems to have affected some samples by as much as 15% (Fig. 4d-f). This is possibly due to the use of acids (e.g. HNO3, HCl and HF) during sample digestion, which can also attack detrital minerals. Therefore, we removed those samples that have been modified more than 5% as indicated by the binary mixing curve with silicate. The final screened dataset that is used for statistical analysis (Section 5.3) can be found in Supplementary Table S2. On the other hand, most of the phosphorite and chert samples deviate from the mixing curves that also fail to explain simultaneous Y\/Ho, PrN\/YbN and DyN\/SmN variability. Taken together, it suggests that the data filtered through multiple parameters have not been significantly altered, and that the screening strategy employed here may be helpful to discern seawater-like Ce anomalies in chemical sedimentary rocks.\nSimilarly, for iron formations, the variation of \u2211REE and Y\/Ho in some samples follows the binary mixing of silicate and phosphorite endmembers, while contamination from Fe-Mn oxides is suggested to be typically less than 1\u20133% (Fig. 4d).

Slight deviation from the typical bulk shale REE pattern also exists, and this is not surprising given the heterogeneous mineral assemblage of shales. However, REE patterns of shales may deviate significantly due to both sedimentary and post-depositional processes. For example, it has been proposed that REE scavenging particles can be transported to the seafloor and if deposited with shales may lead to LREE enrichment (e.g. Della Porta et al., 2015). Shale REE may also be fractionated during weathering (e.g. Abanda and Hannigan, 2007). Additionally, authigenic phases in shales (e.g. carbonate, sulfide, silica, phosphate, and organic matter) may lead to atypical REE patterns, but the extent and nature of such deviation is hard to predict (e.g. Lev and Filer, 2004; Turner and Kamber, 2012; Canfield et al., 2018). Of the atypical REE patterns, the Ce anomaly could be the most intriguing character because of its role in shaping our view of Earth's redox evolution. Nevertheless, the meaning of Ce anomalies in shales remains contentious, and is briefly discussed in the following.\n\n5.2.1\nDiagenetic effects on REE patterns\nIn general, REE in shales would be considered immobile, but REE redistribution could occur during diagenesis under open system conditions (Lev and Filer, 2004; Lev et al., 2008). It has been proposed that such redistribution is related to the formation and dissolution of authigenic minerals (e.g. carbonate, apatite, and monazite), whereby whole-rock Ce anomalies in black shales could be changed by as much as 20% (Lev et al., 1998, 1999). Kidder et al. (2003) also demonstrated that phosphorites forming during early diagenesis preferentially scavenge MREE leading to MREE depletion in the host shales. Therefore, diagenetic processes can alter REE patterns of shales, particularly for phosphatic shales.\n\n\n5.2.2\nCould recent weathering produce significant negative Ce anomalies in shales?\nTrace element mobility during weathering has long been documented in different lithologies (e.g. Cotten et al., 1995; Morey and Setterholm, 1997; Patino et al., 2003; V\u00e1zquez-Ortega et al., 2015). It has been shown that spheroidal weathering of basalts and andesites can produce significant negative Ce anomalies (as low as 0.35) and high REE contents in corestones (Patino et al., 2003). This has been attributed to transportation of Ce depleted weathering solution from exfoliated shells to corestones. The REE behaviour during shale weathering remains inconclusive and may also be controlled by water\/rock ratios, source-rock mineralogy, and chemistry of alteration fluids, but there are clear differences between heavily weathered shales (i.e. now as soils that retain less or no parent rock structure) and slightly to moderately weathered shales.\nSignificant positive Ce anomalies in regolith soils have been observed at the Susquehanna\/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, USA (Ma et al., 2011). This has been interpreted as preferential precipitation of Ce under oxidative weathering conditions, while the concurrent REE depletion in soils is attributed to re-adsorption of the mobilized REE onto secondary minerals (e.g. kaolinite, Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides) that are then lost to soil water. Significant negative Ce anomalies have also been observed in soils at depth in Alabama, USA (Jin et al., 2017). The mobilized REE in shallow soils can precipitate out at depth possibly due to the increase of pH and ionic strength, and decrease of dissolved organic matter concentration in pore waters (Ma et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2017). Consequently, significant negative Ce anomalies can be imparted into deep soils as a result of Ce scavenging in the shallow layer. These studies demonstrate the mobility of shale REE, especially for Ce, in heavily weathered soil profiles. Nevertheless, the parent illite-rich shales (i.e. less or unweathered rocks) show typically flat PAAS-normalized REE patterns (e.g. Ma et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2017), suggesting negligible influence of soil fluids possibly due to the ultra-low porosity and permeability of parent shales. Furthermore, the intrinsic heterogeneity of shales may hinder the interpretation of the exact influence of weathering on REE patterns solely based on vertical soil profiles. Comparison of fresh core samples and their counterpart outcrop samples reveals that the LREE remain largely intact in spite of modest removal of MREE and HREE in moderately weathered Wufeng-Longmaxi organic-rich black shales (Tang et al., 2018; Fig. 5\n). This is corroborated by weathering experiments in organic-rich Utica shales, in which MREE and HREE are preferentially removed when leaching with acidic (pH\u00a05) solutions (Abanda and Hannigan, 2007). Congruent removal of LREE has also been observed along a moderately weathered black shale bed in Poland, with negligible influence on the magnitude of Ce anomalies (Marynowski et al., 2017; Fig. 5). Taken together, we consider that although weathering can produce significant positive and\/or negative Ce anomalies in soils, significant changes to REE patterns are unlikely in slightly to moderately weathered shales.\nOn this basis, it is interesting to note the study on vertical weathered profiles of the Lower Cambrian Shuijingtuo black shales in Chongqing, South China (Ling et al., 2015). The parent black shales from three different profiles, when normalised to PAAS, all exhibit seawater-like REE patterns characterized by HREE enrichment, Y enrichment and negative Ce anomalies. The REE patterns of regolith soils from different profiles reveal different weathering trends. For example, the Ce anomaly value in the regolith is higher by 46% compared to the parent shale in profile C (Fig. 5; Ling et al., 2015), while it is lower by 24% in profile B. The Y\/Ho and YbN\/PrN ratios are also lower by 25% and 33%, respectively, in the regolith of profile C (Fig. 5; Ling et al., 2015). The discrepancy in REE patterns between parent shales and regolith soils may reflect either the shale heterogeneity or effect of weathering (Ling et al., 2015). The significant depletion of calcite and dolomite contents (also CaO and MgO concentrations) in regolith soils with respect to parent black shales indicates their preferential removal under acidic conditions induced by pyrite and organic matter oxidation during weathering (Wu et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the parent shales, as discussed above, seem to have resisted any influence from modern oxidative weathering. Considering the generally low phosphate contents in those black shales (Wu et al., 2016), their REE patterns are also unlikely to have been altered by phosphate diagenesis (Kidder et al., 2003). Therefore, we consider that negative Ce anomalies could be primary features of shales.\n\n\n5.2.3\nWhat is the meaning of negative Ce anomalies in shales?\nNegative Ce anomalies have been reported in shales deposited under suboxic-anoxic-euxinic conditions (e.g. Slack et al., 2004; Dumoulin et al., 2011; Pi et al., 2013; Cox et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Planavsky et al., 2018; Phan et al., 2018; Canfield et al., 2018), which seems counterintuitive at first glance since negative Ce anomalies are generally presumed to indicate oxic conditions. Although Ce depletion is thought to occur in oxic waters only, there are exceptions. German and Elderfield (1989) found slightly negative Ce anomalies in suboxic to anoxic waters in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia. A recent study by Adebayo et al. (2020) reported pronounced negative Ce anomalies in highly euxinic bottom waters from the Pettaquamscutt River estuary. They suggest that the Ce depletion is inherited from source waters including stream water, groundwater, and pore water, all of which display negative Ce anomalies. However, whether their research based on the estuarine environment is applicable to other environments needs further investigation. Recently, Canfield et al. (2018) reported pronounced negative Ce anomalies from ca. 1.4\u00a0Ga organic-rich black shales in the Shennongjia Group in South China, which have been disputed by Planavsky et al. (2020) who proposed that negative Ce anomalies in shales signal alteration by oxidative weathering. However, as discussed above, it is suggested here that, although weathering can alter the bulk shale REE pattern, negative Ce anomalies are more likely to be primary signatures, potentially related to organic matter, making them an unreliable criterion for shale alteration (discussed further below).\nNegative Ce anomalies retained in bulk shales have been attributed to the formation of syndepositional phosphorites based on robust covariation between P2O5 contents and Ce anomalies (Slack et al., 2004, 2015; Dumoulin et al., 2011). For instance, pronounced negative Ce anomalies and seawater-like REE patterns have been found in metalliferous black shales interbedded with phosphorites of the Carboniferous Lisburne Group (Dumoulin et al., 2011). The significant negative Ce anomalies were thought to reflect phosphate deposition from seawater that was greatly depleted in Ce due to the oxygenation of atmosphere and oceans as a consequence of the evolution of vascular land plants and concomitant organic carbon burial (Dumoulin et al., 2011). Even so, it is also likely that the phosphorites sequestered REE from authigenic phases within shales (e.g. organic matter) during formation under suboxic-anoxic early diagenetic conditions (e.g. Kidder et al., 2003), given the similar REE patterns of black shales and phosphorites (Dumoulin et al., 2011).\nSome researchers hypothesize that negative Ce anomalies are associated with organic matter in shales (e.g. Pi et al., 2013), and several lines of evidence suggest an intimate relationship between organic matter and Ce anomalies. For example, negative Ce anomalies in the Velkerri Formation deposited under anoxic-euxinic conditions are constrained to samples with TOC\u00a0>\u00a02% (Cox et al., 2016). In the compilation reported in Planavsky et al. (2020) (their Fig. 3), negative Ce anomalies more commonly occur in fine-grained clastic sedimentary samples with high TOC and low Al contents (especially for the drill core samples). It has been proposed that kerogen could retain the REE signature of shallow seawater, the assumption being that the organic matter is mainly derived from plankton once living in the shallow photic zone (Guo et al., 2016). Specifically, Pi et al. (2013) and Guo et al. (2016) obtained REE patterns of kerogen in the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation, mostly from organic-rich black shales, which display pronounced negative Ce anomalies. Negative Ce anomalies and seawater-like REE patterns have also been found in the organic matter fraction of Devonian Woodford black shales in the Anadarko Basin (Ramirez-Caro, 2013). Moreover, REE contents in kerogen are usually high. For example, Phan et al. (2018) estimated that the organic matter in the Marcellus Shale contains REE in a range of 600 to 1000\u00a0ppm; Pi et al. (2013) reported REE concentrations up to 500\u00a0ppm from the kerogen of Niutitang black shales; and up to tens of thousands ppm of REE has been reported from Proterozoic stratiform kerogen (Mossman et al., 1993). Given the high amounts of REE in organic matter, it is reasonable to suggest that organic matter may exert a key control on REE cycling during early diagenesis and potentially also phosphogenesis, as well as causing observed deviations in REE patterns in bulk shale samples from average shale.\n\nPhan et al. (2018) addressed this question by conducting comprehensive isotopic and trace elemental analyses on sequentially leached fractions and whole rocks of core samples from the Middle Devonian Marcellus Formation, which was deposited under anoxic-euxinic conditions. Those samples are rich in organic matter and poor in carbonates. Phan et al. (2018) showed that the whole rock REE patterns exhibited genuine negative Ce anomalies that had not been modified by post-depositional processes. Significantly, phosphate content in those samples is low (<0.3%), shows no covariation with bulk REE content, and so had only negligible influence on the measured Ce anomalies (Kidder et al., 2003). The REE content in carbonate is proposed to inherit from organic matter during diagenesis given their similar REE patterns and U isotope values. Taken together, the negative Ce anomalies seem likely to be associated with organic matter in the Marcellus Formation (Phan et al., 2018).\n\n\n5.2.4\nFactors influencing organic matter REE patterns\nInstead of displaying negative Ce anomalies only, reported REE patterns of organic matter show various shapes (e.g. LREE enriched, MREE enriched, concave, flat) with different kinds of Ce anomaly (negative, positive, no-anomaly) (e.g. Felitsyn and Morad, 2002; Pi et al., 2013; Ramirez-Caro, 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2018). The underlying mechanism for these phenomena, however, is poorly understood. One possible explanation is that organic matter sourced from different organisms might comprise different REE patterns and Ce anomalies. It has been proposed that Ce anomalies in modern marine organisms are related to their surrounding redox conditions (Felitsyn et al., 1998; Felitsyn and Morad, 2002). In addition, REE patterns in organic matter might vary with species. Seawater-like REE patterns and pronounced negative Ce anomalies have been obtained from Sargassum hemiphyllum in Niigata Prefecture, Japan (Sakamoto et al., 2008). In the Mediterranean Sea, both MREE enriched patterns with negative Ce anomalies and LREE enriched patterns without Ce anomalies have been reported (Strady et al., 2015; Squadrone et al., 2017). Different functional groups at cell surfaces might lead to varied REE patterns in different organisms. For example, phosphate (e.g. phosphomonoester and phosphodiester) preferentially complexes with HREE at bacterial cell surfaces (Takahashi et al., 2010). The active uptake of REE by bacteria has also been documented given their occurrence in the active site of the XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium (e.g. Picone and Op den Camp, 2019), and those organisms are thought to selectively absorb LREE (Meyer et al., 2021). Although our knowledge of REE in biological systems is in its infancy, we might expect to see a range of REE patterns in organic matter with different sources.\nREE fractionation during diagenesis might contribute to the various REE patterns in organic matter. The REE released from degraded organic matter during early diagenesis may be re-adsorbed by remaining organic matter. The adsorptive scavenging inherently reflects the stability discrepancy between solution and surface complexations (Byrne and Kim, 1990; Schijf et al., 2015). Therefore, the REE fractionation during the readsorption depends on the organic ligands in organic matter. The stability constants for REE complexation with strong organic ligands generally show an overall increasing trend with atomic number (e.g. Byrne and Li, 1995), whereas laboratory experiments suggest that humic and fulvic acids preferentially complex with MREE (e.g. Pourret et al., 2007a; Tang and Johannesson, 2010). The REE fractionation also depends on the pore water pH and the concentrations of competing complexation ions (e.g. CO3\n2\u2212; Pourret et al., 2007b). On the other hand, cleavage of side chains and loss of functional groups (e.g. COOH and OH) during the thermal maturation of organic matter (i.e. catagenesis and\/or metagenesis) would, theoretically, release bonded REE. Felitsyn and Morad (2002) suggested that MREE are preferentially lost along with humic acids during thermal maturation, thus producing a concave shape of REE in the residual organic matter. It has also been proposed that LREE are mobilized with increasing thermal maturity, thus impacting Nd isotopic compositions of organic matter and whole rocks (Chakrabarti et al., 2007; Ramirez-Caro, 2013). A closed-system hydrous pyrolysis experiment on the organic-rich New Albany Shale further illustrates that LREE might be redistributed among different minerals (Clauer et al., 2006). However, there is evidence supporting the opposite. Organic matter REE patterns of the Utica Shale with different thermal maturities do not show significant difference (Abanda and Hannigan, 2006), suggesting little influence of thermal maturation on organic matter REE patterns. Overall, the behaviour of REE in organic matter during diagenesis remains inconclusive.\nIt is also possible that REE addition\/loss during sample preparation and digestion could give rise to various REE patterns in organic matter. Organic matter, in general, is isolated from rocks by sequentially leaching different components of the rock through physicochemical methods, and organic matter digestion is completed through oxidation either by an oxidizing acid or by ashing (e.g. Pi et al., 2013; Phan et al., 2018). A combination of HCl, HF, and HNO3 is commonly used to remove inorganic phases (e.g. carbonate, sulfide, phosphate, and silicate), but these acids have been proposed to attack functional groups or organic molecules (e.g. porphyrin, polysaccharide, amino acid) and to oxidize organic matter slowly (Saxby, 1970), leading to REE loss and potential REE fractionation in organic matter. Incomplete separation of inorganic phases might result in REE addition from other minerals, which can alter organic matter REE patterns as well (Felitsyn and Morad, 2002). The artefacts associated with sequential leaching may also lead to REE addition in organic matter. It has been proposed that trace elements released from specific phases through sequential leaching can be re-adsorbed onto sediments (Rendell et al., 1980), and Sholkovitz (1989) demonstrated poor REE recovery and re-adsorption of REE onto sediments at low pH (1.1\u20132.1) conditions. Tang and Johannesson (2003) suggested that REE are mainly complexed with organic matter in circumneutral and organic-rich acidic terrestrial waters. Therefore, part of REE released from inorganic phases during sequential leaching might also be re-adsorbed onto organic matter. The potential fractionation of REE related to the re-adsorption and subsequent effect on REE pattern interpretation are, however, poorly constrained and need further investigation.\n\n\n5.2.5\nCase study: negative Ce anomalies in the Member IV\/Miaohe shales, Doushantuo Formation\nThe Miaohe Member and correlative strata of Member IV of the Doushantuo Formation, dominated by organic-rich black and\/or siliceous shales, were deposited at ca. 570\u2013560\u00a0Ma, and are best known from the Yangtze Gorges region of South China (e.g. Xiao et al., 2017; Bridger et al., 2021). Previous studies have shown that the Miaohe\/Member IV exhibits considerable variability in quartz content (32\u201388%) with varying clay content (6\u201329%) which is dominated by illite and mixed-layer illite\/smectite (e.g. Bristow et al., 2009; Ai et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020, 2021), reflecting different degrees of silicification. The shales analysed in this study were collected from the Miaohe, Jiuqunao, and Jiulongwan sections located in the western and central region of the Huangling anticline in the Yangtze Gorges area. While the Member IV at Jiulongwan is dominated by black shales with carbonate concretions, the stratigraphically equivalent unit at Jiuqunao and Miaohe has been silicified to varying degrees (e.g. Xiao et al., 2017). Specifically, the Miaohe shales at the Miaohe section are strongly indurated, possibly indicating significant silicification (see Bridger et al. (2021) for detailed sample description). The Miaohe shales at the Miaohe section also contain well-preserved carbonaceous compressions in its lower part, which have been interpreted as fossil algae and putative metazoans (e.g. Xiao et al., 2002). Numerous studies have investigated the redox conditions during deposition of Member IV\/Miaohe shales. While RSE enrichment and \u03b4238U and \u03b498Mo isotopic data suggest a widespread ocean oxygenation event (e.g. Kendall et al., 2015; Sahoo et al., 2016; Ostrander et al., 2019), they also, together with iron speciation data, indicate locally anoxic-euxinic conditions during their deposition (e.g. Li et al., 2015; Bridger et al., 2021).\nThe bulk shale samples were crushed to powders for analysis. For major element analysis, ~0.1\u00a0g sample powder was mixed with ~0.4\u00a0g lithium metaborate flux in a platinum crucible and then fused in a muffle furnace at 1100\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The resulting melt was cooled, dissolved in ~50\u00a0ml 10% HNO3, and shaken constantly for 24\u00a0h. The solution was then filtered via a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filter and diluted 10 times for major element analysis using a Varian 720 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer at University College London. For trace and rare earth element analysis, ~60\u00a0mg samples were firstly dissolved in 3\u00a0ml HF and 2\u00a0ml HNO3, then in 2\u00a0ml HF, 1\u00a0ml HNO3 and 2\u00a0ml HClO4, and finally in 1\u00a0ml HNO3 and 1\u00a0ml HClO4. Samples were evaporated after each dissolution step before finally being dissolved in 2% HNO3. In addition, the bulk Miaohe shale samples were sequentially treated with nitric acid, then nitric acid after ashing, followed by multi-acid digestion (HF, HNO3, and HClO4). The supernatants after each sequential leaching step were dried and re-dissolved in 2% HNO3. The three sequential leachates are here operationally defined as \u2018carbonate\/oxide fraction\u2019, \u2018organic matter fraction\u2019, and \u2018silicate fraction\u2019, respectively (Fig. 6\n). Trace element concentrations including REE were measured from diluted solutions using a Bruker M90 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) at the London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London.\nThe Miaohe samples from the Miaohe section are significantly enriched in SiO2 (83.6\u201398.4%, mean 93.7%) and depleted in other major elements, e.g. Al2O3 (mean 3.0%), CaO (mean 0.1%), MgO (mean 0.2%), P2O5 (mean 0.05%) and FeO (mean 0.7%). Therefore, the Miaohe samples can reasonably be regarded as siliceous shales. On the other hand, the samples from the lower part of Jiuqunao section contain high contents of CaO (mean 20.7%) and MgO (19.8%) in addition to moderate SiO2 (mean 49.1%) and low Al2O3 (mean 4.6%) contents. These samples are thus referred to as dolomitic shales. Except for the lower part, the other samples from the Jiuqunao section are enriched in SiO2 (mean 91.1%) and depleted in other major elements (see Supplementary Table S3 for major element data), and are regarded as siliceous shales. The bulk shales exhibit seawater-like REE patterns with significant negative Ce anomalies, especially for those containing lower REE contents (e.g. Miaohe section; Fig. 6). The generally low REE abundances of these shales are anomalous. In this regard, it should be recalled that the Member IV\/Miaohe shales on the Yangtze platform underwent silicification, as also evidenced by very high SiO2 contents in our samples, which would tend to dilute typically shale-related elements (Murray, 1994). For siliceous shales from Jiuqunao and Miaohe sections, the SiO2 contents exhibit significant negative covariations with Al2O3 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.98), TiO2 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.97) and REE contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.89), which is consistent with dilution by silica (Fig. 7). This also supports previous inferences (e.g. Murray, 1994) that Al, Ti and REE are not significantly fractionated during silicification. Therefore, the generally low and variable REE contents in most of our samples likely reflect different degrees of silicification and related dilution. Interestingly, the dolomitic shales also contain low REE contents but have no significant relationship with SiO2 contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.29; Fig. 7). Instead, their REE contents covary negatively with (CaO\u00a0+\u00a0MgO) contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.51) and positively with Al2O3 contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.78). This suggests that the REE contents of dolomitic shales at Jiuqunao are likely controlled by both clay minerals and authigenic carbonates, and their low REE concentrations probably reflect the dilution of carbonates, as is the case for dolomitic shales in the Arctic Bay Formation (Turner and Kamber, 2012).\nThe Miaohe samples from the Miaohe section are significantly enriched in SiO2 (83.6\u201398.4%, mean 93.7%) and depleted in other major elements, e.g. Al2O3 (mean 3.0%), CaO (mean 0.1%), MgO (mean 0.2%), P2O5 (mean 0.05%) and FeO (mean 0.7%). Therefore, the Miaohe samples can reasonably be regarded as siliceous shales. On the other hand, the samples from the lower part of Jiuqunao section contain high contents of CaO (mean 20.7%) and MgO (mean 19.8%) in addition to moderate SiO2 (mean 49.1%) and low Al2O3 (mean 4.6%) contents. These samples are thus referred to as dolomitic shales. Except for the lower part, the other samples from the Jiuqunao section are enriched in SiO2 (mean 91.1%) and depleted in other major elements (see Supplementary Table S3 for major element data), and are regarded as siliceous shales. The bulk shales exhibit seawater-like REE patterns with significant negative Ce anomalies, especially for those containing lower REE contents (e.g. Miaohe section; Fig. 6). The generally low REE abundances of these shales are anomalous. In this regard, it should be recalled that the Member IV\/Miaohe shales on the Yangtze platform underwent silicification, as also evidenced by very high SiO2 contents in our samples, which would tend to dilute typically shale-related elements (Murray, 1994). For siliceous shales from Jiuqunao and Miaohe sections, the SiO2 contents exhibit significant negative covariations with Al2O3 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.98), TiO2 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.97) and REE contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.89), which is consistent with dilution by silica (Fig. 7). This also supports previous inferences (e.g. Murray, 1994) that Al, Ti and REE are not significantly fractionated during silicification. Therefore, the generally low and variable REE contents in most of our samples likely reflect different degrees of silicification and related dilution. Interestingly, the dolomitic shales also contain low REE contents but have no significant relationship with SiO2 contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.29; Fig. 7). Instead, their REE contents covary negatively with (CaO\u00a0+\u00a0MgO) contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.51) and positively with Al2O3 contents (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.78). This suggests that the REE contents of dolomitic shales at Jiuqunao are likely controlled by both clay minerals and authigenic carbonates, and their low REE concentrations probably reflect the dilution of carbonates, as is the case for dolomitic shales in the Arctic Bay Formation (Turner and Kamber, 2012).\n\nThe presence of negative Ce anomalies appears to stand in contrast to other redox proxies (e.g. iron speciation; Li et al., 2015). The Miaohe siliceous shales have been altered by modern weathering as evidenced by low Fepy\/FeHR values in surface, but not sub-surface samples (Bridger et al., 2021). However, the Ce anomalies in Miaohe shales show no covariation with either of these parameters (Fig. 8\n), implying negligible influence of weathering on Ce anomalies, consistent with the retention of iron oxides (high Feox\/FeHR). The absence of covariation between Eu anomalies, REE contents and Ce anomalies (Fig. 9\n) indicates that the bulk rock REE patterns have not been significantly modified by diagenetic processes (Shields and Stille, 2001; Pi et al., 2013). In addition, although Ce anomalies covary positively with Ti contents in the Member IV shales at the Jiuqunao and Jiulongwan sections, the Miaohe shales at the Miaohe section display only a very weak negative covariation between Ce anomalies and Ti contents (Fig. 10\n). Assuming that Ti is derived from detrital minerals, one would predict a positive covariation between Ti and Ce anomaly if there were a dominant detrital control. Instead, the weak negative covariation between Ti contents and Ce anomalies observed in the Miaohe siliceous shales implies that they more likely have preserved the primary REE patterns of non-detrital authigenic minerals\/phases. As mentioned above, the Miaohe Member is dominated by black siliceous shale (mean TOC 1.2%) with no evident phosphate concretions (Bridger et al., 2021) and low P2O5 content (mean 0.05%). Therefore, the negative Ce anomalies observed in the Miaohe shales could again be associated with organic matter, while the effects of phosphogenesis, if any, would be minimal. In addition, it has been proposed that silicification would dilute elemental concentrations except for Si without fractionating REE patterns of cherts (Murray, 1994). Considering that the seawater-like REE patterns more likely occur in samples with lower REE contents (Fig. 6a), it is also possible that the negative Ce anomalies are related in part with silica and this is further corroborated by sequential leaching results of the Miaohe siliceous shales (Fig. 6b).\nThe first leachate, namely carbonate\/oxide fraction, is characterized by a negative Ce anomaly and MREE enrichment (Fig. 6b). Some oxidised pyrite could have been dissolved by the first leach, but pyrite is generally depleted in REE (~0.88\u00a0ppm; Wolfe et al., 2016). Phosphate minerals, being of low abundance, would also not influence the overall REE patterns. Considering the work by Phan et al. (2018) and given the similarity of REE patterns between organic matter fraction and the carbonate\/oxide fraction (Fig. 6b), it seems possible that the REE in minor authigenic carbonate of the Miaohe shales could have been inherited from organic matter remineralization during early diagenesis. A major contribution from iron oxide can also not be excluded considering its relatively high content in shales and characteristic MREE enrichment (Haley et al., 2004; Bridger et al., 2021). One interesting implication is that if REE in authigenic carbonate cements (or carbonate and\/or phosphate nodule cores) are mainly derived from organic matter or other phases bearing significant negative Ce anomalies, their REE characteristics may not be indicative of the redox conditions of bottom waters and\/or pore waters. Negative Ce anomalies, if not diluted by non-fractionated REE or the reductive dissolution of minerals bearing positive Ce anomalies, could therefore persist in anoxic conditions (Adebayo et al., 2020; Bonnand et al., 2020). This might explain the pronounced negative Ce anomalies in phosphate nodule cores in the Mufu Mountain black shales, which precipitated beneath an anoxic water column (Jiang et al., 2007).\nThe REE pattern of the organic matter fraction (Fig. 6b) is characterized by LREE enrichment, a pronounced negative Ce anomaly (average 0.62), and high REE content (average 118\u00a0ppm). A simple mass balance calculation (cf. Abanda and Hannigan, 2006) reveals that the kerogen on average accounts for only ~3% of the total REE content of the whole rock. Nevertheless, it is possible that abundant organic matter in this highly productive environment could have been degraded during early diagenesis, the REE composition of which may be incorporated into authigenic phases (e.g. carbonate and silicate). In this case, organic matter may have a large indirect yet hard to constrain contribution to the bulk rock REE content. On the other hand, the organic matter REE pattern indicates that significant negative Ce anomalies can be preserved in organic matter (Fig. 6b). As mentioned above, \u03b4238U and \u03b498Mo data documented a global oceanic oxygenation event during deposition of the Miaohe Member (e.g. Kendall et al., 2015; Ostrander et al., 2019). Thus, the negative Ce anomalies in organic matter may reflect the higher oxygen contents of regional surface waters.\nThe silicate fraction exhibits the most seawater-like REE pattern (Fig. 6b), significantly different from an analogous study on the Middle Devonian Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Basin, USA, which displays a relatively flat pattern (Phan et al., 2018). Although HREE enriched patterns have been reported from detrital fractions, they are usually characterized by the absence of a Ce anomaly and high REE contents (e.g. Gong et al., 2021). Therefore, the seawater-like pattern with a negative Ce anomaly in the silicate fraction of the Miaohe siliceous shales suggests that the chert may have precipitated from oxic shallow water. It has been proposed that silica precipitation can be triggered by flocculation with Fe oxyhydroxides in hydrothermal fluids (Grenne and Slack, 2003). The REE pattern of the silicate fraction exhibits a pronounced positive Eu anomaly (Fig. 6b), and the nearby Member IV shales at the Jiuqunao section exhibit slightly positive Eu anomalies (average 1.33; Fig. 6a) which display no covariation with Ba\/Nd contents. A recent study also reveals the existence of hydrothermal activity in South China during the late Ediacaran (Xiao et al., 2020). Given the supersaturation of silica in Proterozoic seawater (Siever, 1992; Maliva et al., 2005) and evidence of hydrothermal activity, the silica in the Miaohe siliceous shales may originally derive from hydrothermal venting into the basin and subsequent precipitation. Alternatively, the chert may be formed or reworked during early diagenesis, which could incorporate REE from porewaters where the degraded organic matter may dominate the REE source (Freslon et al., 2014). A biogenic source for the silica, e.g. from siliceous plankton (Guo et al., 2007), seems unlikely as there is so far no convincing evidence to support the appearance of silica-secreting organisms before the Cambrian Period (e.g. Zhang and Feng, 2019). Therefore, while a biological origin for the silica may be tempting, it is not applicable to explain its occurrence in the Doushantuo Formation.\nConsidering that the silicate portion constitutes the major part of siliceous shales at both Miaohe and Jiuqunao sections, the shales' seawater-like patterns and negative Ce anomalies are interpreted to derive largely from chert, even though it has a relatively low REE content. Our results confirm that authigenic phases in shales can preserve seawater REE signals and cause deviations away from the typically flat, bulk shale REE pattern. Given the wide occurrence of shales in geological records, the REE patterns of authigenic phases in shales show great promise for reflecting the geochemistry of ancient oceans.\n\n\n\n5.3\nResponses of Ce anomalies to Earth system evolution\n\n5.3.1\nOxygenic photosynthesis\nOxygenic photosynthesis is one of the most important biological innovations in Earth history, with cyanobacteria being the first organisms capable of such a metabolism. The by-product of oxygenic photosynthesis, oxygen, plays an important role in regulating the redox state of Earth's atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, and in framing biological evolution (Fischer et al., 2016). Despite its importance in shaping our Earth system, there is however no consensus when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved, and estimates for the timing of this evolutionary innovation span from ca. 3.8 to 2.4\u00a0Ga (e.g. Rosing and Frei, 2004; Kirschvink and Kopp, 2008; Lyons et al., 2014; Planavsky et al., 2014a; Fischer et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Previous evidence, such as stromatolites, carbon isotope ratios and microfossils, may not be unique to cyanobacteria (e.g. Knoll, 2003; Tabita et al., 2007). Whilst the discovery of 2\u03b1-methylhopane in ca. 2.7\u00a0Ga Pilbara Craton shales was considered to be a sign for the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis (Brocks et al., 1999), these molecular fossils are now considered to be derived from nonindigenous hydrocarbons (Rasmussen et al., 2008; French et al., 2015). Other bacterial groups (e.g. Acidobacteria) can also produce the precursors of 2\u03b1-methylhopane (Fischer et al., 2016).\nIn the absence of robust body and molecular fossil records, researchers try to evaluate the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis by tracing the rise of oxygen in the surface environment, based on the assumption that no other significant oxygen source except for oxygenic photosynthesis existed on the early Earth (Lyons et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2016). Cr and U isotopes indicate that continental oxidative weathering likely started before 3.0\u00a0Ga, arguably as early as 3.8\u00a0Ga (Crowe et al., 2013; Frei et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Mo isotope records suggest that manganese oxidation in the water column and therefore biological oxygen production may have emerged at ~3.0\u00a0Ga (Planavsky et al., 2014a; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). While aerobic nitrogen cycling may have occurred at around ca. 2.7\u20132.5\u00a0Ga (Busigny et al., 2013), Se isotope records support surface oxidative weathering at ca. 2.5\u00a0Ga (St\u00fceken et al., 2015). Nevertheless, geochemical interpretations of rising oxygen levels are plagued by secondary alteration. For example, the Cr isotopic evidence indicating oxidative weathering in the Mesoarchean (Crowe et al., 2013) has been interpreted to be a result of modern oxidative weathering (Albut et al., 2018). More recently, Slotznick et al. (2022) argues that the Mo enrichment in the Mount McRae Shale in Western Australia was more likely induced by postdepositional alteration, and therefore does not reflect an enlarged oceanic Mo pool (Anbar et al., 2007). Therefore, it is important to find independent constraints for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis (Hayashi et al., 2004; Planavsky et al., 2020; Bonnand et al., 2020).\nDue to the similar reduction potentials of Ce and Mn, and the intimate association of Ce redox processes with Mn cycling (e.g. Ohta and Kawabe, 2001; Tostevin et al., 2016b), Ce anomaly records could potentially capture the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Although the underlying assumption is that Mn cycling during the Archean was mainly driven by oxygen, several recent studies argue for manganese oxidation either by abiotically photochemical reactions (Liu et al., 2020a) or by anoxygenic photosynthesis (Daye et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2020a) demonstrated oxidation of Mn(II) in rhodochrosite by ultraviolet light without oxygen, but as pointed out by Lyons et al. (2020), rhodochrosite has only rarely been reported from Archean rock records. Daye et al. (2019) showed that microorganisms are capable of oxidizing Mn in the absence of oxygen. Manganese oxides were only found on cell surfaces when Chlorobium sp. and other microorganisms were co-cultured (Daye et al., 2019). The relative contribution of anaerobic Mn oxidation to the Mn cycle during the Archean is therefore unclear (Lyons et al., 2020; Ostrander et al., 2021). In this regard, we tentatively consider that although anaerobic pathways of Mn oxidation are conceivable, they did not govern Mn cycling during the Archean.\nIn our compilation, Ce anomaly values are mainly distributed between 0.8 and 1.2 during the Archean (Fig. 11c, 12\n\n). If valid, the more highly negative (mainly found in carbonate rocks) and positive Ce anomalies (mainly found in iron formations) would imply the operation of oxidative Mn cycling (e.g. Tostevin et al., 2016b) and the presence of molecular oxygen during the Archean. However, as mentioned in Section 3.2, normalisation and analytical artefacts can lead to Ce anomalies between 0.9 and 1.1, and several studies concluded that previously proposed Ce anomalies were artefacts (e.g. Bekker et al., 2014; Kamber et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the mean deviation of Ce anomaly from 1.0 is slightly greater than 0.1 during the interval 3.0\u20132.5\u00a0Ga (Fig. 13\n), probably due to more recently reported Ce anomalies from Neoarchean and late Mesoarchean carbonate rocks and iron formations (e.g. Riding et al., 2014; Han et al., 2014; Fralick and Riding, 2015; Cabral et al., 2016; Siahi et al., 2018; Hiebert et al., 2018). It has been noticed that some Archean marine sediments show an upswing of LREE in shale normalised patterns, similar to the W-type tetrad effect usually observed in chondrite-normalized REE patterns (e.g. Ernst and Bau, 2021), which may give rise to apparent Ce anomalies if calculated from a linear extrapolation (e.g. Kamber et al., 2014). It has also been proposed that a polynomial fit may quantify Ce anomalies better in the case of curved REE patterns (e.g. Kamber et al., 2014; Anenburg and Williams, 2021). To test whether significant Ce anomalies are produced by normalisation effects, we calculated Ce anomalies following the method of Kamber et al. (2014) who predicted expected CeN content using a second-order polynomial fit to normalised REE abundance versus ionic radii. It is found that whilst positive Ce anomalies can be diminished by as much as 20% through a second-order polynomial fit, negative Ce anomaly values have been increased in most cases. Consequently, it is unlikely that the negative Ce anomalies (<0.85) reported after 2014 are caused by normalisation artefacts (e.g. Riding et al., 2014; Fralick and Riding, 2015). Table 3\n gives a brief summary of all the negative Ce anomalies (<0.85) in the filtered dataset before GOE (i.e. before ~2.43\u00a0Ga). It seems that the ca. 2.8\u00a0Ga Mosher Carbonate Formation holds the greatest potential to indicate oxygenic photosynthesis in our compilation. It is also interesting to note that different results have been obtained from the same stratigraphic unit. For example, Planavsky et al. (2010) found no Ce anomaly but Riding et al. (2014) and Fralick and Riding (2015) obtained negative Ce anomalies (~0.7) from the Mosher Carbonate Formation in Canada. Given the huge thickness of the Mosher Carbonate Formation and the relatively low sample resolution, these two conflicting results are not mutually incompatible. Specifically, Planavsky et al. (2010) mainly analysed stromatolites while negative Ce anomalies were mainly found in crystal fans (Riding et al., 2014; Fralick and Riding, 2015). While crystal fans precipitated abiotically on the seafloor, stromatolites are considered to be biologically mediated but largely comprise subsurface anaerobic microenvironments (see Hohl and Viehmann (2021) for a review). Therefore, the presence of negative Ce anomalies (<0.85) might indicate the build-up of oxygen in the shallow Archean marine environment, but readers are reminded of the work of Hayashi et al. (2004) who demonstrated that altered iron formations may also show seawater-like patterns. In short, from the perspective of Ce anomalies, our compilation suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis possibly evolved during 3.0\u20132.5\u00a0Ga, but the antiquity of those negative Ce anomalies (especially in carbonate rocks) needs to be further confirmed through isotopic analysis (e.g. La-Ce and Sm-Nd).\n\n\n5.3.2\nThe Great Oxidation Episode and its aftermath\nThe global accumulation of atmospheric oxygen with concentrations of >10\u22125 present atmospheric level (PAL) in the early Paleoproterozoic that is generally termed the Great Oxidation Event (GOE; e.g. Holland, 2006) or Great Oxidation Episode (Poulton et al., 2021) changed the nature of Earth's habitability once and for all (Canfield, 2005). The origin of the GOE has been hotly debated. Kopp et al. (2005) associated the GOE with the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and proposed that transformation of CH4 to CO2 via reactions with O2 diminished the greenhouse effect, thus triggering global cooling. It is also suggested that the rise of atmospheric oxygen was induced by the waning of oxygen sinks, such as decreased outgassing of reduced species, possibly due to a change from submarine volcanism to a mixture of submarine and subaerial volcanism (Kump and Barley, 2007) and\/or due to a gradual increase of mantle oxygen fugacity (Kadoya et al., 2020). More recently, Eguchi et al. (2020) proposed that enhanced volcanic CO2 degassing increased both carbonate and organic carbon burial resulting in the oxygenation.\nNotwithstanding the mystery surrounding its origins, the GOE is evidenced by the disappearance of redox-sensitive detrital grains (e.g. pyrite, uraninite, and siderite; Holland, 1984), appearance of red beds (Chandler, 1980), gypsum deposits (El Tabakh et al., 1999), and oxidized paleosols (Rye and Holland, 1998). So far, the transition from mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (MIF-S) to mass-dependent fractionation (MDF-S) is the most accepted proxy tracer for the GOE (e.g. Farquhar et al., 2000; Bekker et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2016; Warke et al., 2020; Poulton et al., 2021), although the interpretation of this proxy is complicated by possible recycling of the MIF-S signal in the upper curst (\u2018crustal memory effects\u2019; Reinhard et al., 2013). The initial loss of MIF-S places the onset of the GOE at ~2.43\u00a0Ga preceding the Paleoproterozoic \u2018Snowball Earth\u2019 (Warke et al., 2020), and the permanent loss of MIF-S is constrained to about 2.22\u00a0Ga just before the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE) (Poulton et al., 2021).\nSedimentary Ce anomaly records should also respond to the rise of oxygen levels. This is because, in general, Ce oxidation ought to be more efficient when oxygen levels are higher, although Ce anomalies are also influenced by other factors, such as pH and water depth (De Baar et al., 1985; Bellefroid et al., 2018). With that in mind, one would expect variations in Ce anomaly either in terms of mean values or in the range of values before and after the onset of the GOE. However, in our compilation, there appears to be no significant change in either the mean (or mean negative Ce anomaly) or range of Ce anomaly values between the time-bins of 2700\u20132500\u00a0Ma and 2500\u20132300\u00a0Ma (Fig. 13b, d). This may be due to the fact that compiled samples in the 2500\u20132300\u00a0Ma bin were mainly deposited before 2.43\u00a0Ga prior to the proposed onset of the GOE (Warke et al., 2020) and is consistent with a prolonged episode of oxygen reversals before permanent surface oxygenation (Poulton et al., 2021). Following the permanent loss of MIF-S, a pronounced positive carbon isotope excursion, namely the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE), occurred between ca. 2.22 and 2.06\u00a0Ga (e.g. Karhu and Holland, 1996; Fig. 11b), during which time oxygen levels are thought to have reached their Paleoproterozoic peak (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2012). The available Ce anomaly data during the LJE interval display prominent negative Ce anomalies (~0.6; Fig. 11c), while mean negative Ce anomaly values exhibit a gradual decreasing trend from 2.5 to 2.1\u00a0Ga (Fig. 13b). Therefore, although the Ce anomaly record does not capture the onset of the GOE, it is nonetheless consistent with a rise of oxygen during the early Paleoproterozoic.\nThere was a supposed downturn of oxygen levels following the LJE (e.g. Partin et al., 2013; Bellefroid et al., 2018). However, recent findings from the Zaonega Formation in the Onega Basin that was deposited shortly after the LJE challenge this view (e.g. M\u00e4nd et al., 2020; Kipp et al., 2020; Kreitsmann et al., 2020). Carbonate rocks in the Zaonega Formation also show pronounced negative Ce anomalies (~0.4; Fig. 11c). Although probably related to turbidity deposits (Melezhik et al., 2015; Joosu et al., 2015; Paiste et al., 2018), it is difficult to reconcile such significant negative Ce anomalies with previous estimations of low oxygen levels (e.g. Partin et al., 2013). Furthermore, the Zaonega shales are characterized by high Mo and U concentrations and isotope values (M\u00e4nd et al., 2020; Fig. 11d, e), consistent with high oxyanion concentrations in seawater after the LJE. Although the exact mechanism for this oxygenation event remains uncertain, it is likely associated with a large seawater sulfate reservoir (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018; Kipp et al., 2020), which would boost both phosphorus cycling (Joosu et al., 2015; Kipp et al., 2020) and pyrite burial due to enhanced organic matter remineralization under euxinic conditions (Laakso et al., 2020), stimulating primary productivity and oxygen production. Such feedbacks likely terminated when the sulfate reservoir was relatively diminished.\n\n\n5.3.3\n\u2018Boring Billion\u2019?\nThe time period between 1800 and 800\u00a0Ma (mid-Proterozoic) is commonly called the \u2018Boring Billion\u2019 due to the muted carbon isotope records and relative stasis in biological evolution (Buick et al., 1995; Brasier and Lindsay, 1998; Holland, 2006). The origin of the last eukaryote common ancestor (LECA) is constrained to <1.9\u00a0Ga (Betts et al., 2018) and widely accepted eukaryotic microfossils such as Tappania and Valeria are known from the ~1.7\u00a0Ga Ruyang Group and the ~1.6\u00a0Ga Changcheng Group on the North China Craton (Pang et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2019), while the diversification of crown group eukaryotes possibly initiated around 800\u00a0Ma (Knoll, 2014). The near one-billion-year temporal lag between the emergence of eukaryotic microfossils and the radiation of eukaryotes remains enigmatic. Nevertheless, the discovery of likely multicellular eukaryotes in the ~1.56\u00a0Ga Gaoyuzhuang Formation in North China (Zhu et al., 2016), possibly linked to transient oxygenation events (e.g. Zhang et al., 2018a; Diamond and Lyons, 2018) delineates an emerging picture that Earth's middle age was rather more interesting than previously imagined.\nThe macronutrient phosphorus level was presumably low during the mid-Proterozoic, which could have supressed biological evolution (Reinhard et al., 2017, 2020). However, as pointed out by Canfield et al. (2020), the compilation of Reinhard et al. (2017) could have over-estimated Corg contents due to a lack of sandstones and grey shales in the compilation. So far, there are few constraints on past ocean phosphate concentrations (Dodd et al., 2021), but it has been proposed that changes in the availability of bio-essential trace elements (e.g. Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo) could have affected biological innovation and diversification (Mukherjee et al., 2018). Although Cr isotopes and Ce oxidation modelling suggest atmospheric oxygen concentrations of only <0.1\u20131% PAL during the mid-Proterozoic (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2014b; Bellefroid et al., 2018), other proxy studies indicate pO2\u00a0>\u00a01\u20134% PAL at ca. 1.6\u00a0Ga, 1.4\u00a0Ga, 1.3\u00a0Ga, and 1.1\u00a0Ga (e.g. Zhang et al., 2016; Canfield et al., 2018; Gilleaudeau et al., 2019; Shang et al., 2019). The discrepancies between different estimates may come from different assumptions made to assess atmospheric oxygen levels (e.g. Bellefroid et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the occurrence of discrete oxygenation events during the mid-Proterozoic is widely accepted. Importantly, since early animals might survive at oxygen levels of >1\u20134% PAL (Mills et al., 2014), evaluating the oxygen increases during this period is critical to fully understand the co-evolution of eukaryotes (animals) and environments.\nCe anomalies of the shallow marine realm are skewed to lower values, mainly distributed between 0.7 and 0.9 with a median value of 0.80, during the mid-Proterozoic (Fig. 12a). Meanwhile, mean negative Ce anomalies gradually decrease from about 1.8 to 1.0\u00a0Ga (Fig. 13b). A recent compilation of carbonate Ce anomalies also reveals a gentle decrease in values from 1.2 to 1.0\u00a0Ga (Liu et al., 2021). The subsequent increase in mean negative Ce anomalies from about 1.0 to 0.7\u00a0Ga may not be genuine since there are insufficient filtered data in our compilation during that period (Fig. 11, 13), but it is noteworthy that such an increase coincides with a global transition from sulfidic to ferruginous mid-depth waters (Guilbaud et al., 2015). From the perspective of Ce anomalies, there seems to have been a prolonged oxidation of the ocean-atmosphere system during the mid-Proterozoic (Fig. 13b). Such long-term oxidation seems to have been punctuated by transient oxygenation events as evidenced by modern-like negative Ce anomaly values (<0.6) at ca. 1.4\u00a0Ga and 1.1\u00a0Ga and high Mo and U isotope values in shales and carbonates at ca. 1.56\u00a0Ga, 1.4\u00a0Ga and 1.1\u00a0Ga (Fig. 11). Potentially, the large igneous provinces associated with the breakup of Nuna and the mountain collisions related to the amalgamation of Nuna and Rodinia (Fig. 11) may have enhanced nutrient input via weathering, thus stimulating organic carbon burial and oxygen production (Campbell and Allen, 2008; Horton, 2015). However, it should be mentioned that most Ce anomaly data for the mid-Proterozoic are from North and South China cratons, and therefore whether Ce anomaly evidence for long-term oxygenation during the mid-Proterozoic tells an accurate story awaits more supporting data from other paleo-continents and redox proxies (e.g. Cr, U, and Mo isotopes).\n\nLiu et al. (2021) estimated atmospheric oxygen levels of 1\u20132% PAL during the mid-Proterozoic based on a thermodynamics-based Ce oxidation model. This model assumes chemical thermodynamic equilibrium for the Ce oxidation reaction involving pure CeO2 as the final product, although Ce oxidation to a large extent is kinetically controlled by Mn oxide (Ohta and Kawabe, 2001). The predicted thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of Ce(III) in modern seawater is also two or three orders of magnitude lower than the measured Ce(III) concentration (De Baar et al., 2018). Consequently, the modelling results based on thermodynamic equilibrium may provide constraints on minimum rather than realistic atmospheric oxygen levels. Moreover, the estimation of Liu et al. (2021) considered only the lowest 10% of values in different time intervals. Such an approach will lead to pO2 biased to higher values since the Ce anomaly is a local-to-regional redox proxy. Taking these caveats into account, and based on the new compilation, we adopt the thermodynamic equilibrium approach to place new constraints on minimum levels of atmospheric oxygen during the mid-Proterozoic. Instead of choosing the lowest 10% numbers, we use all negative Ce anomaly (<1) data (not including shales) in different time bins (Fig. 13d) to calculate pO2, which is shown as a mean with a\u00a0\u00b1\u00a090% confidence interval (Fig. 14\n). Positive Ce anomalies are not included because they are usually indicative of reductive dissolution in anoxic waters, although they indicate surface oxygenation elsewhere (e.g. Tostevin et al., 2016b). As shown in Fig. 14, the modelling results suggest minimum atmospheric oxygen levels of 1\u20136% PAL during most of the mid-Proterozoic, broadly consistent with the minimum constraints (2\u201324% PAL) inferred from the proportion of recycled graphite in kerogen by Raman analyses (Canfield et al., 2021). The estimated oxygen levels during the mid-Proterozoic were likely sufficient for algae and potentially also for early animals (Mills et al., 2014), implying that atmospheric oxygen levels may not have been a major direct inhibitor to early eukaryote diversification.\nAlthough the Ce anomalies in the deep marine realm are mainly distributed between 1.1 and 1.3 implying an anoxic deep ocean during the mid-Proterozoic, the limited datapoints necessitate caution (Fig. 12b). Indeed, the temporal evolution of Fe3+\/\u2211Fe ratios in ophiolitic basalts suggests an oxygen concentration of ~11\u00a0\u03bcM in the deep mid-Proterozoic ocean (Stolper and Keller, 2018). Oxic or suboxic deep marine conditions have been reported from the ca. 1.85\u00a0Ga Stambaugh Formation in the Animikie Basin (Planavsky et al., 2018). Small negative to small positive Ce anomalies in deep seawater Fe-Si precipitates related to ca. 1.8\u20131.7\u00a0Ga volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits have been attributed to suboxic water columns (Slack et al., 2007, 2009). Based on iron speciation data in the Kaltasy Formation of Russia, Sperling et al. (2014) suggested the presence of oxygen in a basinal environment at ca. 1.42\u00a0Ga. It has also been proposed that deep water was oxygenated during deposition of the ca. 1.4\u00a0Ga Xiamaling Formation (Liu et al., 2020b). Therefore, although it has long been considered that the redox state of the mid-Proterozoic ocean can be characterised as having oxic surface waters and anoxic deep waters, ocean redox conditions could have varied frequently and significantly.\nThe other intriguing point is that Ce anomaly records of shales are generally comparable to that of coeval chemical sedimentary rocks (Fig. 11b). As discussed above (Section 5.2.5), the negative Ce anomalies in authigenic phases of shales might be a promising proxy to trace redox conditions of ancient oceans. Further to this inference, significant negative Ce anomalies in Tonian shales (i.e. 1000\u2013~720\u00a0Ma) might be indicative of oxygenation event(s) that affected eukaryotic evolution. This is discussed in more detail in the following section.\n\n\n5.3.4\nNeoproterozoic\nDuring the Neoproterozoic Era (1000\u2013~540\u00a0Ma), the Earth experienced significant climatic change, tectonic upheaval, and oxygenation of the ocean-atmosphere system, culminating in the radiation of large, complex animals (Shields, 2017; Knoll and Nowak, 2017). The Tonian Period that bridges the end of the \u2018Boring Billion\u2019 and the onset of the Cryogenian \u2018Snowball Earth\u2019 has attracted increasing attention in recent years (e.g. Zhou et al., 2020; Guilbaud et al., 2020). Although molecular fossils suggest that algae (Archaeplastida) did not emerge until the Cryogenian Period (Brocks et al., 2017), abundant macroscopic algae fossils have been discovered from the Tonian formations of North China (e.g. Li et al., 2020b; Tang et al., 2020) and Canada (Maloney et al., 2021). Biomarker evidence from the Chuar and Visings\u00f6 Groups indicates a late Tonian rise of red algae (Zumberge et al., 2020), while macroalgal diversity also experienced a Tonian acme (Bykova et al., 2020). These findings suggest that algal eukaryotes may have come into ecological importance in the early Neoproterozoic. The Tonian also witnessed significant fluctuations in carbon and sulfur cycling as revealed by the Garvellach, Islay, and Bitter Springs carbon isotope excursions (Fig. 11b; Shields, 2017; Greenman et al., 2020) and evaporite giant deposition (e.g. Evans, 2006; Prince et al., 2019; Shields et al., 2019). In addition, multiple geochemical proxies, such as iron speciation (Sperling et al., 2013), iodine concentration (W\u00f6rndle et al., 2019), Cr isotopes (Planavsky et al., 2014b), Se isotopes (Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2015), and Mo isotopes (O\u2019Sullivan et al., 2020) suggest that oxygen levels could have varied during the Tonian Period. Interestingly, there are only few available filtered Ce anomaly data from Tonian chemical sedimentary rocks. This is not due to a lack of published analyses (Supplementary Table S1) but because most data have been screened out due to their flat or MREE-arching patterns (e.g. Shuster et al., 2018; Ward et al., 2019; Virgo et al., 2021). It has been proposed that MREE enriched patterns in carbonates reflect a primary feature of anoxic bottom waters (e.g. Hood and Wallace, 2015), but the full hat-shaped pattern has not been discovered in modern redox stratified basins, although the acidic Colour Lake shows a slight tendency towards MREE arching (Johannesson and Lyons, 1995). Additionally, some siliceous shales of Tonian age exhibit seawater-like REE patterns and significant negative Ce anomalies (Hu et al., 2020). This shale-carbonate REE pattern paradox requires further investigation. Overall, considering the other redox proxies and more recent paleontological findings, the Tonian Era witnessed significant changes in surface environments and biological evolution, whereas details await corroboration.\nDuring the Neoproterozoic Era (1000\u2013~540\u00a0Ma), the Earth experienced significant climatic change, tectonic upheaval, and oxygenation of the ocean-atmosphere system, culminating in the radiation of large, complex animals (Shields, 2017; Knoll and Nowak, 2017).

It has been proposed that MREE enriched patterns in carbonates reflect a primary feature of anoxic bottom waters (e.g. Hood and Wallace, 2015), but the full hat-shaped pattern has not been discovered in modern redox stratified basins, although the acidic Colour Lake shows a slight tendency towards MREE arching (Johannesson and Lyons, 1995). Additionally, some siliceous shales of Tonian age exhibit seawater-like REE patterns and significant negative Ce anomalies (Hu et al., 2020). This shale-carbonate REE pattern paradox requires further investigation. Overall, considering the other redox proxies and more recent paleontological findings, the Tonian Period witnessed significant changes in surface environments and biological evolution, whereas details await corroboration.\nA rise in oxygen levels during the late Neoproterozoic has long been recognised and is termed the NOE or \u2018Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event\u2019 (Och and Shields-Zhou, 2012) or by analogy to the GOE (Poulton et al., 2021) and due to its prolonged character, the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Episode. A previous Ce anomaly compilation suggests fluctuating oxygen levels during the NOE (Wallace et al., 2017). In contrast, although the Ce anomalies in our compilation show wide ranges in the period of 800\u2013~540\u00a0Ma (Fig. 12), the mean and median Ce anomaly values gradually decrease from the late Tonian to the Ediacaran (and even further into the early Cambrian; Fig. 15\n). ANOVA (analysis of variance) results indicate that mean Ce anomalies in the late Tonian, Cryogenian, and Ediacaran are statistically indistinguishable (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) but are distinct from that of the early Cambrian (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; Table 4\n). It should be mentioned that mean Ce anomalies are skewed to unity (1.0) due to the existence of both positive and negative values (especially for the Ediacaran). However, as shown in Fig. 13b, average negative Ce anomalies also exhibit a long-term decreasing trend. Statistical analysis confirms that the mean values of negative Ce anomalies are distinguishable from the Cryogenian, Ediacaran to the early Cambrian (ANOVA test, p values <0.01). Therefore, Ce anomaly data illuminate a long-term progressive oxygenation of the ocean-atmosphere system during the NOE with estimated pO2 as high as 20% PAL (Fig. 14), which is also consistent with Se and Mo isotope results (Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015b).\nWithin the NOE, there could of course have been dynamic variations in oxygen levels over million-year time scales. RSE concentrations and isotopic data (e.g. U and Mo) suggest that episodic oxygenations followed glaciations (i.e. Sturtian, Marinoan, and Gaskiers) during the late Neoproterozoic (e.g. Sahoo et al., 2012, 2016; Lau et al., 2017). As with other redox proxies, Ce anomalies display transient lower values after each glaciation, reflecting increases in oxygen concentrations of the ocean-atmosphere system. These oxygenation events are possibly related to enhanced postglacial weathering (e.g. Shields et al., 1997) which would deliver abundant nutrients to the ocean, and subsequently, increase the primary productivity, organic carbon burial and thus oxygen production (e.g. Sahoo et al., 2016; Guilbaud et al., 2020).\nIt has been proposed that the deep ocean became ventilated after the Gaskiers glaciation, providing habitable environments for animal radiations (Canfield et al., 2007, 2008; Shields et al., 2019). However, as mentioned above, short-lived deep ocean oxygenations may have occurred during Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic times, too (e.g. Planavsky et al., 2018). In addition, Ce anomalies in the deep marine realm during the late Neoproterozoic are mainly distributed between 0.9 and 1.2 with tails to both lower and higher values (Fig. 12b). Although the occurrence of negative Ce anomalies in the deep marine realm after the Gaskiers glaciation appears consistent with the previous view, our compilation indicates episodic deep ocean oxygenation before the Gaskiers glaciation, too. For example, cap carbonate rocks after the Marinoan glaciation, deposited in a slope environment in South China, retain significant negative Ce anomalies (e.g. Hohl et al., 2017). Rodler et al. (2016) also reported negative Ce anomalies (~0.7) from Otavi Group foreslope carbonate rocks deposited during the non-glacial Cryogenian interval. Well-preserved post-Sturtian glaciation limestones deposited in the outer-mid ramp environment from Western Mongolia (Bold et al., 2016) also contain significant negative Ce anomalies (~0.6; Shields et al., 1997; Shields et al., 2002). These negative Ce anomalies could reflect deepening of redoxclines due to additional oxygen production after glaciations. Although the possibility of turbidites or density flow producing such signals cannot be completely ruled out (e.g. Hohl et al., 2015), U isotope mass balance modelling suggests that the global extent of ocean anoxia could have declined significantly at the initial stage of the Cryogenian non-glacial interval (Lau et al., 2017).\nIt is interesting to note that the greatest variations in Ce anomalies occurred in the late Ediacaran (Fig. 11c), whereby pronounced positive Ce anomalies have been interpreted as intermediate manganous conditions (Tostevin et al., 2016b). Previous studies based on U isotopes indicate that seafloor anoxia could have fluctuated significantly in the late Ediacaran (e.g. Zhang et al., 2018b, 2019a; Tostevin et al., 2019). It has been proposed that such redox oscillations governed both radiations and extinctions of Ediacaran biota given the broad coincidence of redox changes with the evolution of Ediacaran biotic assemblages (e.g. Zhang et al., 2019a). However, ecological evolution possibly occurred in different isolated geographic settings and may not be governed by global trends of redox evolution. Integrated geochemical and paleontological evidence from Namibia also suggests that the onset of anoxia expansion postdated the occurrence of skeletal fauna, thus challenging the previous view (Tostevin et al., 2019). Obviously, the interrelationship between early animal diversification and oceanic oxygenation is still open to debate. Nevertheless, the marine redoxcline could have varied significantly alongside oscillations of ocean anoxia in the late Ediacaran (Wood et al., 2019). It is therefore possible that the Ce anomaly variability reflects vertical movements and potentially a sharpening of the redoxcline through the period. In addition, it has also been proposed that the redox states of late Ediacaran ocean shelves were spatiotemporally heterogeneous (Li et al., 2018). Taken together, we infer that fluctuations in Ce anomalies were a hallmark of the late Ediacaran marine environment.\n\n\n5.3.5\nPhanerozoic\nThe oceanic oxygenation history across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition has received intensified scrutiny in recent years. With increasing resolution of U isotope records from carbonate rocks and shales, the emerging picture is that the ocean experienced dynamic redox fluctuations across this transition (Dahl et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a; Tostevin et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2020; Fig. 11e). In contrast, statistical analysis of iron speciation data indicates no significant change in oxygen levels from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian (Sperling et al., 2015). The apparently contradictory conclusions derived from iron speciation and U isotopes are commonly attributed to the different sensitivities of these two proxies to local and global redox conditions (e.g. Shields, 2017; Tostevin et al., 2019). Ce anomalies provide another important local redox proxy, which can therefore provide complementary nuance to the overall marine redox picture through the Proterozoic to Phanerozoic transition interval. As shown previously (Fig. 15; Table 4), progressive oxygenation during the NOE could have extended into the early Cambrian. Because the iron speciation compilation mainly focused on shales deposited near or below storm wave base (Sperling et al., 2015), it may have missed the shallow shelf environment where many eukaryotes, including animals thrived (Wood et al., 2019). Here, we further compared shallow marine Ce anomalies between the late Ediacaran (560\u2013~540\u00a0Ma) and the early Cambrian (~540\u2013510\u00a0Ma). The mean shallow marine Ce anomaly values of the early Cambrian (0.55) is significantly lower than that of the late Ediacaran (1.11), and are statistically different (t-test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). A 5000 times bootstrapped t-test gave the same result with a p-value of 0.0002. The mean value of negative Ce anomalies from shallow marine settings also decreased from the late Ediacaran (0.69) to the early Cambrian (0.55) and are statistically different (5000 times bootstrapped t-test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Therefore, it appears that while the deep ocean remained largely anoxic, the marine shelf experienced dynamic and progressive oxygenation across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. This also bolsters the suggestion that whilst iron speciation may better identify ferruginous and euxinic conditions in intermediate and deep waters, the Ce anomaly is more sensitive to oxic conditions in the water column, and when combined together, they can provide insightful views of oceanic redox structure.\nIntriguingly, despite great oscillations, the magnitude of negative Ce anomalies through the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition is only slightly less than that of the Carboniferous-Triassic interval (Fig. 11c, 13b) when the atmosphere is thought to have reached peak oxygen levels (Krause et al., 2018). This implies that oxygen concentrations should have increased significantly at least in the shallow marine shelf environment through the Ediacaran-Cambrian interval, which raises the question why the deep ocean remained anoxic under sufficient oxygen in the shelf environment. We tentatively suggest that this was because of the high nutrient fluxes and erosion at those times that may have permitted a large reservoir of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to build up in the ocean (e.g. Shields, 2017). There is growing evidence for the existence of DOC reservoirs from the Tonian to the Cambrian (Jiang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2019). More recently, Chen et al. (2022b) document the DOC hypothesis through an integrated carbon, sulfur, strontium and uranium isotope analysis of the Member II, Doushantuo Formation. The long-term decreasing trend of carbonate carbon isotopes, along with diminishing overall range in values, during the Ediacaran to the Cambrian (Wood et al., 2019) may potentially reflect the gradual oxidation of DOC reservoirs. Pulsed great oxidation of DOC pools may occur on a global scale as manifested by globally correlative negative carbon isotope excursions such as the Shuram anomaly (Shields et al., 2019). The extent of negative carbon isotope excursions becomes gradually smaller since the Shuram anomaly (Wood et al., 2019), suggesting shrinkage of the DOC reservoir buffer. Nevertheless, the size of the DOC reservoir may have waxed and waned, and been unevenly distributed, due to the non-uniformitarian nature of the Neoproterozoic-early Cambrian Earth system. Understanding the origin, size, and distribution of ocean DOC is critical to fully understand its role in regulating the carbon cycle and oxygen level on Earth. In short, our compilation provides geochemical evidence for high oxygen content in shallow seawater and paves the way to reconcile the evolution of animals with high metabolic demands and a largely anoxic deep ocean.\nIt should be noted that the cycling of trace metals, including REE, in the ocean may be different in the presence of a large DOC reservoir, but this is not yet well constrained. The DOC fraction is compositionally complex and its composition could also have varied as life on Earth evolved. Although organic complexation of REE in seawater is poorly constrained, it might not significantly affect REE speciation in modern oceans due to the low abundance of organic ligands (Schijf and Byrne, 2021). Nevertheless, it has been shown that the stability constants of REE-organic ligand complexes increase with increasing atomic number (e.g. Byrne and Li, 1995; Schijf and Byrne, 2021). However, laboratory experiments also indicate that humic and fulvic acids preferentially complex with MREE, and outcompete carbonate ions for REE at a pH of 5\u20138 (e.g. Pourret et al., 2007a, 2007b; Tang and Johannesson, 2010). This has been invoked to explain some MREE enriched patterns in organic-rich river waters (Pourret et al., 2007a). It has also been suggested that carbonate ions are more strongly HREE complexed compared with low molecular weight DOC (e.g. fulvic acid), and therefore, fluid in which the REE speciation is dominated by carbonate ions and low molecular weight DOC will tend to show HREE enriched patterns (e.g. Tang and Johannesson, 2010). On the other hand, it seems that both strong (e.g. DFOB; Schijf and Byrne, 2021) and weak (e.g. polysaccharides; Deng et al., 2020) organic ligands can form stable complexes with Ce(IV) in solution. If they are incorporated into marine sediments proportionally, one may expect pronounced positive Ce anomalies in chemical sedimentary rocks, although the influence of REE speciation on partitioning between solution and solid is poorly constrained (e.g. Zhong and Mucci, 1995).\nThe decoupling between estimated pO2 and permissible oxygen levels during 500\u2013400\u00a0Ma (Fig. 14) is likely due to low sampling resolution during this period (only 4 available negative Ce anomaly data). However, some de-oxygenation in the early Paleozoic is likely to have been a genuine phenomenon (e.g. Dahl et al., 2010). A recent Mo isotope compilation reveals a significant decrease in both \u03b498Mo and [Mo] in shales of the early Paleozoic (Ye et al., 2021). Proterozoic-like low I\/Ca values in carbonate rocks also occur in the early Paleozoic, which is sandwiched between two spikes in the early Cambrian and middle Devonian (Lu et al., 2018). In this regard, it is interesting to note that many Paleozoic phosphorites are characterized by hat-shaped REE patterns, the origin of which has been proposed to relate to expanded ocean anoxia (e.g. L\u00e9cuyer et al., 2004; Emsbo et al., 2015). The authors implied that reductive dissolution of Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides induced by anoxia will produce MREE-arching of the seawater pattern. However, there is so far no reported such seawater pattern in modern redox stratified basins except for decreased ratios of YbN\/PrN, DyN\/SmN, and Y\/Ho in modern anoxic seawater of the Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 2). Moreover, accompanying the dissolution of Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides, positive Ce anomalies are usually found in modern anoxic seawater (Tostevin, 2021), whereas phosphorites are almost always characterized by a negative or no Ce anomaly. In addition, ancient phosphorites commonly display a decreasing trend from Er to Lu in shale-normalised REE patterns (Emsbo et al., 2015), which is more likely related to diagenetic porewater exchange (Section 2.2.2). Taken together, we consider that the characteristic hat-shaped REE patterns of many Paleozoic (and some later) phosphorites are diagenetic phenomena, whereby anoxia may have contributed to the flux of LREE\/MREE-enriched particles to the seafloor.\nThere is growing evidence for pervasive ocean oxygenation in the late Paleozoic. The exact timing of this event varies with different redox proxies: early Devonian for Mo isotope records (Dahl et al., 2010), Ordovician-Devonian for iron speciation (Sperling et al., 2015), Silurian-Devonian for Fe3+\/\u2211Fe ratios (Stolper and Keller, 2018). In spite of differences in the timing, the origin of such an oxygenation event is often linked with the evolution and radiation of vascular plants (e.g. Dahl et al., 2010; Wallace et al., 2017). This is because vascular plants are assumed to accelerate weathering, delivering abundant nutrients to the ocean (Moulton et al., 2000), and also because these plants possess recalcitrant organic matter with much higher C\/P ratios (e.g. lignin) relative to marine organic matter (Kump, 1988). Increases in the terrestrial organic matter burial would therefore provide additional sources of oxygen to the ocean-atmosphere system (Algeo and Ingall, 2007).\nA previous Ce anomaly compilation indicates a de-oxygenation in the early Paleozoic and significant ocean oxygenation in the late Devonian (Wallace et al., 2017). The trend revealed in our compilation (Fig. 11c, 13b) is broadly consistent with this conclusion. However, the Ce anomaly compilation of Wallace et al. (2017) mainly focused on shallow rather than deep marine carbonate rocks. We therefore divided our Phanerozoic compilation into two time-bins (Fig. 12), i.e. early Paleozoic (~540\u2013393\u00a0Ma) and post-early Devonian (393\u20130\u00a0Ma) and conducted statistical analyses for both the shallow and deep marine Ce anomalies. In the early Paleozoic, the mean Ce anomaly values are 0.57 for the shallow marine realm and 0.56 for deep marine realm, while the mean Ce anomaly values are 0.56 and 0.48 for shallow and deep marine realms, respectively, in the second time bin (393\u20130\u00a0Ma). 5000 times bootstrapped t-test suggests that the Ce anomaly means are statistically indistinguishable between time bins for shallow (p\u00a0=\u00a00.730) and deep (p\u00a0=\u00a00.069) marine realms. Mann-Whitney U tests for equal median values cannot be rejected at 5% significance level between time bins for shallow (p\u00a0=\u00a00.533) and deep (p\u00a0=\u00a00.824) marine realms. Therefore, it seems that there was no significant change in Ce anomalies before and after the middle Devonian. However, this apparent stasis could be caused by sampling bias. For example, the Ce anomaly data in the early Paleozoic are skewed to the early Cambrian, which suggests more oxygenated conditions, while scarcer post-Cambrian data suggest expansive anoxia. In this case, the Ce anomaly data in the early Paleozoic may produce false negative results (i.e. the mean value is estimated lower). On the other hand, the Ce anomaly data after the early Devonian are biased to critical geological junctions, such as mass extinction events and oceanic anoxic events (OAE), which bears the risk of producing false positive results (i.e. the mean value is estimated higher). With these caveats in mind, it is conceivable that mean differences between the two time-bins could be larger. Furthermore, although Ce anomalies changed significantly upon mass extinction events or oceanic anoxic events, such as at ~372\u00a0Ma (Frasnian-Famennian extinction), ~250\u00a0Ma (end-Permian extinction), ~200\u00a0Ma (end-Triassic extinction), ~93\u00a0Ma (OAE2), the extent of variation is much lower than that in the Precambrian with only a few data exceeding 1.0. This implies that the ocean may have reached a relatively homogenized state much like the modern ocean before the late Devonian extinction, suggesting that pervasive ocean oxygenation likely occurred no later than the middle Devonian.\nIt is interesting to note that I\/Ca ratios in shallow marine carbonates reveal a large rise in the Devonian, then a significant decline between 400 and 200\u00a0Ma followed by a second large rise after 200\u00a0Ma (Lu et al., 2018). The low values between 400 and 200\u00a0Ma are attributed to the expansion of relatively shallow OMZs due to intensified marine oxygen consumption, while the later rise is attributed to the advent of larger primary producers and mineralized plankton (e.g. calcareous), causing faster sinking of organic matter and deepening of the oxycline (Lu et al., 2018). However, the anticipated increase in Ce anomaly values during 400\u2013200\u00a0Ma has not been observed in our compilation. Instead, the mean values (and mean negative values) gradually decrease, followed by a slight increase (Fig. 13b, d). This apparent discrepancy may reflect the difference in redox chemistry between iodine and cerium. The iodate concentrations are typically low above the OMZ due to the slow oxidation kinetics of iodide to iodate (e.g. Hardisty et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2020), whereas Ce oxidation to a large extent is kinetically controlled by Mn oxide and is readily oxidized above the OMZ (e.g. Ohta and Kawabe, 2001). Observations in the modern ocean indicate that although Ce anomaly values increase significantly across the top of the OMZ, the values continue decreasing above the OMZ and in the deep part of the OMZ (e.g. De Baar et al., 1985; German and Elderfield, 1990b). That said, the sedimentary Ce anomaly may be less sensitive than iodate content to the development of OMZ. On the other hand, more efficient particle scavenging would generally lead to significant LREE depletion in seawater, which would be more obvious in the shallow marine realm (e.g. Sholkovitz et al., 1994; Kamber et al., 2014; Behrens et al., 2018). Statistical analysis suggests that the mean values of PrN\/YbN in the shallow marine environment decrease from 0.51 during 400\u2013200\u00a0Ma to 0.44 (0.38 if including modern seawater samples) during 200\u20130\u00a0Ma and are statistically different (t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, p values <0.05). Therefore, it seems that ocean biogeochemistry might indeed have been influenced by the evolution of calcareous plankton as evidenced by PrN\/YbN ratios.\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe have reviewed REE systematics in seawater and a wide range of authigenic sedimentary rocks through Earth history. In addition, we have investigated the REE distribution patterns in bulk mudstones with emphasis on the potential effects of weathering on shale Ce anomalies and the meaning of Ce anomalies in shales. The magnitude of negative Ce anomalies can be diminished or intensified in weathered soils, but comparative studies between slightly (or moderately) weathered and unweathered shales show that Ce anomalies are not significantly altered during weathering. We suggest that negative Ce anomalies, where evident, should normally be a primary feature of shales that was likely inherited during early diagenetic organic degradation or directly from authigenic phases. In a case study of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in South China, we show that negative Ce anomalies in the Member IV\/Miaohe siliceous shales, unaffected by diagenesis and weathering, are related to authigenic silica and organic matter, which could be indicative of oxic conditions in the overlying water column. Given the wide occurrence of mudstones in geological records, their REE patterns and authigenic phases within them show great promise for tracing the geochemical evolution of ancient oceans.\nOrganic matter REE patterns, instead of displaying negative Ce anomalies only, exhibit various shapes with different kinds of Ce anomalies. We propose three possibilities to explain this, including: 1) organic matter sourced from different organisms comprising different REE patterns and Ce anomalies, 2) REE fractionation in organic matter during early diagenesis through to catagenesis and\/or metagenesis, 3) REE addition\/loss during sample preparation and digestion. More studies on these aspects will help refine the usefulness of Ce anomalies as a redox proxy and advance our understanding of its REE behaviour during geological processes.\nA sedimentary Ce anomaly compilation through Earth's history is reported. The Ce anomalies mainly vary between 0.8 and 1.2 during the Archean, most of which could be caused by normalisation and analytical artefacts. Rarely reported significant Ce anomalies may suggest the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis during 3.0\u20132.5\u00a0Ga, but this needs to be confirmed by Ce depletion dating using the La-Ce isotopic system. Mean negative Ce anomalies gradually decrease from 2.5 to 2.1\u00a0Ga, consistent with a rise of oxygen levels in the early Paleoproterozoic through an extended Great Oxidation Episode. Modern-like negative Ce anomalies, together with high \u03b4238U and \u03b498Mo values, indicate a potential oxygenation event at ca. 2.0\u00a0Ga. Our compilation also reveals a gradual decreasing trend of mean negative Ce anomalies from 1.8 to 1.2\u00a0Ga, implying that in addition to transient oxygenation events, there might have been a long-term rise in maximal oxygen levels during this interval.\nInterpreting Ce anomaly trends using a published thermodynamic equilibrium model of Ce oxidation indicates that atmospheric oxygen levels ranged above 1\u20136% PAL during much of the Mesoproterozoic Era. Statistical analysis of Ce anomalies implies further progressive oxygenation from the late Tonian to the early Cambrian. Pronounced negative Ce anomalies in shallow marine settings across the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition suggest well oxygenated conditions, while the deep ocean remained largely anoxic, consistent with the persistence of an enlarged DOC reservoir that acted as a redox buffer. A trend to less negative Ce anomalies in the early Paleozoic is consistent with previously reported expansion of ocean anoxia. Although the anoxia could have resulted in increased LREE\/MREE concentrations in anoxic seawater, the hat-shaped REE patterns in Paleozoic phosphorites were more likely caused by prolonged diagenetic exchange with pore waters. Pervasive and sustained ocean oxygenation was probably not achieved until middle Devonian times, potentially related to the evolution of secondary woody tissues and forests. The evolution of calcareous plankton in the Jurassic might have further modified the ocean biochemistry as supported by decreasing PrN\/YbN ratios. Overall, our results indicate that the marine sedimentary Ce anomaly responds sensitively to oceanic redox changes and is a reliable proxy to track Earth system evolution.\n\n","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGlacial lakes have become a widespread phenomenon in glacierised mountains on Earth due to glacier retreat since the Little Ice Age (P\u00f6rtner et al., 2019; Shugar et al., 2020). They are an integral element of the mountain landscape, characteristic of the Earth's mountain systems located in different latitudes and different continents (Liestol, 1956; Lliboutry et al., 1977; Ives et al., 2010; Dokukin and Khatkutov, 2016; Wangchuk and Bolch, 2020). These water bodies have attracted particular attention because in particular moraine-dammed glacial lakes (MGLs) are likely to discharge which can lead to catastrophic floods and glacial mudflows causing casualties and material damage (Ives et al., 2010; Carrivick and Tweed, 2016; Dokukin and Khatkutov, 2016; Kapitsa et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2019).\nMGLs typically develop and increase in size concomitant with the retreat of their parent glaciers. Glaciers in the central Asian Tien Shan shrank and lost mass significantly during recent decades (e.g. Sorg et al., 2012; Farinotti et al., 2015; Severskiy et al., 2016; Shean et al., 2020; Bhattacharya et al., 2021) in line with the reported global glacier retreat (Gardner et al., 2013; Zemp et al., 2019; Hugonnet et al., 2021). Hence, the number and surface area of glacial lakes has increased in the Tien Shan (Wang et al., 2013) as in most mountain ranges on Earth (Shugar et al., 2020; Clague and Evans, 2000; Buckel et al., 2018; Dokukin and Khatkutov, 2016; Gardelle et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2017; Bolch et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Glacier retreat in the South-East Kazakhstan has caused the formation of numerous MGL (e.g. Narama et al., 2009; Bolch et al., 2011). Sudden discharge from these lakes caused frequent MGL outbursts and glacial debris-flow events in this region (Medeu et al., 2018).\nThe first signs of glacial lake formation processes in Ile Alatau began between the 1910s and the 1930s (Palgov, 1958 and references therein). Strong glacier recession, and the concomitant emergence and further development of MGLs occurred in the middle of the 20th century. In the late 1950 investigations of MGL started in the glacierised mountains of Kazakhstan, which includes the western and north-eastern ridges of Tien Shan, Zhetisu (Dzungarian) Alatau, Saur and Kazakhstan's Altai (Popov, 1991; Medeu et al., 2018). In recent decades, these processes have been most active and studied in the Karakoram-Hindu Kush-Himalaya mountains (Cenderelli and Wohl, 2001; Richardson and Reynolds, 2000; Wang and Zhang, 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Allen et al., 2019; Veh et al., 2019). Several models with various complexity have been suggested and applied to model the outburst flood from glacial lakes and its peak discharge (Westoby et al., 2014).\nDifferent definitions of glacial lakes and moraine-dammed glacial lakes exist (e.g., Glaciological Dictionary, 1984; Kotlyakov and Komarova, 2012; Emmer, 2017). In our study we consider all types of lakes located within the extent of the moraines of the Little Ice Age (~1500\u20131859 CE) (Glaciological Dictionary, 1984). These zones, called \u201cmodern moraine-glacial complexes\u201d in the Russian scientific literature, include the open parts of the glaciers and frontal or lateral moraines containing ice cores. In this study we focus on glacial lakes which form(ed) when the terminal moraine has prevented meltwater from leaving moraine-glacial complex. We thus use the general term moraine-dammed glacial lakes (MGL). The term \u201cGlacial Lake Outburst Flood, (GLOF)\u201d is commonly used to describe the sudden release of water held in glacial lakes dammed by glacial ice or moraines. In a broad sense, the term GLOF does not differentiate between types of lakes, genesis, and features of their hydrological regimes and mechanisms of drainage (Grabs and Hanish, 1993, Reynolds, 1995; Clague and O'Connor, 2015; Emmer, 2017).\nThe main aims of this study are to (a) review the existing knowledge about the occurrence of MGLs and GLOFs in South-East Kazakhstan, (b) evaluate the history of MGL research and preventative measures in Kazakhstan and put them into perspective of current knowledge and research, (c) present various mechanisms of MGL discharge, particularly determining the maximum (peak) discharge rates, which allows the assessment of their potential hazard, to (d) demonstrate preventive work to reduce glacial debris flow hazards, and to (e) suggest future direction of research.\n\n\n2\nStudy Region\n\n2.1\nLocation and general characteristics\nOur study focuses on the mountains of South-East Kazakhstan (Qazaqstan according to the new Latin alphabet), located close to the border to Kyrgyzstan which includes the Ile (former name: Zailiskiy) Alatau ridge and the northern slope of the Kungei Alatau within 76\u201378\u00b0E and 42.8\u201343.3\u00b0N covering an area of about 4000\u00a0km2 (Fig. 1\n). There are 11 glacierised river basins in our study area: Uzunkargaly, Chemolgan, Kaskelen, Aksai, Kargaly, Ulken (Bolshaya, Big) and Kishi (Malaya, Small) Almaty, Talgar, Esik, Turgen River basins on the northern slope of the Ile Alatau ridge, as well as the Shilek (Chilik) River basin (between the southern slope of Ile and the northern slope of Kungei Alatau).\nThe average elevation of the mountain ridges is 3800\u20134200\u00a0m above sea level (asl.). The ridges connect in their central part (Shilek-Keminsky mountain junction), where the highest point \u2013 Pik Talgar (4973\u00a0m asl.) \u2013 is located. The ancient sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks of Lower Paleozoic dominate in the region (sandstones, porphyries, granites and gneisses). During the Alpine orogeneses this mountainous structure became folded. Piedmont and intermountain territories are formed of Neogene and Quaternary sediments complexes, which are of glacial, alluvial and proluvial-diluvial origin.\nThe climate of northern Tien Shan is semi-continental and influenced by circulation processes that extend to Kazakhstan and Western Siberia. The main features are strong solar radiation and the complex seasonal nature of precipitation. In the foothills and mid-mountain zone, the climate is temperate-continental with the highest precipitation occurring in April and May due to cyclonic activities while in the high-mountain zone precipitation high precipitation occurs from April through August governed by convective precipitation and north-western cold air intrusions (Aizen et al., 1995). Mean annual air temperature at Tuyuksu Glacier station (3434\u00a0m asl.), located slightly lower than the glacier terminus, is about \u22123.3\u00a0\u00b0C with mean annual precipitation of about 1100\u00a0mm.\nPermafrost is widespread over the whole study area and covers a significantly greater area than the regions glaciers (Bolch and Gorbunov, 2014). The lower boundary of the discontinuous permafrost is located between 2700 and 3000\u00a0m asl. While above 3600\u00a0m asl. Permafrost occurs in almost all conditions (Gorbunov et al., 1996; Bolch and Gorbunov, 2014). Hence, the modern moraines are located in elevations where permafrost occurrence is likely.\n\n\n2.2\nPast glacier and permafrost changes\nIn recent decades, the glaciers in the Ile and Kungei Alatau mountains have lost more than a third of their area. The observed glacier retreat was the most pronounced in the Kazakh part of Ile and Kungei Alatau (Bolch, 2007; Severskiy et al., 2016; Vilesov, 2018). Vilesov (2018) revealed, based on multitemporal glacier inventories derived from aerial images and satellite data, that glaciers in South-East Kazakhstan shrank more than 40% (from about 1775\u00a0km2 to ~1030\u00a0km2) between 1955 and 2015. The total number of glaciers decreased from 2793 to 2054; while larger glaciers disintegrated and small glaciers with an area of less than 1\u00a0km2 disappeared (Vilesov, 2018). In general, during the period 1955 to 2008, glacier area decreased from 287.3\u00a0km2 to 171.5\u00a0km2, or by about 40% on the northern slope of the Ile Alatau. In Shilek River basin in the territory of Kazakhstan, the number of glaciers increased from 257 to 271 in the period from 1955 to 2005, while the glacier area decreased from about 287\u00a0km2 to ~207\u00a0km2, respectively (Vilesov, 2018). In-situ and geodetic mass balance measurements revealed that the tongue of Tuyuksu Glacier, located in Kishi Almaty basin, thinned by more than 70\u00a0m between 1958 and 2016. The mass loss rate of Tuyuksu Glacier was about 0.37\u00a0m water equivalent per annum (w.e. a\u22121) over this time period (Kapitsa et al., 2020). Ground temperature measurements, established in the 1970s at Zhusalykezen Pass (altitude ~3300\u00a0m asl.) located close to Ulken Almaty basin showed a rise in permafrost temperatures between 0.3 and 0.6\u00a0\u00b0C and an increase in active-layer thickness of more than 20% (Marchenko et al., 2007; Bolch and Marchenko, 2009).\n\n\n\n3\nPast and present-day data and methods to study moraine-dammed lakes and their outbursts in South-East Kazakhstan\nThe following sections provide more details about the history of past and more recent work.  An overview of the work conducted and the general workflow of the investigations of the MGLs to identify hazardous and dangerous glacial lakes is presented in Fig. 2.\n\n3.1\nRemote sensing-based investigations\nThe first important step is to identify the location of the glacial lakes and then to investigate their characteristics and changes over time. This can be best achieved with remote sensing data.\n\n3.1.1\nIdentification and evolution of moraine-dammed glacial lakes\nThe MGLs in our study were visually identified and manually mapped by various organizations (especially the Hydro-Meteorological Service of the Kazakh SSR\/Kazakhstan [Kazhydromet], the Kazakhstan Debris Flow Protection Organization [Kazselezashchita] and the Institute of Geography, Almaty) at different periods of time. The earliest complete inventory exists for 1968\/69 and the lakes were mapped from aerial images (Tokmagambetov et al., 1980). The inventory was displayed on simple maps and the information about the lake position and area handwritten in tables. Further inventories based on aerial images exist for some periods in the 1980s. At a later stage satellite images were used. Scientists from the Institute of Geography manually delineated the lake boundaries and generated the inventories based on satellite imagery and GIS software. The satellite images used includes Landsat TM\/ETM+ (spatial resolution 30\u00a0m) for ~1990 and 2000 and Sentinel-2 (10\u00a0m) for 2018. The lake outlines were compared to conducted field measurements of the margins of selected lakes (see Section 3.2). The mapped outlines showed a good fit to the measured ones.\n\n\n3.1.2\nDam characteristics and past outburst events\nRemote sensing data and in particular high-resolution aerial images have been used to obtain relevant further information to estimate the potential hazard of a glacial lake and to support the calculation of peak discharge. The obtained information includes the width of the moraine dam and the frontal moraine slope (the latter was obtained in earlier time with the support of small-scale topographic maps and later using digital elevation models) and identification of evidence of the type of drainage (via surface channels or tunnels). The conducted field investigations supported the remote-sensing-based investigations in particular for better identification of the drainage types.\n\n\n\n3.2\nField investigations\nField investigations can provide detailed information about the characteristics of MGLs, their surroundings and their evolution. However, these investigations are laborious and not all glacial lakes can be reached. In the earlier days the lakes investigated were selected based on past outburst events, later the investigations were further guided by the interpretation of aerial photos or satellite images.\n\n3.2.1\nCharacteristics of the glacial lakes and moraine dams\nThe earliest field measurements were conducted on lakes No. 2 and 6 in Kishi Almaty (for the location see Figs. 3 and 4\n\n) by Institute of Geography (E. Vilesov, P. Cherkasov) during the international geophysical year (1956\/57). The general characteristics of the lakes and their damming moraines were inspected. It was known from previous lake outburst and debris flow events (e.g. 20.08.1951 and 7.8.1956, Kavetsky and Smirnov, 1957; Kolotilin, 1959) that these lakes are a direct threat to the city of Almaty and moreover they could be relatively easily accessed. The first total station and bathymetric surveys of glacial lakes and water-retaining dams were conducted in 1968\u20131969 by Kazhydromet. Total station surveys were performed according to the established requirements for building plans and maps at scales 1:1000, 1:500 and larger, in conventional coordinates using theodolites of the type TT-2, TT-3 (Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant, 1954\u20131967). During the 1970s -1990s total station surveys were performed by employees of Kazselezashchita, Kazhydromet and the Institute of Geography (with the participation of N. Popov, A. Medeu and V. Blagovechshensky) employing T-30 and T-15 instruments (Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant, 1973\u20131979) with the use of range finders, levelling and total tachometer staff. Hydrological posts were established by Kazselezashchita on several lakes to monitor the water level and the temperature regime. A level survey of the installed heads of piles or water gauges was performed with NV-1 levels, or devices similar in accuracy. Bathymetric surveys of selected MGLs were performed simultaneously with total stations and levellers by employees of Kazselezashchita and the Institute of Geography. The depth at the pivot points was measured using lots. Most of the measurements were made from inflatable boats, approximately at equal fixed intervals in time and distance. The average total measurement error was in the range of 10\u201320%. This relatively small error was achieved by a high accuracy of depth measurement, usually less than 0.1\u00a0m, as well as by increasing the number of measurements.\nLakes No. 2 and 6 in Kishi Almaty and selected further MGLs have been consistently investigated since 2000 by employees of Kazselezashchita and the Institute of Geography (with the participation of A. Medeu, V. Blagovechshensky, N. Kasatkin and V. Kapitsa). The accuracy of measurements of both the geodetic work and bathymetric surveys has increased in accordance with new measurement devices. For tachometric surveys, modern devices 2\u00a0T-30, 2\u00a0T-30P and other nomogram tachometers TN, DALTA-010; DALTA-020 were used between 2005 and 2017. For the depth measurement the Lowrance LMS 480\u00a0m echo sounder, with an operating frequency of 200\u00a0kHz and equipped with a 12-channel GPS receiver, was applied (with a depth measurement error of up to 10\u00a0cm). In 2017, a portable 24-channel Garmin GPSMAP 64 receiver was used for more accurate positioning.\n\n\n3.2.2\nObservations and characteristics of past outburst events\nAll past MGL outburst events which could be clearly determined (e.g. due to flood and debris flows observed at the edge of the mountains) were recorded by since about 1950 by Kazhydromet, Kazselezashchita and the Institute of Geography. Few earlier events which had a large impact on the infrastructure or caused fatalities were also recoded. In particular for catastrophic events, field investigations were conducted to explore the reasons for the flash floods and debris flows. In case of MGL outbursts the dam characteristics were investigated. Within this study all available literature and the related information therein were considered. Several of these references were published by authors of this study (see also Section 4.3).\nIn a few cases the lowering of the lake water level during its emptying could be observed. Observations were made in particular for the glacial lake close to Tuyuksu Glacier (Lake no. 2) on July 15, 1973, Lake no. 17 close to Zharsai Glacier on July 3, 1977, Lake no. 13 close to Soviets Glacier on August 3, 1977, and Bogatyr Lake on July 23, 1985 (Golubev, 1974; Plekhanov et al., 1975; Keremkulov and Tsukerman, 1984; Keremkulov, 1985; Popov, 1986b). These measurements, along with field investigations of the outburst mechanism, the drainage channels or tunnels and discharge measurements at hydrological posts downstream, were instrumental to be able to calculate, calibrate and validate the empirical formulas of the peak discharge (see 3.3.2).\n\n\n\n3.3\nEmpirical formulations and modelling\n\n3.3.1\nEstimation of lake volumes\nThe estimation of the volumes of glacial lakes based on the empirical relationship between the lake area and its volume is well established (e.g. Huggel et al., 2002; Cook and Quincey, 2015). However, it needs to be noted that the applied formulas can provide large erroneous values for individual lakes and should be adjusted to the specific conditions of the study regions. The conducted bathymetric measurements of several lakes in the study region allowed Popov (1986b, 1988) to establish the following formula between the volumes and areas of lakes for South-East Kazakhstan:\n\n(1)\n\nV\n=\n0.059\n\n\nS\n1.44\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere V is the volume of the lake in m3 and S the lake area in m2.\nThis formula was used to estimate the volume of lakes in the presented studies of the study region and previous work in case no bathymetric measurements were available for the particular lake.\nFor the lakes where measurements of the depth available, the following more detailed formula was used (Keremkulov, 1985):\n\n(2)\n\nV\n=\n0\n,\n09\n\n\nS\nmax\n\n0\n,\n10\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n2\n,\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\nS\n=\n0\n,\n21\n\nS\nmax\n\n0\n,\n13\n\n\n\nh\n\n1\n,\n51\n\n\n\n\nwhere Smax - is the maximum area of the lake, 103 m2;\nh - is the depth of the lake, m;\nS - is the estimated area of the lake, 103 m2.\n\n\n3.3.2\nEstimation of peak discharges\nAn important element in assessing the lake outburst hazard is the condition for maximum (peak) discharge. A large lake outburst flood serves as a trigger for glacial debris flows which can cause even stronger destructions that the flood waves. The peak discharge depends besides the lake volume in particular also on the characteristics of the discharge mechanisms. The main discharge mechanisms in our study area are (a) discharge via open channels formed in the moraine dam, (b) discharge via underground tunnels through the moraines (\u201cpiping\u201d), and (c) discharge via ruptures in thawed permafrost bodies.\nVarious methods exist to estimate the peak water discharge during lake drainage based on water volume and the time of water out-flow from the lake, most widely applied are empirical-statistical models (e.g. Clague and Mathews, 1973; Costa and Schuster, 1988; Westoby et al., 2014 and references therein). Further models include more specific information such as cross sectional area or the slope angle for the frontal moraine or were developed the different drainage types and triggers (e.g. Haeberli, 1983; Costa and Schuster, 1988). These models require direct measurements or observations which are mostly unavailable since lake outburst events are rare phenomena. However, few observations are available also for our study region (see Section 3.1.2). These observations allowed the determination of the time taken for water drainage, to obtain peak flow values as well as to calculate hydrographs of the MGL drainage in SE-Kazakhstan. Important parameters which can be considered without direct measurements but obtained from high-resolution remote sensing data are cross-sectional area and hydrostatic pressure in the channel, which depends on the height difference between MGL water horizon and tunnel outlet (Popov, 1984; Keremkulov and Tsukerman, 1985; Bizhanov et al., 1998; Medeu et al., 2015). The following two formulars for discharge via open channels and tunnels were applied by the authors for the study region (Table 1\n).\nEq. (5) is suitable for discharge via open channels and was calibrated using field measurements in the study region (Popov, 1986b). The proposed model by Clague and Mathews (1973) (6) of lake discharge via tunnels in the ice-cored moraines include the maximum volume of the lake, and thus model its emptying as quasi-instantaneous (flash flood). Eq. (7) is a modification of the widely used hydraulic correlations between water pressure and the cross-sectional area of the pressure pipe.\n\n\n\n3.4\nIdentification and classification of potentially hazardous and dangerous moraine-dammed glacial lakes\nThe information obtained from field investigations, remote sensing and from the empirical estimations allowed the identification of hazardous (lakes with a high outburst susceptibility) and dangerous lakes (as defined in our study by being hazardous and have high probability of debris-flow as determined by the water volume and the peak discharge) (Fig. 2).\nThe main hazard criteria in the framework of older studies included only the volume of water and the \u201cstrength of water-retaining bulkhead\u201d, which was determined visually based on the interpretation of aerial images and selected field investigations (Popov, 1991). A further simple classification was proposed by Baimoldayev and Vinokhodov (2007) who distinguished \u201cdangerous\u201d, \u201cpotentially dangerous\u201d and \u201cnon-dangerous\u201d lakes among the non-stationary and stationary reservoirs. Their criteria for this qualitative classification of MGLs were only the water volume, features of the hydrological regime and the past outburst activity.\nA more sophisticated classification was developed by Popov (1997) and Bizhanov et al. (1998) and was further refined by Kapitsa et al. (2018) and Medeu et al. (2018) based on the results of field studies carried out in the 1990s and 2000s, as well as the examination of aerial photographs and satellite images.\nThe hazard criteria used included the following:\n\n\u2022\nPresence of precedents for earlier discharges while maintaining the possibility of filling the lake depression.\n\n\n\u2022\nIntense lake development expressed as an increase in area and volume of the water.\n\n\n\u2022\nA sharp modification in the water regime of the lake (expressed in a sharp drop \/ rise of the water level, the occurrence of subsidence on the underground runoff paths, and rapid filling of previously empty lake hollows).\n\n\n\u2022\nSignificant changes in the moraine-glacial lake system, causing damage to the integrity of the water-retaining dam, changes in filtration paths and underground flow.\n\n\n\nTaking the past investigations, existing literature and the knowledge of past outburst events into account, we used the following indicators to characterize the outburst susceptibility (the hazard level) of the MGLs (Table 2\n).\nThese indicators include indicators for occurrence of debris flows which are usually more dangerous due to the large volume of material they are transporting. Important factors are the availability of large amount of debris either from the dam (indicator 8) or in the channel below the lake (9). Furthermore, the water volume of the lake and possible peak discharge is important as a certain strength is needed to be able to transport the debris. The debris flows of categories 1, 2, 3 (indicator 10) are natural events that (1) occurred within the moraine-glacial complexes only, (2) which reached the mid-mountain zone and (3) the foothills. We consider lakes as potentially dangerous if they are hazardous and they have the potential to generate a large debris flow which could reach the foothills of the mountains. They are identified by the water volume, the peak discharge and the strength of water-retaining dam. The potentially dangerous MGLs were investigated and if a potential outburst could have a large impact infrastructure or cause fatalities mitigation measures were conducted. The lakes where mitigation measures have been conducted were selected by expert judgment and costs.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nInventories of moraine-dammed glacial lakes\nWithin the first inventory carried out by the KazHydromet, 128 glacial lakes were identified on the northern slopes of the Ile Alatau (cf. Fig. 3) between 1968 and 1969 (Popov, 1991). Our own inventory for 1990 based on Landsat TM data revealed 148 MGLs (total area 2.13\u00a0km2). In 2018, using Sentinel-2 data, more than 160 MGLs (2.38\u00a0km2) were found in our whole study area despite the fact the several MGLs drained (Figs. 3 and 4).\nIn general, available data on MGLs shows that the 1970\u20131980s saw intense lake development. This period further coincided with a strong increase of their outburst activity (see Section 4.4). The lake number and area has been further growing until today. At the present time a number of lakes have expanded substantially: for example, the lake near the Mining Institute Glacier in the Turgen River basin and the lake at Maksimova Glacier in Shilik River basin (cf. Fig. 5\n), where measurements of Kazselezashchita and the Institute of Geography, Almaty revealed a volume of water of about 1.5\u00a0million m3.\nIn order to get information about lake abundance as well as their evolution, we calculated the ratio of lakes with an area of more than 5000\u00a0m2 and the area of glacier cover (Table 3). Glacier area is based on the years of the closest available glacier inventory for the whole region (1990 and 2008). The lake ratios show that the lake formation in the study region is progressing intensively, especially in the intra-mountainous basin of the Shilek River. This basin lagged behind in the previous period in the development of lakes in comparison to the northern slope of Ile Alatau (Table 3\n).\n\n\n4.2\nCharacteristics of the evolution of moraine-dammed glacial lakes\nThe detailed measurements of area and depth, along with further field investigations, allowed for insights into the specific characteristics of the evolution of MGLs. At the first stage, increase in lake extents mainly results from the retreat of surrounding glaciers; lake depths, however, remained relatively stable. At the next stage the lake volume increased with a depth increase due to activation of thermokarst processes and melting of ice beneath the lake. In this case, the depths of the studied lakes were 10\u201315\u00a0m on average, but can reach up to 30\u00a0m (Palgov, 1958). Alternatively, MGL development is initiated by the appearance of supraglacial lakes favoured by debris-cover which expand and then merge. Eventually these lakes can evolve into MGL with further development of the MGL according to a similar scenario as for lakes that form at glacier termini. This process, which is common in the Himalaya (cf. Benn et al., 2012), is, however, an exception in the Kazakh Tien Shan according to our observations.\nSome lakes drained or outburst once they reached a critical area and depth. After one or a series of outbursts the lakes disappeared. The bed of some of these drained lakes were filled with glacial alluvial sediment (e.g., lakes No. 2, No. 3 in Kishi Almaty basin, No. 13, No. 14 in Ulken Almaty basin, and Bogatyr Lake in the Shilek basin, cf. Fig. 5).\nFrom this, we can identify a dichotomy in MGL behaviour:\nThere are (a) stationary lakes with consistent water levels for a long time and (b) non-stationary lakes which form and drain regularly.\nThe former are usually lying at lower hypsometric levels, on the upper Quaternary grass-covered moraine surfaces. They typically produce no outbursts during their development and have retained a substantial part of the water volume since their emergence. Runoff from the lake occurs mainly through developed surface channels through the crest of modern moraines. A typical example of a stationary moraine-dammed glacial lake is Bogatyr Lake, located at the glacier of the same name in the upper reaches of the Shilek River at an altitude of 3450\u00a0m asl. (Fig. 4). Since the emergence of shallow depressions filled with water on the surface of the modern moraine in the 1940s, the volume of water of the lake has grown from 3.4 million m3 in 1972 to 9.3 million m3 in 1985 (Fig. 5).\nIn contrast, non-stationary lakes are temporary. The depression formed behind the modern moraine may not dam the glacier melt waters, as it can drain using the underground drainage system (tunnels) inherited from the glacier. In such a situation, the formed basin remains empty for many years and fills occasionally, usually for a short time at the beginning of ablation period. Such temporarily occurring MGLs can be classified as non-stationary lakes. Typical examples are Lake No. 16 (Kaskelen), Lake No. 17 (Esik), Lake No. 5 (Left Talgar), Lake No. 7 and Lake No. 8 (Middle Talgar), Lake No. 8 (K. Almaty) and Lake No. 1 (Kargaly).\nOngoing glacier retreat typically leads to the emergence of overdeepenings. These became, in our study region, the core of future lake formation at the next high-level hypsometric stage. A typical example is the upper Kumbelsu River. The single glacier disintegrated into several small glaciers. One former tributary now terminates about 90\u00a0m higher where Lake \u211613b (cf. Fig. 3) developed intensively (Fig. 6\n).\n\n\n4.3\nPast moraine-dammed glacial lake outburst events\n\n4.3.1\nGeneral characteristics of past outburst events\nOverall, 48 GLOF events in the Ile Alatau (northern and southern slopes) were documented which occurred between 1951 and 2019 (Fig. 7\n), an average of 0.7 GLOF events per year.\nIf we assume that approximately 100 to 120 potentially hazardous MGLs were present in the northern slope of Ile Alatau during this period, it is likely that the probability of a random GLOF event in the study region does not exceed 0.5\u20130.6% per year (Kavetsky and Smirnov, 1957; Gerasimov, 1978; Vinogradov, 1977; Popov, 1986a; Medeu et al., 2018).\nThe temporal distribution of GLOF events (Fig. 7) revealed a high outburst activity between 1970 and 2000 with most GLOFs occurring between 1970 and 1985. The GLOF frequency has been lower from 2000 to the present with the lowest number between 2000 and 2010.\nA further important finding of the analysis of well documented past outburst events in the Ile Alatau is that they occurred in the warm period of the year, starting from the end of June to August (Table 4\n).\nFrom these 25 documented GLOF events, nine had a volume up to 30,000\u00a0m3, seven a volume between 30,000 and 100,000\u00a0m3 and nine had a volume greater than 100,000\u00a0m3.\nOverall, outbursts of 9 MGLs led to the formation of glacial debris flows (Table 5, Figs. 3 and 4). Some of which are attributed to the largest debris flows, accompanied by numerous casualties (1963, 1973, 1977; Plekhanov et al., 1975, 1977, Popov, 1978, Bizhanov et al., 1998). It should be noted that despite the comparatively small number of the indicated lakes, many MGLs classified as dangerous drained repeatedly (Table 5).\nWhile some precursory stages exist (typically the so called \u201cstage of readiness\u201d), they are rarely identified prior to the outburst. Below, we present information on the prerequisites and conditions observed during the documented outbursts of some MGLs. In addition, we clarify the date and time of outbursts, as well as quantitative characteristics of floods and the consequences of these outbursts (Table 5\n).\nSince 2010 only three large debris flow events which reached the forelands of the mountains occurred after GLOFs:\n\n\u2022\nIn 2014 based on a GLOF of Lake \u21168 in Middle Talgar River. A previous outburst of this lake took place in 1993 (Baimoldayev and Vinokhodov, 2007).\n\n\n\u2022\nIn 2015 based on a GLOF of Lake \u21161 in Kargaly River basin (Medeu et al., 2018).\n\n\n\u2022\nIn 2019 again based on a GLOF of Lake \u21161 in Kargaly River basin in 2019 (this study, Kazselezashita pers. comm.).\n\n\n\nThese recent events show that glacial debris flow hazards emanating from MGLs in the region remains high. This is likely due to ongoing glacier recession leading to intensive growth of the lake volumes, and the refilling of empty lake basins.\n\n\n4.3.2\nDetailed examples of selected outburst events\nSeveral MGL drained due to overflow of an ice-cored moraine since the late 1970s. Earlier, similar phenomena were not observed in the study area. Such drainages were most likely not detected due to their relatively low magnitude and low level of resulting damage. The maximum discharge events are formed by about half time of the complete lake drainage.\nMGL draining via open channels were observed in four cases (for the location see Fig. 4):\n\n\u2022\nLake \u211617 at Zharsay Glacier in Esik River basin (1977),\n\n\n\u2022\nLake \u21168 at Igly Tuyuksu Glacier (Fig. 8B) in Kishi Almaty River basin (1981),\n\n\n\u2022\nLake \u21165 at Kalesnik Glacier (Fig. 8A) in the Left Talgar River basin (1984),\n\n\n\u2022\nBogatyr Lake in Shilik River basin (1985).\n\n\n\nIn the latter case, emptying of the lake via an open channel was caused artificially (Section 5). Fig. 8\n provides insights into the characteristics of these outlet channels.\nMGL drainage via ice tunnels is more dangerous and the most common mechanism for the discharge in our study area. The lakes are drained underground, using previously existing (inherited) drainage channels to discharge water. For non-stationary MGLs the drainage system is often composed of ice tunnels through which meltwater drained for many years. Short-term filling of the basins occurs in case of blockages of such underground drainage channels, leading to the formation of a lake. According to observations, outbursts are accompanied by noise, the release of water and boulders on the outer slopes of the dam, indicating a pressurized water outflow during lake drainage. A peak in water discharge in the initial phase is characteristic for such outburst events. The time needed to drain the water rarely exceeds several hours. Examples of GLOFs through ice tunnels are: 1993, Lake N\u00b0 7 in Middle Talgar basin; 2014, Lake N\u00b0 8 in Kargaly basin; 2015 and 2019, Lake N\u00b0 1 in Kargaly basin (Medeu et al., 2015).\nMGL discharge via ruptures in thawing permafrost bodies of modern moraines is the most dangerous of the three discharge mechanisms, as they likely lead to the formation of a powerful outburst flood wave. Catastrophic discharge of glacial lakes above ground level due to destruction of lake dams are known in various mountainous regions of the Earth (Haeberli, 1983; Clague and Evans, 2000; Richardson and Reynolds, 2000; Emmer and Vil\u00edmek, 2013). It should be noted that cases of ice or debris mass movements into lakes, which are quite characteristic for the Cordillera (South American Andes), Karakoram-Hindukush-Himalayas, are not widespread for the Ile and Kungei Alatau study region.\nThe debris flow catastrophe in Kishi Almaty River on 15th July 1973, which caused significant material damage and human casualties, was caused by the outburst via dam rupture of Lake N\u00b02 at Central Tuyuksu Glacier. A powerful flood wave with a peak flow rate of about 250\u2013350\u00a0m3\/s occurred via a rupture in the lake dam and the flow rate was more than two orders of magnitude higher than the average surface runoff from the glacier (Plekhanov et al., 1977; Vinogradov, 1977). Accordingly, rapid destruction of lake dam took place with formation of a 30-m-wide rupture in the upper part.\nHowever, these studies did not consider the fact that a few years before the outburst, there was a deep, well-defined channel in the dam of the lake at the site of rupture which developed by surface and filtration runoff in the direction of a underlying small lake (Lake \u21163). This can be clearly identified in a photograph taken in 1970 (Fig. 9A, from Duysenov Duysenov, 1971). Consequently, the water of MGL \u21162 discharged via a rupture, which formed in the weakest part of the dam, on the site of a previously existing drainage channel and thawed core, which was affected by surface water for several years before the outburst.\nA similar process caused the catastrophic discharge of MGL \u211613 at Soviets Glacier in the upper Ulken Almaty River. After the outburst, it became apparent that the 15\u201320\u00a0m deep rupture exposed thawed material, covered with a 1.5\u00a0m layer of frozen rocks. The ice core in the lake dam was also absent (Fig. 9B).\nThe data shows that understanding the processes of formation and further development of MGLs is more than urgent at present. This is consistent with the ongoing context of documented general glacier shrinkage. It should be noted that, despite an increase in the number of MGLs, their total outburst activity has on average decreased during the last two decades.\n\n\n\n4.4\nEvaluation of equations applied in South-East Kazakhstan to calculate peak discharges\nExisting data from past outburst events in Kazakhstan enabled us to apply and evaluate the different equations used to calculate peak discharge (Table 1). In this study we used the characteristic hydrographs for lake discharge via open channels which are based on direct observations of water level decreases of Lake \u211617 at Zharsay Glacier in 1977 and Lake \u21165 at the Kalesnik Glacier in 1984 (Fig. 10\n).\nThese direct observations showed that for conditions of the Ile Alatau, the maximum values of \u03bb (which correspond to the channel thawing intensity) of Eq. (5) for MGL discharge via open channels (Table 1) are very close to 0.00017\u00a0m\/s (0.612\u00a0m\/h, Popov, 1986b).\nOther available field data allowed further calculations of peak discharge from specific lakes in the Ile Alatau using different equations for outflow via tunnels (Table 1) and to compare their results (Table 6\n). Due to the lack of data on the cross-sectional area of the draining tunnels, the peak discharge during the outbursts of Lake \u2116 16 in the upper Kaskelen River (1980 and 1986) was determined from the hydrographs.\nThe result for Lake no. 7 show that Eq. (6) (Clague and Mathews, 1973) which was widely applied in SE Kazakhstan matches the observations relatively well but might result in some overestimates. Eq. (7) (Medeu et al., 2018) matches the observations equally well but more detailed measurements are needed.\nDue to the lack of data on the cross-sectional area of the draining tunnels, the peak discharge during the outbursts of lake \u2116 16 in the upper Kaskelen River (1980 and 1986) was determined from the hydrographs and only Eq. (6) could be applied. Results show that the calculated values are in the right order of magnitude, but for the one outburst event the peak discharge is overestimated by about 20% while the other event the peak is underestimated by about 14%.\nEq. (8) (Table 1) includes a dimensionless coefficient n, and \u0410* (the resistivity of the main drainage channel). This contains a number of uncertainties such as hydraulic resistance in the area in which the pressure loss is equal to velocity head in the outlet section, depending on the cross-sectional area of the main drainage channel. The resistivity of the drainage system, as assumed to be an ice tunnel, also includes a certain level of uncertainty. Nevertheless, according to the proposed method, calculations of the maximum flow rates and reconstruction of hydrographs of the lake outburst were carried out by Keremkulov and Tsukerman (1985). This allowed the authors to conclude that the shape of constructed hydrographs corresponds to their qualitative description and, in general terms, to the real object and can therefore be used to support the identification of dangerous lakes and preventative mitigation measures.\nHowever, a comparison of calculated and observed hydrographs of discharge for Lake \u211616 shows a clear difference both in form, discharged water volume, and time of discharge (Fig. 11\n).\nEven though the initial data for constructing the different hydrographs were the same, the discrepancies in the observed and modelled hydrographs (Fig. 11) clearly shows the influence of the uncertainties and the shortcomings of the models. In practice, using this equation to model lake discharge does not seem appropriate. To consider this option, a more in-depth knowledge on the cross-sectional area of ice tunnels and hydraulic resistance is required. Such data is, however, rarely available for MGLs.\nNevertheless, the peculiarities of lake discharge via ice tunnels and the shape the hydrograph (Fig. 11) show that a peak at an initial stage can be explained by pressure discharge from the basin. According to the observer, the first stage of emptying of Lake \u211616 was accompanied by appearance of a funnel above the inlet tunnel, approximately 6\u20138\u00a0m in diameter (Popov, 1984). A shallow part of a hydrograph indicates loss of pressure at the tunnel's outflow. Observational data confirms the hypothesis of the formation of a snow and ice plug at the entrance of the drainage tunnels.\nSuch a mechanism requires the formation of a drainage tunnel through a pre-existing dead ice cave and the destruction of the outer wall downstream. Both Lake \u21166 at Glacier TEU-North in the Talgar River basin in 1974, as well as large MGL at Tushinsky Glacier in Zhetisu Alatau in 1982 outburst according to this scheme. In these cases, the roof of the ice tunnel collapsed soon after the outbursts, forming a large open gap of outcropping ice-permafrost slopes (Popov, 1986b; Bizhanov et al., 1998).\n\n\n4.5\nHazardous and dangerous glacial lakes\nAs part of the repeated inventories and lake investigations carried out by Kazselezashchita in Ile Alatau during the 1980s, 18 out of the identified 128 MGLs were assigned to the category of \u201cpotentially debris flow hazardous\u201d (hence dangerous, cf. 3.4, Popov, 1991). All these lakes have also a volume close to or larger than 100,000\u00a0m3. Among the largest are Lake \u211613 (located in Ulken Almaty River basin, with a volume of 138,000\u00a0m3, Lake \u21168 Toguzak (Talgar River) with a volume of 349,000\u00a0m3, and Lake Muzkol (Esik River) with a volume of 97,600\u00a0m3. In the Uzunkargaly-Shilek river basins, 35 dangerous lakes were identified in the 1970s and 1980s, among which were Lake \u211616 (Kaskelen River) with a volume of 248,000\u00a0m3, Lake \u21162 (Aksai River) with a volume of 400,000\u00a0m3, Lake \u211613 with a volume of 232,000\u00a0m3, lakes \u21165 and \u21168 Toguzak (Talgar River) with volumes of 247,000 and 466,000\u00a0m3, respectively, Lake \u211617 (Esik River) and the aforementioned Bogatyr Lake (Shilek River) with a volume of 9.1 million m3. We refer to Fig. 5 for the location of the lakes.\nIn 2018 about 40 lakes out of more than 160 mapped based on the Sentinel-2 satellite scene were identified as dangerous by own investigations using the criteria presented in Table 1. It should be noted that various researchers assessed the outburst hazard and danger of lakes using different criteria. In earlier times the lake volume was the main factor while subsequent studies used more detailed criteria (see 3.4). In Figs. 3 and 4, only lakes classified as potentially dangerous throughout the different periods are marked. The different approaches highlight the need for a reassessment of the MGLs.\n\n\n\n5\nMitigation of moraine-dammed glacial lake outburst hazards: A summary of prevention measures\nThe disastrous lake outburst and debris flow events from the 1950s and 1960s raised the awareness of the government of the Kazakh SSR and early preventive measures regarding MGLs were set up in the 1960s and 1970s by the government. However, such measures were not systematically undertaken and were mainly limited to the use of siphons to reduce water volume in lakes, as well as construction of evacuation trenches in natural outflow channels. The level of Lake \u21162 at Central Tuyuksu Glacier was lowered by two meters in the early 1960s using three siphon pipelines. This was the maximum possible lowering as the achieved height of water rise through the siphons (4\u00a0m) was close to practically achievable under the local conditions. The maximum height of water increase due to atmospheric pressure at sea level is assumed to be around 10\u00a0m, and at an altitude of 3350\u00a0m with an atmospheric pressure of about 590\u00a0hPa, the theoretical height cannot exceed 6\u00a0m. Considering the inevitable losses in siphon pipelines on valves and joints, this height in meters of water column is further reduced by 30%. The achieved lake level decrease did not prevent further lake development and its catastrophic outburst in 1973. Since the depths of large MGLs can reach up to 30\u00a0m, the use of siphons cannot serve as a guaranteed method for eliminating outburst hazard in Kazakhstan.\nThe use of siphons and pumps to lower the water level of MGLs can however be an effective solution when it is combined to other engineering activities. Kazselezashchita has constructed evacuation lines in discharge channels of MGLs via explosions and subsequent \u201cwashout\u201d due to small releases and manual refinement. In this way, the volumes of some stationary MGLs on the northern slope of the Ile Alatau could be partly reduced in the 1970s. Examples are lakes No. 2 and No. 6 in Kishi Almaty River basin, lakes No. 13, No. 1, No. 11, and No. 12 in Ulken Almaty River basin and No. 13 in Kaskelen River basin. It should be noted that these works were carried out without a detailed study of the MGLs hydrological regime and structure of the water-retaining moraine dam.\nHowever, large-scale construction work of deep trenches and tunnelling in moraines is impossible for most lakes due to their location in the remote mountain environment. Moreover, financial costs of such measures exceed the cost of construction of reliable protective structures aimed at intercepting mudflows in mountain valleys. Nevertheless, timely detection of potentially dangerous glacial lakes and precursory signs for potential debris flow danger, allows for emergency work using the energy of lake water to form an outflow channel.\nGiven specifics of the indicated types of MGLs, one effective way to reduce a threat is to replace the mechanism of emptying the lake from the hazardous \u201cemptying through ice tunnel\u201d to the much less dangerous - \u201cemptying via an open channel\u201d. For this purpose, it is necessary to clear as much of the dead ice as possible at the surface of the lake dam, lower the level of the moraine crest and cause surface overflow when the water level reaches maximum values.\nIn 1985, before a real threat of an impending surge of Bogatyr Glacier (cf. Mukherjee et al., 2017), a large-scale effort was carried out to empty Bogatyr lake in Shilek River basin (see also Fig. 5). For the first time in Kazakhstan, an MGL was artificially drained using open channels along the outcropping ice core (Fig. 12\n). Within two days of removing the moraine ridge using explosives, about 7 million m3 of water discharged via an open channel in the ice core and the lake level was lowered by about 10\u00a0m. The maximum discharge flow rate was 105 m3\/s which did not have negative impacts in the lower Shilek River valley.\nPreventive work on emptying MGLs in the study area has persisted until the present day. Siphons and pumps are used to lower the water level in the lakes. Deepening and expansion of evacuation channels is carried out using mechanized tools. One example is Lake No. 6 in Kishi Almaty River basin which formed at an altitude of 3600\u00a0m above sea level near Manshuk Mametova Glacier (Fig. 13\n). During the 1990s the lake became the most dangerous in the Ile Alatau and its volume exceeded 190,000\u00a0m3 with a maximum depth of 18.5\u00a0m. Water volume in the lake increased due to thawing of buried ice strata and retreat of the glacier tongue. At present, the volume of the lake exceeds 200,000\u00a0m3, despite the ongoing preventive work, and substantial water level decrease is prevented by the frozen moraine core, which has been exposed by the channel.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nInventory and evolution of moraine-dammed glacial lakes\nSeveral glacial lake inventories exist for South-East Kazakhstan both generated by local scientists with the focus on the study region and by international scientists as part of mapping larger regions. For the earlier inventories, especially for those based on aerial images (e.g. Tokmagambetov et al., 1980; Popov, 1991), no digital outlines are available making direct comparisons impossible. A further complication is that the definition of \u201cglacial lake\u201d varied, and different lakes were included in the inventories. However, there are a few recent glacial lake inventories with outlines available which allow more detailed analyses. Most studies used Landsat images and automated methods to delineate glacial lakes for larger regions where SE Kazakhstan is included. Wang et al. (2020) and Chen et al. (2021) generated inventories for whole High Mountain Asia while Shugar et al. (2020) investigated lakes globally. Wangchuk and Bolch (2020) developed a fully automated method to map glacial lakes using both optical (Sentinel-2) and microwave (Sentinel-1) imagery. For comparison we both investigated the lakes visually and the information provided in the data bases and only considered the glacier-fed proglacial lakes. Both the number and area of the identified glacial lakes vary significantly between the inventories. The global study by Shugar et al. (2020) identified only few larger lakes while Wang et al. (2020) is the most detailed study. However, even this study failed to identify several glacial lakes in comparison to our detailed manually derived inventory (Table 7\n).\nAll available studies agree that there was a strong increase of both number and area of glacial lakes between about 1990 and the most recent time despite the fact that several lakes drained. Hence, the genesis, evolution and distribution of the MGLs in the study area and their close relationship to the general trend of glacier retreat and to comparable moraine-glacial complexes in various mountain systems of the Earth (Narama et al., 2009; Emmer, 2017, Shugar et al., 2020). However, there is a clear variation among the different studies between the magnitude of increase. Those studies covering our whole study region report an increase of about 1.7 and 1.9% per year. Wang et al. (2013) report a 26% increase between 1990 and 2012 (~1.2%\/a on average) for the whole northern Tien Shan (Ile and Kung\u00f6y Alatau, including the Kyrgyz part) and Bolch et al. (2011) report an increase of 74% between 1972 and 2007 (2.1%\/a on average) for the central part of Northern Tien Shan, including the Kyrgyz part where most of the lakes are located. Our study also reveals an increase of both the number and area of glacial lakes but the increase is significantly lower in comparison to the other studies. We also identified a higher number glacial lakes. We believe that our results offer a precise record as we manually delineated the glacial lakes using higher resolution data and we have also detailed local knowledge. Small lakes are often not identified in automated approaches or omitted due to a size threshold. Moreover, misclassifications are common due to the heterogeneous nature of the lakes. The studies using automated methods, e.g. identified the large Bolshaya Almatinka Lake as glacial lake which is actually a lake which was blocked by a landslide and has now an artificial dam. This lake was therefore excluded for the comparison shown in Table 7. It needs, however, also to be noted that both the methodological differences, different definitions as well as slightly contrasting study periods are possible reasons for the variations among the studies.\nThis comparison shows the clear need for a reassessment of both the former inventories and the recent ones using consistent methodology and definitions to obtain both the most accurate inventory and information of the growth of the lakes. We also want to highlight the importance of open access of the data availability to enable direct comparisons.\n\n\n6.2\nIdentification, assessment and frequency of past outburst event\nThe documented number of glacial debris flows and floods in South-East Kazakhstan was highest in the second half of the 20th century and a limited number have been reported after 2000. This tendency is in line with the globally reported occurrence of glacial lake outbursts which showed decline on average after the 1970s despite ongoing atmospheric warming and a general increase in number and area of glacial lakes (Harrison et al., 2018). A remote sensing-based study found an unchanged GLOF frequency in the Himalayas since the availability of suitable imagery at the end of the 1980s (Veh et al., 2019). However, it needs to be noted that the past outburst events were not identified in a consistent way and automated remote sensing-based analysis is only possible with the availability of Landsat TM data since the mid 1980s. These facts might cause some biases. This is true for all studies and in particular also for South-East Kazakhstan where the outbursts were mainly identified based on reported floods at the foothills. It is therefore recommended to reassess the occurrence in a systematic way. This could be done in a first instance using an automated method based on lower resolution satellite imagery such as multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel- 2 data (cf. Veh et al., 2019). A detailed assessment should then be visually conducted in a systematic way based on available high resolution aerial images or satellite images (such as Corona KH4, e.g. Bolch et al., 2011) from an earlier time period and very high-resolution satellite images (spatial resolution 1\u00a0m or better) such as Pl\u00e9iades or Worldview for the contemporary time.\n\n\n6.3\nEmpirical formulations and modelling: Lake volume and peak discharge events\n\n6.3.1\nLake volume\nSeveral empirical formulations were developed to estimate the lake volume from the surface area (Table 8\n). These formulas were established based on measurements in a specific region (e.g. Evans, 1986a; Inland Waters Directorate, 1977; O'Connor et al., 2001) or based on a compilation of existing bathymetric measurement compiled from the literature either for larger regions or even based on measurements in different regions on Earth (e.g. Huggel et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2013; Cook and Quincey, 2015). Widely applied formula includes the formula presented by Huggel et al. (2002) which is based on selected measurements of different types of glacial lakes worldwide but also Inland Waters Directorate (1977) which was developed for several ice-dammed lakes in the Canadian Rockies. Recently, Kapitsa et al. (2018) developed a new formula for SE Kazakhstan based on 45 measurements in the Ile Alatau and Zhsetu (Dzungarian Alatau).\nIn order to evaluate the results of these formulas, we compared these to measured volumes of selected glacial lakes in with various characteristics and sizes (Table 9\n). The results show that five out of ten suggested formulas match on average the measurements with a deviation of +\u00a0\u2212\u00a020% and two even within +\u00a0\u2212\u00a010%. Interestingly this includes the formula by Inland Waters Directorate (1977) and applied by Evans (1986a) for landslide-dammed lakes which was developed based a few ice-dammed lakes only. The best fit shows unsurprisingly the newly developed formula by Kapitsa et al. (2018) which was calibrated for glacial lakes in the study region. The formula by Popov (1986b, 1988), often applied in the study area, underestimates the volume of most glacial lakes by on average about 15% while the formula by Huggel et al. (2002) overestimates the volume by more than 20%. This is in tendency in line with Kapitsa et al. (2018) who also found a higher overestimation by the formula suggested by Huggel et al. (2002). When estimating the potential impact of an outburst, a slight overestimation rather than an underestimation of the volume is advantageous as otherwise modelling results of potential outbursts and peak discharges could underestimate the impact. This could have more severe impacts in case of an outburst if mitigation measures such as protection construction are planned based on the underestimated results.\n\nIndividual lakes can have higher deviations from the measurements. The highest deviation has Lake No. 13 in Turgen Valley which has an untypically long flatter part towards the moraine dam (Kapitsa et al., 2018). All formulas clearly overestimate the volume of this lake with the lowest overestimation by the two formulas calibrated in the study region. Without considering this lake the formula by Popov underestimates the average volume by clearly more than 20% and also the formula by Inland Waters Directorate (1977)\/Evans (1986a) has a clearly higher volume underestimation. Almost all formulas match best Akkol Lake and Lake No. 1 in Kishi Almaty. These lakes have a relatively homogeneous shape (slightly longer than wide and a relatively parabolic shape in depth. While Lake No. 1 is in contact with the glacier Akkol Lake, which is also moraine dammed, is since long time not in contact with the glacier anymore.\nThe comparison shows that the considered formulas apart from O'Connor et al. (2001) provide a suitable estimation of the overall volume (up to about 25% error), but those developed based on measurements of selected glacial lakes in the study area have the lowest error. However, the deviation can be large for individual lakes in particular for those with irregular shape. It is, hence, recommended apart from conducting more in-situ measurements and to calibrate the formulas for the study region to further develop existing formulas including a shape factor or to further develop and apply more physics-based models similar to those who estimate the glacier-bed topography and allow to identify overdeependings (e.g. Linsbauer et al., 2016) but applying them to former glacier conditions.\n\n\n6.3.2\nPeak discharge\nEmpirical relationships between lake volume and peak water discharge during the outburst events are of great practical significance in assessing MGL outburst hazard in Kazakhstan. In this discussion section we compare the results presented in Section 4.4 to further widely applied empirical formulas to estimate the peak discharge using the similar data from the observed outbursts in the study region.\nThe maximum values of \u03bb (Eq. (5)) for MGL discharge via open channels (Table 1) of 0.0612\u00a0m\/h, match well the similar \u03bb values (0.6\u00a0m\/h) which were observed in the Caucasus, when water overflowed an ice dam (Dokukin et al., 2012; Dokukin and Khatkutov, 2016). The identified relationship also provides suitable results for glacial lakes in other mountain regions of the Earth (Popov, 1986b, 1988).\nThe results for Lake No. 7 shows that the Eqs. (6) and (7) previously applied in the study region match the modelling based on a hydraulic model relatively well (Table 10). Eqs. (9) and (10) provide clearly too low values. Eq. (11) shows clearly overestimated values while Formula (12) produces results closer to the measurements. Eq. (12) was also developed based on examples from the study region but not for piping as an initial trigger, rather for overtopping of the terminal moraine. Similar results are found for the peak discharge of the outbursts of Lake No. 16 (Table 10). This comparison shows that the applied formulas for the study region provide reasonable results for the estimation of the peak discharge and were well chosen. The well-known Eq. (6) (Clague-Mathews equation, Clague and Mathews, 1973) for determining maximum discharge during the outburst through an ice tunnel, obtained for large glacier dammed lakes with water volume in a wide range from 2.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0m3 (Strupvatnet Lake, Norway, 1969) to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012\u00a0m3 (lake Missoula, Montana, Pleistocene), proved also to be suitable for evaluating the characteristics of relatively small-volume MGLs in south-eastern Kazakhstan. In general, this connection between flood volume and peak discharge is also observed for outburst cases with different triggers; both when ice masses or rock (debris) collapse into lakes, as well as the moraine dam's loss of stability (Evans, 1986b; Huggel et al., 2002).\nThese empirical-based formulas provide a simple method to estimate the peak discharge and, hence, a robust first order approximation which can be used for a basic hazard assessment. The major advantage is their simplicity as only one or few input values are needed. The results of this comparison show that the trigger mechanism is of less importance to consider but the formulas should be calibrated and validated based on past observations of the respective study regions under consideration. For more detailed information about the timing, duration and magnitude of outburst events hydraulic models are recommended. These need, however, more robust measurements which can and should only be conducted at few lakes with a high danger and risk level as these are laborious and can also be dangerous in remote high mountain environments.\n\n\n\n6.4\nIdentification of hazardous and dangerous glacial lakes\nAs mentioned in Section 4.5 various researchers assessed the outburst hazard of lakes in the study region using different criteria. We used criteria such as the lake volume, lake growth, fluctuations of the water level, characteristics and location of the moraine dam, presence of thermocarst features, or a period of high temperatures. These criteria established in this study region are based on the experience of the researchers and the specifics of the study region. One of the most important causes of outbursts is the failure of the moraine-dams (Emmer and Vil\u00edmek, 2013; Rounce et al., 2016). Typical causes for dam failure are (1) overtopping (e.g. due to a flood wave caused by a rock and ice avalanche), (2) melting of ice within the dam or forming the dam, (3) blocking of or (4) extension of subsurface outflow tunnels or (5) long-term dam degradation (Clague and Evans, 2000; Richardson and Reynolds, 2000; Mergili and Schneider, 2011; Emmer, 2017). Several researchers provided schemes for the assessment of hazard and danger of different moraine-dammed glacial lakes (e.g. Huggel et al., 2002; Jansk\u00fd et al., 2010; Bolch et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Emmer and Vil\u00edmek, 2013; Fujita et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2019). While all approaches have certain differences, they share the consideration of the characteristics of the lake and its changes, the characteristics and stability of the dam, the downstream path and the potential of trigger mechanisms from the surrounding rock slopes. While the different indicators can be assessed objectively to different extents, expert driven subjective decisions have to be made for a final classification. The indicators identified for SE Kazakhstan above are in general in line with the indicators of the published studies and moreover, benefit from the detailed observations made in the study area. The existing studies in SE Kazakhstan revealed also that lake outbursts triggered by rock\/ice avalanches are rather uncommon in contrast to other regions like the Himalaya and were therefore not considered. However, with increasing lake area and numbers of the lakes as well the increased occurrence of lakes in higher hypsometric levels the possibilities of GLOF triggering due to mass movements into the lakes is increasing. Therefore, the probability of mass movements into the lakes should be considered in future studies of this region. It should further be noted that the criteria identified in Section 3.3 are suitable to assess the lake hazard level (i.e. the GLOF frequency and magnitude). The danger level of the lakes (i.e. considering also the exposure to the presence of people, livelihoods, environmental services, infrastructure and other resources that could be adversely affected by a potential hazard) was mainly identified based on the location of the lakes, past outburst events, the discharge mechanisms and the calculated peak discharges. Modelling of the outburst path and the affected areas as suggested and applied by different studies (e.g. Huggel et al., 2003; Bolch et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Allen et al., 2019) were rarely applied in the study region. We therefore encourage the re-evaluation of the hazard criteria and the modelling of the outburst paths and the affected areas and apply it consistently for the whole study area to obtain a consistent inventory of hazardous and dangerous MGL across the study region.\n\n\n6.5\nMitigation measures\nIn case a significant danger and risk level is identified for a specific lake, measurements to mitigate the risk are needed. The best mitigation measure is to significantly reduce the likelihood of an outburst by emptying or strongly lowering the water level of the lake. This is usually associated with strong efforts and high costs as the lakes are in remote areas and a strong reduction relies on the creation of artificial outflow channels. The review of preventive measures of lakes in various countries as well as experience and experiments in south-east Kazakhstan showed that the implementation of preventive measures for emptying the MGL is associated with significant risk if evacuation channels are dug in the ridges of melting ice-cored terminal moraines and may not prevent an outburst. Lakes have outburst during preventive works in several countries including Norway, Peru and Switzerland (Liestol, 1956; Lliboutry et al., 1977; R\u00f6thlisberger, 1971). Kazakhstan has faced a similar example. The water level of a lake \u211613 in upper Kumbelsu River (Ulken Almaty River basin) was lowered in 1976 and 1977 by an artificial channel in the dam. In the afternoon of August 3 of 1977, the lake burst. In just over 20\u00a0min, more than 88,000\u00a0m3 of water drained and the peak discharge reached 180\u2013210\u00a0m3\/s. The event caused a series of debris flows with a maximum discharge up to 10,000\u00a0m3\/s of the largest wave which exited the mountain valley and hit parts of the out-skirts of Almaty city (Esenov and Degovets, 1979). In addition to significant material damage, the debris flow caused human casualties. Therefore, work to deepen the drainage system should include the strengthening of the existing drainage systems. But even then the water level can only be lowered by few meters without incalculable risks. A typical example is Tsho Rolpa Lake, upstream the Rolwaling Khola River in the Himalayas. The lake was lowered and the outflow stabilised (Fig. 14\n) but the lake still contains a substantial volume of water and a model showed that even a partial lake outburst (39.4 million m3) would still lead to a peak discharge close to 34,234 m3\/s, for a 30\u00a0m wide rupture (Shrestha et al., 2013).\nA safer solution is the use of pumps and siphons for pumping out lake water. But it is not a guaranteed solution to eliminate MGL discharge as the water level can be reduced by a few meters only. However, it is considered as an effective tool in combination with other engineering measures. In general, preventive measures aimed at emptying the lakes of morainic-glacial complexes require greater compliance with increased requirements for safety.\nIn case a glacial lake was identified as having a high danger and risk but a significant lowering of the lake level is either too costly or associated with too high risks either construction measures to reduce the affected areas (which have been initiated in SE Kazakhstan as early as the 1930s) or installing an early warning systems (Reynolds, 1995; Huggel et al., 2020a, 2020b) should be considered.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe genesis, evolution and distribution of the MGLs in the study area show their close relationship to the general trend of glacier retreat and to comparable moraine-glacial complexes in various mountain systems of the Earth. Despite the general increase in the number and surface area of glacial lakes associated to glacier recession we did not find an increase in outburst activity. Analyses of statistical data on documented glacial debris flows and floods in South-East Kazakhstan has revealed two stages of outburst activity of the MGL \u2013 with many outbursts occurring in the second half of the 20th century and only few after 2000. At the same time, we found that the total number of lakes slightly increased between 1970 and 2019, despite the disappearance of many lakes as a result of outbursts or evolutionary changes. Due to the retreat of glaciers and the further reduction of their total area, new lakes formed in recent years and the glacial-lake ratio (area of glacial lakes vs. glacier area) increased significantly over the same period. There are indications of an increase in the potential debris flow hazard in recent years, as new MGLs form and existing glacial lakes grow. It should specifically be noted that the new lakes develop at higher hypsographic levels. Such MGLs and their possible drainage represent a major threat due to their greater potential energy. However, despite a large number of recorded GLOF events, glacial debris flows did not occur in all cases, since their formation also requires appropriate conditions in underlying mountain valleys (potential debris flow material, natural debris flow channels, favourable conditions for watering of loose sediments, and significant slopes of the beds).\nOne of the most important causes of outbursts is the failure of the moraine-dams. Data from direct observations and results from land surveys of debris flow traces allowed us to identify three main mechanisms of the MGL outburst events in our study area: surface path via open channels, underground path through ice tunnels (old drainage channels) as well as via rupture in melted moraines. The greatest threat of MGLs stems from discharge via ice tunnels and, especially, through ruptures in melting moraines. In these cases, powerful outburst waves form at the peak of water discharge from the lake, causing debris flows in the lower valleys due to erosion, caving and shear processes. These can cover distances of tens of kilometres and lead to destruction of infrastructure, objects and settlements and can even cause human casualties. Depending on the type of MGL and mechanisms for emptying the lake basins, floods form during breakouts, which differ not only in quantitative characteristics of drainage process, but also in forms of hydrographs. A determining factor for glacial debris flows is the maximum (peak) discharge, which for conditions of the research area may exceed the usual glacier runoff by more than two orders of magnitude. Empirical relationships between lake volume and peak water discharge during the outburst events are of great practical significance in assessing MGL outburst hazard in Kazakhstan. Most proposed formulae to estimate the water volume based on the surface area provide reasonable estimates but calibrating the formula using measurements in the study area is advantageous. The well-known Clague-Mathews equation for determining maximum discharge during the outburst through an ice tunnel, proved suitable for evaluating the characteristics of relatively small-volume MGLs in south-eastern Kazakhstan. In general, this connection between flood volume and peak discharge is also observed for outburst cases with different triggers; both when ice masses or rock (debris) collapse into lakes, as well as the moraine dam's loss of stability. Further direct observations of lake drainage are of special significance to further refine the modelling.\nThe differences in genesis, evolution, hydrological regime and mechanisms of the MGL outburst events in south-east Kazakhstan shown in this study require different approaches to planning and implementing preventive measures on modern moraines. Identified features of the outburst events allow us to give predictive scenarios for development of debris flow, to justify the planning and implementation of appropriate preventive measures.\nPreventive measures aimed at emptying the lakes of morainic-glacial complexes, which are currently being carried out, require greater compliance with increased requirements for safety.\nThe investigation of glacial lakes using a multi-method approach, including remote sensing, field work and simplified models (cf. Fig. 2), has proven to be suitable to detect potentially dangerous glacial lakes and plan mitigation measures. To further improve the knowledge and the assessment of the hazard and danger of the glacial lakes it is necessary to conduct focused studies on moraine-dammed glacial lakes, glacial-moraine complexes, ice-cores of water-retaining moraine dams, runoff channels and filtration zones, as well as the provision of measures to protect the lake dam's integrity. This should include investigations using multi-temporal high-resolution images and digital elevation models and detailed in-situ investigations (such as geophysical investigations and drilling of rock\/ice cores) to plan during mitigation measures but also during preventive construction work. In combination with the presented analyses, these studies and measurements can serve as a basis for a long-term forecast of increased glacial debris flows and floods activity in the study area.\nThis approach can also be extended and adjusted to other study regions and include more triggering factors such as rock-ice avalanches, but could be complemented by investigations of the impact on the downstream area by including more physically-based models of outburst floods and debris flows.\n\n","113":"","114":"","115":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian (E\u2013C) interval marks one of the most significant evolutionary events in the history of life on Earth, as the microbe-dominated communities that persisted for over 3 billion years gave way to a Phanerozoic marine world ruled by mobile animals with modern anatomical features (Briggs, 2015). This biological \u201cexplosion\u201d of life resulted in the emergence of most of the animal phyla in existence today and their abrupt appearance in the Cambrian has long fascinated and perplexed palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists. The key to determining the timing of crucial evolutionary events across this interval hinges on the development of a chronostratigraphic framework that promotes reliable global correlation of Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian sedimentary successions. This is however, a challenging task, as the dearth of continuous E\u2013C stratigraphic successions, in addition to problems associated with recognizing the E\u2013C boundary continue to hamper our understanding of this key transition.\nThe base of the Cambrian is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD) of the ichnofossil Treptichnus pedum within the siliciclastic-dominated Chapel Island Formation in the Fortune Head section on the Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland (Brasier et al., 1994; Landing, 1994). Since the ratification of this boundary in 1992, the Cambrian GSSP has been the source of constant conjecture and three decades later, the controversy only seems to have amplified (Zhu et al., 2006, 2019; Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Babcock et al., 2014, 2011; Peng et al., 2012). The unreliability of T. pedum as a proxy for the base of the Cambrian stems predominantly from its facies dependence and resulting difficulties with correlating clastic settings (where trace fossils are more common) with carbonate sequences (where body fossils of early metazoans occur more frequently and \u03b413C chemostratigraphic signals are obtainable) (e.g., South China, Iran, Kazakhstan and Siberia; Yang et al., 2014a, 2016; Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 2020; Devaere et al., 2021). \u03b413C chemostratigraphic techniques enable global correlation of regional biostratigraphic schemes, and have been rapidly adopted for the early Cambrian when faunas were often strongly endemic (Maloof et al., 2010a, 2010b; Zhu et al., 2019). However, it is clear that chemostratigraphic data must be employed as part of a multi-proxy dataset in order to extract the most reliable signals for dating and correlation (Babcock and Peng, 2007; Peng et al., 2012; Babcock et al., 2015; Betts et al., 2016, 2017a, 2017b, 2018; Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021). Mixed siliciclastic-carbonate successions have the capacity to provide a diverse range of important chronostratigraphic data, and have therefore become increasingly crucial in the search for and integration of reliable stratigraphic markers for global correlation in the Cambrian.\nThe Zavkhan Basin in southwestern Mongolia preserves Cryogenian to early Cambrian deposits (Bold et al., 2016a, 2016b; Smith et al., 2016a; Dorjnamjaa et al., 2016, 2018). The sequence consists of the carbonate dominated Tsagaan-Olom Group and overlying Zuun-Arts Formation, followed by the mixed carbonate-siliciclastic Bayangol Formation (Bold et al., 2016a, 2016b; Smith et al., 2016a). This region has been the focus of a number of scientific studies since the 1960s (Bezzubetsev, 1963; Voronin et al., 1982; Brasier et al., 1996a, 1996b; Smith et al., 2016a; Adachi et al., 2019, 2021; Yang et al., 2020) however, a consensus on the temporal framework and the position of the E\u2013C boundary within this succession has not been reached.\nSouthwestern Mongolia is one of only a few areas in the world preserving a thick, continuous mixed siliciclastic and carbonate succession that spans the latest Ediacaran to early Cambrian. As such, it provides the ideal setting to compare the variety of chronostratigraphic tools that have emerged to correlate potential stage boundaries within the Cambrian. Multi-proxy investigations provide the most robust methods of global correlation. However, while all the essential chronostratigraphic elements have been documented in the Zavkhan succession, the decoupling of palaeontological investigations (Voronin et al., 1982; Gibsher and Khomentovsky, 1990; Esakova and Zhegallo, 1996) and chemostratigraphic data (Brasier et al., 1996a; Maloof et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2016a) has thwarted temporal resolution of these sequences. Furthermore, previous sampling at stratigraphically meaningless \u201cspot localities\u201d or the construction of composite sections that are difficult to replicate has led to discrepancies between age estimates for these rock units and confounded temporal resolution of early animal evolution preserved in one of the most complete Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian successions in the world (Brasier et al., 1996b; Maloof et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2016a; Landing and Kruse, 2017). To address these issues, we present the first high-resolution multi-proxy chronostratigraphic investigation of the Ediacaran to basal Cambrian Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations at Bayan Gol in the Zavkhan Basin, southwestern Mongolia (Fig. 1\n). This study integrates detailed, simultaneously sampled, high-resolution shelly fossil biostratigraphy with \u03b413C chemostratigraphy and lithostratigraphic data. We also review the difficulties surrounding global correlation of the E\u2013C boundary and discuss how the succession in Bayan Gol clarifies problems stemming from these disputes.\n\n\n2\nPrevious work on the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian deposits of the Zavkhan Basin\nThe Zavkhan terrane is one of the Proterozoic cratonic fragments in southwestern Mongolia that make up the core of the Central Asian orogenic belt (Macdonald et al., 2009; Bold et al., 2013; Bold et al., 2016a, 2016b; Dorjnamjaa et al., 2016). Sedimentary sequences spanning the E\u2013C transition are widespread across the Zavkhan Basin. The stratigraphic section through the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations on the southern fault block in Bayan Gol in particular, has been the focus of many previous studies, laying the foundation for both regional and global correlation (Gibsher et al., 1991; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Lindsay et al., 1996; Goldring and Jensen, 1996; Kruse et al., 1996; Brasier et al., 1996b; Esakova and Zhegallo, 1996; Maloof et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2016a; Fig. 1). Despite extensive previous research, our understanding of this particular section and stratigraphy in the Zavkhan Basin more broadly, continues to be unsettled. This is due to 1) inadequate or at least non-systematic sampling for skeletal faunas, 2) disagreements surrounding interpretations of the stratigraphy of the sequence and 3) decoupling of biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic studies. These factors have led to discrepancies between age estimates for the same rock units, hindering regional and global correlation (Voronin et al., 1982; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Brasier et al., 1996b; Maloof et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2016a, 2017; Landing and Kruse, 2017).\n\n2.1\nStratigraphy and mapping\nMuch of the early work in the Zavkhan Basin was dominated by Soviet and Mongolian groups, who mapped parts of the region and amassed an abundance of geological and palaeontological data from numerous sections across the basin (e.g., Markova et al., 1972; Korobov and Missarzhevsky, 1977; Voronin et al., 1982). Geological formations were subdivided into numbered lithostratigraphic units (Voronin et al., 1982), to assist with the correlation of regional sections and allow the construction of composite biostratigraphic range charts (Voronin et al., 1982; Gibsher and Khomentovsky, 1990; Gibsher et al., 1991). This work primarily focused on providing correlation between the Mongolian and Siberian successions, and by using skeletal fossil assemblages they were able to recognize the Nemakit-Dalydynian, Tommotian, Atdabanian and Botoman stages of the Siberian timescale in the Zavkhan Basin (Voronin et al., 1982; Dorjnamjaa and Bat-Ireedui, 1991). Based on the appearance of distinctive Tommotian fossils, the base of the Tommotian Stage (and hence the base of the Cambrian at that time), was considered by Voronin et al. (1982) to lie at the base of \u2018unit 5\u2019 in Salaany Gol. This unit was later correlated with the base of \u2018unit 19\u2019 in Bayan Gol (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Brasier et al., 1996a, 1996b) which is immediately above our measured BAY4\/5 section and therefore likely to be ~180 m above the E\u2013C boundary (as defined herein).\nThese studies during the second half of the 20th century laid the foundations for future work in the region. However, with time, methods used by these groups have become ambiguous, creating complications when attempting to integrate their results with later investigations. Few details about individual sections were initially provided in these early publications and the sections themselves were frequently not mapped (Markova et al., 1972; Korobov and Missarzhevsky, 1977; Missarzhevsky, 1977). Sampling resolution in these studies is usually insufficient for detailed correlations as locations of palaeontological samples were often designated to broad lithological units (frequently over 50 m in thickness, e.g., Voronin et al., 1982; figs 5, 15) rather than from specific stratigraphic heights along systematically measured sections. Furthermore, samples appear to have been taken sporadically through the successions, heavily concentrated in some units and absent from others (see Voronin et al., 1982, figs 11, 13). In addition, these lithological units were used to develop composite stratigraphic range charts for correlation across the basin regardless of what are likely to be dramatic lateral facies changes, even within a small geographical area (Voronin et al., 1982, fig. 13).\nIn the early 1990\u2019s an International Geoscience Programme (IGCP: Project 303) expedition led by Martin Brasier (Oxford University, UK) and Dorj Dorjnamjaa (Geological Institute, Mongolia) resulted in a Geological Magazine volume dedicated to the Neoproterozoic\u2013Cambrian transition in southwestern Mongolia (Brasier et al., 1996a, 1996b; Evans et al., 1996; Goldring and Jensen, 1996; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Kruse et al., 1996; Lindsay et al., 1996). This included the translation of maps and descriptions of key Mongolian sections into English (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996), detailed regional sequence stratigraphy (Lindsay et al., 1996) and the presentation of new biostratigraphic (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996) and chemostratigraphic data (Brasier et al., 1996b). Hence, this contribution made considerable headway with communicating the significance of these successions to the international community. However, methodologies adopted by authors from the IGCP expedition did not greatly improve on those of their predecessors. The previously established system of numbering broad lithostratigraphic units was again employed to facilitate correlation across the basin, and although geological maps were presented for many of the documented localities, the absence of measured section lines, irregular sampling methods and lack of imaged fossil material plague these works.\nThe stratigraphy and geological mapping of Bayan Gol (together with Tsagaan Gol, Salaany Gol and Taishir localities) was presented by Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996). These sections across the Zavkhan Basin were subsequently correlated using numbered lithostratigraphic units for which composite litho-, bio- and chemostratigraphic charts could be developed (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Brasier et al., 1996b). In Bayan Gol, Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) interpreted significant thrust faults resulting in repetition of units 17 and 18 (Fig. 2\n; also see Gibsher et al., 1991). A consequence of this interpretation is that only one set of units 17 and 18 is dealt with lithostratigraphically, while strata interpreted as repeated is omitted (Fig. 2; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 6). In the present study, the lowermost unit 17 of Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) represents the top of the Zuun-Arts Formation, and the uppermost 17 and the lowermost unit 18 are roughly equivalent to the lower Bayangol Formation (Fig. 2; also compare Fig. 1 to Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 6).\nGeological mapping of this part of Bayan Gol has been recently updated (Smith et al., 2016a). Reinvestigation of the area where extensive fault repetition of strata had been documented by Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) demonstrated that these strata are more likely to be continuous (Smith et al., 2016a, figs 6B, 8). Faulting would likely have resulted in the distinct, large domical stromatolites of upper unit 18 (the end of the BAY4\/5 section in the present study, Bed K of Lindsay et al., 1996) cropping out in their lower unit 18 (Fig. 2; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 13), which has not been observed in later studies. Field observations made in the present study included numerous offsets due to small faults, however beds are clearly traceable. Hence, we concur with Smith et al. (2016a fig. 6B) that the lower Bayangol Formation on the west side of the gorge represents continuous stratigraphy (Fig. 2). This reinterpretation dramatically changes the measured thickness of the Bayangol Formation in Bayan Gol (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996 omitted approximately 120 m of strata thought to have represented fault repetition) and further complicates interpretation of the lithostratigraphic framework employed by the authors from the IGCP expedition.\n\n\n2.2\nBiostratigraphic studies\nOne of the main aims of Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) was to provide a framework for the stratigraphic succession of skeletal fossils in southwestern Mongolia. The main method for constructing this framework was the identification of key \u2018marker beds\u2019 within numbered lithological units used to correlate disparate packages of strata. The ultimate goal was to construct a single, \u201csuper composite\u201d biostratigraphic range chart to which new data and all previously published data could be tied (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, figs 6, 11). This biostratigraphic scheme included data from the succession exposed in Bayan Gol and was subsequently utilized for the entire Geological Magazine special issue.\nIn Bayan Gol, the palaeontological sampling of Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996), fig. 6) was restricted to 20 samples through 400 m true thickness of strata, and out of these the approximate stratigraphic levels of only twelve were provided, five of which were from the same horizon. Together with this vague biostratigraphic data from Bayan Gol, additional data was incorporated from three other disparate localities; Orolgo Gol, Salaany Gol and Tsagaan Gol (see Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 13). This biostratigraphic range chart was also expanded upon by Brasier et al. (1996b), fig. 6) who included additional fossil occurrences documented by Esakova and Zhegallo (1996) from Bayan Gol, Salaany Gol and Orolgo Gol. Based on the occurrence of eponymous taxa, the Anabarites trisulcatus and Purella zones of the Nemakit-Daldynian Stage of Siberia were identified within the basal Zuun-Arts Formation through to the basal Bayangol Formation, with the base of the Tommotian Stage occurring in their unit 19 (stratigraphically above the measured section presented herein) (Voronin et al., 1982; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996). The absence of Tommotian archaeocyaths however, caused Brasier et al. (1996a, 1996b) to question this temporal framework, instead suggesting that most of the Bayangol Formation was Nemakit\u2013Daldynian in age.\nIt is difficult to assess the accuracy of this composite biostratigraphic column as unit thickness and lithology appear to vary considerably across the basin and key marker beds used for correlation are not entirely clear (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 11). These methods were also criticised by Smith et al. (2016a) who observed that extensive lateral facies changes across the basin make lithostratigraphic correlations unreliable. Ambiguous correlations led Smith et al. (2016a) to revise the FAD of a number of shelly fossil groups, most notably the oldest skeletal fauna from the Zavkhan Basin. For example, Anabarites and Cambrotubulus (from the Anabarites trisulcatus Zone; Brasier et al., 1996b) were initially interpreted to have been collected from near the base of the Zuun-Arts Formation in Orolgo Gol (Endonzhamts and Lkhasuren, 1988; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, figs 11, 13) and were therefore regarded as Precambrian in age (Brasier et al., 1996b). While recent studies have documented cloudinids from the basal Zuun-Arts Formation (Yang et al., 2020), the presence of Anabarites or Cambrotubulus at these levels have not been confirmed (Smith et al., 2016a; Yang et al., 2020 and herein). Because of previously incorrect mapping in Orolgo Gol, Smith et al. (2016a) suggested that these fossil occurrences should be placed 200\u2013300 m higher in the lower Bayangol Formation. In the present study, although poorly preserved tubular fossils occur in the Zuun-Arts Formation (BAY1\/104.0-107.8, Figs 3\u20134\n\n), the first definitive occurrence of Anabarites trisulcatus and Cambrotubulus decurvatus (Fig. 5\n) is also in the lower Bayangol Formation, further supporting recent reinterpretations of these stratigraphic relationships.\nUnreliability of previously employed lithostratigraphic correlation methods casts doubt on the utility of a single composite stratigraphic chart such as that presented in Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996), fig. 13) and Brasier et al. (1996b), fig. 6). This coupled with erroneous mapping of the Bayan Gol section has resulted in the stratigraphic misplacement of a number of fossil occurrences in their range chart over this crucial interval. Discrepancies between geological mapping and stratigraphic sampling confound correlation (Fig. 2). For example, based on the geological map presented in Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 6), sample R-VI was collected from \u2018unit 18\u2019 in the lower Bayangol Formation, over one hundred meters northeast of samples R-IV, V, VIII, IX (upper \u2018unit 18\u2019). Therefore, the location of sample R-VI should correspond to strata that are stratigraphically below where R-IV, V, VIII, IX were taken. However, in their super composite column and biostratigraphic chart (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 13), sample R-VI is placed stratigraphically higher than samples R-IV, V, VIII, IX, due to the interpreted fault repetition (Fig. 2; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996). The development of this super-composite column further obscures important data: Sample R-VI in Bayan Gol and R-XXI from Tsagaan Gol are represented as precisely the same horizons, despite being collected in localities ~30 km apart (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, figs 11, 13). Hence, the kinds of fossil taxa that were recovered from each horizon remains unclear. Across both samples (R-VI and XXI) fossil genera reported include Anabarites, Cambrotubulus, Halkieria, Maikhanella and Lophochites; taxa comparable to that documented from the lower Bayangol Formation herein (Fig. 5). However, because the exact stratigraphic location of each sample is uncertain very little meaningful data can be extracted from the assemblages presented in Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996). The erroneous stratigraphic placement of samples also explains the apparently very early appearance of the mollusc Purella panda (recovered from samples R-IV, V, VIII, IX) in the base of the Bayangol Formation (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 13). This horizon corresponds to levels much higher in the section when omitted stratigraphy is included (closer to the top of section BAY4\/5 herein). An even earlier occurrence of Purella sp. from the top of the Zuun-Arts Formation is peculiar and requires confirmation, as Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) did not image any fossil material. In our study we have not recovered specimens of Purella from the lower Bayangol Formation. All cap-shaped shells in our samples from section BAY4\/5 can readily be identified as Maikhanella multa based on the characteristic presence of short sclerite-like scales penetrating the granular matrix of the shell, which differ from the continuous scaly external ornament of Purella (Bengtson, 1992; Devaere et al., 2013).\nNevertheless, Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) did document a number of key fossil taxa, most notably Protohertzina unguliformis from what appears to be the top of their unit 17 (Fig. 2; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, sample RIII, fig. 13). Protohertzina unguliformis represents the oldest skeletal fossil occurrence that Khomentovsky and Gibsher (1996) recovered from Bayan Gol (although Zuunia chimidtsereni has recently been documented from near the base of the Zuun-Arts Formation by Yang et al., 2020). Based on the geographic location of this sample (R-III) on the geological map (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996, fig. 6) it should approximately correlate with the first occurrence (FO) of Protohertzina in the present study (Fig. 5). However, confusion generated by erroneous mapping in the region and the lack of systematic sampling has considerably diminished the reliability of these fossil occurrences, including the location of this Protohertzina-bearing sample (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996). The combination of questionable lithostratigraphic correlation techniques used to construct composite range charts, errors with interpreting and mapping geological structures and indiscriminate palaeontological sampling methodologies dramatically reduces the capacity for this biostratigraphic framework to be applied to modern investigations. Consequently, the present study contributes critical new data that addresses these issues.\n\n\n2.3\n\u03b413C chemostratigraphic studies\nThe application of \u03b413C chemostratigraphy for correlation in the Cambrian was still in its infancy when Brasier et al. (1996b) presented the first chemostratigraphic framework for the Zavkhan Basin. Global excursion acronyms (e.g., \u201cBACE\u201d) were yet to be coined by Zhu et al. (2006), and so naming conventions for positive and negative peaks differed between studies. In Brasier et al. (1996b) the strong negative \u03b413C excursion in the lower Zuun-Arts Formation in Bayan Gol (-3.3\u2030) referred to as \u201canomaly \u2018W\u2019\u201d was interpreted as representing the major negative excursion seen in the interval between the late Neoproterozoic and earliest Cambrian and was compared to similar curves from Siberia, Iran and Canada (Brasier et al., 1990, 1994; Ripperdan, 1994; Kaufman and Knoll, 1995). Anomaly \u2018W\u2019 and the first appearance of Anabarites trisulcatus provided important anchor points for correlation with the Siberian sections (with excursion \u2018N\u2019 in the Dvortsy section, Braiser et al., 1993; Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 13). However, it should be noted that the occurrence of Anabarites in the lower Zuun-Arts Formation is most likely erroneous based on unreliable correlations (see above) (Smith et al., 2016a; Yang et al., 2020; herein).\n\nSmith et al. (2016a, fig. 8) reported a wide range of isotopic values through the Zuun-Arts Formation in the Zavkhan Basin. In the lower to middle Zuun-Arts Formation at Bayan Gol, values fluctuate between +2\u2030 and -4\u2030 (sometimes lower) (Smith et al., 2016a, fig. 8). In contrast, the lower to middle Zuun-Arts Formation in Khunkher Gorge is characterized by relatively constant values that plateau around 0\u2030 (Smith et al., 2016a, fig. 8). Despite significant variations in isotopic values in the lower-middle Zuun-Arts Formation, a strong negative \u03b413C excursion (minimum value of -7\u2030) was consistently reported by Smith et al. (2016a) in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation across the Zavkhan Basin. In Bayan Gol the nadir of this excursion occurs 11.3 m below the base of the Bayangol Formation, followed by a series of positive excursions in the lower Bayangol Formation. Smith et al. (2016a, 2017, fig. 12, supplemental material) interpreted this excursion as representing the BACE and correlated it with anomaly \u2018W\u2019 of Brasier et al. (1996b). However, there are discrepancies between the stratigraphic occurrence of this excursion in the Smith et al. (2016a) data and the Brasier et al. (1996b) data. The BACE excursion reported by Smith et al. (2016a) in Bayan Gol occurs ~190 m true thickness above the Boxonia stromatolites that define the base of the Zuun-Arts Formation, whereas anomaly \u2018W\u2019 of Brasier et al. (1996b) occurs only ~43 m above the Boxonia stromatolites (their unit 12) in the same locality. In addition, Brasier et al. (1996b, figs 5, 8) also show the \u2018W\u2019 anomaly in lower\u2013mid levels in the Zuun-Arts Formation in the northern block of Bayan Gol and in Tsagaan Gol (~40 km west of Bayan Gol). In contrast, the BACE in Smith et al. (2016a, fig. 8) is consistently associated with the boundary of the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations. Hence, correlation of these excursions is problematic.\n\nBrasier et al. (1996b, figs 5, 9,11) document a negative excursion towards the top of the Zuun-Arts Formation that reaches \u03b413C values of -6.2\u2030 in the Tsagaan Gol section (Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 5, Table 2) and -3.9\u2030 in the Bayan Gol section (Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 9). This excursion was not named, but represents the lower part (before values begin to rise) of the positive \u2018B\u2019 peak that occurs in the lower Bayangol Formation (Brasier et al., 1996b). Based on the magnitude and stratigraphic position of this unnamed negative excursion we consider it a better candidate for correlation with the excursion interpreted as the BACE in Smith et al. (2016a). It is difficult to pinpoint anomaly \u2018W\u2019 of Brasier et al. (1996b) given the wide range of \u03b413C values presented by Smith et al. (2016a) in the lower Zuun-Arts Formation, however it is unlikely to be equivalent to the excursion close to the Zuun-Arts\u2013Bayangol boundary.\nFollowing the BACE, Smith et al. (2016a) show a positive peak (+3.6\u2030) in the lower Bayangol Formation that correlates with peak 2p in Siberia (maximum values of +2\u2030; Kouchinsky et al., 2007) and China (maximum values of +4\u2030; Ishikawa et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013). However, correlating the Siberian 2p peak with data presented by Brasier et al. (1996b) through the lower Bayangol Formation in Bayan Gol is challenging. This area was initially considered to include fault repetition (described above), hence there are considerable uncertainties regarding precise locations of sampling levels. According to Brasier et al. (1996b fig. 9), peak \u2018B\u2019 coincided with a distinctive stromatolite horizon ~20 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation. However, recent reinterpretations of these strata indicate that these stromatolites occur ~150 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation (Figs. 1\u20132, 5). Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether peak \u2018B\u2019 of Brasier et al. (1996b) occurs within their lower unit 18, immediately above the contact with the Zuun-Arts Formation or from their upper unit 18, 150 meters higher up in the section. Unfortunately, little can be gleaned from nearby stratigraphic sections; the levels including excursion \u2018B\u2019 are either faulted (northern block of Bayan Gol [Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 8]) or marred by sampling issues (Khevtte-Tsakhir-Nuruu ridge), resulting in a unique isotopic signal, dissimilar to other sections (Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 10). The chemostratigraphic signal in Tsagaan Gol is perhaps the most continuous and reliable reported by Brasier et al., 1996b, fig. 5) and does show two positive peaks (\u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019) through the lower Bayangol Formation separated by a broad negative excursion that reaches values of -3\u2030. Hence, peak \u2018B\u2019 is most likely to correlate with peak 2p based on isotopic values and stratigraphic position in the lower Bayangol Formation.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nSampling\nPreliminary fieldwork in Bayan Gol, Zavkhan Basin, southwestern Mongolia was conducted in August, 2017 and comprehensive measurement and collection through Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian strata took place in August 2018. Two sections were measured. The BAY1 section captures the lowermost 155.8 m of the Zuun-Arts Formation (Fig. 3) and the BAY4\/5 section herein captures the uppermost 11.96 m of the Zuun-Arts Formation and 149.59 m of the overlying Bayangol Formation (Fig. 5). BAY1 was measured on the northeast side of Bayan Gol (base of section coordinates are N46\u00b042\u201941.1\u201d\/E96\u00b018\u201957.6\u201d; Fig. 1), commencing at the karstic horizon that defines the boundary between the Shuurgat Formation and the distinctive Boxonia stromatolites at the base of the Zuun-Arts Formation (Smith et al., 2016a; Adachi et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Initial exploration of the lower Zuun-Arts Formation revealed relatively continuous strata. However, strong faulting further upsection disrupted strata, making individual beds increasingly difficult to follow. Hence, BAY1 was terminated at BAY1\/226.1 (155.8 m true thickness from base) (Figs 1, 3).\nBAY4\/5 was measured on the western side of Bayan Gol (Fig. 1) and intersects the uppermost 11.96 m of the Zuun-Arts Formation (Fig. 5). Obvious faults stratigraphically below the BAY4\/5 section (Fig. 1) prevented the section being extended further down into the underlying Zuun-Arts Formation. It is most likely that the two sections (BAY1 and BAY4\/5) do not stratigraphically overlap. We attempted to replicate previous work that managed to develop stratigraphically thicker \u201ccomposite columns\u201d for the Zuun-Arts Formation in Bayan Gol by correlating separate stratigraphic sections measured in adjacent fault blocks (Brasier et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2016a; Fig. 1). However, our investigation of the area showed the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation to be characterised by a series of massive, blocky, carbonate parasequences with few distinctive features. Distinctive \u201cmarker horizons\u201d are rare or absent, precluding confident replication of composite columns created via correlation across faults. Samples taken through the lower Zuun-Arts Formation were processed for both stable isotopes and shelly fossil extraction and have yielded only a few poorly preserved tubular fossils (Fig. 4).\nIn the present study our aim was to reduce as much as possible the potential for errors made when correlating across faulted blocks through lithologically similar units. This results in stratigraphically reduced, but more reliable and reproducible measured sections. Locations where sections have been measured were carefully chosen for their capacity to provide continuous strata in terrain that could be measured with a tape, and where the need for offsets were minimal. If offsets were required, they were made on strongly outcropping beds, or by following clear lithological signals along strike to ensure that no levels were missed or duplicated. Hence, BAY4\/5 (Fig. 1) was measured on a single fault block through a relatively undisturbed, continuous sequence ensuring that biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic data presented herein may be reproduced by future workers.\nSection BAY4\/5 (Fig. 5) was measured in two parts (Fig. 1). BAY4 was measured through the upper Zuun-Arts Formation (base of section coordinates are N46\u00b042\u201924.5\u201d\/E96\u00b018\u201936.9\u201d). Distinctive phosphatic crusts with SSFs apparent in hand sample occur at BAY4-13, 11.35 m true thickness above the base of the section. To avoid large areas of poor outcrop, this phosphatic horizon was traced ~100 m southwest to an appropriate location to begin section BAY5 (Fig. 1). BAY5 is measured from the phosphatic horizon in the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation (BAY4-13 = BAY5-0.0, base of section coordinates are N46\u00b042\u201922.2\u201d\/E96\u00b018\u201937.6\u201d) and intersects 150.20 m of strata, including the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation and the overlying lower Bayangol Formation (top of section coordinates are N46\u00b042\u201912.8\u201d\/ E96\u00b018\u201929.8\u201d). BAY4\/5 terminates at the yellowish crust overlying large (~40 cm diameter) domical stromatolites in the Bayan Gol Formation (Figs. 1,2,5; Bed K of basal sequence 9 of Lindsay et al., 1996, within unit 18 of Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996). Total true thickness for the section BAY4\/5 is 161.55 m.\nBAY 1 and BAY4\/5 were measured with a tape and detailed sedimentary logs were recorded including frequent measurement of dip angles in order to calculate true thicknesses. Samples were collected at 5\u201310 m intervals from logged horizons. At each sampled horizon material was collected for acquisition of multi-proxy data, i.e. limestone blocks for SSF extraction, a fresh rock sample for bulk stable isotope (\u03b413C and \u03b418O) analysis and an oriented sample for thin section production. In total, 76 horizons were sampled over 161.55 m stratigraphic thickness in BAY4\/5 (Fig. 5) and 21 horizons were sampled (17 for stable isotope analysis and SSF extraction plus an extra 4 for SSF extraction only) in BAY1 over 155.8 m true thickness (Fig. 3). Macroscopic algae and trace fossils were also collected and their stratigraphic occurrences logged onto the section.\nMacrofossil samples were imaged with a Canon EOS 5D Mark III DSLR camera at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm (NRM) and with a Canon EOS 7D Mark II camera in the Institute of Palaeontology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar. Samples for shelly fossil extraction were digested in 5% acetic acid at the NRM following acetic maceration methodology of Jeppsson et al. (1999) and hand-picked fossils from the resulting insoluble residues were gold-coated and imaged at the NRM using a FEI Quanta FEG 650 Scanning Electron Microscope at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Uncoverslipped thin sections of samples from selected intervals were made at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia (UNE) and imaged with a Nikon 90i microscope controlled via NIS Elements software. Elemental maps of polished thin sections were produced with the Bruker M4 Tornado at Macquarie University. All specimens are stored at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (NRM).\n\n\n3.2\nStable isotope methods\nSamples for \u03b413C and \u03b418O isotope chemostratigraphy were collected simultaneously with shelly fossil and lithological samples through the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations. A total of 76 isotope samples were taken over 161.55 m stratigraphic thickness in BAY4\/5 and 17 samples in BAY1 (Figs 3,5; see Supplementary Information). Stable isotope analyses (carbon [\u03b413Ccarb] and oxygen [\u03b418Ocarb]) for BAY4\/5 were conducted at the Nanjing Institute of Palaeontology and Stratigraphy (NIGPAS) and for BAY1 at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Fresh surfaces of rock samples were carefully assessed prior to microdrilling to avoid weathering rinds, veins and other secondary textures. 1\u20132 g of powder from each sample was collected with a dental drill and each sample was analysed simultaneously for \u03b413C and \u03b418O data with a Thermo Scientific MAT-253 mass spectrometer with Kiel IV Carbonate Device. For each sample, an aliquot of 80 to 100 \u03bcg of powder was reacted with orthophosphoric acid for 150\u2013200 s at 72\u00b0C. The CO2 generated from this reaction gas was analyzed for \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb using a MAT-253 mass spectrometer. The VPDB standard (GBW-04405, with a \u03b413Ccarb value of 0.57 \u00b1 0.03\u2030 and a \u03b418Ocarb value of \u22128.49 \u00b1 0.13\u2030) was used for analytical calibration, with an analytical precision better than \u00b10.08\u2030 for \u03b413Ccarb and \u00b10.1\u2030 for \u03b418Ocarb values.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nLithology of the lower Zuun-Arts Formation\nIn Bayan Gol, the boundary between the Shuurgat Formation and the overlying Zuun-Arts Formation is defined by a karst surface. The BAY1 section commences at the top of this karst surface and intersects a 14.1 m thick (true thickness) dolostone that preserves columnar Boxonia grumulosa stromatolites (Fig. 3). In the BAY1 section, lowermost levels in the Zuun Arts Formation are frequently obscured by alluvium, however a distinctive 90 cm interval (true thickness) of black chert (phosphatic or phosphatised chert, Bold et al., 2013, Smith et al., 2016a and Adachi et al., 2019) occurs at BAY1\/42.3. Stratigraphically above the chert is a 5.2 m interval of poorly outcropping green, laminated shale. Above these levels, much of the lower Zuun Arts Formation is characterised by well-bedded, nodular, grey limestone with black siliceous balls and crusts developed on the surface. These textures do not persist in limestones intersected by the upper BAY1 section which tend to be thinly bedded and flaggy (Fig. 3).\n\n\n4.2\nLithology of the upper Zuun-Arts Formation\nLowermost levels in the BAY4 section are cross-bedded grainstones with sand-sized carbonate grains cemented by microspar (Fig. 6A). Carbonate grainstones give way to oolitic limestones at BAY4-7.0 (Fig. 6B). This level also includes darker clasts of reworked oolitic limestone. Levels with fine oolites and mottled, sub-rounded intraclasts are also characterised by secondary dissolution features such as stylolites and patchy dolomitisation (Fig. 6C\u2013D). Crossbedding, reworked carbonate grains and oolites give strong indication of a shallow-water marine depositional setting for the upper Zuun-Arts Formation.\n\nSmith et al. (2016a) defined the contact between the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations as a \u201csharp\u201d transition between ooid grainstone and microcrystalline phosphatic shale (pictured in Smith et al., 2016a, fig. 3D). Phosphatic deposits are often associated with drowning due to major transgressive events, and \u201cphosphatic shales\u201d have been documented near the bases of the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations (Macdonald et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2016a). However, in the present study, phosphate appears to be more readily associated with the carbonates of the upper Zuun-Arts Formation (and the chert in the lower Zuun-Arts Formation, Bold et al., 2013; Adachi et al., 2019) rather than with the lower Bayangol Formation. The interval from BAY4-13.0 to BAY4-17.5 (Figs 6E\u2013F) in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation is characterised by series of phosphatic crusts (Fig. 7A, B) interspersed through bioturbated micritic limestone that have conferred elevated preservation potential for SSF (clearly visible in hand sample, Figs 7C, 8\n) (Jacquet et al., 2019). Shelly fossils recovered from these levels include Protohertzina anabarica, P. unguliformis and Zuunia chimidtsereni (Figs 8, 9\n). These phosphatic deposits span >4 m of the upper parts of the BAY4 section suggesting that deposition of phosphate (and carbonate sediments) persisted for an extended period of time. Phosphate at these levels manifests as fine \u201cstringers\u201d, thick blackened crusts, undulating hardgrounds and reworked phosphatic pebbles in combination with brecciated limestones (Fig. 7A\u2013E). At BAY4-13.0 grey, mottled carbonates also include dispersed, rounded glauconite grains (Fig. 6E). Dissolution features are apparent, and glauconites feature recrystallized grain margins.\nStratigraphically lower levels in the Zuun-Arts Formation include well-developed phosphorites (Macdonald et al., 2009; Bold et al., 2016a, 2016b; Smith et al., 2016a), supporting the relationship between the Zuun-Arts Formation and deposition of phosphatic facies. While phosphorites are commonly interpreted as resulting from major transgressions, not all phosphatic facies may be indicative of drowned or deeper water settings. Extensive deposits of shallow water phosphorites in the Georgina Basin of Queensland and the Northern Territory of Australia are associated with carbonate textures similar to that seen in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation, in addition to the occurrence of glauconitic sediments (Southgate, 1988; Southgate and Shergold, 1991; Creveling et al., 2014). Relative proportion of phosphate in the Thorntonia Limestone in the Georgina Basin shows dramatic increase toward the upper levels immediately underlying the boundary with the Arthur Creek Formation (Southgate, 1988; Creveling et al., 2014). Similarly, phosphatic facies in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation become more frequent in the upper intervals immediately prior to deposition of the overlying Bayangol Formation, and were likely to have been deposited in a restricted shallow water palaeoenvironment conducive for development of ooid shoals, crossbedding and occasional breakup and redeposition of limestone and phosphatic material.\n\n\n4.3\nLithology of the lower Bayangol Formation\nThe boundary between the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations is considered to be a major sequence boundary based on the interpretation of phosphatic shales in the lower Bayangol Formation (Lindsay et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2016a). Previous work describes the lower Bayangol Formation as a mixed carbonate and siliciclastic succession (Lindsay et al., 1996) with phosphatic shale interbedded with nodular carbonate at the base (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Smith et al., 2016a). In contrast, we interpret phosphatic crusts, hardgrounds and stringers and reworked phosphatic pebbles as being associated with the carbonates of the underlying Zuun-Arts Formation with little to no phosphate detected in the lower Bayangol Formation. It is unclear why previous workers (e.g. Smith et al., 2016a) interpreted the \u201cshale\u201d in the lower Bayangol Formation as phosphatic, as no evidence has been presented to demonstrate this. Microfacies investigations and elemental mapping reveal that the lower Bayangol Formation actually represents a limestone-marl sequence and that the interbedded \u201cshales\u201d are of diagenetic origin (Figs 10C\u2013E). Limestone-marl deposits like that in the lower Bayangol Formation are common in carbonate settings. They display regular alternations between carbonate and marl (\u201cshaley\u201d) beds that appear to be the result of primary sedimentary processes oscillating between deposition of carbonate and siliciclastic muds. However, in many such sequences the marls between limestone layers are produced via carbonate dissolution during early diagenetic processes, with increased relative compaction of the marl occurring as sedimentation continues (Munnecke and Samtleben, 1996). Primary fabrics such as bedding may influence these processes and produce the rhythmic layering often seen in these deposits (Fig. 7G). Dissolution textures in the lower Bayangol Formation in BAY4\/5 are obvious in thin section (Fig. 10A\u2013C), and also via elemental mapping (Fig. 10D). Limestones in BAY5-8.0 contain only background levels of phosporous, while the supposedly phosphatic \u2018shales\u2019 do not contain detectable levels of phosphorous, instead showing elevation of elements like iron, silica and titanium, products likely mobilized during diagenesis (Fig. 10C, D). In addition to strong stylolitisation, microfabrics clearly show dolomitized brown marly intervals with a combination of diffuse boundaries, or boundaries that show anastomosing stylolite swarms penetrating surrounding mottled, grey micrite (Fig. 10A\u2013E; Fl\u00fcgel, 2010). For the most part, these intervals lack evidence for primary siliciclastic input such as quartz grains, indicating a carbonate-dominated depositional system rather than a carbonate system with regular siliciclastic input.\nIn the BAY4\/5 section, nodular limestones and marls are logged for 71.27 m from BAY5-2.7 to BAY5-111.5 (Figs 1,5,10). Shelly fossils are rare in this interval, perhaps due to the pervasive development of diagenetic marls. The siliciclastic component gradually increases upsection, with occasional sandy limestone beds cropping out as prominent benches at ~50 m above the base of the section. Intervals of well-developed flat pebble conglomerates also occur from ~50\u201375 m above the base of the section. Planolites and Psammichnites are recovered from silty limestones, 59.86 m and 81.57 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section (Fig 5, 12), but traces tend to be rare in the lowermost Bayangol Formation. Interpretation of this part of the succession as being carbonate-dominated as opposed to mixed carbonate and siliciclastic may explain the lack of well-developed ichnofossils (including T. pedum) at these levels. Probable algal filaments are also found at some silty levels in the lower Bayangol Formation (Fig. 13).\nAt BAY5\/111.5 (83.66 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section) there is an abrupt lithological change from limestone-marl alternations with occasional flat pebble conglomerates to massive limestone with clotted microbial textures (Figs 5, 10F,G). Microbial textures are consistent with Renalcis and Korilophyton, noted at similar levels in the Bayan Gol section by Adachi et al. (2021). Abundant dissolution-compaction features characterise these massive to thickly-bedded limestones (Fig. 10G). Grainstone textures occur with microbial clots at BAY5-131.0, 103.16 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section (Fig. 10H). These give way to fine oolites and pellets coated by micritic envelopes at BAY5-149.4, 121.56 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section (Fig. 10I, J). Aggregations of oolites and pellets form grapestone and carbonate lump textures at BAY5-150.1 (Fig. 10K, L). Development of pellets, oolites and grapestone textures suggests a relatively shallow water, low-moderate energy palaeoenvironment that experienced periods of nondeposition or reduced sedimentation rates (Fl\u00fcgel, 2010).\nA 14 m thick (true thickness) strongly stylotised and pseudobedded interval occurs in the BAY5 section from BAY5-146 to BAY5-160. This interval features pervasive dolomitisation that obliterates original carbonate fabrics (Fig. 11A). Dolomitisation fronts are also visible in granular micritic limestones at BAY5-177 (Fig. 11B). Limestone with abundant, irregularly shaped reworked carbonate grains occurs at BAY5-196.5, 149.84 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section (Fig. 11C). Grain interiors may be micritic, or contain fine dark stippling, and are delineated from the micritic matrix by micritic envelopes or limonitised or hematised rinds (Fig. 11D\u2013H). SSF were clearly observed in handsample at this level and have been recovered from acid residues. Taxa include abundant siphogonochitids such as Siphogonochites triangularis and Lophochites latazonalis that represent the originally calcareous sclerites of multi-element organisms (Figs. 5, 14). Specimens retrieved from acid residues have been replaced or coated by bacterially-mediated phosphate. Disarticulation, abrasion and reworking of such shelly material is likely to be responsible for lithological textures observed at this horizon (BAY5-196.5, Fig. 11C\u2013H). Possible shelly debris also occurs in BAY5-197.2, though strong dolomitisation and stylolitisation has destroyed much of the original fabric (Fig. 11I\u2013K). A ~50 cm interval of bedded red and green silty carbonates occurs at BAY5-219.0, 160.57 above the base of the BAY4\/5 section. This gives way to clotted, grey microbial limestones, and development of large (~40 cm diameter) domical stromatolites (BAY5-221.2 to BAY5-222.8) (Fig. 5). A thin, yellowed crust overlying these stromatolites contains abundant fine, dark, elongate structures observable in hand sample. In thin section, these structures have diffuse boundaries with granular interiors, often containing fine angular quartz (Fig. 11L, N), suggestive of burrow infills. Tubular shelly debris also occurs at BAY5-222.8, and cross sections are observable in thin section (Fig. 11M). Incorporation of siliciclastic material at BAY5-222.8 is consistent with the development of thick sandstone and shale intervals stratigraphically above this level (in a measured section complementing, but outside the scope of the present study).\n\n\n4.4\nNew interpretation of the Bayan Gol sequence\nLithological and microfacies data presented herein demonstrate that the upper Zuun-Arts Formation and the lower Bayangol Formation were both deposited in a relatively shallow, predominantly carbonate palaeoenvironment. This contrasts with previous interpretations that cite a major shift in sedimentation style at this boundary from a carbonate grainstone to mixed carbonates and siliciclastics. Sequence stratigraphic approaches differ between siliciclastic and carbonate successions (Fl\u00fcgel, 2010). In carbonate successions sequence boundaries can be characterised by hardgrounds, crusts and breccias that indicate transgressive flooding surfaces (Fl\u00fcgel, 2010). Development of phosphatic hardgrounds in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation indicates periodic sedimentary quiescence. The transition from carbonate grainstones with abundant phosphatic textures and a thick, blackened phosphatic crust at BAY4-13 (=BAY5-0) to a limestone-marl sequence at BAY5-3.3 most likely indicates a sequence boundary between the upper Zuun-Arts Formation (highstand systems tract) and the lower Bayangol Formation (transgressive systems tract). While it is difficult to determine the length of time captured within a single phosphatic hardground, continuation of carbonate-dominated sedimentation, rather than sudden influx of terrestrial detritus, in addition to the continuation of stratigraphic ranges of species of SSF across this boundary suggest that the time break at the boundary between the Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations is likely to be minimal.\n\n\n4.5\nBiostratigraphy\nThe only skeletal fossils in the BAY1 section occur within a 2.4 m thick interval (between BAY1\/104 and BAY1\/107.8) and consist of poorly preserved annulated tubular fossils identified as Zuunia chimidtsereni, recently described from the basal Zuun-Arts Formation at Bayan Gol (Yang et al., 2020) and a few other poorly preserved tubular fossils (Fig. 4). The first skeletal fossils in the BAY4\/5 section occur in association with phosphatic hardgrounds in the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation (11.35 m true thickness from the base of the section, BAY4-13). Here protoconodont elements (Fig. 9A\u2013J) occur with abundant Zuunia chimidtsereni (Fig. 9K\u2013S). Zuunia chimidtsereni from this level are frequently preserved in three dimensions (Fig. 9K\u2013M), sometimes with a perfectly circular cross section but are more often partly compressed with a wrinkled surface and partial detachment of subsequent growth increments (Fig. 9Q\u2013S), suggesting soft deformation of a poorly mineralized or organic wall. As discussed by Yang et al. (2020), these tubes are closely comparable to cloudinids, common fossils from the late Ediacaran (Selly et al., 2020). Associated protoconodonts are represented by slender, recurved spine-like cones with a pointed apex. Most specimens show a well-developed median ridge on the concave side and a shallow basal furrow on the convex side (Fig. 9A\u2013J). Material includes specimens with a relatively wide base attributable to Protohertzina anabarica and slender, laterally compressed specimens comparable with P. unguliformis. Protohertzina anabarica and P. unguliformis are usually reported as separate species (e.g., Missarzhevsky, 1973; Qian and Bengston, 1989). However, Kouchinsky et al. (2017) suggested that both forms in lower Fortunian strata are likely to belong to one apparatus and grouped them under P. anabarica (although still designating P. unguliformis-type sclerites). While both taxa have a global distribution and frequently occur together in early Cambrian SSF assemblages, Kouchinsky et al. (2017) note that the topotype material of P. unguliformis from the Tommotian-aged basal Pestrotsvet Formation is significantly younger. Herein, we follow Kouchinsky et al. (2017) and consider it most likely that protoconodont elements from the lower Bayangol Formation belong to the same apparatus and suggest that they fit within the concept of P. anabarica. However, pending formal synonymy, for biostratigraphic clarification we distinguish occurrences of P. unguliformis-type elements in our biostratigraphic range chart (Fig. 5).\nIn the overlying limestone-marls of the lowermost Bayangol Formation, shelly fossils are less common but specimens of Protohertzina occur at 52.58 m and 62.97 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation. The last occurrence of Zuunia is at 62.97 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation. A low diversity trace fossil assemblage is found in the clastic-influenced interval between 45\u201380 m and include forms comparable to Planolites and Psammichnites, common in Cambrian deposits (Figs 5, 12\n).\nIn the overlying massive microbial carbonates (83.66 m to 149.87 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation), shelly fossils are initially rare but diversity increases dramatically towards the upper levels. Protohertzina anabarica (including P. unguliformis-type sclerites) ranges throughout this part of the section. The first occurrence of Anabarites trisulcatus, Cambrotubulus decurvatus and Siphogonochites triangularis are at 122.26 (BAY5\/150.1) meters true thickness above the base of the BAY4\/5 section, while Lopochites latazonalis, Halkieria sp. and Maikhanella multa occur at 149.16 m (BAY5\/177; Figs 5, 14) and Mongolodus rostriformis and Dabashanites mirus occur at 149.86 m of the BAY4\/5 section (BAY5\/196.5). This fauna ranges into strata associated with the domal stromatolites at the top of the section where they occur together with the star-shaped trace fossil Spatangopsis mongolica (Fig. 15).\nFossil fauna documented here from the upper Zuun-Arts and lower Bayangol formations give both Ediacaran and Cambrian biostratigraphic signals. The lower BAY4\/5 section captures a Zuunia-Protohertzina skeletal assemblage suggestive of Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian ages, in addition to an unquestionably Cambrian\u2013aged assemblage that includes anabaritids, siphogonochitids, Halkieria, Maikhanella and Mongolodus at stratigraphically higher levels.\n\n\n4.6\nChemostratigraphy\nThe \u03b413C profile of the lower Zuun-Arts Formation shows gradually decreasing \u03b413C values from +3.23\u2030 near the base of the formation to -5.7\u2030 at BAY1\/226.1 m, 155.8 m true thickness above the section base (Fig. 3). This overall decline in \u03b413C values is interrupted by a peak of +3.27\u2030 at BAY1\/164.3 m, 112.1 true thickness above the section base of BAY1 (Fig. 3).\nStrongly negative \u03b413C values occur in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation (\u201310.2\u2030 at BAY4\/1.5, true thickness of 1.5 m above the base of the BAY4\/5 section; Fig. 5). \u03b413C values gradually become more positive upsection, culminating in a positive peak (2.9\u2030 at BAY5\/51.4) in the lower Bayangol Formation, 39.55 m true thickness from base (Fig. 5). \u03b413C values gradually become more negative over the next ~35 m, dropping to \u20135.4\u2030 at BAY5\/98 m, 73.79 m true thickness from base (Fig. 5). \u03b413C values over the remainder of the section are negative, but exhibit a gradual climb toward 0.0\u2030 in the upper parts of the section (Fig. 5).\n\n\n\n5\nThe E-C boundary at Bayan Gol\nStudies over the last 25 years have generally agreed on the approximate placement on the E\u2013C boundary in Bayan Gol. Brasier et al. (1996a, 1996b) placed the E\u2013C boundary proximal to the base of the Bayangol Formation using ichnofossil assemblages, and Smith et al. (2016a) reached a similar conclusion based primarily on chemostratigraphic data. This position of the E\u2013C boundary has also been tentatively adopted in more recent studies (Yang et al., 2020; Adachi et al., 2021). However, in Bayan Gol, chemostratigraphic markers, the FO of key shelly fossils and the FO of the index fossil T. pedum are seemingly at odds, and recognition of the E-C boundary in Bayan Gol is reliant on proxies that are not incorporated into the current definition of the boundary at the GSSP (Voronin et al., 1982; Brasier et al., 1996b; Goldring and Jensen, 1996; Smith et al., 2016a, 2017; Landing and Kruse, 2017).\nTrace fossils have limited utility in the Zavkhan Basin for delineating the base of the Cambrian due to the delayed appearance of T. pedum (the FO of the species is in \u2018unit 20\u2019 in Bayan Gol, ~250 m above the base of the Bayangol Formation; Goldring and Jensen, 1996), highlighting the importance of SSF biostratigraphical data. Collection of new SSF data from these sections is crucial as previous work is either fraught with mapping and correlation errors (described above, Brasier et al., 1996b), or does not document fossil taxa and their occurrences in adequate detail (Smith et al., 2016a). Smith et al. (2016a) collated a vast amount of palaeontological data from Mongolian sections measured by previous workers (e.g., Korobov and Missarzhevsky, 1977; Voronin et al., 1982; Endonzhamts and Lkhasuren, 1988; Zhegallo and Zhuravlev, 1991; Dorjnamjaa et al., 1993; Brasier et al., 1996b; Esakova and Zhegallo, 1996). However, uncertainties surrounding the provenance of many of these samples, and developments in shelly fossil palaeobiology that have prompted taxonomic revisions for key taxa render old biostratigraphic data unreliable.\nThe marriage of shelly fossil biostratigraphic data and \u03b413C chemostratigraphic data is key for putting regional Cambrian successions in a global context. The first skeletal faunas (including the protoconodont Protohertzina anabarica) appear 9.85 m above the nadir of the negative excursion in the Zuun-Arts Formation (2.12 m below base of the Bayangol Formation). The occurrence of Protohertzina in combination with the cloudinid Zuunia chimidtsereni (an Ediacaran\u2013Fortunian taxon; Yang et al., 2020) in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation corroborates earlier suggestions that the strongly negative \u03b413C values in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation represent the BACE (\u201310.2\u2030 at 10.46 m below the base of the Bayangol Formation, Fig. 5). The BAY4\/5 section was measured through continuous strata on a single fault block and therefore only captures the nadir and upper part of the excursion, while the BAY1 section likely captures the lower part of the BACE (Fig. 3).\nThe BACE is recognized globally and has been used in the absence of a reliable FO of T. pedum as a proxy for defining the base of the Cambrian (see Zhu et al., 2019 and more discussion below). The close temporal relationship between the FO of Protohertzina and the nadir of the BACE in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation indicates that the E\u2013C boundary in Bayan Gol occurs in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation. Herein, we place the E\u2013C boundary at 10.46 m below the contact with the overlying Bayangol Formation, corresponding with the nadir of the BACE (Fig. 5).\n\n\n6\nChronostratigraphic markers for the E-C boundary\nIdentification of the E\u2013C boundary in Bayan Gol herein (i.e. coinciding with the nadir of the BACE) has been achieved using proxies not present at the Cambrian GSSP at Fortune Head in Newfoundland, preventing direct correlation between Bayan Gol and the global stratotype section. Similar situations are encountered on most palaeoncontinents and clearly demonstrate the profound difficulties with reliably defining the base of the Cambrian around the world (Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Yang et al., 2014a, 2016; Zhu et al., 2017, 2019; Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Yang and Steiner, 2021). We address the advantages and shortcomings of the Cambrian GSSP at Fortune Head and explore additional chronostratigraphic markers that may provide a practical solution to problems that plague global correlation of one of the most significant chronostratigraphic boundaries in the geological timescale.\n\n6.1\nThe trouble with Treptichnus\n\n6.1.1\nThe current GSSP definition\nThe E\u2013C boundary is defined by the first appearance of the ichnofossil Treptichnus pedum (Narbonne et al., 1987; Brasier et al., 1994; Landing, 1994). At the stratotype section at Fortune Head in Newfoundland the Cambrian GSSP is marked at a point 2.3 m above the base of Member 2A (now incorporated in the Quaco Road Member) of the Chapel Island Formation (Fig. 16; Narbonne et al., 1987; Brasier et al., 1994; Landing, 1994; Landing, 1996). This horizon additionally marks the base of the T. pedum Ichnofosssil Assemblage Zone (Narbonne et al., 1987; Babcock et al., 2014). Global correlation of the GSSP can be achieved by either identifying the first appearance of T. pedum or other biostratigraphic ichnofossil indicators of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone, such as Skolithos annulatus, Arenicolites sp., Monomorphichnus spp., Conichus conicus, Phycodes sp. or Helminthopsis tenius that all occur within 2 m of the GSSP (see Landing, 1994; Peng et al., 2012; Babcock et al., 2014).\n\n\n6.1.2\n\nThe drawbacks of T. pedum\nThe selection of T. pedum to mark the base of the Cambrian has been extensively criticised (Rozanov et al., 1997; Zhu, 1997; Zhu et al., 2001, 2019; Qian et al., 2002; Peng and Babcock, 2011; Babcock et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2016a). On one hand, T. pedum is a relatively distinct ichnotaxon (Babcock et al., 2014; Buatois, 2018) that has a near cosmopolitan distribution in the Cambrian (Gehling et al., 2001; Landing et al., 2013). Its presence has been useful for recognizing basal Cambrian strata across the globe (Figs 16-17\n\n; Narbonne et al., 1994; Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003; Gehling et al., 2001; Sour-Tovar et al., 2007; Loyd et al., 2012; Landing et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2016b; Linnemann et al., 2019; Hodgin et al., 2021; Bowyer et al., 2022) and although new, morphologically complex trace fossils continue to be reported from Ediacaran strata (e.g. Smith et al., 2016b; Oji et al., 2018; Tarhan et al., 2020), the sediment-penetrating behaviour of T. pedum is iconic of the animal-substrate interactions that characterize the Cambrian radiation (Buatois, 2018).\nOn the other hand, the deficiencies of employing the FAD of T. pedum to define the base of the Cambrian have been noted repeatedly (Peng and Babcock, 2011; Babcock et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019). Critics have questioned its stratigraphic distribution, uncertain taxonomic history and behavioural significance (Dzik, 2005; Vannier et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2012; Babcock et al., 2014; Buatois, 2018). The efficacy of T. pedum as a chronostratigraphic marker was further undermined when it was discovered 4.41 m below the E\u2013C boundary in the section at Fortune Head where the GSSP was established (Gehling et al., 2001). Some saw this as a major problem (e.g., Peng and Babcock, 2011), while others considered this occurrence to fall within acceptable confidence intervals (Landing et al., 2013). To compensate for the discrepancy, Landing et al. (2013) suggested redefining the Cambrian GSSP to correspond with the base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone rather than the FAD of T. pedum itself. The base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone is defined immediately above the last occurrences of the enigmatic Harlaniella podolica\nSokolov, 1972 and Palaeopascichnus delicatus Palij, 1976 with the first occurrence of T. pedum now slightly below this boundary (Landing et al., 2013). This revised interpretation has been met with some resistance by critics that suggest this only further complicates the identification of the base of the Cambrian (Babcock et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019).\nPerhaps the most significant complication when employing T. pedum for global correlation is that of facies dependence (Geyer and Uchman, 1995; Gehling et al., 2001; Geyer, 2005; Babcock et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019). Many trace fossils (including T. pedum) are predominantly confined to siliciclastic rocks, and although it has been noted that T. pedum occurs in a range of lithofacies (Landing et al., 2013; Buatois et al., 2013; Buatois, 2018) these do not typically include carbonate settings. This lithofacies dependence dramatically reduces the application of T. pedum as a proxy for the base of the Cambrian, as in many key regions this interval captures predominantly carbonate facies, e.g., China, Kazakhstan, Siberia and Mongolia. Facies restriction may explain the delayed appearance of T. pedum in some E\u2013C sections (Buatois et al., 2013; Buatois, 2018) such as Bayan Gol herein. Likewise, traces associated with the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone such as Skolithos annulatus or Arenicolites sp. are also facies dependent. Other ichnotaxa such as H. podolica and P. delicatus have limited palaeogeographical distribution (Zhu et al., 2019) and also appear to be largely restricted to siliciclastic settings and are hence unlikely to be reliable markers for the base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone, or robust alternative markers for the base of the Cambrian.\n\n\n6.1.3\n\nWhere is T. pedum a useful marker?\n\nNevertheless, the use of T. pedum and the Fortune Head GSSP has been staunchly defended (Gehling et al., 2001; Landing et al., 2013; Geyer and Landing, 2017; Buatois, 2018). Recognition of the E\u2013C boundary in Namibia, northwestern Canada, the Great Basin, Norway, central England and Australia is often presented as evidence that T. pedum is an effective global marker (Gehling et al., 2001, p. 214; Landing et al., 2013, p.145). However, it is clear that the occurrences of T. pedum in some of these locations do not closely correlate with the Cambrian GSSP at Fortune Head. In the Arrowie Basin in South Australia, the first occurrence of T. pedum occurs approximately 200 m above the proposed E\u2013C boundary (Jensen et al., 1998; Zang et al., 2007; Jago et al., 2006, 2020) and 50 m above the proposed boundary in the Amadeus Basin in central Australia (McIlroy et al., 1997). The boundary in both basins is disputed, complicated by the presence of a major unconformity (Zang et al., 2007; Jago et al., 2006, 2020). Nevertheless, as the first occurrence of T. pedum is above Treptichnus coronatum in the Arrowie Basin (Jensen et al., 1998; Zang et al., 2007) and above Rusophycus in the Amadeus Basin (McIlroy et al., 1997), the FO of T. pedum in Australia clearly does not define the E\u2013C boundary (McIlroy et al., 1997; Gehling, 2000; Jago et al., 2006, 2012; Gehling and Droser, 2012; Shahkarami et al., 2020).\nIn Namibia, traces that\u00a0have\u00a0similar morphology and complexity to\u00a0T.\u00a0pedum such as\u00a0Streptichnus narbonnei\u00a0occur in the upper Spitskop Member, 14 m below the unconformable contact with the overlying Nomtsas Formation (Fig. 16;\u00a0Linnemann et al., 2019, fig. 3). However, the first unambiguous occurrence of T. pedum is in the lower Nomtsas Formation, where the E\u2013C boundary is currently placed (Fig. 16; Germs, 1972; Wilson et al., 2012; Linnemann et al., 2019; Bowyer et al., 2022). An ash bed in the Nomtsas Formation provides a maximum age of 538.8 Ma for T.\u00a0pedum (Bowyer et al., 2022), however, this has been challenged by recent suggestions that the boundary may be >1 m.y. younger than currently recognized (Nelson et al., 2022). In central England, T. pedum\u00a0has not been reported and correlation with the GSSP is based on the presence of the ichnotaxon Teichichnus (Bland and Goldring, 1995; McIlroy et al., 1998; Landing et al., 2013). McIlroy et al. (1998) correlated the Teichichnus bearing beds in the Swithland Formation with the Teichichnus ichnozone of Newfoundland (Landing, 1992), that occurs some 250 m above the GSSP (McIlroy et al., 1998).\nThe application of T. pedum to reliably recognize the E\u2013C boundary works best in predominantly siliciclastic successions (Fig. 16), such as Finnmark in northern Norway (H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m et al., 2013), southeastern Poland (Moczyd\u0142owska, 2008) and some regions in North America (e.g., Narbonne et al., 1994; Corsetti and Kaufman, 1994; Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003; Smith et al., 2016b; Tarhan et al., 2020). Trace fossils provide the main age constraint on the succession in Finnmark (Fig. 16). Here, Palaeopascichnus occurs below T. pedum, and the first occurrence of T. pedum is associated with trilobed traces indicative of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone (H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Jensen et al., 2018). These data suggest that the E\u2013C boundary is most likely in the upper portion of the Manndrapererlva Member of the St\u00e1hpo\u00f3gieddi Formation (Fig. 16; H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Jensen et al., 2018). However, correlation on a broader scale is challenging as complementary data is not available (e.g., chemostratigraphic or skeletal fossil markers). On the Lublin slope in southeastern Poland, the FO of\u00a0T.\u00a0pedum\u00a0is in the lower Mazowsze Formation (Fig. 16; Strauss et al, 1997; Moczyd\u0142owska, 2008). However, the E\u2013C boundary on the Lublin slope is not defined by the ichnotaxon but rather the FO of Cambrian acritarch species in the\u00a0uppermost part of the underlying W\u0142odawa Formation (Fig. 16; Strauss et al., 1997; Moczyd\u0142owska, 2008). Although acritarchs have been employed on the Lublin slope to delineate the E\u2013C boundary, the temporal and spatial relationship of acritarch assemblages with the FO of T.\u00a0pedum on a global scale has not been evaluated. Consequently the E\u2013C boundary on the Lublin slope remains under discussion.\nIn the Great Basin (Corsetti and Kaufman, 1994; Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003, Ahn et al., 2012; Loyd et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016b; Tarhan et al., 2020), Mexico (Hodgin et al., 2021) and the Mackenzie Mountains of northwest Canada (Narbonne et al., 1994; Narbonne and Aitken, 1995; Carbone and Narbonne, 2014) there is a close association between the first occurrence of T. pedum with the upper part (post nadir) of the BACE (Fig. 17). However, it is not possible to establish whether these sections may be correlated with the stratotype due to the lack of chemostratigraphic or skeletal biostratigraphic data from the siliciclastic-dominated Fortune Head. Although negative \u03b413Corg values have been recorded from the Chapel Island Formation (Fig. 16; Hantsoo et al., 2018), these values represent organic carbon and not inorganic carbonate carbon isotopes. The relationship between carbonate and organic \u03b413C values is not clear (e.g., Kump and Arthur, 1999; Oehlert and Swart, 2014). Hence, chemostratigraphic excursions in organic carbon (\u03b413Corg) isotope curves obtained through the Newfoundland GSSP section (Fig. 16; Hantsoo et al., 2018) may not be equivalent to the BACE observed in carbonate carbon (\u03b413Ccarb) isotope curves elsewhere.. Using the base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone rather than T. pedum, for correlation, as proposed by Landing et al. (2013) does not enhance correlation, as neither Harlaniella or Palaeopascichnus have been documented from these sections (Narbonne and Aitken, 1995; Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003, Carbone and Narbonne, 2014; Smith et al., 2016b; Kolesnikov, 2019; Tarhan et al., 2020; Hodgin et al., 2021).\n\n\n6.1.4\nT. pedum is an inadequate correlative marker\n\nThe combination of facies dependence and insufficient correlative markers at the stratotype section places serious limitations on the ability to correlate globally using either the FAD of T. pedum or the base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil assemblage Zone from the GSSP on Fortune Head. It is clear that while T. pedum may have proven its utility in identifying Lower Cambrian strata around the globe, as an unambiguous global marker for the E\u2013C boundary it is inadequate.\n\n\n\n6.2\n\nThe potential of Protohertzina\n\n6.2.1\nSmall Shelly Fossils\nSkeletal faunas from the earliest Cambrian are dominated by various tubes, plates, shells and spines that represent a wide range of animal groups (e.g., Bengtson et al., 1990; Dzik, 1994; Skovsted, 2006; Steiner et al., 2007; Topper et al., 2009; Kouchinsky et al., 2012, 2017; Skovsted et al., 2015; Betts et al., 2016, 2017b). Collectively, these fossils are often referred to as \u2018small shelly fossils\u2019 (SSF) or \u2018early skeletal fossils\u2019 (ESF) and are typically obtained through the dissolution of carbonate rocks in weak acids (Matthews and Missarzhevsky, 1975; Bengtson et al., 1990; Bengtson, 2004; Skovsted, 2006; Topper et al., 2009; Geyer and Landing, 2017). This informal group includes the oldest known representatives of some well-known clades, such as Mollusca and Brachiopoda (Skovsted, 2006; Topper et al., 2013; Li et al., 2019) and also many problematic fossils, that now appear to belong to the stem groups of a range of modern lineages (Szaniawski, 2002; Vinther and Nielsen, 2005; Skovsted et al., 2008, 2009, 2011; Larsson et al., 2014). While the oldest skeletal assemblages emerge towards the end of the Ediacaran (e.g., Schiffbauer et al., 2016), it is not until the Cambrian (Terreneuvian through to Cambrian Stage 4) that the taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity of skeletal taxa spectacularly and exponentially increases (Li et al., 2007; Steiner et al., 2007; Kouchinsky et al., 2012; Wood et al., 2019). The discovery of SSF had an immediate impact on the concept of the E\u2013C boundary, highlighting biomineralisation by complex animals as a hallmark of the Cambrian radiation (Rozanov, 1967; Rozanov et al., 1969). However, it was the dominance of SSFs in pre-trilobitic strata (e.g., Rozanov and Missarzhevsky, 1966; Rozanov et al., 1969) that piqued the interest of the Cambrian Subcommission, and the first appearance of diverse skeletal assemblages formed the basis of E\u2013C GSSP proposals for candidate sections in Siberia and China (Cowie and Rozanov, 1983; Luo et al., 1984; Narbonne et al., 1987; Landing, 1994).\nAt the time these sections were proposed, SSF were generally considered to have only limited utility for biostratigraphy and correlation (Landing, 1994). Most taxa were regarded as strongly provincial, facies dependent, stratigraphically long-ranging and with taxonomy that suffered from uncertainty due to disarticulated elements (Qian and Bengston, 1989; Landing et al., 1989; Landing, 1994; Landing et al., 2013). However, continued work on Cambrian skeletal assemblages has dramatically improved our understanding of their palaeobiology, phylogenetic relationships and their stratigraphic ranges and distribution (Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Li et al., 2007; Devaere et al., 2013, 2021; Yang et al., 2014a, 2016; Betts et al., 2016, 2017b; Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Yang and Steiner, 2021). While faunal provincialism continues to be prevalent in Cambrian successions, many skeletal taxa are now known to have had a cosmopolitan distribution (Wrona, 2004; Skovsted, 2006; Topper et al., 2009; Devaere et al., 2013, 2021; Betts et al., 2016, 2017b; Kouchinsky et al., 2017), demonstrating their utility as tools for biostratigraphy and global correlation.\n\n\n6.2.2\nEdiacaran and Cambrian skeletal faunas \u2014 do they overlap?\nSkeletal assemblages in lowermost Cambrian successions are typically low diversity, and tend to be dominated by tubular and spine-shaped fossils (Fig. 9). The triradially symmetrical tubular organism, Anabarites trisulcatus Missarzhevsky in Voronova and Missarzhevsky, 1969 is ubiquitous in lower Cambrian carbonate successions globally. Anabarites has been a key taxon for recognizing early Cambrian strata, with the Anabarites trisulcatus Zone proposed for the base of the Nemakit-Daldyn Formation in Siberia (Savitsky, 1978; Missarzhevsky, 1982; Zhamoida and Petrov, 2008; Kouchinsky et al., 2017) and the Anabarites trisulcatus\u2013Protohertzina anabarica Assemblage Zone recognized as the earliest Cambrian biozone in South China (Qian et al., 1996; Steiner et al., 2007).\nEdiacaran and Cambrian biotas have previously been considered taxonomically distinct (e.g., Grant, 1990; Amthor et al., 2003), with cloudiniids an exclusively Ediacaran group (Grant, 1990) and Anabarites a decisive indicator of Cambrian strata (Missarzhevsky, 1982; Steiner et al., 2007; Zhamoida and Petrov, 2008; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). However, recent reports of mixed Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian assemblages have blurred this transition (Vidal et al., 1994; Zhuravlev et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017; Wood et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019). Cloudiniids and Anabarites co-occur in Kazakhstan (Yang et al., 2016), China (Yang et al., 2016) and Siberia (Zhuravlev et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2017). Cloudiniids have also been found in strata above the nadir of the BACE (Yang et al., 2016; Stammeier et al., 2019; Fig. 18\n) and Anabarites occurs below the nadir of the BACE (Cai et al., 2019). This has led to the suggestion that the taxonomic turnover between Ediacaran and Cambrian biotas may have been overestimated and the skeletal faunas of the latest Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian therefore represent a continuous evolutionary progression (Zhu et al., 2017; Zhuravlev and Wood, 2018; Wood et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019; Bowyer et al., 2022).\nStratigraphic overlap of what was previously considered exclusively Ediacaran and Cambrian taxa complicates the application of SSF to define the base of the Cambrian, and the discovery of Anabarites in terminal Ediacaran strata appears to have given rise to skepticism regarding the biostratigraphic utility of skeletal taxa in defining the E\u2013C boundary (see Landing et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017). However, the extension of fossils into unfamiliar stratigraphic territory is in reality restricted to only a handful of taxa, notably cloudinids and other tubular forms like Cambrotubulus and Anabarites. Even A. trisulcatus, which is now frequently considered an Ediacaran taxon has only been convincingly shown in Ediacaran strata (based on our boundary definition) at the top of the Dengying Formation in Lijiagou by Cai et al. (2019) where it occurs just below the nadir of the BACE. Siberian records of A. trisulcatus in Ediacaran strata are based on misinterpreted \u03b413C profiles (Zhu et al., 2017; Bowyer et al., 2022; see discussion below), inaccurate definition of the lower boundary of the A. trisulcatus Zone (Rogov et al., 2015; Nagovitsin et al., 2015; Kouchinsky et al., 2017) and U-Pb zircon dates (Bowring et al., 1993) that likely need to be revisited, given the advances in zircon preparation and recalibration of standards (Schmitz, 2012; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). The unclear stratigraphic position of anabaritids and cloudiniids indicates that they should be avoided as primary biostratigraphic tools for the base of the Cambrian. Furthermore, these tubular forms are secondarily phosphatized (Yang et al., 2020) and are consequently highly facies dependent and are therefore unreliable as index fossils (Pruss et al., 2018; Freeman et al., 2019; Jacquet et al., 2019).\n\n\n6.2.3\nThe advantages of Protohertzina\nPrimarily phosphatic SSF are not subject to the taphonomic biases that affect calcareous taxa. The early Cambrian protoconodont Protohertzina for example, has original phosphatic skeletal material and is a biostratigraphically valuable shelly fossil taxon that is already widely applied for global correlation. Protoconodonts (or pseudoconodonts; see Landing and Murphy, 1991) are primary organo-phosphatic spiniform sclerites that have been interpreted as the grasping spines of chaetognaths (Szaniawski, 1982, 2002; Bengtson, 1983; Vannier et al., 2007). The spinose sclerites of Protohertzina were first discovered in Siberia in the early 1970s where two species, P. anabarites (from the lowermost Fortunian Stage) and P. unguliformis (from younger Tommotian-aged strata) were originally described (Missarzhevsky, 1973). They are distinct and are easily recognizable amongst the tubular fossils that tend to dominate skeletal assemblages in the early Cambrian. Likely due to a pelagic lifestyle, Protohertzina had a near cosmopolitan distribution in lower Cambrian strata and occurs in numerous sections across the Siberian Platform (Kouchinsky et al., 2017), South China (Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Yang et al., 2014a, 2016), Kazakhstan (Yang et al., 2014a), northwestern Canada (Pyle et al., 2006), Iran (Hamdi et al., 1989; Shahkarami et al., 2017; Devaere et al., 2021), India (Braiser and Singh, 1987), Avalonia (Landing et al., 1989) Australia (Betts et al., 2016) and Mongolia (Esakova and Zhegallo, 1996; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; herein). Protohertzina has a relatively wide environmental tolerance having been reported across shallow and deeper shelf settings (Steiner et al., 2007; Kouchinsky et al., 2017) and although predominantly confined to carbonate rocks, the taxon has also been recovered from cherts and siliciclastic deposits (McIlroy and Szaniawski, 2000; Yang et al., 2014b).\n\n\n6.2.4\n\nWhere is Protohertzina a useful marker?\n\n\nProtohertzina is used to indicate basal Cambrian strata globally (Steiner et al., 2007; Geyer, 2019). For instance, the first occurrence of Protohertzina has been employed to help place the E\u2013C boundary in the Alborz Mountains of Iran (Fig. 18;\nHamdi et al., 1989; Shahkarami et al., 2017; Fig. 18;\nShahkarami et al., 2020) and the Mackenzie Mountains in northwest Canada (Fig. 17;\nNarbonne et al., 1994; Pyle et al., 2006). Protohertzina forms a key element in the oldest shelly fossil assemblages in Siberia and South China\u2014regions that host perhaps the most extensive and richly fossiliferous Fortunian strata in the world (Figs 19, 20).\nIn Siberia, Protohertzina anabarica is part of the Anabarites trisulcatus Zone, typically first occurring above the FO of A. trisulcatus. It has been documented across the Siberian Platform, including from the Syhargalakh Formation of the Olenek Uplift, the Ust\u2019Yudoma Formation in eastern Siberia and the Nemakit-Daldyn Formation in the Anabar Uplift (Figure 19; see Kouchinsky et al., 2012, 2017). In South China, the first occurrence of P. anabarica (or the likely junior synonym P. unguliformis) defines the base of the Anabarites trisulcatus \u2013 Protohertzina anabarica Assemblage Zone (Steiner et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2014a). The Anabarites trisulcatus \u2013 Protohertzina anabarica Assemblage Zone has been identified from the majority of carbonate platforms in South China, such as the Maidiping Formation in central Sichuan, the lower Kuanchuanpu Formation in south Shaanxi, the Yanjiahe Formation in Hubei and the Zhongyicun Member of the Zhuijaqing Formation across the Yangtze Platform (Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Guo et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014a, 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021; Fig. 20). The base of both the Anabarites trisulcatus Zone in Siberia and the Anabarites trisulcatus\u2013Protohertzina anabarica Zone in South China are considered to approximately coincide with the base of the Cambrian in their respective regions (Steiner et al., 2007, 2020; Zhu et al., 2017; Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Geyer, 2019).\n\n\n6.2.5\nProtohertzina and the BACE\n\nOne advantage of employing skeletal fossils as tools for global correlation is that as they predominantly occur in carbonate rocks, chemostratigraphic records can also be obtained, providing an auxiliary means to strengthen correlation. The integration of biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data has become increasingly applied in Cambrian studies (Betts et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2020) and many key stratigraphic sections that were initially sampled for skeletal taxa have now been studied for chemostratigraphic purposes (Li et al., 2009, 2013; Smith et al., 2016a; Betts et al., 2018). Consequently, the relationship between prominent perturbations in the \u03b413C profile and the first appearances and stratigraphic ranges of key skeletal taxa are becoming clear.\nIn many successions around the globe the first occurrence of Protohertzina is closely associated with the BACE. In eastern Siberia, the first occurrence of Protohertzina is approximately 60\u201375 m above the nadir of the BACE (excursion \u2018N\u2019 of Braiser et al., 1993) in the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation, approximately 82 m below the contact with the Pestrotsvet Formation (Khomentovsky and Karlova, 1992; Braiser et al., 1993; Kouchinsky et al., 2007, 2012). In the western Anabar region (Kotujkan section) in northern Siberia Protohertzina has been recovered from the basal Manykaj Formation (Khomentovsky and Karlova, 1992, 1993), approximately 40 m above the nadir of the BACE (Kaufman et al., 1996; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). In the sedimentary successions of the Olenek Uplift in northeastern Siberia, Protohertzina first occurs in the upper Syhargalakh Formation (lower Kessyusa Group), 15\u201320 m above a negative shift in \u03b413C values (Knoll et al., 1995; Pelechaty et al., 1996) that may represent the BACE (see Kouchinsky et al., 2017 for discussion). The first occurrence of Protohertzina in this region coincides with the first occurrence of T. pedum and the base of the Cambrian has been placed at this level as a result (Rogov et al., 2015; Nagovitsin et al., 2015; Kouchinsky et al., 2017).\nIn South China, at the Xiaotan and Laolin sections of Yunnan, the FO of Protohertzina has been reported approximately 80 m and 40 m respectively above the nadir of the BACE (Fig. 20; Luo et al., 1991; Li and Xiao, 2004; Li et al., 2009, 2013; Yang et al., 2014a). In Hubei, Protohertzina has been documented from unit 2 of the Yanjiahe Formation (Chen, 1984; Guo et al., 2014) approximately 5\u20136 m above the nadir of the BACE (Steiner et al., 2020). In the Mackenzie Mountains of northwestern Canada, Protohertzina first occurs towards the top of the Ingta Formation (Conway and Fritz, 1980; Narbonne and Aitken, 1995) approximately 150m above the nadir of the BACE that occurs in the basal\u2013mid beds of the Ingta Formation (Narbonne et al., 1994). In southwestern Mongolia the first occurrence of Protohertzina is 10.46 m above the nadir of the BACE in the uppermost Zuun-Arts Formation, documented herein (Figs. 5, 18).\n\nProtohertzina has also been documented in close association with the BACE in the Kazakh terrane and Iran, however the relationship is less clear in these regions, as biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data were collected at different times and from different localities (Missarzhevsky and Mambetov, 1981; Yang et al., 2016; Stammeier et al., 2019). The lack of illustrated fossil specimens and questionable taxonomy has also hindered precise correlation of these sections. In the Kazakh terrane the first occurrence of Protohertzina may be in the uppermost Kyrshabakty Formation (initially reported by Missarzhevsky and Mambetov, 1981, but not confirmed by later workers) or the lowermost Chulaktau Formation (Yang et al., 2016). These occurrences roughly coincide with the nadir of the BACE that is interpreted to occur close to the boundary between these two formations (Stammeier et al., 2019).\nIn Iran, the first undisputed specimens of P. anabarica occur in the Middle Dolomite Member of the Soltanieh Formation, just above the first occurrence of T. pedum in the uppermost Lower Shale Member (Hamdi et al., 1989; Shahkarami et al., 2017; Devaere et al., 2021). Hamdi et al. (1989) however, reported questionable fragments of Protohertzina sp. in the uppermost Lower Dolomite Member of the Soltanieh Formation together with Hyolithellus sp., Rugatotheca sp., and morphs of Olivooides. None of these taxa were illustrated and their occurrence in the Lower Dolomite Member, although accepted, appears not to have been confirmed by later workers (Shahkarami et al., 2017; Devaere et al., 2021). The nadir of the BACE in the Valiabad Section in North Iran is interpreted to occur close to the contact of the Lower Dolomite and Shale members (Kimura et al., 1997). However, pinpointing the exact nadir is difficult due to inadequate sampling (presumably due to the dominance of shale in particular intervals) and the presence of severe fluctuations of \u03b413C values (-15\u2030) in the Lower Shale Member (Fig. 18).\nAssociation with the BACE across palaeocontinents supports a near-synchronous distribution of Protohertzina on a global scale. Importantly, in successions where reliable \u03b413C data is available, the FO of Protohertzina is always above the nadir of the BACE (closest association of ~5 m in China [Steiner et al., 2020]), with no convincing reports from older strata. The documentation of Protohertzina specimens from the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation in the Kyra-Ytyga River, eastern Siberia (Zhu et al., 2017) from horizons that were interpreted as Ediacaran are likely to be erroneous. The Ediacaran age of these strata was based predominantly on a \u03b413C profile that displayed a slight decline of \u03b413C values (from 1.43% to \u20130.65%) towards the top of the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation. Zhu et al. (2017) interpreted this chemostratigraphic curve as representing the onset of the BACE and hence the base of the Cambrian (Zhu et al., 2017, 2019; Zhuravlev and Wood, 2018; Wood et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, Bowyer et al. (2022) suggest that the Anabarites trisulcatus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Protohertzina anabarica Zone and the lower boundary of the Nemakit-Daldynian is Ediacaran in age (pre-BACE). This conclusion was based on the presence of Cambrotubulus decurvatus (not Anabarites trisulcatus) in the Turkut Formation (Rogov et al., 2015) and the 542.8+1.3 Ma radiometric age (Bowring et al., 1993) of a volcanic breccia within the unconformably overlying Syhargalakh Formation (Rogov et al., 2015). A consequence of the interpretation of Bowyer et al. (2022) is that the first global appearances of not only anabaritids, but also a menagerie of \u2018typical\u2019 Cambrian representatives (e.g. Protohertzina, Halkieria sp. and Fomitchella spp. [Zhu et al., 2017]) are dramatically lowered to the upper Ediacaran.\nCorrelations of Bowyer et al. (2022) remain unsubstantiated, as the nadir of the BACE is not preserved in the Kyra-Ytyga section and \u03b413C profiles through the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation at other Siberian localities display a markedly different signal (Braiser et al., 1993). For example, a \u03b413C profile through the lower-middle Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation at the Aldan River (Magaritz et al., 1986; Braiser et al., 1993, 1994; Kouchinsky et al., 2007; Varlamov et al., 2008) shows a rising trend through the entire Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation from negative values of ca. -4.5\u2030 (excursion \u2018N\u2019 in Kouchinsky et al., 2017), reaching peak values of ca. 3.5\u2030 (excursion \u2018I\u2019) in the upper Ust'-Yudoma Formation (Fig. 19\n). The negative \u2018N\u2019 excursion in the lower Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation (Magaritz et al., 1986; Braiser et al., 1993, 1994; Kouchinsky et al., 2007; Varlamov et al., 2008) has previously been correlated with the BACE (Fig. 19) suggesting that the E\u2013C boundary occurs at a much lower stratigraphic level in the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation than presented by\u00a0Zhu et al. (2017). In contrast, the BACE likely occurs approximately 185 m below the base of the Pestrotsvet Formation in the Dvortsy section (Braiser et al., 1993; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). Although Siberia hosts one of the most important E\u2013C successions in the world, the majority of the stratigraphic sections discussed herein have not been recently investigated and likely require detailed reassement (e.g. data presented in Zhu et al. [2017]\u00a0was based on unpublished material collected in 1981). Additionally, it is possible that the radiometric date from the volcanic breccia within the lower Syhargalakh Formation cited by Bowyer et al. (2022) as evidence for an Ediacaran age may be refined by future high precision CA-ID-TIMS analyses (Kouchinsky et al., 2007; Bowyer et al., 2022).\n\n\n6.2.6\n\nProblems with Protohertzina\nAlthough Cambrian body fossils of chaetognaths (the organism that Protohertzina most likely represents) have been recovered from shale and mudstones (e.g., Burgess Shale and Chengjiang Lagerst\u00e4tten; Shu et al., 2017; Caron and Cheung, 2019), cherts (Braiser and Singh, 1987; Yang et al., 2014b) and specimens questionably assigned to Protohertzina have been found in siliciclastic deposits (McIlroy and Szaniawski, 2000), the taxon is most frequently recovered from carbonate deposits via acid dissolution. This dependence on carbonate facies places limitations on its utility as a tool for global correlation. Restricted environmental tolerance explains its delayed appearance in E\u2013C successions that are predominantly siliciclastic. For example, in Newfoundland, the FO of P. anabarica is within the upper Member 4 of the Chapel Island Formation (Landing et al., 1989), hundreds of metres above the FO of T. pedum. In South Australia, Protohertzina does not appear until the Micrina etheridgei Zone (Terreneuvian Stage 2, Betts et al., 2017b, 2018). Nevertheless, the prevalence of Protohertzina in carbonate facies provides the opportunity to couple its biostratigraphic signal with \u03b413C chemostratigraphy and employ a multi-proxy approach to dating and correlation not possible in siliciclastic strata.\n\n\n\n6.3\nChemostratigraphy: A case for the BACE\n\n6.3.1\nThe advantages of \u03b413C chemostratigraphy\nAs doubts over the utility of trace and skeletal fossils endure, carbon isotope chemostratigraphy has rapidly become the tool of choice for high-resolution correlation in the Cambrian (Braiser et al., 1993, 1994, 1996b; Maloof et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2005; Ishikawa et al., 2008, 2014; Smith et al., 2016a; Chang et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2017; Schmid, 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). Carbonate rock successions record variations in the 13C\/12C ratio of ancient ocean waters over time. The world\u2019s oceans are mixed on relatively short timescales, hence inorganic \u03b413C peaks and nadirs can provide a method for correlating contemporaneous carbonate strata globally. Carbon isotopes are also relatively resistant to major diagenetic processes (Saltzman et al., 2012) and in sufficiently continuous rock successions the resulting isotopic signature tends to remain recognizable despite any potential local diagenetic overprinting (Weissert et al., 2008; Kouchinsky et al., 2017).\nNegative \u03b413C values in the vicinity of the E\u2013C boundary were recognised when chemostratigraphic methods were becoming increasingly applied in the 1980s (Hs\u00fc et al., 1985; Tucker, 1986; Magaritz et al., 1986). Since this time the BACE has been recognized at the E\u2013C boundary worldwide. It is now known from the Siberian platform (Kirschvink et al., 1991; Brasier et al., 1994, 1993; Knoll et al., 1995; Kaufman and Knoll, 1995; Kaufman et al., 1996; Bartley et al., 1998; Kouchinsky et al., 2007, 2017), northwest Canada (Narbonne et al., 1994), Morocco (Maloof et al., 2005), Iran (Kimura et al., 1997), Kazakhstan (Stammeier et al., 2019), South China (Ishikawa et al., 2008, 2014; Li et al., 2009, 2013; Steiner et al., 2020), the Great Basin (Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003; Corsetti and Kaufman, 2003; Smith et al., 2016b), Mexico (Loyd et al., 2012, 2013; Hodgin et al., 2021) and Mongolia (Brasier et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2016a; herein). A radiometrically dated negative excursion (541+0.13 Ma [Amthor et al., 2003; Bowring et al., 2007]) in the A4 Member of the Ara Group, Oman, had been selected to determine the age of the E\u2013C boundary (Peng et al., 2012). However, discrepancies with other radiometrically dated excursions (Hodgin et al., 2021) and dearth of biostratigraphic data for the Oman sections have cast doubts over whether this excursion represents the BACE (Peng et al., 2020;\u00a0Bowyer et al., 2022).\n.\n\n\n6.3.2\nCriticisms of \u03b413C chemostratigraphy\nDespite the increasing reliance on chemostratigraphy for correlation of lower Cambrian rocks worldwide, the reliability and accuracy of carbon isotope chemostratigraphy has been questioned. Main criticisms of the technique are 1) that carbon isotopes can be altered by diagenetic processes (Higgins et al., 2018; Ahm et al., 2018; Bold et al., 2020; Nelson et al., 2021) and 2) that \u03b413C values in carbonate rocks reflect local environmental conditions rather than global values (Holmden et al., 1998; Swart and Eberli, 2005; Swart, 2008; Swart and Kennedy, 2012; Geyman and Maloof, 2019, 2021). Recent work on modern carbonate platforms has shown that \u03b413C values from carbonate marine sediments can vary significantly across shelf-to-slope transects, indicating that local platform processes can decouple the \u03b413C of shallow carbonates from global ocean chemistry (Swart et al., 2009; Geyman and Maloof, 2019, 2021). Absolute \u03b413C values can also be affected during burial and subsequent interaction with circulating fluids and it has been shown that dolomitzation can have a profound effect on the carbon isotopic records of carbonates (Higgins et al., 2018; Nelson et al., 2021; Bold et al., 2020). Exploring the extent to which local platform conditions and diagenesis alter the \u03b413C of bulk limestone from the primary global seawater signal is the focus of much research, and frameworks to interpret carbon isotope excursions in the geological record are being continually developed (Holmden et al., 1998; Swart and Eberli, 2005; Swart, 2008; Swart and Kennedy, 2012; Higgins et al., 2018; Geyman and Maloof, 2019, 2021; Bold et al., 2020). Oxygen isotope chemostratigraphy (\u03b418O) has been frequently used in concert with carbon isotopes to detect alteration (Marshall, 1992; Melim et al., 2001; Higgins et al., 2018). More recently, Ca and Mg isotopes in addition to trace- element ratios (such as Sr\/Ca and Mg\/Ca) have been employed to identify both primary mineralogy and diagenetic alteration (Higgins et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2020; Bold et al., 2020). Despite these advancements, the issue of overprinting and the role that local conditions and diagenesis plays in shifting the primary global seawater signal is often difficult to fully constrain.\nThese concerns have been highlighted in Cambrian strata with anomalous variation in chemostratigraphic trends that may have been altered by local aquafacies and\/or experienced reworking or reoxidation of light organic carbon sources (Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021). For example, the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation on the Siberian Platform exhibits a rising trend from negative values (-4.5\u2030; considered the BACE) to a positive excursion of 3.5\u2030 in its upper part (Fig. 19) (Magaritz et al., 1986; Braiser et al., 1993, 1994; Kouchinsky et al., 2007; Varlamov et al., 2008). However, in the nearby Kyra-Ytyga River section (Zhu et al., 2017), the BACE is not preserved and the Ust\u2019-Yudoma Formation instead shows a plateau of positive \u03b413C values that led Zhu et al. (2017) to interpret the strata as Ediacaran. In Namibia, \u03b413C values of carbonates plateau at ~1\u2030 throughout the Spitskopf Member (Fig. 16; Linnemann et al., 2019), despite dates from ash beds overlapping with dates of tuffaceous material in the La Ci\u00e9nga Formation in Mexico where \u03b413C values at the nadir of the excursion reach -7.5\u2030 (Fig. 17; Hodgin et al., 2021). Hodgin et al. (2021) suggested that the potential presence of local, isotopically distinct pools of dissolved inorganic carbon could explain the absence of the BACE in Namibia, however Bowyer et al. (2022) has argued that the positive \u03b413C profile of the Swartpunt section does not directly correlate with the BACE.\nBeyond grappling with potential alteration in the primary \u03b413C signal, correlation of chemostratigraphic profiles relies on being able to accurately align positive and negative excursions. Peaks and nadirs may be indistinct, and identification may be impossible in sequences where excursions are omitted due to tectonic truncations, hiatuses or the reworking of strata (Kouchinsky et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 2020). Such difficulties may be minimized by combining carbon isotope stratigraphy with biostratigraphic tools that would place a carbon isotope excursion within a specific biozone or in association with the FAD of a particular taxon. Although this has been strongly advocated (see Betts et al., 2018; Steiner et al., 2020) it is still not standard practice and chemostratigraphy continues to be utilized as a stand-alone proxy for regional and global correlation (Maloof et al., 2010a, 2010b; Smith et al., 2016a). In the absence of robust supporting data, miscorrelations between carbon isotope trends has created controversial age assessments (e.g., Brasier et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2016a, 2017; Landing and Kruse, 2017; Bowyer et al., 2022) and resulted in temporal scattering of the FADs of key Cambrian skeletal taxa (see Steiner et al., 2020 for discussion)\nThere have been recent attempts to devise quantitative methods to identify Cambrian isotope peaks (Hay et al., 2019; Sinnesael et al., 2021). Such models tend to require a priori assumptions regarding stratigraphic positions of particular curves in (what are assumed to be) complete successions, and must reliably account for numerous variables such as sedimentation rates and diagenetic effects on isotopes and fossil taxa. Hence, the applicability of such methods is yet to be demonstrated, and the standard approach relies on qualitative assessments. Consequently, the reliability and accuracy of chemostratigraphic correlation relies heavily on coupling with other robust proxies, such as biostratigraphy and\/or absolute radiometric dates.\n\n\n6.3.3\nCorrelating a chemostratigraphic curve\nDespite these challenges, it is clear that global \u03b413C trends are widely and repeatedly detected, and in carbonate rocks straddling the E\u2013C boundary values indicating the BACE regularly occur. However, while chemostratigraphic excursions are widely used for correlation, the point on the curve at which to place the boundary is often unclear. Some use the peak or nadir (Peng et al., 2012; Narbonne et al., 2012; Cai et al., 2019), and others use the \u2018turning point\u2019 of the excursion where values begin to increase or decrease (Zhu et al., 2017, 2019). Turning points in chemostratigraphic curves are difficult to recognise, and so the peak or the nadir of an excursion is the most logical position to place a temporal marker. The misinterpretation of the \u03b413C profile by Zhu et al. (2017) in the Ust\u2019- Yudoma Formation highlights the difficulties of utilizing the onset of the excursion as a marker. In this case, there is uncertainty surrounding whether decreasing \u03b413C values indicate commencement of the BACE or simply represent minor isotopic fluctuations, or a change in signal influenced by local or regional factors.\nCurrently there is no standard method for defining an isotope excursion (Smith et al., 2015). However, utilizing the most distinctive feature of the \u03b413C excursion\u2014namely the peak or nadir\u2014is likely to be the most straightforward way to define and correlate it. In the BACE, and other negative excursions the nadir would be defined as the horizon that yielded the lowest \u03b413C values in an excursion profile. If consecutive samples yielded the exact same \u03b413C value then the oldest sample in the succession would represent the nadir of the excursion.\n\n\n\n\n7\nGlobal E\u2013C boundary: state of play\n\n7.1\nRecognizing the E-C boundary\nLess than ten years ago, Landing et al., 2013, p. 145) declared that \u201cthe existing basal Cambrian GSSP can be readily sustained\u201d and that \u201cthere were no strong reasons to revisit what had been an almost 30 year-long debate\u201d. However, despite this resolute attitude global correlation of the E\u2013C boundary continues to be frustrated by the inadequacies of T. pedum (or the base of the T. pedum Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone) as a proxy for the base of the Cambrian.\nA GSSP is intended to be a stable, precise horizon for global correlation. Despite this, the base of the Cambrian in numerous sections cannot be correlated using T. pedum, even if it is present. In the BAY4\/5 section in Bayan Gol for example, T. pedum occurs 250 m above the base of the Bayan Gol Formation (Goldring and Jensen, 1996). However, the E\u2013C boundary has never been positioned here, as this is clearly a considerable distance above the most likely stratigraphic location of the E\u2013C boundary (Brasier et al., 1996a, 1996b; Goldring and Jensen, 1996; Smith et al., 2016a; Yang et al., 2020; Steiner et al., 2020; herein). Biostratigraphic (FO of P. anabarica) and chemostratigraphic evidence indicates that the base of the Cambrian (corresponding with the nadir of the BACE) should be placed in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation, just below (10.46 m below, in our study) the contact with the overlying Bayangol Formation (Smith et al., 2016a; Adachi et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020; Steiner et al., 2020; herein). However, this boundary must be considered informal, as neither the first occurrence of Protohertzina nor the presence of the BACE provides any direct association with the GSSP on Fortune Head.\nBayan Gol is not the only section where T. pedum is of little to no use when defining the E\u2013C boundary. Successions across the Siberian Platform (Kouchinsky et al., 2017), South China (Li et al., 2009, 2013; Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021), Kazakhstan (Yang et al., 2016; Stammeier et al., 2019), Iran (Shahkarami et al., 2017), Morocco (Maloof et al., 2010a, 2010b) and Oman (Amthor et al., 2003) have all relied on alternative markers to define the E\u2013C boundary. Even in Laurentian sections where T. pedum is present, the focus has shifted to utilise the BACE, rather than the first occurrence of the ichnotaxon to determine the base of the Cambrian (Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000, 2003; Loyd et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2016b; Hodgin et al., 2021; Fig. 17\n).\n\n\n\n\nDespite increased discussion over the last few years concerning how to best approach this dilemma (Peng and Babcock, 2012; Landing et al., 2013; Babcock et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021) very little progress has been made. Reluctance to implement any formal changes may be related to uncertainties and potential limitations concerning alternative marker options. Regardless, it is clear that there are currently two other potential marker options that can assist with the definition of the base of the Cambrian globally; 1) the FAD of the skeletal taxon Protohertzina and 2) the BACE.\n\n\n7.2\n\nThe FAD of Protohertzina\nThe rapid diversification of biomineralizing organisms is a hallmark of the Cambrian radiation and the FAD of a skeletal taxon has long been discussed as a viable option for defining the base of the Cambrian (Cowie, 1981). However, the recent discovery of mixed Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian faunas appears to have influenced many to move away from skeletal taxa as a correlation method (Landing et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2019). This \u2018mixing\u2019 though is restricted to only a handful of tubular taxa (e.g., cloudiniids, Anabarites and Cambrotubulus), and the suggestion that this faunal overlap indicates an evolutionary continuum between Ediacaran and Cambrian faunas is premature (Zhu et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2019; Bowyer et al., 2022). Many skeletal fossils considered typically Cambrian (based on our current boundary definition) remain exclusively so, such as Protohertzina anabarica. Occurrence of tubular organisms (e.g., Cloudina) in the uppermost Ediacaran (Grant, 1990), is well known, and the presence of \u2018similar\u2019 tubular taxa over the E\u2013C boundary does not diminish the capacity for specific skeletal taxa to define the base of the Cambrian.\nDespite the demonstrable correlation potential of Cambrian skeletal taxa, Landing et al. (2013) warned against using the FAD of any fossil to define a global chronostratigraphic unit, due to the diachronous nature of fossil FADs. It is true that speciation is not instantaneous, and there are time lags between appearances of a particular species as it disperses around the globe. Estimates of the global FAD based on local or regional ranges of taxa will tend to underestimate global ranges (Cody et al., 2008; Landing et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015) and the true stratigraphic distribution of a specific taxon will most likely never be known (Sadler, 2004; Landing et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015; Lucas, 2018, 2019). In an ideal scenario for the definition of a stage boundary, the FO and the FAD of a taxon will align perfectly, however this is extremely unlikely. In an effort to overcome such problems, Landing et al. (2013) suggested that, rather than the FAD of T. pedum, the GSSP horizon should coincide with the base of the T. pedum Ichnozone Assemblage. The stratigraphic position of the T.\u00a0pedum\u00a0Ichnofossil Assemblage Zone is ambiguously defined as \u201cimmediately above the last occurrences of H. podolica and P. delicatus\u201d (Landing et al., 2013 p. 145). Regardless, this merely sidesteps the problem as last appearance data (LADs) of fossil taxa share many of the same diachronous concerns as FADs (Sadler, 2004; Cody et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2015).\nStratigraphic concerns over fossil FADs and LADs can be minimized by incorporating stratigraphic records from multiple locations around the world. Subsequent marriage with alternative correlation techniques such as chemostratigraphy or radiometric dates will produce the best estimates of a global FAD (or LAD) for a particular taxon. Protohertzina for example, has been reported from early Cambrian carbonate successions all over the world and its stratigraphic distribution is well documented (e.g., Steiner et al., 2007; Kouchinsky et al., 2012, 2017). These occurrences are frequently supported by chemostratigraphic data showing that the FO of Protohertzina is regularly in close association with the prominent negative excursion known as the BACE, and is always above the nadir of this excursion (Fig. 21). This association of the BACE and the first occurrence of Protohertzina across palaeocontinents provides strong evidence to support a near-synchronous distribution (and hence a global FAD) and highlights the taxon\u2019s potential for defining the base of the Cambrian.\n\n\n7.3\nThe nadir of the BACE\n\u03b413C profiles are important chronostratigraphic tools and excursions have been used to refine stratigraphy in the Ordovician (Kaljo et al., 2003), Silurian (Cramer et al., 2010; Cramer et al., 2011) and even the Cambrian, where the DICE \u03b413C excursion is a secondary marker of the Drumian GSSP (Babcock et al., 2007). The BACE is recorded in the majority of E\u2013C carbonate successions where similar \u03b413C trends are repeatedly detected. However, despite a concerted push for the BACE to contribute to the definition of the base of the Cambrian (see Zhu et al., 2006, 2017, 2019) reluctance remains, primarily due to apprehensions regarding the accuracy and reliability of the \u03b413C signal (see Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021). Uncertainites affecting the interpretation of \u03b413C chemostratigraphic signals can however be minimized by quantifying local depositional conditions and diagenesis. Identification and correlation of \u03b413C excursions also relies on supplementary biostratigraphic or radiometric markers. The early Cambrian is characterized by several major rapid changes in isotopic ratios, with four negative and five positive excursions in the Fortunian alone (Landing et al., 2013; Landing and Kouchinsky, 2016; Kouchinsky et al., 2017). \u03b413C perturbations can be easily confused when not coupled with another proxy (see anomaly \u2018W\u2019 and the BACE; Brasier et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2016a; Bowyer et al., 2022; herein). Integration of multi-proxy datasets is the most reliable method for interpreting \u03b413C curves. However, while this integrative approach is increasingly utilized, it is yet to become routine.\nMore commonly, biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic data are decoupled; collected from several sections at various localities, and often published at different times (e.g., Brasier et al., 1993; Narbonne et al., 1994; Knoll et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2016a). For example, the \u03b413C profile produced by Narbonne et al. (1994) for E\u2013C strata in northwestern Canada was pieced together using data from six localities, and fossil horizons (skeletal and trace fossils) were estimated using previous publications by others (e.g., Conway Morris and Fritz, 1980; MacNaughton and Narbonne, 1992). Similarly, knowledge of the E\u2013C boundary of the Kazakh terranes is pieced together from three disparate localities (Yang et al., 2016; Stammeier et al., 2019; Fig. 18). And until the recent work by Steiner et al. (2020) in Hubei, South China, E\u2013C biostratigraphic data from this area were most commonly collected from outcrop (Guo et al., 2014; Topper et al., 2019), while chemostratigraphic data were obtained from drill core (Ishikawa et al., 2008).\nConstruction of composite columns is commonly achieved by lithostratigraphic correlation. However, precise characters and thicknesses of lithostratigraphic units will vary across a basin, confounding correlation of a fossil bearing horizon in one section with a chemostratigraphic excursion in another. Therefore, \u2018stitching\u2019 together bio- and chemostratigraphic data from different localities is clearly not best practice, as this obscures the stratigraphic relationship between fossil occurrences and perturbations in the \u03b413C profile. In the Zavkhan Basin for example, incorporation of disparate sections into composite columns, and integration of recent and outdated bio- and chemostratigraphic data has resulted in considerable chronostratigraphic uncertainty (Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Brasier et al., 1996b; Maloof et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2016a). Hence, it is clear that fully integrated, multi-proxy chronostratigraphic methods using data derived (preferably simulatenously) from single, continuous sections delivers the most robust and reliable results.\n\n\n\n8\nGlobal E\u2013C boundary: the future\n\nBabcock et al. (2014) presented five options for potentially managing the definition of the base of the Cambrian. They include 1) No change in definition, 2) Designate an Auxiliary Stratotype Section and Point (ASSP) to correlate from, 3) Use the best estimate of the FAD of T. pedum, 4) Change the GSSP definition, horizon and evolutionary marker event and, 5) Use a non-biostratigraphic tool to coincide with a redefined GSSP horizon. It is clear that the Cambrian GSSP as currently defined is insufficient for accurate global correlation. Hence, option 1 of Babcock et al. (2014) may be eliminated. Option 3 may be practical if the GSSP is redefined at the FAD of T. pedum in another locality, however the exclusive use of T. pedum has been shown to be ultimately imprecise and unreliable. Therefore, either designating an ASSP to enhance correlation of the Fortune Head section or redefining the GSSP entirely (either using a biostratigraphic or non-biostatigraphic marker) represents the most viable options for resolving global correlation of the E\u2013C boundary.\n\n8.1\nDesignating an ASSP\nASSPs represent boundaries that complement the GSSP by using additional stratigraphic markers in a different paleogeographic region to where the GSSP has been defined (Ergaliev et al., 2014). While uncommon, ASSPs have been suggested or designated for a handful of lower Palaeozoic boundaries to promote correlation. For example, ASSPs have been suggested to assist with correlating the base of the Ordovician (Miller, 2016; Wang et al., 2021) and an ASSP was established in Kazakhstan for the base of the Cambrian Jiangshanian Stage (Ergaliev et al., 2014). A pathway forward for the base of the Cambrian may be to designate an ASSP at a locality where both T. pedum and an additional marker (such as the BACE) occurs. Stratigraphic sections in Laurentia (e.g., Boundary Canyon and Mount Dunfee sections in California and Nevada and the Cerro Raj\u00f3n section in Mexico; Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000; Smith et al., 2016b; Hodgin et al., 2021) preserve both markers and a radioisotopic age (the Cerro Raj\u00f3n section) and therefore have potential for defining an ASSP. Several disadvantages of the current GSSP could be improved by the designation of an ASSP and the incorporation of a secondary marker such as the BACE. However currently, the establishment of a Cambrian ASSP is undermined by the total lack of additional secondary markers at Fortune Head. As the stratigraphic relationship between T. pedum and secondary markers is unknown in the GSSP section, reliable correlation between the current GSSP and a potential ASSP would not be possible.\n\n\n8.2\nRedefining the GSSP\nComplications involved with establishing an ASSP highlights the need to reevaluate the definition, horizon and marker of the current Cambrian GSSP. Fears that redefining the GSSP would involve the \u2018destabilization of the definition of the Cambrian System\u2019 (Babcock et al., 2014, p. 9) have discouraged progress. However, it is clear that the base of the Cambrian is already unsettled, and long-term term consistency should be favoured over short-term destabilization. Reassessment of the Cambrian GSSP is not without precedent. In 2008 the GSSP for the base of the Silurian system was redefined following confusion over the biostratigraphic definition of the boundary (Rong et al., 2008). This has ensured a greater understanding of the boundary interval and improved the resolution with which it can be globally correlated. Skeletal fossil biostratigraphy (Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021), carbon isotope chemostratigraphy (Zhu et al., 2017, 2019) and ichnofossil occurrences (Landing et al., 2013; Buatois, 2018) are all possible alternative methods to define the base of the Cambrian. However, all are affected to some degree by preservational biases or diagenetic overprinting. Hence the capacity of each marker to independently define a global boundary is doubtful.\nThe primary purpose of a GSSP is to promote correlation over a large area and reliance on a single marker for robust correlation is unacceptable. Secondary proxies are essential for permitting correlation with localities where the primary signal is absent (Finney, 2013; Babcock et al., 2014; Lucas, 2018, 2019). This multi-proxy chronostratigraphic approach is now a requirement of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) for the definition of chronostratigraphic units (Cowie et al., 1986; Remane et al., 1986; Babcock et al., 2014). Yet, despite this emphasis on adopting a multi-proxy approach, the notion that a single marker may be sufficient for defining the E\u2013C boundary persists. For example, Zhu et al. (2019, p. 36) state that \u201cthe base of the Cambrian can be redefined as the onset of decreasing \u03b413C values from the terminal Ediacaran positive carbon isotope plateau to the BACE excursion\u201d and do not suggest secondary markers.\nFaunal assemblages across the E\u2013C boundary comprise only a handful of skeletal fossils, acritarchs and ichnotaxa, offering much less diversity than at younger boundaries. The Albian Stage of the Cretaceous for example has 28 secondary markers including calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera, ammonites and a bivalve (Kennedy et al., 2017). Diverse secondary taxa provide ample opportunities to correlate, and mitigate the effects of strong facies dependence of a single marker. However, this approach may only be applied in the Cambrian if the boundary is moved significantly higher in the geological timescale (to the base of Stage 3 at the incoming of trilobites for example). Currently, only three proxies have strong potential for globally correlating basal Cambrian strata; the FAD of T. pedum, the FAD of P. anabarica and the BACE. While it is clear that the GSSP horizon at Fortune Head does not represent the best option to define the base of the Cambrian globally, dismissing T. pedum as a stratigraphic marker entirely (Zhu et al., 2017, 2019; Steiner et al., 2020; Yang and Steiner, 2021) further reduces opportunities for correlation, and limits definition of the boundary to even fewer markers, decreasing capacity for reliable global correlation.\nIn the few regions where all three markers have been unambiguously documented, they occur in relatively close association, with the FO of T. pedum and P. anabarica both occurring stratigraphically above the nadir of the BACE (Figs. 17-21). In the Mackenzie Mountains in Canada, the FO of T. pedum and P. anabarica and the nadir of the BACE all occur within the Ingta Formation (Narbonne et al., 1994; Figs. 17, 21). In South China, the nadir of the BACE is in the Daibu Member and the FO of T. pedum and P. anabarica occur in the overlying Zhongyicun Member (Li et al., 2009, 2013; Figs 20,21). Unfortunately, in these regions all three markers are yet to be documented from the same stratigraphic section. There are however, several locations around the globe where two out of the three markers have been documented from the same section.\nThe stratigraphic relationship between the BACE and the FAD of T. pedum and the FAD of P. anabarica are consistent globally, and represent perhaps the most promising way to redefine the base of the Cambrian. Treptichnus pedum and the BACE have been documented from a number of sections in Laurentia (Fig. 21), including the Boundary Canyon section in Death Valley (Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000), the Cerro Raj\u00f3n section in Mexico (although the markers are separated by an unconformable surface; Hodgin et al., 2021) and at Mt Dunfee in Esmeralda County (most likely section E1421 of Smith et al., 2016a). Protohertzina anabarica and the BACE have been reported from the Laolin (Li et al., 2009), Xiaotan (Li et al., 2013) and Gunziao (Steiner et al., 2020) sections in South China, the Kotuj River\/Kotujakan section 2 (Kaufman et al., 1996; Kouchinsky et al., 2017) in Siberia and the Bayan Gol section in Mongolia documented herein.\nIn the absence of a single stratigraphic section that yields all three markers we propose that a new GSSP and corresponding ASSP be erected; one section that captures the FO of T. pedum and the BACE, and another that captures the FO of P. anabarica and the BACE. The nadir of the BACE would correlate the two stratotype sections. \u03b413C chemostratigraphy represents the best solution to enhance correlation across facies and palaeocontinents. However, because identification of the BACE requires support from biostratigraphic data, both P. anabarica and T. pedum would serve as essential secondary markers. In this scenario, in siliciclastic successions where a \u03b413C profile is unavailable, the FAD of T. pedum may be implemented. In carbonate successions, either the BACE or the FAD of P. anabarica may be employed as the boundary marker. Erection of both a new GSSP and an ASSP gleans as much utility as possible from the few chronostratigraphic markers that are available in the early Cambrian.\nWe suggest that the GSSP horizon be defined in a predominantly carbonate succession, as this would provide the most complete \u03b413C profile. Because samples for isotopes and skeletal fossils can be collected simultaneously, a carbonate section also provides the opportunity to record the FAD of the secondary marker P. anabarica. Other skeletal fossils (such as cloudiniids or Anabarites) commonly found at these stratigraphic levels would provide additional biostratigraphic data to bracket the BACE. Should the Cambrian GSSP be redefined, the Bayan Gol section in Mongolia (documented herein) represents a strong candidate, as do sections in South China (Xiaotan; Fig. 20) and Siberia (the Kotuj River\/Kotujakan section 2; Fig. 19). Laurentian sections from the Great Basin that preserve the FAD of T. pedum in close association with the BACE (Fig. 17) are likely candidates for a Cambrian ASSP.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusion\nThe application of T. pedum has demonstrated that a single proxy is insufficient to define the base of the Cambrian. Lack of alternative markers (e.g., skeletal fossils, chemostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic or radiometric data) at the GSSP locality at Fortune Head isolates this section from global correlation, and has prompted the search for different ways to define the boundary (Babcock et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019). There is now a general consensus that the integration of multiple proxies (such as biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy) should be employed for global correlation and boundary definition (Betts et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019; Steiner et al., 2020). For the base of the Cambrian, three potential markers may be used; the FAD of T. pedum, the FAD of P. anabarica and the nadir of the BACE. The nadir of the BACE represents the most promising way to redefine the base of the Cambrian, but employing these three proxies in conjunction strengthens their application towards global correlation of the E\u2013C boundary.\nBayan Gol in western Mongolia represents a unique opportunity to document shelly fossils, isotopes and trace fossils through a continuous, predominantly carbonate succession that captures the E\u2013C transition. Although this section has been studied extensively in the past (Voronin et al., 1982; Brasier et al., 1996a; Khomentovsky and Gibsher, 1996; Esakova and Zhegallo, 1996; Smith et al., 2016a), the practice of developing composite sections and decoupling fossil and isotope data has obscured the stratigraphic significance of this sedimentary package. Shelly fossil biostratigraphy with tightly integrated \u03b413C data demonstrates the close temporal relationship between the FAD of Protohertzina and the nadir of the BACE in the upper Zuun-Arts Formation at Bayan Gol. This stratigraphic relationship is consistent globally, making the section at Bayan Gol an ideal candidate for a redefined Cambrian GSSP. Redefining the GSSP and defining a corresponding ASSP by exploiting the stratigraphic relationships between the BACE and other accessory markers is the most robust method of globally correlating the E\u2013C boundary.\nGSSPs are often regarded as immutable points (Ager, 1963; Cowie et al., 1986; Vai, 2001), that once ratified should \u201cremain fixed in spite of discoveries stratigraphically above and\/or below\u201d (Cowie, 1986, p. 79). However, new discoveries and advances in methods and techniques will undoubtedly fine-tune these boundaries. Biostratigraphic definitions have historically dominated stage boundaries through the Phanerozoic (Smith et al., 2015), but \u03b413C trends are increasingly utilized for global correlation. Steadfast refusal to incorporate new data that improves chronostratigraphic boundaries prevents robust global correlation of the Cambrian and undermines scientific progress. The Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian boundary is one of the most significant boundaries in the geological timescale. The boundary separates the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic eons, marking major revolutions in the Earth\u2019s geosphere and biosphere. Ability to reliably identify and correlate this boundary globally is fundamental for charting evolutionary dynamics across this transition. Utilizing all available markers to redefine the GSSP and define a corresponding ASSP represents a pathway toward global correlation of the base of the Cambrian, and an essential improvement on the GSSP at Fortune Head.\n\n","116":"","117":"","118":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nResearch on natural sediments has been conducted for decades (Wadell, 1933; Shields, 1936; Rouse, 1937) and can provide indispensable insights to guide our understanding of microplastics. Theoretical foundations and knowledge on natural sediments have guided research on the fate and transport of microplastics in the aquatic environment (Allen, 1985; Nizzetto et al., 2016; Horton and Dixon, 2017; Kooi et al., 2018), but most early studies in the field of ecotoxicology ignored direct comparisons between microplastics and natural sediments as they struggled to fully address the physical nature of the particles. Only recently, studies have started to compare the physical interaction of microplastics and sediments with organisms, focussing on e.g. the number of particles, surface area and particle shape (Sch\u00fcr et al., 2020; Scherer et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2020). Moreover, microplastics research still has difficulties with fundamental tasks such as the description of particle properties (Rochman et al., 2019; Hartmann et al., 2019), transport (Hoellein et al., 2019; Petersen and Hubbart, 2021), or representative sampling (Cowger et al., 2021a; Liedermann et al., 2018), each of which may benefit from concepts in sedimentary research. To delineate where concepts from natural sediments are or can be used for microplastics research and where we require further explorations, we review similarities and differences between natural sediment and microplastic particles regarding their particle properties, their transport behaviour, available sampling techniques and their ecotoxicology. This allows us to highlight knowledge gaps and identify future research questions that need to be addressed to significantly advance our still limited knowledge on microplastics.\n\n\n2\nParticle properties\nWhile the description of sediment grains has a long history (Wadell, 1933; Sternberg, 1875; Wentworth, 1933; Krumbein, 1941), the most-suitable description of microplastic particle properties is still up for debate (Rochman et al., 2019; Hartmann et al., 2019; Kooi and Koelmans, 2019). This section highlights the similarities and the differences between the properties of microplastics and natural sediments regarding their size, shape and density, pointing out difficulties of microplastic particle description and indicating where knowledge from sedimentology can be useful for informing microplastics characterization.\n\n2.1\nSize\nDetermining the size of environmental particles is important to understand the fate of these particles in the field as well as correlating these data to exposure studies to gain understanding of the relative importance of size as a driver of bioavailability and toxicity for risk assessment. Natural sediments are classified based on particle size ranges defining a \u2018class\u2019 (silt, sand, gravel) and grades specifying sub-ranges of a given class (e.g. fine sand, coarse sand). A commonly used particle size classification is the Udden-Wentworth grain size chart (Wentworth, 1933). Size definitions for microplastics are still debated Hartmann et al., 2019, although the definition of particles with a diameter of less than 5\u00a0mm is often used (Arthur et al., 2008; Wagner et al., 2014; Koelmans et al., 2015), while other studies propose to use the micrometre scale (< 1\u00a0mm) to define microplastics (Browne et al., 2007; Andrady, 2015). The diameter hereby generally refers to the longest principal dimension of the particle, which is difficult to determine for microplastic particles due to their highly variable shapes (Kooi and Koelmans, 2019) and the currently used methods for size sorting, as described later on. The lower boundary for microplastics is debated even more, with values ranging from 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm up to 335\u00a0\u03bcm (Hartmann et al., 2019). However, 1\u00a0\u03bcm is often used to distinguish them from nanoplastics (Browne et al., 2007; Andrady, 2015; Gigault et al., 2018; GESAMP, 2016). If we compare the diameters of microplastics (here 0.001\u20135\u00a0mm) to the Udden-Wentworth scale, we end up with the corresponding classes of clay (< 0.004\u00a0mm), silt (0.004\u20130.063\u00a0mm), sand (0.063\u20132\u00a0mm) and gravel (2\u201363\u00a0mm).\nThe texture of natural sediments is described based on the volume or mass-based grain-size distribution (Tanner, 1995). The probability density function of the grain-size distributions can be either unimodal with one most frequently occurring grain size or polymodal showing multiple peaks in the grain-size distribution curve. The average grain-size of an unimodal distribution is described by the mode, median (d\n\n50\n), and mean of the distribution curve (Boggs, 2009). Another key parameter to describe the texture of a sediment is sediment sorting. In a poorly-sorted sediment, grains exhibit a broader size range than in a well-sorted sediment, where a significantly narrower size range is seen (Boggs, 2009). Microplastic size distributions, on the other hand, have been described using count-based power law probability density functions, where a decreasing particle number concentration relates to an increasing particle diameter (Kooi and Koelmans, 2019; C\u00f3zar et al., 2014; Kooi et al., 2021). The slopes of these size distributions have been found to vary for different aquatic environments (Kooi et al., 2021). These differences are caused by different emissions as well as site and time specific hydrodynamics and processes, and are thus difficult to generalize (Kooi et al., 2021; Besseling et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2021). However, sediment-related values such as d50 and sorting have not been used to describe microplastics yet. Size distributions for microplastics can be used to align microplastic concentration values from different studies (Koelmans et al., 2020). Further efforts to apply particle size distribution descriptors and insights derived from the granulometry of natural sediments to that of microplastics will also have to contend with the differing unit bases of these systems (i.e. volume or mass-based vs. count based, respectively).\n\n\n2.2\nShape\nAlthough the shape of an object is a fundamental physical characteristic that influences its transport, it remains very difficult to characterize (Blott and Pye, 2007) - a problem that is well-known in both sediment and microplastic research. For natural sediment, shape descriptions are mostly based on geometric standards - such as ellipsoid, oblate spheroid (length \u2260 width\u00a0=\u00a0thickness), square\/disc-shaped plates (length\u00a0=\u00a0width \u2260 thickness) and cylinder\/rod (length \u2260 width\u00a0=\u00a0thickness) (Le Roux, 2005; Chamley, 1990). While shape characterization of natural sediments has been developed mostly to answer questions regarding transport properties (Dietrich, 1982), shape definitions in microplastic research are often used to identify the origin of the particles (Rosal, 2021). Primary microplastics - which are produced in sizes smaller than 5\u00a0mm - are mostly described as pellets and beads, while secondary microplastics - which fragment and degrade from bigger plastic items in the environment - include fragments, fibres, films and foams (Burns and Boxall, 2018). Although these shape categories are generally used in microplastic research to describe the particles, the actual particle shape in the categories can vary significantly (e.g. pellets may be cylindric, lenticular, or another shape) and some categories are not even shape-describing (e.g. foam). Accordingly, the microplastic community might have to rethink their shape categories to be able to clearly distinguish between different particle shapes, to increase the comparability of different studies and to incorporate shape into quantitative representations of transport processes. Cowger et al. (2020) proposed quantifying and reporting shape metrics for every individual particle to overcome this issue, while Metz et al. (2020) proposed to use the terms fragment and spherical\/cylindrical pellet for particles with three dominant dimensions, the term foil for particle with two dominant dimensions and the term fibre for particles with just one dominant dimension. Kooi and Koelmans (2019) on the other hand proposed to use the relative ratio of particle sides (long:intermediate:short axes) to parameterize the different shape categories.\nAnother way to solve this issue is to use shape descriptors borrowed from sedimentology to define microplastic particles more accurately (van Melkebeke et al., 2020) and understand the role of the different shapes in the determination of particle size (Church, 2003). Here, the most important aspect of describing particle shapes lies in defining the principal dimensions (orthogonal long axis, L; intermediate axis, I; short axis, S), as the shape descriptors are mostly based on those dimensions (Blott and Pye, 2007). This includes, for example, the Wentworth flatness index (Wentworth, 1933) ([L\u00a0+\u00a0I]\/2S), the Krumbein intercept sphericity (Krumbein, 1941) (3I\n\n\u22122\n\nSL\n\n\u22122\n), the Corey Shape factor (Corey, 1949) (SL\n\n-\u00bd\n\nI\n\n-\u00bd\n), the Aschenbrenner working sphericity (Aschenbrenner, 1956) or the Janke shape factor (Janke, 1966). However, the process of defining and measuring the principal dimensions of irregular particles is highly error-prone, therefore Blott and Pye (2007) suggested for non-spherical sediments to follow the principle of the cube, where the principal dimensions are defined as the side lengths of the smallest imaginary cube which can contain the sediment grain. The principal dimensions also play different roles in the determination of characteristic particle size, depending on granulometric methodology. For natural sediments, sieving is most often used to measure the size of sand to gravel, and settling or optical techniques to measure the size of silt and clay. Sieve-based grain size is based on the retention of particles on the sieve, which is limited by I if all possible particle positions have been introduced to the sieve apertures (Tanner, 1995; Church, 2003), while settling and optical techniques can depend on both L and I (e.g. largest projected surface area), or all dimensions. As microplastics are more variable in their principal dimensions than most natural sediments (e.g. a fibre with L>\u00a0>\u00a0I=S) and sieve-based size selection is a common approach for size definition, this aspect needs to be taken into account when defining microplastic particle dimensions. Settling, on the other hand, is not used to determine sizes of microplastics, since many plastics are buoyant, and the method would have to be adapted to this.\nRegarding the description of the external geometrical form of natural sediments, Blott and Pye (2007) highlight four aspects that can - in combination - describe all kinds of sediment grains: form, roundness, irregularity and sphericity. Form describes the tridimensional characteristics and is defined by the ratio of the three principal particle dimensions (Sneed and Folk, 1958; Barrett, 1980). Roundness describes the degree of angularity (sharpness) of particle corners and edges (Powers, 1953). Irregularity is defined as the deviation of the particle shape from a regular body (Blott and Pye, 2007), and the sphericity is the degree to which a particle is similar to a sphere (Wadell, 1933). Only a combination of those descriptions is suitable to describe natural grains precisely, which seems to be the case for microplastics as well. For those, a combination of Corey shape factor, sphericity, circularity, elongation, flatness and aspect ratio is necessary to distinguish all microplastic shapes (van Melkebeke et al., 2020). Therefore, when describing microplastic particles, it is preferable to specify the principal dimensions, as a large number of shape descriptors can be identified on this basis, rather than relying on the conventional shape categories. However, we first need to find a way to reliably determine these principal particle dimensions.\n\n\n2.3\nDensity\nSediment densities vary typically between 1.5 and 3\u00a0g\/cm3, but, for simplicity, they are often assumed to be 2.65\u00a0g\/m3 (Chamley, 1990), the density of quartz sand. Although coarse (e.g. sand, gravel) mineral particles are generally conveyed individually, fine, cohesive mineral sediments are often transported in association with other mineral and organic materials as aggregates or flocs (Droppo et al., 1997). Floc formation is dependent on the frequency and energy of particle interactions as driven by concentration and hydrodynamic conditions, the electrostatic charge of particle surfaces, and the concentration and character of dissolved ions, increasing with salinity (Winterwerp et al., 2006; Winterwerp, 1998), resulting in flocs that are larger than the size of their constituent mineral grains, but generally have lower densities (1.0 to 1.4\u00a0g\/cm3) (Droppo, 2001; Faure et al., 2015; Maggi, 2005). The density of microplastics is mainly determined by the type of polymer that the particles consist of and varies between <0.05\u00a0g\/cm3 for expanded polystyrene and 2.3\u00a0g\/cm3 for polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) (Chubarenko et al., 2016). Microplastics can be transported in heterogeneous aggregates with other constituents such as organisms, suspended sediments, metal oxides and proteins as well (Yan et al., 2021), but the impact on the density seems to be more complex than for sediments. Heteroaggregation with inorganic particles such as suspended sediments and metal oxides results in a higher aggregate density (Wu et al., 2019; Leiser et al., 2020), while marine aggregation with other substances has been linked to a decrease in the aggregate density in comparison to the density of the individual microplastic particle (de Haan et al., 2019). While increasing salinity has been suggested to increase flocculation of microplastics (Andersen et al., 2021), the impact of the microplastic particle properties on floc formation has not been studied yet. Based on natural sediment floc formation and preliminary physical experiments, microplastic floc formation has been described by the fundamental metrics of collision frequency and the attachment efficiency (Besseling et al., 2017; Del Domercq et al., 2021). The collision frequency is dependent on particle size, density and concentration and the attachment frequency depends on the particle surface characteristics and the water chemistry. Undoubtedly, flocculation plays a crucial role in the particle properties distributions of microplastics in the aquatic environment and needs to be studied in more detail (Wang et al., 2020; Alimi et al., 2018).\nIn addition to aggregation and flocculation, the density of microplastics can change over time due to fragmentation, degradation and biofouling, although these density changes are yet to be quantified (Skalska et al., 2020). Fragmentation and degradation ostensibly decrease the density of microplastics by creating additional pore volume inside the particles (Ter Halle et al., 2016). The cracks that occur during fragmentation eventually lead to the particle breaking into smaller particles (Ter Halle et al., 2016), a process that has also been reported for natural sediments. Biofouling, the attachment of microorganisms and other organic particles on the surface of microplastics, can either increase or decrease the density of microplastic particles (Rummel et al., 2017). For buoyant microplastics, biofouling is suggested to increase density (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1975; Ye and Andrady, 1991; Fazey and Ryan, 2016; Kaiser et al., 2017), while in the case of \u2018high-density\u2019 polyurethane microplastics (1.26\u00a0g\/cm3), biofouling was found to decrease particle density (Nguyen et al., 2020). This might be due to the density range of naturally occurring organic matter (0.9\u20131.30\u00a0g\/cm3) (Harris, 2020). An increase in the density of initially buoyant plastic particles due to biofouling to more than 1\u00a0g\/cm3 (i.e. negatively buoyant) has been demonstrated in the aquatic environment after 6\u00a0weeks (Kaiser et al., 2017), 7\u00a0weeks (Ye and Andrady, 1991), or 3 to 4\u00a0months (Holmstr\u00f6m, 1975). Compared with the residence time of plastic in the natural environment (decades to centuries), the time to form effective biofouling is very short. Given the significantly lower density of the biofilm, biofouling on the surface of high density sediment particles will decrease the overall density of bio-sediment (Shang et al., 2014; Fang et al., 2017). However, while microplastic fate can be strongly influenced by biofouling (particles that used to float start to sink), sediments will remain negatively buoyant.\n\n\n\n3\nAquatic transport dynamics\nIn passing from fluvial to limnetic to the marine environment, sediments comprise different grain sizes from boulders and gravel upstream to sandy or clayey sediments closer to coastlines and oceans (Frings, 2008). While coarse grains are dominant in active areas with high flow velocities, fine and potentially cohesive sediments (i.e. mud and clay) can be found in hydrodynamically calm areas, e.g. close to the banks and on bar tops or within vegetation (Braat et al., 2017; van de Lageweg et al., 2018; Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020; Browne et al., 2010; Zhang, 2017; Yao et al., 2019). The occurrence of microplastics has been linked to finer grain size fractions of sediments (Enders et al., 2019), suggesting that similar mechanisms govern their distribution. This empirical evidence raises questions on how the processes behind the transport, resuspension and deposition of different sediment sizes and microplastics relate, and if we can use our understanding of sediment transport processes to describe the transport of microplastics across aquatic systems. Although evidence exists for aeolian and terrestrial transport of microplastics (Dris et al., 2016), the bulk of the literature concerns sediment and microplastic transport by water, which is why we focus here solely on the latter. Moreover, we focus on transport by flow and currents, and neglect transport by wind waves for the most part.\n\n3.1\nOnset of motion\nSeveral empirically derived sediment transport predictors can be used to describe resuspension of various types of sediments (Kleinhans, 2002). Generally, erosion can be estimated as a function of the hydrodynamic stress (i.e. excess shear stress) induced by currents or waves as well as a measure of the erodibility of the sediment often referred to as critical bed shear stress or critical velocity. Erosion occurs when the stresses induced by the hydrodynamic forces at the bed exceed the resuspension threshold of the sediment, which depends mainly on particle size, shape and density and can be estimated using the well-known Shield's diagram (Shields, 1936; Coleman and Nikora, 2008; Dey et al., 2019). Although the Shields' curve neglects interactions between multiple grain sizes both in suspension (e.g. flocculation) and at the bed (e.g. hiding, exposure, sediment sorting, cohesion), it is valuable for a first assessment of resuspension. While several field studies showed that microplastic abundance can be related to sediment grain size (Enders et al., 2019; Vianello et al., 2013; Ballent et al., 2016; Maes et al., 2018), other research measured resuspension thresholds for microplastics, allowing us to describe them through similar metrics (Ballent et al., 2012; Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019a). The resuspension behaviour of microplastics is particularly dependent on the particle shape and size as well as the particle size distribution of the sediment in the bed. When comparing critical shear stresses of a variety of microplastic particles that were determined in physical model experiments with the Shields' diagram (Shields, 1936), microplastics seem to be transported significantly earlier than calculated (Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019a). This indicates a higher mobility of microplastic particles compared to same-sized sediment grains, although this result depends on the used definition of on-set of motion (e.g. first particle movement, movement of 50% of grains) (Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019a). However, data on microplastic erosion dynamics is yet limited when compared to research on sediment dynamics from decades ago (e.g. van Rijn, 1984a). More in-depth studies, covering a wider range of microplastic parameters and testing different definitions of the onset of motion, are necessary to derive general resuspension behaviour expressions.\n\n\n3.2\nTransport modes of sediments and microplastics\nSediment and microplastic transport modes in the aquatic environment can be classified into surface, suspended, and bedload transport (Fig. 1\n) (Cowger et al., 2021a; van Rijn, 1984a; van Rijn, 1984b; Ancey, 2020). Surface load is the transport of larger, positively buoyant particles with high rising velocities that resist downward turbulent mixing, and are thus found primarily near the free surface. Suspended particulate transport is predominantly a phenomenon where the settling or rising of particles through the flow field is counteracted by the turbulence of the flow field itself. Bedload is the transport of larger particles with high settling velocities relative to turbulent fluctuations in the flow field that results in sliding, rolling and saltation of particles over the bed. Here we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these three transport modes for sediments and how they can be applied to microplastic transport.\n\n3.2.1\nSurface transport\nSurface transport occurs when the particle buoyancy forces are greater than the turbulent mixing forces, a process that is rarely observed for natural sediments due to their high density. For microplastics on the other hand, surface transport has been observed in rivers (Lenaker et al., 2019) and is one of the most studied modes of transport of microplastics in the oceans (van Sebille et al., 2020). At large scales, surface currents can concentrate plastics in eddies in the centre of the oceans while windrows (Langmuir turbulence) have the same effect at smaller scales (van Sebille et al., 2020). Although such eddies can also exist in rivers, the concentration of plastics in them has not been studied in detail. Currently, sampling is often restricted to the water surface with the concentrations being extrapolated to the entire water column, with very limited knowledge about the vertical distribution of microplastics over the water column (Skalska et al., 2020). Buoyant microplastic concentrations seem to decrease with increasing water depth (Lenaker et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018; Gardon et al., 2021), thus to estimate the actual microplastics transport volumes in water bodies, it is essential to study the concentrations along the entire water column (Eo et al., 2019; Pabortsava and Lampitt, 2020).\n\n\n3.2.2\nSuspended transport\nThe governing equation describing suspended sediment transport is the advection-diffusion equation, which is typically derived using mass conservation in conjunction with Reynold's decomposition and averaging, and Fick's law (Fischer et al., 1979; Socolofsky and Jirka, 2005). The advection-diffusion equation for particle transport can be written as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\nu\n\u00af\n\ni\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2202\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\nt\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n+\nS\n\n\nwhere \n\nc\n\u00af\n\n is the particle concentration (e.g. microplastics), t is time, \n\nu\n\u00af\n\n is mean velocity of the transported quantity, D\n\nt\n is turbulent diffusivity, the overbar operator denotes time-averaging, x\n\ni\n is the local coordinate in longitudinal (x), transverse (y) and bed-normal (z) directions, and S is a term for sources and sinks, which may comprise entrainment, deposition and infiltration processes of microplastics. Note that in Eq. (1), the turbulent diffusivity is a scalar, but it can also be a vector, for example if the diffusivity in the vertical direction is different from the horizontal directions, or even more generally the diffusivity can be a tensor (Spivakovskaya et al., 2007). It must be noted that turbulence is non-homogeneous and anisotropic in aquatic environments, which implies that turbulent diffusivities can vary in space and time. Eq. (1) assumes one-way coupling, meaning that particles are being passively transported by a turbulent flow without any feedback to the water flow.\nEq. (1) is a general three-dimensional advection-diffusion equation and can be solved numerically, given that flow velocities, turbulent diffusivities, sources and sinks are known. Simplified analytical solutions of Eq. (1) have been derived with relative success for both sediment and microplastic transport. For example, the assumption of uniform turbulence (Rouse, 1937; Dey, 2014) leads to:\n\n(2)\n\n\nD\nt\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\u2202\nz\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nc\n\u00af\n\nw\n\n\nwhich can, based on the Boussinesq hypothesis and assuming the preservation of the logarithmic law of velocity distribution over the entire depth as described in Dey (2014), be integrated to:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\nc\n\u00af\n\n\na\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nz\nh\n\n\n\nz\nh\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\na\nh\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\na\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\nc\nt\n\nw\n\n\n\u03ba\n\nu\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere a is a reference level (length), h is the water depth (length), Sc\n\nt\n is the turbulent Schmidt number (Gualtieri et al., 2017) (dimensionless), w is the settling\/rising velocity (length\/time), \u03ba is the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant (dimensionless, 0.41), u\n\n\u204e\n is the friction velocity (length\/time). Note that in Eq. (3), turbulent diffusivities are expressed in terms of u\n\n\u204e\n, \u03ba and the turbulent Schmidt number, which is the ratio between a parabolic eddy viscosity and the turbulent diffusivity of microplastics, taking values between Sc\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a00.7 to 1.4, and a common value of Sc\n\nt\n\u00a0=\u00a01.0 as a first guess in many environmental applications, see Gualtieri et al. (2017) and de Leeuw et al. (2020).\nEq. (3) is also known as the Rouse-equation and has been successfully applied to predict the vertical concentration of suspended microplastics (Cowger et al., 2021a) while a variety of other diffusion models exist (Dey, 2014). In rivers, the longitudinal distribution of suspended sediment and plastic particles is dominated by a process called longitudinal dispersion, characterised through combined effects of advection and vertical diffusion (Socolofsky and Jirka, 2005). Cook et al. (2020) showed that neutrally buoyant microplastic particles followed theoretical dispersion theory in laboratory uniform open channel flow, while it is known that longitudinal dispersion coefficients may vary significantly in natural river channels (Rutherford, 1994).\nThe settling and rising velocities are a key parameter in Eq. (3) and several studies have determined those for different microplastic particles in physical experiments (van Melkebeke et al., 2020; Khatmullina and Isachenko, 2017; Kaiser et al., 2019; Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019b; Waldschl\u00e4ger et al., 2020). A comparison with theoretical approaches from classical sediment transport for calculating settling velocities yielded only inaccurate results for microplastics (Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019b), whereas the use of shape-dependent drag models seems to be a better fit (van Melkebeke et al., 2020). This indicates that the shape of microplastics is possibly more significant for their transport than it is for natural sediments, also highlighted by the higher variation of aspect ratios (longest\/shortest side length) of microplastics in comparison to natural sediments (Kooi et al., 2018; van Hateren et al., 2020). The importance of the particle shape can be explained by the significantly higher resistance depending on both preferential orientation (DiBenedetto et al., 2018), and more pronounced secondary movements in the sinking and rising process of the either rigid or deformable microplastic particles (van Melkebeke et al., 2020; Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019b; Waldschl\u00e4ger et al., 2020). Deformable particles have different settling characteristics from rigid particles as their shape changes during transport (Ardekani et al., 2017). This behaviour has already been shown for microplastic foils (Waldschl\u00e4ger et al., 2020), but a comparative description of the deformability of different microplastic particles has not yet been carried out.\nFlocculation and aggregation can influence the settling behaviour of both sediments and microplastics. For natural sediments, the floc settling velocities are far smaller than for grains of the same size, but usually higher than that of the individual grains of which they are composed (Williams et al., 2008). Thus, flocculation tends to enhance deposition of fine sediments in aquatic systems. The same trend has been reported for flocculated microplastics (Alimi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Since microplastics have generally lower particle densities they can form relatively larger and denser flocs than the incorporated microplastics particles, which may result in higher deposition rates for given hydrodynamic conditions. As already discussed above, biofouling can either increase or decrease the density of microplastics, influencing the settling and rising behaviour in various ways. Kooi et al. (2017) hypothesise that microplastic particles exhibit oscillatory behaviour in the marine environment as a result of biofouling, in which the biofilm initially grows and causes the particle to sink. This effect diminishes towards deeper water layers due to the lack of sunlight, causing the particle to rise again. Additionally, size-specific removal of smaller microplastics due to biofouling from the surface has been observed in models (Kooi et al., 2017; Kvale et al., 2020a; Kreczak et al., 2021).\n\n\n3.2.3\nBedload transport\nBedload transport denotes the near-bed movement of particles. The main modes of near-bed movement of microplastics are presumably the same as for natural sediments (Stubbins et al., 2021), namely sliding, rolling and saltation. Natural sediments transported as bedload (i.e. in continuous contact with the bed) differ mostly in diameter but are similar in density, and shape (mainly ellipsoidal due to abrasion and weathering). Bedload transport of microplastics, instead, needs a more detailed description in terms of particle characteristics due to their variety of shapes and densities, which leads to more complex transport (Kooi and Koelmans, 2019; Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2019a). Although to date no study has intentionally focussed on bedload transport of microplastics, some studies theorized that bedload transport potentially generates smaller plastic particles through collisions with the bed (Morritt et al., 2014). Physical experiments adopted plastic grains rather than natural sediments to take advantage of their higher mobility starting from the \u201870s (Bettess, 1990), providing an extended body of literature that potentially holds some insights on microplastic near-bed transport. However, it must be noted that those experimental setups saw uniform microplastic particles moving on a microplastic bed, whereas in nature diverse microplastics move along a bed of natural sediments with significantly higher particle densities, presumably influencing transport. Thus, past research can specifically be used to elucidate the mechanics behind particle entrainment and near-bed motion of microplastics (Dey et al., 2019), but will not suffice to accurately parameterize bedload transport.\n\n\n3.2.4\nTurbidity currents\nAnother near-bed transport mode of importance for both microplastic and sediment transport are turbidity currents. Those currents have been recognized to distribute and bury large quantities of microplastics in seafloor sediments (Kane and Clare, 2019; Pohl et al., 2020). The loading of sediment from a river system into an open body of water could entrain and prograde natural and anthropogenic particles into the offshore as hyperpycnal (the flow in a river mouth that is denser than the water in the open water body receiving it and thus flows beneath the basin water) and hypopycnal (the flow in a river mouth that is less dense than the water in the open water body receiving it and thus flows above the basin water) flows (Warrick and Milliman, 2003; Renault and Gierlowski-Kordesch, 2010). In a series of experiments, Pohl et al. (2020) showed that a turbidity current carrying both microplastic particles and fibres developed a deposit relatively enriched in microfibres implying that microfibres were being trapped by settling sand grains at the base of the flow, while microplastic particles were transported on the bed. Notably, Pierdomenico et al. (2019) determined that a hyperpycnal density flow can transport pollutants offshore into water depths of >1000\u00a0m. This suggests that submarine channels can act as long-term pathways of microplastics transport and deposition into the sea, extending from the canyon into the deeper basin and depositing beyond the channel mouth (Kane and Fildani, 2021). Microplastics initially transported by turbidity currents may be entrained by dense thermohaline bottom currents, which build large seafloor deposits known as contourites (Kane et al., 2020). Additionally, the microplastics-sediment transport mechanisms into lakes are poorly understood. This is concerning as density\/turbidity currents in bedload dominated rivers play an important role in sediment, organic matter and nutrient dispersal within a lake (Marti et al., 2011).\n\n\n3.2.5\nVertical transport in the sediment bed\nFine sediment and microplastic particles that are transported near the bed have the potential to be incorporated into coarser bed materials through hyporheic filtration (filtration into the transition area between river water and groundwater) (Karwan and Saiers, 2012). The migration of fine sediment particles into the hyporheic zone beneath the channel bed depends on horizontal and interstitial flows (Mathers and Wood, 2016), particle sinking properties (Sch\u00e4lchli and Sch\u00e4lchli, 1992), gravitational processes (Hauer et al., 2019) and water turbulence (Sch\u00e4lchli and Sch\u00e4lchli, 1992). While some knowledge exists on microplastic concentrations in hyporheic sediment (Frei et al., 2019; Drummond et al., 2020), only few studies have investigated depth-dependent concentrations in the sediment bed or hyporheic filtration of microplastics (Frei et al., 2019; Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2020). They found that (i) vertical migration of microplastic particles into sediment beds occurs, (ii) smaller particle diameters lead to higher infiltration depths, and (iii) spherical particles migrate more easily than irregularly shaped microplastics. Infiltration depths depend on the mean grain size of the hyporheic sediment matrix and the ratio between microplastic diameter and mean grain size was identified as an indicator for the migration depth (Waldschl\u00e4ger and Sch\u00fcttrumpf, 2020), which is similar to fine sediment hyporheic filtration, where the infiltration is dependent on the ratio between fine sediment diameter and bed sediment diameter (Schruff, 2018).\n\n\n\n3.3\nModification of aquatic transport processes by biota\n\n3.3.1\nImpact of micro- and macrobenthic organisms on aquatic transport\nBiota can both stabilize and disturb sediments. Benthic organisms can stabilize local sediments via the formation of biofilms or lead to the deposition of fine sediments in deeper soil layers via the formation of burrows by causing vertical mixing or ingestion (Herman et al., 2001; Widdows et al., 2004; Paarlberg et al., 2005; Montserrat et al., 2008). Biofilms enhance the sediment's stability against erosion by increasing the critical shear stress and can increase local cohesiveness, which affects the transport of the sediment (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020; Borsje et al., 2009). Similar to a stabilization of sediment by biofilms, microbenthic species likely stabilize microplastics in aquatic sediments as well (Hope et al., 2020), which affects their residence times and capacity to migrate into the deeper layers of the bed.\nBy contrast, macrobenthic organisms living on or in the sediment bed can disturb the sediment through bioturbation, for instance as a result of their feeding and mating behaviour (Coco et al., 2006; Le Hir et al., 2007; Cozzoli et al., 2018; Cozzoli et al., 2019). The destabilization of the sediment bed by bioturbation can result from the creation of burrows directly deteriorating the structure of the sediment matrix or indirectly through an increase of surface roughness by the creation of mounds or scrapes (Le Hir et al., 2007). Reworking of the sediment bed by bioturbation leads to increasing sediment fluxes towards the water column and subsequent dispersion or transport towards the ocean (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2021). Although bioturbation can be described by a variation of the erodibility of the sediment (Cozzoli et al., 2019), uncertainties in quantifying the effects of macrobenthic species are related to the high variability of species, their abundances, interactions and complex life-cycles (Le Hir et al., 2007). Vertical mixing into the sediment bed has been observed for conveyor-belt feeding behaviour of some deposit feeders (e.g. the worm Tubifex tubifex) through ingestion that leads to changes in distribution of sediment grains. While there is an increasing abundance of studies looking at the effects of ecotoxicology induced by microplastics, few studies discuss the change in microplastic resuspension, deposition and distribution in sediments mediated by macrobenthic organisms. Evidence exists however, for burial of microplastics into the deeper layers of the sediment through bioturbation and vertical mixing (Gebhardt and Forster, 2018; Coppock et al., 2021; Thit et al., 2020), suggesting that microplastic distribution in sediment can be affected by the reworking of sediments (Thit et al., 2020; N\u00e4kki et al., 2019) or by ingestion if sufficiently small.\nMore attention is required to quantify vertical transport of microplastics into the sediment bed, the interactions between benthic organisms and microplastic distribution and the role of biota in enhancing or reducing microplastic resuspension. The consequences of microplastic burrowing and distribution in sediments are crucial for predicting the transport and accumulation of these pollutants. Inevitably, the mediated resuspension of fines will naturally affect the resuspension of microplastics, which possibly results in increasing fluxes of microplastics and reduced residence times within the local sediment (D\u00fcrr et al., 2011).\n\n\n3.3.2\nImpact of vegetation on aquatic transport\nThe effects of vegetation on flow and sediment transport have been studied extensively on various spatial and temporal scales. While a breadth of papers discusses the effects of small-scale feedbacks between stems, local flow and sediment transport (Shan et al., 2020; Tinoco et al., 2020), an increasing number of studies investigate the emergence of scale-dependent feedbacks that determine transport rates and morphology from the patch to system-scale, such as the formation of tidal channels between vegetation patches (Temmerman et al., 2007) or the evolution of landforms (Mariotti, 2018; Gurnell et al., 2012; Nardin et al., 2018). Many of these studies showed that vegetation effects are highly species-specific, depending on emergent and submerged vegetation, flexibility of the stem, leaves, roots, and life-history traits (Baptist et al., 2007; Bij de Vaate et al., 2020).\nIn general, flow through a canopy can be described as a drag force that depends on the frontal area of the vegetation and vegetation-specific properties, such as stem flexibility or leaf area (Chapman et al., 2015). This force leads to a reduction in flow velocity, directly affecting the transport rates described by Eqs. (1) and (3). Vegetation also affects local turbulence and bed shear stresses, directly mediating resuspension and sediment transport rates (San Juan et al., 2019). At the same time, rooting structures enhance soil stability, increasing the resuspension threshold of the sediment (Abernethy and Rutherfurd, 2001). Around vegetation patches, flow velocities are accelerated, increasing resuspension and transport rates, thus creating near-field feedbacks between vegetation and flow with a spatial redistribution of particles and emerging morphological features (Br\u00fcckner et al., 2020; Temmerman et al., 2007; Lera et al., 2019).\nDespite the existing literature on vegetation effects on sediment transport, there are still many unknowns on the mediation of microplastic transport by vegetation (Zhang, 2017). Enhanced microplastics deposition is reported from both riverine and coastal ecosystems including riparian vegetation and freshwater wetlands (Yin et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2021), mangroves (Martin et al., 2020), salt marshes (Stead et al., 2020), seagrasses (Kreitsberg et al., 2021; Sanchez-Vidal et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020), but also coral (Jeyasanta et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021) and algae (Peller et al., 2021). Similar to sediments, species characteristics, abundance, shoot height, density, and leaf area index are considered to be key factors impacting the magnitude of flow alterations and microplastic accumulation and storage (Bouma et al., 2013; Helcoski et al., 2020). However, more studies are needed to investigate vegetation-induced changes on (i) microplastics resuspension through altered turbulence, (ii) microplastic transport within and close to vegetation structures, and (ii) deposition rates both at the local and larger scale. Laboratory and field studies can elucidate if we can apply our understanding of sediment transport within canopies to microplastic transport, and can provide appropriate thresholds that allow for upscaling to the larger scale in numerical models.\n\n\n\n3.4\nNumerical transport modelling\nNumerical models can be used to describe the spatial and temporal transport of a variety of particles in the aquatic environment (Papanicolaou et al., 2008), including microplastics and sediments, and add to our understanding of their distribution. Depending on the nature and the complexity of the problem that is addressed, the data availability for model calibration and verification, as well as the available resources (time & budget), models can be selected according to their spatial resolution: (Papanicolaou et al., 2008) zero-dimensional (0D, basin-output models), one-dimensional (1D, river\/reach or water-column models), two-dimensional (2D, reach scale, floodplain, cross section-models) or three-dimensional (3D, including Langragian models). A variety of numerical models have been developed to model sediment transport, exchange processes such as settling and resuspension, and biotic effects, along with point and diffusive source pollutants attached to sediments (Papanicolaou et al., 2008; Peller et al., 2021). Likewise, numerical models have been developed to capture different microplastic transport processes (e.g. Nizzetto et al., 2016; Besseling et al., 2017; van Sebille et al., 2012). However, only few models on microplastic transport exist, meaning that the possibilities that numerical modelling offers - and that have already been exploited for sediment transport - are not yet exhausted. Table 1\n compares sediment and microplastic modelling approaches and highlights the potential for microplastic research.\n\n3.4.1\nZero-dimensions models\n0D-models are time-dependent but have no spatial dependency. Basins are modelled as a box, where processes need to be parameterised. 0D-models are often implemented into higher-dimensional models to include basic processes (Cui et al., 2021). In sediment research, 0D-models have been used, for example, to predict soil loss from a field based on field parameters (Universal Soil Loss equation) (Stone and Hilborn, 2012), to model the concave longitudinal profile of a schematized alluvial river assuming a constant river width and length and a time-dependent bed composition (Franzoia and Nones, 2017), to investigate bathymetry changes in tidal environments over many decades with a simplified cohesive sediment transport model (Schoellhamer et al., 2008) or to model the aggregation of oil and natural sediments and to conduct sensitivity tests of fractal dimension and collision efficiency (Cui et al., 2021).\nSeveral 0D-models have been built to estimate microplastic fluxes, including models that quantify plastic emissions from land to the oceans based on population density (Jambeck et al., 2015; Lebreton et al., 2017), models that calculate the probability for plastics to enter a river and subsequently the ocean based on geographically distributed data on plastic waste, land use, wind and precipitation (Meijer et al., 2021), or models that simulates fragmentation and settling on a whole-ocean scale (Jambeck et al., 2015; Koelmans et al., 2017).\nThe advantage of these simple relations is the low computational cost that allows for long term trend analyses in microplastic production, large spatial distributions and multiple scenarios. These models can be used as input for more complex models. Based on the already available 0D-models from sediment transport, modelling particle aggregation and flocculation of microplastics with natural sediments and biofouling seems to be an important and feasible step to improve our understanding of microplastic budgets in the future.\n\n\n3.4.2\nOne-dimensional models\nHydrodynamic 1D-models have been used for sediment transport since the early 1980s and are able to predict basic parameters (bulk velocity, water surface elevation, bed-elevation variation and sediment transport load and concentration) of a particular system (Papanicolaou et al., 2008). Application of 1D-models include simulations of flow and sediment transport along streams (Thomas and Prasuhn, 1977; Karim and Kennedy, 1982; Chang, 1984; Schick et al., 1998), mobile-bed dynamics (Holly et al., 1990), predictions of grain size distributions and bedload rates in rivers (Papanicolaou et al., 2008) and vertical distribution of suspended sediment and oil-sediment aggregates in the marine and fluvial environment (Cui et al., 2021). For a detailed description of the numerics of particle-based water-column models, see for example Gr\u00e4we (2011) and Nordam et al. (2019).\n1D microplastic transport models have been developed for river (sub-)catchments, assuming homogeneous mixing of plastics in the water column (Nizzetto et al., 2016; Besseling et al., 2017; Unice et al., 2019). These models include processes like aggregation, degradation, settling and resuspension, and can be used for hotspot analysis, quantification of catchment emissions and a better understanding of the relative importance of different processes. However, as parameterization of most of the mentioned processes has not been derived for microplastics yet, caution is required with regard to the validity of the models' assumptions and results (Wichmann et al., 2019). Other 1D models focus on the vertical distribution of microplastics (Cowger et al., 2021a), the effect of biofouling on the settling of particles (Kooi et al., 2017), or the effect of wind-mixing on the vertical distribution of particles in the upper part of the ocean water column (Kukulka et al., 2012). Understanding the vertical distribution of microplastics is relevant both in terms of predicting the mean transport rates across a profile along a river, but also to estimate particle concentrations to better describe particle interactions, diffusion into the bed and ecotoxicological consequences.\nThe big advantage of 1D-models is the low computational requirements in comparison to 2D and 3D-models as well as their simplicity of use (Papanicolaou et al., 2008), while being more process-oriented than 0D-models. They are useful to understand transport rates and concentrations along the vertical or horizontal profile, describing in more detail where sediments and microplastics are transported (Rouse, 1937; Nizzetto et al., 2016; Cowger et al., 2021a; Kooi et al., 2017). Major assumptions of 1D-models are the absence of lateral and vertical exchange of particles across the channel and floodplains, or the assumption of horizontal homogeneity in the case of water-column models. Based on the already available 1D-models from sediment transport, bedload microplastic transport could be addressed in the future, but it would require specific empirical relationships.\n\n\n3.4.3\nTwo-dimensional models\nSince the early 1990s, more 2D sediment transport models have been used, as they allowed easy data input and visualization of the modelling results (Papanicolaou et al., 2008). As opposed to 0D- and 1D-models, 2D approaches allow for a more detailed representation of the lateral transport field. The vertical component is still considered in average terms and thus these models are often referred to as 2D depth-averaged models. Applications of 2D-models include investigations of the transport of radionuclides (Walters et al., 1982; Voitsekhovitch et al., 1994), simulations of sediment transport processes and bed-level changes in limnic, fluvial and coastal environments (Papanicolaou et al., 2008; Walstra et al., 1998; Niyyati and Maraghei, 2002; Czuba et al., 2015), predictions of sediment transport rates (Danish Hydraulic Institute, 1993) and investigation of the effects of local changes of the waterflow, e.g. by woody debris, rocks and anthropogenic structures, on sediment transport (Danish Hydraulic Institute, 1993; Wu et al., 2005; Jia and Wang, 1999). They can capture cross-sectional variations in morphology and velocity and can therefore estimate variations in transport rates across different water depths and lateral exchanges (Papanicolaou et al., 2008). Furthermore, 2D-models can predict total sediment transport load as well as multifractional sediment transport and can decompose the total sediment load into bedload and suspended load (e.g. Jia and Wang, 1999; Spasojevic and Holly, 1990; Lee et al., 1997; Chang, 1998).\n2D mass balance models that predict microplastics concentrations and emissions on a catchment scale have been made both for Europe (Siegfried et al., 2017) and the world (van Wijnen et al., 2019). These steady-state models consider removal via settling and\/or degradation, and in the case of van Wijnen et al. (2019) also fragmentation. Several 2D-models have been made that describe microplastic concentrations and processes in lakes (Cable et al., 2017; Hoffman and Hittinger, 2017; Mason et al., 2020). Some of these models include beaching as a removal process (Hoffman and Hittinger, 2017; Mason et al., 2020). A few of the early models of ocean plastic transport were 2D Lagrangian particle models (van Sebille et al., 2012; van Sebille et al., 2015; Maximenko et al., 2012). These models used surface tracers to predict how plastics move across the surface of the ocean. River networks have also been models regarding microplastic concentration introduced by point sources (Schmidt et al., 2020).\nBased on the already available 2D-models from sediment transport, possibilities arise to model multifractional microplastic transport to include the highly varying particle properties of microplastics (size, shape, density) and observe their impact on microplastic transport. However, to implement those varying particle properties and their impact on the transport, we first need to parameterise these variables and processes. Additionally, the distribution of the total microplastic transport into surface, suspended and bedload-transport could be investigated in the future. This could be based on the probability function for microplastic density, diameter and shape developed from Kooi and Koelmans (2019) and Kooi et al. (2021). Differently from mineral sediment transport, microplastic particles may experience physical changes at the transport scale represented by these models.\n\n\n3.4.4\nThree-dimensional models\nWhen looking at complex flow situations, for example around hydraulic structures, only 3D-models are able to represent the physics and to predict sediment transport (Papanicolaou et al., 2008) with adequate accuracy. Applications for sedimentary 3D-models include simulations of flow and sediment transport processes (HydroQual, 1998; Hamrick, 1992; Admass, 2005), simulations of sedimentation on bends, crossings and distributaries (Spasojevic and Holly, 1994), simulations of water quality (Jacobsen and Rasmussen, 1997; Delft Hydraulics, 1999) and simulation of the transport of chemicals (Bierman et al., 1992; Gu and Chung, 2003). Depending on the used model, simulations of movable riverbeds, bedforms, sediment sorting and armouring processes (Olsen, 1994), flocculation models for cohesive sediment (Winterwerp, 1998) as well as exchange of metals between the bed sediment and the water column (Danish Hydraulic Institute, 1993) and implementation of parameters such as salinity, temperature, suspended sediment and their influence on density (King, 1998) are possible. These simulations can range from local to global scales (Papanicolaou et al., 2008). Similar to 2D-models, some 3D-models are able to predict sediment transport of sediment mixtures (Hamrick, 1992; Spasojevic and Holly, 1994; Olsen, 1994; Song and Haidvogel, 1994).\nBoth Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches can be used in 3D-models. While Eulerian modelling characterises how a particle concentration changes at a fixed grid of points, or cells, the Lagrangian description, also known as \u2018particle tracking\u2019, simulates particle transport by modelling the position of a collection of (numerical) particles. Mathematically, Eulerian and Lagrangian models are equivalent, and which formulation is most suitable will depend on the scenario to be modelled. Initially, Lagrangian drifters have only been used to model the surface transport of passive plastics particles in the oceans (van Sebille et al., 2012; Maximenko et al., 2012). Since then, Lagrangian models approximated biological transport by spatially constant removal rates and modelled non-conservative particles (Isobe et al., 2019), subsurface advection (Wichmann et al., 2019), as well as implemented a 1D-biofouling model (Kooi et al., 2017) to estimate sinking timescales for biofouled, initially buoyant microplastics in the global oceans (Daily and Hoffman, 2020). Daily and Hoffman (2020) also modelled the distribution of microplastics in the water column and the sediment of Lake Erie by using a Lagrangian transport model that implemented advection, density-driven sinking, and turbulent mixing. 3D Lagrangian methods can also be applied to smaller scales, and have been used to study the fate of non-buoyant microplastics in the surf-zone of beaches (Jongedijk et al., 2020). Eulerian models have so far been used to assess the effect of buoyancy and idealized removal on the global microplastic transport by implementing particles with different densities (Mountford and Morales Maqueda, 2019), as well as to embed microplastics in an earth system model that includes coastlines and major shipping lanes as input sources and biological interaction - aggregation of microplastics with marine snow and ingestion of microplastics by zooplankton - as a possible sink (Kvale et al., 2020b). Mountford and Morales Maqueda (2019) have thereby implemented the 0D-model by Jambeck et al. (2015) and van Sebille et al. (2015) on plastic emissions into their model, highlighting the possibilities to further develop low-dimensional models.\nSeveral processes that might impact microplastic transport are not implemented in 3D-models yet. Wichmann et al. (2019) identify a number of processes that are not implemented in their model, but which presumably have an important influence on the transport behaviour of microplastics: particle properties such as composition, size and shape of microplastics, time-dependent processes such as biofouling, fragmentation and degradation, beaching of microplastics on coasts, e.g. by breaking waves, as well as oceanographic phenomena such as upwelling and tides. However, the temporal and spatial influences of most of these processes on microplastics transport have not yet been parameterized, so that an implementation in numerical models is accompanied by large uncertainties (Wichmann et al., 2019). Mountford and Morales Maqueda (2019) point out the importance of implementing microplastic-sediment interactions to improve their model in the future. Lobelle et al. (2021) highlights the need to implement particles with different shapes and fragmentation properties as soon as there are mathematical descriptions for them. Based on the already available 3D sediment models, the implementation of multifractional microplastics should be possible in the near future to improve the transport modelling of diverse microplastics. Additionally, the interaction between turbulence in different flows on different microplastic particles could be investigated by high-fidelity 3D-models (Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), see Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n4\nEnvironmental sampling techniques\nInitial studies that reported microplastics in the environment did so incidentally while sampling for other substances, thus protocols and observations are shaped by this historic legacy (Jongedijk et al., 2020). However, to understand the fate of microplastics within the environment, it is essential to collect representative environmental samples. Furthermore, ground-truthed environmental concentration values are necessary to validate models displaying microplastic emissions, transport pathways, and hotspots (van Emmerik et al., 2019; Weiss et al., 2021). Moreover, microplastics can be used in terms of geochronology. The detection in a sediment layer offers information on the maximum deposition time. Since the mass production of plastics started in the 1950s, prior deposition in the environment is very unlikely (Weber and Lechthaler, 2021). In addition, using contaminants in sediments as tracer to reconstruct floodplain chronology is a common technique regarding heavy metals and was transferred to microplastics where similar patterns in floodplain sediment deposition could have been shown (Lechthaler et al., 2021).\nSince there are already numerous techniques for sampling the water column and sediment, an evaluation of their transferability is a new and important research aspect. Here, the suitability of these techniques for microplastic sampling, as well as detection and classification (shape, colour, size, polymer) of microplastics in sediment deposits, the water column, snow and ice are discussed, resulting in the identification of areas to be addressed in future research.\n\n4.1\nField sample collection\nThe choice of field sampling technique depends on the environmental matrix and the portion of the microplastics size distribution targeted by the sampling plan. A variety of techniques have traditionally been deployed to sample sediment deposits with grain sizes comparable to those of microplastics (clay, silt, sand and gravel) (Table 2\n). Bulk sediment samples, collected through grab (e.g. Ponar or Van Veen grab), coring, trapping (Storlazzi et al., 2011; Tidjani et al., 2011), or drilling techniques (Kondolf et al., 2003), can equally be used to assess natural sediment or microplastics. The differentiation of target material is later achieved in the laboratory during separation. Similar to sediments, snow and ice sampling for microplastics can be conducted much as with sediment sampling through grab, core or drill sampling, and faces many of the same benefits and challenges for each technique (Bergmann et al., 2019; La Kanhai et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2020). In aquatic environments, differences in techniques may be necessary when samples are being sourced at different water depths. Suspended sediment samples are typically collected isokinetically, where the suspended sediment mixture undergoes no change in speed or direction as it enters the mouth of the sampler, either integrated across channel depth or depth and width (i.e. flow integrated), or at a given depth using horizontal water samplers such as the Van Dorn (Wren et al., 2000; Davis, n.d.). Suspended sediment samples for microplastic analysis have been also collected using sediment traps (Lorenz et al., 2019; Bagheri et al., 2020; Fraser et al., 2020; Rios Mendoza et al., 2021). Microplastics on the other hand are sampled using filtration (i.e. using nets, sieves or filters), or are collected as grab sample (i.e. using a bucket). Microplastics concentration and character can vary widely for all environmental media (e.g. < 10\u22123 to >105 particles per litre), resulting in representative sample sizes that range from less than 1\u00a0l to multiple m3, depending also on the targeted microplastics and scientific questions (Shahul Hamid et al., 2018).\n\n4.1.1\nPossible routes for advances in sampling using known sediment techniques\nMultiple approaches to sediment sampling and characterization including in-situ and remote optical techniques have been used to monitor fluvial and marine sediment transport for decades (Lynch et al., 1994), with notable recent advances (Czuba et al., 2015). Optical turbidity sensors have been used since the mid-20th century for continuous, point-based monitoring of suspended sediment concentration if paired with appropriate bulk water sampling for calibration and validation (Hitomi et al., 2021; Simmons et al., 2020). Reflectance-based remote sensing of suspended load with aerial and satellite imagery has been used since the late-20th century, with some success for sediments (Warrick and Milliman, 2003; Stumpf and Pennock, 1989; Volpe et al., 2011). Although the detection of microplastics from aerial and satellite imagery is still unfeasible due to image resolution capabilities, measurements of ocean surface roughness by low Earth orbiting bistatic radars have recently been used to detect and imagine marine microplastic concentrations (Evans and Ruf, 2021). Additionally, hyperspectral imagery has been shown to be able to capture microplastic characteristics in samples collected from aquatic and terrestrial environments (Shan et al., 2019; Serranti et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018) demonstrating the potential for this approach to speed up identification of microplastics in the laboratory. Recently, advances in acoustic (e.g. Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers) and laser-diffraction techniques have permitted the in-situ sampling of concentrations and grain-sizes of natural sediments (Holdaway et al., 1999; Pedocchi and Garc\u00eda, 2006; Smeardon and Thorne, 2008; Sassi et al., 2012). Unfortunately, extension of each of these techniques to direct monitoring of microplastics in aquatic systems is unlikely because of the very low concentrations of microplastics relative to limits of detection and the need to distinguish the backscatter signatures of microplastics from that of natural sediment.\nFlow integrated sampling (i.e. representatively sampling every part of a channel cross section flow field) has been the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for sediments, although its accuracy is still a challenge (Gitto et al., 2017). Microplastic research would benefit from testing flow integrated sampling strategies in the field, as there are still several issues with current microplastic sampling techniques: a lack of a uniform microplastics sampling has resulted in the propagation of errors into global estimates of microplastic fluxes to the ocean (Weiss et al., 2021). The predominant ocean sampling technique involves trawls with plankton nets (typically 250\u2013330\u00a0\u03bcm), although this might under-represent the amount of microplastic fibres and particles (Athey and Erdle, 2021). Other techniques involve filtration through a range of different pore sizes, although it is noted that filtration favours the identification of smaller microplastic fractions, leading to biasing in the reporting of typical microplastic particle sizes found in fluvial and marine environments (Weiss et al., 2021). Notably, microplastic sampling has focussed on surface, or near-surface sampling, yet the wide range of particle size, shape, and density demands characterizing the depth distribution of microplastics concentration to better model transport in both fluvial (Cowger et al., 2021a) and marine (Pabortsava and Lampitt, 2020) environments.\n\n\n4.1.2\nConsiderations when sampling for microplastics in the environment\nTraditional sediment sampling techniques commonly involve materials or tools that are made from plastic, thus representing potential sources for environmental contamination and should be avoided or sampled to obtain a control sample from it (Woodall et al., 2015). For example, multicoring or piston coring devices, commonly used to sample marine sediments, typically capture sediments in an inner liner made of polyvinyl chloride, which can get damaged when used. Additionally, samples may be exposed to post-collection contamination, through contact with the air and unclean surfaces therefore environmental samples should be sought alongside the use of contamination minimisation procedures. For these reasons it is imperative that field blanks are collected in a manner that effectively represents the magnitude and variability of microplastics contamination introduced through field sampling activities (Brander et al., 2020). The high likelihood of post-sampling contamination can make it challenging to use samples for inquiry outside of plastic pollution research, but careful planning can often permit this.\n\n\n\n4.2\nLaboratory sampling, identification and classification\nSediments are made up of biotic and abiotic materials (including microplastics). In mineral sediment research, organic material is often removed from the total sediment sample using digestion procedures (Gray et al., 2010) similar to those employed on microplastic samples (Masura et al., 2015). Plastics are generally considered less stable during extraction than mineral sediments due to their low heat tolerance and sensitivity to certain acids and bases (Lusher et al., 2020), which may discolour them, hence affecting visual observation (Nuelle et al., 2014) or result in fragmentation. The possible fragmentation is important to notice as microplastic particles might change their size or shape during processing (Cole et al., 2013; Krukowski, 1988), which would lead to particle descriptions that differ from the original particle found in the environment. However, it is common to use organic matter digestion (often using a mixture of H2O2 and H2SO4) for microplastics found in sediments with high organic content before instrumental observations (Cole et al., 2013). Density separation is commonly performed in sediment research to sort sediments by density (Krukowski, 1988) similar to how microplastics (typically of lower density than mineral sediments) are separated from mineral sediments. The fine-grained silt and clay particles that remain adsorbed onto the coarser sediments are removed using dispersants such as sodium hexametaphosphate, which is also the case with microplastics as they may be trapped within the mineral sediments (Pagter et al., 2020). Particle size distribution data for mineral sediments are derived from classical techniques like wet sieving (>63\u00a0\u03bcm), in conjunction with settling-based techniques such as the pipette method (<63\u00a0\u03bcm) using Stokes' Law. The different sizes of sediments are isolated by placing the samples on a sieve-stack of different mesh sizes, and then counted under a stereozoom microscope to get abundance data. Similarly, microplastics samples are sieved into size fractions suited for different analytical techniques (i.e. ATR-FTIR vs \u03bcFTIR imaging). To obtain quantitative information on the abundance of different sediment grain sizes, instruments such as laser diffraction particle size analyser (LDPSA; range of 0.04\u20132000\u00a0\u03bcm) and rapid sediment analysers are used as this is less time-consuming and a large number of samples can be quickly processed unlike the classical techniques. These instruments have been used to study the size distribution of microplastics from commonly occurring plastic particles like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polycarbonate (PC) (Mortula et al., 2021), and personal care products (Renner et al., 2021; Kokalj et al., 2018) obtained from supermarkets. For environmental samples, these techniques are less suited since they cannot distinguish polymers from natural particles. In addition, fluorescent staining with dyes (e.g. Nile Red (Erni-Cassola et al., 2017; Maes et al., 2017)) can be used to distinguish plastic particles from mineral and organic materials in a sample. This method is mainly used for better visualization and subsequent identification of microplastics (Lv et al., 2021). As the staining process with Nile Red depends on the polarity of the plastics, some polymer types (PC, PUR, PET and PVC) and some particle shapes (fibers) are difficult to stain and might thus be overlooked (Prata et al., 2019). Furthermore, natural materials may be co-stained (Prata et al., 2019; Konde et al., 2020). Konde et al. (2020) concluded that photoluminescence spectroscopy can improve the differentiation between plastics and natural materials, while purely optical inspection of the stained samples can lead to misidentification. Fluorescent staining should therefore never be used on its own, but as an additional step to identify microplastic particles in environmental samples.\nShape analysis and observation of surface textural features are often used for sand- and silt-sized sediments. The sphericity and roundness parameters are studied under the microscope using visual estimation (Powers, 1953; Rittenhouse, 1943), and more sophisticated techniques like Fourier transform provides a two-dimensional digitisation of grain images (Lee and Osborne, 1995). The nitrogen gas adsorption method can also be applied to sand-sized mineral particles to derive three-dimensional mineral shape and surface texture (Blott et al., 2004). Advanced techniques such as automatic particle-shape image analysis for natural quartz grains can provide four parameters (solidity, convexity, highly sensitive circularity and aspect ratio), which are used to derive information on the sedimentary processes (Chmielowska et al., 2021). In the case of microplastics, shape classification of larger particles is mainly done with the help of a stereozoom microscope and categorized into foam, pellet, fibre, fragment, and film, with the measurement of their dimensions (Rochman et al., 2019). Instruments combining laser diffraction and dynamic imaging (e.g. Bettersizer S3 plus; Bettersize Instruments Ltd) can provide information on not only the particle size but also the shape of the material. However, they have not been applied in the case of microplastic studies yet. Recent studies on microplastics have used automated image analysis as a tool to study the dimensions of the plastic particles (Primpke et al., 2019; Primpke et al., 2017; Rodr\u00edguez Chialanza et al., 2018), which has helped significantly in reducing the sample processing time. To describe particle shapes with image-based methods, Hentschel and Page (2003) identified that ruggedness (derived from area and perimeter) and elongation (measured by aspect ratio) are the most critical characteristics. Further development of these techniques together with autonomisation of processing will both increase the robustness and speed of microplastic sample processing.\nThe composition of the mineral particles present in the sediments are studied using their optical mineralogy properties. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy allows a sedimentologist to obtain high-resolution images of the sedimentary particle and also its elemental composition, which aids in the study of surface textural features, and interpretation of their origin and causes. Recent studies on microplastics have also made use of this method to study the effect of environmental degradation processes on the surface texture of microplastics with respect to exposure time (Sait et al., 2021). Destructive and non-destructive techniques are applied to identify the composition of the polymers. Destructive techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry coupled with thermogravimetry (Majewsky et al., 2016) (TGA-DSC), pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Fries et al., 2013) (Pyr-GC\/MS), thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (D\u00fcmichen et al., 2017) (TED-GC\/MS), x-ray diffraction (Ariza-Tarazona et al., 2019) have been used to this aim. Some of these techniques are also applied to study the composition of organic matter (Ninnes et al., 2017) (Pyr-GC\/MS) and mineral fractions (von Eynatten et al., 2012) (XRD) in sediments. Amongst the non-destructive techniques, vibrational spectroscopic methods such as the ATR-FTIR, \u03bcFTIR and Raman spectroscopy are the most commonly used to identify the polymer composition, but also nuclear magnetic resonance (Peez et al., 2019) needs to be mentioned as a non-destructive technique. The images obtained by these spectroscopy techniques are also used to determine the 2-dimensional shape of the particles, using automated image analysis. However, limited spectral libraries for material identification are a common problem in microplastics research (Cowger et al., 2021b). Mineralogy research has created a network of labs globally who share Raman and FTIR mineral spectra (https:\/\/rruff.info\/). Pooling resources in this way has also been initiated for microplastic research (https:\/\/simple-plastics.eu\/ for IR spectra, SLoPP-E for Raman spectra (Rochman Lab, 2021)), and can be further enhanced in the future.\n\n\n\n5\nEcotoxicology\nAs with natural particles (such as sediment particles) the effects of exposure to microplastics are likely to depend on numerous factors including particle size and shape, chemical composition, and life history of the affected organism. There are drastic differences between the particulate nature of different environmental niches, ranging from relatively particle-free pelagic waters to sediment and soil. Organisms specialized to living in particle-rich environments (such as plants or sediment dwelling invertebrates), or feeding on particles (e.g. filter-feeding crustaceans and bivalves), will be adapted to do so. These organisms, which encounter and ingest non-food particles as a function of their life history (Lopez and Levinton, 1987), employ mechanisms of partition and excretion, which could ostensibly extend to ingesting and excreting microplastics (Gutow et al., 2016). On the other hand, given the ubiquity of microplastics in marine sediment (Woodall et al., 2014), it is likely that many deposit feeding species will encounter and ingest microplastics to a greater degree than pelagic organisms (Taylor et al., 2016), which may present challenges that go beyond the ingestion of natural particles alone.\nIn contrast to natural sediment particles, microplastics may contain thousands of harmful chemical contaminants, both as additives and as by-products of their breakdown under environmental conditions (Wiesinger et al., 2021). Wiesinger et al. (2021) determined that more than 10,000 substances are used in the production of plastics, inducing monomers, additives and processing aids, and that more than 2400 of those are substances of concern and potentially hazardous compounds. When plastics are lost into the environment, numerous processes will impact the physical and chemical nature of the materials. As plastics age, chemicals will leach out into the surrounding environment (Hermabessiere et al., 2017) and environmental contaminants will sorb onto the particles (Mato et al., 2001). These chemicals may leach from the microplastics following ingestion, potentially leading to more adverse effects than exposure to relatively more inert natural particles, such as sediments (Zimmermann et al., 2020). However, both microplastics and natural particles may act as vectors for chemical contaminants. Whether microplastics or their associated chemicals impart adverse effects between ingestion and excretion, and whether any effects differ significantly from those of natural particles, remains to be determined for the vast majority of organisms and environmental conditions.\n\n5.1\nInteractions with other pollutants and contaminants\nThe propensity for microplastics to act as chemical vectors has been central to many investigations, but needs to be considered in context and compared to other potential chemical fates and exposure routes. When comparing microplastics and sediments in terms of their interaction with other contaminants, most laboratory studies generally report that microplastics sorb greater or equal amounts of contaminants than soils or sediment particles (Wang and Wang, 2018; Kl\u00f6ckner et al., 2021) with few exceptions. These exceptions are associated with the adsorption of polar contaminants (Zhou et al., 2020a; Besson et al., 2020). Fig. 2\n provides a brief overview of microplastic and sediment ranking based on their adsorption capacity to contaminants in laboratory studies. The figure reveals that for sorption of hydrophobic contaminants, sediments consistently rank low compared to plastics while for metals, the reverse is the case. The interaction of any polymer with contaminants is often based on the properties of the polymer, background media or the contaminants (Alimi et al., 2018). Plastic surfaces are often produced to be smooth, hydrophobic and resistant to chemicals (Angu et al., 2014; van Oss, 2020), but these properties can change due to environmental influences such as UV radiation and freezing. Therefore, some microplastics have a relatively smooth and inert surface morphology - leading to a more hydrophobic behaviour - and other microplastics have rough and charged surfaces, which are more hydrophilic (Hossain et al., 2019). The hydrophobicity is highly dependent on the polymer type and can decrease when a particle gets wet, which is, for example, the case for PE (\u0160vor\u010d\u00edk et al., 2006; Sim\u00f5es et al., 2008). The hydrophobic nature of some microplastics (e.g. PVC, PP, PS) make them good candidates for adsorbing persistent organic pollutants in the environment and there is evidence that microplastics in sediment reduce the bioavailability of, e.g. PCBs (Verla et al., 2019), while the general hydrophilic nature of sediments will attract trace metals (Besson et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020b). The differences in hydrophilicity of plastics and sediment particles might explain why in Fig. 2, sediment particles adsorb metals easily (for example Cs, Zn, Cd) in four studies, but rank low for the three studies investigating hydrophobic contaminants (phenanthrene and triclosan). The importance of microplastics acting as vehicles for contaminant transfer in the ecosystem compared to sediments will be a function of their relative abundances in the environment (Rochman, 2016). Recent estimates show that the current abundance of plastic is significantly less than sediments or other environmental media in the aquatic system, hence, microplastics may not be significant transport vehicles for other contaminants compared to sediments (Koelmans et al., 2016; Gouin et al., 2011).\n\n\n5.2\nEffects in aquatic animals\nDespite ample evidence of microplastic uptake across a broad range of aquatic organisms (Duis and Coors, 2016), there is currently little consensus on the ecotoxicological implications, particularly at environmentally relevant concentrations. Much of the early ecotoxicology research into microplastics focused on a few aquatic model organisms, e.g. the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna, and were generally conducted using a limited number of particle types, namely polystyrene spheres (S\u00e1 et al., 2018; Wendt-Potthoff et al., 2017) with particle concentrations much higher that found in natural systems (Lenz et al., 2016). Early work addressed several issues, including physiological effects (Wright et al., 2013) and the transfer of chemicals from microplastics to various organisms (Koelmans et al., 2014). Although many studies have demonstrated adverse effects in a plethora of organisms following microplastic ingestion, most studies have neglected to contextualize the impacts of microplastics by including comparisons with other types of particles, such as naturally occurring minerals (e.g. clay and sand) or organic particles (e.g. cellulose fibres and particulate organic matter). This lack of direct comparisons with natural particles means we cannot yet conclude that the toxicological effects of microplastics extend beyond those of natural particles. Indeed, a high concentration of natural particles such as silt and sediment is a known stressor for many species (\u00d6sterling et al., 2010), and the effects of turbidity due to suspended sediment in aquatic ecosystems are generally well-understood (Henley et al., 2000).\nIn recent years, several studies have attempted to disentangle the toxicological effects of microplastics from those of natural particles, by comparing both particle types to particle-free controls. Using this approach, several adverse effects have been recorded in aquatic animals in response to microplastic exposure including reduced growth and development, reduced fecundity, increased mortality, and adverse generational effects (Sch\u00fcr et al., 2020; Scherer et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2020; Casado et al., 2013; Puranen Vasilakis, 2017). In contrast, exposure to natural particles under the same experimental conditions has been shown to have little to no effect. However, most of these studies have used D. magna as the model organism, and so the external validity of these results to other species and systems is unknown. It is also important to note that a control, such as kaolin may not be suitable for the assessment of microplastic toxicity, given its propensity for sedimentation, possibly resulting in lower bioavailability.\nIt is not yet clear if gut retention time for sediment versus microplastics is different across different taxa. For example deposit feeding benthic organisms rely on the organic fraction of ingestion sediment for their nutrition (Lopez and Levinton, 1987). Given that microplastics are ubiquitous in aquatic sediments (Woodall et al., 2014) these deposit feeders are interacting with microplastics as they feed, and many studies have documented internalization of microplastics in this type of organism (Taylor et al., 2016). Exposure to high levels of microplastics can be impactful to deposit feeders (i.e. by reducing gut activity (Wright et al., 2013)) and could result in the reduction of inorganic nutrient release (Green et al., 2016), thereby impacting sediment-based processes.\n\n\n5.3\nEffects in plants and algae\nBoth natural particles and microplastics may adversely affect plants, depending on particle properties. In the case of microplastics, exposure may affect growth and germination (Bosker et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021b), ostensibly caused by the release of chemical additives such as flame retardants and plasticizers (Hahladakis et al., 2018). Conversely, the presence of natural particles has been found to exert little to no effect on plant growth (Rozman et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2021; Kiani et al., 2021), even stimulating growth in algae in some cases (Gorokhova et al., 2020).\nA small number of studies have directly addressed the effects of microplastics versus natural particles, using aquatic plants and algae. Rozman et al. (2021) showed that irregularly shaped microplastics and Bakelite (a thermoset plastic, developed at the beginning of the 20th century) negatively affected growth in the duckweed Lemna minor, with Bakelite apparently leaching inhibiting chemicals. In contrast, natural particles did not impart any negative effects. However, Gorokhova et al. (2020) found that both microplastics and natural particles reduced growth in the unicellular alga Raphidocelis subcapitata, with the greatest inhibition occurring at the highest concentrations. Again, this variation in effect may be related to life history differences between macro- and microalgae. It is also possible that the deposition of microplastics, as with natural particles, contributes to the inhibition of plant growth (Brodersen et al., 2017).\n\n\n5.4\nEffects on microbes\nMicrobial communities have been found on microplastics and in sediment, and microbes are vital in many planetary processes, ecologically acting as producers and decomposers. It is still uncertain how benthic microbial communities that reside on these different particles differ, however there is increasing evidence that microplastics harbour microbes that are significantly different to those of surrounding sediment (reviewed by (Yang et al., 2020)). In addition, a recent study showed that microplastics altered the microbial community and nitrogen cycling process of marine sediment of a mesocosm experiment (Seeley et al., 2020). This demonstrates the close link between microplastic presence and the ecological function of sediment communities.\n\n\n5.5\nVariation in effect based on particle properties\nControlled studies suggest that the type of particle and its source may affect toxicity. Ogonowski et al. (2016) showed that secondary microplastics (cryomilled PE, irregular shapes, avg. 2.8\u00a0\u03bcm) increased mortality, reduced fecundity, and delayed reproduction in Daphnia magna, while primary microplastics (PE spheres, avg. 4\u00a0\u03bcm) and kaolin (irregular shapes, avg. 4.4\u00a0\u03bcm) imparted no significant effects. Zimmermann et al. (2020) exposed Daphnia magna to cryomilled, secondary microplastics, \u226459\u00a0\u03bcm which is small enough to be consumed by animals, and found that polyvinyl chloride (PVC) reduced reproduction, while polylactic acid (PLA) reduced survival. The authors had exposed the Daphnia to microplastics grinded from consumer products which can contain thousands of chemicals, so they included several different exposures to differentiate between chemical and particle effects: produced microplastics, microplastics that had been purified from chemical additives via methanol extractions, and the chemical extracts. Further analysis showed that the effects of PLA were caused by the physical properties of the microplastics, while the effects of PVC were chemical in nature. In contrast, Puranen Vasilakis, 2017 showed no significant effect related to PLA exposure, but negative effects in response to polystyrene were shown, ostensibly caused by the release of styrene monomers from the latter. In relation to natural particles, differences in toxicity between kaolin and diatomite have recently been shown (Scherer et al., 2020). This suggests that some natural particles, while apparently more benign than microplastics, may also exert negative effects in aquatic organisms. Again, further testing is required to determine the effect thresholds for different natural particles, as well as microplastics.\n\n\n5.6\nMeta-analysis of direct ecotoxicology comparisons between different particle types\nWe have extracted data from studies that compare the different effects of exposure to microplastics versus natural particles (Sch\u00fcr et al., 2020; Scherer et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2020; Puranen Vasilakis, 2017; Rozman et al., 2021; Gorokhova et al., 2020; Ogonowski et al., 2016), to differentiate between particle driven impacts and those inherent to microplastics. We only included studies that had a negative, particle-free control, i.e. aqueous solution to which neither sediment nor microplastic particles have been added. The forest plots in Fig. 3\n show the effects of natural particles and microplastics on growth, reproduction, and mortality\/survival of several aquatic animal and plant species. Values to the left of the line indicate negative effects (lower growth, higher mortality etc), while values to the right of the line indicate positive effects. Values at the line indicate no effect. As such, greater distance from the line represents a greater effect magnitude. The results suggest that exposure to low concentrations of microplastics or natural particles do not affect growth, reproduction, or survival in the analysed species. At higher concentrations, microplastics may exert negative effects on reproductive output and survival, while high concentrations of both microplastics and natural particles may adversely affect growth. However, given the low number of studies and the high degree of heterogeneity, the results must be interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions and recommendations\nWe have compared the particle properties, aquatic transport dynamics, environmental sampling and ecotoxicology of microplastics and natural sediments. While knowledge on natural sediments is already broadly used in some areas of microplastics research (transport behaviour, environmental sampling), other areas may benefit from the transfer of sedimentological knowledge to microplastics (particle description) or from acknowledging the differences and similarities between sediments and microplastics (numerical modelling, ecotoxicology). Based on these insights, we synthesised a number of important areas for future research (Table 3\n).\nMany studies have suggested that the paradigms used in sedimentary research can be applicable to describing the fate of microplastics, as they can be regarded as a type of sediment that behaves in similar ways, with erosion, transport and deposition depending on grain size. However, microplastics are diverse and characterized by different densities, particle sizes and shapes, as opposed to natural sediments that have successfully been generalized to be spherical and uniformly size-distributed in the past. This generalization does not seem to be suitable for microplastics due to their greater shape diversity as described above. Therefore, we need to improve and standardize our description of microplastic particles to gain insights into how particle properties influence the distribution and ecotoxicology of microplastics in the environment. Moreover, a standardized property description might allow us to determine particle origin. That is why methods for particle description in sedimentology, such as the use of shape descriptors or the principle of the cube, can be useful and should be adopted by microplastic researchers. In addition to the high particle variability of microplastics, their change over time complicates our understanding of their behaviour and predictability. Factors such as changes in particle shape through fragmentation, degradation and deformability that received little attention in the field of sediments may be essential for microplastics behaviour and require further research.\nThe classification of sediment transport into suspended and bedload transport has already been applied to microplastics research and expanded to a third class, i.e. surface transport. Especially bedload transport suffers from many open research questions, such as the conditions that lead to near-bed particle movement, the quantities of transport and particle interactions with the bed. Shifts between these transport modes that usually can be estimated by particle size and density of natural sediments are still poorly understood for microplastics and require the development of metrics that relate particle properties with transport mode.\nThe possibilities of numerical simulations of sediment transport have not yet been fully exploited for microplastic research, although basic paradigms from sediment transport modelling exist that can be of use for the growing field of microplastic modelling. Describing microplastic particle transport based on sedimentary laws provides important insights for global microplastic distribution, but lacks the consideration of the dynamic behaviour of the microplastics themselves. To differentiate the behaviour of natural and microplastic particles, we need to parameterize microplastics' physical properties, shape, surface properties, density, as well as time-dependent changes, including biofouling, aggregation, flocculation and fragmentation. In the future, numerical simulations should consider the above-mentioned findings, or emphasize the assumptions of their models more clearly.\nIn particular the role of biota in microplastic transport requires more research. While vegetation effects are well-studied for natural sediments, few studies quantify the mechanisms behind an abundance of microplastics in vegetated surfaces. Similarly, alterations of resuspension and deposition thresholds induced by biofilms and macrobenthic organisms need to be quantified. Here, our knowledge from sediment resuspension appears to be applicable and representative of microplastics behaviour. Conducting flume experiments similar to those in sedimentary research can be useful to determine threshold shear stresses for microplastic resuspension, which we urgently require to incorporate microplastics in numerical models and test hypotheses on the processes behind microplastic redistribution.\nDue to the complex nature of sediments and microplastics, existing methodologies for environmental sampling are highly varied and not immediately comparable, highlighting the need for standardized guidelines for future sediment and microplastic studies. This involves the entire process of the assessment of microplastics in environmental samples, from sampling technique, sample preparation and identification of microplastic particles. The selection of an adequate sampling technique is a vital step in environmental analysis and the overview here, including notes on the suitability of current methods for microplastic sampling, can be used as a useful tool in creating standardised guidelines. Special attention should be paid to the prevailing modes of microplastic transport in order to carry out representative measurements.\nMuch work has been done to understand the impacts of microplastics on organisms, mechanisms of interactions and uptake, physical damage, and important factors driving toxicity. This research allows us to begin to understand the environmental risk posed by these complex particles. However, we are still grappling to fully comprehend the relative importance of the polymers themselves, the plastic-associated chemicals and the physical nature of the particles. Experimental design and choice of particle exposures is therefore important, natural particles should be included in future toxicity studies, whether the work aims to understand chemical vector effects or particle effects, so that we might gain perspective and better understand relative risk.\nIn our review, we highlight that the profound knowledge regarding particle description, transport dynamics, sampling methods and ecotoxicology of sediments can be of great value for microplastics research and has already offered valuable concepts to describe microplastics behaviour and transport. It would be foolhardy not to take advantage of the opportunities that arise from the legacy of sediment research to guide future microplastic research. Nevertheless, caution is advised, as the transferability of sedimentary methods and principles must first be assessed and, if necessary, adapted to microplastics in order to be applied effectively.\n\n\nFunding\nThe work of KW is supported by the Investment Plan for strengthening the Technical Sciences at Wageningen University.

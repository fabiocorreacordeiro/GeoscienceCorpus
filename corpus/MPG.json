Middle Jurassic Realgrunnen Subgroup, deposited during a major change in the structural evolution of the basin which greatly influenced its development and distribution. The effects are evident in one of the petroleum provinces in the SW Barents Sea, the Hoop Area. Due to the condensed nature of the succession, the tectonostratigraphic evolution has been enigmatic.\n                  We use a range of different methods and dataset, including high-resolution P-Cable seismic to determine the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the succession. Results are important for exploration and production in the Hoop Area and beyond, but also for a broader understanding of how ultra-condensed successions might evolve during long periods of non-deposition and short bursts of deposition.\n                  Seven major phases of deposition and non-deposition\/erosion are defined. Stage 1 represents fluvio-deltaic deposition in the Fruholmen Formation (Norian), followed by Stage 2 with significant truncation and non-deposition, lasting up to 35 million years. Deposition resumed with the shallow marine to fluvial Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations (Pliensbachian to Bajocian), which both encapsule long periods of erosion and non-deposition (stage 3\u20136). Stage 7 is represented by transgression and shelf deposition in the Fuglen Formation (Bathonian).\n                  The change from a high-accommodation setting with continuous and relatively high rate of accumulation in the Triassic, to a low-accommodation setting with episodic deposition and extensive sediment cannibalization in the Jurassic, resulted in cleaner sandstones with better reservoir properties. The low-accommodation setting also enabled coarse-graded detritus from hinterlands in Fennoscandia to prograde into distal part of the basin and more amalgamation of the sands during the Jurassic. Adversely, the low accommodation setting also caused a fragmented pattern of deposition and preservation that needs to be carefully considered in subsurface datasets, often with limited resolution.\n               ","1":"\n                  The Illizi-Ghadames basin (located in Libya, southern Algeria and Tunisia), is one of the most prolific hydrocarbon regions in North Africa, and even though it has been intensely studied, the potential thermal effects of Cenozoic magmatic activity on the petroleum system are still debated.\n                  Here, the thermal history in a sector of the basin is investigated through petrographic observations and modelling of the diagenetic evolution of the Devonian sandstone reservoir. The thermal modelling scenario that best fits the petrographic and petrophysical observed data shows that overheating of the studied part of the basin occurred during the late Cenozoic, Miocene to Quaternary magmatic cycle. This implies that after the early drop-in porosity and permeability, mainly due to compaction during the late Paleozoic, there was another significant decrease in reservoir rocks pore space during the late Cenozoic due to rapid quartz cement precipitation likely triggered by magmatic overheating.\n               ","2":"\n                  Quantitatively assessing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) cycling in methane-rich marine sediments is essential for understanding the contributions of different carbon sources to the global carbon cycle.

Model results show that methane contributed to 92.75% and 79.95% of DIC sources through anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) versus only 7.25% and 12.90% by organic matter via organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR) and methanogenesis at both sites. However, the methane sources vary between the two sites. External thermogenic methane that is decoupled from contemporaneous organic matter deposition drives the AOM at CL27A. A combination of upwardly diffusing external biogenic methane and internal methane derived from in situ methanogenesis drives the AOM at CL44. Internal methane flux from depth reveals the deep methanogenic zone influences the DIC cycling in the shallow sediments at CL44. It is accompanied by the upward diffusive DIC flux that can be identified by the \u03b413C-DIC data when modeling, which contributes to the remaining 7.15% of the DIC source. Neglecting this DIC source that is set as a fixed value at the lower boundary will misunderstand the DIC cycling in the shallow sediments. This study identified and highlighted the influence of external thermogenic methane and the methanogenic zone on the DIC cycling in marine sediments, and demonstrated assessing DIC cycling accurately in methane-rich marine sediments is important to estimate its contribution to oceanic carbon cycling.\n               ","3":"\n                  Kerogen is the most abundant form of naturally occurring organic matter in organic-rich shale, and it can affect the macro-mechanical characteristics of shale reservoirs during the whole shale thermal evolution process. However, the magnitude and mechanism of this effect are not clear. Here, a relatively low-maturity kerogen isolated from an organic-rich shale was used to prepare a series of kerogen samples of different maturities in an artificial pyrolysis experiment. Raman spectroscopy and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to determine changes in the chemical structures of the kerogen samples, and in situ nanoindentation analysis was employed to characterize the evolution of their mechanical properties. Raman spectral analyses indicate that Raman band separation (RBS) is very sensitive to thermal maturity, increasing with maturity and displaying a strong linear correlation with mechanical properties of kerogen such as hardness and Young's modulus. Based on the solid-state 13C NMR and nanoindentation analysis, the evolution of kerogen mechanical properties with maturity can be divided into two stages: oil-generation wet-gas stage (corresponding to 0.7%\u20132.5% EasyRo), and dry-gas stage (2.5%\u20134.5% EasyRo). In the former, kerogen exhibits a soft nature with relatively low hardness and Young's modulus, possibly attributable to its relatively large proportion of aliphatic carbon and long-chain alkanes. When maturity reaches the gas stage, kerogen becomes increasingly stiff due to the markedly increased proportion of aromatic and bridgehead carbon. Considering the strong positive correlation between mechanical parameters and chemical-structure parameters (RBS, and aromatic and bridgehead carbon ratios) of kerogen during the overall thermal evolution process, we suggest that the stiffening of kerogen may result from the decreasing content of aliphatic chains and increasing aromatic carbon.

However, reservoir characterization and geological conditions for storing CO2 in gas-charged sand layers below the BMHSZ have not been well studied.\n                  We investigate deep-water shallow-buried strata in the Shenhu area by analyzing and interpreting 3D seismic and well logs data. We present the W07\u2013W23 gas hydrate reservoir that consists of two Lower Pleistocene sand zones: gas hydrate and free gas accumulation within levee facies in the upper zone and free gas accumulation within channel facies in the lower zone.

The concentration of H2S (>5.0%) is relatively high, and the \u03b434S values of the H2S are significantly higher than those of the Permian source rock kerogen, suggesting a TSR origin for the H2S. The \u03b413C values of the methane and ethane do not increase as the gas souring index (H2S\/(H2S+\u2211Cn)) increases, and the \u03b434S values of the H2S are significantly lower than those of the solid bitumen, suggesting mainly liquid hydrocarbon dominated-TSR. The \u03b434S values of the solid bitumen and H2S in the Puguang gas field in the eastern platform are significantly lower than those in the Yuanba gas field in the western platform, and the sulfates for the TSR were most likely derived from the Early and Late T1f evaporative seawater, respectively. The sulfates required for TSR were most likely enriched during dolomitization based on the positive relationship between the H2S concentrations and the thickness of the dolostone reservoirs. The H2S distributions were mainly controlled by the sulfate distributions and the paleo-oil accumulations. The edges of the eastern and western platforms in the Kaijiang-Liangping trough, which were favorable for dolomitization and paleo-oil accumulations, are the most likely H2S-enriched areas in the Sichuan Basin.\n               ","6":"\n                  Gas hydrate contains abundant methane gas, which is considered to be a promising energy resource to mitigate the influence of climate change in the future.

We constructed 4-D hydrate-bearing models covering a wide hydrate saturation range based on high-resolution digital images obtained by Synchrotron Radiation X-Rays Computed Tomography (SRXCT). We analysed the elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of these models by the static Finite Element Method (FEM). The results demonstrated that the dominant hydrate morphology transits from pore-filling to load-bearing when hydrate saturation increases. At low hydrate saturations, the hydrate formed around some gas bubbles blocks local pore space. Therefore a great enhancement in compressional wave velocity was observed at low hydrate saturations. While the shear wave velocity was less affected due to the presence of thin water films. Based on the simulated results, an empirical model was developed to compute the compressional and shear wave velocities considering the free gas phase. The comparison with some experimental measurements validated the applicability of the model.\n               ","7":"\n                  Diamondoids and thermally stable aromatic components are the major components that form in source rocks at post mature stage (gas window). To date, the linkage among these two type components and gaseous hydrocarbons has been rarely documented in processes of generation and expulsion from source rocks and accumulation to oil\/gas reservoirs. To investigate this issue, quantitative GC, GC-MS and GC-IRMS analyses were performed on twenty-nine concdensate samples from gas fields in the Kuqa Depression of the Tarim Basin, northwestern China. These samples have higher concentrations of 4- + 3-methyldiamantanes (4+3MD) in the range of 42\u20132757\u00a0ppm and moderate concentrations of C29 \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1 20R sterane in the range of 2.4\u2013179\u00a0ppm, demonstrating that the reservoirs for these samples were initially charged by normal oils at maturities within oil generative window, and then by gas from deep post mature source rocks. Concentrations of 4+3MD in liquid components that were carried by the later gas charges can be up to 10000\u00a0ppm or even higher, suggesting that diamondoids were generated in higher amounts with higher expulsion efficiency from the deep post mature source rocks. Diamondoid ratios, such as MAI, DMAI-1, DMAI-2, TMAI-1, TMAI-2, MDI, EAI, DMDI-1 and DMAI-2 vary in wide ranges and have close positive correlations between each other and with dryness ratios (C1\/\u03a3C1-4) of gaseous hydrocarbons, demonstrating that these ratios are effective maturity parameters and diamondoids for the studied samples mainly formed within a wide maturity range at gas window (%Ro 1.5\u20133.5). Concentrations of 4 + 3MD have positive correlations with diamondoid maturity ratios, dryness ratios (C1\/\u03a3C1-4) of gaseous hydrocarbons and concentrations of thermally stable aromatic components, such as biphenyl (BP), naphthalene (Na), phenanthrene (Phen), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and chrysene (Ch), demonstrating that diamondoids and thermally stable aromatic components as well as gaseous hydrocarbons were consistently generated and expelled in increasing amounts from the deep post mature source rocks with increasing maturities, and then migrated along faults to sallower reservoirs where the initially charged oils remain uncracked at present.\n               ","8":"\n                  Determination of the in situ hydrocarbon content and occurrence characteristics of shale oil reservoirs is crucial for reserve prediction and efficient development. Although many scholars have studied the fluid saturation of conventional coring shale using solvent and thermal extraction methods, with time consuming and only volumes or mass of oil and water were given, which could not reveal the occurrence characteristics of oil and water in samples. This study proposes a two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) T1\u2013T2 mapping method to systematically assess the in situ water and oil content, distribution, and their evaporative loss laws of preserved shales. Sixty preserved shales with different maturities were selected from the first member of the Qingshankou Formation in the northern Songliao Basin, China. Each preserved sample was divided into two parts and analyzed using a high-frequency (22\u00a0MHz) NMR and Dean\u2013Stark extraction respectively. Furthermore, a time-elapsed NMR T1\u2013T2 mapping was performed on a preserved shale core sample after varying the exposure times in an open environment. Results show that T1\u2013T2 mapping can be used to determine the porosity, water and oil contents, and saturations of preserved shales. Oil content measured using T1\u2013T2 mapping was consistent with that obtained by Dean\u2013Stark extraction, with a correlation coefficient (R2) as high as 90% when crude oils of varying maturities were used for NMR calibration.The T1\/T2 of oil inpreserved shale showed a negative trend with maturity, and the T2 of oil was often higher than that of water, indicating oil is enriched in the relative macropores. After exposing the preserved shale to open air for 150\u2013200\u00a0h, 1) the total loss ratio of oil and water was approximately 80%; 2)the fluid evaporation loss rate follows the orders: oil\u00a0>\u00a0water and fluids in larger pores\u00a0>\u00a0smaller pores; 3)the free oil content decreased by approximately 92%, whereas the absorbed oil content varied slightly. As a nondestructive, rapid, and minimal sample preparation method, 2D NMR can efficiently assess both fluids content and distribution of a core sample in only 5\u00a0min, thus displaying its great advantages and applications for preserved shales with fast fluid evaporation to determine the in situ fluid content.\n               ","9":"\n                  We present the first detailed intra-basin correlation of Upper Miocene deposits in the Austrian part of the Vienna Basin (VB) integrating the most important hydrocarbon fields. Herein, we use a high resolution dataset by separating the Pannonian (= Tortonian) stack into 20 lithostratigraphic units, which allow calculating regional differences in sedimentation rates over a time span of \u223c1.6\u00a0Ma. During this time span we recognize an initial phase of high lateral variability in thicknesses, reflecting the influence of paleo-topography on deposition during the early Pannonian. The relief difference of about 300\u00a0m was rapidly filled by lake marls and delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube. Subsequently, lateral variability in sediment thicknesses declined strongly around 11.0\u00a0Ma. At that point the relief was largely sealed, and subsidence became the controlling factor. Our data document a shift of high subsidence rates from the southern VB to the northern VB into three steps, initiated by increased activity of the Steinberg Fault around 10.5\u201310.4\u00a0Ma. Sedimentation rates have been declining during the early Pannonian but reveal a strong pulse in subsidence during the middle Pannonian. The still high sedimentation rates during the late Pannonian indicate persisting extensional tectonics in the VB throughout the Late Miocene and question the prevailing tectonic model of a compressional regime for this time. The lack of uppermost Pannonian deposits in most wells documents a post-Pannonian erosion of about 400\u00a0m in large parts of the VB.\n               ","10":"\n                  Strata from the Ryukyu Islands provide an important source of data for the study of the provenance patterns, sedimentary and tectonic evolution of the East China Sea Shelf Basin (ECSSB). This research uses petrologic, mineralogical and geochronological analysis to investigate the Upper Cretaceous\u2013Miocene strata of the central and southern Ryukyu Islands. The results show that both these locations experienced a shift in their sediment provenance and characteristics over time. In central Ryukyu, the Upper Cretaceous sediments show multiple peaks for zircon ages from the Mesozoic to the Archean. However, the Eocene sediments indicate a single source, because the zircon ages have a narrow distribution focused on 110\u00a0Ma, during the Late Yanshanian orogeny. This probably indicates that the provenance shifted, from mixed deposition of near-source Permian\u2013Early Jurassic basement and long-distance transportation of old material from the North China Block and Korea in the Late Cretaceous, to limited near-source in situ deposition in the Eocene. This change could be the result of blocking of sediment transport, by an uplift that developed at the edge of the continental margin. In southern Ryukyu, the Eocene sedimentary rock was mainly from Mesozoic sources, while the Miocene sedimentary rock has multiple peaks for zircon ages. These areas may have experienced a single provenance source of Mesozoic island arc magmatic rocks in the Eocene, and then received more Proterozoic and Archean continental crustal material from the South China Block to the west and ECSSB to the north. This change indicates an expansion of the provenance area, due to the post-rifting subsidence after the expansion of south ECSSB and South China Sea.\n               ","11":"\n                  In the northern North Sea, the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay (KC) and its equivalents in the Norwegian sector (i.e., Mandal, Tau, and Draupne) are the most prolific source rocks. These source rock units are known to record both lateral and vertical heterogeneity in organofacies with increasing terrigenous organic inputs near highs and basin flanks. Existing interpretations rely predominantly on Rock-Eval data, but only a few authors validate their geochemical interpretations with maceral assessments. In this study, Upper Jurassic source rocks from fourteen wells in the northern North Sea were analysed for both organic petrography and geochemistry. A potential correlation between the maceral compositions and Rock-Eval, total organic carbon (TOC), and stable carbon isotopes (saturate and aromatic fractions) of source rock extracts was established. This correlation suggests that carbon isotopes mirror the organofacies, and inferred redox conditions during sedimentation, described for the studied source rocks.\n                  Stable carbon isotopes of the saturate and aromatic fractions for 152 oils distributed across the Norwegian North Sea were compared to biomarker compounds sensitive to precursor organic material and oxygen abundance in the sedimentary environment. A correlation consistent with that observed between stable carbon isotopes and organofacies documented for the investigated source rocks is also observable in the oil dataset. Hence, the stable carbon isotope composition of the oils in the North Sea dataset appears to carry information related to the bulk organofacies and redox conditions prevailing during the sedimentation of their source. Oils often reflect the compositional attributes of their parental sources more efficiently than a single, or a set of rock extracts. Therefore, the stable carbon isotopes of migrated oils provide a means of inferring gross organofacies and redox conditions within different source rock kitchens in the study area.\n               ","12":"\n                  Research on the diagenesis of continental sandstone reservoirs can provide scientific guidance for the prediction of reservoir sweet spots. The low permeable-interbedded thin and thick sandstone reservoirs of the Cretaceous Quantou Formation's Quan 3 Member in the Fuxin Uplift, Songliao Basin, were used as an example in this work to investigate the diagenesis of continental tight sandstone and its influence on reservoir quality. A large number of thin section, scanning electron microscopy, granularity, X-ray diffraction, and petrophysical property measurements were used to study the petrological characteristics and diagenesis. The reservoir space evolution mode of continental sandstones in this area was constructed by combining diagenesis sequences and the evolution of petrophysical properties of the Quan 3 Member. The results show that the compositional maturity of the sandstone reservoirs of the Quan 3 Member is relatively low and their lithologies are mainly lithic feldspar sandstone and feldspar lithic sandstone, followed by lithic arkose sandstone, feldspathic litharenite and a small amount of lithic sandstone. The average particle size of the target sandstones is 0.11\u00a0mm, and the fine sandstone to coarse siltstone are favorable reservoirs. The studied sandstone reservoirs have undergone intense diagenetic transformations, including compaction (pressure solution), cementation, dissolution, and metasomatism. Moreover, the complex diagenetic environment changes in the Quan 3 Member include early alkaline-acidic\u2192mid-alkaline\u2192late acidic. The shallow sandstones are in the meso-diagenetic A1 stage; when the burial depth exceeds 800\u00a0m, they enter the meso-diagenetic A2 stage; and when the burial depth exceeds 1600\u00a0m, they enter the meso-diagenetic B stage. It was found that diagenesis has significant control over the quality of continental sandstone reservoirs. Compaction is the primary factor controlling the quality of the target reservoir. It controls the differences in the petrophysical properties of the reservoirs in the eastern and western regions; that is, the physical properties of the Quan 3 Member in the east are higher than those in the west. Cementation and dissolution are secondary controlling factors of reservoir quality that control the differences in reservoir petrophysical properties in the northern and southern regions; that is, the physical properties of the Quan 3 Member in the north are better than those in the south. The most favorable reservoirs of the Quan 3 Member are developed in the Fuyu Oilfield, which is distributed in the southeast region and develops fine sandstones of branch channels and meandering river point sand bars of delta plains that suffer the least compaction and the strongest dissolution. This study may provide crucial clues for predicting the sweet spot reservoirs of the Quan 3 Member in the study area.

Located in the northern margin of the Tethys, the Amu Darya Basin (ADB) is well known for its large, indeed giant, gas fields. However, there has been surprisingly little research on the mechanisms of hydrocarbon accumulation in the basin. This paper investigates the accumulation history of the Samandepe Gas Field, a large condensate gas field in the Chardzhou step-fault zone in the northeastern ADB. Trap evolution in the basin is analyzed, the oil and gas sources and hydrocarbon charging periods are determined, and the process of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation explored to establish the relationship between hydrocarbon accumulation and the tectonic evolution of the Tethys. Geophysical logging, organic geochemistry, fluid inclusion analysis, basin modeling are used for analysis. The results show that hydrocarbon accumulation in the Samandepe Gas Field occurred in two stages. First, a lithological \u2018large trap\u2019 formed in a barrier reef belt in the Late Cretaceous Santonian, before the present anticline structure of the gas field formed. This trap was filled with oil generated in Upper Jurassic marine source rocks, forming a lithological paleo-oil reservoir. In the second stage, at the end of the Paleogene, the large trap was reformed as structural traps with reef-shoal reservoirs. Natural gas generated from coal-measure source rocks in Middle and Lower Jurassic strata migrated along basement faults, filling the traps. Excess natural gas displaced the oil, some of which dissolved in the gas, forming \u2018gas washing\u2019-type secondary condensate oil and creating a structural condensate oil-bearing field. The inherited paleo-uplift in the step-fault zone is crucial to large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation in the ADB.\n               ","14":"\n                  Solid bitumen has been acknowledged as an important source of overmature shale gas. However, the gas generation potential, chemical signatures and carbon isotopic compositions of natural gas derived from solid bitumen in an overmature hydrocarbon system are not well-understood with respect to various geological conditions. In this study, a relatively low-maturity solid bitumen from Cambrian reservoirs in the northwest Sichuan Basin was pyrolyzed in both closed and stepwise, semi-open systems. In the closed system, methane generated in the overmature thermal stage is dominated by the secondary cracking of wet gas and cumulative methane carbon isotopic values that are 4.4\u2030\u201314.8\u2030 lighter than the carbon isotope composition of the original solid bitumen. In semi-open systems, the gas is predominantly generated from residual solid bitumen and has wetness (i.e., C2\u2013C5\/C1\u2013C5 by volume) values of generally less than 1%. At the same thermal maturity levels, the carbon isotope composition of methane in various semi-open systems is 4.4\u2030\u201310.0\u2030 heavier than those in the closed system and may also be isotopically heavier than the carbon isotope value of the original solid bitumen. The present study also illustrates that the calculated gas yields and methane carbon isotopes within a certain thermal maturity range in the closed system cannot be compared with those from residual solid bitumen as measured in the corresponding semi-open systems. This highlights the need to conduct specific semi-open pyrolysis experiments to investigate the late gas generation potential and geochemical signatures of natural gas from solid bitumen when the geological system is not a closed system. By comparing the above-mentioned results with the geochemical characteristics of Wufeng-Longmaxi shale gas from the Changning and Jiaoshiba gas fields of the Sichuan Basin, southwest China, it is suggested that the shale gas examined in this study is most likely generated in semi-open systems rather than in a closed system. In other words, the early-generated gas has been expelled from the shales, leaving the late-generated gas from residual solid bitumen and\/or kerogen as the main gas source in the present hydrocarbon system.\n               ","15":"\n                  Significant volumes of coals can be preserved in fluvio-lacustrine rift basins but prediction of occurrence and geometry within a sequence-stratigraphic framework is always a challenge.

In this study, the sedimentary facies, sequence stratigraphy, paleogeography, and coal accumulation characteristics in the Huhehu Sag are analyzed. Data used includes boreholes, geophysical well logs and seismic profiles. The coal-bearing strata are mainly composed of conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, and coals. Alluvial fan, braided fluvial, fan delta, braided fluvial delta and lacustrine depositional systems are identified. Coal seams were mainly formed in lacustrine and delta depositional systems. Six third-order sequences were subdivided according to sequence boundaries represented by regional unconformities, basal surfaces of incised valley fills, facies-reversal surfaces, and abrupt color changes related to the base level changes. Sequence 1 corresponds to the Tongbomiao Formation formed in the early syn-rift phase, Sequence 2 corresponds to the Nantun Formation formed in the syn-rift climax phase, Sequence 3 and 4 span the Damoguaihe Formation, with Sequence 3 formed in the syn-rift climax phase and Sequence 4 formed in the late syn-rift phase, and Sequence 5 and 6 span the Yimin Formation which were formed in the post-rift stage.

Sequence 1 to Sequence 2, Sequence 3 to Sequence 4 and Sequence 5 to Sequence 6 are of progradational patterns, while Sequence 2 to Sequence 3 and Sequence 4 to Sequence 5 display retrogradational features. From Sequence 1 to Sequence 4, the syn-rift led to the thickening of strata as well as the coal seams towards the eastern side of the sag. In Sequence 5 and 6, post-rift thermal sagging caused the wide distribution of the strata with the depositional centers as well as the thick coals being distributed in the central belt of the sag. Coals were mainly developed in the transgressive systems tract (TST) and highstand systems tract (HST) of Sequences 4 and 5. The favorable paleogeographic units for thick coal accumulations were mainly littoral-sublittoral lacustrine and delta. The Huhehu Sag is interpreted as an overfilled basin, we further divided the overfilled basin into three subtype basins by accommodation space, including the low, moderate, and high accommodation overfilled basins. In the low accommodation overfilled basin, the relatively thick coals were developed near the maximum flooding surface, while in the moderate accommodation overfilled basin, the relatively thick coals were developed in the lower-middle part of TST and the middle part of HST.

However, the sources of these petroleum occurrences are still in dispute, because of the severe biodegradation, strong thermal alteration, and multiple tectonic movements. At present, such uncertainty in the potential source rock systems has hindered oil and gas exploration in the study areas. In this study, methods including catalytic hydropyrolysis and trace elements analysis were introduced into the oil-source correlation study, to avoid the influence of biodegradation and\/or thermal alteration.

By contrast, in the southern part, the Eocene-late Oligocene sediments display a dominant age population ranging from 100\u00a0Ma to 300\u00a0Ma, which implies that the sediments were mainly eroded from nearby Shenhu Uplift and Hainan Island. The heavy mineral data also record such spatial differences in provenance. However, during the early Miocene, the northern and southern parts show similar detrital zircon age patterns with multiple clusters at \u223c245\u00a0Ma, \u223c450\u00a0Ma, \u223c850\u00a0Ma, 970\u2013980\u00a0Ma, 1825\u20131845\u00a0Ma, and \u223c2500\u00a0Ma, indicating that the Miocene sediments across the whole basin were mainly provided by the Pearl River system. The increase of Paleozoic and Precambrian zircons in the lower Miocene sediments suggests a profound provenance shift from multiple nearby sources to the South China Block via the Pearl River between Oligocene and Miocene in the western PRMB, and its timing is posterior to other regions of the PRMB. Finally, four-stage source-to-sink evolution for the PRMB is proposed, showing that sediment provenance in the PRMB is controlled by regional tectonic movement, drainage evolution, and basin architecture. This study suggests that the small-scale drainage system Nanduhe River sourced by Yunkai Massif contributed significantly to the PRMB between Eocene and Oligocene, and highlights its complex processes of provenance evolution that are relevant to the evolution of marginal sea basins globally.\n               ","18":"\n                  The Miocene, syn-rift mixed siliciclastic-carbonate strata has been a long sought-after reservoir objective in the Red Sea rift basins. Despite being viable prospects, their depositional architecture, mechanisms of siliciclastics and carbonate mixing, and fundamental controls on their reservoir quality remained elusive and enigmatic. In this study, we used sedimentological, petrographical and outcrop permeametry measurements to investigate the stratigraphic record and reservoir quality of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposits. The latter are preserved at the transition between non-marine Al-Wajh Formation and marine carbonates of the Musayr Formation in one of the Red sea rift basins, NW Saudi Arabia. Three major facies associations were identified using detailed logging facies analysis, including siliciclastic-rich, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate and carbonate-rich facies association. These facies associations, represent a basinward transition from dominantly non-marine alluvial fans, braided streams and shallow-water delta into an open marine carbonate ramp. The permeability of siliciclastic facies is orders of magnitude higher (average permeability\u00a0=\u00a01884 md) than mixed siliciclastic-carbonate (average permeability\u00a0=\u00a0109 md) and carbonate (average permeability\u00a0=\u00a046 md) facies. Likewise, siliciclastic facies have higher porosity (average porosity\u00a0=\u00a017%) compared to mixed (average porosity\u00a0=\u00a07%), and carbonate (average porosity\u00a0=\u00a015%) deposits. Petrographic analysis suggests that permeability and porosity variation within these facies is due to textural and diagenetic differences. Outcrop based permeability correlation separated the studied deposits into reservoir (excellent or good) and non-reservoir (baffles or barriers) elements. The relatively thick (5\u201310\u00a0m) and laterally continuous (hundreds of meters) siliciclastic deposits form excellent and good reservoir compared to usually thinner (1\u20132\u00a0m) mixed siliciclastic-carbonate and carbonate beds, which may act as baffles and barriers. This reservoir-seal configuration highlights the potential of stratigraphic trap formation in analogous settings in the subsurface, where non-marine siliciclastic deposits show lateral transition to marine carbonates.\n               ","19":"\n                  The Ordovician carbonate fault-controlled reservoir in the Shunnan area is substantially different from the typical karst reservoir closely related to an unconformity. The development of fault-controlled reservoirs is controlled by the deep and large strike-slip fault in the Middle Caledonian period. The characteristics, diagenesis types, diagenetic fluid evolution characteristics, fluid-rock interactions, and reservoir response of fault-controlled reservoirs were investigated systematically by analyzing 3D seismic, logging, and drilling core data. Production data, reservoir petrology, and chemical filling geochemistry were also used. The formation and evolution of fault-controlled reservoirs are affected by the coupling of the structure, lithofacies, and fluid. The dolomitization in the quasi-syngenetic period in the early stage of Episode I in the Middle Caledonian provided the material basis for the development of fault-controlled reservoirs. The Mg-rich high-salinity thermal fluid in the late Caledonian and the Early Hercynian provided a constructive transformation for the development of fault-controlled reservoirs. In contrast, the transformation of reservoirs by the Si-rich magmatic thermal fluid in the late Hercynian was mainly destructive, and the action range of the deep thermal fluid was strongly controlled by strike-slip fault zones. The releasing bend and superimposed parts of different structural styles in the fault zone have high activity intensity. These are areas where dissolution and transformation of the fluid occur preferentially. Dolomite is often more conducive to the development of fault fracture zones and promotes the dissolution and transformation of the deep thermal fluid. Therefore, the strike-slip fault cutting through the basement causes the hydrothermal fluid to enter the fault, dissolving carbonate minerals and forming a hydrothermal-modified fault-controlled reservoir composed of fractures, dissolution pores, and dolomite intercrystalline pores. The results provide a new approach and direction for the study of different types of deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","20":"\n                  Identifying the timing, geometry, mechanism and multiphase reactivation of the inherited structures on the structural style of the fold-and-thrust belt is important for hydrocarbon exploration and production.\n                  In this work, we present a multidisciplinary approach including field data, seismic profiles, well data analyses, isopach maps, 2D balanced cross-sections construction, and 2D sequential restoration. Such an approach is applied to decipher the multiphase deformation of the NNE-SSW trending deep-seated Kharg-Mish Fault (KMF) that controlled the tectono-sedimentary evolution and structural style of the Gachsaran Anticline (South Dezful Embayment - SDE). Kinematic analysis of the KMF reveals two different mechanisms from normal to reverse faulting (positive inversion) since the Cenomanian. From the Late Cretaceous-Late Miocene, the sedimentary cover thickness \u223c2500\u00a0m decreases along-strike of the Gachsaran Anticline towards the east, over the KMF, due to regional erosion and pinch-out.\n                  The eastern sector of the Gachsaran Anticline shows an angular and smaller wavelength fold in the levels of Asmari and Sarvak formations due to the efficient local middle d\u00e9collements of the Kazhdumi and Pabdeh formations. Different amounts of shortening, 19.4% for the western and 16.7% for the eastern sector, and fore-thrust propagation developed a tear fault that accommodated differential deformation. Long-term structural evolution and strain localization in the eastern sector of the Gachsaran Anticline over the KMF produced dense fracturing. Our study suggests that mechanism and timing of deformation along the pre-existing basement structures are important in structural evolution of the sedimentary cover, oil migration and accumulation in such a hydrocarbon province.\n               ","21":"\n                  The fold-and-thrust belts developed in the southern margin of the Junggar Basin in China can be divided into different segments and oblique rows in the strike and dip direction respectively. The internal structural patterns and linkage types of different sub-segments usually affect the oil and gas accumulation. In this work, we study on the propagation and linkages of the structural patterns involved in the fold-and-thrust belts due to the differential compression by the Discrete element method (DEM). Two simulations are configured to use four velocity modules, which can move with different velocity at the same time: (i) the homogenous module filled with brittle simulating sediment is used to investigate the structural response to a velocity difference and (ii) the module with ductile detachment at the front of each module is used to test how the weak layer affects deformation. The results are illustrated by topography of the simulations, such as cross sections perpendicular and parallel to the shortening direction, forward and lateral displacements seen from the top view, and sections of the velocity field. The results show that (i) resistance from adjacent modules promotes the development of back-thrusts in faster modules, and drag from faster moving module hinders nucleation in slower modules, and (ii) two types of transfer zones caused by shear stress appear in the piedmont region and in front of the fold belts. The detachment simulation produces results are similar to the western segment of the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, which can explain the several rows of anticlines that appear oblique in the plane. These results are useful to analyze the formation process of the oil and gas trap developed in the similar compressional area.\n               ","22":"\n                  During the Albian age, siliciclastic input in the Arabian carbonate-dominated shelf formed important petroleum system elements. Hence, the Albian Burgan-Kazhdumi succession hosts world-class sandstone reservoirs in some Middle East oil fields. Moreover, stratigraphic traps are possible due to changes in facies and structural dips. Accordingly, we used process-based forward stratigraphy modeling as a powerful tool to predict Burgan-Kazhdumi units and de-risking new exploration prospects. A 3D stratigraphic model was constructed in this study for the first time by integrating multi-disciplines and multi-scales of seismic and well data from several countries. The model (324\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0264\u00a0km, 4\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0km grid size) encompasses NW of the Persian Gulf, Kuwait, south Iraq and SW of Iran and is vertically divided into three units based on Albian regional third-order sequences.\n                  Results indicated that the lower unit, unit-1, contains onlapping aggradational-retrogradational stacking compounds, high sand bodies thickness and distribution as well as good reservoir quality. This unit was deposited on a tide-dominated delta system. Gradually, with rising sea level, progradational fine-grain marine sedimentation dominated in units 2 and 3. Hence, intra-formational seal facies formed in the proximal and organic-rich facies in the distal intra-shelf areas. The gentle topography of the basin floor seems responsible for the lack of turbidity lobes. The sand bodies of up-dip arches such as Khafji-Norooz and Kharg-Mish highs and pinched out in fine-grained facies provide a significant potential for stratigraphic traps.\n                  The model sensitivity analysis showed eustasy, and water-driven diffusion coefficient (Kw) has the most critical impact on the clastic sedimentation of unit-1 and unit-3. Furthermore, tectonic events have the most significant sedimentation effect in unit-2 sedimentation.\n                  The findings of this study can help for better understanding of a more precise regional sequence stratigraphic and stratigraphic architecture of the Albian succession of the study area.

The sedimentological characteristics and tectonic evolution of the formation have been extensively studied by previous researchers. However, the impact of diagenetic alterations on porosity evolution of the sandstone is poorly understood. This study employed a multi-technique approach, including thin-section petrography, SEM, XRD, and cathodoluminescence analyses to investigate the role of framework composition, primary depositional characteristics, and diagenetic alterations on porosity evolution of the sandstones. The results of the study indicate that the Bima Sandstone has a present-day intergranular porosity ranging from 0 to 25.9%, averaging 5.8%. Diagenetic alterations, including mechanical and chemical compaction and quartz cementation, have significantly modified the porosity of the sandstones more than the primary depositional features (grain size and sorting). Porosity reduction was mainly due to mechanical compaction (av. 32.1%) than cementation (av. 7.4%). Quartz overgrowths (up to 15%) are the most abundant cement in the sandstones, formed primarily due to lack of grain-coating clays. The main eogenetic alterations related to shallow burial include dissolution and kaolinitization of feldspars and, to some extent, mechanical infiltration of smectitic clays, which formed largely discontinuous clay coatings and pore-filling clays. Mesogenetic alterations related to deep-burial include the formation of quartz overgrowths, transformation of kaolinite and smectite into illite, and pervasive albitization of both plagioclase and K-feldspar, which is exclusively associated with the deepest, Lower Bima Sandstone Member, and has significantly reduced the secondary porosity in the sandstones. Telogenetic alterations related to uplift, mainly include dissolution and kaolinitization of unstable feldspars, which has significantly increased the present-day, secondary porosity of the sandstones to up to 15%. Pore-filling clays (chlorite, illite, and kaolinite) have had a small impact on the intergranular porosity of the sandstones, mainly because of their low volume. The study provides insights into how diagenesis can significantly affect the reservoir porosity of the sandstones and could also assist in reducing the risk of exploration of the fluvial reservoir in the basin and elsewhere.\n               ","24":"\n                  The northern South China Sea (SCS) continental margin has a very complex geological history within a multiplate convergent setting and has experienced multiphase tectonic movements, during which the largest significant petroliferous basin, the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB), developed. Along the northern boundary of the PRMB, a prominent wide ENE-striking intraplate deformation zone, the Littoral Fault Zone (LFZ), stretches from west to east and is considered to be the major fault structure that formed during the spreading of the SCS and rifting of the northern continental margin. However, a lack of direct constraints on stratigraphic records and fault intersections due to difficulties with offshore geophysical exploration has resulted in uncertainty about the nature of the LFZ, especially the location, geometry and deep\u2013shallow structural coupling, which are still unclear. In this paper, we use newly collected enhanced images provided by 2D long-offset multichannel seismic reflection profiles across the LFZ Pearl River Mouth (PRM) segment to analyse the deep structural and stratigraphic elements along the LFZ. Combining these data with previous findings, we attempt to advance the understanding of the NE\u2013ENE-striking LFZ nature, evolutionary history and controlling effect on the tectonic and sedimentary processes that led to the formation of the PRMB. The results of this work shed new light on the geodynamic processes surrounding the PRMB. We suggest that the LFZ acted as a northern boundary fault with a three-phase transition over time. The first phase of fault activity initiated as a low-angle basement decollement (phase 1), followed by high-angle SE-dipping normal faults, which were mostly inherited from basement faults and reactivated during the Zhuqiong movement (phase 2). Above these two structures, the faults are characterized by strike-slip faulting, which occurred in the Oligocene (phase 3). The overall geometry of the LFZ shows right-step dextral features in the PRM segment that are obviously segmented by NW\u2013WNW-trending faults. Our results highlight the significant role of this ENE-striking fault system in the basin sub-basin (sag) formation on the northern continental margin of the SCS.\n               ","25":"\n                  Silica diagenesis is critical to reservoir properties of shale, including porosity and rock mechanical properties, thus exerting a significant effect on shale gas production, but the role it plays on porosity evolution of deeply-buried shale remains unclear. In order to address this issue, a suite of deep gas shale samples (5910\u20135965\u00a0m depth) recovered from the Lower Paleozoic Wufeng-Longmaxi formations (WF-LMX) of the Sichuan Basin was selected to study silica diagenesis in these deposits and its effect on porosity evolution by the use of optical, SEM and SEM-CL observations, geochemical analysis, and low-pressure gas adsorption experiments. TOC of the WF-LMX shale sample suite that was altered to the thermally overmature stage ranges from 0.63 to 6.70\u00a0wt% (average\u00a0=\u00a03.26\u00a0wt%). Quartz hosted by the studied shale samples is present as six forms, including detrital quartz, quartz overgrowth, siliceous skeletal fragments, aggregates of amorphous to euhedral microquartz, silica nanospheres, and matrix-dispersed microquartz. Silica involved in the diagenetic alteration of the WF-LMX samples appears to have been chiefly sourced from the dissolution of siliceous skeletal fragments (mostly radiolarians) and secondarily from the transformation of clay minerals and alteration of detrital K-feldspar. Detrital quartz played a minimal role in porosity preservation, whereas authigenic quartz influenced porosity evolution in two ways. Siliceous skeletal fragments, aggregates of microquartz, silica nanospheres, and early diagenetic matrix-dispersed microquartz formed a rigid framework that shielded organic pores from compaction. However, quartz overgrowth and the precipitation of late stage diagenetic microquartz reduced porosity by filling voids. We estimate that a moderate content of authigenic quartz (Sixs\u00a0=\u00a010\u201330%) is optimal for the development and preservation of porosity (especially organic porosity). Organic pores, the dominant and pervasive pore type in the deep shale gas play, appear to have been best preserved in samples containing less than 5.5\u00a0wt% TOC. It is noteworthy, however, that some of the larger organic pores in samples containing >5.5\u00a0wt% TOC have collapsed in response to compaction. It is apparent, then, that organic porosity of the WF-LMX deep shale has been largely preserved showing great potential for shale gas exploration.\n               ","26":"\n                  Fine-grained sediment deposition is widely distributed in lacustrine and marine facies and significant for petroleum geology. However, the causes of fine-grained sediment deposition remain controversial. In this study, we examine the cause of fine-grained sedimentation in the Neogene saline lacustrine Qaidam Basin, and propose a new insight into the sedimentary process for fine-grained sediments. Various sedimentary structures identified from the fine-grained sediments such as erosional structures with lag deposits, hummocky cross-stratification (HCS)-like structures, asymmetrical ripples, or sandy ball-and-pillow structures, are generated by winter storms. These winter storms are related to the winter winds that cause eolian sedimentation in Asia. Abundant detrital material may be rapidly transported into lakes by winter storms, favoring extensive terrigenous detrital deposition in the lacustrine basin, hardly controlled by the division of sedimentary facies and topographical differentiation. The genetic features and shallow-water origin with wind and fluvial\u2013lacustrine source-to-sink processes, may be the main reason for the poor hydrocarbon potential of the Neogene fine-grained sediments in the Qaidam Basin.\n               ","27":"\n                  Several giant oilfileds have been discovered during recent exploration in the Ordovician carbonates in zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions, Tarim Basin, China. These oilfields are deeply buried (>7000\u00a0m), and most productive wells are found adjacent to fault zones, suggesting faults may play a crucial role in reservoir development. Here, we use petrographic, microanalytical and geochemical techniques on different stages of void-filling calcite cements to decipher the tectonic-fluid evolution history. Vugs are generally occluded by V1 and V2 calcite cements, which precipitated from marine and burial diagenetic fluids. Two major episodes of fluid invasion are evident in each set of fractures from Middle Ordovician strike-slip faults (F1) to Late Devonian to the Permian strike-slip faults (F2). The sub-horizontal fracture-filling F1 calcite cements show the involvement of near-surface marine to marine-evolved brines, given that \u03b418Ocarb, restored \u03b418Ow values and rare earth element and yttrium (REY) profiles of F1-1 calcite cements are comparable to Ordovician seawater. The F1-2 calcite cements are characterized by negative \u03b418Ocarb, positive restored \u03b418Ow, and apparent Ce positive anomalies. The sub-vertical fracture-filling ferroan F2-1 calcite cements with fluorescence show the highest restored T(\u039447) (up to 125\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (up to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW), and an enrichment in MREE, which is consistent with an origin from hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal brines. The subsequent F2-2 calcite cements may have precipitated during the Late Permian from mixing of basinal brines and deeply circulated meteoric water, as suggested by significantly negative \u03b418Ocarb values, cooler restored T(\u039447), negative restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), and flat REY patterns. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of calcite cements are similar to coeval seawater.

Although the greatest part of the Pirabas Formation is overlain by the Barreiras Formation and the post-Barreiras deposits, the outcrops provide the opportunity to investigate these Neogene successions that are the onshore equivalent of the large offshore basins (e.g. Amap\u00e1 Formation: Foz do Amazonas and Ilha de Santana Formation: Par\u00e1-Maranh\u00e3o) of the margin. The latter are deemed to represent an important target for reservoir models. Aiming to thoroughly describe the Pirabas Formation deposits and provide a quantitative and simple approach to analysing the outcropping successions, this study examines seven different successions and a quarry using palaeontological and petrographical methods. Similar to the modern Brazilian equatorial margin, the siliciclastic fraction in the Pirabas Formation rocks decreases as the distance from the coast increases, whereas the bioclastic material is found in greater amounts offshore. However, while the carbonate production close to the Amazon River mouth currently occurs hundreds of kilometres offshore, the carbonate factories in coastal along the Pirabas platform are also located in coastal waters. This indicates that the terrigenous input over the carbonate rocks was still lower than that found at present. The combining analysis of the skeletal and foraminiferal assemblages enabled a separation of protected embayments (characterised by seagrass-related assemblages), exposed areas (characterised by bioclastic shoals) and mangrove forests (characterised by dark fine-grained sediments).

Insufficient understanding of oil origin and migration direction, and lack of characterizing oil differential accumulation distribution patterns in Wushi sag greatly restrict further hydrocarbon exploration. In this study, oil-source rock genetic relationships and migration directions were analyzed in detail by combining geochemical analysis of 45 source rock samples, 23 crude oil samples, 12 oil sandstone samples, and basin modeling results. The geochemical data show there is distinguishable heterogeneity in Liushagang Formation (Fm) source rock in Wushi sag, which is divided into two types. The first type (including the Member (Mbr) 23 and Mbr 3 of Liushagang Fm source rocks) was deposited in a weak reducing to suboxic and fresh to brackish water environment with a predominance of aquatic algal plankton input. The second type (including the Mbr 1 and Mbr 21 of Liushagang Fm source rocks) was deposited in a suboxic and fresh to brackish water environment with mixed inputs of aquatic algal plankton and terrestrial higher plants. Three groups of crude oils (A, B, and C) are identified using their physical properties and biomarker data. The group A oil is characterized by a higher abundance of oleanane, lower abundance of C30 4-methylsterane, higher values of Pr\/Ph, and lighter \u03b4\n                     13C values, and is mainly derived from the Mbr 21 of Liushagang Fm source rock.

Both groups of oils are sourced from the Mbr 23 of Liushagang Fm source rock, and their differences in geochemical characteristics indicate the lateral heterogeneity of source rock. Oil migration directions are determined by combining maturity parameters, pyrrolic nitrogen compounds, and also basin modeling results. The preferential oil migration directions in Wushi sag are from the central to the northeast and south of the sag. The accumulation distribution of different groups of oils is mainly controlled by the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of Mbr 2 of Liushagang Fm source rock.\n               ","30":"\n                  The nature of the dolomitization fluids and the diagenetic alterations on carbonate Mg\/Ca ratios in Cambrian series-2 to Miaolingian strata in Central Uplift Belt, Tarim Basin are interpreted on the basis of petrography, geochemistry (trace elements, halogens, REEs, O\u2013C\u2013Sr isotopes) and fluid inclusion microthermometry. Based on petrographic examination, two types of less stoichiometric dolomites: dolomicrites (DM), very fine-to fine-crystalline planar-e(s) dolomite (D1) formed at near-surface to shallow-burial settings, and two types of more stochiometric dolomites (fine-to medium-crystalline planar-e(s) dolomite (D2) and medium-to coarse-crystalline.\n                  nonplanar-a dolomite (D3)) formed at deep-burial setting are identified. Medium-to coarse-crystalline, nonplanar-a saddle dolomite cement (DC), and early-stage calcite cement (ESCAL) and later-stage calcite cement (LSCAL) are identified. The DM, D1, D2, and D3 samples display positive Cerium anomalies (\u03b4Ce) and negative Europium anomalies (\u03b4Eu), and the DC display positive \u03b4Ce and positive \u03b4Eu. They show micritic-bladed and blocky calcite-like REE patterns, suggesting their dolomitizing fluids inherited the seawater or seawater-like REE signatures of their precursor carbonate materials at the time of crystal growth. No correlations exist between \u03b413C, \u03b418O, 87Sr\/86Sr, Mg\/Ca, and Mn\/Sr which were tools used to evaluate the diagenetic history of the carbonates, coupled with the high Mg\/Ca ratios (0.64\u20130.85), Mn\/Sr ratios, and more depleted \u03b418O, \u03b413C values of D2, D3, and DC. This suggests that the dolomites were altered by high-temperatures or their isotopic difference may be the result of equilibrium isotopic fractionation. The increasing trend in Cl\/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Mg), I\/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Mg), and Br\/(Ca\u00a0+\u00a0Mg) ratios in the D2, D3, and DC with dolomite content >50\u00a0wt% can be explained by the presence of evaporite (salt) derived from seawater or sedimentary pore waters as fluid interaction with sedimentary materials in the studied strata. The comparable isotopic (\u03b418O, \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr) values between DM, D1, D2, D3, DC, and coeval Early Paleozoic seawater value, coupled with the relatively high homogenization temperature (Th) and salinity levels in D2, D3, and DC, indicates that their diagenetic fluids were derived from radiogenic 87Sr-enrich coeval seawater with hypersaline signatures in deep-burial settings. The dolomitization model shows that the precipitation of dolomicrites was by evaporative seepage-reflux dolomitization at near-surface burial settings. Evaporative seawater dolomitization supported by 87Sr\/86Sr, \u03b413C values and calculated water oxygen isotope ratio was probably responsible for the D1 during shallow-burial, and D2 and D3 with irregular overgrowth rims were formed during deep-burial dolomitization. The average range of the Th values of DC is 148.2\u2013193.4\u00a0\u00b0C; mostly overlapping with the estimated ambient temperature (65\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C, at a depth >4000\u00a0m) for the studied strata, indicates that the growth of DC in fractures may have resulted from upward and laterally squeezed higher-temperature saline-enriched basinal fluids conveyed by geothermal convective-advective fluid flows or squeegee fluid flows at depth resulting in geothermal dolomitization.\n               ","31":"\n                  Diagenesis is a very important factor to determine the quality of clastic reservoirs, especially in tight sandstone reservoirs. The tight reservoir of Triassic Yanchang Formation in southwestern Ordos Basin is the foremost hydrocarbon exploration target. The shallow-water lacustrine delta developed in Chang 8 reservoir of the study area is distributed in digitate shape, which are mainly composed of distributary channel, continuous mouth bar and together with natural levee above. The typical tight reservoir of Chang 8 member experienced a complex diagenetic evolution process, but the relationship among diagenetic alteration, deposits and lithofacies, as well as their control and influence on reservoir quality is still unclear. In this study, casting thin section, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and backscatter scanning electron microscope (BSE) combined with energy spectrum analysis, together with stable isotope analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and homogenization temperature test of fluid inclusions are used to analyze the reservoir characteristics including petrology, lithofacies, history and intensity of diagenesis. The control and influence of these characteristics on ultimate reservoir quality of digitate shallow-water lacustrine deltas are further evaluated. The results show that four lithofacies can be identified (namely, \u201ci\u201d, \u201cii\u201d, \u201ciii\u201d, \u201civ\u201d) with the decrease of grain size and increase of ductile components in the tight sandstones of digitate shallow-water lacustrine delta, respectively corresponding to preferential development positions in the deposits. There are similarities and differences on the diagenetic processes among various lithofacies. The strong mechanical compaction after burial primarily decrease the original pore space in all lithofacies, and the largest loss of pore space occurs in lithofacies iv sandstones (siltstone with wavy bedding). The chlorite is mainly in the morphology of pore-lining, but coating and rosette-like chlorite are rare. The ability to resist compaction in sandstones of lithofacies i and lithofacies ii is enhanced due to the moderate development of pore-lining chlorite, thus retaining partial pore space. Carbonate cements are abundant in relatively coarser-grained sandstones close to the sandstone-mudstone interface, and the occurrence of these cements is closely related to the adjacent mudstone, indicating that Fe and Mg ions necessary for carbonate cementation are most likely from adjacent mudstone where ions are released by mechanical compaction and subsequent hydrocarbon generation pressurization during the burial process. Weak carbonate cementation occasionally occurs at the architectural bounding surface far away from mudstone, which probably related to the transformation of clay minerals. Five typical diagenetic evolution patterns in digitate shallow-water lacustrine deltaic reservoir are summarized by considering the diagenetic processes with deposits and lithofacies. From pattern I to pattern V, the corresponding reservoir quality gradually deteriorates. The results in this study are of great help to deepen the understanding of diagenetic alteration process and reservoir heterogeneity of tight sandstones, and provide theoretical basis for exploration and sustainable development of similar lacustrine shallow-water lacustrine delta reservoirs, especially for bar fingers in shallow-water deltas.\n               ","32":"\n                  Calcareous nannofossil distribution, environmental magnetism, and geochemical data provide stratigraphic evidence concerning the paleoceanographic changes across the lower\/middle Albian and the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1b (OAE1b, Kilian Level) at South Atlantic Ocean. In this study, we analyzed samples from the sedimentary records at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 364, Kwanza Basin, Angola. This section is associated with the initial phases of evolution of the South Atlantic Ocean, characterized by the deposition of extensive evaporite layers under restricted marine conditions, which were preserved in many sedimentary basins of the Brazilian and African continental margins. The open marine conditions that followed this period are recorded in the sequences of limestones interbedded with organic matter-rich black shales. In the Kwanza Basin, Site 364 contains a well-preserved sedimentary record of these post-salt sequences. In this study, we address the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary records at Site 364 from a paleoceanographic perspective, investigating the influence of OAE1b and local paleoenvironmental conditions. Our data analysis indicates a progressive reduction in hypersaline conditions during the lower\/middle Albian. In these conditions, five paleoceanographic intervals (PIs) were described, which show different evidence of dysoxia\/anoxia and salinity fluctuations, euxinic intervals, surface-water temperature changes, and hydrothermal activity signals, as well as possible ocean acidification episodes. These paleoceanographic conditions at Site 364 are associated with a stratified thermocline composed of warm surface-water from the North Atlantic (Western Tethys) and cool deep-water incursions from the Austral Atlantic, which strongly affected the composition of the calcareous nannofossil assemblages. We propose that the lower\/middle Albian paleogeographic and paleoceanographic conditions observed in the Kwanza Basin were likely related not only to local events linked to the early development of the South Atlantic, but also to the OAE1b - Kilian Level recognized in several basins from around the world.\n               ","33":"\n                  We present an overview of the crustal architecture of the continental margins of the oceanic Algerian Basin in the westernmost Mediterranean Sea. During the Cenozoic, and with a variable oblique convergence between the African and Eurasian plates, the Western Mediterranean Sea has experienced thinning and extension behind a tight orogenic arc formed by the Betics, Rif, and Tell Cordilleras. This study is focused on the structural style affecting the Messinian salt layer, which is mostly restricted to the deep domains of the Algerian Basin, where it is floored by a thin oceanic crust of probable Miocene age.\n                  Using deep-penetrating seismic profiles and wells from offshore western Algeria to southeastern Spain, we have analyzed the crustal structures affecting the domains close to the oceanic-continent transition on the three margins of the western Algerian Basin. Since the Early Miocene, active shortening in the Tell-Atlas domain has accommodated most of the plate convergence in the basin, whereas the Alboran margin in the west and the Iberian margin in the north experienced eastward and southward crustal extension and thinning, respectively, accompanied by volcanism. The Algerian margin in the south shows incipient thrusting of African continental crust over oceanic crust. This shortening occurred since at least the Late Miocene, also promoting decoupling and contraction of the deep, sub-horizontal Messinian salt layer. The salt exhibits diapir squeezing and suprasalt folding, whereas the presalt sequence preserves partially-inverted half-grabens. Salt tectonic processes along the northern and western margins of the Western Mediterranean Basin show contrasting structural styles formed by narrow extensional and transtensional domains with gentle salt anticlines.\n                  This region shows therefore a somewhat unusual salt-tectonic style, departing from the gravity-driven model typical of continental margins that contain an initial continuous, gently-dipping salt layer. In the Algerian Basin, salt is mostly restricted to deep water domain floored by oceanic crust, so it does not participate in significant gravity-driven deformation. Instead, Messinian salt and the suprasalt sequences underwent significant shortening along the southern margin, simultaneous with thick-skinned extension involving the Messinian evaporites in the northern and eastern margins.\n               ","34":"\n                  The Hangjinqi area is a significant gas exploration area from the northern Ordos Basin, an important petroliferous basin in China. Although a considerable amount of achievements has been made in the natural gas exploration field, the controversy about the hydrocarbon generation characteristics of source rocks has raged unabated for ten years. In addition, few studies have systematically investigated hydrocarbon expulsion potential in the Hangjinqi area.\n                  In this paper, we adopted a series of new approaches to assess the hydrocarbon generation and expulsion potential of source rocks in Hangjinqi. Specifically, we analyzed the rock pyrolysis, kerogen composition, and biomarker data and applied Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in the field of deep learning to determine organic matter abundance, type, maturity and depositional environment. Then, two techniques, the hydrocarbon generation kinetics method and the hydrocarbon generation potential method, were implemented to obtain both the hydrocarbon generation and expulsion quantity. The results reveal that the new technique CNN is suitable for TOC prediction, and the performance is improved largely compared to traditional methods, e.g., Back Propagation neural network (BP) and \u25b3log R. Rock pyrolysis data, kerogen macerals and biomarker data reveal that the source rocks are gas-prone and dominated by type \u2162. By the integrating hydrocarbon generation potential method and hydrocarbon generation kinetics method, the hydrocarbon generation quantity of the study area is 20.35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012m3. The results of the hydrocarbon potential method indicate that about 23.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108t and 0.74\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108t hydrocarbons were expulsed from coal and mudstone, respectively. According to comprehensive analysis, the hydrocarbon generation and expulsion quantities in the Hangjinqi area are extensive, indicating good prospects for natural gas exploration. These findings have significant implications for the understanding of natural gas resources potential and the distribution of favorable natural gas areas.\n               ","35":"\n                  The Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate field expeditions in 2007 (UBGH1) and 2010 (UBGH2) sought to assess the Basin's gas hydrate resource potential. Coring operations in both expeditions recovered evidence of gas hydrate, primarily as fracture-filling (or vein type) morphologies in mainly silt-sized, fine-grained sediment, but also as pore-occupying hydrate in the coarser-grained layers of interbedded sand and fine-grained systems. A commonality across many of these occurrences is the presence of diatoms in the fine-grained sediment. Here we tested fine-grained sediment (median grain size <12.5\u00a0\u03bcm) associated with hydrate occurrences at four UBGH2 sites (UBGH2-2-2, UBGH2-3, UBGH2-6 and UBGH2-11) to investigate potential impacts of diatoms on efforts to extract methane from hydrate, or to tap hydrocarbon reservoirs beneath hydrate-bearing sediment. Two key considerations are: the extent to which diatoms control sediment mechanical properties, and the extent to which pore-water freshening, which occurs as gas hydrate breaks down during resource extraction, alters the diatom control on sediment mechanical properties. We conducted experiments to measure sediment index properties, sedimentation behavior and compressibility to address these considerations. We relied on scanning electron microscope (SEM) imagery and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to characterize the sediment mineralogy. Our high-level findings are that at the \u223c20\u201345% (by volume) diatom concentrations observed at these UBGH2 sites, sediment compressibility increases with diatom content, but diatoms only appear to increase porosity and permeability at the highest diatom concentration (\u223c45%). Our measurements suggest in situ compression indices of 0.35\u20130.55 and permeabilities on the order of 0.01milliDarcies (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221217\u00a0m2) can be anticipated at these sites. Importantly, these properties are not expected to vary significantly upon pore water freshening that accompanies gas hydrate dissociation during production.\n               ","36":"\n                  Extensive studies on methane seeps have facilitated the exploration of potential gas hydrates and have revealed biogeochemical processes on the seafloor. In this study, a short core, GG00, was collected from the Shenhu area, South China Sea. By combining various geochemical and mineralogical methods\u2014including planktonic foraminiferal AMS14C dating, as well as their carbon and oxygen isotopes, chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) content and \u03b434S values, and hand-picked pyrite and other minerals, we identified a methane seeps that has been stable since the end of the Last Glacial Period. Extremely negative values of \u03b434S for CRS (as low as \u221249.7\u2030) indicated that only organoclastic sulfate reduction and its coupled sulfur intermediate disproportionation were present in the shallow sediments (from 0 to 209 cmbsf). Conversely, the increasing TS and Mo content and the progressively more positive \u03b434S values (up to \u221234.76\u2030) of the CRS indicated enhanced sulfate reduction coupled with the anaerobic oxidation of methane (SR-AOM) in deeper sediments (between 209 and 370 cmbsf). In addition, a large number of hypautomorphic-euhedral elemental sulfur (ES) microcrystals was found at 237 cmbsf using scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy identified the upper edge of the sulfate\u2013methane transition zone (SMTZ), which was close to the position that was determined from other data (e.g., major and trace elements as well as CRS and its \u03b434S value). The construction of a stratigraphic framework based on planktonic foraminiferal AMS14C dating and carbon and oxygen isotopes, combined with the large number of framboid pyrites consisting of cubic microcrystals found further below the SMTZ, suggests that this SMTZ has been relatively stable since the end of the Last Glacial Period. In addition, discrepancies in the aggregation morphology of cubic pyrite at different intervals are indicative of variations in Fe and S supply and growth space. Therefore, this study demonstrates the significance of detailed geochemical and mineralogical signatures in revealing the correlation between methane seep and climate.\n               ","37":"\n                  The clay mineral transformation of deeply buried mudstones is closely related to the mudstone microstructure, petrophysical properties, and pore fluid pressure (pore pressure). The influence of the burial history on the microstructure and compaction behavior of mudstones has been the focus of recent research. In this study, the mineral composition, mudstone microfabric and petrophysical properties of Mesozoic overpressured mudstones in the central Junggar Basin were analyzed to explore the influence of clay mineral diagenesis on compaction processes and overpressure responses in diagenetically altered mudstones. The clay minerals of these Mesozoic mudstones are mainly composed of mixed smectite\/illite layers (I\/S) and illite with small amounts of kaolinite and chlorite, but they do not contain discrete smectite. The Mesozoic mudstone underwent clay mineral diagenesis, the smectite in I\/S transformed to illite at depths of 4000\u20134800\u00a0m (temperatures of 90\u2013105\u00a0\u00b0C), and the I\/S changed from the R0 type to the R3 type. The recrystallization and growth of clay minerals continued with increasing stress with depth, leading to the substantial realignment of clay particles observed at the microscale. The combination of the preferential alignment of clay particles and precipitation of authigenic cements caused significant decreases in the porosity of the mudstone. The results of this study support the viewpoint that the effective stress continues to work in diagenetically altered mudstones, although porosity loss is enhanced by clay fabric destabilization caused by clay mineral transformation. The top depth of smectite-to-illite transformations is consistent with the top of the overpressure, indicating that overpressure occurs simultaneously with clay diagenesis in diagenetically altered mudstones. The decrease in porosity and increase in density of mudstone caused by clay diagenesis changes the overpressure logging response to a certain extent and affects the accuracy of the pressure prediction results. The sonic transit time-density cross plot can be used to effectively distinguish the compaction stage and the cause of overpressure in diagenetically altered mudstones. Clay mineral diagenesis cannot be ignored in pore pressure analysis and pressure prediction in deeply buried mudstones. This research is of great importance for deepening the theory of mudstone compaction and has practical significance for pore pressure prediction in deeply buried layers.\n               ","38":"\n                  The Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in eastern Australia is one of the most productive complex aquifers on Earth, covering a large portion of the continent. Yet stratigraphic correlation within and among constituent basins of the GAB remain poorly constrained. This has significant implications for resource estimation and management. In this study and for the first time, palynostratigraphic and zircon geochronologic data are integrated from the Lower Jurassic Precipice Sandstone and Evergreen Formation in the Surat Basin\u2013a component of the GAB. The goal was to better constrain the depositional ages as a starting point for calibrating stratigraphy across the GAB. The results showed that the Precipice Sandstone and Evergreen Formation are highly diachronous, as are their sequence stratigraphic subdivisions. We provisionally revise the stratigraphic framework based on the integration of age information to show that the \u201clower\u201d Precipice Sandstone (lowstand systems tract) ranges from Hettangian to Pliensbachian, the \u201cupper\u201d Precipice Sandstone (transgressive systems tract) extends from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, the Evergreen Formation varies from Pliensbachian to Aalenian within which the Boxvale Sandstone varies from Pliensbachian to Toarcian and the Westgrove Ironstone member ranges from Pliensbachian to Aalenian. Additionally, the data allow us to provisionally assign the APJ1 to APJ2 palynozone boundary to \u223c190\u00a0Ma, the APJ3.2 to APJ3.3 boundary to \u223c180\u00a0Ma, and to constrain the APJ2.2.2 palynozone to span 184.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\u00a0Ma.

The Precambrian strata in the northwest margin of the Tarim Basin (abbreviated as the northwest Tarim) are well exposed, which play a key role for understanding the tectonic evolution of Neoproterozoic. The northwest Tarim underwent the transformation that tectonic setting changed from convergence to expansion in the Neoproterozoic, and finally formed a continental rift until 572\u00a0Ma. During this period, thick layer of black mudstone was deposited, which probably was the important petroleum source rock. The TOC of Sinian mudstones is between 0.32 and 1.25%, with an average value of 0.53%. The average of rock pyrolysis parameters (S1+S2) is 0.17\u00a0mg\/g, Ro is between 1.61% and 2.52%, and the average of chloroform asphalt \"A\" is 0.0076%. These geochemical characteristics indicate that the source rocks are now highly mature. The carbon isotopes of kerogen are between \u221227.2\u2030 and \u221230.2\u2030 and biomarkers show that algae and bacteria are the main source input, therefore, the Sinian source rock mainly contains marine type I kerogen from a single source. The above data show that the Sinian source rock is a set of effective source rocks. The tectonic evolution of northwest Tarim was reconstructed based on the age characteristics of detrital zircons, and it indicated that the Sinian source rocks were controlled by continental rift deepening and large-scale transgression. Combined with seismic reflection characteristics, the distribution of Sinian source rocks are shown, which provides an important basis for Precambrian oil and gas exploration.\n               ","40":"\n                  This study examines sealed fractures in core samples from the Paleocene organic-rich lacustrine shales of the Gaoyou Depression, Subei Basin, China, using a multi-pronged approach to elucidate the interplay between fracture propagation and fluid circulation in shaly successions. Based on petrography, geochemistry, and geochronology of fracture-filling minerals, four generations of vein emplacement (denoted Types A-D) were identified. These were attributed to successive episodes of burial diagenesis, tectonism, and uplift occurring at different phases of basin evolution. These vein generations were then inserted into the temporal-spatial framework derived from basin modeling, leading to a reconstruction of the fracture diagenesis history in the Funing shales. Two of the vein generations contain evidence for two phases of oil migration marked by two types of oil inclusions with different fluorescence.\n                  It has been shown that the studied lacustrine shales were deposited at ca. 60.2\u201358.0\u00a0Ma. The earliest vein generation, represented by antitaxial beef calcite veins sub-perpendicular to shale bedding, propagated in incompletely consolidated shales within a regional thrust regime related to the Wubao Movement. The vein nucleation during a short-lived burial following initial deposition was also evidenced by the presence of monoliquid inclusions in the veins and calcite LA-ICP-MS U\u2013Pb age (57.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0Ma). Tectonic compressive stress together with overpressures arising from horizontal and vertical disequilibrium compaction were interpreted as being responsible for this fracturing episode. The second vein generation is bedding-parallel, oil inclusion-rich stretching calcite veins with a crack-seal texture, formed concurrently with kerogen maturation and early oil generation at moderate burial depths. The vein crack-seal fills containing yellow fluorescing oil inclusions provide evidence for episodic oil expulsion in response to cyclic rises and drops in pore pressure during the oil window. Bedding-parallel beef calcite veins characterized by antitaxial growth represent the next vein generation, emplaced during the maximum burial period (ca. 41.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma). The vein fibers have tracked the horizontal displacement of the wall rocks, likely related to lateral shortening before or at the initiation of Late Eocene basin inversion. The first three vein generations were generated in a relative closed fluid system, with vein fill sourced locally. Host-rock carbonate components and\/or earlier diagenetic carbonates were dissolved and then mobilized into these veins. By contrast, the last vein generation with blocky calcite and barite cementation is associated with input of externally derived hydrothermal fluids. The evidence comes from abnormally high fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature (Th) and salinity data, as well as the fact that Ba and sulfate were sourced from the underlying evaporite layers rather than local shales. We thus infer that cross-stratal faulting during the uplift related to the Sanduo Movement resulted in the opening of initial hydraulically closed fluid system. This episode of tectonically-driven hydrothermal circulation from deeper locations in the basin into the Funing shales led to the mixing of oil-bearing pore fluids with exotic basinal hot brines. This also accounts for the presence of abundant blue-green fluorescing oil inclusions and significantly elevated fluid salinity. Overall, this study emphasizes that during basin evolution, differences in tectonic settings and the diagenetic boundary conditions under which veins formed results in different fracturing mechanisms and associated fluid-flow regimes in shale sequences, with consequent effects on vein attributes and mineralization.\n               ","41":"\n                  The present paper investigates the oil migration and lineament distribution in fault zones within a sedimentary basin, showcasing the results from an integrated use of geochemical, and remote sensing data along the Fazenda Bel\u00e9m Fault Zone (FBFZ) in the Potiguar Basin, Brazilian Equatorial Margin. Lineaments were detected from a LiDAR digital elevation model data set using the quantitative method of morphology recognition based on horizontal and vertical curvature calculation and mapping. The polynomial regression-based spatial distribution of 20S\/(20S\u00a0+\u00a020R) C29 steranes is successfully used in oils from offshore and onshore reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin, tracing field-scale oil migration direction. These multidisciplinary analyses revealed that the oil initially migrated from an offshore area along the NE-oriented fault zone, and then parts moved along the branches of this zone to finally reach the areas of the onshore reservoirs. In addition, NE-oriented lineaments enhanced the near-surface fluid circulation, while they commonly correspond to the topographic features and fault zones. Anisotropy tensors and slip- and dilation tendency calculated from the lineament map also indicate that the geometric complexity of the lineament pattern is influenced by present-day and partitioned stress fields in the Potiguar Basin. The integration of remote-sensing and geochemistry analyses at the FBFZ area proved to be effective in approaching the tectonic aspects of a fault zone in a petroleum basin, as well as in investigating the field-scale migration of oil along the fracture corridor in a fault zone.\n               ","42":"\n                  This work reconstructs the evolution of a source-to-sink system in a transpressional setting from compositional changes within its deep-water clastic offshoots. Field-based clast counts on 10 conglomerate beds of three transects, combined with petrographical and mineralogical (XRD) analyses on 14 samples, have been used to integrate the already-existing large dataset developed during more than 60 years of study on the Como Conglomerate (the base of the Gonfolite Lombarda Group, Chattian to Aquitanian \u2013 Northern Italy). The results shed a new light on the terranes involved in the production of sediments and further constrain the evolution of the fluvial drainage in response to the Cenozoic Adria indentation during the post-collisional phases of Alpine orogeny. In particular, it has been possible to track-back the steps during which paleorivers were connected, and later disconnected, with the basin due to the Oligo-Miocene activity of the right-lateral Periadriatic Fault System (PFS). During its transpressive movement, accommodating the Adria westward indentation, the PFS cumulated a total displacement increasing from ca. 20\u00a0km to the west, up to ca. 60\u00a0km, to the east. The results of this study also constrain the post-depositional kinematics of the clastic wedge, which was progressively rotated clockwise and thrust to its present-day position, onto the Southalpine Mesozoic sequence. This model represents a fundamental step forward in the comprehension of how tectonic indentation interacts with surface source-to-sink systems, and demonstrates that tectonic induced connections\/disconnections of fluvial systems are as fundamental as exhumation processes in the transfer of sediments from source to sink areas.\n               ","43":"\n                  Subsidence is a potentially important factor influencing the evolution of carbonate platforms. Yet, few studies have been carried out on the quantitative reconstruction of subsidence history of carbonate platforms in the South China Sea. Using paleo-water depth constraints from core XK-1, drilled in the Xisha Islands, northern South China Sea, the tectonic and total subsidence history of Xisha Islands during the Quaternary is quantitatively reconstructed in this study. Slow tectonic subsidence between 1.945 and 0.988\u00a0Ma was related with magmatic intrusion beneath the Xisha Islands, while the relatively high tectonic subsidence rate between 0.988 and 0.781\u00a0Ma and the subsequent gradual decline in tectonic subsidence rate between 0.781 and 0.07\u00a0Ma were linked to the thermal cooling process. A rapid tectonic uplifting process after 0.07\u00a0Ma occurred as a result of compression and volcano eruption. Total subsidence rate showed an increase from the stage of 1.945\u20130.988\u00a0Ma to the stage of 0.988\u20130.781\u00a0Ma, and a gradual decline during the stage of 0.781\u20130.07\u00a0Ma. After 0.07\u00a0Ma, there was a rapid uplifting in response to the tectonic movement. The high eustatic sea level and intermediate total subsidence rate from 1.945 to 1.0\u00a0Ma caused the domination of bank deposits on the Xisha carbonate platform. From 0.988 to 0.65\u00a0Ma, the long-term eustatic sea-level lowering and the relatively high total subsidence rate favored the production of thick reef units. By contrast, the low eustatic sea level and the slow total subsidence between 0.65 and 0.42\u00a0Ma forced the accommodation space to be limited, resulting in formation of thin reef-bank deposits and occurrence of exposure horizons. During the stage of slow subsidence, the high eustatic sea level around 0.4\u00a0Ma allowed the last presence of thick reef unit in the Quaternary section, after which the lower eustatic sea level reduced the accommodation space again and only thin bioclastic bank deposits and iron-stained exposure horizon occurred. Around 0.07\u00a0Ma, the Xisha Islands were continuously exposed due to the uplifting and low eustatic sea level. The strong winter monsoon caused a heterozoan factory nearby the Xisha Islands, and blew the carbonate sediments onshore forming aeolianites. Our results proves that the total subsidence has indeed greatly influenced the evolution of Quaternary carbonate system in the Xisha area. The long-term (at scale of Myr) sea-level lowering could facilitate the flourishment of corals, and a moderate total subsidence in the context of secular sea-level lowering would provide more effective accommodation space for the continuous reef accretion, favoring the formation of thick reef units in the tropical areas.\n               ","44":"\n                  Lamina is the basic and typical \u201cbuilding block\u201d of organic-rich shales, which has significant impact on the generation, migrition, and accumulation of hydrocarbon.

The application of image stitching and processing technology intuitively and accurately obtained the pore structure among different types of laminae including siliceous laminae, mixed laminae, dolomite laminae, and calcite laminae. The results showed that the average SEM-based surface porosity of laminae was in the following order: siliceous laminae\u00a0>\u00a0calcite laminae\u00a0>\u00a0dolomite laminae\u00a0>\u00a0mixed laminae. The siliceous lamina was dominated by interparticle pores between rigid grains, and was characterized by high volume of macropore. In addition to the pores between rigid grains, pores between clay platelets resulted in a large volume of nano-scale pores. Therefore, mixed lamina was characterized by the smallest average pore diameter and the lowest SEM-based surface porosity. The SEM-based surface porosity of calcite lamina and dolomite lamina was between that of siliceous lamina and mixed lamina, and abundant interparticle pores between grains and intraparticle pores within carbonate minerals were observed in calcite lamina and dolomite lamina. The porosity and pore type of calcite laminae are similar with that of dolomite laminae in certain aspects, while the pore size distribution range of dolomite lamina was wider than that of calcite lamina and the dissolution pores of the calcite lamina contributed more pore volume than that of dolomite lamina. Diverse pore structures among different laminae may be attribute to the synergistic effect of different mineral compositions and diagenetic processes.\n               ","45":"\n                  Low-resistance shale reservoirs have prospected in many high-mature shale gas plays with distinct yields. It is worth investigating the reasons for the difference in the production of low-resistance shale. And this needs to start from the genetic mechanism of shale low resistance. The genesis of shale low resistance is currently considered to be closely related to high-mature organic matter, which is the most important storage space for shale gas. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship among organic matter properties, pore structure of shale reservoir space, and shale resistivity. Herein, the typical low-resistivity shale in southern China was examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, gas adsorption, high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry. The results show that compared with conventional resistivity shale, low resistivity shale has smaller pore volume and specific surface area and higher organic matter graphitization degree. The high degree of graphitization significantly reduces the rock resistivity. In addition, graphitization changes the mechanical properties of organic matter. Under the action of compaction and tectonic movement, the macropores decrease sharply, the mesopores increase first and then decrease, and the micropores change little with the degree of graphitization. The change in the size and shape of the organic pores results in the collapse of the organic pores and the contact of the pore walls, which further increases the migration path of the electronic currency on the conductive organic matter and makes the rock resistivity lower. When the degree of graphitization exceeds 15%, poor pore development leads to lower resistivity, and due to poor reservoir space, such shales are extremely risky for exploration.\n               ","46":"\n                  The presence of sedimentary sequences located at temperatures ranging between 60 and 120\u00a0\u00b0C has permitted the identification of hydrocarbon accumulation patterns of economic importance.

The concept of the net force during tight oil accumulation was established, and the relationship between the oiliness of the tight reservoir and the net force during the oil charging was qualitatively characterised using physical experiments and digital simulations. The results of this study indicate that two periods of oil charging occurred during 28\u201323\u00a0Ma and 12\u00a0Ma to present in the Qibei slope belt. Three stages were identified in the oil charging physical experiments and digital simulations, i.e., the breakthrough, rapid, and fully saturated stages, which had net forces of 5\u00a0MPa, 19\u00a0MPa, and 38\u00a0MPa in the Qibei slope belt, respectively. The net force and oil saturation during the late oil charging period can be used to predict the tight reservoir's oiliness. When the value was in the oil breakthrough stage, dry layers were identified; when the value was in the oil rapid charging stage, fractured oil layers were identified; and when the value was in the fully oil saturated stage, flowing oil layers could be identified.

This is a particular problem for carbonate rocks because diagenesis produces a wide range of rock microstructures and transport properties. In this work we use a large database of high quality poroperm, electrical, mercury injection capillary pressure and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements (307 core samples), representing 5 stratigraphically defined facies, as well as well log data to examine facies-recognition abilities using 8 different machine learning clustering approaches and a redundancy of 10 to ensure statistically valid results, resulting in a total of over 990 clustering runs. For a 3 cluster problem, we find that the Expectation Maximisation (92.57% success) and two types of Kmeans approaches (89.60% and 91.09%) provide the best methods. Further testing using the best of these shows that the quality of the input parameter (attribute) matters more than the number of attributes used, with the power of attributes in decreasing order being porosity, cementation exponent, permeability, pore throat diameter and free fluid index, implying that some attributes can degrade clustering performance. Further tests show that there should be at least as many attributes as clusters, in which case the machine learning can be left to choose the final number of clusters, providing the best performance in this work (69.35% success for a five cluster problem), otherwise it is best to constrain the cluster number by supervision. Application of the results from the previous testing to a mixed carbonate tight carbonate well from the Butmah formation shows satisfactory determination of 4 petrofacies by clustering (up to 91.65%) when compared to petrofacies determined manually. However, the greater challenge of clustering 9 reservoir quality classes defined using a ternary petrofacies approach did not provide a successful result (<38% success rate).\n               ","49":"\n                  The submarine Iv\u00e1\u0148 Canyon oriented parallel along the front of the Western Carpathian fold and thrust belt and the foreland of the Bohemian Massif has been studied on numerous 2D seismic sections and available borehole cores. The canyon can be followed over the distance of more than 75\u00a0km indented within the sedimentary infill of the Alpine-Carpathian Foredeep from Lower Austria into the Czech Republic. Seismic data reveal up to 600\u00a0m depth of the canyon and its width of 2.5\u20136\u00a0km. The canyon is characterized by a low sinuosity planform architecture with an axial main channel and several tributary channels of varying dimensions.

The strontium isotope stratigraphy data supported by microbiostratigraphy and by foraminiferal \u03b418O and \u03b413C isotope analysis confirmed, that the depositional history of the canyon infill lasted from the upper Burdigalian\/Langhian boundary up to the lower Serravalian, with the dominance of Langhian deposits in its infill.\n                  The formation and depositional history of the canyon is explained by the complicated structural and depositional history of the Alpine-Carpathian Foreland basin during the lower\/middle Miocene transition and middle Miocene (Langhian) with a dominant role of tectonic subsidence and basin re-configuration accompanied by eustatic sea-level fluctuations.

The syn-rift successions are Syn-Rift Unconformity (SRU)-Base of Syn-Rift (BSR), and Base Chattian Unconformity (BCU)-Syn-Rift Unconformity (SRU) sequences. Whereas, the post-rift successions represent by Intra-Aquitanian MFS (IAM)-Base Chattian Unconformity (BCU), Intra-Burdigalian MFS (IBM)-Intra-Aquitanian MFS (IAM), Miocene Transgressive-Regressive (MTR)-Intra-Burdigalian MFS (IBM), Intra-Serravalian MFS (ISM)-Miocene Transgressive-Regressive (MTR), and Intra-Tortonian (ITM)-Intra-Serravalian MFS (ISM) sequences.\n                  The Oligocene-early Miocene syn-rift succession in the study area is characterized by aggradational stacking patterns, with an indication of retrogradation in individual sand packages for SRU-BSR, and BCU-SRU intervals, whereas an overall aggradational stacking pattern can be observed within the IAM-BCU sequence. The depositional environment of the syn-rift succession is mainly deltaic, fluvial, alluvial fan, shallow and deep lacustrine at the basin center.\n                  The early-middle Miocene post-rift succession is characterized by mostly aggradational and fining upwards stacking within the IBM-IAM sequence. This gradually changed to a retrogradational pattern in the MTR-ISM sequence. Depositional environments for this succession consist of an alternation between fluvio-marine and sub-tidal to marine sedimentation. Depositional environments for the overlying late Miocene Intra-Tortonian to Intra-Serravalian (ITM-ISM) was estuarine or tidally-influenced environments comprising fluvial channel, tidal or distributary channel, tidal sand flat, and tidal flat deposition. This interval mainly consists of coarsening upward units that gradually changed to a stacked higher-order fining upwards package. The deeper stratigraphic units are generally more continental (non-marine) in character, but fluvio-tidally influenced marine environments became more dominant in the shallower sequences.\n               ","51":"\n                  The Middle Jurassic limestones of the Vajont Formation, which constitute major parts of the flanks of the Vajont Canyon (Southern Alps, Italy), have been subjected to pervasive dolomitization. The dolomites are localized within fault damage zones. Based on field and petrographic characteristics, two dolostone groups can be differentiated. Group 1, being the most prevailing, corresponds to replacive matrix dolostones. They form non-stratabound plume-like geobodies. They also occur as infill in infrequent veins in the host limestones that occur adjacent to these replacive plume-like dolostone bodies. Group 2, that is less common, consists of saddle dolomite cements. It occurs in breccia and veins or makes up zebra dolostones. The latter cements frequently affect the replacive group 1 dolostones. Fluid inclusion analyses of both dolostone groups indicate comparable salinity values of 1.2\u20135.3 eq. wt.% NaCl with homogenization temperatures of 70\u2013108\u00a0\u00b0C, which in addition of overlapping 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.70811\u20130.70846) reflect similar parental fluids. The estimated salinities, in combination with \u03b418O values (\u22125.5 to \u221214.8\u2030 V-PDB), indicate significant contributions of 18O-depleted fluids postulated to be modified meteoric waters. This origin is supported by the low trace element contents measured in the studied dolostones. These data support that the fault-controlled dolostones in the studied Vajont area precipitated from hot hypo- to mesohaline fluids. These fluids could have circulated along inherited Mesozoic syn-rift fault and fracture corridors. However, another possibility is that fluids circulated along fault and fracture systems that developed during the Neo-Alpine Orogeny (Miocene). Both could have served as efficient deep-seated fluid migration conduits as well as relatively shallow ones facilitating the downward flow of topography-driven meteoric waters.\n               ","52":"\n                  This study reports the application of a deep learning workflow using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify scanning electron microscopy (SEM) microstructural images of different shales to determine geologic formation based only on the SEM image.

Our test results show a 93% accuracy in identifying the correct formation using SEM images. In addition, we also generated the probabilities of an image associating, or being similar to, different formations. These probabilities allow the user to determine what formations or zones of a formation have similar microstructures. The most important aspect of the workflow is the extremely rapid classification.

Additionally, the distribution of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) in petroleum reservoirs was examined to investigate possible applications to petroleum systems assessments. The hydrocarbon gases were generated by thermogenic processes associated with the oil window. The 13C-enriched values for C1 (>\u221240\u2030) were interpreted as an organic source signature rather than an indication of thermal maturity, except for the oil occurrence (Field B), where a different fluid charge mainly composed of methane and CO2 from a minor external kitchen area in the Santos Basin was identified. The molecular composition and the carbon and hydrogen isotopic data of the hydrocarbon gases, when combined with the VOSC molecular compositional data, allow the identification of four gas families associated with different kitchens and\/or migrations pathways. The total VOSC concentrations range from 0.7 to 23.9\u00a0ppm by volume (ppmV). The organic sulfides are mainly composed of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and diethyl sulfide. The main thiol compound is ethanethiol. The cyclic VOSC are primarily composed of thiophene, with a negligible amount of branched thiophenes (<0.1 ppmV). H2S showed a strong positive Pearson's correlation with COS and methanethiol (MeSH) concentrations (r\u00a0=\u00a00.943 and 0.807, respectively). This suggests that COS and MeSH formation was linked to H2S generation and\/or post-catagenetic interactions between hydrocarbons and H2S, mainly related to thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR). In contrast, the distribution of higher molecular weight VOSC seems to be controlled by source rock facies, rather than H2S concentration. Principal component analysis of the VOSC compositional data identified some subgroups within the gas families mainly associated with TSR. The results presented in this work reveal that VOSC can be an important auxiliary tool in petroleum system studies.\n               ","54":"\n                  The southern Newfoundland transform margin is a crustal-scale transfer zone that juxtaposes continental crust of the Grand Banks with the oceanic domain of the Fogo Basin, offshore SE Newfoundland. This crustal feature is generally accepted as a left-lateral transfer zone between the much-studied Scotian and Newfoundland margins, but relatively little is known about either its crustal-scale architecture or tectonic evolution. Interpretation of newly available regional seismic data from the Newfoundland Ridge and Fogo Basin, offshore Canada provides evidence for approximately 500\u00a0km of left-lateral displacement and associated segmented extension between the Late Triassic (210\u00a0Ma) and latest Jurassic (145\u00a0Ma) as a result of differential extension rates between the conjugate margins of Nova Scotia\u2013Morocco and Newfoundland (Grand Banks)\u2013Iberia. We show that the southern Newfoundland transform margin represents a 100\u2013150\u00a0km wide zone of distributed left-lateral displacement across extended continental crust at the SW edge of the Grand Banks, and that crust beneath the Newfoundland Ridge and Fogo Basin is unlikely to be oceanic in origin. Kinematic restorations of regional cross sections and crustal area balancing provide the basis for map-based reconstructions of the area. Our results, which integrate existing plate reconstructions, crustal thickness data, and established age relationships, help to constrain the early structural evolution of the North Atlantic as the African and North American plates separated during Triassic to Jurassic rifting.\n               ","55":"\n                  As an important unconventional resource, shale oil plays differ from conventional reservoirs in accumulation and enrichment mechanisms of hydrocarbons.

Therefore, we collected a large number of samples from a single well that was drilled through the Es3\n                     l member to analyze mineralogy, geochemical parameters by programmed pyrolysis, thermal maturity by vitrinite reflectance (Ro%), pore structure by N2 adsorption and mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP). First, following core observations, four different lithofacies were recognized. Second, based on the S1 vs. TOC plot, we proposed five separate types of resource: enriched and (ir) recoverable resource, potential and (ir) recoverable resource, and finally ineffective resource. The quality of the resource deteriorates sequentially with the enriched and recoverable being the best and ineffective resource the worst. We concluded that the overall oil-bearing property of the Es3\n                     l is affected by both hydrocarbon generation and oil retention characteristics. Ultimately, high abundance of OM, kerogen type and thermal maturity, along with the degree of oil-enriched pores abundance will decide the most favorable conditions for shale oil accumulation\/enrichment. Considering all of these, the lower sections of the ORBMS\u2013ORBCS (organic-rich bedded mixed\/calcareous shale) and OFLCS (organic-fair laminated calcareous shale) facies were found to own the optimal combination of hydrocarbon generation and reservoir property for economical exploitation.

Because of the Late Eocene, Late Miocene and Pleistocene orogenic overprinting, the earlier extensional history of the Tunisian Atlassic province had to be reconstructed from balanced and sequentially restored transects across four key fault systems active at the time. These were used to (i) estimate the amount and timing of extension and (ii) calculate the expansion index (EI) for each fault system. The analysis demonstrates the region experienced a very significant amount of mid-Cretaceous extension, representing the last of several Permian-Mesozoic rift events. Two closely linked styles of deformation were recognised: thick-skinned basement involved faulting and shallow listric faulting detached on decollement surfaces within late Triassic evaporites. Both styles of faulting triggered salt diapirism.\n                  Sequential pre-orogenic restorations of a transect across the Tebaga Kebili and Orbata faults in the southern part of this province suggest both experienced a large amount of extensional displacement during the Aptian and Albian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a02.6\u00a0km), recorded by footwall erosion, growth strata, rollover structures and changes in sedimentary facies. A similar restoration across the Labaiedh (M'rhila-Cherichira) fault system further north, identified both thick and thin-skinned extensional movement associated with diapiric growth and salt extrusion reaching a maximum during the Aptian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a00.55\u00a0km). A pre-Tertiary restoration of the Teboursouk fault system in the northern part of the province, demonstrated thick-skinned extension peaking during the Albian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0km). This accommodated a thick sequence of basinal shales to the north, deformed by active diapirism with sea-floor salt extrusion, triggered by deep basement faulting and enhanced by the plastic incompetent character of the thick shale dominant overburden.\n                  Regional extension across the Tunisian Atlassic province during the Aptian-Albian was contemporaneous with a significant change in intra-plate stress across northern Africa, the opening of the South Atlantic and structural reorganization along the East African continental margin. This synchroneity across such a wide region may reflect some still poorly understood deep crustal processes, ultimately responsible for reactivating older rift faults and regional tilting across the province. The associated gravity salt gliding and diapirism bear comparison with the post-rift deformational style of the South Atlantic passive margin. However intra-evaporite decollement surfaces were more local, limited by active thick-skinned faulting with diapirism typically soft linked to deeper fault movement.\n               ","57":"\n                  The quartz crystallinity index (QCI) was applied to quantitatively characterise the crystallinity features of silica within the marine shale of the upper Yangtze area.

Furthermore, based on the identification and classification of graptolite biozones, a series of experimental analyses, including the total organic carbon (TOC) content, bitumen reflectance, and elemental composition, were conducted to determine the silica origin and controlling factors of crystallinity. The results indicated that biogenic silica in marine shale intervals had an obviously lower crystallinity than silica of other origins. The quartz vein in shale intervals presented the highest silica crystallinity. Silica that experienced a low diagenesis intensity exhibited the lowest crystallinity. Furthermore, biogenic silica in a state of overpressure had a much lower crystallinity than that under normal pressure. The crystallinity of silica in marine shale of the upper Yangtze area is affected by origin, diagenesis intensity, and overpressure.

On the Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian Wufeng-Longmaxi black shales, we combined petrographic features, major and trace elemental proxies, and organic carbon isotopic analysis to determine the relative importance of productivity versus anoxia on organic matter accumulation and the evolution of factors controlling organic matter accumulation across the Ordovician-Silurian boundary in the Middle Yangtze region.

Based on the stratigraphic profiles of productivity (biogenic Si and P\/Al), redox conditions (Mo\/Al, U\/Th ratios, and DOPT values), detrital fraction flux (Al2O3), and the cross-plots of biogenic Si versus Co*Mn values, our findings indicate that organic matter accumulation was a combined effect of productivity and anoxia; however, the elevated productivity caused by upwelling that introduced plenty of nutrients to the oceans was the direct factor driving organic matter accumulation. Previous research found a simultaneous variation in stratigraphic profiles of productivity and redox proxies; however, in our datasets, we found an offset between productivity geochemical proxies (biogenic Si content) and redox conditions (Mo\/Al). Biogenic Si profile peaks occur stratigraphically beneath Mo\/Al profile peaks.

Detailed sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses are essential for understanding and refining the depositional models and stratigraphic framework of the Montney Formation. Based on detailed core examination focused on sedimentological, paleontological and ichnological characteristics, eleven lithofacies and three recurring facies associations are identified within the Lower Triassic Montney Formation in northeastern British Columbia. The lithofacies identified are interpreted to have been deposited in offshore, offshore transition and lower shoreface settings, along a storm-dominated mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp. Facies associations include FA(A): siliciclastic distal offshore transition to distal offshore; FA(B): mixed siliciclastic carbonate, storm-influenced offshore to offshore transition; and FA(C): storm-dominated siliciclastic offshore transition to lower shoreface.

The solid residues were subjected to organic geochemical measurements, low-pressure gas (N2 and CO2) adsorption tests, and field emission-scatter electrical microscope analysis. The results revealed that solvent extraction played positive and negative roles in the pore development of solid residues from both systems at different thermal maturities. Inorganic and organic pores were primarily filled or shielded by soluble bitumen at low and high temperatures, respectively. The occurrences of organic matter in solid residues from the two systems were different at lower temperatures but gradually evolved similarly at higher temperatures and were dominated by nanoscale interparticle organic matter. Organic pore occurrence in solid residues from the two systems was approximately comparable. However, differences in pore volume and specific surface area of solid residues from the closed and semi-closed systems increased measurably below 550\u00a0\u00b0C. At 550\u00a0\u00b0C, a strong mechanical compaction and overpressure environment caused deformation and closure of pores surrounding rigid minerals and pores associated with ductile minerals surrounding organic matter in solid residue from the closed system, while only a few pores surrounding rigid minerals from the semi-closed system deformed. Consequently, similar pore parameters of solid residues from the two systems were obtained at this temperature. Additionally, the variation in organic porosity of solid residues from the two systems has obvious stages based on mass balance calculation. The organic porosity evolution is collectively affected by system sealing capacity and thermal maturity at lower matured stages. In contrast, organic porosity evolution in solid residues is independent of system sealing capacity at high- and overmatured stages. Although the depositional environment is different, this study provides direct evidence that the difference in system sealing capacity is not the predominant factor leading to different organic pore developments in the Silurian and Cambrian shales in South China.\n               ","62":"\n                  The study area is located at the east of Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc Basin, one of the sedimentary basins in the Central Anatolia basins between \u015e.

To eliminate the effect of contamination on \u201cfree\u201d bitumen extracted directly from source rock, \u201cenclosed\u201d and \u201cbound\u201d bitumens were released from the mineral matrix by demineralization and from the kerogen structure using an improved catalytic hydropyrolysis technique, respectively. Geochemical and carbon isotopic compositions of the three types of bitumen were used to reconstruct the geochemical characteristics of original organic matter in their source rocks. Results indicate that \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cenclosed\u201d bitumens have similar biomarker distributions and n-alkane \u03b413C values in non-contaminated cuttings, but the former is more susceptible to OBM contamination. \u201cEnclosed\u201d bitumen can thus be used to characterize the organic geochemistry of source rocks contaminated by OBM. The carbon isotopic compositions of individual n-alkanes in \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cenclosed\u201d bitumens differ from those in \u201cbound\u201d bitumen, likely because of the effects of diagenesis and other secondary alteration. \u201cBound\u201d bitumen is more likely to preserve the molecular carbon isotopic characteristics of original organic matter in source rocks, while the \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cenclosed\u201d bitumens more represent the generation products. Based on biomarker characteristics and carbon isotopic compositions of \u201cbound\u201d hydrocarbons, Wenchang (WC) Formation (Fm.) source rocks in the Zhu I Depression of the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) can be divided into three types in normal medium\u2013deep (WC\u2013I), shore\u2013shallow (WC-II), and special medium\u2013deep (with different algal blooms growth rates; WC-III) lacustrine source rocks. The special medium\u2013deep lacustrine source rocks of Wenchang Fm. are characterized by high ratio of C30 4-methylsteranes to C29 steranes (4-Me\/C29\u00a0>\u00a00.66) and heavy \u03b413C values (\u03b413Ckerogen < \u221226.1\u2030), which are obviously different from those of normal medium\u2013deep lacustrine source rocks. The combination of \u201cfree\u201d, \u201cenclosed\u201d, and \u201cbound\u201d hydrocarbons geochemical and isotopic compositions thus provides a comprehensive understanding of source rocks.\n               ","64":"\n                  The Molla-Bismil area is a petroleum province, which hosts predominantly Paleozoic oil fields in the foreland area of the Diyarbak\u0131r Basin.

This significant breakthrough reveals that the deep-wells in the Molla-Bismil area have proven the existence of a Paleozoic petroleum system. Prospective source rocks are located stratigraphically above the upper part of the Bedinan Formation (Upper Ordovician) reservoir, near the base of the Dada\u015f Formation (Llandovery, Dada\u015f-1 member). The lithology of the lower part of the Dada\u015f-1 member, also known as hot shales in the Molla-Bismil area, are typified by organic-rich brownish-black colored shale containing bitumen and thin limestone beds. New well data assists with the regional definition and correlation of typical source rock properties within the Diyarbak\u0131r Basin.

Several geological sections, across and along the offshore portion of the Sin\u00fa Fold Belt, have been constructed through geological interpretation of 2D seismic sections constrained by a few exploration wells. Their analysis has allowed us to quantify the amount of horizontal motion (shortening responsible for the structures and basal detachment displacement) and vertical motion (tectonic subsidence\/uplift and wedge vertical thickening) undergone by the belt over time; unravel its recent evolution consisting of almost no active structures in the south edge and a large amount of active structures northwards; quantify its pore pressure, coefficient of friction and strength using its wedge geometry consisting of high taper angles in the lower continental slope near the deformation front and lower taper angles in the upper continental slope away from it; and understand the aseismic and trench-lacking character of the belt. These observations have been crucial to identify the main features of the morphostructural zones across the belt (Colombian Basin, lower continental slope, upper continental slope and continental shelf) and establish a new along-strike zoning (north region influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp, Sin\u00fa Fold Belt s.s., and south salient influenced by the Uramita Fault).\n               ","66":"\n                  The Risha field is one of the Jordan's most important gas fields, but little has been known about the origins and the underlying formation mechanism(s) of its gases.

The integrated carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions reveal that the Early Silurian Mudawwara Formation is the main source for Risha gases that are dry gases with some condensates. The content of methane ranges from 90.2 to 91.7% with small amounts of ethane, propane, and non-hydrocarbon gases (CO2, N2).

This paper targets a newly discovered late Miocene multibranch submarine channel developed in the Ledong gas field, eastern margin of the Yinggehai Basin, South China Sea. The natural gas sweet spot, Ledong block, located in the intersection area of the channel's three branches, was systematically studied via zircon U\u2013Pb dating, heavy minerals, seismic and well logging approaches, and structure analysis to obtain information about the characteristics of provenance and the process of sedimentation. Detrital zircon U\u2013Pb age distribution and heavy mineral assemblage results indicate that the channel shares similar geochronological signatures of sediment from the rivers in western Hainan Island. The seismic interpretation suggests that the East Branch bifurcates at the intersection area, meeting the North Branch in the northwest and extending southeast to form the South Branch. Active fault movement during the early Miocene provides negative topography for the formation of the gravity flow channel, while the later sea level fall facilitates the transport and deposition of the river sediments. This study finally reconstructs a time series-based sedimentary model to better illustrate the channel evolution process. The development of channel reservoirs in the southeast Yinggehai Basin could be mainly constrained by the fault's activation as well as the Hainan sediment supply. The findings reveal the major provenance constraints for the evolution of a multibranch submarine channel system across the Ledong gas field and are of great significance for future natural gas resource exploration.\n               ","68":"\n                  Several research works have demonstrated that climate variations are consistent with quasi-periodic orbital parameters, particularly \u223c1.2-Myr obliquity amplitude modulation cycle has been demonstrated as a controlling factor of glacio-eustasy sequence formation in icehouse periods. In the current research, we have studied the glacio-eustasy third-order sequences of Late Miocene to Pliocene age in Qiongdongnan Basin (QDNB), South China Sea and identified a prominent \u223c1.2-Myr periodicity in a 41kyr-tuned gamma ray series of Well LS33-1-1. In the current research, we developed an astronomical time scale (ATS) for Late Miocene to Pliocene in QDNB and conducted cyclostratigraphic analyses on Huangliu and Yinggehai Formations in Well LS33-1-1 using high-resolution natural gamma-ray (GR) data. Time-series analyses on GR data revealed rich Milankovitch frequency band series and \u223c5.6, 3.8 and 6.0\u00a0m cycles were respectively filtered for three segments in depth domain which presented direct correlation with 41-kyr obliquity cycles in La2004 solution. In this work, foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil biozones in South China Sea were selected as age markers for tuning. Correlation coefficient analysis was applied to quantitatively measure the fitting of witnessed sedimentary cycles to astronomical periods and provide a possible range for sedimentation rate. Also, we developed a sedimentary noise model to detect high-resolution sea-level variations under the control of orbital forcing which were supported by previous third-order eustasy variations. In addition, six third-order sequences were identified in the range of Late Miocene to Pliocene representing astronomical forcing through both \u223c1.2-Myr filtering of DYNOT model and \u223c1.2-Myr modulation of obliquity amplitude based on sedimentary noise modeling. Finally, it was concluded that the \u223c1.2-Myr cycle was the most important driving force for sequence development and third-order sea-level changes.\n               ","69":"\n                  The deflection of prodeltas caused by coastal currents is a significant contributor to deltaic asymmetry and clastic sediment masses on continental shelves. In the past, researchers supported that highly asymmetric deltas were usually unidirectional, or single-prodelta systems. Here, we present an exception in the Yellow River prodelta system. Using combined geophysical, lithological and geochemical evidence, the presence and pattern of Yellow River-derived subaqueous accumulation within the northwestern Bohai Sea were examined. We identified a northeastward alongshore transport mechanism that has resulted in arrays of shore-parallel, seabed trough-and-bump features predating the mid-Holocene highstand and a mudbelt capping most of these features since the highstand. The mudbelt is detached from the adjacent Luanhe River prodelta and thickens seaward and northeastward (downcurrent of the dominant coastal current). It includes a shoreface-detached mound that thickens to 10\u00a0m, and it overlaps and corresponds to the landward portion of the Bohai central muds. Geochemical evidence and previous provenance studies (using cores and surficial sediments collected from the central muds) have suggested that the majority of the central muds were supplied by the Yellow River and have accumulated since the mid-Holocene. We therefore interpret the central muds with a deflected prodelta of the Yellow Rive rather than the adjacent Luanhe River. This newly identified deflected prodelta, combined with the previously described \u201cunique\u201d Yellow River distal wedge off the Shandong Peninsula, resulted in a dual-prodelta system that consists of a pair of separated, highly asymmetric prodeltas. This system is a peculiar and complex pattern of deltaic asymmetry that has not been previously proposed. It is argued here that our case is dominated by regional bifurcated coastal currents and frequent lobe switching of the delta plain; a similar complex pattern of delta asymmetry can be expected under environments where plume deflections could undergo significant change.\n               ","70":"\n                  Lower to Middle Permian strata in the Delaware Basin in southeast New Mexico and West Texas present a unique system to assess spatial and temporal variations in carbonate slopes as well as controls on variation. Detailed subsurface gamma-ray well-log mapping and visualization using approximately 8000 densely spaced well logs in the northern portion of the Delaware Basin aided in correlating and characterizing Wolfcampian and Leonardian (L1-L6 composite sequences) slope profiles. The Wolfcampian strata form irregular slope profiles ranging from 2 to 10\u00b0. L1-L2 composite sequences develop comparatively steeper aggradational to retrogradational slopes with maximum mapped gradients between 15 and 25\u00b0, platform to basin relief of 920\u20131100\u00a0m, and slope widths of 10\u201320\u00a0km. The L3-L6 composite sequences denote a shift to platform and margin progradation. However these intervals exhibit variable progradational profiles in the along the western slopes with maximum slope gradients between 2 and 10\u00b0, progradation aggradation ratios ranging approximately from 10 to 100, wider slope widths reaching over 30\u00a0km, and platform to basin relief ranging from 500 to 900\u00a0m while northern slopes exhibited more continuous steep gradients between 10 and 20\u00b0, progradation-aggradation ratios of 0\u201313, slope widths of 10\u201315\u00a0km, and average approximate platform to basin relief of 900\u00a0m.\n                  The broad shift from aggradation-retrogradation to progradation during the Leonardian correlates with low-order sea-level change previously noted from outcrop studies. The eustatic shift likely influenced platform accommodation, driving a regional transition to progradation during low-order highstand. The variation in Leonardian progradation rates is significantly influenced by underlying Pennsylvanian carbonate buildups generating large-scale inflections in the slope and toe-of-slope environments. The underlying feature generated lower platform to basin relief and wider slopes to the west, promoting progradation, and formed narrower slopes with greater platform to basin relief to the north, likely inhibiting rapid progradation. Bottom currents and subsequent drift deposition along the western slopes also changed slope angle and geometry, promoting progradation over and around the features in subsequent units. Also, bottom currents possibly swept sediments from toe of slope environments in the north where drifts aren't present, inhibiting progradation and driving aggradation.\n                  The documented spatial and temporal variations in slope profiles may exert significant influence on transport, routing, and confinement of platform-top and slope-derived sediments to the deeper basin, imparting control on basinal stratigraphic architecture. As such, this type of characterization should provide a predictive tool for assessing reservoir and non-reservoir architecture in the slope and re-sedimented basinal deposits in both the Permian Basin and other analogous basins.\n               ","71":"\n                  Mass transport complexes and their associated mass transport deposits\u2014both referred to here as submarine failure deposits\u2014are virtually ubiquitous in the modern and ancient sedimentary record of many deepwater basins. As exploration expands to new frontiers, submarine failure deposits are being identified as components of the petroleum system in numerous prospects. Although such deposits were historically considered facies to avoid from a viewpoint of petroleum exploration, it is now recognized that they can act as source, reservoir, or seal elements. In this paper, we set out to investigate the role of submarine failure deposits as effective seals in the petroleum system using published data and propose a methodology to risk some first-order factors at a macro-, meso-, and micro-scale that influence the seal quality of these submarine failure deposits. We accomplish this by discussing the properties intrinsic to submarine failure deposits that affect the seal quality at different scales. Based on published literature, at least six offshore fields from the Gulf of Mexico and NW Borneo are reported to have a submarine failure deposit as an effective seal. These fields combined account for \u223c0.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent of cumulative discovered reserves globally and prove the potential of submarine failure deposits as effective seals and a future undervalued play concept. We use three case studies to illustrate our methodology. Our methodology can be further customized using datasets from industry and public records. The seal risk matrix presented here is based on more than a decade of research and has been already used by several exploration companies with encouraging feedback. We acknowledge the limitations of the methodology, but future interdisciplinary research and integration of new datasets and results will improve the de-risking of submarine failure deposits in exploration.

Improved constraints on resolution can provide input into monitoring requirements and detectability of CO2 leakage, and fault-sealing properties during subsurface visualization of migration pathways. This study explores detection and resolution thresholds via synthetic seismic imaging of a detailed shallow normal fault model with realistic fault architecture including sub-seismic structures of damage zones. The base fault model is built from interpretations of high-resolution P-Cable seismic data and is further developed and conditioned by outcrop-based observations and empirical laws for fracture and deformation band distribution. Damage zones of sandstone layers host deformation bands contrary to shale layers with fractures, while mixed lithologies (shaley sandstone and sandy shale) are subjected to a combination of the two deformation mechanisms. We utilize a 2D point-spread function based convolution seismic modelling to produce the synthetic seismic images. Test scenarios include one baseline fault model without a damage zone (M1), and five more advanced\/detailed fault models incorporating features known from outcrops (M2-M6; damage zones, an isolated fracture corridor, and gas seeps (CO2) along damage zones of faults and in the fracture corridor). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on two selected models test the effect of changing the illumination angle and wavelet. The results show that: (1) faults with damage zones have larger disturbances in seismic signals than faults without damage zones, (2) stronger amplitudes are distinguished for models with CO2-filled fractures, (3) a fracture corridor (5\u00a0m at it widest) is clearly visible where it crosses horizons bounding horizontal layers, (4) sensitivity tests show good imaging for illumination \u226545\u00b0, which is the average dip of the main fault segment, and (5) learnings from fault modelling offer guidance for seismic monitoring.\n               ","73":"\n                  The soaring domestic energy consumption in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) continues to create a demand and supply gap. Paleozoic tight sand and shale reservoirs in KSA are considered potential sources of natural gas that could meet the growing domestic demand. To enhance the exploration and exploitation of these unconventional systems, research focusing on their reservoir quality has tremendously increased in the past few decades. A challenging aspect of these Paleozoic reservoirs is that they have similar lithologies and are poorly constrained biostratigraphically. Therefore, facies analysis, stratigraphic correlation, and geosteering are problematic. This paper describes how chemostratigraphic markers are used to identify and separate individual lithologies. Three hundred and twenty (320) data points were acquired by scanning both end caps of 165 core plug samples from continuously cored sections of three Paleozoic formations. Raw elemental spectral data were acquired using a high-resolution tabletop \u03bcXRF system. Multivariate statistical analysis including principal component analysis (PCA), pairwise correlation, and hierarchical clustering of principal components (HCPC) were used to characterize the acquired geochemical values. Eleven (11) chemofacies, within three lithofacies with clearly defined boundaries, were identified. Stratigraphic distribution patterns of the geochemical signatures (e.g., Si, Ca, Mn, Al, K, and Fe), such as sharp truncation at the upper and lower bounds, clearly defined each lithofacies. Thus, key marker elements for each lithofacies and chemozones were identified, even where the lithologies appeared homogeneous. The overall results indicate sediment deposition under varied depositional settings, from fluvial to shallow-marine environments. The results demonstrate that elemental compositional analysis can be used as a discriminating tool for resolving stratigraphic uncertainties. Such data can document subtle variations among samples that appear homogeneous using other techniques.\n               ","74":"\n                  The North Alpine Thrust Front divides the outer wedge of the northern Alps from its foredeep, the North Alpine Foreland Basin, representing a classic fold-and-thrust-belt system.

To do so, we analyze velocity, pore pressure and drilling data of 20 deep wellbores along both sides of the North Alpine Thrust Front. Our results indicate that overpressure in the wedge is largely driven syntectonically by horizontal loading, while vertical loading appears to be the main overpressure mechanism not only in the foredeep but also in the footwall of the wedge.

It was documented that the inversion time, intensity, and type (orthogonal versus oblique or compressional versus transpressional\/transtensional) differ from one basin to another in the northern part of Egypt. The geologic structures of Abu Roash helped to define a transpressional (oblique) inversion tectonic model that started at the Santonian and ended by the Latest Senonian.

The modified van Krevelen diagram, using the hydrogen and oxygen indices, has become a commonly used tool for organic matter classification. It assumes that the components used to calculate the two indices are representative of the indigenous organic matter, which is especially the case for the oxygen index. This study provides a series of experimental results that further characterize the impact of siderite on the hydrogen and oxygen index values, which decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing mineral content. This work suggests that the changes in hydrogen index values are a result of the interaction between the mineral phase and the generated hydrocarbons, where hydrocarbons may be adsorbed on to the mineral surfaces and not fully released. The increase in the oxygen index appears to be a result of mineral decomposition and the release of CO2. The oxygen index was found to be particularly sensitive to the presence of siderite in the sample. Siderite decomposition was found to occur at temperatures below often published decomposition temperatures and at or below the S3 peak trapping temperature (390\u00a0\u00b0C). Thus, the impact of organic carbon content and mineral interaction need to be taken into consideration when characterizing organic matter, especially when siderite and to a lesser extent other carbonate minerals are present. At lower organic carbon levels, organic matter will appear more gas-prone and would suggest that the organic matter has been strongly oxidized. Although corrections have been proposed in the literature they reduce the value of the Rock-Eval \u201cquick\u201d screen by adding additional analyses or data treatment.

Sections that show evidence of anoxia or euxinic conditions simultaneously represent the lowest terrigenous influence, suggesting that anoxia is closely linked to sea-level fluctuations in the course of eustatic transgression-regression cycles. A distinctive correlation pattern of organic matter quantities and redox proxies suggests that organic matter accumulation and preservation are mainly controlled by paleoredox conditions and, therefore, regression-transgression cycles.

Abrupt lithological changes around 1700\u00a0m depth, along with a sonic shift probably corresponding to a paraconformity and some biostratigraphical events allowed us to suggest that the K\/Pg transition might be close to this depth. These assemblages bear several species that characterize the upper Maastrichtian \u2013 Danian interval in many sites from low, middle and high latitudes studied with high sampled resolution. These records demonstrate that the dinoflagellate provincialism suggested more than four decades ago for the Campanian cannot be recognized for successions younger than Maastrichtian. Our results permit the definition of a biostratigraphy that will assist drilling and hydrocarbon exploration in this and other mid-latitude Southwestern Atlantic basins.\n               ","79":"\n                  The analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) contents is an important activity in exploring potentially hydrocarbon-generating intervals. Petroleum source rocks have, by definition, high TOC values due to the accumulation of organic matter in anoxic and low-energy deposition environments over geological time. Such petroleum generation is called conventional because it results from the increasing temperature and pressure conditions during continuous sedimentary burial. On the other hand, unconventional generation refers to reserves formed due to another heat source, for example, associated with intrusive igneous emplacement. In the last decade, there has been a growing economic interest in exploring unconventional hydrocarbon reserves because of the abundance of its occurrences. However, finding ways to assess the total organic carbon (TOC) content at lower cost and time-consuming laboratory experiments is becoming fundamental due to the importance of TOC in the analysis of the composition of these resources. This study predicts TOC using a hybrid approach, integrating machine learning models into a Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm to adjust their parameters. The performance of four methods was compared: Elastic Net Linear Model, Extreme Learning Machine, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Linear Support Vector Regression. The methodology was evaluated by applying core samples of the shale gas field YuDong-Nan belonging to the Sichuan Basin. The results show that the machine learning methods assisted by the evolutionary algorithm could accurately estimate TOC and be used to further exploratory geological analysis, especially those related to the prospects of unconventional oil-gas resources.\n               ","80":"\n                  The middle Miocene Kareem Formation is a major hydrocarbon reservoir in the Gulf of Suez rift basin. The middle Miocene Kareem Formation is a major hydrocarbon reservoir in the Gulf of Suez rift basin. The age of this formation has remained controversial due to the lack of clear marker species and the presence of barren intervals in evaporite seals or sand reservoirs. Furthermore, until now, the absolute age and duration of a well-known recognized hiatus (T40) in this formation has\u00a0not been estimated. Here, we establish the precise age and extent of the Kareem Formation based on the integration of foraminifer and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, with the establishment of an astronomically tuned timescale (ATS) based on gamma-ray variations of two wells, Gs197-2 in the October Basin and J58-81 in the July Basin. These two wells represent the most complete cored sequence of the Middle Miocene Kareem Formation, recording six calcareous nannofossil, four planktonic, and one benthic foraminiferal biohorizons, that enable us to define the Langhian-Serravalian boundary. According to our new biostratigraphically-supported ATS, we estimate that the Kareem Formation spans from 13.25 to 15 Ma. The T40 hiatus is identified in both wells at the boundary between the Shagar and Rahmi Members, with an estimated duration of ca. 0.26 Myr and 0.18 Myr for Gs197-2 and J58-81, respectively. A pronounced obliquity imprint is recorded in the upper Langhian to Serravalian of Gs197-2 well, right above the T40 hiatus.\n               ","81":"\n                  The Sohar Basin, located offshore the East Coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is an area that has seldom been the focus of international oil companies. While all commercial discoveries in the UAE and Oman have been made to the west and south of the Oman Mountains, the Sohar Basin is underexplored and remains prospective. This lack of activity is primarily because the Thamama reservoir, which has yielded huge success to the west of the Oman Mountains is likely not present within the Sohar Basin. However, potential traps, reservoirs, and source rocks are present within the Tertiary succession. The Sohar Basin formed in the late Cretaceous after the obduction of the Semail Ophiolite onto the Arabian Plate. Following a period of tectonic quiescence, which lasted until the Early Eocene, the gravitational collapse occurred along the eastern edge of the present-day Oman Mountains.\n                  Interpretation of both 2D and 3D seismic reveals that the subsurface is comprised of three tectonostratigraphic units, defined as pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic packages. North-South trending thrust faults generate distinct mini-basins within the pre- and syn-tectonic sequences. The post-tectonic sequence is defined by the development of prograding systems in a tectonically quiescent margin formed in the Lower Miocene and which persists to the present day. Deep-water depositional systems dominate the undrilled far-east and south of the basin where the presence of submarine canyon systems and associated basin floor fans is supported by 3D seismic data. In recent times, the Sohar Basin has been subject to extensional faulting likely driven by sediment load caused by a prograding delta system.\n                  The results of this work reveal that multiple untested play types exist within the Sohar Basin, which are comprised of both structural and stratigraphic elements. This paper integrates both a structural and sequence stratigraphic interpretation to provide insights into the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Sohar Basin. Consequently, the fundamentals of play fairway mapping have been employed to unlock the hydrocarbon prospectivity offshore the UAE's East Coast.\n               ","82":"\n                  Generally, researchers believe that authigenic quartz precipitates in acidic medium and authigenic albite precipitates in alkaline medium. However, the lacustrine carbonate-rich fine-grained sedimentary rocks in the upper fourth sub-member and the lower third sub-member (Es4\n                     s\u2013Es3\n                     x) of the Shahejie Formation in the Jiyang Depression were observed and it was found that authigenic microcrystalline quartz and albite generally develop together. Moreover, authigenic quartz and albite also develop with microcrystalline Fe-rich dolomite and calcite in clay laminae, while in carbonate laminae, they primarily develop with recrystallized calcite. In this study, thin-section, cathodoluminescence, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and inclusion analyses were conducted to study authigenic minerals. The results show that authigenic quartz and albite are characterized by rich Ge in mudstone, and the material components mainly originate from the transformation of clay minerals and the dissolution of terrigenous feldspar debris. In limestone, they are characterized by poor Ge, and the material components primarily originate from the transformation of clay minerals. The paragrowth and intergrowth of authigenic quartz and albite primarily depend on the degree of supersaturation of the corresponding ion concentration under high temperature, high or ultrahigh pressure. During the early diagenetic stage, authigenic quartz and albite initially formed in a weakly alkaline environment; however, on entering the middle diagenetic period, authigenic quartz, albite, and sparry calcite formed in a weakly acidic environment, and the formation rate reached its peak. Our results elucidate the migration direction and enrichment law of shale oil in calcareous fine-grained sedimentary rocks through the genetic mechanism of authigenic quartzs and albites. Shale oil is generated from organic matter in the clay lamina, following which it migrates, accumulates, and preserves to the adjacent sparry calcite lamina under the joint driving effect of organic matter hydrocarbon generation overpressure and clay mineral dehydration overpressure.\n               ","83":"\n                  The surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is among the most important geological events in Earth's history, but the growth of the eastern TP margin that yielded the thickened crust and abrupt topography remains controversial. In this paper, six sample apatite fission-track (AFT) analyses of three boreholes in the Xiji Basin are applied to constrain the Mesozoic-Cenozoic uplift and exhumation history of the eastern Qilian Shan, northeastern TP. Most of the AFT ages range from 134\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0Ma to 117\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0Ma, except for the shallowest sample, with a younger age of 65.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma. Thermal history modeling indicates that the eastern Qilian Shan experienced a three-phase differential cooling history: (1) widespread rapid cooling during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (ca. 174-120\u00a0Ma, Stage 1), (2) regional cooling during the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene (ca. 80-60\u00a0Ma, Stage 2) and (3) widespread cooling during the Eocene-early Miocene (ca. 40-20\u00a0Ma, Stage 3). We conclude that the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous was the main stage of the growth and thickening of the northeastern TP, which was related to the upper-crustal horizontal shortening of the eastern Qilian Shan. Thermal history modeling of the youngest sample and seismic profile analysis imply significant reactivation of the Liupanshan fault zone during ca. 80-60\u00a0Ma. This locally intense uplift and deformation on the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan during the Late Cretaceous was likely induced by the closure of the Neo-Tethys and the continued shortening of the Lhasa-Qiangtang block. Late Eocene-Early Miocene (ca. 40-20\u00a0Ma) cooling of the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan records the coeval crustal extension and exhumation of the northeastern margin of the TP as the far-field effect of subduction of the western Pacific plate. Our AFT data detect no intense late Cenozoic reactivation information for the Xiji region, which indicates that the ca. 15-7\u00a0Ma rapid uplift triggered by fault reactivation was only located in the Haiyuan-Liupanshan fault zone, along the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan, northeastern TP. This multi-phase exhumation history is not beneficial for regional hydrocarbon exploration.\n               ","84":"\n                  Here we present a study on the formation process and Re\u2013Os systematics of the bitumen discovered in a CO2-rich pre-salt gas reservoir, south Kwanza Basin, offshore Angola. The magmatism-derived CO2 may have expanded downwards from the top of the reservoir, creating CO2 concentration and temperature gradients within the reservoir, and leading to the gradients of asphaltene precipitation and thermal cracking. The heat front may have been behind the CO2 front due to the heat exchange with surrounding rocks. Thus, asphaltene precipitation has likely occurred before the thermal cracking. Such bitumen formation process is consistent with the observed decreasing bitumen content and Rock-Eval Tmax with depth, and also the characteristics of the whole rock and bitumen Re and Os concentrations.\n                  Five closely spaced bitumen samples define a Re\u2013Os age of 116\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029\u00a0Ma that is identical to the timing of CO2 charging and thus may indicate the timing of bitumen formation. The heterogeneous 187Os\/188Os and lack of mobility of the asphaltene deposit, and the relatively low extent of thermal cracking (Tmax of 425\u2013470\u00a0\u00b0C) may account for the lack of homogenization of the bitumen initial 187Os\/188Os.\n                  Given the highly radiogenic initial 187Os\/188Os (ca. 1.2\u20131.8) of the bitumen and limited 187Os\/188Os ingrowth within the ca. 15 million years from the deposition of potential source rock (Barremian-Aptian Red and Grey Cuvo formations) to the bitumen formation, the source rock should possess a highly radiogenic initial 187Os\/188Os (>1). This is consistent with that of the equivalent lacustrine strata in the conjugated Brazilian marginal basins. Thus, the Os isotope composition indicates that the lacustrine Red and Grey Cuvo formations could be the source rock for the bitumen of the studied CO2-rich pre-salt gas reservoir in the south Kwanza Basin.\n               ","85":"\n                  Lamina is the smallest megascopic layer in a sedimentary sequence. Different laminae are usually distinguished by various mineral compositions and different thicknesses ranging from tens of micrometers to several millimeters, which significantly affects shale deformation and fracture extension during shale gas\/oil exploitation. Nevertheless, due to the minute thickness of laminae, it is hardly possible to determine their elastic moduli by traditional standard mechanical methods and detailed mechanical properties of laminae have been rarely reported. In this work, we studied the elastic modulus differences of laminae in continental shale using micro-indentation technique and scanned electronic microscope (SEM) equipped with automatic mineral identification and characterization system (AMICS). The results demonstrate that the elastic moduli of laminae are highly heterogeneous and can be classified into three types: the stiffer layer, the intermediate layer, and the soft layer, corresponding to the pyritic lamina, the sandy lamina, and the organic-rich lamina, respectively. Additionally, the elastic modulus of lamina excellently correlates with mineral compositions, with the weight coefficients of different minerals on the composite elastic modulus of lamina differing greatly. With the combination of the thickness and the elastic modulus of every single lamina within the shale, it is accessible to obtain the elastic modulus of shale by analytical solutions. Therefore, an efficient method is proposed to characterize the cross-scale elastic modulus from nano\/submicron mineral to macro rock based on the mineral components and geometric analysis of laminae, which is rapid and economically feasible, particularly helpful when neither sufficient samples nor logging data are available.\n               ","86":"\n                  Porous and permeable crystalline rocks have the potential of being hydrocarbon reservoirs. In many cases, reservoir properties are created by rock-altering physico-chemical processes occurring in the near-surface environment. Hydrocarbon reservoirs in altered granitoids may comprise both arenaceous (clay-poor) and argillaceous (clay-rich) palaeoregoliths, and hence outcrop analogues from various environments are required. In the Sila Massif, southern Italy, the arenaceous weathering of medium to coarse grained granodioritic rocks has been studied. The pore system, dominated by microfractures, was described and quantified at each stage in the weathering process (altered coherent rock facies \u2192 saprock facies\u2192 lower and upper saprolite facies \u2192 soil) in relation to changes in chemical and physical properties. The transformation of rock to saprolite was close to an isochemical process, as demonstrated by the low variations in the bulk mass transfer coefficient (\u03c4bulk). At the same time, trans-, intra- and intermineral microfractures increased in frequency and aperture upwards through the regolith profile. It was the main reason for the reduction of bulk densities (\u03c1b) from 2.66\u00a0g\/cm3 in the altered coherent rock to 1.88\u00a0g\/cm3 in the saprolite, corresponding to the formation of up to 30% porosity (\u03c6c). The results suggest that a volume increase of >50%, represented by the volumetric strain factor (\u03b5), was the main cause for the transformation of solid crystalline rock to porous saprolite. Anisovolumetric arenaceous regoliths with minimal mass loss, are the result of one of the major weathering processes, notwithstanding that they are much less understood than isovolumetric, anisochemical, argillaceous regoliths. Arenaceous saprolites potentially can have excellent porosity and permeability properties, with open and well-connected microfractures. Reservoir quality of arenaceous saprolites is in stark contrast to the poor permeability observed in some argillaceous saprolites where porosity is dominated by isolated dissolution voids within a clay-rich matrix.\n               ","87":"\n                  High-quality 3D seismic reflection and well data are used to investigate the distribution, evolution history and significance of tectonic faulting in a salt minibasin offshore Esp\u00edrito Santo, SE Brazil. Displacement-length (Dmax-L) plots, displacement-depth (D-Z) plots and structural maps are compiled to understand the growth history of distinct fault families. Interpreted structures include crestal, corridor, listric and keystone faults. Their geometry, orientation and relative distribution reveal important differences. In detail, listric faults were formed in the investigated salt withdrawal basin following a NW to WNW strike, and show multiple bright spots and pockmarks around them. The strata into which listric faults sole out have similar seismic, lithological and petrophysical characters to known Cenomanian to Turonian source rocks, which comprise shales and marls with high gamma-ray values. Low-amplitude to transparent seismic facies further indicate the presence of ductile, highly likely organic-rich shales and marls. As a result, three evolutionary stages can be identified: a) Stage 1 is characterised by the formation of NW- or WNW-striking listric faults, keystone faults and the onset of reactive diapirism; b) Stages 2 and 3 record active diapirism due to a relative increase in sediment loading, documenting the formation of many crestal, corridor and keystone faults. Importantly, normalised leakage factor analyses reveal keystone faults to be the most favourable pathways to fluid migrating in the investigated salt minibasin. Conversely, listric faults are likely to form barriers and baffles to fluid in their lower parts.\n               ","88":"\n                  In rift basins, normal faults conducting and sealing fluids are the main mechanisms for evaluating fault-related reservoirs, and the defined threshold value of fault conduction or sealing is based on statistics. However, fault transmissibility characteristics under a transition condition of fault conduction and sealing have not been clarified. This study used structural deformation and hydrocarbon charging as a foundation to quantitatively characterize fault transmissibility under the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing. This study examined faults occurring in sandstone\u2013mudstone interbeds and used the fault throw and mudstone content as the main variables. The physical simulation results revealed that despite all models exhibiting simple \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture with only a fault core, their internal composition undergoes a sequential change from the mudstone drag, mudstone drag and sliding surface to the mudstone breccia and sliding surface. Similarly, when the fault is in the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing under the constraints of mudstone, a normal distribution is observed in terms of the number of oil-bearing layers, oil-bearing length, and oil-bearing area of the lateral fault conduction. However, when the shale smear factor (SSF) is too high, the \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture mainly comprises the mudstone breccia and sliding surface, which increases the vertical fault transmission and reduces the lateral fault conduction. Conversely, an excessively small SSF, where the fault zone is a \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture comprising mainly the mudstone drag or mudstone drag and sliding surface, will restrict the vertical fault transmission and reduce the lateral fault conduction. When the lateral fault conduction near the inflection point of the normal distribution reaches its threshold, the superposition of mudstone along the fault and the presence of mudstone breccia in the fault zone become critical for decelerating the vertical fault transmission and accelerating the lateral fault conduction. The study of normal fault transmissibility characteristics under the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing provides a solid theoretical foundation for the risk assessment of fault-related hydrocarbon accumulation.\n               ","89":"\n                  A detailed biostratigraphic and organic geochemical investigation was undertaken of an organic-rich, lacustrine interval at \u223c2622\u20132639\u00a0m in well 16\/4\u201310, in the Fosen Prospect on the Utsira High in the Norwegian North Sea. A Bajocian to Aalenian age is suggested, similar to that for the immediately overlying Sleipner Fm, whereas the underlying strata were effectively barren and could not be dated with confidence. The dark grey claystone of the lacustrine unit is dominated by Botryococcus contributions, as indicated by palynofacies analysis. The kerogen exhibits a typical algaenan signature with a dominant single activation energy value of \u223c54.5\u00a0kcal\/mol for its bulk kinetics. Total organic carbon (TOC) increases from \u223c2% at the base to \u223c11% at the top, although the hydrogen index (HI) varies throughout (\u223c400\u2013\u223c800\u2030 HC\/Corg). The unit is on the verge of oil generation (Tmax \u223c446\u00a0\u00b0C; estimated vitrinite reflectance 0.5\u20130.6%; spore colour index 5). Overall, it is similar to lacustrine intervals reported in the M\u00f8yfrid Discovery (North Sea wells 2\/2-1 and 2\/2\u20134) and Kap Stewart (Jameson Land, East Greenland). Freshwater\/brackish lacustrine environment indications include a high tetracyclic polyprenoid (TPP) ratio and particularly abundant 4-methyl-24-ethylcholestanes. Specific botryococcal markers are absent, but the abundant 24-ethylcholestanes probably derive from this organism. Algal contributions increase upwards (at the expense of woody higher plants), as do 3-methylhopanes, whereas the pristane\/phytane ratio (Pr\/Ph) decreases (from \u223c4 to 2), which may reflect increasing methanogenic\/methylotophic activity. The immediately overlying Sleipner Fm has much lower TOC and HI values and a greater woody higher plant contribution, in what appears to be a proximal marine setting. Beneath the lacustrine facies is \u223c10\u00a0m of dominantly sandstone, underlain by brown claystone, exhibiting the characteristics of a highly oxic marine environment, with very low TOC and HI values, but high oxygen index (OI) and Pr\/Ph. The Fosen lake seems to correspond to one of numerous mini-basins in the area attributed to Zechstein salt withdrawal during the Jurassic. Like the M\u00f8yfrid lake, it appears to lie near the periphery of the sub-aerial, central North Sea volcanic dome. It is possible that organic-rich lacustrine facies developed in other, deeper mini-basins and have expelled some oil. Their subtle contributions to accumulations bearing other Jurassic charges may have been overlooked in the absence of obvious biomarker characteristics.\n               ","90":"\n                  This study integrates field structural data, petrographic and geochemical (\u03b418O, \u03b413C, \u039447, 87Sr\/86Sr, and elemental composition) analyses and U\u2013Pb dating of calcite veins cutting the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Southern Pyrenees) in order to date and to investigate the spatio-temporal relationships between fluid flow and fold evolution. This E-W trending anticline grew from Late Cretaceous to Paleocene at the front of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet deforming pre-growth and growth sedimentary sequences. U\u2013Pb dating reveals Late Cretaceous to late Miocene deformation ages, which agree with the age of growth strata deposition and the sequence of deformation interpreted from field and microstructural data. Dates coeval (71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma) and postdating (55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma) Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene growth strata are interpreted to record: (i) the growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline during the B\u00f3ixols thrust emplacement, and (ii) the tightening of the anticline during the southern tectonic transport of the South-Central Pyrenean Unit. Other ages (20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma) postdate the folding event and have been associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The geochemistry of calcite veins indicates that the fluid flow behavior varied across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline through its growth, showing a compartmentalized fluid system. In the hinge of the anticline and in the upper Santonian to middle Campanian syn-orogenic sequence along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the similar petrographic and geochemical features between all calcite cements and host rocks point towards a locally-derived or well-equilibrated fluid system. Contrarily, along large faults such as the B\u00f3ixols thrust, and in the anticline limbs, the geochemistry of vein cements indicates a different scenario. Cements in large faults yielded the lightest \u03b418O values, from \u22128 to \u221214 \u2030VPDB, and variable enrichment in \u03b413C, 87Sr\/86Sr, elemental composition and \u03b418Ofluid. This is interpreted as the migration of fluids, through fault zones, that evolved from distinct fluid origins. Cements in the fold limbs exhibit \u03b418O and \u03b413C between \u22128 and \u22126 \u2030VPDB and between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02 \u2030VPDB, respectively, the lowest Sr contents and the lowest precipitation temperatures, suggesting that the anticline limbs recorded the infiltration and evolution of meteoric waters. The paleohydrological system in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline was restricted to the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet. The Upper Triassic evaporitic basal detachment likely acted as a lower fluid barrier, preventing the input of fluids from deeper parts of the Pyrenean crustal thrust system. This study provides a well-constrained absolute timing of fracturing and fluid flow during basin inversion and folding evolution and highlights the suitability of U\u2013Pb geochronology to refine the age of fractures and veins and their sequential evolution in orogenic belts.\n               ","91":"\n                  The Cretaceous Second White Specks Formation is an organic-rich marine mudstone rich in calcareous coccoliths and fecal pellets that form an immature oil shale deposit. Corehole and outcrop oil shale samples, taken from western Manitoba and across Saskatchewan, Canada, were analyzed by organic petrography (reflected white and UV light), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and elemental analysis (boron and sulfur) to characterize the oil shales in relation to their depositional environment and hydrocarbon generating potential. This study revealed that the oil shales all contain small amounts of sapropelite\/huminite and inertinite. Inertinite consists of particles deposited from a terrigenous environment and have higher %Ro\u00a0>\u00a00.4, referred to as secondary inertinite. Primary inertinite is associated with the roots of marine grass and seaweeds. Fluorescing marine telalginite, Nostochopsis alginite, dinoflagellates, liptodetrinite, matrix bituminite, and chlorophyllinite are also present. Based on a detailed geological, sedimentological, geochemical, and organic petrological investigation, the oil shales were divided into three depositional facies: coastal marine (B:60\u00a0ppm), shallow marine (B: \u223c80\u00a0ppm), and open marine (B:113\u00a0ppm). The oil shales are immature (Tmax\u00a0=\u00a0398\u2013425\u00a0\u00b0C) across the entire study area with %Ro of 0.20\u20130.27.

On the other hand, the shallow marine facies oil shales have average TOC of 8.1\u00a0wt%, average S2 of 41.2\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC, and are much higher in B content (ave.\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0ppm). The open marine facies oil shales have low TOC (ave.\u00a0=\u00a00.94\u00a0wt%), S2 averages 1.3\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC, and HI averages 189\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC. They have much lower hydrocarbon potential (ave.\u00a0=\u00a01.50 lit\/tonne) but are high in B content (ave.\u00a0=\u00a0109\u00a0ppm). Overall, it was concluded that in one specific area in the Pasquia Hills of northeastern Saskatchewan, the Second White Specks oil shales are shallow (<100\u00a0m deep), thick (10\u201345\u00a0m), have TOC of >7\u00a0wt%, and can generate >80 lit\/tonne of hydrocarbon.

However, neither the basement nor Hormuz salt are penetrated or imaged by available well and seismic data due to thick Phanerozoic sediments. In this study, we have used the residual gravity anomaly of the sedimentary layer throughout the UAE by subtracting the gravity response of the basement structure from the isostatic residual gravity anomaly. The structure and distribution of the low-density Hormuz salt were then delineated for the first time by applying a 3D constrained layer inversion method on the residual gravity anomaly of the sedimentary layer. Well data were used to constrain this inversion from which the density of the reference model and the isosurface of the Hormuz salt were defined, whilst seismic profiles were used to qualitatively check the location, shape and depth of the domal structures. The inversion model shows that the Hormuz salt is more widespread in offshore than in onshore UAE and generally occurs within NE-SW to N\u2013S trending basins. The inverted Hormuz salt model has a thickness that ranges from 1000 to 4000\u00a0m, with an average thickness of 2100\u00a0m. Moreover, the model suggests that the Hormuz, Ara (central Oman) and East Rub\u2019 Al Khali (Saudi Arabia) salt basins are most likely connected, except in regions of structural basement highs. In addition, the model reveals a low density (\u22642290\u00a0kg\/m3) shallow layer (0\u20136000\u00a0m below the sea level) in the foreland basin, which corresponds to the Aruma and Pabdeh sequences that infill the foreland basin. Many of the offshore hydrocarbon fields in the UAE such as Zakum, Umm Shaif and Sarb are associated with Hormuz salt domes. Also, several hydrocarbon fields adjoin basement highs, which are possibly related to the flexural bulge caused by the emplacement of the Semail ophiolite on the Arabian continental margin. The basement highs are probably bordered by faults, which could have initiated halokinesis of the Hormuz salt. Thus, the 3D inverted model provides a detailed distribution of Hormuz salt bodies, which allows an improved understanding of Palaeozoic hydrocarbon plays in the UAE.\n               ","93":"\n                  Understanding time-dependent mechanical properties is critical to perform geomechanical risk quantification and reduce the environmental impact of fracking operations. In this study, vitrinite reflectance test, scanning electron microscope (SEM)\/helium ion microscope (HIM) observation, atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoscale dynamic mechanical analysis (AFM-nDMA), and micro-Raman analysis were combined as a chemo-mechanical method to investigate the role of thermal maturation in affecting nanoscale viscoelasticity of organic matter with maceral classification. The results of 208 tested areas demonstrated that viscosity is negatively correlated with thermal maturity, while storage modulus is positively correlated with maturity, suggesting that such polymer-like to mineral-like process might be prone to fracture initiation. Moreover, chemical structure changes during the thermal evolution exhibited by micro-Raman analysis were found to contribute to the abovementioned mechanical variations. Characterization of viscoelasticity of organic matter considering geochemical features is a highly promising aspect for inclusion in petrophysical workflows, leading to improved design of hydraulic fracturing and homogenization modeling.\n               ","94":"\n                  Identifying facies and paleoenvironmental interpretation of the rock record is complicated due to the interplay of independent variables (i.e. wave-, river- and tidal-input) in marginal- and shallow-marine environments. This study integrates sedimentology and ichnology to characterize the depositional environments of the Lower Cretaceous Wabiskaw Member. The deltaic and strand plain shoreface-offshore deposits of Wabiskaw Member of Clearwater Formation of northeast Alberta provide an excellent case study to evaluate the ichnological and sedimentological characteristics associated with laterally and vertically variable stresses in wave-influenced nearshore settings. The Wabiskaw Member is studied using four sedimentary facies associations (Ten sedimentary facies). Facies association 1(FA-1) consists of massive, sharp-based mudstones and lenticular sandstone with small-scale soft-sediment deformation features, syneresis cracks and small-scale oscillation ripples. The ichnological suite mainly includes small grazing and deposit-feeding traces, representing the Phycosiphon Ichnofacies. Facies association 1(FA-1) is interpreted to record deposition in a prodeltaic setting. Facies association 2 (FA-2) is fine-to-medium-grained sandstone and thin mudstone with current, oscillation and combined flow ripples. The low angle and trough cross-beds, soft-sediment deformation structure, mud chips and coal debris are common. The trace fossil suite includes sporadically distributed deposit-feeding traces belonging to the Rosselia Ichnofacies. This facies association is interpreted to be deposited in the delta front to a mouth bar setting. Facies association 3 (FA-3) is gray to bluish-gray mudstone with minor sandstone interbeds (massive, planar parallel to hummocky cross-stratified). FA-3 is moderate to highly bioturbated. The ichnodiversity and abundance is high with dominant horizontal and subordinate vertical traces, including the dominance of deposit and detritus feeding traces representing the archetypal Cruziana Ichnofacies ichnological suite. Facies association 3 (FA-3) is interpreted as being deposited in a storm-influenced offshore environment. Facies association 4 (FA-4) is upper fine to fine-grained glauconitic sandstone with minor mudstone interbeds at the base. Physical sedimentary structures including massive and planar (horizontal and low angle), hummocky, and swaley crossing-stratification. FA-4 is heavily burrowed with a diverse suite of horizontal and vertical traces of deposit and detritus-feeding structures, representing a proximal expression of Cruziana Ichnofacies. Facies association 4 (FA-4) represents distal lower to middle shoreface deposition. The Wabiskaw Member deltaic (prodelta-delta front) deposits, producing characteristic sedimentological-ichnological signatures, distinguishing these deposits from related strand plains. In addition to characteristic deltaic traits (e.g. soft-sediment deformation structures, fluid mud and syneresis cracks), these deposits commonly contain comparably stressed low-diversity and diminutive trace-fossil suites. On the other hand, fully marine strand plain shoreface-offshore complexes are characterized by comparably robust trace fossils with high ichno-diversity and bioturbation intensities.\n               ","95":"\n                  Interpretation of over 100,000 line-km of reprocessed 2D, time-migrated, seismic-reflection data from the U.S. Chukchi shelf documents at least four tectonic events in the last 400 m.y. that generated distinct inherited structures. A well stratified economic basement whose internal geometry clearly defines a pre-Mississippian, thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt represents the earliest recognizable tectonism in the area, one that accommodated west-east (present-day coordinates) shortening, probably in the Devonian. (1) The first inversion event, and dominant crustal feature in the Chukchi shelf, is the Hanna Trough, a north-south, failed rift system that accommodated more than 10\u00a0km of Carboniferous-Jurassic syn-rift and post-rift (sag) strata. Carboniferous extensional collapse of the previous orogenic belt to form the Hanna Trough was influenced heterogeneously by the pre-Mississippian contractional fabrics. Many rift-phase normal faults detach along pre-Mississippian thrust faults in discrete negative inversion, creating distinctive synthetic growth strata that constrain the geometry of extension. Other normal faults cut across pre-Mississippian stratigraphy showing more typical rollover geometries in growth strata and dissection of contractional structures in the pre-rift strata in more distributed negative inversion. (2) After a period of Pennsylvanian to Early Jurassic subsidence, in the south-central Chukchi shelf several north-south, rift-phase normal faults were inverted in a second event in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, forming local, asymmetric, positive inversion structures due to west-east shortening likely associated with far-field effects of the Chukotkan orogeny. The Hanna Trough then was buried beneath >2\u00a0km of Cretaceous and Cenozoic foreland-basin deposits during which complex additional deformation occurred in the region. (3) The North Chukchi high resulted from Late Cretaceous-Paleogene deep thrusting, both south- and north-directed, and possible transpressional inversion across a complex older structural fabric. (4) Cenozoic east-west extension and strike-slip faulting in the northern Hanna Trough reactivated Carboniferous rift structures, in the west as dominantly discrete motion on the older faults, and in the east in more distributed fashion coalescing near older rifts and cutting Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contractional structures during a final negative inversion. Documentation of multi-phase structural inheritance in the Chukchi shelf is vital to unraveling the tectonic history and influences on petroleum systems in the area.\n               ","96":"\n                  Episodic venting from deep overpressured layers has rarely been documented in sedimentary basins, so the pressure evolution leading to these cyclical phenomena is poorly understood at present. Using three-dimensional (3D) seismic data from the West Nile Deep Sea Fan, we interpret >480 fluid escape pipes within a region of prolific leakage across a > 2\u00a0km thick sealing sequence of salt and claystones. Within this region, we map five linear trails of pipes with pockmarks or small mud volcanoes at their outlets and interpret them to have formed by episodic venting of overpressured fluids from beneath the salt, over a \u223c2\u20133 Myr period, coeval with basinward displacement of the pipes by flow of the salt. Importantly, the pipe trails root to the crests of stratigraphic traps at the base of the salt seal. Direct measurements from nearby exploration wells are used to construct pressure-depth and pressure-time plots over the lifetime of the pipe trails and demonstrate that overpressure near to or in excess of the lithostatic pressure must be repeatedly achieved in the stratigraphic traps to breach the salt seal every 50\u2013150 kyrs. This pressure evolution is best described by a sawtooth pattern with overpressure relieved by venting, followed by re-seal of the trap, and pressure recharge. The pressure recharge for this episodic venting can most easily be explained here by biogenic gas generation and aquifer pressure transfer in the traps, with some minor contribution from sustained disequilibrium compaction during the Pliocene to Recent. The conditions necessary for this type of episodic venting should occur more widely, particularly in basins with thick evaporite deposits. The recognition of episodic venting has important implications for prospect de-risking, drilling safety and CO2 and hydrogen storage.\n               ","97":"\n                  The thick succession of Quaternary sediments that is preserved in the northern North Sea provides a valuable record of the climate and environmental changes of the last \u223c2.6 million years. However, the general lack of chronological control on these sediments, combined with gaps in high-resolution seismic data coverage, has hindered our understanding of the detailed sediment infill history of this margin. Here we use a large (35,000\u00a0km2) high-resolution 3D seismic cube, supplemented by other 2D and 3D seismic datasets, to map more than 20 horizons within the Quaternary Naust Formation. We extend these horizons across large parts of the northern North Sea to establish a robust seismic framework that is used to assess the correspondence between existing chronostratigraphic ages. Whereas there is good agreement between most existing ages, the correlation of horizons between the Troll Field and the North Sea trough-mouth fan suggests that the sediments preserved at the base of the Norwegian Channel may have been deposited significantly later than assumed previously. Geomorphological forms preserved close to the base of the Norwegian Channel provide evidence for sediment disturbance by ice-stream activity, and document a two-stage glacial build-up during a mid-Pleistocene glaciation. We suggest a new age model for the Quaternary sediments of the northern North Sea, in which the deposition of sediments within the Norwegian Channel occurred as recently as 0.35\u00a0Ma in response to prior sediment loading and subsidence within the North Sea trough-mouth fan. In addition to providing new insights into the extent and timing of glacial events, the development of a regionally consistent 3D seismic-stratigraphic framework has implications for the age of the Peon gas discovery and for reconstructing spatial and temporal patterns of Quaternary sediment subsidence and fluid overpressure in the North Sea Basin.\n               ","98":"\n                  Diagenetic evolution of sedimentary basins, which is crucial to resource exploration and development, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), is mainly controlled by fluid influx associated with the regional tectonic and hydrogeologic setting of these basins. Therefore, petrographic and isotope geochemical studies integrated with geodynamics of sedimentary basins, fluid flow and transport hydrodynamics are insightful tools to reconstruct the regional history of paleofluid flow and their driving mechanisms. This study investigates carbonate diagenesis in the Lower Triassic Montney Formation of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) to constrain the origin of diagenetic fluids, their major flow systems, and their association with the tectonics and hydrogeology of the WCSB. Petrographic analysis shows various generations of early-to late-stage non-ferroan to ferroan calcite (C1\u2013C3) and dolomite (D1-D4) cement. Bulk \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of carbonate cements range from \u22127.1 to +0.4\u2030 and \u22129.5 to \u22122.8\u2030 (VPDB), respectively, noticeably more depleted than those estimated for Early Triassic seawater. Their 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratio, 0.7108 to 0.7128, is significantly more radiogenic than Early Triassic seawater. These isotopic values confirm the extensive interaction of the Montney Formation pore water with hot basinal brines of Precambrian metasediments and siliciclastic strata, the influx of hydrothermal fluids, and high burial temperature in the basin. The 13C-depleted signature of these cements supports the contribution of organic carbon, from the breakdown and oxidation of organic matter and hydrocarbons via microbial and thermochemical sulfate reduction processes. The results of this study suggest that Montney Formation diagenesis was influenced by evolved Montney pore water interacting with fluids sourced from metasediments of the Cordillera thrust belt and topography-driven fluids from Columbian and Laramide tectonism. This study highlights the importance of an integrated approach to better understand changes in fluid compositions during diagenesis and reconstruction of basin-scale paleofluid flow systems in sedimentary basins.\n               ","99":"\n                  A key parameter when drilling for gas and oil is to determine the safe mud weight window (SMWW) to ensure wellbore stability as part of a quantitative risk assessment (QRA). This study determines SMWW by predicting acceptable upper and lower limits of the bottom hole pressure window during over-balance drilling method. A novel machine learning method is developed to predict SMWW from ten well-log input variables subject to feature selection. 3389 data records from three South Pars gas field (Iran) wells include data from: uncorrected spectral gamma ray; potassium; thorium; uranium; photoelectric absorption factor; neutron porosity; bulk formation density; corrected gamma ray adjusted for uranium content; shear-wave velocity and compressional-wave velocity. Combinations of these well logs are tuned to provide predictions of the SMWW, measured in terms of subsurface pore and fracture pressures, using machine learning (ML) algorithms hybridized with optimizers. The ML algorithms assessed are multiple layer extreme learning machine (MELM) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), hybridized with genetic (GA) and particle swarm (PSO) optimizers. This new algorithm (MELM) incorporates special features that improve its prediction performance, speeds up its training, inhibits overfitting and involves less optimization in the model's construction. By combining MELM with PSO, its optimum control parameters are rapidly determined. The results reveal that the MELM-PSO combination provides the highest SMWW prediction accuracy of four models evaluated. For the testing subset MELM-PSO achieves high prediction performance of pore pressure (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a012.76 psi; R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9948) and fracture pressure (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a015.71 psi; R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9967). Furthermore, the model demonstrates that once trained with data from a few wells, it can be successfully applied to predict unseen data in other South Pars gas field wells. The findings of this study can provide a better understanding of how ML methods can be applied to accurately predict SMWW\n                        .\n                     \n                  \n               ","100":"\n                  The Oligocene Menilite shales (Silesian Unit, Polish Outer Carpathians), an example of the organic-rich black shale facies of the Paratethys, were sampled in the two sections of Znamirowice and Kobielnik, representing proximal to the land and open-marine environments, respectively. Terrestrial organic matter (OM) imprinted in maceral and biomarker composition was probably supplied by the fresh-water runoff, as suggested by the total organic carbon (TOC)\u2013total sulfur (TS) values and low Sr\/Ba ratio in the Znamirowice section. In contrast, normal marine-salinity conditions and the scarcity of higher plant-derived biomarkers or macerals in the Kobielnik section suggest the deposition in a more distal environment.

This research focusses on a debated issue about iron sources for Phanerozoic ooidal ironstone. Siderite, the main cementing mineral in the ironstones, is of two varieties that differ in morphology, chemical and isotopic composition, and types of fluid inclusions. The first variety of siderite occurs either as veinlet or as anhedral cement, consisting of isotopically light carbon and oxygen (\u03b413C from \u221239.5 to \u221229.7\u2030 and \u03b418O from \u221215.2 to \u22125.1\u2030). Fluid inclusions show a relatively high homogenization temperature (170\u2013320\u00a0\u00b0C) and methane in the gas phase, corresponding to methane-bearing hydrothermal fluids. The second variety of siderite occurs as aggregates of small crystals in the ironstone matrix and is relatively enriched in heavier stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (\u03b413C from \u221228.1 to \u221212.2\u2030 and \u03b418O from \u221228.4 to \u22122.1\u2030), suggesting its formation on the seafloor under the combined influence of methane flux and seawater. The zone of the ooidal ironstone most proximal to the most intense ore-mineralization, an area of intense diffusion of metals and methane through marine sediments, is marked by the first variety of siderite, with rare authigenic minerals, a low clay content (kaolinite, chlorite, nontronite) and a high Fe content of the smectites. The authigenic mineral associations reflect the transition from methanic (sulfate-methane transition zone) to ferruginous (iron reduction zone) through sulfidic environment. The intermediate zone is dominated by montmorillonite-illite-saponite-nontronite and the second variety of siderite. The distal zone of the ore deposit is relatively unaltered, and is marked by illite-montmorillonite (illite-smectite), with rare second variety of siderite. The ratio of 1\u00a0M phyllosilicates (kaolinite) to the main swelling 2\u00a0M phyllosilicates in the clay fraction (K\/M mineral index) decreases from the proximal zone of the intense iron-mineralization to the distal zone. The trend of clay mineral changes reflects the decreasing alteration of sediment matrix away from the main iron-rich and\/or carbonate-bearing fluid influx. This study shows the expected lateral and vertical variation in authigenic minerals associated with marine Phanerozoic ironstone deposits, related to variable flux of metal- and methane-bearing fluids.\n               ","102":"\n                  This paper provides the results of lithostratigraphy and depositional environment of the uppermost Silurian through Lower Devonian Winduck Interval section from three areas widely distributed in the central Bancannia Trough from Bancannia South 1 well, the southern Pondie Range Sub-basin from Pondie Range 1 well and the northwestern part of the Blantyre Sub-basin from two wells, the Booligal Creek 1 and 2. These wells were studied using wireline log, core and cutting data to predict sequence stratigraphic architecture and its implication for hydrocarbon sandstone reservoir potential. This study necessitated the use of detailed facies prediction relationships and geometry of lithostratigraphic concepts for the purpose of establishing a sequence stratigraphic architecture framework of the studied areas. Two units were established, lower and upper Winduck Interval, within the Winduck Interval identified by lithological data examination and wireline log characteristics of the sediments from the four wells in the study area. Results of the lithology type analysis showed that the Winduck Interval is interbedded richly in sandstone and siltstone complex deposits. This paper presents a clear picture of the sequence stratigraphic model, as well as that of the three third-order depositional sequences (DS1, DS2 and DS3, respectively) that are identified from changes in systems tracts patterns (composed of lowstand, transgressive and highstand), vertical and lateral facies sequence thickness changes and the lithostratigraphic units distribution in the Winduck Interval section. Potential reservoir prospectivity targets are identified in lowstand system tracts and highstand system tracts deposits consisting of sandstone facies and thin silts, while the transgressive system tracts deposits consist of shales and some interbedded shaly siltstones, many having excellent potential source and seal properties.

However, the influence of the sedimentary environment evolution on its organic matter heterogeneity is still unclear. In this paper, the evolution of the sedimentary environment of the Yogou Formation profile was studied from the aspects of micropaleontology, element geochemistry and biomarkers. A total of three third-order sequences (YSQ1, YSQ2 and YSQ3, from bottom to top) were identified in the Yogou Formation. The distribution of micropaleontology in different sequences indicates that YSQ1 mainly deposited in the marine environment, while, the YSQ2 and YSQ3 mainly deposited in the marine-continental transitional environment. The elemental geochemical analysis shows that the water salinity of YSQ1 was higher than that of YSQ2 and YSQ3. From YSQ1 to YSQ3, the terrestrial input increased, the climate became warmer and wetter, and the reducibility of water generally weakened. The biomarker characteristics and organic geochemical parameters indicate that the YSQ1 generally deposited in a sub-anoxic to anoxic environment, while the YSQ3 deposited in the environment frequently alternating from reduction to oxidation, and the reducing environment may provide a good preservation condition for the enrichment organic matters. The abundant terrigenous materials input and good preservation conditions may be the basic reason to form the mudstone with high TOC content in the upper member of the Yogou Formation. The same micropaleontological species found in the Termit Basin, Benue Trough and Bornu Basin provide evidence for the hypothesis that there was a trans-Saharan seaway between the Tethys Sea and the South Atlantic during the Cenomanian and Turonian transgressions.

The absence of an underlying seal-bypass system such as pipes and faults associated with these paleo-pockmarks discounts a deeper thermogenic source or a potential magmatic-driven fluid system. Rather a biogenic fluid system derived from the degradation of organic-rich layers and pore water expelled during early-stage compaction is hypothesised to drive paleo-pockmark formation.

For this purpose and in order to better understand reservoir quality, porosity and permeability in combination with point-counted petrographic data of sandstones from SW Germany covering the Lower, Middle, and Upper Buntsandstein are studied. Textural, mineralogical, and petrophysical data show that the eolian and fluvial sandstones represent a heterogeneous reservoir system. Permeabilities vary over six orders of magnitude from 0.001 to 515 mD, while porosities are in the range of 7.9\u201321.5%. Different controls on reservoir quality exist. Large grain sizes \u22650.31\u00a0mm together with total quartz contents are the major controls on reservoir quality. Additional controls on reservoir quality are exerted by authigenic phases. Since porosity loss is dominated by compaction, the influence of authigenic clay phases on reservoir quality is minor. However, illite coatings on detrital quartz efficiently inhibited syntaxial quartz overgrowth. Where illite coatings lack, syntaxial quartz overgrowths locally stabilized the granular framework and, thus, preserved primary porosity. These authigenic phases, however, represent a local control, which cannot be applied on a regional scale. Similarly, enhanced secondary porosity due to feldspar dissolution is locally restricted and minor. The comparison with other studies on the Buntsandstein shows that its reservoir system is highly heterogeneous over small and large scales and within the same stratigraphic levels.

In particular, the early Zanclean reflooding that postdated the Messinian Salinity Crisis, was followed by the SW-ward progradation of a highstand to forced regressive shelf-slope system (Sequence 1). Forced regression was controlled by a main episode of tectonic uplift that occurred at the end of the Zanclean.

The lower part of Sequence 2 (Piacenzian to late Pleistocene) recorded a two-step subsidence phase, which led to drowning episodes during Piacenzian and in particular late Gelasian (transgressive systems tract of Sequence 2). They were associated with the partial flooding of the TFM and the Miocene deposits overlying the FDPC, and with a downward bending of the pre-Calabrian succession toward the Apennine chain. The accommodation created during the late Gelasian drowning event was filled in part by an Alpine-sourced, SW-ward prograding system, and in part by the NE-ward paleo-Po prograding system (highstand systems tract of Sequence 2). The most recent part of Sequence 2 documents the last glacio-eustatic cycles in a physiographic context characterized by a very low gradient.\n               ","108":"\n                  Eight sediment multi-cores samples collected from the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea were examined to evaluate organic matter (OM) sources to the marine setting for a large sediment and carbon sink. Total organic carbon (TOC) for sediments from the northern Bay of Bengal (NBB), eastern Bay of Bengal (EBB) and the northern Andaman Sea (NAS) range from 0.34 to 0.79\u00a0wt%, 0.84 to 1.06\u00a0wt%, and 0.20 to 1.18\u00a0wt%, respectively, with higher concentrations in fine silts than in the sandy fractions suggesting hydrodynamic sorting and surface area control TOC. The TOC to total nitrogen (TN) ratio (C\/N) (NBB: 5.31\u20138.52; EBB: 5.51\u20136.97; NAS: 6.44\u201311.92) indicates OM is a mixture of dominant contributions from marine plankton and lesser contributions from land plants. The organic carbon (\u03b413Corg) isotopic values display a similar range of values in each of the regions of the NBB (\u221212.0 to \u221219.9\u2030), EBB (\u221210.1 to \u221220.2\u2030) and NAS (\u22128.3 to \u221220.3\u2030). \u03b413Corg values may derive from marine phytoplankton, terrestrial C4 plants and\/or aquatic macrophytes. The total nitrogen (\u03b415N) isotopic compositions (NBB: 3.7\u20134.1; EBB: 4.1\u20135.9; NAS: 4.2\u20136.5\u2030) diagnose input from planktonic sources or aquatic macrophytes. Hydrocarbons from the sediments have a bimodal distribution with high relative abundance of mid-chain n-alkanes (C23 and C25 peaks) and long-chain n-alkanes (C29 and C31). Average chain length (ACL25-35), carbon preference index (CPI25-35), and grassland (P\n                     grass) ratios suggest contributions from terrestrial vegetation including grasses. High TOC to total sulphur (TS) ratios (C\/S) observed suggest well-oxygenated interval associated with vertical mixing of seawater about 1000 years ago. The average sedimentation rates of Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea are about 0.4\u00a0mm yr\u22121 and 0.07\u00a0mm yr\u22121, respectively. The organic carbon accumulation rate of the Bay of Bengal is found to be several times higher than that of Andaman Sea. Rapid deposition of both marine and terrestrial OM in the Bay of Bengal could be a favourable sedimentary system for methane fermentation to form methane hydrate in this regime.\n               ","109":"\n                  The turbidite sandstone of the Agat Formation is one of the most important hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Lower Cretaceous succession of the Norwegian North Sea. The diagenetic history of these sandstones has greatly impacted the reservoir quality, resulting in a high heterogeneity in porosity and permeability. To investigate this impact, sixty thin sections and rock samples were investigated through petrographic observations, geochemical microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. Three main diagenetic events occurred during burial and influenced the reservoir properties: (1) mutual growth of chlorite, siderite, and apatite, (2) calcite cementation, and (3) dissolution of K-feldspar and calcite. Early diagenesis occurs under strongly reducing conditions, leading to the formation of Fe-chlorite\/berthierine, siderite, pyrite, and apatite forming coatings around the detrital grains. Chlorite coatings have a key role in controlling the reservoir quality in the Agat Formation. In the lower part of the reservoir, chlorite forms thick coats (15\u201325\u00a0\u03bcm) that strongly reduce permeability. Conversely, in the upper part of the reservoir, chlorite coats are thinner (4\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm), favoring porosity preservation by inhibiting quartz overgrowth. X-ray diffraction and electron microscope observations indicate Fe-rich chlorite of Ib polytype, suggesting solid-state transformation from a berthierine precursor. The kinetics of berthierine\/chlorite growth are governed by the dissolution of Fe-rich grains and fine fraction materials found as matrix and early coats. These grains are abundant in the lower part of the reservoir favoring the formation of thick chlorite coats. Chlorite was followed by pervasive calcite cementation in deep burial conditions creating low permeability barriers in the reservoir. The source of this calcite is internal and probably related to the dissolution of an early diagenetic calcite cement forming at shallow depth, with a minor contribution from marine carbonates. During late diagenesis, K-feldspar grains and calcite cements underwent intense dissolution creating secondary porosity and consequently increasing permeability. The input of acidic fluids associated with the maturation of the source rocks could have facilitated these dissolution reactions. Our results highlight the importance of inherited mineralogy in controlling the distribution of chlorite, carbonates, and secondary porosity in the Agat Formation. This study provides useful indicators to help predict diagenetic reactions that can occur in deep marine siliciclastic reservoirs.\n               ","110":"\n                  The along-strike variation of fault-related inversion folds within curved thrust systems is documented by presenting cases from the Central-Northern Apennines of Italy. Fold structures are reconstructed by integrating geological field data and structural restoration of various key balanced cross-sections, which are also constrained by the detailed interpretation of panoramic views, geological field mapping, and structural analysis. The lateral variation from fault-bend to fault-propagation folding is promoted by selective reverse reactivation of precursor, mainly rift-related, normal faults preferentially located along the oblique and frontal ramps. Their space variability is identified within single curved thrust systems of three different size testifying a scale-invariant phenomenon. Fault-bend reactivation and fault-propagation shortcut folding produce a characteristic fold interference pattern at the salient apex of the curved thrust system. The transition style depends on the pattern of the inherited normal fault template and on the amount of shortening achieved in the salient zone. The modest amount of shortening resulting from fault-related inversion folding along regional curved thrust systems is consistent with a basement-involved thick-skinned thrusting style. Recognition of fault-related inversion fold styles and of their along-strike variations represents a useful predictive tool when unravelling the kinematic evolution of curved orogenic belts resulting from positive inversion. Inversion fold development modes and their diagnostic features are also important for investigations of subsurface Earth resources.\n               ","111":"\n                  Shale oil exploration and development have been conducted in the Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin.

In order to clarify the enrichment law of shale oil for these members, the geological conditions of the P2\n                     l\n                     2 and P2\n                     l\n                     1 members were analyzed. The focus of this study were oil-bearing sandstone and mudstone samples from the Lucaogou Formation. These samples were studied by casting thin section observation, total organic carbon, pyrolysis, and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. The results showed that the upper and lower members of the Lucaogou Formation are mainly characterized as interbedded source rock and reservoir. An oil-source correlation showed that the crude oil in the upper member mainly originated from its adjacent source rock from a deeper position through secondary migration. However, no evidence of secondary migration was observed in the crude oil in the lower member which mainly originated from the adjacent source rock. For the sandbodies in the upper member, when burial is shallower than peak oil generation, the physical properties of the middle part of the sandbody are better than the top and bottom. When burial is deeper than peak oil generation, relatively good physical properties developed in the sandstone in the vicinity the source rock. The lower member has less reservoir thickness, poorer lateral continuity and horizontal permeability than the upper member. The high-quality reservoirs are represented in a single sandbody in the lower member that is mainly developed in the middle part. After the crude oil was discharged from the source rock enters the sandbody, and long-distance lateral migration was restricted. Thus, crude oil in the lower member is enriched and accumulated in situ.\n               ","112":"\n                  Petroleum reserves are abundant in the large-scale lacustrine fan delta reservoirs containing mixed oil in the Baikouquan Formation (MA131 Block, Junggar Basin). However, detecting such subtle reservoirs in the lacustrine foreland basins is challenging. High-resolution sequence stratigraphy, sedimentary basin evolution, and reservoir models are established by integrating the results obtained via wireline log data, cores, thin sections, and seismic data. A fifth-order sequence stratigraphic framework for the Baikouquan Formation is established, which enables the reconstruction of the sedimentary basin evolution and further detailing of the reservoir model, such that the correlation to multistage progradation and retrogradation of the fan delta complex can be determined. The study of core samples led to the identification of eight microfacies, of which sandy debris flows and distributary channels dominate approximately 80% of the depositional system. Stratal slices enable the characterization of the northern Xiazijie and eastern Madong fan-delta systems. The northern Xiazijie fan delta is widely distributed throughout sequences SSQ1\u2013SSQ6, whereas the Xiazijie fan delta underwent, in general, gradual retrogradation during the formation of sequences SSQ6 and SSQ7. The eastern Madong gravity flow fan-delta system only developed during the formation of sequences SSQ1\u2013SSQ5 at the location of an abrupt slope break. There are nine categories of reservoir models in the study area based on the source rocks, faults, and reservoirs. Geomorphology and climate are crucial in controlling the sedimentary infill. Deep faults and an unconformity between the Permian and the Triassic of the Mahu Sag played a decisive role in controlling the hydrocarbon migration pathways. The faults, source rocks, and microfacies together exert considerable control on hydrocarbon accumulation. Within the nearshore fan-delta front, variable reservoir quality can be observed. Crucial factors in improving reservoir quality are fine-grain size and relatively low clay content. This study may facilitate subtle reservoir characterization in other basins.\n               ","113":"\n                  Over the last few years, recognition and characterization of sedimentary processes in fine-grained successions is receiving considerable attention in part due to the increased importance of unconventional reservoirs. Recent sedimentologic analyses of these successions have revealed abundant traction transport structures that suggest bottom current activity of different origins. The present study constitutes a detailed sedimentologic analysis of the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Vaca Muerta Formation (Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina), which comprises organic-rich, fine-grained subaqueous clinoform deposits. Locally, intervals showing traction structures such as parallel lamination, ripple cross-lamination and cross-bedding, and displaying high bioturbation, occur. These intervals can be differentiated into three facies associations, namely crinoidal mixed to calcareous mudstone, mixed to calcareous mudstone, and calcareous to mixed mudstone interbedded with calcareous mudstone. These facies associations were deposited by contour currents showing semi-permanent activity, low sediment concentration, and generating long-term oxygen supply to the seafloor. Locally, some successions display an increasing to decreasing bioturbation intensity pattern that may have a similar origin to the bi-gradational sequence of contourites. The present sedimentologic analysis supports the idea that contour currents are associated with high bioturbation levels due to increased oxygenation, which controls the degree of preservation of traction structures, and consequently the possibility to delineate these processes in fine-grained successions. These currents occurred in relatively shallow water, probably as part of a weakened estuarine or anti-estuarine, basin-wide circulation system intensified by the enhanced action of dense water cascading during arid and cool climate periods.\n               ","114":"\n                  Aromatic hydrocarbons in 36 shales from the late Miocene-early Pliocene strata of the Yinggehai Basin in the South China Sea were investigated. Various higher plant-derived aromatic hydrocarbons were identified, including cadalene, retene, 1,2,7-trimethylnaphthalene, 1-methylphenanthrene (MP), 1,7-dimethylphenanthrene (DMP), 6-isopropyl-1-isohexyl-2-methylnaphthalene, and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Higher plant parameters suggest that the relative abundance of terrigenous organic matter in the early Pliocene was lower than in the angiosperm-dominated late Miocene Huangliu Formation. Various plant parameters including retene\/(retene\u00a0+\u00a0cadalene), 1-MP\/9-MP, 1,7-DMP\/(1,3-\u00a0+\u00a03,9-\u00a0+\u00a02,10\u00a0+\u00a03,10-DMP), and the higher plant index, indicate that gymnosperms made a larger contribution to the organic matter when the lower Yinggehai Formation was deposited during the early Pliocene. Combustion-derived PAHs, including fluoranthene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzofluoranthenes and coronene, predominate over petrogenic PAHs in the lower Yinggehai Formation and the upper Meishan Formation, indicating that there were more wildfires during deposition of these units compared to the Huangliu Formation. In contrast, there is a mixed input of combustion-derived and petrogenic PAHs in the Huangliu Formation. As also supported by higher abundances of Pinus in palynological records, the combustion-derived PAHs and the gymnosperm\/angiosperm parameters provide unequivocal evidence for a cooling climate from the late Miocene to the early Pliocene in the South China Sea.\n               ","115":"\n                  As a major boundary between the Simao-Indochina and South China blocks, the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan\u2013Song Ma suture zone preserves the remnants of a back-arc basin or a branch of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. However, whether this suture zone extends eastward to the Hainan Island is still controversial. Here, we use detrital zircon U\u2013Pb geochronology to explore the source-to-sink characteristics of the Lower Carboniferous-Lower Permian strata in Hainan Island and mainland southeast China (SE China). The results, combined with published data for the Devonian-Triassic sandstones from Hainan and SE China, show that the Devonian-Lower Permian samples display similar detrital zircon age populations at \u223c430\u00a0Ma, \u223c930\u2013980\u00a0Ma, \u223c1600\u20131800\u00a0Ma and \u223c2400\u00a0Ma. However, the Upper Permian-Triassic sandstones have a predominant zircon population at \u223c370\u00a0Ma, indicating a dramatic change in the detritus provenance for Hainan-SE China since the early Late Permian. The presence of similar 400-350\u00a0Ma detrital zircons peaked at \u223c370\u00a0Ma with \u03f5Hf(t) values from \u221212 to +3 in the sedimentary rocks from both Hainan-SE China and Simao-Indochina blocks indicates that these two terranes should have a similar detritus source with abundant Late Devonian magmatic rock exposure during the Late Permian-Triassic. These Late Devonian magmatic rocks were most likely formed by the north-dipping Paleotethyan subduction. This conclusion is consistent with the recent discovery of Upper Devonian arc-related tuffs, volcaniclastics, tuffaceous chert and rhyolite in the North Qiangtang, Simao-Indochina and East Malaya terranes, and possibly also in the southern Hainan. These Upper Devonian rocks could have acted as detritus source for the basins in SE China-Hainan, as well as the Youjiang Basin in SW China, after the collision between the Indochina and South China blocks. Combined with the transition from a carbonate platform to clastic facies in the early Late Permian in SE China, the Indochina-South China collision on Hainan Island may have occurred at \u223c266-260\u00a0Ma, earlier than that (\u223c250-230\u00a0Ma) along the Jinshajiang\u2013Ailaoshan\u2013Song Ma suture zone. Such a temporal\u2013spatial source-to-sink relationship between the Late Devonian arc and basins on the southern margin of South China suggests that SE China-Hainan should be located within the Paleo-Tethys rather than the Paleo-Pacific tectonic domain during the Early Carboniferous-early Late Permian.\n               ","116":"\n                  The characterization of porosity is an essential step in the evaluation of resource-bearing porous media. Here, we focus on the Devonian Hare Indian and Canol Formations, two potential unconventional mudstone reservoirs, in a core from the Horn River Group of the Central Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories, Canada. By combining bulk porosity, low-pressure N2 adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results with composition and lithofacies datasets, we assess the porosity in these successions to understand pore types, size, distribution, degree of connectivity, and controls and predictors of porosity. Mineral matrix pores (interparticle and intraparticle), organic matter pores, and lithofacies-dependant natural fractures are present. All pore types display limited connectivity in two dimensions. Mineralogy is the most significant control on porosity with trends in porosity present among lithofacies. No relationship is observed between porosity and total organic carbon (TOC), suggesting that mineral matrix pores, rather than organic matter pores, are dominant in this unit. We compare these results to other mudstone reservoirs in North America and show that the Bluefish Member (Hare Indian Formation) and the Canol Formation are characterized by comparable bulk porosity, lower N2 mesopore volume, and higher quartz content relative to the other units considered. In contrast, compared to the other unconventional reservoir examples, the Bell Creek Member of the Hare Indian Formation exhibits lower quartz and higher clay content, average bulk porosity, and lower N2 pore volume. The results collectively suggest that high quartz and low clay content are the best predictors of porosity in the Horn River Group. Natural fractures may serve as flow pathways to induced fractures; however, these units lack the network of interconnected organic matter pores that can be present in other successions.\n               ","117":"\n                  Hydrocarbon gas is a significant type of clean energy, and understanding its carbon-hydrogen (C\u2013H) isotopic behaviour during hydrocarbon generation is essential for determining the gas genesis.

Formation water is a type of ubiquitous saline water in oilfields, whereas not commonly utilized in hydrous pyrolysis. To determine the influence of formation water on C\u2013H isotopic systematics of hydrocarbon gas (methane, ethane and propane), two series of semi-closed hydrous pyrolysis experiments were conducted in 275\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C for the type I Green River Shale source rock using distilled water and formation water. Hydrocarbon gases generated in two series of experiments have similar \u03b413C ratios yet slightly different \u03b4D ratios at individual temperatures, which is likely attributed to the water-organic interaction as formation water has a different \u03b4D ratio compared to distilled water. The \u03b413C and \u03b4D ratios of gas increase with the rising of thermal maturity level, and exhibit quadratic correlations with vitrinite reflectance (VR) values in both series of experiments. The presence of supercritical water in hydrous pyrolysis does not significantly affect the gas C\u2013H isotopic partitioning behaviour because gases collected below and above the critical temperature (374.2\u00a0\u00b0C) display consistent \u03b413C (\u03b4D)-VR patterns.

Extensive research has demonstrated remarkable fluctuations in ocean chemistry, microbial ecosystems, and biogeochemical elemental cycles experienced. However, the spatial-temporal evaluation of marine primary productivity and its links to organic matter accumulation during this key period remain elusive. Here, we present high-resolution marine primary productivity proxy (organic carbon accumulation rates: OCAR) and geochemical data from the Fengtonggang and Qiliao sections deposited in South China and adopted numerous other coeval sections of geochemical data globally, to improve the understanding of these fundamental scientific questions. The results show that all statistical profiles presented broadly high marine primary productivity before and after the Hirnantian glaciation maximum and low values during the glaciation, and a maximum marine primary productivity typically recorded at the uppermost part of the P.pacificus Zone. The Corg\/Ptotal ratios indicate that oceanic anoxia was ubiquitous during the Late Katian to Early Rhuddanian, but strong spatial heterogeneous during the Hirnantian glaciation maximum. The volcanism and nitrogen availability may have played an important role in regulating the variations of marine primary productivity globally. Besides, redox-controlled phosphorus cycling may have also exerted a remarkable influence on marine primary productivity. The high Corg\/Ptotal ratios (exceed the Redfield ratio of 106\/1) observed in the Wufeng and Longmaxi formations indicate that phosphorus was recycled effectively back to the water column, promoting a positive productivity feedback. By contrast, the low Corg\/Ptotal ratios found in the Guanyinqiao Bed reflect phosphorus retention in the sediment, limiting phosphorus recycling back to the water column, consequently restricting the primary production. The enhanced marine primary productivity resulted from nutrient regeneration, ocean anoxia, and high sea level may have led to high organic carbon export and preservation. The consistency between the highest marine primary productivity and the first pulse of mass extinction suggests that eutrophication-induced marine anoxia may have played an essential killing mechanism during the first Late Ordovician mass extinction.\n               ","119":"\n                  Methane-related authigenic carbonates play a significant role in the marine carbon cycle and atmospheric CH4 budget.

Mineralogical composition, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, major and trace element contents, and three-dimensional internal structure have been analyzed.\n                  Based on the results obtained, four types of carbonate are identified. The first type recorded decreasing content of rare earth elements plus yttrium (REEY) and increasing carbonate porosity. This is attributed to the gradual increase in methane flux intensity, raising the rate of carbonate deposition and thus reducing the time for elemental uptake. The second type of carbonate displays the same \u03b418O values as the theoretical equilibrium results, the maximum REEY contents, and the densely cemented carbonate structure, indicating a reduction in gas hydrate decomposition. The third type of carbonate formation occurring at the sediment-water interface shows a synchronous and significant enrichment of Mo, V, and Cd contents, suggesting the high hydrogen sulfide flux, which is subject to intensive methane flux and sulfate reduction. The fourth type is the late infill aragonite, which exhibits lower elemental contents compared to early cement due to less exposure to host sediments, while the difference in \u03b418O and \u03b413C values is not significant. The compilation of (Tb\/Yb)N and Y\/Ho ratios of cold-seep carbonates worldwide suggests that the methane flux could alter the space of redox zones (e.g. Fe reduction zone) and thus affect the sink of MREE.\n                  X-ray computed tomography (CT) reveals the internal structure of the methane-related carbonate. The continuous pore system probably suggests an intense fluid\/gas pressure, and the in situ brecciations imply the carbonate precipitation did not entirely block the methane release to the water column.

The sedimentary packages were deposited when the Barents Sea experienced a major change in depositional style at the transition from the Triassic to the Jurassic (Bergan and Knarud, 1993; Worsley, 2008; Ryseth, 2014; Klausen et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2019). A shallow, rapid subsiding epicontinental basin that characterized the area in the Triassic was inverted during the transition to the Jurassic and resulted in a regional low-accommodation setting with local uplift, erosion and non-deposition (Klausen et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2019). This transition from a high to a low accommodation had a major impact on the basin infill dynamics and the reservoir development, but remain enigmatic due to the condensed nature of the succession.\nThe temporal and spatial evolution of sedimentary basins are often obscured by subtle but important gaps in the rock record (Sadler, 1981, 1999; Miall, 2015), and this is especially the case for condensed strata such as the Realgrunnen Subgroup. The chance of preservation is small, and the stratigraphic records are better viewed as \u201cfrozen accidents\u201d of accumulation. Commonly, only a fraction of time is represented in the stratigraphic record (Crampton et al., 2006; Miall, 2015). In subsurface datasets it is complicated to identify unconformities and important shifts in deposition. The low resolution of conventional seismic and absence of wells often obscures our understanding of the stratigraphic units fragmentary development in the subsurface.\nIn this study we have used high-quality conventional subsurface datasets, including 2D and 3D seismic, well log and core data in addition to unique high-frequency P-Cable 3D seismic in a cross-disciplinary effort to understand the controlling factors on reservoir distribution and quality within the condensed Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic Realgrunnen Subgroup in the Hoop Area. To do so, the present study aims to: 1) describe the tectonostratigraphic development of the Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic succession, 2) evaluate the succession in light of changes in the source to sink dynamics and basin subsidence, and 3) while many studies have emphasized the importance of diagenetic evolution, climate and sedimentary processes (Bj\u00f8rlykke and Jahren, 2012), this study will investigate how different phases of erosion\/non-deposition and accumulation in low accommodation settings influence the petrographic character of the sedimentary succession and their reservoir quality.\n\n1.1\nRegional framework\nThe Barents Sea has undergone several major changes in the basin infill history related to major tectonic events which are characterized by important sequence boundary surfaces. One of these surfaces occur at the Permian-Triassic boundary with a shift from mainly aggrading carbonate or silica deposits to large scale prograding siliciclastic wedges in the Triassic. The Triassic systems are primarily sourced from the Uralides and Fennoscandia, which prograded into a subsiding Barents Sea basin (Riis et al., 2008; H\u00f8y and Lundschien, 2011; Gilmullina et al., 2021; Klausen et al., 2022 in press). Basin fill is characterized by a series normal regressive delta systems separated by intermittent periods of transgression (van Yperen et al., 2020; Skjold et al., 1998; Gl\u00f8rstad-Clark et al., 2010; Klausen et al., 2015; Gilmullina et al., 2021) throughout the Induan to Early Norian which consists of the Havert, Klappmyss, Kobbe and Snadd formations (Fig. 1\n).\nThe Realgrunnen Subgroup is subdivided from below; the Fruholmen, Tub\u00e5en, Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations (Fig. 2\n). The lithostratigraphic boundaries are clearly defined by regionally correlative surfaces in the Southwestern Barents Sea (Henriksen et al., 2011). One of these surfaces are seen at the base of the Fruholmen Formation which is a prominent and mappable seismic reflector in the Barents Sea. At the onshore equivalent in Svalbard, the base of Flatsalen Formation is as well easily picked up in outcrops (Lord et al., 2019). The base of Fruholmen Formation coincides with the pan Arctic Norian Flooding (Embry, 1997).\nThe lowermost part of the Norian to Rhaetian Fruholmen Formation is subdivided into three members, from below: the prodeltaic to offshore marine mudstones of the Akkar Member, followed by the fluvio-deltaic sandstones and floodplain\/tidal flat mudstones deposits of the Reke Member and finally the heterolithic Krabbe Member, deposited within a deltaic depositional environment (Fig. 2) (Gjelberg et al., 1987; Klausen et al., 2019; Mendoza et al., 2019).\nDuring the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, large areas of the Barents Sea including Spitsbergen were uplifted (M\u00fcller et al., 2019; Olaussen et al., 2018; Smelror et al., 2009), and the underlying Fruholmen Formation and older Triassic sediments were eroded (e.g. Hoop Area, Fedynsky High, Bjarmeland Platform). The boundary between the Fruholmen and the overlying formations is diachronous and characterized by a subaerial unconformity. Fluvial incisions are seen between the Fruholmen and Tub\u00e5en formations in the Hammerfest Basin (Gjelberg et al., 1987). However, most of the platform areas and internal highs on the Barents Shelf were mainly denudated with a few exceptions with thin remnants in parts of the Bjarmeland Platform.\nWhile most of the Barents Shelf was denudated, the Tub\u00e5en Formation (late Rhaetian-Hettangian) was deposited mainly within the Troms\u00f8, Hammerfest and Nordkapp basins (Klausen et al., 2019). Deposition took place within fluvial channel systems and estuaries. The Tub\u00e5en Formation is also present as a thin unit in parts of the Bjarmeland Platform. A prominent flooding surface on top of the Tub\u00e5en Formation, led to the deposition of tidally influenced deltas and coastal plains of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian Nordmela Formation (Olaussen et al., 1984; Gjelberg et al., 1987; Klausen et al., 2019). The Nordmela Formation is only partly present on the Bjarmeland Platform, while it is represented by thick units in other areas of the SW Barents Sea (Olaussen et al., 1984; Gjelberg et al., 1987). The late Pliensbachian to Bajocian St\u00f8 Formation is present in almost all the wells in the Barents Sea, which primarily consists of nearshore and inner shelf facies. Multiple hiatuses are observed in this interval, implying a complex interplay between tectonics and relative sea level changes. Particularly on platform areas such as the Bjarmeland platform, the rate of subsidence was low, which resulted in the highly amalgamated and condensed sandstones of the Lower to Middle Jurassic succession (Ryseth, 2014; M\u00fcller et al., 2019).\nThe initiation of the extensional phase of the Northeast Atlantic rift system is represented by the regional unconformity between the St\u00f8 and Fuglen formations in the Bajocian\/early Bathonian (Faleide et al., 1993). The Barents Sea was flooded, and the silty mudstone unit of the Bathonian to Callovian Fuglen Formation was deposited, which was later followed by the prolific oil-prone organic rich mudstone of the Oxfordian to Berriasian Hekkingen Formation.\n\n\n\n2\nData and methods\n\n2.1\nWell data\nEight exploration wells are used in this study, including 7324\/8-1, 7324\/8-2,7324\/7-2, 7324\/2-1, 73,251-1, 7324\/9-1, 7324\/10-1 and 7325\/4-1 (Fig. 1). All available core material has been described and correlated. Biostratigraphy is used to constrain relative ages, paleoenviroment and degree of reworking of the strata in the studied wells. The age of sandstone dominated successions such as the St\u00f8 Formation is in some of the wells uncertain due to the low number of microfossils, spores and pollen typically recovered from sandstones. Sandstones are on the other hand studied for mineralogy in the various formations and are analysed by XRD-, thin section- and SEM-analysis, providing information about petrography, provenance and reworking.\n\n\n2.2\nSeismic data\nThe seismic data applied is P-Cable seismic data which includes both 2D wide-azimuth (HR14_2D_HFC and HR15_2D_BS) and 3D-data (HR14_3D) data. These high-resolution data were necessary for interpreting the most important seismic horizons within the condensed Realgrunnen Subgroup. P-Cable seismic data is characterized by short source and receiver distance and very high frequencies compared to conventional seismic data, with very high resolution (down to 1.5\u00a0m vertical resolution) above the first sea-floor multiple (Planke and Berndt, 2002). In addition, the TGS Hoop 3D survey from 2011, which is normal polarity broadband was utilized to interpret the key horizons at a more regional scale. See Faleide et al. (2019, 2021) and Corseri et al. (2018) for a more comprehensive description of the resolution and data comparison of conventional and high-resolution data in the study area.\nBoth the Hoop 3D and the P-Cable data are tied to synthetic seismograms generated from the wells in the area and used to tie the seismic reflectors to the stratigraphic units. Combined with the P-Cable data, well ties provide a very high-resolution regional stratigraphic framework in the Hoop Area (Fig. 3\n\n) within which four key horizons of the Upper Triassic to Jurassic interval are interpreted (Table 1\n). Seismic facies interpretation and horizon attribute analyses were conducted in parallel with the horizon interpretations using Petrel and SMT Kingdom suite software.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nStratigraphy and facies of the Realgrunnen Subgroup\nThe Realgrunnen Subgroup in the Hoop Area comprise the Fruholmen, Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations. The Tub\u00e5en Formation is absent (Fig. 2). Results from our investigation of the succession are reported from oldest to youngest formation.\n\n\n3.2\nFruholmen Formation (Norian-Rhaetian)\nThe Fruholmen Formation varies in thickness between 25 and 105\u00a0m in the Hoop Area (Fig. 3). The mudstone dominated Akkar Member is present in all wells, and is composed of prodeltaic, coarsening upward deposits. The overlying fluvio-deltaic Reke Member is not present in several wells, such as 7324\/10-1, 7325\/1-1 and 7324\/2-1. In wells around the Wisting Field (e.g. 7324\/8-1), the Reke Member is present with several thick intervals composed of up to 10\u201315\u00a0m thick tidally influenced fluvial distributary channel sandstones, interbedded with fine-grained and heterolithic tidally influenced bay deposits. The Krabbe Member is not present in any of the investigated wells (Figs. 3 and 5\n). The thickness of the Fruholmen Formation in the Hoop Area and the Bjarmeland Platform is considerable thinner than in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (e.g. 7321\/8-1), Hammerfest Basin and towards the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Zone (e.g. well 7220\/8-1). For example, in the Johan Castberg Area, it can reach up to 600\u00a0m (e.g 7220\/8-1).\nThe sandstones of the Fruholmen Formation in the Hoop Area classify mostly as sub-arkoses to lithic sub-arkoses (Fig. 6\n). This contrasts the lithic arenites which characterize the underlying Triassic formations (Line et al., 2020). In addition, some intervals in 7324\/9-1 classify as sublitharenites. The porosity of these moderate-to well-sorted sandstones ranges from 3 to 29%, but with low to moderate permeabilities (Fig. 6). The Reke Member in the Hoop Area also holds the first documented occurrence of recycled quartz grains recorded in the basin, which has been interpreted to be derived from an extrabasinal provenance terrain in the east that consisted of consolidated and uplifted Triassic strata (Haile et al., 2020).\nZircon-analysis of the Fruholmen Formation in the Hoop Area indicate mainly a Uralide\/Novaya Zemlya origin (Klausen et al., 2017), and that the Fruholmen Formation was part of a large-scale system prograding towards the NW, following the same depositional trends as the underlying Snadd Formation (Klausen et al., 2019). Zircon grains as young as 215\u00a0Ma (Early Norian age) in well 7324\/8-1 suggest that the eastern provenance areas continued to contribute sediments to the western Barents Sea, although input of older material, likely derived from the Caledonides in Fennoscandia, was also recorded in these studies.\n\n\n3.3\nTub\u00e5en Formation (Rhaetian to Hettangian)\nAs in the terraces and internal basin highs in southwestern Barents Sea, the Tub\u00e5en Formation is not encountered in the Hoop Area. In surrounding basins such as the Hammerfest, Troms\u00f8 and Nordkapp basins, the Tub\u00e5en Formation is composed of up to 140\u00a0m thick coarse grained multistorey fluvial channelized unit with a high sand\/shale ratio (Klausen et al., 2019), (Fig. 5). In the Hoop Area, the Tub\u00e5en Formation is missing, and its coeval hiatus represent a considerable gap in the rock record.\n\n\n3.4\nNordmela Formation (Sinemurian to Pliensbachian)\nThe Nordmela Formation is absent or only seen as thin (1\u20137\u00a0m) unit unconformably overlying the Norian Fruholmen Formation in wells 7324\/7-2, 7324\/8-1, 7324\/9-1 and 7325\/4-1 in the Hoop Area (Figs. 2\u20134). It is composed of mainly sand-rich fluvio-deltaic to shallow marine deposits (Fig. 4). Biostratigraphic analyses show that only the late Pliensbachian part of the formation is preserved. This suggests either an erosional remnant or non-deposition (lacuna) in the early stages of the formation. The hiatus between the Fruholmen and Nordmela formations is roughly estimated to be c. 30 Ma (Fig. 5). Due to the thin nature of the formation, it has not been possible to define any trends in the facies belts. As for the Fruholmen Formation, the Nordmela Formation is very thin in the Hoop Area compared to the thicknesses in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Zone and Hammerfest Basin, where it can reach up to 160\u00a0m.\nThe presence of reworked Triassic spores and pollen suggest reworking of the underlying Triassic successions, which is further substantiated by detrital zircon age signatures in the Jurassic that closely resemble the geochronological character of the Triassic strata in the Hoop Area (Klausen et al., 2017). A reworked origin is also supported by petrographic data, where the sub-litharenitic and quartz arenites in Nordmela Formation contains a large portion of similar-sized grains as the underlying substrate, although being significantly more quartz-dominated than the Fruholmen Formation (Fig. 6). At moderate burial depths, the Nordmela Formation exhibit excellent reservoir properties (Klausen et al., 2019) with up to 30% porosity and high permeability (Fig. 6).\n\n\n3.5\nSt\u00f8 Formation (Toarcian to Bathonian)\nThe St\u00f8 Formation is encountered in almost all the exploration wells in the Barents Sea, including the Hoop Area, reflecting its overall transgressive nature and the culmination of sandstone deposition of the Lower and Middle Jurassic succession of the Realgrunnen Subgroup. As for the underlying formations in the Realgrunnen Subgroup, the St\u00f8 Formation is much thicker and reaches more than 150\u00a0m in thickness in the Hammerfest Basin and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Zone, respectively, while it is considerable thinner in the Hoop Area and further to the east on the Bjarmeland Platform. In the Hoop Area, the thickness of the St\u00f8 Formation varies regionally from c. 10 m in 7324\/10-1 to 22\u00a0m in 7324\/2-1 (Figs. 3\u20135).\nThe St\u00f8 Formation represent predominantly a shoreline depositional environment, which also includes tidally influenced tidal bars and fluvial channels. The lowermost boundary of the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area is defined by a transgressive lag following a rise in relative sea level, which is unconformably overlying the Nordmela Formation (e.g. wells 7324\/7-2, 7324\/8-1, 7324\/9-1, 7325\/4-1) and the Fruholmen Formation (7324\/8-2, 7325\/1-1, 7324\/2-1) (Figs. 3 and 4). The erosional surface between the Norian Fruholmen Formation and the base of the St\u00f8 Formation, dated to late Toarcian, spans nearly 40\u00a0Ma and represent a prolonged phase of non-deposition and erosion in the Hoop Area, However, where the Pliensbachian Nordmela formation is present, the hiatus between the Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations is limited to up to 5\u00a0Ma (Fig. 5).\nDating of the internal units within the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area is poorly constrained but a late Toarcian to early Bajocian age is defined for formation. This is due to barren samples and few diagnostic age markers from the biostratigraphic analysis. Because of relatively poor resolution, the exact temporal and spatial relationship between the internal units in the St\u00f8 Formation are not resolved. However, the St\u00f8 Formation is apparently \u2013 at least \u2013 composed of two units: The lower unit comprises transgressive lag deposits which is superimposed by a relatively thick upper unit consisting of homogenous cross-bedded fluvio-tidal sandstones, as observed in cores from wells 7324\/7-2, 7324\/8-1 and well 7324\/9-1 (e.g. Fig. 4d) (Klausen et al., 2018). The boundary between these two units is erosional. Further north, in wells 7324\/2-1 and 7325\/1-1, a possible third unit in the upper part of the St\u00f8 Formation is characterized by mud-to silt-dominated beds which appear to be absent in the wells to the south (7324\/7-2,7324\/8-1, 7324\/9-1).\nDetrital zircon-analyses of the St\u00f8 Formation in the wells from the Hoop Area show that it includes similar Uralide\/Novaya Zemlya-ages as observed for the Fruholmen Formation (Klausen et al., 2017, 2018), but importantly the upper part of the St\u00f8 Formation comprise samples with a dominant Caledonian age peak along with higher abundances of older grains suggesting sediment input from the southern margin without reworked Triassic strata (Klausen et al., 2019). This distinct change corresponds to the facies change between the two units observed in the St\u00f8 Formation from the Hoop wells mentioned above: An upper massive fluvial sandstone that erodes into a basal transgressive lag for example at c. 676,1\u00a0m MD in 7324\/8-1 (Fig. 4c).\nMost sandstone samples from the St\u00f8 Formation are clean quartz arenites (Fig. 6). Compared to the underlying Nordmela Formation, increased mineralogical maturity in the St\u00f8 Formation is coupled with an overall increase in sorting and grain roundness. The St\u00f8 Formation sandstones are also associated with thin, pebble-graded conglomerate horizons that occur more frequently than in the Nordmela Formation below. The porosity in non-cemented intervals ranges generally from 22 to 28%, while permeability ranges from 200 to 9000 mD (Fig. 6).\nThe massive St\u00f8 Formation sandstones in well 7324\/2-1, located c. 40\u00a0km to the north, has smaller grain size and higher mud content (Vclay: 16%) than the wells in the Wisting Area. This could be attributed to a more distal position to the marginal marine system that characterizes the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area. A more distal facies is also encountered in the nearby wells in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (e.g. 7321\/8-1). These observations might suggest that the very well-developed channel sandstones encountered in the 7324\/8-1 and 7324\/7-2 can be relatively local.\nIn the transition to the Fuglen Formation and assigned to the uppermost St\u00f8 Formation is the Bathonian Brentskardhaugen Bed Equivalent. This is a remani\u00e9 polymict conglomerate is in some wells. These conglomerates are characterized by an up to 1\u00a0m thick conglomerate layer, consisting of pebble-sized, intraformational clasts and cm-sized belemnites in some of the Hoop Area wells. In most wells, the matrix of the lag has similar lithology as the substrate, reflecting erosion of the underlying sediments simultaneously with the deposition of the pebbles.\nThe matrix-loaded conglomerate contains a diverse clast assembly, including chert, quartz, phosphate and carbonate nodules, pyrite concretions, glauconite peloids and fossil fragments. Mono- and polycrystalline pebbles are typically well-rounded, whereas the other clast components are sub-angular (Fig. 6). Deposition of this condensed unit is caused by subaqueous precipitation in a sediment-starved marine environment following a rise in relative sea-level and defines the flooding at the base of the Fuglen Formation which overlay the Realgrunnen Subgroup.\n\n\n3.6\nFuglen Formation (Bathonian-Callovian)\nThe St\u00f8 Formation is unconformably succeeded by the Fuglen Formation which varies in thickness from c. 20 m (e.g., 7324\/8-1) in the south to c. 100 m in the north (e.g., 7325\/1-1). The transition between these formations is represented by a long hiatus (at least c. 2 Ma; Fig. 5).\nThe plane-parallel laminated mudstone of the Fuglen Formation consists of predominantly clay-graded quartz, illite and kaolin clay minerals, with local variations in mineral fractions. Siderite occasionally account for 25\u201350% of the bulk, whereas ankerite, pyrite, glauconite and apatite occur in minor portions (1\u201310%).\nIn well 7324\/7-2 the basal part of Fuglen Formation 50\u00a0cm very fine-grained calcareous sandstone with burrows linked to the Skolithos ichnofacies with glauconite, ooids and pyrite (Bj\u00f8rnebye, 2019). This part is comparable or spot on with the Marh\u00f8gda Bed at the base of the Agardhfjellet Formation in Svalbard (c.f., B\u00e4ckstr\u00f8m and Nagy, 1985; Krajewski et al., 2001; Rismyhr et al., 2018). The ooids are here ferruginous. Marh\u00f8gda bed was her interpreted as a condensed sallow marine deposit (Krajewski et al., 2001).\nThe remaining part of the Fuglen Formation consist of mudstone with scarce glauconite gains and thin siltstone beds probably deposited in marine shelf environment, but probably under a slow sedimentation rate (Bj\u00f8rnebye, 2019).\n\n\n3.7\nSeismic stratigraphy\nThe high-resolution P-Cable data reveal details about thickness variations, unconformities and seismic stratigraphy of the Realgrunnen Subgroup which is not resolved in conventional seismic data (Fig. 7\n) (e.g., Faleide et al., 2019, 2021).\n\n\n3.8\nFruholmen Formation (Upper Triassic)\nThe P-Cable data shows a pronounced angular unconformity that characterize the boundary between the Fruholmen and Snadd formations and the overlying St\u00f8 and Fuglen formations towards the Svalis Dome (Figs. 8 and 9\n\n).\nIn the Hoop Area, the lowermost Akkar Member is easily identified on the seismic sections as a continuous, uniform and transparent package, while the seismic facies of the Reke Member is characterized by discontinuous high amplitude troughs, which suggest the presence of channelized features (Fig. 10\n). P-Cable 3D attribute maps show geometries resembling interdistributary channels, and in conventional 3D from Hoop at least 5\u00a0km wide channel deposits of highly sinuous character, representing scroll bars within a trunk channel can be interpreted (Athmer et al., 2016). Channel orientation show autocyclic variations and sinuosity with an overall transport direction to the NW, ranging from E to N similar to the underlying Snadd Formation (Klausen et al., 2014).\nThe high-resolution P-Cable seismic data show the regional extent of how the Fruholmen Formation varies considerably in thickness within the Hoop Area, being more complete in the Maud Basin while it thins towards north where both the Reke and Krabbe members are truncated. In the north, only the lowermost part of the Fruholmen Formation is preserved, as also documented by the wells in the area (Figs. 3 and 8).\nWithin the Fruholmen Formation, NNE-SSW trending faults are observed in parts of the Hoop Area. The Fruholmen Formation is more completely preserved in the hanging-wall and grabens and thus thinner reservoir units are expected at the crests of the rotated fault blocks (Fig. 11\n).\n\n\n3.9\nSt\u00f8\/Nordmela\/Tub\u00e5en formations (Lower to Middle Jurassic)\nThe St\u00f8 and Nordmela formations are not possible to separate from each other on seismic data, not even on high resolution P-Cable seismic. The relatively thin (max 25\u00a0m thick) and homogenous, sandstone-dominated St\u00f8 Formation with little internal contrast in acoustic impedance exhibits a diffuse, low amplitude trough.\nThe most remarkable observations made in the P-Cable data is the distinct erosional nature of the boundary between the St\u00f8\/Nordmela Formation and the underlying Fruholmen Formation, as seen in seismic section HR_15_2D_IKU, located west of the present Maud Basin: A 30\u00a0m deep incision or channel into the Akkar Member is observed, probably filled with sandy material of the Nordmela Formation (Fig. 12\n). The Nordmela Formation varies in thickness which is confirmed by well 7324\/7-3\u00a0S, and it is thicker here than in the other exploration wells in the Hoop Area (Krathus-Larsen, 2017).\nAttribute maps near the top St\u00f8 Formation in the P-Cable seismic has revealed geomorphological features in map view that might be interpreted as strand plain deposits or beach ridges (Fig. 13\n). These strand plain deposits trending WNW-ESE, opposite to the direction of the coastline during the deposition of both the Fruholmen and Snadd formations (Klausen et al., 2016).\n\n\n3.10\nStratigraphic equivalents on svalbard\nThe Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic outcrops (Wilhelm\u00f8ya Subgroup) on Svalbard are analogues to the time equivalent deposits in the Hoop Area (Fig. 14\n). The Wilhelm\u00f8ya Subgroup is subdivided into three formations. The lower formation is the offshore to distal delta front deposits of the Norian Flatsalen Formation, corresponding to the offshore Fruholmen Formation. The coastal plain\/tidal flat deposition of the Sj\u00f8grenfjellet Member of the Svensk\u00f8ya Formation (Hettangian-Pliensbachian), as seen in south, north and east, are the onshore equivalent the Tub\u00e5en and Nordmela formations. The shoreline deposited Mohnh\u00f8gda Member of the Svensk\u00f8ya Formation (late Pliensbachian\/early Toarcian) and the inner shelf deposited Kongs\u00f8ya Formation (late Toarcian\/early Aalenian) represent lower and upper part of St\u00f8 Formation respectively (Fig. 14). The uppermost part of the Kongs\u00f8ya Formation occasionally consists of an up to 4\u00a0m thick polymict phosphatic and glauconitic conglomerate which is the Brentskardhaugen Bed equivalent of Bathonian age (B\u00e4ckstr\u00f8m and Nagy, 1985). An equivalent to the Brentskardhaugen Bed is also seen below the base of the Fuglen Formation in the Hoop area as well in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin.\nAs for the Realgrunnen Subgroup in the Hoop Area, the Wilhelm\u00f8ya Subgroup is defined at the base by a key sequence stratigraphic surface; the pan Arctic Norian Flooding surface, which also is an important mappable seismic reflector in the Southwestern Barents Sea. Onshore it is seen as a polymict phosphatic glauconitic conglomerate interpreted as transgressive lag deposits (Rismyhr et al., 2018). Besides, the important stratigraphic hiatus recorded between the Fruholmen (Norian) and the Nordmela formations (Pliensbachian) in the Hoop area is also observed between the Flatsalen Bed and the Svenske\u00f8ya Formation on Svalbard (Fig. 14). This suggests that an important superregional event influenced this part of the Arctic in the latest Triassic and into the early Jurassic and resulted in erosion and non-deposition. The two areas were in comparable structural settings and probably responded similarly to larger scale forcing factors such as eustatic sea-level changes and regional tectonics, as the Novaya Zemlya protrusion in the late Triassic to early Jurassic (Klausen et al., 2022 in press).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nTemporal and spatial development of the basin infill\nIn this study we have divided the Realgrunnen Subgroup in the Hoop Area into seven distinct stages, including periods of non-deposition and erosion (Fig. 15\n). Below we discuss the tectonostratigraphic evolution for these seven stages and its influence on petrography and rates of accumulation.\n\n4.1.1\nStage 1: basin infill of Fruholmen Formation (Norian-Rhaetian?)\nThe Fruholmen Formation, deposited above the early Norian pan Arctic flooding (unconformity), represent an overall progradation of a large-scale deltaic system over the Barents Sea margin and Svalbard (Fig. 15) (Gjelberg et al., 1987; Klausen et al., 2019). As for the Snadd Formation, the Fruholmen Formation represented deposition within a high accommodation setting (Klausen et al., 2017). The stacked fluvio-deltaic deposits of the Reke Member might also suggest that rate of accommodation and sediment supply was relatively balanced, as for the underlying Snadd Formation, with no major episodes of erosion and non-deposition.\nIf we assume that the Fruholmen Formation had a more or less uniform distribution across the basin similar to the underlying Triassic formations and scaling to the more complete successions of the formation in for example the Hammerfest Basin, the actual accumulation rates have been considerable higher for the Fruholmen Formation in the Hoop Area than what can be estimated based on the preserved succession. Under these assumptions, the accumulation rates could range from 10\u00a0m to 30\u00a0m per Ma, dependent on uncertainties regarding thickness and age of the Fruholmen Formation.\nSediments were primarily sourced from the Uralides and Novaya Zemlya (Klausen et al., 2017) in the Triassic, but higher compositional maturity and the occurrence of recycled quartz grains in the Fruholmen Formation distinguish it from underlying Triassic successions (Line et al., 2020; Haile et al., 2020). A significant maturation trend is also observed at the Carnian-Norian boundary along the southern margins of the basin, but these occurred in association with a change in provenance (Bergan and Knarud, 1993; Ryseth, 2014). The more subtle maturation trend for the Fruholmen Formation in the Hoop Area is better explained by recycling of older, consolidated Triassic successions that were exposed during uplift of the Novaya Zemlya Fold and Thrust Belt (Line et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.1.2\nStage 2: erosion and non-deposition (Rhaetian to early Pliensbachian)\nThe base of the Nordmela (Pliensbachian) and the St\u00f8 (Toarcian) formations are developed over a major diachronous unconformity that can be traced regionally across the Barents Sea and Svalbard. Depending on which formation is found above the unconformity, the hiatus it represents locally spans from 35 to 40\u00a0Ma in the Hoop Area (Fig. 5). This major hiatus is explained by forebulge uplift related to the Novaya Zemlya protrusion of the Uralide-Taimyr fold and thrust belt in the late Triassic (M\u00fcller et al., 2019). In response to these compressional forces, the whole Bjarmeland Platform and the Fedynsky High were uplifted in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, and Permian salts in the SW Barents Sea were remobilized (Fig. 15).\nAs a result of the salt remobilization, the Svalis Dome was uplifted resulting in tilting and differential truncation of the Fruholmen Formation and even the Snadd Formation. This resulted in NNE-SSW orientated rotated faults blocks where erosion took place on the crests of the uplifted footwalls. The development of the Svalis Dome is previously assigned to be of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age (M\u00f8rk and Elvebakk, 1999), but the high-resolution P-Cable data shows that the movement was of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic age, time-equivalent to the Novaya Zemlya tectonic event (Figs. 8 and 14).\nThe uplift of the Svalis Dome also resulted in the formation of several rotated fault blocks as identified to the east of the Maud Basin, and a highly variable thickness of the Fruholmen Formation (Fig. 11). The thickness of this stratigraphic interval reaches up to 600\u00a0m elsewhere in the SW Barents Sea, and the 20\u2013100\u00a0m thickness in the Hoop Area suggest that the erosion was immense in this area, at least several hundreds of meters. Consequently, the Krabbe and Reke members, which defines the uppermost parts of the Fruholmen Formation, are completely absent in the northern part of the Hoop Area. Furthermore, the salt movement beneath the Svalis Dome resulted in the formation of a rim syncline to the north due to the salt withdrawal and played an important role to preserve the Fruholmen Formation, and especially the reservoir units of the Reke Member (Fig. 15). Such basin-scale uplift events often result in massive reorganization of the basins, and the formation of considerable hiatuses, and the time embodied in these hiatuses is up to 10 or even 100-fold that of the time represented in the deposits (Miall, 2015).\n\n\n4.1.3\nStage 3: deposition of Nordmela Formation (late Pliensbachian)\nThe Nordmela Formation reach several hundreds of meters in the Hammerfest Basin and the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Zone (Olaussen et al., 1984; Gjelberg et al., 1987), but is present only as a thin blanket of sandstones in the Hoop Area (Klausen et al., 2019). The reason for the contrasting development along the western margin and the Bjarmeland Platform (Fig. 5) is attributed to the fact that this part of the Bjarmeland Platform was a structural high throughout most of the Early Jurassic following contraction associated with uplift in Novaya Zemlya.\nThe long duration of non-deposition and erosion, spanning tens of millions of years, transformed the landscape by periods of river incision forming wide valleys (Fig. 15). Such erosional features are identified at the transition between the Fruholmen Formation and the Nordmela Formation. This, together with partial preservation of the following transgressive tidal deposits, can explain the variable thickness of the Nordmela Formation in the Hoop Area (typically 1\u20137\u00a0m), such as the somewhat thicker deposits reported by Krathus-Larsen (2017) in well 7324\/7-3\u00a0S.\nThe source area of the Nordmela Formation is enigmatic, but detrital zircon analysis suggests that the Caledonian and Fennoscandian hinterlands started to act as an important contributor of sediments (Klausen et al., 2017), while the presence of reworked Triassic spores and pollen in the lowermost part of the Nordmela Formation, indicate that reworking of Triassic rocks was an important contributor of sediment as well. Reworking of underlying Triassic sediments, in combination with supply of medium- and coarse-grained sediments from the south, is supported by the moderate sorting and grain size distributions documented from the Nordmela Formation in the Hoop Area. Local provenance areas, such as the Svalis Dome, probably acted as a source for reworked Triassic sediment to the Nordmela Formation.\n\n\n4.1.4\nStage 4: uplift and non-deposition\/erosion (early Pliensbachian - early Toarcian?)\nA renewed period of non-deposition and erosion occurred after the deposition of Nordmela Formation, which probably lasted at least 5 million years (Fig. 14). This hiatus is not as pronounced in adjacent areas such as the Hammerfest Basin and the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yarenna Fault Complex (Olaussen et al., 1984; Klausen et al., 2019). Although it is difficult to evaluate the cause for this episode due to the condensed nature of the accumulated deposits, the non-deposition can be related to a regional uplift of the Bjarmeland Platform. Alternatively, it can be speculated upon if renewed salt halokinesis in the Svalis Dome contributed to a local uplift of parts of the Hoop Area.\nThe unconformity between the Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations might be locally overprinted and entirely masked, but at the same time it is impossible to discriminate whether Nordmela Formation was deposited there or not. The upper boundary of both the Nordmela and Fruholmen formations is defined by a subaerial unconformity prior to the flooding surface that defines base St\u00f8 Formation.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that the nearshore deposits were influenced by the major fall in the eustatic sea level in the early Toarcian (Haq et al., 1987), which resulted in the erosion of the underlying Nordmela Formation, represented by a wave ravinement surface, and potentially also further truncation of the Fruholmen Formation. The Nordmela Formation seems elsewhere in the Barents Sea to passively fill accommodation between local highs developed during the Tub\u00e5en Formation as part of a gradual transgression that culminated with the deposition of the St\u00f8 Formation (Klausen et al., 2019).\nThe limited thickness of the Nordmela Formation (1\u20137\u00a0m) suggests that only a fraction of the time is represented by deposition. The Nordmela Formation is considerably thicker 200\u00a0km to the east on the Bjarmeland Platform where it comprises up to 75\u00a0m thick, multistorey channel sandstones. It can be speculated that the Nordmela Formation in the Hoop Area was much thicker and what is preserved today is just what is left after erosion and wave ravinement at the transgressive base of the St\u00f8 Formation.\n\n\n4.1.5\nStage 5: deposition of the St\u00f8 Formation (Toarcian-Aalenian)\nDeposits in the St\u00f8 Formation of the Hoop Area suggest that an increase in relative sea-level took place probably during the late Toarcian, which resulted in the deposition of nearshore to inner shelf deposits across the Barents Sea (Fig. 15). Multiple stratigraphic boundaries with unconformable facies changes or prominent wave ravinement surfaces marked by polymict conglomerates, often with phosphatic, are seen throughout the formation (Gjelberg et al., 1987; Klausen et al., 2018). An example of an abrupt facies change is a regressive pulse characterized by fluvial channel and mouth bar sandstones in the St\u00f8 Formation in 7324\/8-1 (Fig. 15). Above this regressive wedge there is another transgressive conglomeratic lag deposits, probably of Bathonian age, which characterize the transition to the Fuglen Formation in some of the wells in the Hoop Area (Fig. 6A). Apart from the major hiatuses at the base and upper part of the formation, several stratigraphic breaks within the St\u00f8 Formation are also evident (Figs. 4 and 6).\nFor the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area, the c. 20 m thick succession represent a period of 15 million years (Toarcian to Bathonian). This could, very simplified, suggest that the rate of accumulation was very low \u2013 only 1\u00a0m per Ma. This support the conclusions in Ryseth (2014) and Klausen et al. (2017) that the rate of accumulations for the whole Lower to Middle Jurassic succession in the Hoop area was considerably lower than for the Triassic. The St\u00f8 Formation was however probably deposited by a series of depositional events, each spanning much shorter time. In for example wells 7324\/8-1 and 7324\/7-2, the transgressive lag at the base of the St\u00f8 Formation is followed unconformably by fluvial and tidal inlet to barrier deposits (e.g. Fig. 15).\nIn comparison to the 1\u20132.5\u00a0m thick transgressive lag at the base of the St\u00f8 Formation in 7324\/8-1 and 7324\/9-1 respectively, the Galveston Island barrier is 12\u00a0m thick, and 3.5 ka old at it is base (Bernard et al., 1962; Miall, 2015), which indicate an average rate of sedimentation of 3.4\u00a0m\/ka. If we assume the same rate of sedimentation of the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area, the 2.5\u00a0m thick sandstone unit was deposited in a period of c. 700 years. Fluvial deposits in the middle or upper part of the formation are up to 14.5\u00a0m thick (e.g. 7324\/8-1 in Klausen et al. (2018)). Stouthamer et al. (2011) showed that the aggradation rate of fluvial deposits in the Rhine-Meuse delta range between 0.4 and 4\u00a0m\/kyr depending on the position relative to the main channel axis and its shoreline position, and from this range Miall (2015) used a local aggradation rate of 2.8\u00a0m\/kyr as an approximate channel aggradation rate. Assuming the same rate for the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area, the 14.5\u00a0m thick fluvial sandstone that is preserved was potentially deposited in a period of c. 5000 years.\nIn a similar exercise, de Natris and Helland-Hansen (2012) used rates of sedimentation derived from modern depositional environments to calculate elapsed time in the Tarbert formation in the North Sea, and they concluded that rate versus thickness for each facies explained only 7% of the 2.8\u00a0Ma elapsed. For the St\u00f8 Formation we find that the time of deposition only embody below one per mille (0,04%) of the total time of the chronostratigraphy which the formation represents. This emphasize the fact that this ultra-condensed section is characterized by extremely long periods of non-deposition, abrupted by short, frozen accidents of accumulation which is preserved. The order of magnitude that separates the time accounted for by deposition in the two studies scale to the different time spans over which the entire St\u00f8 Formation (c. 15 Ma) was deposited over compared to the significantly shorter period over which the Tarbert Formation was deposited (c. 2.8\u00a0Ma) (de Natris, 2012). Naturally, more time gaps are captured in the St\u00f8 Formation relative to the Tarbert Formation. Adding to this difference in longevity and potential frequency of hiatuses, is the fact that the Tarbert Formation is one order of magnitude thicker (more than 200\u00a0m) compared to the St\u00f8 Formation (c. 20 m).\nThe main sediment source for the St\u00f8 Formation was local reworking of the Nordmela and Fruholmen formations, or older Triassic sediments in the basal part of the formation (Klausen et al., 2018), and Fennoscandian in the upper parts (Klausen et al., 2019). This is reconcilable with considerable erosion of the Fruholmen Formation in nearby areas during Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, and the presence of reworked Late Triassic spores and pollen in the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area. Periodic uplift of local source areas, such as the Svalis Dome, was also important for the clastic input of sand into the basin during deposition of the lower part of the St\u00f8 Formation. Within the formation, there are large variations in the reservoir quality, as exemplified by exploration wells 7321\/8-1 in the Fingerdjupet Basin and 7325\/1-1 (Klausen et al., 2018). Poorer reservoir in the latter is directly linked to higher mud content, and the deposition took place in a more distal position relative to time-equivalent fluvial deposits in the Wisting area. This suggests that proximal-distal trends in the depositional system, such as distance to the Fennoscandian margin and uplifted local high such as the Svalis Dome, controlled reservoir quality.\n\n\n4.1.6\nStage 6: Bajocian-Bathonian: erosional event\nThe deposition of the St\u00f8 Formation in the Hoop Area was followed by a renewed phase of erosion, representing a hiatus of at least c. 2 Ma (Fig. 15). This erosion resulted in an uneven distribution of the St\u00f8 Formation. A regional tilting opposite to that imposed by the earlier uplift event in the Rhaetian, can explain why the uppermost part of the St\u00f8 Formation was eroded or not deposited in the area around 7324\/8-1, while it was preserved in the 7325\/1-1 and 7324\/2-1.\n\n\n4.1.7\nStage 7: Bathonian-Callovian: deposition of the Fuglen Formation\nDuring the relative sea-level rise that took place in the Bathonian, a transgressive conglomerate, mainly composed of phosphate nodules and pebble-sized clast assemblages, was deposited regionally in a shelfal setting in the Barents Sea and towards Svalbard (Fig. 15). The mixture of well-rounded and sub-angular clasts suggests an incorporation of long-lived and more recent sediment input. As such, the conglomerate represents a lag of mixed origins, where erosion and reworking over time have concentrated both extrabasinal and intrabasinal clast components of various ages. The prolonged sediment starvation and high concentration of organic matter required to form pyrite, phosphate and glauconite (Burnett, 1977; Odin and Matter, 1981; Baldermann et al., 2012) suggest that these lag constituents are remnants of former marine shelf sediments. Pebble-sized quartz and chert represent extrabasinal sediment input delivered to the basin.\nThe overlying, homogeneous calcareous silty mudstone with glauconite in the Fuglen Formation implies low depositional energy typical of distal marine and starved basin fill. While the deposition of the underlying formations, such as St\u00f8 and Nordmela, was abrupt and episodic separated by numerous hiatuses, the deposition of the Fuglen Formation was probably more continuous and could have formed over 100s of thousands of years without significant breaks in sedimentation in the distal shelf. However, the condensed unit at the base of the Fuglen Formation, e.g. the Brentskardhaugen Bed Equivalent analogue, required considerable time to form and might be associated with a significant hiatus before distal shelf deposits started to accumulate.\n\n\n\n4.2\nMind the gap: implications for understanding reservoir potential in ultra-condensed sections\nThe multiple hiatuses that characterize ultra-condensed sections impose a major control on the distribution of reservoir properties. Prolonged surface exposure and reworking associated with non-deposition and erosion yield a high potential for sedimentary particles to react with various components of the hydro-, bio- and atmosphere. Sandstones deposited in ultra-condensed sections are therefore highly susceptible to textural and compositional alteration processes which often lead to increased reservoir quality. In this study, we have documented how a major inversion of the Barents Sea Basin changed the tectonic configuration in the Hoop Area from a high-accommodation basin with balanced sediment accumulation and -supply rates, to a low-accommodation setting with episodic deposition, erosion and extensive sediment cannibalization. This tectonic rearrangement is accompanied by a shift from poor to moderate reservoir quality in the Triassic Snadd and Fruholmen formations, to extremely well-developed and prolific reservoirs in the Jurassic Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations.\nThe better reservoir quality recorded in the Jurassic sandstones is mainly attributed to a significant increase in permeability (Fig. 6B\u2013C) and suggest that the best reservoir units in the Barents Sea Basin can be linked to conditions that suppress accumulation of argillaceous material in the pore space. As opposed to periods with high rate of accommodation, where coarse-graded sediments are trapped in the most proximal part of the system, low-accommodation settings enable coarse-graded detritus to migrate further into the basin (Paola and Angevinet, 1992). This trend is observed across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary on the Barents Shelf. Medium-grained sandstone reservoirs of the Fruholmen Formation occur exclusively in proximity to the Caledonian and Fennoscandian provenance terrains in the south, whereas time-equivalent strata in the distal Hoop Area is dominated by very fine-to fine-grained sandstones sourced primarily from the Urals and Novaya Zemlya (Line et al., 2020). During the Pliensbachian, however, medium-to coarse-grained sandstones and pebble to cobble-sized clasts from the quartz-rich Caledonian and Fennoscandian provenance areas were introduced to the Hoop Area during the deposition of the Nordmela Formation. Consequently, lower rates of accommodation improved the reservoir quality in distal positions by displacing the gravel-sand transition out into the basin and thereby facilitated the influx of quartz-rich sand from more mature provenance areas.\nThe architectural style (e.g. sandbody geometry\/facies, stacking pattern and interconnectedness) associated with condensed sections and low-accommodation settings also promote high sand:mud ratio and suppress the potential for incorporating argillaceous material into sandy intervals. During the high-accommodation basin configuration in the Triassic, sand accumulated in confined channels enclosed by floodplain clays (Klausen et al., 2014). The high preservation of argillaceous deposits allowed floodplain clays to be incorporated into the sand during channel erosion and riverbank collapse, thereby reducing the reservoir permeability in these reservoirs (Line et al., 2020). By contrast, lower rates of accommodation are linked to increased amalgamation (Bridge et al., 1993), which promote sandstone amalgamation and low preservation of fine-graded and argillaceous sediment in the system (van Yperen et al., 2020). Prolonged sediment cannibalization in the Hoop Area during the Early-Middle Jurassic acted as a discrimination agent separating silt- and clay-graded material from the sand- and gravel fractions and suppressed incorporation of clays into the sandy reservoir units. Clay- and silt-sized particle fractions appear to have accumulated in the more distal, low-energetic parts of the system, which explains the poor reservoir quality in wells drilled in distal parts of the St\u00f8 Formation (e.g. 7325\/1-1 and 7324\/2-1) and the Fuglen Formation.\nThe evolution of reservoir properties with depth is also closely linked to the mineralogical composition of the sediment (Bj\u00f8rlykke, 2014), which changes abruptly across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the Barents Sea Basin (Line et al., 2020). In addition to a well-documented provenance shift in the Early Norian (Bergan and Knarud, 1993; M\u00f8rk, 1999; Ryseth, 2014; Fleming et al., 2016), uplift-induced reworking has previously been considered amongst the main factors driving the Upper Triassic subarkosic sandstones in the Hoop Area towards quartz arenitic compositions in the Jurassic (Line et al., 2020). However, reworked sediments do not mature compositionally during physical wear but are instead monotonously quartz-rich because their parent sandstones have undergone prolonged diagenetic dissolution and chemical weathering (Garzanti, 2017). Hiatuses and erosional unconformities are important in this context because the potential for sediments to change their bulk composition is much higher at shallow depths due to mass transfer constraints at greater burial (Bj\u00f8rlykke and Jahren, 2012). Long periods of non-deposition in uplifted areas on the Barents Shelf during the early Pliensbachian (Stage 2) and Early Toarcian (Stage 4) allowed fine-graded litharenites and subarkosic sediments of exposed Triassic strata to be leached by meteoric water (Fig. 15). The condensed nature of the Lower Jurassic units likely promoted extensive kaolinization of labile silicate grains (e.g. feldspars, micas and Fe-bearing rock fragments) across the Barents Sea basin. However, as erosion rates probably exceeded the propagation rate of the dissolution front in the sandstones (Bj\u00f8rkum et al., 1990), accumulation of diagenetic kaolin in the intergranular pore space was efficiently suppressed by subsequent sediment cannibalization. Diagenetic dissolution and subsequent removal of argillaceous precipitation products through multiple regressive-transgressive cycles over the course of 35\u00a0Ma therefore skewed the Lower to Middle Jurassic sandstones of the Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations toward higher mineralogical maturity (Fig. 6), adding to the effect of increased sediment supply from more mature provenance areas.\nThe St\u00f8 Formation contains both fine-graded particles inherited from reworking of Triassic strata and coarse-graded extrabasinal particles derived directly from the Norwegian mainland and indirectly through reworking of underlying Early Jurassic units (Nordmela and possibly Tub\u00e5en formations). Higher compositional maturity, degree of sorting and grain roundness indicate more extensive meteoric leaching, amalgamation and cannibalization of the sands deposited in the Toarcian St\u00f8 Formation compared to the preserved parts of the Pliensbachian Nordmela Formation in the Hoop Area. The St\u00f8 Formation would thus represent the extreme endmember in the Early-Middle Jurassic condensation cycle, which resulted in cleaner sandstones with better sorting, less clay, and hence, better reservoir properties. However, our study also shows that local variations exist within the overall condensed succession: lithological variations are linked to proximal-distal facies trends in the overall distribution of reservoir rocks and it shows that the results of individual accidents of deposition are important when these are preserved in the rock record.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nUpper Triassic to Lower Jurassic tectonostratigraphic development in the Hoop Area is distinct from other areas in the Barents Sea. This is due to a complex interplay between regional forebulge uplift with local uplift and erosion of reactivated salt structures. This resulted in seven stages of basin infill and erosion, including the deposition of Fruholmen, Nordmela, St\u00f8 and Fuglen formations, which were interrupted by major phases of non-deposition and truncation. Especially the ultra-condensed St\u00f8 Formation is separated into several discrete depositional episodes, where the estimated rate of accumulation for the preserved unit only represents a fragment of the total time which the unit represent.\nThe impact of the condensation is that the Hoop Area developed its most prolific reservoir interval, especially within the Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations. The low accommodation setting was favorable for the sandstone amalgamation and the uplift caused erosion and reworking of sediments, improving the reservoir quality. In addition to the important sediment input of clean, quartz-rich sands from Fennoscandia, proximity to local source areas such as the Svalis Dome, favored the access of lithologically mature reworked clastics. The deposition in the more distal, low-energetic parts of the system, however, seems to have promoted mudstone and silt even within the overall condensed succession, while the more proximal parts of the system, as in the rim around the Svalis Dome, was favored by a high-energetic system that promoted both better sorting and fractionation of mud and silt from sand.\nThis study attributes major improvements in reservoir quality is to lower rate of accommodation and condensation. The interplay between episodic deposition, erosion and prolonged periods of non-deposition that characterize ultra-condensed sections like the Lower Jurassic formations in the Barents Sea promoted high-quality, prolific reservoir units.\n\n","1":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nReservoir quality controls the storage, distribution, and flow of fluids within a rock body and mainly depends upon rock texture, depositional setting and porosity modification by diagenetic processes. The original composition and texture of the reservoir rocks strongly influence the effects of diagenesis, which can either improve or degrade original reservoir quality by modifying its porosity and permeability (Bloch and Helmond, 1995; Ajdukiewicz and Lander, 2010). Therefore, detailing the evolution of porosity through time and space is a key task for the oil and gas Industry, but is fundamental as well for the energy transition, e.g. gas storage or geothermal energy production from siliciclastic lithologies. However, constraining the geologic history of sedimentary basins is not straightforward. In particular, due to the several variables needed to constrain the regional heat flow of a sedimentary basin through time, this is difficult to achieve.\nIn the Illizi-Ghadames Basin (IGB) located in North Africa, the possible thermal effect on the regional petroleum system resulting from Cenozoic magmatic activity is still debated (English et al., 2016b, 2017a, 2017b; Di Giulio et al., 2021) albeit it is fundamental for the development of new exploration prospects regarding conventional and unconventional reservoirs (e.g. Wang et al., 2019). The two major magmatic cycles identified in the Hoggar region to the south of the IGB occurred in the Paleocene-Eocene (between 70 and 50\u00a0Ma) and the Miocene-Quaternary (between 25 and 0\u00a0Ma) (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992). Several present-day topographic domes (Hoggar and Tibesti Domes; Fig. 1\n) in which crystalline basement and Cenozoic volcanic rocks are exposed (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992; Li\u00e9geois et al., 2005; Galeazzi et al., 2010) have probably formed during these magmatic events.\nConsequently, the thermal scenarios proposed for the IGB (Di Giulio et al., 2021) can be summarized as follows: i) no thermal effects of Cenozoic magmatism and only a deep pre-Hercynian burial followed by strong Hercynian orogenic erosion; ii) limited pre-Hercynian burial and an early Cenozoic overheating related to the older Paleocene-Eocene magmatic cycle; and iii) limited pre-Hercynian burial and a late Cenozoic overheating related to the younger magmatic cycle. The second and third cases are chosen as end members of the Cenozoic volcanic activity.\nAs the cementation of quartz is strongly dependent on the temperature history of the basin, in this paper, the modelling of the diagenetic evolution of Devonian reservoir rocks in a sector of the IGB (Fig. 1B) is used to evaluate the likelihood of each of these thermal scenarios, by determining which one successfully reproduces the measured data. Furthermore, the impact of each scenario on the temporal evolution of the petrophysical reservoir parameters of the studied reservoir rocks is investigated and discussed.\n\n\n2\nGeological framework and state of the art\nThe IGB is located along the northern margins of the Precambrian Reguibat (Eglab) Shield (West African Craton) and the Hoggar (Touareg) Shield and extends from southern Algeria and Tunisia into Libya (Fig. 1A and B). The IGB is considered one of the most prolific hydrocarbon areas in Africa due to its recoverable reserves estimated at around 5 Bbbl (billion barrels) of oil and 37 Tcf (trillion cubic feet) of gas (Galeazzi et al., 2010). As shown in Fig. 1B, the Illizi Basin is bounded eastward by the Tihemboka Arch, that separates the Illizi from the Ghadames basin. South of the IGB is the Hoggar Massif, where the Cenozoic magmatic activity occurred principally in two major cycles between 70 and 50\u00a0Ma and between 25 and 0\u00a0Ma (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992). The magmatic rocks emplaced during this episode, can be mainly found in the neighbouring areas, outside the study area (highlighted in black in Fig. 1A). Lastly, to the west of the IGB there is the Amguid-Hassi Touareg structural axis which divides the IGB from the Mouydir Basin (Booth et al., 1998; Klett, 2000; English et al., 2017b).\nSince the early 1950s, when the exploration in this area started due to the discovery of enormous hydrocarbon reservoirs, the structural and depositional history of the basin has been described by several scientific works (e.g. Tissot et al., 1973; Macgregor, 1996; Booth et al., 1998; Traut et al., 1998; Galeazzi et al., 2010; English et al., 2016a; 2017a, 2017b). However, a large amount of data collected during these hydrocarbon investigations are still proprietary, and previous studies are lacking of well-defined stratigraphic constraints (English et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; 2017b).\nIn the IGB, the majority of the Paleozoic sequence is well-preserved although the Hercynian orogeny caused extensive uplift and subsequent widespread erosion (English et al., 2016c; Acheche et al., 2001; Di Giulio et al., 2021). Because of that, part of the late Paleozoic sequence is missing and its original thickness, which also varied across the region, is difficult to evaluate.\nAfter the opening of the Tethyan seaway, causing extensional movements in the whole north African area, Mid-Late Eocene intraplate magmatism and compressional movements caused uplift and inversion of preexisting faults. This led to the development of topographic swells with large-scale exhumation of sedimentary basins such as the Illizi and Tim Merso\u00ef Basins (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992; Wilson et al., 1998; Li\u00e9geois et al., 2005; English et al., 2016b; Di Giulio et al., 2021).\nIn these basins, previous studies of organic matter maturity from Paleozoic-Mesozoic reservoir rocks determined a widespread over-maturation with respect to the present-day burial depth and geothermal gradient (Wilson et al., 1998; Li\u00e9geois et al., 2005; English et al., 2016b; Di Giulio et al., 2021). During the geological history of the basin, two main events have been commonly considered as possible causes for this over maturation: i) deep burial before the erosion during the Hercynian orogeny; ii) Cenozoic heating resulting from intracontinental magmatism. In the studied sector of the IGB, Di Giulio et al. (2021) determined that pre-Hercynian orogeny burial alone cannot account for the observed maturation of organic matter because it affects both pre-Hercynian Paleozoic reservoir rocks and post-Hercynian Triassic reservoir sandstones. Therefore, the authors concluded that overheating due to Cenozoic magmatism has played a primary role in the maturation history of the basin. However, they were not able to identify which of the two Cenozoic magmatic cycles was more significant. In this paper, we aim at resolving this outstanding question using a diagenetic modelling approach. As quartz cement is sensitive to thermal exposure, here we assess the most likely thermal scenario for the studied basin by comparing the observed quartz cement abundances to calculated values using the diagenetic modelling software package Touchstone\u2122 (Geocosm LLC).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nTo determine the precise timing of Cenozoic heating, this work relies on a detailed study of the diagenetic histories of a set of core samples (provided by Eni) derived from 6 wells (see Fig. 1B for location).\nThe stratigraphy of these 6 wells shows the Silurian-Devonian-Carboniferous sequence is dominantly composed of continental interbedded sandstone and shale units with minor carbonate intervals present in the middle Devonian and upper Carboniferous (Fig. 1C).\nAmong 100 core plug samples, 36 samples were selected from Devonian quartz-rich sandstones, recovered between 2480 and 2890\u00a0m depth below rotary table. Sample selection was based on the textural and petrographic features of the sandstones which best represent the whole dataset.\n\n3.1\nMethods\nTo better understand the diagenetic events and the thermal history of the studied reservoir rocks, the software Touchstone\u2122 was applied to model compaction and quartz cementation as a function of thermal and effective stress history. This software, particularly suited for sandstone reservoir quality modelling, links process-based concepts with parameters that can be optimized during modelling. A number of different dataset can be added to the Touchstone\u2122 model and used to constrain the best fit thermal history for the samples, such as petrophysical data (porosity and permeability), petrographic data as modal composition of both rock constituents and porosity (grains, matrix and cements and primary, secondary inter- and intragranular, micropores), fluid inclusion microthermometry, and thermochronologic data (apatite fission track).\nIn the next sections, the methods for collecting the experimental dataset used as input in Touchstone\u2122 are presented, along with a brief description of the software.\n\n3.1.1\nExperimental data\n\n3.1.1.1\nPorosity and permeability data\nRoutine core analysis (RCA) has been performed by ENI S. p.a., and includes porosity and permeability measurements (see methods in McPhee et al., 2015). Sample plugs were treated with methanol to extract salts and dried at 110\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h in a conventional oven.\nThis RCA is used to determine basic petrophysical properties, and typically involves fluid saturation and petrophysical measurements on plugs, such as porosity, and unsteady-state permeability measurements (McPhee et al., 2015). The principal RCA tests is fluid saturations, where samples plugs treated with methanol in order to extract salts were heated at 110\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h in a conventional oven and cooled in a desiccator. Then, horizontal Klinkenberg-corrected unsteady-state pulse decay permeability at confining stresses of 5.5\u00a0MPa (800 psig) and porosity were measured using a Core Laboratories CMS\u2122-300 Automated Permeameter using helium. Porosity was determined using Boyle's law.\nFor the present work, the RCA dataset (see supplementary material) was supplemented by a detailed porosity description performed at the petrographic microscope based on a point counting procedure with 100 counted pores per sample (Chayes, 1949; Demirmen, 1971; Zhang et al., 2014 and references therein). This allowed us to classify and quantify the pore space into primary, secondary inter- and intragranular, mixed (oversized pores) and microporosity (Fig. 2\n), and import each category into Touchstone\u2122.\nThe pore space between grains that formed during deposition is counted as primary intergranular porosity (Fig. 2). Secondary porosity refers to pore space formed after deposition during diagenetic processes, such as dissolution and fracturing. Porosity formed by a combination of primary and secondary pore spaces (e.g. oversized pores), is classified with respect to the part of the oversized pore intercepted by the crosshair (Fig. 2).\nIn order to include microporosity in the study, even though it is not required as input category by Touchstone\u2122, we counted pore-filling clay minerals (i.e. illite and kaolinite) in the point-counting approach and compared it with the petrography pore-filling data, in order to give a percentage estimate of microporosity.\n\n\n3.1.1.2\nPetrographic analysis\nThe petrographic analysis is used to characterize the mineralogical composition and paragenesis of the sandstone reservoir units with particular emphasis on the diagenetic evolution. The optical petrographic analysis was performed on a thin section by a 200-point counting routine. This permits to quantify the authigenic and detrital components. For a better evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of grains during diagenesis, the framework components were divided into three classes based on their chemical and mechanical properties. Mechanically stable and chemically stable (MSCS) grains are considered to behave as rigid grains, not inclined to dissolution. To note that the sandstones analyzed in this paper are almost completely composed by quartz. Mechanically stable but chemically unstable grains (MSCU) are those prone to dissolution but not to ductile deformation, such as feldspars. Lastly, mechanically unstable and chemically unstable grains (MUCU), such as argillaceous grains and mica flakes, are prone to plastic deformation as opposed to dissolution during compaction.\nAlso, using the same approach, cement types have been classified on the basis of their mineralogy and their effect on the pore network and on the grains. Occlusive and partly occlusive cements are those ones that completely or partly fill the observed intergranular pores which may influence the pore network, such as quartz overgrowths. Moreover, the phyllosilicate cements, in particular illite, chlorite and kaolinite have been differentiated between pore lining (grain coating cements) and pore filling cements in order to better define which influence they have on the pore network and the precipitation of other cements like quartz overgrowth. Especially grain coating clay minerals have been observed to inhibit syntaxial overgrowth cement by quartz, preserving porosity while pore-filling clay mineral cements primarily occlude open porosity. Therefore, special emphasis is on the evolution of grain coating coverages and their relation to syntaxial cementation and porosity.\nFor this reason, we will focus particularly on the evolution and relation of grain coat coverages.\n\n\n3.1.1.3\nThermal models\nIn order to determine which thermal scenario best explains the previously constrained diagenetic history and experimental data, we modelled two different thermal histories. In the first thermal history, reservoir lithologies experienced heating due to burial with an additional early Cenozoic thermal overprint and a doubling of the heat flow at 65\u00a0Ma. In the second thermal history the reservoir system experienced heating related to burial with an additional late Cenozoic thermal overprint and a doubling of the heat flow at 5.4\u00a0Ma (Fig. 3\n). In order to avoid the combination and the overlap of the two thermal events, the two thermal histories have been modelled to last differently. These two end-member scenarios can be used to evaluate the possible effects of the two magmatic cycles that occurred in the region during the Cenozoic (Wilson and Guiraud, 1992), as we want to understand which magmatic cycle influenced the thermal history of the IGB basin the most, and not to constrain strictly the age of the peak.\nBoth thermal models were obtained using the Petroleum System Modelling package Simba (e-simba tool, developed by Eni S. p.a.). Simba is a software for 1D to 3D petroleum system modelling and allows to simulate processes like hydrocarbon generation, expulsion, retention, and entrapment. At first, the software constructs a geological\/geometrical model using chronostratigraphic and structural data. Then, Simba produces an inverse model of temperature (Fig. 3), pressure, hydrocarbon generation and retention patterns using the petrophysical, thermal and geochemical inputs (Schito et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n3.1.2\nDiagenetic modelling\nThe modelling of the diagenetic evolution of the reservoir units was performed using Touchstone\u2122 software. This software models the following diagenetic dominating processes: 1) compaction, illite and quartz cements precipitation, and 2) total porosity and absolute permeability changes (Taylor et al., 2022).\nTouchstone\u2122 models the diagenetic evolution of the sandstone from deposition to the present-day condition. For each analog sandstone sample included in the simulation, the model determines the depositional intergranular volume (hereafter IGV) based on grain-size, sorting and the depositional composition based on the reconstruction of dissolved and replaced grains. For each geologic timestep, compaction is modelled by considering the mechanical properties of grains and pore-filling materials as well as the effective stress at that timestep. Quartz cement precipitation at a given timestep is modelled by considering the detrital composition, extent of grain coat coverage, grain-size and the thermal history (Lander and Walderhaug, 1999; Perez et al., 1999; Lander et al., 1997, 2008). Other diagenetic processes (such as grain dissolution, carbonate cementation etc.) are modelled based on the timing and\/or temperature and their relationship to the relative timing of diagenetic events (i.e. paragenesis evolution) revealed by petrographic observations and\/or geochemical analyses. Once the simulation for a given timestep is completed, the simulation moves on to the next burial history timestep and repeats the process (for a more thorough discussion of Touchstone\u2122, see Taylor et al., 2022).\nInput data for Touchstone\u2122 includes sandstone compositional and textural data, core analysis data, and burial histories for analog samples included in the simulation. Parameters in the constituent models in Touchstone are calibrated using parameter optimization. The objective of model calibration is to find the set of model parameters that gives the best correspondence between measured and calculated values (for more details, see Touchstone\u2122 Users Guide).\nIn the presented approach, we initially calibrate two diagenetic models (one for each thermal scenario) and compare their respective model fit to assess which thermal scenario better reproduces reservoir properties. Afterwards, we perform a parameter study in which the modelling responses related to uncertainty associated to the extent of grain coating coverage are systematically highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrographic data\nGrain-size and sorting of the studied samples are variable throughout the whole dataset. Average grain-size ranges from 0.15 to 0.42\u00a0mm, whereas sorting ranges from well to very poorly sorted.\nThe main detrital component is quartz, which is 61%\u201381% of the whole rock (mean value 73%). On average, the other detrital minerals (feldspar grains, accessory minerals, matrix) account for less than 4% of the rocks. Among the authigenic minerals, the dominant cement type is quartz overgrowth which ranges from 2 to 15% of total rock (mean value 8.6%). Microporous clay minerals have an abundance between 0.5% and 3.5%, with a mean value of 2%. Point counting of porosity yields total thin section porosity values that range from 4% to 17%, while primary porosity is between 1% and 8% with a mean value of 3.6%, and secondary porosity (including secondary porosity due to grain dissolution and grain fracturing) is between 3% and 10% with a mean value of 6.8% (all data are reported in detail in the supplementary material).\n\n\n4.2\nDiagenetic modelling\n\n4.2.1\nCalibration results\nTo test whether quartz cement in our analog dataset can be used to differentiate which of the two burial history scenarios is more likely, we ran simulations using the Touchstone IGV match tool. When this option is selected, the simulation will override certain aspects of the diagenesis model configuration in an attempt to reduce the impact of errors in one model type on another (Touchstone\u2122 Users Guide). A mismatch between the measured and calculated IGV values, for example, impacts the nucleation surface area available for quartz cementation and therefore will impact the performance of the quartz cement model.\nIn Fig. 4\n are shown the quartz cement calibrations for each thermal scenario using the IGV match tool. Although simulation results using the two thermal scenarios are similar, the quartz cement model performance is slightly better when using the burial history scenario with the 5.4\u00a0Ma temperature peak. When using this burial history, 87% of the calculated values are within \u00b14\u00a0vol% of the measured values compared to 82% in the simulations using the burial history with the 65\u00a0Ma peak (Fig. 4).\nIn order to obtain a quite similar fit for the 65\u00a0Ma scenario, the model needs to stress the quartz activation energy more than in the other case, while still exhibiting an overall poorer fit.\nThe somewhat better quartz cement model performance using the 5.4\u00a0Ma burial history scenario carries through to the performance of the intergranular and total porosity models as over- or underestimation of quartz cement will lead to an over- or underestimation of porosity when the IGV is perfectly matched (Fig. 5\n).\n\n\n4.2.2\nSensitivity to grain coat coverage\nGrain coat coverage exerts a strong control on quartz cement abundance because material on the quartz grain surfaces decreases the available nucleation surface area (Heald and Larese, 1974; Pittman, 1992; Bloch et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2010; Busch et al., 2020). Since grain coating materials can be very thin and difficult to see in thin section, there can be some degree of uncertainty associated with the quantification of grain coat coverage from the petrographic analysis. In the samples used in this study, we measured grain coat coverages ranging from 10% to 60% (average 17%) (Fig. 6\n).\n\nEnglish et al. (2017a) reported grain coat coverages ranging from 15 to 46% (average 30%) and 8\u201379% (average 37%) for sandstones from two areas in more southern sector of the IGB, suggesting that grain coating in some sandstones might be greater than observed in our study wells. To assess the impact of that greater extent of grain coating coverage on the reservoir quality, we ran stochastic simulations using each burial history scenario. In these simulations we used the distribution in measured grain coat coverage, and shifted the extent of grain coating to higher values using a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 35% (Fig. 7\n).\nThe inputs for the stochastic simulations are the calibrated model parameters determined by optimization and descriptions of the variability in sandstone composition and the texture of the analog dataset (see Taylor et al., 2022 for a detailed explanation). As the calibrated model parameters must include a calibrated compaction model, we also performed again the calibrations including IGV in the model assessment (Fig. 8\n).\nThe variability in composition and texture of the analog samples is described using parametric curve fits to each modal and textural category (see Taylor et al., 2022). The results of the stochastic simulations are predicted distributions in reservoir quality parameters for a given burial history.\nThe results of the two grain coating scenarios are shown in Fig. 9\n. For simplicity, Fig. 9 shows the prediction results only for the A4 well, because its sandstones span the compositional and textural range of the entire data set. In the scenario with a higher grain coating, the distribution in predicted quartz cement shifts towards lower values for each burial history (p50 8.4\u00a0vol% vs 6.8\u00a0vol% and 8.1\u00a0vol% and 6.5\u00a0vol% for the 5.4\u00a0Ma and 65\u00a0Ma burial history scenarios, respectively). Furthermore, increasing the extent of grain coating results in an increase in predicted intergranular porosity, total porosity, and permeability.\nIn this sensitivity test we allowed only a minor increase in the extent of grain coating, however even this small increase results in a measurable difference in reservoir quality. Note that the maximum grain coat coverage that we measured in our dataset was 60% and English et al. (2017a) report a maximum grain coat coverage of 79%. To evaluate the potential impact of such higher grain coat coverage on the reservoir quality in the study area, we ran two additional scenarios for the 5.4\u00a0Ma burial history at A4 well, where we shifted the distribution in grain coat coverage so that the Gaussian distribution had a mean of 60% and a mean of 79%. A standard deviation of 5% was used for each scenario. We also included a low end-member case where we set the grain coat values to 0%.\n\nFig. 10\n compares the predicted distribution of quartz cement, intergranular porosity, total porosity, and permeability for all the grain coat scenarios used in this study. With extensive grain coating (mean coat value of 79%) it is predicted a little quartz cement (p50 2.2%) and p50 total porosity and permeability values of 19% and 940 mD, respectively. These total porosity and permeability values could be considered as maximum reservoir quality potential in the area if an extensive grain coating was present. However, based on the integrated observations from this study and from English et al. (2017a), although extensive grain coat coverage is possible it is unlikely this to be widespread in the study area.\n\n\n\n4.3\nDiagenetic evolution\nThe quartz cementation history associated with each thermal scenario is shown in Fig. 11\n together with the variation of reservoir quality expressed by porosity and permeability trends through time. For the sake of simplicity, only the results for the A4 well are shown, although results from other wells follow a similar pattern.\nIn Fig. 11A, the history of quartz cement formation is represented as function of grain coat coverage (expressed as area%) for three grain coating scenarios: 0% coat, measured coats, and mean 35% coat. Comparing these simulations, it can be seen that the less grain coat coverage considered the more quartz cement is formed, with a 2.5\u00a0vol% difference (which is approximately one quarter of the total authigenic quartz amount) between the simulations with 0% and 35% of grain coat coverage.\nThe relationship between the predicted quartz cement history and temperature history is illustrated in Fig. 11B. The quartz cement variation is almost identical for either thermal scenario until about 80\u00a0Ma, when the prediction diverges as a result of the timing and magnitude of the modelled thermal peaks. For the scenario with the thermal peak at 65\u00a0Ma, there is a rapid increase in quartz cement abundance at \u223c80\u00a0Ma. By contrast, when considering the thermal peak at 5.4\u00a0Ma, the modelled amount of quartz cement rapidly increases at about 25 million years, approximately 55\u00a0Ma later than in the previous scenario.\nLastly, the modelled evolution of porosity and permeability is plotted in Fig. 11C. As expected, both porosity and permeability evolve similarly through time until the early Cenozoic, driven by burial and the beginning of quartz cement precipitation. Instead, during Cenozoic, porosity and permeability trends diverge depending on the thermal scenario adopted. Using the peak at 65\u00a0Ma, both porosity and permeability decrease around the Cretaceous-Cenozoic boundary due to the rapid increase of quartz cement precipitation along with rapid temperature increase. Conversely, porosity and permeability drastically decrease starting at 25\u00a0Ma when the 5.4\u00a0Ma peak is considered. In the second case, this implies that the pore space system of the studied reservoir rocks suffered a significant deterioration 55 million years later, its time-step evolution is summarized in the conceptual scheme in Fig. 12\n.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nTouchstone\u2122 diagenetic modelling allowed to study the thermal history of the IGB. In particular, the new petrographic results and the new diagenetic model of a sector of the IGB contributes to solving the problem of how the Cenozoic magmatic cycles have affected the reservoir lithologies in the basin.\nAlthough the difference between the results using the two burial histories is not large, the diagenetic model results suggest that the thermal history with a temperature peak at 5.4\u00a0Ma better explains the observed quartz cement abundances in the Devonian reservoir sandstones included in this study. If the late Cenozoic burial-thermal history is the more likely, then it implies that the sandstones in the study area had better reservoir quality over the last 55 million years of the burial history compared to what we predict for the 65\u00a0Ma burial-thermal history.\nOther studies have discussed the burial and thermal history of the Illizi-Ghadames-Berkine area using other methods such as thermal maturity, sonic compaction analysis, apatite fission-track thermochronology and fluid inclusion microthermometry (English et al., 2016b, 2016c, 2017a; Underdown and Redfern, 2008). In particular, English et al. (2017a) also performed diagenetic modelling using the Touchstone\u2122 software to supplement the previous studies listed above and understand the factors affecting the reservoir quality prediction in the basin. The predicted evolution in permeability from this study and that of English et al. (2017a) are compared in Fig. 13\n.\nThe results from our study are comparable to the northernmost well studied by English et al. (2017a) (well A North, in Fig. 13), although the pattern of predicted permeability through time is different to the modelled permeability. Our modelled permeability is lower than that of well A in English et al. (2017a) from 419\u00a0Ma until the beginning of the thermal heating around 100\u00a0Ma. Instead, from \u223c100\u00a0Ma to \u223c10\u00a0Ma, we predict higher permeability.\nSince texture and composition of sandstones analyzed by English et al. (2017a) are comparable to the IGB rocks, it is possible to sustain that the major difference between the two studies is due to differences in the burial histories, which is likely a function of the wells location in the basin. Well A4 is located in the same broad area of Well A from English et al. (2017a), but they are several kilometers distant. The divergence in predicted permeability history might indicate that reservoir quality changes throughout the basin. This conclusion agrees with that of English and coauthors who support different diagenetic-thermal pathways as a result of the amount of burial and erosion across the Hercynian orogenic event in response to paleotopographic features (such as basins and highs), as well as unequal heat flow during the Cenozoic related to magmatic activity. If this is correct, the wells location with respect to the basin geometry may have a strong impact on their economic viability, considering that even relatively minor changes in thermal history lead to significant differences in reservoir quality parameters in the IGB. Consequently, an accurate description of thermal history variations is crucial to understanding reservoir quality properties throughout the entire IGB.\nIn this study, we tested only two scenarios representing the end members of the Cenozoic magmatic cycle. However, the exact age of the overheating produced by magmatism that occurred during the Miocene-Quaternary magmatic cycle remains to be investigated, and it is possible that this varies within the IGB due to the distance from the magmatic centers.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe reconstruction of the diagenetic evolution of reservoir clastic rocks from the IGB is fundamental to predict the reservoir quality. The thermal history of the IGB remains a debated subject and, as shown in this study, time-space variations in the thermal history significantly impact the pattern of reservoir quality evolution in the basin.\nThe diagenetic modelling results from this study, allow us to link the petrophysical rock changes to a late Cenozoic overheating, related to the younger Miocene-Quaternary magmatic cycle occurred in the area.\nThe present study demonstrates that the evolution of the pore network of the studied reservoir rocks changes as a function of the adopted thermal scenario, with porosity and permeability decrease linked to the rapid precipitation of quartz cement, and demonstrates as well that this significant pore space modification can even occur from place to place in the basin at times different by several tens of million years.\nFrom a methodological point of view, our work highlights the need of a careful evaluation and integration of many data types, even if some of them are commonly overlooked in routine petrographic analyses. In particular, careful study of grain coating is generally not included in a standard petrographic analysis and, as demonstrated in this study, is an important control on quartz cement abundance. In our case of study, although 67% of the samples have low grain coat coverage (\u226415%), we observed grain coatings as high as 60%. English et al. (2017a) reported even slightly higher grain coat coverages, indicating that grain coat coverage can be highly variable in the same basin and should be carefully quantified when evaluating the hydrocarbon potential of an area.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nSilvia Tamburelli, Andrea Di Giulio e Chiara Amadori conceived the scientific question, defined and performed the work and wrote the manuscript.

The global reserves (gas in place) of natural gas stored in gas hydrate reaches 3 \u223c 24.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01015\u00a0m\n3, which is approximately twice as the carbon stored in conventional fossil fuel deposits, including coal, oil and natural gas reserves (Kvenvolden, 1993). Gas hydrate may also play a significant role in areas such as climate change and geologic hazards (Waite et al., 2009). In exploring hydrate deposits, elastic moduli (bulk and shear modulus) and elastic wave velocities (compressional and shear wave velocity) prove to be critical factors in confirming the presence of hydrate in the sediments (Waite et al., 2009; Goldberg et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that the presence of hydrate can stiffen the host sediments and thus the elastic properties vary with hydrate saturation (Stoll, 1974; Priest et al., 2005; Faisal et al., 2017; Jakobsen et al., 2000; Dvorkin and Nur, 1996; Dvorkin et al., 1999; Sahoo et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018). Seismic tools were widely used for detecting the presence of a bottom simulating reflector (BSR), which proved to be the major way to identify potential gas hydrate reserves (Moridis et al., 2011; Spence et al., 2010). Therefore, a proper understanding of the relation between elastic properties and hydrate saturation is essential.\nStudies of hydrate-bearing sediments and its geophysical properties have been implemented via field cores retrieved by pressure coring techniques (Holland et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2016; Santamarina et al., 2012; Dai and Santamarina, 2014; Oshima et al., 2019; Boswell et al., 2019) and synthetic samples in the laboratory (Tohidi et al., 2001; Sahoo et al., 2018b; Stoll and Bryan, 1979; Bian et al., 2022; Priest et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007). Different imaging techniques have been applied to probe the hydrate distribution within the host sediments, such as X-Ray computed tomography (Kerkar et al., 2009, 2014; Lei et al., 2018; Chaouachi et al., 2015), cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (CSEM) (Winters et al., 2014), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Kleinberg et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2012; Bagherzadeh et al., 2011) A few conceptual models have been proposed to describe hydrate pore habits or morphologies (Waite et al., 2009; Malagar et al., 2019; Chaouachi et al., 2015; Sahoo et al., 2018a; Dai et al., 2012; Helgerud et al., 1999). The commonly discussed hydrate morphologies include pore-filling (or pore-floating), pore-bridging (or load-bearing), and cementation. The pore-filling habit is normally defined as hydrate that disperses in the pore space but not bonds adjacent solid grains. It is found that pore-filling hydrate mainly affects the stiffness of pore fluids so that the effective elastic properties of the hydrate-bearing sediment are less influenced (Waite et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2012; Helgerud et al., 1999; Berge et al., 1999; Sahoo et al., 2018a). The load-bearing morphology is formed after hydrate particles coalesce and then bridge adjacent solid grains. The load-bearing hydrate is often found when hydrate saturation reaches 25%\u201340% (Waite et al., 2009; Sahoo et al., 2018a). From the mechanical point of view, the load-bearing hydrate can support the granular skeleton and resist loads, such that the hydrate-bearing sediments can be greatly stiffened by the presence of hydrate (Waite et al., 2009; Berge et al., 1999). Cementation morphology occurs when gas hydrate is formed at grain contact points, and it can enhance the stiffness of hydrate-bearing sediments significantly even with only a few hydrate particles (Waite et al., 2009; Sahoo et al., 2018a). The cementation morphology is more likely to occur during hydrate formation under excess-gas conditions (Waite et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2012; Priest et al., 2005).\nAs determining the relation of hydrate saturation and elastic properties is hampered by the complex hydrate morphology and the lack of in-situ hydrate-bearing cores, some empirical models have been established and widely used, such as the time-average equation (Wyllie et al., 1958), Wood's equation (Wood, 1960), and weighted equation (Lee et al., 1996). These analytical models provide fast estimations of the relationship between elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities and hydrate saturation, but they fail to capture the complex fluids-solid-hydrate spatial distribution in actual hydrate-bearing sediments (Ren et al., 2020). Some more physically-based models were also developed, such as Biot-Gassmann theory (BGT) (Lee, 2002a,b), Biot-Gassmann theory modified by Lee (BGTL) (Lee, 2002b), and three-phase effective medium theory (Helgerud et al., 1999), but they usually contain some parameters that are difficult to determine.\nIn addition to the lab measurements and analytical models, supported with the most recent advanced imaging techniques, a powerful numerical tool, the finite element method, has been adopted to probe the stress field within a specific domain for a given set of constraints (Lin et al., 2019; Huaimin et al., 2018). Previous studies have demonstrated the application of the FEM in predicting the effective elastic moduli and elastic wave propagation through random composites and porous mediums (Madadi et al., 2009; Arns et al., 2002; Faisal et al., 2017; Jing and Hudson, 2002; Andr\u00e4 et al., 2013a; Dvorkin et al., 2011). The FEM includes two types, dynamic FEM and static FEM. The main difference between these two types of FEMs lies in that the static FEM does not account for non-linear cases in which: a) the stress-strain relation is non-linear (or yield stress occurs) so that the modulus of the component is strain-dependent; or b) large strains and\/or deformation appears, which changes the global geometry of the domain (Andr\u00e4 et al., 2013a). As for the prediction of elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities in hydrate-bearing rocks, the static FEM is often used. But due to the difficulty of obtaining high-resolution images of hydrate-bearing rocks, in most studies, the hydrate phase is introduced into a hydrate-free rock model through a mathematical morphology algorithm that simulates the growth and distribution of gas hydrate (Lin et al., 2019; Huaimin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021). However, this way of involving the hydrate phase cannot precisely capture the complex natures of hydrate distribution in the porous medium. Therefore, limited by the lack of precise digital information of hydrate-bearing rocks, the investigation of elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities through pore-scale numerical methods is still very rare.\nIn this study, we constructed a series of 3-D hydrate-bearing models with a wide hydrate saturation range based on the 4-D high-resolution images of a synthetic hydrate-bearing sample. Then we investigated the elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of the model and their relationship to the hydrate saturation and hydrate morphology through numerical simulations. Based on the simulated results, we proposed an empirical model that weights Wood's equation and Voigt upper bound. The model applies fast and trustworthy estimations of both compressional and shear wave velocities of hydrate-bearing sediments including free gas. Comparisons with some documented laboratory data validated the application of this analytical model.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nSample and image process\nThe 4D high-resolution images of fluids-solid-hydrate distribution during the hydrate formation process were obtained through SRXCT (Sahoo et al., 2018a). In their work, a core sample (porosity\u00a0=\u00a035%) was made of Leighton Buzzard sands with a mean grain size of 100\u00a0\u03bcm(d\n50\u00a0=\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcm). The core was saturated with 3.5\u00a0wt% brine to reach an initial brine saturation of 90%, and thus the subsequent hydrate formation would start under excess-water conditions. The entire system was then left under vacuum conditions for the pore fluids to favour a homogeneous distribution. Methane gas was then injected and a methane pressure of 10\u00a0MPa was achieved. A rigid confinement was provided to the system by a pressure cell made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK). The system was then cooled to 5\u00a0\u00b0C for hydrate formation. During the hydrate formation process, the SRXCT scanned the sample at resolutions of 1.625, 0.625 and 0.325\u00a0\u03bcm. In this work, the 3D images scanned at 16\u00a0h 42\u00a0m (1626\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01340\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300 pixels), 23\u00a0h 30\u00a0m (1830\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01788\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0500 pixels), and 45\u00a0h 10\u00a0m (1810\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01838\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0500 pixels) were collected since they were found to best describe the key hydrate formation process (Sahoo et al., 2018a), as shown in Fig. 1\n. Their resolutions are 0.625\u00a0\u03bcm, 0.325\u00a0\u03bcm, and 0.325\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively.\nDe-noising and segmentation processes were implemented to the 3D images. some noises might exist in the raw images, which shades essential details of the core sample, and hence a proper treatment of noise reduction is necessary (Andr\u00e4 et al., 2013b). Sell et al. (2016) applied different de-noising filters to reduce noises in hydrate-bearing images obtained by SRXCT and concluded that the performance of the non-local means filter and anisotropic diffusion filter was better than others. In this work, a non-local means de-noising plugin in the open-source image processing software, ImageJ, was applied to our datasets for noise reduction (Buades et al., 2011; Darbon et al., 2008). Furthermore, properly segmenting rock images into different phases is critical as it directly affects the volume fraction of each phase in the model, which is one of the main sources of uncertainties in numerical simulations (Andr\u00e4 et al., 2013b). The most commonly used thresholding method is the global thresholding method (Iassonov et al., 2009). As the greyscale value in CT images is related to the density of constituents, ideally there will be four peaks in the greyscale histogram, and these peaks represent gas (\u223c90\u00a0kg\/m3), hydrate (\u223c925\u00a0kg\/m3), water (\u223c1035\u00a0kg\/m3), and sand (\u223c2650\u00a0kg\/m3), respectively (He et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2006). Correspondingly, the thresholding values will be set at the valley between two peaks. However, it is difficult to distinguish hydrate from water in some low-resolution models due to the low-density contrast between hydrate and water (Jin et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2015). In this work, benefiting from the high resolution, we found a clear separation between the hydrate and water phases, as shown in Fig. 2\n. A global thresholding segmentation method was then used to segment the system into four phases, and the segmented models can be seen in Fig. 1. The volume fraction of each component and porosity were then calculated, as presented in Table 1\n.\nAdditionally, the resolutions of original images were reduced by resampling the voxel sizes to save the time spent in numerical simulations. As the original resolutions were very high, subsequent numerical simulations on these images would suffer from the computing cost. Therefore, the models were rescaled in ImageJ, through a bicubic interpolation algorithm (Catmull-Rom interpolation) proposed by Burger and Burge (2016). After some sensitivity tests, we reduced the resolution of images at 16hr 42\u00a0m twofold down to 1.25\u00a0\u03bcm, and the resolutions of images at both 23hr 30\u00a0m and 45hr 10\u00a0m quadruply to 1.3\u00a0\u03bcm. A typical comparison between original image and resampled image is depicted in Fig. 3\n. Consequently, the sizes of 3D images at 16hr 42\u00a0m, 23hr 30\u00a0m, and 45hr 10\u00a0m become 813\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0670\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150, 458\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0447\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0125, and 453\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0460\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0125, respectively. The porosity and volume fraction of different phases of the rescaled models were calculated, and the results are listed in Table 1. Compared with the original models, porosities, phase volume fractions, and saturations in rescaled models slightly changed by \u2212 0.06 \u223c \u2212 0.11%, \u22120.25 \u223c 0.95%, and \u22122.54 \u223c 2.69%, respectively.\nWe first determined the Representative Elementary Volumes (REV) of the segmented and rescaled high resolution hydrate-fluids-rock images, which will be used as input to investigate the effective elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities. REV is defined as the minimum volume beyond which properties sustain constant (Faisal et al., 2017). These characteristics include porosity (Rozenbaum and du Roscoat, 2014), water saturation (Costanza-Robinson et al., 2011), tortuosity (Borges et al., 2018), average pore and throat volumes (Yio et al., 2017), and fractal dimension (Wu et al., 2019), among which the porosity is the most commonly used parameter to determine the REV. In this work, we followed the same approach proposed by Wu et al. (2019) to use porosity to obtain the REV of the hydrate-bearing images. As shown in Fig. 4\n, the centre point of the rock images is selected to locate the position of the first cubic. The size of the centre cubic rock image is then incremented gradually, and the porosity of each cubic is computed. As displayed in Fig. 5\n, the calculated porosities of the generated 3D hydrate bearing images are presented as a function of image size. REVs of images at 16hr 42\u00a0m, 23hr 30\u00a0m, and 45hr 10\u00a0m are 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150, 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100, and 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100, with corresponding physical volumes of 1.8e7um\n3, 2.0e7um\n3, and 2.0e7um\n3, respectively. It is noted that the porosity in Fig. 5 (a) becomes stable at around 35% when the domain size reaches 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150 (corresponds to a physical volume of 1.8e7um\n3). In Fig. 5 (b) and Fig. 5 (c), the porosity remains constant when the volume size reaches 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 (corresponds to a physical volume of 2.0e7um\n3). Hence, the REV of the three cases is close in physical size. In this work, we chose a slightly larger volume (400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150) as its REV in Fig. 5 (a) (Fig. 5 (a) is large enough to have a bigger REV) to avoid any uncertainty resulting from local heterogeneity.\nFinally, we followed the hydrate-bearing model constructing method proposed by Chen et al. (2018), to develop a total of 24 hydrate-bearing with REV sizes by cropping original hydrate-bearing images. The locations of these sub-volumes are shown in Fig. 1. Sub-volumes 1 \u223c10 were extracted from images at 16hr 42\u00a0m, sub-volumes 11 \u223c17 were cropped from images at 23hr 30\u00a0m, and sub-volumes 18 \u223c24 were obtained from images at 45hr 10\u00a0m, respectively. The porosity and saturation information of these sub-volumes are listed in Table 2\n. The hydrate saturation of these sub-volumes ranges from 1.24 to 56.93%. The porosity fluctuates between 34.32% and 37.01%, with a maximum difference of 2.69%. Meanwhile, a set of hydrate-free models were created by duplicating these sub-volumes and treating the hydrate phase as water.\n\n\n2.2\nSimulation of elastic properties for hydrate-bearing rocks\nTo calculate effective elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of hydrate-bearing models, the static finite element method (FEM) for linear elasticity proposed by Garboczi and Day (1995) is implemented in this work. The essence of the static FEM for linear elasticity is to seek the solution of a variational formulation of the linear elastic equations by minimising the elastic energy with an iterative solver, such as the conjugate gradient method (Arns et al., 2002). The FEM algorithm used in this work is feasible for structured grid systems. Therefore, each pixel in digital images is treated as a trilinear finite element in the FEM, and thus the FEM can be directly applied to lattice digital models. Benefiting from the high resolution of the images used in this work, the structured grids can capture the complex pore space. Strain loadings are applied to the model to yield elastic deformation. Finally, the deformation field of the applied strain conditions is solved, and the effective elastic moduli are computed by the average stress and strain.\nPractically in this work, to calculate effective elastic moduli of hydrate-bearing models, we first assign the bulk and shear modulus of each constituent to the model and each element (as listed in Table 3\n).\nThe periodic boundary condition, implying that the stresses and displacements at the nodes on one edge of the medium must be identical to the corresponding nodes on the opposite edge, was applied in the finite element method simulation to avoid any boundary effect resulting from extra stress. Furthermore, six macro strains are applied (see Fig. 6\n), and six independent Finite element simulations are thus undertaken to solve for stress and displacement distributions of the six applied constant strains.The elastic displacements in each finite element are found, and thus stresses and strains in each element. Averaging the elemental stresses and strains over the entire simulation domain results in six macro stresses. Each strain constraint will yield a vector of six macro stresses. In total, six strain conditions will lead to 36 macro stresses. A stiffness tensor (in Voigt notation), C\n\nijkl\n, is used in FEM to collect all the 36 components generated by these six macro strains in one matrix (Madadi et al. 2009). Inside the matrix, each macro strain contributes to a specific row in the matrix. The final form of the stiffness tensor is:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nijkl\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere 1\u00a0=\u00a0xx, 2\u00a0=\u00a0yy, 3\u00a0=\u00a0zz, 4\u00a0=\u00a0xz, 5\u00a0=\u00a0yz, and 6\u00a0=\u00a0xy.

V\n\np\n and V\n\ns\n are the compressional and shear wave velocity.\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\n\n3.1\nHydrate distribution in pore space\n\nFig. 7\n shows 3D views of critical findings of hydrate distributions with the increase of the hydrate saturations. At a lower hydrate saturation (Fig. 7 (a)), hydrate forms around gas bubbles floating in the pore space, resulting in the formation of hydrate shells. This is because that the hydrate formation consumes both water and gas, thus hydrate tends to nucleate at the gas-water interface. As gas bubbles and gas pockets are rich sources of free gas, hydrate will preferentially form around them (Sahoo et al., 2018a). Additionally, some hydrate blocks can form when hydrate saturation is low (Fig. 7 (b)). Water separates the hydrate and solid grains, such that hydrate shells and hydrate blocks are floating in the pore space. Finally, when a significant amount of hydrate clusters coalesce, the hydrate framework forms, which blocks the most pore space (Fig. 7 (c)). Some scattered free gas bubbles remain in the hydrate framework even when hydrate saturation reaches 56.93%. This is because that the formation of hydrate shells around gas bubbles can inhibit the water outside from consuming inner gas to create new gas hydrates (Sahoo et al., 2018a). Furthermore, water films are always present that enclose hydrate solid, which separates the matrix and hydrate.\nA more detailed 2D view of the evolution of hydrate with hydrate saturations is depicted in Fig. 8\n. As shown in this figure, the hydrate pore habit is evolving with hydrate saturation and can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, gas hydrate forms around gas bubbles and gas pockets, resulting in the formation of hydrate shells and hydrate blocks when hydrate saturation is very low (see Fig. 8 (a) \u223c(d)). In the second stage, a massive amount of hydrate is present in the centre of the pore space, exhibiting a pore-filling hydrate morphology (see Fig. 8 (e) \u223c(h)). In the third stage, the hydrate clusters coalesce, forming large hydrate blocks that eventually occupies most of the pore space (see Fig. 8 (i) \u223c(l)). In addition, a thin water film is present between hydrate and solid surface even when hydrate saturation is very high (as highlighted in Fig. 8 (j)). Also, some gas bubbles can remain inside the hydrate chunks (see Fig. 8 (l)).\n\n\n3.2\nElastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of hydrate-bearing models\n\nFig. 9\n depicts the elastic wave velocities and effective elastic moduli of hydrate-bearing models and hydrate-free models. As shown in this figure, the hydrate-bearing models have higher elastic wave velocities and elastic moduli than the hydrate-free models because the gas hydrate stiffens the host sediments. Elastic wave velocities and elastic moduli of hydrate-bearing models all increase with higher hydrate saturation, which makes the difference between hydrate-bearing models and hydrate-free models greater. Notably, for the shear wave velocity and shear modulus, the hydrate-bearing and hydrate-free models overlap when hydrate saturation is less than 10%. While the difference in compressional wave velocity and bulk modulus between hydrate-bearing and hydrate-free models is quite high when hydrate saturation is very low. In addition, the elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of hydrate-free models are not stable since the geometry of these 24 sub-volumes are different. But since this difference is very low compared to it caused by the increase of hydrate saturation, the influence of different geometry on the elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of the hydrate-bearing models can be neglected.\n\nFig. 10\n shows the difference in bulk modulus, shear modulus, compressional and shear wave velocities between hydrate-bearing and hydrate-free models. The point (0, 0) is fixed in both figures since the hydrate-bearing model becomes identical to the hydrate-free model when hydrate saturation equals 0.\nAs shown in Fig. 10 (a) and (b), the change in elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities are similar, as elastic wave velocities are positively related. \u0394K, \u0394G, \u0394V\n\np\n and \u0394V\n\ns\n all increase with higher hydrate saturation. According to the slope of the trend line presenting in bulk modulus and compressional wave velocity, the results can be classified into four stages. They are an initial increase (S\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a00 \u223c 5%), a flat rise (S\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a05 \u223c 35%), a steeper growth (S\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a035 \u223c 50%), and a plateau (S\n\nh\n\u00a0>\u00a050%).\nSpecifically, a sharp increase of both \u0394K and \u0394V\n\np\n occurs at low hydrate saturation. Some previous studies have reported similar findings when synthesising hydrate-bearing rock samples under excess-gas conditions (Waite et al., 2004, 2009; Dai et al., 2012; Priest et al., 2005, 2009; Xing et al., 2020). This is because that hydrate initially cements grain contacts and stiffens the host sediments. It is also suggested that this sharp increase of elastic modulus at small hydrate saturation could be triggered by the fact that the hydrate preferentially forms in some micro-fractures at the beginning of the hydrate formation process, which stiffens the host sediments remarkably (Sahoo et al., 2018a). However, in this work, we ascribe this sharp enhancement to the formation of hydrate shells and hydrate blocks. The existence of free gas will greatly reduce the compressional wave velocity, and the formation of hydrate shells can dampen this reduction (Lei et al., 2019). Hence, as hydrate preferentially forms around gas bubbles, it can cause a significant increase of bulk modulus and compressional wave velocity. Meanwhile, as observed from Fig. 8, some hydrates can form large chunks that locally block adjacent solid grains. This local block may also enhance host sediments stiffness. But no initial increase in shear modulus and shear wave velocity is identified. This is due to the water films that separate the hydrate and solid grains so that the shear modulus and shear wave velocity are less influenced.\nFollowing is a flat rise in both elastic moduli and sound wave velocities that continues until hydrate saturation reaches around 35%. In this period, a large amount of gas hydrate forms in the pore space and exhibits a dominant pore-filling morphology (Priest et al., 2005; Xing et al., 2020). As a majority of hydrate particles are floating in the pore space, they hardly enhance the stiffness of the host sediments.\nA steeper increment occurs when hydrate saturation is higher than 35%. In this period, hydrate particles coalesce and form an inter-pore hydrate framework that interlocks with the solid grains. The rise in the growth rate of elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities marks a transition of hydrate morphology from pore-filling to load-bearing.\nFinally, a plateau is reached when hydrate saturation exceeds 50%, indicating that hydrate framework blocks the pore space so that little hydrate will form due to lack of source of enough free gas and water.\n\n\n3.3\nComparison with analytical modelling of elastic wave velocities\nThe simulated elastic wave velocities are compared with those calculated by the analytical models. Fig. 11\n displays the contrast of compressional wave velocities obtained from the time-average equation (Wyllie et al., 1958) (see Appendix A.1), Wood's equation (Wood, 1960) (see Appendix A.2), and our simulation. As shown in Fig. 11 (a), both the Time-average and Wood's equation underestimate the compressional wave velocity, especially for Wood's equation that yields a significantly lower prediction. It is because both equations are sensitive to the lighter components. In Wood's equation, the gas phase term on the right side, f\n\ng\n\/K\n\ng\n can be orders of magnitude higher than other terms. Though the gas phase term in the Time-average equation (f\n\ng\n\/V\n\ng\n) has less influence, it can still be much higher than other terms. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 11 (b), the compressional wave velocity computed by Wood's equation decreases at first and then increases, which is correlated with the trend of the gas volume fraction. It demonstrates that the gas concentration affects Wood's equation dramatically even though it is quite low in the hydrate-bearing models. Hence when involving the free gas phase, both Time-average and Wood's equation will underestimate the compressional wave velocity of hydrate-bearing sediments.\nThe simulated elastic wave velocities are then compared with the weighted equation (Lee et al., 1996; Lee and Collett, 2001) (see Appendix A.3) and BGT model (Krief, 1990; Lee, 2002a) (see Appendix A.4). As depicted in Fig. 12\n, the simulated elastic wave velocities are within the BGT predictions (pore-filling and load-bearing case), indicating that the hydrate morphology is a mix of pore-filling and load-bearing morphology. However, when hydrate saturation is less than 30%, the simulated compressional wave velocity exceeds the BGT predictions. This is because that the BGT model cannot accurately capture the complex hydrate morphology when hydrate saturation is low. The BGT model assumes that the hydrate is homogeneously distributed as part of either the solid matrix (load-bearing case) or the fluid (pore-filling case). At a lower hydrate saturation, the volume fraction of hydrate dominants the magnitude of the elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities in the BGT model rather than hydrate morphology. Hence, when hydrate saturation is low, the elastic wave velocities will not change greatly. But in practice, hydrate shells and hydrate blocks can stiffen the host sediments. Thus the simulated elastic wave velocity is higher than the BGT predictions at a lower hydrate saturation.\nNotably, the simulated shear wave velocities match the load-bearing case of BGT model calculations at lower hydrate saturations (see Fig. 12). It seems that the initial hydrate morphology tends to be load-bearing, which is contradictory to what has been found from Fig. 10. In addition, the shear wave velocity calculated by the pore-filling case was found to exceed the load-bearing case at low hydrate saturations. This abnormal feature is due to limitations inherent in the two different hydrate treatment methods of the BGT model. Taking the hydrate-bearing model (Label 8 in Table 2) as an example, the matrix bulk and shear modulus are calculated by Equation A.8, and they are 33.81\u00a0GPa and 37.67\u00a0GPa in load-bearing case. The matrix in the pore-filling case has only quartz, hence, the matrix bulk and shear modulus are the same as those of quartz, 36\u00a0GPa and 44.54\u00a0GPa. In the load-bearing case, treating the hydrate as part of the matrix reduces the porosity from 35.14% to 33.10%, while it is 35.14% in the pore-filling case. As a result, the effective bulk and shear modulus in the load-bearing case are 9.88\u00a0GPa and 8.17\u00a0GPa, while they are 9.81\u00a0GPa and 8.59\u00a0GPa in the pore-filling case. The bulk moduli of the two cases show no great difference, thus when calculating the elastic wave velocities using Equation (3), the shear modulus dominates the result. The compressional and shear wave velocity are 3166\u00a0m\/s and 1986 m\/s in the load-bearing case, while in the pore-filling case, they are 3202\u00a0m\/s and 2036 m\/s. From this example, we can find that treating the hydrate as part of the matrix will significantly reduce the matrix stiffness, especially the shear modulus. Nonetheless, the porosity reduction brought by the hydrate treatment method can increase the rock stiffness. Therefore, at low hydrate saturations (less than around 15% in Fig. 12), the load-bearing case does not exceed the pore-filling case in which treating the hydrate as a fluid phase increases the stiffness of the fluid and thus the entire system.\nThe weighted equation can generate a reasonable compressional wave velocity after properly tuning the free parameters. As both Time-average and Wood's equation underestimate the compressional wave velocity, the weighting factor has to be negative to match the simulated results. In our case, a negative weighting factor of W\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.2 is used in the weighted equation. In addition, the weighted equation yields shear wave velocities that are much lower than the simulated and the BGT modelling results.\n\n\n3.4\nAn improved model for effective elastic wave velocities in hydrate-bearing sediments\nIn order to analytically calculate the effective elastic wave velocities when including free gas phase, we evoked a Voigt bound for elastic wave velocity replacing the Time-average equation in the weighted equation. The Voigt bound is used for predicting elastic moduli of the composite. It assumes that all the components in the composite are arranged in series, thus it normally gives the maximum possible elastic moduli of the composite (Hill, 1963). We adapted the Voigt bound for calculating elastic wave velocities, which is expressed as\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngas\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwater\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhydrate\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolid\n\n\n\n\nwhere Vp,\ns\n is either the compressional or shear wave velocity. In this equation, the product of the gas volume fraction and elastic wave velocity is much lower than the term of the stiffest components, and thus the influence of the gas phase on the elastic wave velocities is less prominent. As a result, the effective wave velocities are affected more by the stiffer components, so that this model can overestimate the wave velocities. As shown in Fig. 11, the compressional wave velocity calculated by equation (4) is much higher than the simulated results and other empirical modelling results.\nCombining with Wood's equation, an updated weighted equation for predicting elastic wave velocities of the hydrate-bearing sediments considering the free gas phase is expressed as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n\n\n=\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n,\n1\n\n\nW\n\n\nS\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nV\n\n\np\n,\ns\n,\n3\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\nW\n\n)\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nW\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\nS\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere V\n\np\n,\ns\n,1 is the wave velocity computed from Wood's equation, and V\n\np\n,\ns\n,3 is the wave velocity computed from equation (4). A lithification parameter n that controls the contribution of hydrate concentration to the lithification rate of the sediments is included in this weighted equation. Particularly, in calculating the shear wave velocity, Wood's equation yields a zero value, and the effective shear wave velocity is then determined only by the second term on the right side of equation (5).\nThe elastic wave velocities computed by equation (5) are shown in Fig. 12. Contrast to the previous weighted equation (Appendix A.3), equation (5) matches both compressional and shear wave velocity reasonably after finely tuning the weighting factor (W\u00a0=\u00a00.15 and n\u00a0=\u00a00.2).\nEquation (5) was then used without free gas phase to match with experimental data proposed by Priest et al. (2005) (Fig. 13\n (a)), Priest et al. (2009) (Fig. 13 (b)), Hu et al. (2010) (Fig. 13 (c)), and Chen et al. (2021) (Fig. 13 (d)). The elastic properties of different components in equation (5) came from the corresponding literatures. Priest et al. (2005) measured elastic wave velocities of thirteen sand specimens with different amount of hydrate formed by the \u2018ice-seeding\u2019 method (Fig. 13 (a)). As such the hydrate was formed under an excess-gas condition, and no remaining free water after the hydrate formation process was hypothesised. Therefore, the elastic wave velocities quickly increase at low hydrate saturations, which implies that hydrate cements sand contacts. Priest et al. (2009) also constructed hydrate-bearing sand specimens by excess-water condition and measured the elastic wave velocities (Fig. 13 (b)). In both cases, equation (5) yields V\n\np\n and V\n\ns\n which are consistent with the measurement data. However the model works less adequately at low hydrate saturations in Fig. 13 (a), implying that the calculation of V\n\ns\n by the model is more suitable in excess-water conditions.\nThe analytical model was further applied to a hydrate-bearing Mullite sample (Hu et al. (2010), Fig. 13 (c)) and hydrate-bearing sand sample with different methane fluxes (Chen et al. (2021), Fig. 13 (d)). We found a great consistency of both V\n\np\n and V\n\ns\n between the model predictions and these laboratory measurements.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThe recent advanced imaging techniques make it possible to visualise the pore-scale hydrate morphology evolution in hydrate-bearing rocks. This study adopts the finite element method to simulate the in-situ stress and strain distribution in hydrate-bearing rock (under various hydrate saturations) at pore scale based on 4D high-resolution synchrotron radiation images. The effective elastic moduli and elastic wave velocities of hydrate-bearing models are calculated based on simulated stress and strain distributions at different stages during the hydrate formulation process. This allows us to investigate the influence of pore-scale hydrate morphology on geophysical properties, such as elastic wave velocities, and to formulate a more realistic geophysical function for better hydrate formulation evaluation.\nThe simulation results demonstrate the dependency of geophysical properties on pore-scale hydrate morphology under varied hydrate saturation conditions. Based on this work, a few key conclusions can be summarised as follows:\nThe dominant hydrate morphology experiences a transition from pore-filling morphology to load-bearing morphology and to interconnect hydrate framework at the hydrate formulation process. Hydrate nucleates around gas bubbles and gas pockets dispersed in the pore space at low hydrate saturation (smaller than 10%), forming hydrate shells and chunks that locally block adjacent pore space.\nThe formation of local hydrate blocks at low hydrate saturation can increase the bulk modulus and compressional wave velocity of the host sediments significantly. While the shear modulus and shear wave velocity are less affected due to the presence of water films that separate the hydrate and solid grains.\nThe existing time-average and Wood's equation underestimate the compressional wave velocity when considering the free gas phase. The weighted time-average and Wood's equation fail to predict shear wave velocity appropriately when involving the free gas.\nThe newly proposed Wood's and Voigt bound weighted equation was first validated against laboratory-measured elastic wave velocity without gas, and it also demonstrates better estimations in both compressional and shear wave velocity.\nIn this work, we demonstrated the feasibility of constructing hydrate-bearing models with different hydrate saturations based on selecting sub-volumes of different locations and hydrate formation times. Although these hydrate-bearing models vary in porosity and are constructed from different locations, we constrained the change in porosity and drew our conclusions from elastic properties differences, which to the best extent diminishes the influence of varying porosity and domain locations. But an ideal attempt is to develop hydrate-bearing models based on digital images from the same location and different hydrate formation times during the hydrate formation process. This work is limited to hydrate formulation in unconsolidated sandy sediments, and hence a natural extension of this work is to look at the geophysical properties evolution in more complicated natural porous materials, such as consolidated sandstones, fine sandy sediments and fractured rocks, as well as hydrate dissolution process.\n\n","7":"","8":"","9":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Vienna Basin (VB) formed at the Alpine\u2013Carpathian junction during the Neogene and underwent a complex tectonic history. The about 200\u00a0km long and 60\u00a0km wide basin is interpreted as extensional basin, initiated by lateral extrusion of the Eastern Alps (Decker et al., 2005; Hinsch et al., 2005; Siedl et al., 2020). The frequently cited pull-apart mechanism as proposed by Royden (1985) was not supported by seismic data (Siedl et al., 2020). The basin is composed of several horst and graben structures forming different subbasins (Fig. 1\n), each with its own geodynamic evolution and deviating paleobathymetric developments during the Miocene. The Miocene tectonic subsidence evolution of the VB has been discussed in detail by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and Lee and Wagreich (2016, 2017). Kranner et al. (2021) analyzed the paleobathymetric development during the marine phases of the VB from the Lower Miocene Ottnangian to the Middle Miocene Sarmatian but not for the Upper Miocene due to the lack of foraminifers. The Upper Miocene Pannonian deposits correspond to the Tortonian of the standard chronostratigraphy (Fig. 2\n) and have been integrated also by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and Lee and Wagreich (2016, 2017) in their analyses. These authors focused on the change of the tectonic regime from piggyback basin to extensional systems during the Early and Middle Miocene.\nThe Pannonian deposits of the Vienna Basin reflect a broad range of depositional environments ranging from beach ridges, sandwaves, river channels, delta lobes to deep lacustrine offshore marls (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1998; Harzhauser et al., 2003, 2004; Borzi et al., 2022). The rapid endemic evolution of its mollusc fauna allows for a detailed biostratigraphic subdivision of Pannonian strata (Papp, 1951; Magyar et al., 1999a, 1999b; Magyar, 2021). Harzhauser et al. (2004) correlated the letter zones of Papp (1951) (Zones A to H) with lithological units in wells G\u00f6sting 4 and Eichhorn 1 and subdivided these according to well log patterns. This scheme is applied herein to resolve and correlate a large part of the Pannonian strata spanning for the first time parts of the northern, central and northern part of the southern VB (Fig. 1).\nCross-correlations of well logs in the VB are hampered by the different tectonic settings in the various subbasins during the Early Miocene and most of the Middle Miocene (Kranner et al., 2021). This situation changed with the Sarmatian when well log patterns can be correlated across large parts of the then shallow basin (Harzhauser and Piller, 2004a, 2004b). These studies showed, that the Upper Miocene is better suited for these correlations as the influence of faults was weaker then compared the early to middle Miocene. Consequently, the well logs display similar patterns throughout the VB.\nLittle is known about the Late Miocene tectonic regime in the VB. This study tries to get a better understanding by using well log correlation. Our work aims for integrating wells from the most important hydrocarbon production fields in the Austrian part of the VB to detect lateral changes in sediment thickness. These data are transferred into sedimentation rates to trace regional differences in subsidence across an about 100-km-long NE\u2013SW trending transect. This on its turn will provide new information on the tectonic evolution of the VB.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pannonian succession of the Vienna Basin is divided into the lacustrine Bzenec Formation, which is linked to Lake Pannon, and the Cary and Gbely formations, which formed in floodplain environments (\u010ctyrok\u00fd, 2000; Harzhauser et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). A biostratigraphic zonation of the Pannonian of the Vienna Basin was developed by Papp (1951), who used letters for the zones. The Bzenec Formation comprises the lower Pannonian units A to C of Papp (1951) and the middle Pannonian units D and E of Papp (1951) (units A\u2013E in Figs. 2, 3\u20136). The Cary Formation corresponds to unit F of Papp (1951) and the Gbely Formation covers the units G and H of Papp (1951). Sedimentation was continuous from units A to F. A hiatus might separate the Cary Formation from the Gbely Formation based on biostratigraphic data (Harzhauser et al., 2004) but seismic data are too poor for these shallow units to detect erosional features (Fig. 7B).\nThe Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg fields are the northernmost hydrocarbon production areas in the investigation area (Fig. 1). They are bound in the west by the Steinberg Fault and by the Eichhorn-Rabensburg High in the east. Wells are partly positioned on an uplifted block (e.g., Bernhardsthal 5, 6, 7, Rabensburg 2) and partly on a downthrown block (e.g., Rabensburg 11, Paltendorf 1, T1) (Figs. 3 and 7\nA). The Zistersdorf Depression and the Moravian Central Depression form major depocenters in this region. The Steinberg Fault is also the western border of the Paltendorf field, which is internally structured by the Zistersdorf and the Droesing depressions and the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst. The Spannberg and Pirawarth fields are situated north of the Spannberg Ridge and the Matzen High. The area is bounded to the NW by the Pirawarth Fault. South of the Matzen High and the Spannberg Ridge follow the Bockflie\u03b2, Matzen and Aderklaa fields. Their western border is formed by the Aderklaa-Bockflie\u00df Fault. The Aderklaa High forms an important high zone. The Schwechat field is the southernmost investigated region and is characterized by the Schwechat Depression. Its western boundary is formed by the Leopoldsdorf Fault and the Oberlaa High. To the east, the Schwechat Depression is bounded by the Markgrafneusiedl Fault and the Enzersdorf High.\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\n\n3.1\nWell logs\nThe company OMV provided well log data for Resistivity (RES), Spontaneous Potential (SP) and Gamma Radiation (GR) for Pannonian strata of 36 wells with a sample resolution of about 15\u00a0cm (Figs. 3\u20136\n\n\n\n). The selected wells cover a roughly NE-SW trending cross-section through the Austrian part of the VB, crossing several of the most important hydrocarbon production fields (Fig. 1); see Kranner et al. (2021) for descriptions of the fields). Table 1\n provides the acronyms of the wells and lists the thicknesses for the Pannonian units. Quaternary deposits have not been distinguished because these are not well constrained in the wells due to their minor thickness. Thus, the thickness of the uppermost unit in each well may be slightly uncertain.\nThe resistivity log is an electrical well log, which reflect the resistivity of the drilled sediments and is measured in ohm-meter (\u03a9m). Resistivity is generally high in sandstones and comparatively low in shales (Evenick, 2008). The spontaneous potential log measures the natural or spontaneous potential difference between the given depth in the borehole and the surface in millivolts. The SP log has no absolute scale and only relative changes in the SP values are relevant. The SP log is often read against the shale base line, which is defined by the highest SP values in impermeable shales (right side in the illustrated SP logs). This is opposed by the sand line with the lowest SP signals in clean sands (left side in the illustrated SP logs). Gamma radiation is available only for well Spannberg 21. Gamma radiation in well logs is mainly based on the presence of potassium 40, uranium, and thorium. In sedimentary facies, these elements are often associated with clays and these sediments will generally have a higher GR signal than sand and gravel. The presence of fresh\/salt water and the presence of hydrocarbons may complicate these rule-of-thumbs interpretations of RES and SP logs. Nevertheless, the lithologies of the numerous cores that have been drilled in the VB proof that high RES\/low SP values indicate sand and gravel whereas low RES\/high SP values correspond to clay and marl successions (see Asquith et al., 2004 and Evenick, 2008 for an in-depth discussion on electro logs). The investigated well logs display characteristic successions of high\/low SP\/RES values, with characteristic shale line intervals, which allow for an intra-basin correlation as presented in Figs. 3\u20136. These shale line intervals represent flooding surfaces, which are basin-wide phenomena. In addition, we use a subdivision of the logs (units A\u2013G), which corresponds to the terminology of Papp (1951) and Harzhauser et al. (2004).\nSediment thickness of the units is measured along the wells assuming vertical wells. In some cases, units are incomplete due to synsedimentary erosion. The full data set on thicknesses of units in the investigated wells is given in Table 1.\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic data\nA 3D seismic survey is available for the entire region. Seismic data of several seismic vintages (1994\u20132013) were merged to an approximately 1800\u00a0km2 seismic survey called Vienna Basin Super Merge (VBSM). The extension of the VBSM is shown in Fig. 1. Seismic processing was performed by OMV in-house between May 2012 and February 2014. For details on the VBSM and numerous 2D cross-sections see Siedl et al. (2020). Seismic allows for cross-correlation within hydrocarbon fields but in many cases strong tectonic deformation hampers a straightforward correlation of horizons between uplifted and downthrown blocks (see Fig. 7). Moreover, the seismic resolution for the uppermost 200\u00a0m is very poor, because the seismic survey focused on deeper strata. Therefore, especially the Cary and Gbely formations are not well resolved by seismics and the interpretation relies mainly on well logs.\nThe sediment thicknesses have not been corrected for compaction, because no porosity data are available. Thus, the calculated vertical thickness is based on the in situ (gravitational compacted) thickness and do not represent the paleo-thickness. Consequently, the calculated sedimentation rates have to be read as underestimations.\n\n\n3.3\nBiostratigraphic data\n55 samples have been taken from cores in the core-shed in G\u00e4nserndorf (Austria) for micropaleontological analysis and for the detection of macrofossils. All samples were treated with diluted H2O2 (12%) for several hours and sieved with tap water through a standard set of sieves (500, 250, 125 and 63\u00a0\u03bcm) and later on oven dried at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. 10 samples have been analyzed for Calcareous Nannoplankton. All samples were treated for few seconds in an ultrasonic bath. Afterwards smear slides were made drying few drops of suspension on the object glass and fixed using Canada balsam. All smear slides were investigated with a Leica microscope with 1000 magnification. The identified foraminifers and molluscs are given in appendix 1 (barren samples are not shown); data on calcareous nannoplankton are given in appendix 2.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the software PAST version 4.05 (Hammer et al., 2001).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nWell log correlations\nThe position of Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary was defined in previous projects (e.g. Harzhauser et al., 2004; Borzi et al., 2022) based on the disappearance of marine fossils and the appearance of lacustrine ostracods and molluscs.\n\nUnits A\u2013B: The boundary is often indicated by a short interval of high amplitude RES values of up to about 20\u00a0m (basal part of blue unit in Figs. 3\u20136). This unit corresponds to unit A of Harzhauser et al. (2004) and can be identified easily, where it overlies Sarmatian shale line logs (e.g., Matzen 303, Sch\u00f6nkirchen 233) but is difficult to detect where it follows Sarmatian channel fills (e.g., Strasshof 2, Raasdorf 1). In these cases, we include unit A in unit B. This unit is well developed in southern wells but is absent in northern wells. The boundary between the Sarmatian and Pannonian deposits corresponds to the sequence boundary SB1 of Borzi et al. (2022).\nUnit A is followed by a unit of low RES and SP values, corresponding to zone B of Papp (1951) and unit B of Harzhauser et al. (2004). Unit B is very variable in thickness. In northern fields, it attains only few tens of meters of thickness (e.g., Bernhardsthal wells, Fig. 3) or may even be missing (Rab 2, Rab 10). It is more prominent in the Paltendorf field (m\u00a0=\u00a085\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a025.7\u00a0m) (Fig. 3), slightly thinner again in the Pirawarth, Spannberg and Bockflie\u03b2 fields (m\u00a0=\u00a059\u00a0m; \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a023.5\u00a0m) (Figs. 4 and 8\n) and increases rapidly from the Matzen field (m\u00a0=\u00a078\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a036.8\u00a0m) (Fig. 5), via the Aderklaa field (m\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a078.3\u00a0m) (Figs. 6 and 7C) to the Schwechat field (m\u00a0=\u00a0262\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0111.4\u00a0m) (Fig. 7). Especially in the southern part of the basin this unit has a characteristic shale line appearance (e.g., Raasdorf 1, Breitenlee 1, Rutzendorf 1) and is subdivided there by a flooding surface (Fig. 6). In northern wells, this unit displays also high amplitude RES values.\n\nUnits C\u2013D1: A short but marked shale line interval separates unit B from unit C1, corresponding to a major flooding surface (= mfs 1 in Borzi et al., 2022). Above this marker bed follows an up to 260-m-thick unit of funnel-shaped or blocky RES and SP logs, characterized by high frequency and high amplitude RES values typically mirrored by SP logs with lower amplitude fluctuations. Unit C1 has an average thickness of 147\u00a0m (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a043.1\u00a0m) and displays a slight NE-SW trend towards a higher thickness with a maximum in the Aderklaa and Schwechat fields (262\u00a0m in Strasshof 2) (Fig. 6). Unit C2 is bracketed by two marked flooding surfaces and represents a single funnel-to serrated cylinder-shaped unit often with coarsening upwards trend. Its mean thickness ranges around 60\u00a0m with moderate variability (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a014.0\u00a0m). Its lowest thickness of about 45\u00a0m is developed in the Paltendorf and Pirawarth fields but no thickness trend was established. Units C3 to C5 comprises about five to six, serrated, funnel-shaped sequences with distinct coarsening upwards trends and high RES values. The sequences often form three more distinct units (e.g., Paltendorf 1, Pirawarth 3, Bockflie\u03b2 15, Aderklaa 78) but may be largely amalgamated into a serrated cylinder-shaped succession especially in the southern wells (e.g., Rutzendorf 1, Mannsdorf 1) (Fig. 6). In some wells, the SP-log of unit C5 is vaguely bell shaped (e.g., Bockflie\u03b2 7, Bockflie\u03b2 17, Kagran 7) (Fig. 6). The thickness of C3, C4, C5 ranges around 42\u00a0m, 36\u00a0m and 45\u00a0m on average with a standard deviation of 10\u201312\u00a0m. The merged thickness of all three units does not show a general trend but a slightly higher thickness is observed in the Paltendorf Field. Another flooding surface separates units C3\u2013C5 from units C6\u2013D2, which again comprise a succession of broad, funnel-shaped to barrel-shaped sequences. These are often well separated into three to four units by short high SP\/low RES intervals forming a distinct serration (e.g., Aderklaa 78, Deutschwagram 2) (Figs. 5 and 6) but may form blocky, amalgamated units in southern wells (e.g., Rutzendorf 1, Wittau 1, Mannsdorf 1) (Fig. 6). Individual units display a similar average thickness (C6\u00a0=\u00a038\u00a0m, C7\u00a0=\u00a031\u00a0m, D1\u00a0=\u00a037\u00a0m) and a comparable variability in thickness (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a08\u201314\u00a0m). The thickness of units C6\u2013D1 is rather constant across most of the fields except for the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields with a distinctly lower thickness.\n\nUnits D2\u2013E: Units D1, E1, E2, E3 and E4 are characterized by funnel-to serrated cylinder-shaped sequences with high RES and low SP amplitudes. These units are often blocky and amalgamated, thus complicating cross-correlations, but may also form well separated funnel-shapes sequences (e.g., Eichhorn 1, Spannberg 21) (Figs. 4 and 5). The average thickness is similar for all five units (D2\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0m, E1\u00a0=\u00a044\u00a0m, E2\u00a0=\u00a048\u00a0m, E3\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0m, E4\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0m) with a standard deviation around 12\u201316\u00a0m. Unit D2 attains its maximum thickness in the Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields and becomes thinner towards the south. Similarly, unit E2 displays an overall NE-SW trend towards a lower thickness with a drop in the Bockflie\u03b2 region, which is also evident for unit E4. Consequently, the entire package of units D2 to E4 shows a clear trend from a higher thickness of about 250\u00a0m in the Bernhardsthal, Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields via an intermediate thickness of 213\u00a0m in the Pirawarth, Spannberg, Bockflie\u03b2 fields to a slightly lower thickness of about 200\u00a0m in the Matzen, Aderklaa and Schwechat fields.\n\nUnit F: Units F1 and F2 represent serrated bell-shaped curves (e.g., Paltendorf 1, Ringelsdorf 2, Spannberg 21, Deutschwagram 2) followed by a moderately funnel-to cylinder-shaped unit F3 (e.g., Rabensburg 11, Ringelsdorf 2). Whilst unit F1 is present in all fields, units F2 and F3 have a restricted distribution and F3 is limited to the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields (Fig. 3). The average thickness of F1 is 61\u00a0m, 57\u00a0m for F2 and 53\u00a0m for F3 with a standard deviation around 13\u00a0m (F1) and 21\u201323\u00a0m (F2, F3). Unit F1 displays a slight NE-SW trend of decreasing thickness and unit F2, too, shows a distinct decrease in thickness from the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields towards the more southern fields.\n\nUnit G: The topmost units G1, G2 and G3 are only documented from Rabensburg 11, Paltendorf 1, Paltendorf T1 and Ringelsdorf 2 (Fig. 3). These units are moderately serrated cylinder-shaped to vaguely bell-shaped and attain about 69\u00a0m (G1; \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a013.2\u00a0m) and 80\u00a0m (G2, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a010.0\u00a0m) in thickness. Unit G3 is incomplete in all available records but attains at least 70\u00a0m in thickness. Seismic data of Borzi et al. (2022) document the presence of deltaic bodies in the lower Pannonian and a decreasing occurrence of clinoforms thereafter (Fig. 7). Instead, continuous reflectors predominate in the middle and upper Pannonian (Figs. 7 and 8). Fault related differences in sediment thickness were detected by Borzi et al. (2022) within the deltaic bodies mainly along the Steinberg Fault System along the northwestern margin of the VB. These faults, however, did not play a role for the herein observed trends.\nThe trends in sediment thickness for most units can only be documented from well data, first, because the resolution of the seismic data does not capture these differences reliably and second, because the faults make it difficult to trace single horizons across larger distances.\n\n\n4.2\nBiostratigraphic correlations\nSamples spanning the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary and samples from units B and C1 were analyzed to test the correlation of the wells. The samples were investigated for foraminifers, ostracods, molluscs and nannofossils. Typical upper Sarmatian assemblages of the Porosononion granosum ecobiozone (Papp et al., 1974) have been detected in Rabensburg 2 (710\u2013920\u00a0m), Rabensburg 10 (1000\u00a0m), Rabensburg 11 (1202\u20131580\u00a0m), Spannberg 2 (880 and 1000\u00a0m), Spannberg 21 (866\u00a0m), Pirawarth 003 (725, 730\u00a0m), Pirawarth 005 (765\u00a0m), Zwerndorf 004 (1010\u00a0m), Aderklaa 78 (1250\u00a0m) and Mannsdorf 1 (1075\u00a0m). Deutschwagram 2 (830\u00a0m) yielded mollusc assemblages with Mohrensternia, which is characteristic for lower Sarmatian strata (Papp et al., 1974; Harzhauser and Piller, 2004a, 2004b). Ostracod assemblages with Pannonian Cytherideidae and Candonidae were detected in Aderklaa 78 (820\u00a0m), Deutschwagram 002 (725\u00a0m), Rabensburg 10 (730\u00a0m) and Mannsdorf 1 (820\u2013950\u00a0m). Pannonian lymnocardiid bivalves were recorded from Matzen 109 (690\u00a0m) and Sch\u00f6nkirchen 233 (545\u00a0m) and Pannonian molluscs (e.g., Pisidium sp., Parvidacna? viennense (Papp, 1953) and Pontodreissena minima (Andrusov, 1900)) derive from Rabensburg 10 (730\u00a0m). The investigated nannofossil assemblages are generally dominated by rare and poorly preserved specimens, which were reworked from Cretaceous and\/or Paleocene to middle Miocene strata; e.g., the Cretaceous Micula staurophora (Gardet, 1955) Stradner, 1963 was recorded in Bo 17 (1180\u20131195\u00a0m), Ma 109 (690\u2013695\u00a0m), Sch\u00f6 50 (549\u00a0m). Autochthonous nannofossils are rarely preserved. Dw 2 (510\u2013516\u00a0m) and DwK 3 (725\u2013730\u00a0m) yield the endemic Praenoelaerhabdus banatensis Mihajlovic, 1993, which is indicative for an early Pannonian age (Marunteanu, 1997; Botka et al., 2019).\nThe cross-correlation of these samples allows to trace the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in most of the investigated wells and supports the correlation of the lower Pannonian units in the investigated well as shown in Figs. 3\u20136.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFrom depth domain to time domain\n\nHarzhauser et al. (2004) correlated the letter zones of Papp (1951) with several wells of the Vienna Basin (including well Eichhorn 1) and established a subdivision based on well log patterns (Fig. 9\n). Lirer et al. (2009) performed an astronomical tuning of the Badenian, Sarmatian and Pannonian successions of the Eichhorn 1 well (Fig. 9). The tuning of Lirer et al. (2009) derived an age of 11.42\u00a0Ma for the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in well Eichhorn 1. This is seemingly in contradiction to the 11.6 ma age of this boundary proposed by Vasiliev et al. (2010), ter Borgh et al. (2013) and Magyar (2021). Unit A, which represents the lowermost Pannonian deposits in the VB, comprises coarse siliciclastics in channel fills. Therefore, sedimentation across the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary was obviously not continuous in the VB. In consequence, the age derived by Lirer et al. (2009) would fit assuming a hiatus of about 200 kyr at the position of well Eichhorn 1. This assumption fits to the fact that the shale line unit B attains only 110\u00a0m in Eichhorn 1 but is more than 250\u00a0m thicker in the wells of the southern VB, which would easily allow to \u201caccommodate\u201d the missing 200 kyr. Nevertheless, a clear caveat of the solution by Lirer et al. (2009) is the lack of magnetostratigraphic tie-points.\nHerein we correlated the letter units of Harzhauser et al. (2004) with the model of Lirer et al. (2009) (Fig. 9) to derive calculations of sedimentation rates based on the thickness of each unit in each well (Table 1). Applying the model of Lirer et al. (2009) results in following durations: B\u00a0=\u00a0120 kyr, C1\u00a0=\u00a0160 kyr, C2\u00a0=\u00a090 kyr, C3\u2013C5\u00a0=\u00a0190 kyr, C6\u2013D1\u00a0=\u00a0220 kyr, D2\u00a0=\u00a070 kyr, E1\u2013E2\u00a0=\u00a0130 kyr, E3\u2013E4\u00a0=\u00a0140 kyr, F1\u2013F2\u00a0=\u00a0150 kyr, F3\u00a0=\u00a0100 kyr. For unit G we cannot deduce such relation because we do not know the time hidden in the gap within this unit as discussed by Harzhauser et al. (2004).\nPaleomagnetic data for the Pannonian of the VB are available only for well Spannberg 21, situated at the Spannberg Ridge in the central VB (Paulissen et al., 2011). The data have been acquired onsite during downhole magnetostratigraphic measurements. Paulissen et al. (2011) identified the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in well Spannberg 21\u00a0at 866\u00a0m based on biostratigraphic data, which is confirmed herein. Paulissen et al. (2011) provided a magnetostratigraphy of the well and correlated the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary with 11.6\u00a0Ma. This age of the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary is in perfect agreement with data by Vasiliev et al. (2010) and ter Borgh et al. (2013) and was also listed by Magyar (2021) in his synthesis on the Pannonian stage and by Borzi et al. (2022) in their discussion on the Paleo-Danube delta. The herein presented cross-correlations, however, question the magnetostratigraphic data of Paulissen et al. (2011).\nThe basal Pannonian unit B is represented in well Spannberg 21 by an about 50-m-thick sequence. Our cross-correlation suggests that this succession corresponds to the uppermost part of unit B, which is overlain by the Paleo-Danube lobes of unit C1. Consequently, the equivalent of the about 250-m-thick lower part of units B and A, as documented herein from the southern wells, is entirely missing in Spannberg 21. Thus, well Spannberg 21 is an unlikely candidate to cover a continuous Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary. Using the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) would also result in unrealistically low sedimentation rates, which range around 0.3\u00a0m\/kyr for units C1, C2, E1\u2013E2, around 0.2 for unit E3-E4 and would even drop below 0.2 for unit D2 (asterisk in Fig. 10\n).\nAnother problem of the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) is the age of about 9.0\u00a0Ma for the uppermost parts of the Pannonian strata in Spannberg 21 (unit F3). At that time, the northern shelf-margin of Lake Pannon was already established in the southern Danube Basin (Magyar et al., 2013), whereas the VB was isolated from Lake Pannon (Harzhauser et al., 2004). In consequence, a difference of 1.1\u00a0Ma appears for the uppermost beds in Spannberg 21 when the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) is compared to the proposed age of units F2\/F3 derived from the model of Lirer et al. (2009). Furthermore, the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) would require correlating the deposits of unit F with the Turolian Mammal Zone 10, but the unit F mammal faunas of G\u00f6tzendorf and Stixneusiedl belong to the Vallesian Mammal Zone 9 (Daxner-H\u00f6ck and H\u00f6ck, 2015). In consequence, we doubt that the magnetostratigraphy of the Spannberg 21 well can be reliably correlated with the astronomically tuned polarity time scale. We emphasize, however, that Paulissen et al. (2011) did not have information from other wells and could not correlate Spannberg 21 with other records as done herein.\n\n\n5.2\nSediment thickness: influence of paleo-topography\nThe variability of thickness of the individual units, expressed as standard deviation from the mean, ranges around 12\u00a0m for units C2 to G2 but is much higher for units B (97\u00a0m) and C1 (43\u00a0m) (Fig. 11\n). This striking variation in thickness of unit B suggests that it fills a paleo-relief of about 300\u00a0m, which was successively flooded during the initial phase of Lake Pannon. This interpretation is in agreement with the absence of unit A in many northern wells (Fig. 7B). The shallow northern VB provided only little accommodation aside from the Paltendorf region, where subsidence along the Steinberg Fault generated a slightly deeper zone (Fig. 7B). Similarly, the region around the Spannberg Ridge was relatively shallow. The transition into the deeper basin started in the Aderklaa region and culminated in the Schwechat Depression.\nWith the termination of unit B, the topography was partly sealed as seen in seismic data, and remaining differences were subsequently balanced by the sand of unit C1. Therefore, unit C1 still shows a NE\u2013SW trend of increasing thickness which, however, is less prominent than in unit B (Fig. 11). In the northern and central VB, unit C1 comprises delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube, which were described and illustrated by Borzi et al. (2022). The subdivision of unit C1 reflects the succession of delta lobe generations overlaying each other (see Borzi et al., 2022; Fig. 4). In the southern wells, unit C1 contains deltaic bodies of yet undefined rivers. A candidate might have been the Paleo-Triesting, which entered the southern VB during the Pannonian (Harzhauser et al., 2004); Wessely (2006). In wells Rabensburg 10, unit C1 directly overlies Sarmatian strata (Fig. 3), pointing to a topographic high in the Rabensburg area. At that time, the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst might have formed a small island in Lake Pannon. Such relief is also seen in the Paltendorf field, where unit B is missing in Ringelsdorf 2 but shows an onlap close to Paltendorf T1 (Fig. 7B). The rather uniform thickness of unit C2 suggests that the former topography was now largely sealed and that differences in local subsidence were moderate (Fig. 11). Consequently, in all overlaying units, differences in sediment thickness can be interpreted as differences in regional subsidence rates because changes in the lake level would be reflected by a uniform signal. This interpretation is supported by seismic surveys, which show a rather homogenous, continuous stack of reflectors in the investigation area, with only minor erosional features and comparatively rare clinoforms above C2 (Figs. 7 and 8).\nUnits C3 to D1 display also a rather uniform distribution (Fig. 8). A slight difference is only visible along the Eichhorn-Rabensburg High with slightly lower subsidence rates during the deposition of units C6\u2013D1. For units D2 to E4, however, a distinct change in subsidence regime is evident. Now highest subsidence rates occurred in the northern VB in the Bernhardsthal, Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields, whereas sedimentation rates were decreasing in the south (Fig. 10). This trend continued during the formation of units F1 to F3. The overall increase in sedimentation rates was also detected by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) as \u201cmiddle Pannonian pulse\u201d (Fig. 12\n) and explained the coeval subsidence phase in the adjacent Pannonian basins complex.\nThus, the data suggest a northward shift of the depocenter during deposition of the middle Pannonian part of the Bzenec and Cary formations. This successive increase in sedimentation rate, however, does not explain the thick upper Pannonian Gbely Formation in the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields. Based on the assumption that the entire region was leveled after unit C1, a displacement by faulting of the Bzenec and Cary formations of about 350\u00a0m occurred between the Rabensburg 11 and the Paltendorf wells relative to the adjacent Rabensburg and Pirawarth fields. The timing of this displacement postdates the formation of G3.\nOur model reveals sedimentation rates of 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0m\/kyr for the delta lobes of unit C1 (Fig. 12). Subsequently the sedimentation rate decreased continuously down to 0.5\u00a0m\/kyr from 11.1\u00a0Ma to 10.6\u00a0Ma. The sedimentation rate increased afterwards to about 0.7\u00a0m from 10.5 to 10.3\u00a0Ma. For units E1\u2013E2, this model is in perfect agreement with the sedimentation rates derived by Kern et al. (2012, 2013) for the Hennersdorf core, based on spectral analyses of high resolution data on ostracods and magnetic susceptibility. Subsequently, the sedimentation rate decreased again down to values around 0.5\u20130.6\u00a0m\/kyr until 10.1\u00a0Ma (Fig. 12).\n\n\n5.3\nLake level versus sediment input rates versus subsidence\nIt is tempting to correlate the observed shifts in sedimentation rates with lake level changes and climatic trends. The early Pannonian was characterized a low lake level (Magyar et al., 1999a) and arid conditions (Harzhauser et al., 2007). During the middle Pannonian the lake level was distinctly rising, peaking in its maximum extent during Pannonian Zone E (Magyar et al., 1999a; Neubauer et al., 2016). This ecological trend is reflected by the morphological evolution of certain mollusc lineages (Neubauer et al., 2013) and in the stable isotope record of mollusc shells (Harzhauser et al., 2007). The lake level rise coincided with a strong increase in precipitation in central Europe, which resulted in strongly raised runoff (B\u00f6hme et al., 2008, 2011). Therefore, the low sedimentation rates in the lower Pannonian units C2\u2013C7 would correlate with the arid phase, whereas the middle Pannonian rise of sedimentation rates would coincide with increased runoff and a rising lake level.\nThis interpretation, however, is in conflict with the few available numerical data on lake level changes.\n\nBorzi et al. (2022) performed in-seismic measurements of the clinoforms of the Paleo-Danube delta lobes using true vertical-depth seismic data. These data reveal a minimum lake level of 180\u00a0m during the initial phase of the formation of unit C1 and a subsequent decrease of lake water depth down to about 100\u00a0m towards the top of C1. This declining water depth caused switches of drainage direction of some of the delta lobes (Borzi et al., 2022) but the declining accommodation is not reflected in the well logs. A major lake level rise of Lake Pannon (mfs 3 between units C2 and C3) caused the flooding of the margins of the VB, resulting in back stepping of fluvial deposits into the North Alpine Foreland Basin, which led to the termination of delta deposition in the VB (Harzhauser et al., 2003; Harzhauser, 2009; Borzi et al., 2022). This event, however, is not reflected by increased sedimentation rates. Thus, we assume that subsidence is the main factor explaining the lateral and temporal shifts in sediment accumulation. Lake level changes, however, are reflected by the observed successions of minor flooding surfaces serrating the funnel-shaped well logs. Thus, the general subsidence signal is modulated by lake level oscillations.\n\n\n5.4\nDo the records provide indications for compression during the Pannonian?\n\nPeresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) proposed an onset of a compressional tectonic regime in the VB during the late Pannonian, which was adopted in many subsequent schemes depicting the tectonic history of the VB (e.g., Strauss et al., 2006; Lee and Wagreich, 2016, 2017). Their interpretation was based on deformed upper Pannonian strata in the Cary Formation from the Steinfeld outcrop in the southern Vienna Basin (Peresson and Decker, 1997a, 1997b) (corresponding to units F1\u2013F3). This structure, however, was reinterpreted as synsedimentary slump by Exner et al. (2008) and Grundtner et al. (2009). Therefore, the main geological argument for the existence of a compressional regime in the VB during that phase of the late Pannonian was invalidated. The Gbely Formation is the uppermost unit of the Pannonian sediment stack in the VB (comprising the herein studied units G1\u2013G3 and unit H, which is not covered by our data). A late Pannonian age of the Gbely Fm was established based on the mammal fauna, which allows a correlation with the Turolian mammal zones MN 10\/11 (Daxner-H\u00f6ck and H\u00f6ck, 2015), representing a time span of about 9.6 to 8.0\u00a0Ma (Harzhauser et al., 2004). Herein, only 169\u00a0m of this formation were drilled in the Paltendorf area but the formation, which seems to be subdivided by two gaps, attains up to 450\u00a0m in thickness (Harzhauser et al., 2004). This documents considerable subsidence in the northern VB during the late Pannonian until about 8\u00a0Ma. The seismic survey does not reveal any signs of a compressional regime in the upper Pannonian deposits and the fault systems suggest an extensional mechanism (Fig. 7). Especially, the tectonic displacement of units G1\u2013G3 between the Paltendorf region and the adjacent high zones of the Bernhardsthal and Pirawarth areas occurred along a fault after the deposition of the Gbely Formation (see Fig. 7A). This points to ongoing extensional tectonics even after the deposition of the Gbely Formation and is a further argument against a compressional regime during this phase of the Pannonian. Thus, basin inversion occurred at a later stage of basin development. In the adjacent Danube Basin, \u0160ujan et al. (2021) documented the onset of basin inversion around 6\u00a0Ma, which would fit to our data and would be in the stratigraphic range proposed by Peresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) for the VB.\nThe Gbely Formation (units G1\u2013G3) is preserved only in small graben structures but is missing on the adjacent highs. Thus, the lack of the Gbely Formation in most wells and large parts of the VB documents a post-Pannonian erosion of Upper Miocene strata of about 400\u00a0m. This value increases to more than 500\u00a0m in areas where also the Cary Formation is missing. This erosion is evidence for the basin inversion discussed by Peresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) and based on our data, the onset of this basin inversion occurred distinctly after 8\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nFor the first time, the Pannonian of the Austrian part of the Vienna Basin is correlated along a distance of about 100\u00a0km spanning from the hydrocarbon fields in the Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg areas in the NE to the Schwechat Depression in the SE. The investigated well logs display characteristic, laterally repetitive patterns, which allow the separation of distinct sedimentary units, which can be followed along large distances. The basal Pannonian unit displays considerably variability in thickness with a clear NE-SW trend from low to high thickness. This pattern captures the paleo-topography of the VB after the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary, when basinal marls rapidly filled the deeper parts of the basin. At that time, subsidence was high in the Schwechat Depression but negligible in the northern VB, where the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst formed a small island. Thus, the early Pannonian tectonic regime was similar to that of the Sarmatian, when tectonic subsidence was also higher in the southern VB than in the northern VB (H\u00f6lzel et al., 2008).\nRemnants of the paleo-relief were subsequently filled by the sand of the delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube in the northern and central VB and by other rivers in the Schwechat region. A lake level rise terminated these deltaic developments and a major flooding surface leveled the investigation area. The overlying units C3 to D1 are relatively uniformly developed in the entire investigation area, indicating no marked differences in subsidence in the various hydrocarbon fields. The sedimentation rate was decreasing during this phase from 0.8 to 1.0\u00a0m\/kyr down to around 0.5\u00a0m\/kyr (Fig. 12). We consider the latter value to be an estimate of real subsidence, whereas the initial sedimentation rate is rather a matter of the rapidly filled accommodation space of the paleo-relief. Subsequently, sedimentation rates were increasing on average to about 0.7\u20130.8\u00a0m\/kyr during the middle Pannonian, which agrees with estimates of Kern et al. (2012, 2013), derived by independent methods. This \u201cmiddle Pannonian pulse\u201d has also been observed by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and was related to the coeval major basin-forming subsidence phase in the adjacent Pannonian basins complex. This pulse, however, was not uniform but was accelerated in the northern part of the VB down to the Spannberg Ridge, whereas subsidence remained constant or decreased in the central and southern VB. The middle Pannonian pulse of subsidence was thus especially related to the Steinberg Fault.\nThis reveals a threefold Pannonian subsidence history of the Vienna Basin:\n\n\u2022\n10.4\u201311.0\u00a0Ma: high subsidence in the southern VB and low subsidence in the northern VB\n\n\n\u2022\n11.0\u201310.6\u00a0Ma: uniform subsidence rates throughout investigation area\n\n\n\u2022\n10.6\u201310.2\u00a0Ma: low subsidence in southern VB and high subsidence in the northern VB\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence for a decrease of subsidence during the late Pannonian and the faults, displacing the upper Pannonian strata between the Paltendorf region and the adjacent high zones of the Bernhardsthal and Pirawarth areas by about 350\u00a0m, suggest persisting extensional tectonics rather than compressional tectonics. Thus, basin inversion occurred after 8\u00a0Ma and is reflected by considerably erosion of at least 400\u00a0m of uppermost Pannonian deposits. Therefore, a Pannonian compressional regime of the VB is not supported by our data.\n\n","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDeep fluid flow in sedimentary basins has a profound influence on many diagenetic processes (for example, dissolution, cementation, and dolomitization), and reservoir properties (Morad et al., 2000; Packard et al., 2001; Boles et al., 2004; Ehrenberg et al., 2006; Moradpour et al., 2008; Howarth and Alves, 2016; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020; Stacey et al., 2021a, b). Fractures can be very important in limestones because they can have a major positive effect on permeability (Nelson, 2001; Dewever et al., 2007). Numerous previous studies have described that faults and fractures can act as pathways for early karst (e.g., Choquette and James, 1988; Guidry et al., 2007; Budd et al., 2013). Recently, considerable work has been done on the fault- and fracture-related diagenetic alteration, especially fault-related dolomitization (e.g., Davies and Smith, 2006; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020; Stacey et al., 2021a, b) and burial (hypogenic) karst (e.g., Klimchouk, 2012, 2017; Bertotti et al., 2020). For instance, Cazarin et al. (2019) suggested that large subvertical faults and fractures favor efficient upward movement of aggressive fluids without considerable heat loss. Similarly, Bertotti et al. (2020) proposed that deep strike-slip faults served as pathways for upward fluid flow forming hypogenic caves. These studies created more attention on tectonically-driven fluid flow, which may be of considerable importance for adequately understanding diagenetic processes and predicting reservoir distribution. However, constraining fluid flow in terms of fluid origin, timing and circulation mechanisms in deep burial basins can be difficult due to the complex tectonic activity, such as faults becoming activated and reactivated.\nRecent hydrocarbon exploration in the Tarim basin has revealed that ultra-deep (>6000\u00a0m) reservoirs are pervasively developed at temperatures exceeding 160\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g., Zhu et al., 2018, 2019; Yang et al., 2020a, b). For example, the recently drilled Luntan-1 exploration well produced high-quality oil from Lower Cambrian carbonate at a depth of 8200\u00a0m. To date, this is the deepest oil discovery in China and among the deepest in the world (Yang et al., 2020a). The recent hydrocarbon exploration success in the southern Halahatang oilfield has shown that the strike-slip faults play an important role in reservoir distribution and hydrocarbon accumulation. Highly productive wells are predominantly found adjacent to the strike-slip faults, with oil production increasing with proximity to faults (Sun et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020b). Consequently, substantial work has been carried out on the structural characterization of strike-slip faults (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2019). Previous works have indicated that large cavities, which constitute the main reservoir porosity, formed by epigenetic karst, and\/or fault-related karst (Sun et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). However, more recent studies have proposed that deep-burial dissolution processes might be responsible for hydrocarbon-hosting cavities (Fu, 2019; Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2020; Ukar et al., 2020). Thus, the mechanism for reservoir formation is still controversial in the study area. A better understanding of the origin and evolution of tectonic-fluids is therefore of significance for the origin of deeply buried karst carbonate reservoirs.\nThis study aims to reconstruct the tectonic-fluid flow history and identify the mechanisms for reservoir formation. To achieve these goals, we have studied the petrographic characteristics of the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements from core samples, together with the analysis of in situ carbon and oxygen isotopes (using SIMS), trace elements, rare earth element and yttrium, clumped isotopes and strontium isotopes. These techniques were used to constrain the origin of each of the tectonic-fluid flow. In particular, the study aims to identify: (\u2160) the origin and evolution of tectonic-driven fluids during the basin history; (\u2161) timing of the fluid flow through petrographical and geochemical evidence and circulation mechanisms within the context of regional tectonics; and (\u2162) with new data to address previous hypotheses for the origin of carbonate dissolution and key factors controlling the distribution of reservoirs in deeply buried basins.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Tarim Basin, located in southern Xinjiang province, northwestern China, is surrounded by the Tianshan Mountains in the north, the Kunlun Mountains in the south, and the Altyn Tagh Mountains in the southeast (Fig. 1\nA). Based on primary basement faults and basement structure, the Tarim Basin can be divided into ten tectonic units, comprising six depressions and four uplifts (Jia, 1997). The southern Halahatang Oilfield, investigated in this study, is located in the southern part of Tabei Uplift, between the Awati depression and the Manjiaer depression (Fig. 1A). It consists of the Jinyue, Yueman, Fuyuan, Guole, and other blocks. Our sample wells were collected mainly from the Jinyue, Yueman, and Fuyuan blocks (Fig. 1B).\n\n2.1\nStratigraphic framework\nThe stratigraphy of the Halahatang Oilfield is presented in Fig. 2\n. It comprises a series of Precambrian (Sinian) to Devonian marine strata, Carboniferous to Permian marine-terrigenous strata, and Triassic to Quaternary terrestrial deposits (Li et al., 1996). The reservoir is hosted by an Ordovician marine sedimentary succession. From base to top, the Ordovician succession consists of the Penglaiba (O1\np), Yingshan (O1-2\ny), Yijianfang (O2\nyj), Tumuxiuke (O3\nt), Lianglitag (O3\nl), and Sangtamu (O3\ns) formations (Zhang et al., 2013). Specially, the Yijianfang and Yingshan formations are the predominant hydrocarbon-producing units, mainly consisting of mudstone, grainstone, and bioclastic wackstone (Zhang et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016) (Fig. 2). The Yijianfang and Yingshan Formations form the focus of this study and were deposited in an open platform with the development of local intra-platform shoals (Sun et al., 2016). Previous work has indicated that most of the hydrocarbons in the Ordovician reservoirs were generated from the underlying Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation source rock (Lu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2020b). Three episodes of hydrocarbon charging have been identified in the study region, which occurred in Silurian, Permian, and Paleogene, respectively (Yang et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2020) (Fig. 2). Specifically, the Permian Hercynian orogeny was the main period of hydrocarbon charging.\n\n\n2.2\nRegional structural geology\nThe Tarim Basin experienced a complicated multiphase tectonic evolution (Jia, 1997). During the dismantling of the supercontinent Rodinia, the basement of the Tarim Basin was separated (Ren, 1996). In the early Paleozoic, the north Tarim Block was under an extensional regime, and the South Tianshan Ocean was formed. The south Tarim Block was characterized by a paleo-Tethys trench-arc-basin system (Mattern and Schneider, 2000; Li et al., 2013). The Manjiaer Depression was formed in the east of the Tarim Block during this extensional regime (Gao et al., 2009). The extensional setting lasted until the Middle Ordovician when subduction began, and the Kudi Ocean in the southwest started to close (Li et al., 2013). The tectonic setting of the Tarim Basin evolved from extension to compression. Increasing orogenic activity in the newly formed active margins in the southwest caused the formation of the Tazhong and the Tabei uplifts. In the studied Halahatang region, an \u201cX-shaped\u201d fault array consisting of both northeast-trending (NE) and northwest-trending (NW) strike-slip faults (F1) was formed in compressional regime (Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b) (Fig. 1B). The compressive regime in the south proceeded until the Middle Devonian. During the Late Devonian to the Permian, an active continental margin developed on the northern margin of the Tarim Basin, where the South Tianshan Ocean was subducted toward the north (Chen et al., 1999). The northeast trending (NE) strike-slip faults (F2) were formed in an extensional regime (Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). In the Triassic, the Tianshan Orogenic Belt continued to uplift due to the collision between the Eurasian Plate and the northern margin of the Tarim Block, leading to an intense uplift and erosion in the Tarim Block. From the Jurassic to Cretaceous, the Tarim Basin was characterized by a weak intracontinental extensional tectonic setting. From the Paleogene, the Tarim Basin has been generally influenced by far-field compression due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates (Sobel and Dumitru, 1997).\nIn seismic data, faulting can be classified into three types (Fig. 3\n), in chronological order: (\u2170) Cambrian-Ordovician transpressional faults, which are characterized by positive flower structures; (\u2171) Silurian-Permian transtensional faults displaying negative flower structures; and (\u2172) Triassic-Paleogene en echelon normal faults, with minor displacement (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nPetrographic analysis\nThis study is based on a detailed petrographic examination of 20 wells from the southern Halahatang Oilfield. A total of 175 thin sections were analyzed using transmitted light and cathodoluminescence microscopy (CL). The CL apparatus used in the study was a Reliotron Relion III model, with a beam voltage of 8\u00a0kV and a current of 300\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcA. Thin section fluorescence was observed under ultraviolet (UV) light via a Zeiss Axioscope A1 A Pol microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (100\u00a0W).\n\n\n3.2\nGeochemical analysis\nIn situ \u03b413C and \u03b418O measurements were performed by SIMS using a Cameca IMS-1280 ion microprobe at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS), Beijing, China. The analytical procedures were described by Rollion-Bard et al. (2003). Instrumental conditions were similar to Liu et al. (2017). Briefly, the analysis spot diameter was 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm. The internal precision for each spot ranges from 0.009 to 0.015 (% Standard Error). The measurement accuracy was less than 0.6\u2030 for carbon and 0.4\u2030 for oxygen with UWC (international calcite standard from University of Wisconsin) and OKA (Chinese primary calcite standard No. GBW04481) as standards. All in situ SIMS results refer to VPDB.\nTrace element (Fe, Mn, and Sr) geochemistry was carried out by electron microprobe analysis (JEOL JXA 8100) at IGGCAS. Quantitative analyses were analyzed using wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS). The microprobe was operated using an acceleration voltage of 15\u00a0kV, a beam current of 10\u00a0nA, and a beam size of 10 \u03bcm. Natural minerals and oxides were used as calibration standards. The peak counting time was 20\u00a0s for all elements, and the background counting time was 10\u00a0s on the high- and low-energy background positions. The detection limits were 145\u00a0ppm for Fe, 100\u00a0ppm for Mn, and 90\u00a0ppm for Sr.\nIn situ analysis of rare earth elements (with yttrium) were determined by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) employing an Element XR HR-ICP-MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at IGGCAS. The approach is similar to that described in Wu et al. (2018), with isotopes measured using a peak-hopping mode. The laser diameter was 35 \u03bcm, and the repetition rate was 8\u00a0Hz. NIST SRM 610 reference glass was used for external calibration, and ARM-1 (Wu et al., 2019) and BCR glass were used for quality control monitoring. The resulting data were reduced based on the GLITTER software (Griffin, 2008). For most trace elements (>0.005\u00a0g\/g), the accuracy is better than \u00b110%, and the analytical precision (1 RSD) is approximately \u00b110%. All measured rare earth element\u00a0+\u00a0yttrium (REY) contents were normalized to the standard Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS; Mclennan, 1989). Normalized Ce, Eu and Pr anomalies were calculated as follows: Ce\/Ce*\u00a0=\u00a0[Ce\/(0.5La+0.5Pr)]SN (Bau and Dulski, 1996), Eu\/Eu*\u00a0=\u00a0EuSN\/(SmSN\n2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0TbSN)1\/3 (Lawrence et al., 2006), and Pr\/Pr*\u00a0=\u00a0[Pr\/(0.5Ce\u00a0+\u00a00.5Nd)]SN (Bau and Dulski, 1996).\nThe measurement of clumped isotope (\u039447) on vug-filling (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and fracture-filling calcite cements (n\u00a0=\u00a023) was carried out at the Laboratory for Environmental Isotope Geochemistry, IGGCAS, using a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For each analysis, 10\u201312\u00a0mg of sample was weighed for clumped isotope analyses using a fully-automated sample preparation system, the Imperial Batch Extraction (IBEX). The CO2 extraction procedures were described by Qi et al. (2020). The detailed instrumentation and measurement procedures followed the description of Wang et al. (2016). Raw isotope data were processed following the procedure provided by Huntington et al. (2009). Non-linearity correction of the raw \u039447 values and data calibration were performed using solid carbonate standards ETH1\u223cETH4 and the InerCarb method were used (Bernasconi et al., 2021). The adopted \u039447, CDES 25\u00b0C values for ETH were given by Bernasconi et al. (2021). The \u039447 value was adjusted using acid fractionation factor for the reaction of the sample at a temperature of 90\u00a0\u00b0C, an acid fractionation factor of 0.088 was used for calcite (Petersen et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022). Two laboratory standards, namely the NB4 (marble) and P1 (coral) were used to monitor and correct for any drift during sample preparation and measurement using IBEX. The \u039447, CDES 25\u00b0C values (\u00b11 SE) of the NB4 and P1 measured using IBEX were 0.476 (\u00b10.002) \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a060) and 0.702 (\u00b10.002) \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a035), respectively. The results were converted to the \u039447 values against the absolute reference frame (i.e., CDES) presented by Dennis et al. (2011). Temperatures were calculated following the equation proposed by Swart et al. (2019) for samples reacted at 90\u00a0\u00b0C without applying an acid fractionation factor. The \u03b413C and \u03b418O values were measured and reported in delta notation relative to VPDB scale as determined using a pre-calibrated CO2 tank gas (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u221218.14\u2030 VPDB and \u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u221229.73\u2030 VPDB) as a reference gas. The oxygen isotopic compositions of diagenetic fluids (\u03b418Ow) were calculated following the Kim and O'Neil (1997) equation, and the results were reported relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, \u2030).\nThe Sr isotope analyses were carried out using a VG354 solid source mass spectrometer at the Rb\u2013Sr Isotope Ultra-clean Laboratory at the IGGCAS. A total of 21 samples were collected by micro-drill. Measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios were corrected for mass fractionation using 87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.1194. During the course of this measurement, the standard NBS987 yielded a mean 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.710272\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000012.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography\nTwo major sets of fractures are present in the studied cores based on their orientation, their dip with respect to bedding, and their chronological timing of emplacement indicated by cross-cutting relationships (F1 and F2, respectively). Based on core observations and thin-section analysis, F1 and F2 fractures show variable fracture infillings. The characteristics and sequence of vug- and fracture-filling cements can be summarized as follows:\n\n4.1.1\nF1 fracture-filling cement\nThe NE- and NW- trending fractures (F1) are usually characterized by sub-horizontal or oblique orientations (Fig. 4\nA, C). They are commonly filled by debris and cemented by sparry geopetal calcite cements (Fig. 4A\u2013D). In some cases, they were filled with greenish clay. Some of filled fractures are crosscut by stylolites (Fig. 4C). F1 fractures have widths of up to 2\u00a0cm and lengths of 15\u00a0dm. Pyrite occurs in F1 fractures in some core intervals (Fig. 4A\u2013D). Two main stages of calcite cements were identified in F1 fractures (named F1-1 and F1-2; Fig. 5\nE) based on petrographic and cathodoluminescence (CL) characteristics. Under plane-polarized light, F1-1 calcite cements (<1.6\u00a0cm wide) exhibit fibrous textures and are non-luminescent under CL (Fig. 5A and B). The second stage of calcite cements (F1-2; <1\u00a0cm wide) in fractures have blocky textures and exhibit a dark red luminescence (Fig. 5C and D).\n\n\n4.1.2\nF2 fracture-filling cement\nThe second set of NE trending fractures (F2) (often <3\u00a0mm wide) crosscutting F1 fractures (Fig. 5A and B, 6\nC) and vugs (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, 6B) are generally sub-vertical, and commonly contain dissolution features (Fig. 4E\u2013H). In addition, bitumen occurs pervasively in F2 fractures (Fig. 4E\u2013H) and fluoresces under UV-light (Fig. 7\nA and B). The F2 fractures are mainly cemented by calcite. In some cases, quartz occurs as a cement following calcite (Fig. 6E and F). Abundant pressure solution features such as sub-horizontal stylolites are present in all core intervals (Fig. 7C\u2013F). Sub-horizontal stylolites are crosscut by sub-vertical F2 fractures (Fig. 7C). Based on the cement morphology and CL characteristics, the F2 fractures are filled by F2-1 and F2-2 calcite cements, showing dull, bright orange to red CL, respectively (Fig. 8\nA and B). In some cases, the fractures are lined or filled only by F2-1 cements (Fig. 8D and E).\n\n\n4.1.3\nVug-filling cements\nThe matrix carbonates in the Middle Ordovician of the Halahatang Oilfield are generally non-porous. Vugs are usually largely filled by green clay and blocky calcite cement (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, H, 6A, B, 9\n). Silica and barite (Fig. 6G and H) are locally observed. Overall, there are two stages of vug-filling calcite cements that were distinguished based on their CL characteristics. The first generation of vug-filling calcite cement (V1) that can reach 6\u00a0cm in size exhibits a zoned dull and bright orange CL pattern and is the most volumetrically significant phases. The second generation of vug-filling blocky calcite cement (V2) exhibits dull-to-brown luminescence (Fig. 9B, E), reaching 2\u00a0cm in size. It is noteworthy that sometimes vugs are found in connection with F1 fractures, and they show similar petrographic infillings (Fig. 6A). The detail paragenetic sequence is summarized in Fig. 10\n.\n\n\n4.1.4\nDissolution in matrix and cements\nIn the matrix, minor dissolution pores are present in the studied wells. Some dissolution pores are observed along stylolites. Most vugs are occluded by green clay, and the above described two stages of calcite cements (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, H, 6A, B, 9). Pervasive dissolution occurs in fracture F1-2 (Figs. 5F and 6C), fracture F2-1, and F2-2 (Fig. 4E\u2013H, 6D, 8). Overall, dissolution in the matrix is rarely observed. The predominant dissolution occurs along fractures.\n\n\n\n4.2\nCarbon and oxygen isotope data\nSIMS in situ carbon and oxygen isotopic measurements on vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are given in Figs. 8, 9 and 11\n and listed in Table 1\n. The V1 cements have \u03b418O values varing in the range of \u22125.48 to \u22120.90\u2030 VPDB (mean: \u22122.72\u2030). The \u03b413C values in V1 cements range from \u22121.09 to 2.34\u2030 VPDB (mean: 0.60\u2030). The V2 cements have a broad range of relatively negative \u03b418O values (\u221210.89 to \u22126.02\u2030), with \u03b413C values ranging from \u22122.07 to 0.6\u2030.\nThe F1-1 cements show well clustered \u03b418O and \u03b413C values (\u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.24 to \u22124.64\u2030; \u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u20131.2\u2030). Compared with F1-1 cements, the F1-2 cements have relatively negative \u03b418O values and similar \u03b413C values (\u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128.43 to \u22124.98\u2030; \u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.3 to 0.8\u2030). The F2-1 cements show more negative \u03b418O values (mean: \u22129.46\u2030) and \u03b413C values (mean: \u22120.72\u2030) compared to F1-2 cements. While the F2-2 cements have very negative \u03b418O (\u221218.39 to \u221210.73\u2030), with \u03b413C values ranging from \u22123.75 to 0.57\u2030 (Fig. 11).\n\n\n4.3\nTrace elements\nTrace-element concentrations of the different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 12\n.\n\n4.3.1\nIron\nThe V1, V2, and F1-1 cements have low iron (Fe) values, with mean concentrations less than 440\u00a0ppm (Fig. 12A). F1-2 cements display slightly higher Fe contents. In contrast, the F2-1 cements have significantly higher Fe contents (as much as 4330\u00a0ppm). In contrast, the F2-2 cements are characterized by low Fe contents (less than 365\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n4.3.2\nManganese\nCompared with the V1 cements, the V2 cements display relatively high manganese (Mn) concentrations (as much as 697\u00a0ppm; Fig. 12A). The mean of Mn concentrations of F1-2 cements is significantly higher than that of F1-1 cements, 431\u00a0ppm, and 174\u00a0ppm, respectively. The Mn concentrations in F2-1 cements vary from 108 to 403\u00a0ppm. In contrast, the F2-2 cements display a slight enrichment of Mn concentrations (up to 527\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n4.3.3\nStrontium\nThe V1 cements exhibit relatively high Sr concentrations (up to 660\u00a0ppm; Fig. 12B), whereas V2 cements have relatively low Sr concentrations, ranging between 152\u00a0ppm and 465\u00a0ppm. The F1-1 cements show high Sr concentrations (up to 728\u00a0ppm) compared to F1-2 cements (mean: 261\u00a0ppm). The F2-1 cements show elevated Sr contents (up to 685\u00a0ppm). In contrast, the F2-2 cements are characterized by low Sr contents (mean: 193\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n\n4.4\nRare earth elements and yttrium\nThe distribution of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in the matrix and different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite are presented in Table 2\n and Fig. 13\n and described below.\n\n4.4.1\nMatrix\nThe mean total content of REY (\u2211REY) for the matrix is 37.0\u00a0ppm. The mean of \u2211LREE (28.2\u00a0ppm) displays an enrichment compared to the \u2211HREE (8.9\u00a0ppm). The REY profiles within the matrix have a positive La and negative Ce anomaly (Fig. 13C). The mean ratio between Y\/Ho is 32 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.2\nFracture-filling calcite cement F1-1\nThe mean \u2211REY for F1-1 cements is 17.8\u00a0ppm. The REY profiles within the F1-1 calcite cements have a positive La and more obvious negative Ce anomaly, and enrichment in HREE (Fig. 13A). All Samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Pr anomaly versus Ce anomalies plot, confirming that these are true Ce anomalies present (Bau and Dulski, 1996; Webb and Kamber, 2000). The mean ratio of Y\/Ho is 42.2 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.3\nFracture-filling calcite cement F1-2\nThe F1-2 calcite cements REY profiles display a low mean of \u2211REY (5.3\u00a0ppm), showing Ce positive anomalies (Fig. 13A). The REY within the F2-1 calcite cements are slightly enriched in MREE. The mean ratio of Y\/Ho is 48.7 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.4\nFracture-filling calcite cement F2-1\nThe F2-1 calcite cements REY profiles display a relatively low mean of \u2211REY (7.9\u00a0ppm). Strong positive Eu anomalies ranging from 0.9 to 4.3 are clearly illustrated in PAAS normalized REY profiles (Fig. 13B). The Y\/Ho ranges between 41.0 and 80.5.\n\n\n4.4.5\nFracture-filling calcite cement F2-2\nThe mean total content of REY for F2-2 calcite cements is higher than that in the F2-1 calcite cements (43.5\u00a0ppm). The F2-2 cements exhibit a relatively flat profile (Fig. 13B). The calculation of both Ce anomalies and Pr anomalies shows values close to 1 (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho is low (mean: 32.6).\n\n\n4.4.6\nVug-filling calcite cement (V1)\nThe V1 calcite cements REY profiles display a mean of \u2211REY (4.0\u00a0ppm) and apparent Ce and positive Y anomalies (Fig. 13C). Samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Ce\/Ce* versus Pr\/Pr* plot (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho ranges from 39 to 63 (mean 51; Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.7\nVug-filling calcite cement (V2)\nThe V2 calcite cements have mean values of \u2211LREE and \u2211LREE of 2.3\u00a0ppm and 1.6\u00a0ppm, respectively. They show weak anomalies of Ce with a slight middle REE enrichment (Fig. 13C). Most samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Ce\/Ce* versus Pr\/Pr* plot (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho are high (mean 47; Table 2).\n\n\n\n4.5\nClumped isotope thermometry and oxygen isotope of fluid\nThe clumped isotope results of the different stages of vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements are presented in Fig. 14\n and Table 3\n. The clumped isotope values of vug-filling cements range from 0.549 to 0.598\u2030. The fracture-filling cements display a wide range of \u039447 values from 0.470 to 0.611\u2030.\nThe V1 and V2 cements have average clumped isotope temperatures of 63\u00a0\u00b0C and 85\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with similar \u03b418Ow values around +4.2\u2030 VSMOW, respectively.\nThe F1-1 cements show temperatures of 55\u00a0\u00b0C\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with \u03b418Ow values of +3.0 to +6.4\u2030 VSMOW. In contrast, calculations for F1-2 cements provide relatively higher temperatures of 78\u00a0\u00b0C\u201399\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with \u03b418Ow values ranging from +4.6 to +7.1\u2030 VSMOW.\nThe F2-1 cements suggest considerably higher temperatures of 113\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013145\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with more positive \u03b418Ow values of +7.2 to +9.0\u2030 VSMOW (Fig. 14). Compared to F2-1 cements, the F2-2 cements have decreased calculated temperatures of 82\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013117\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with more negative \u03b418Ow values of \u22121.4 to +2.7\u2030 VSMOW.\n\n\n4.6\nStrontium isotopes\nThe analytical results are listed in Table 4\n and shown in Fig. 15\n. The matrix spans a wide ranging radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from 0.7086 to 0.7094 (mean: 0.7089). Both the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements have much lower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios compared to the matrix, averaging 0.7085 and 0.7087, respectively.\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation and discussion\n\n5.1\nPreservation of primary diagenetic signatures\n\n5.1.1\nAssessing recrystallization\nCarbonate recrystallization mainly occurs by dissolution-precipitation reactions driven by geochemical disequilibria between minerals and fluids (Machel, 1997). This process can lead to the alteration of diagenetic phases both petrographically (e.g., increase in crystal size and changes in mineral texture) and geochemically (e.g., carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes, and trace elements), which may result in recrystallized phases reflecting a mixture of the chemical compositions of the primary carbonates and the late precipitated phases (Machel, 1997; Ingalls, 2019). Furthermore, recrystallization may alter the \u039447 compositions of carbonates via the creation of new C\u2013O bonds (Dennis and Schrag, 2010).\nPetrographic and geochemical criteria are used for evaluating the degree of recrystallization of the investigated samples. Patchy fabrics in CL are only observed in the matrix (Fig. 5A and B, 9A, B), while the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements generally exhibit no patchy CL. In addition, clustered 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Fig. 15) for the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements indicate preservation of primary diagenetic information (Luczaj and Goldstein, 2000; Azomani et al., 2013). The matrix seems to have experienced pervasive recrystallization during burial, which is corroborated by the wide range of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Fig. 15). However, the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements exhibit little evidence for recrystallization.\n\n\n5.1.2\nModelling the effects of solid-state reordering on T(\u039447)\nPrevious studies have shown that solid-state reordering of C\u2013O bonds in buried carbonates exposed to temperatures >\u223c75\u00b0C-100\u00a0\u00b0C can alter primary \u039447 compositions over million-year timescales (Passey and Henkes, 2012; Henkes et al., 2014; Stolper and Eiler, 2015). The paired diffusion model by Stolper and Eiler (2015) is used to predict the extent of solid-state C\u2013O bond reordering during burial and exhumation as it is proved to be more suitable for deeply buried sedimentary basins (Lawson et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020).\nThe model shows that both the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements have experienced some degree of solid-state reordering (Fig. 16\n). Thus our samples have apparent T(\u039447) values that reflect solid-state reordering during burial and heating. While a fully reordering could be excluded because the apparent T(\u039447) of our samples are much lower than the blocking temperature of calcite (i.e., \u223c150\u00b0C\u2013170\u00a0\u00b0C; Henkes et al., 2014; Huntington et al., 2015), and all the analyzed samples show the apparent T(\u039447) lower than their present-day maximum burial temperature of 170\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 14). If full reordering occurs, all cements would have shown a common apparent temperature. Therefore, these models suggest that our samples experienced partial C\u2013O bond reordering without complete equilibration of clumped isotopes at present-day maximum burial temperature.\n\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin and timing of tectonic-diagenetic fluids\n\n5.2.1\nVug-filling calcite cement (V1)\nThe V1 calcite cement is the earliest diagenetic phase filling vugs (Fig. 9). The \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb values are within the expected range of Lower-Middle Ordovician marine values (\u22122 to 2\u2030, \u22126 to \u22124\u2030 PDB, respectively; Veizer et al., 1999; Henkes et al., 2018; Fig. 11). Some of the samples display 3\u2030 positive \u03b418O values compared with coeval marine carbonates, which indicates they may have precipitated from evaporated seawater. In addition, V1 calcite cements have significant negative Ce anomalies (Fig. 13C) consistent with precipitation from oxygenated seawater (Tostevin et al., 2016). Low concentrations of Fe and Mn (Table 1; Fig. 12) further support this interpretation. However, the temperatures obtained from the clumped isotopes are around 60\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 3; Fig. 14), which are higher than the surface seawater temperature expected for the Early-Middle Ordovician (approximately \u223c30\u00a0\u00b0C; Henkes et al., 2018). The relatively high \u039447-derived temperature could be caused by solid-state reordering during burial, as discussed above. If we assume that the V1 calcite cements were initially precipitated at approximately 30\u00a0\u00b0C, then gradually buried to peak burial temperature of 170\u00a0\u00b0C at present, the C\u2013O bond would undergo partial solid-state reordering, and the final T(\u039447) would be around 70\u00a0\u00b0C using the reordering model by Stolper and Eiler (2015) (Fig. 16E). Accordingly, we reconstructed the original T(\u039447) based on this model, and the restored T(\u039447) of V1 calcite cements varies between 21 and 24\u00a0\u00b0C. The partial solid-state reordering results in spuriously elevated T(\u039447) values without change in \u03b418Ocarb, leading to the calculation of higher \u03b418Ow values. Therefore, we recalculated the \u03b418Ow values (Restored \u03b418Ow values) based on the restored T(\u039447) values (Table 3). The average restored \u03b418Ow values of V1 calcite cements is \u22122.7\u2030 VSMOW, which is close to the coeval seawater (\u22122 to 0\u2030 VSMOW; Henkes et al., 2018). Overall, the integrated petrographic and geochemical evidence suggests a marine origin for V1 cement.\n\n\n5.2.2\nVug-filling calcite cement (V2)\nThe V2 calcite cements exhibit more negative \u03b418Ocarb values compared to V1 calcite cements (Fig. 11). The measured \u039447 temperatures are high (mean: 85\u00a0\u00b0C). Similarly, we implemented the model of Stolper and Eiler (2015) to reconstruct the original precipitation temperatures. An original cement growth temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C would give rise to a present-day apparent temperature of \u223c90\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 16F). According to the reordering model prediction, the V2 calcite cements formed at restored T(\u039447) values ranging from 53 to 57\u00a0\u00b0C. The restored \u03b418Ow values vary from \u22121.3 to +1.3\u2030 VSMOW (Fig. 14). This suggests that the V2 cements precipitated from modified seawater through water-rock reactions at elevated burial temperatures, which is further indicated by the enrichments in MREE and absence of Ce anomalies in V2 calcite cements (Fig. 13C). Combined with representative burial history curves for the study area (Fig. 17\n), calculated restored \u039447 temperatures of around 55\u00a0\u00b0C might indicate V2 cements precipitated at \u223c1000\u00a0m depth within the shallow burial diagenetic environment.\n\n\n5.2.3\nFracture filling calcite cement (F1-1)\nThe F1-1 cements are cut by bedding-parallel stylolites (Fig. 4C), suggesting they formed early at a shallow depth (<1\u00a0km) (Machel, 2004). The \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb values for F1-1 cements overlap with coeval marine carbonates (Fig. 11). In addition, the restored average \u039447 derived temperatures of 27\u00a0\u00b0C in F1-1 cements (Fig. 14) are consistent with the coeval seawater temperature. The restored \u03b418Ow values in F1-1 cements (mean: \u22121.7\u2030 VSMOW) are in the range of Ordovician seawater (Fig. 14). The F1-1 cements exhibit a seawater-like REY pattern with a negative Ce anomaly and a positive Y anomaly and enrichment in HREE (Fig. 13A). The pronounced negative Ce anomaly suggests oxidizing conditions (Bau and Koschinsky, 2009; Wallace et al., 2017). Samples clustering within the marine quadrant of a Pr\/Pr* versus Ce\/Ce* plot confirms that these are real Ce anomalies (i.e. not an artefact of the La anomaly) (Bau and Dulski, 1996; Webb and Kamber, 2000; Fig. 13D). Furthermore, the high Y\/Ho values (>40) (Table 2) are consistent with a marine origin. Overall, the F1-1 cement is interpreted to precipitate from near-surface marine.\n\n\n5.2.4\nFracture -filling calcite cement (F1-2)\nThe F1-2 calcite cements display lower \u03b418Ocarb values compared to the F1-1 cements (Fig. 11). The restored \u03b418Ow values in F1-2 cements are more positive (mean: +2.9\u2030 VSMOW), suggesting that marine pore waters evolved to basinal brine via water-rock reaction at increasingly elevated burial temperatures (Taylor, 1974). The relatively high restored \u039447 temperatures of F1-2 cement (58\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C) indicate intermediate burial conditions. In addition, positive Ce anomalies and more MREE enriched of F1-2 cement (Fig. 13A) suggest reducing environments. Moreover, the increased Mn concentrations of F1-2 cements compared to F1-1 also indicate reducing environments (Fig. 12A). Together, all these clues suggest that the F1-2 cements have an intermediate burial origin, precipitated from marine-evolved brine that have evolved towards more reducing burial conditions. Combined with regional burial-history curves (Fig. 17), the F1-2 cement was likely formed during Early to Middle Silurian intermediate burial diagenesis.\n\n\n5.2.5\nFracture-filling calcite cement (F2-1)\nThe F2-1 cements are ferroan (Fig. 12). The restored \u039447 temperatures of F2-1 cements are high, ranging from 93\u00a0\u00b0C to 125\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 14). The strong positive restored \u03b418Ow values of F2-1 cement (up to 7\u2030 VSMOW; Fig. 14) indicate basinal brine source. Alternatively, high \u03b418Ow values may be caused by magmatic fluids. Typically, magmatic fluids are characterized by a \u03b418Ow ranging between +6\u2030 and +8\u2030 VSMOW (Hoefs, 2009). Previous studies have documented magmatic activity related to the evolution of the paleo-Tethys developed in the Permian in the Tarim Basin (e.g., Li et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios in fracture calcite are inconsistent with a magma-derived fluid source (Fig. 15) because ophiolites have much lower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (i.e., \u223c0.705; Kawahata et al., 2001).\nThe REY profiles of F2-1 cement are MREE-enriched and have a lessened Ce anomaly, implying these cements precipitated from reduced burial fluids (Haley et al., 2004; Hood et al., 2018), which is in agreement with the high Fe cements (Fig. 12). In addition, some of the F2-1 cements show a positive Eu anomaly (Fig. 13B), which has been associated with hydrothermally-derived fluids (Bau and Dulski, 1999; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020). However, positive Eu anomalies can also be produced in other processes, including the breakdown of feldspars during burial diagenesis or highly reducing, organic-rich diagenetic conditions (MacRae et al., 1992; Kim et al., 2012). Together, the F2-1 cements are most likely derived from hot basinal brines. The deep-burial processes probably occurred at the end of Permian (Fig. 17), and the regional Permian magmatic activity perhaps provided heat rather than being involved directly, as discussed above.\nThe relatively wide range of the \u03b413C data in F2-1 cements (Fig. 11) may indicate a hybrid carbon source including both seawater and hydrocarbons. The less negative values may have originated from seawater, while the \u03b413C-depleted calcites may be derived from the oxidation of hydrocarbons (Wiggins et al., 1993). This is supported by the observation that some F2 fractures contain large quantities of bitumen and these bitumen-rich fractures have the lowest \u03b413C values for cements (around \u22123\u2030). The hydrocarbon-bearing fluid probably originated from the Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation black shales, which are considered the primary source rocks in the study area (Lu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2020b).\n\n\n5.2.6\nFracture-filling calcite cement (F2-2)\nThe F2-2 calcite cements are characterized by the most depleted oxygen isotope compositions (as low as \u221218.39\u2030; Fig. 11), which could be formed during a closed-system recrystallization. However, the low restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW) of F2-2 reflects calcite precipitation at higher water\/rock ratios (W\/R; water-buffered) than F2-1 and\/or mixing with meteoric water. The enriched \u03b413C values (Fig. 11) also suggest high fluid-rock ratios. In addtion, the F2-2 cements show a relatively flat profile without Eu anomaly (Fig. 13B) and low Y\/Ho (<34) (Table 2), perhaps suggesting precipitation from meteoric-derived water (Tostevin et al., 2016; Jones, 2019). This is consistent with the notably decreasing \u039447 temperatures in F2-2 cements compared to F2-1 cements (Fig. 14). Altogether, the geochemical compositions of F2-2 cements show that they precipitated at relatively low temperatures from 18O depleted meteoric water. The paleogeomorphology of the region suggests that the northern Tabei (Shaya) uplift high was probably the source of meteoric fluids that percolated far into the southern Halahatang area (He et al., 2019).\nThe restored T(\u039447) of F2-2 ranging between 52 and 86\u00a0\u00b0C suggests that these meteoric fluids were likely heated and mixed with saline brines from deeply buried parts of the basement in the burial environment. Expulsion of these fluids along steep Cambrian-rooted strike-slip faults into the Ordovician strata most likely occurred during the subsequent uplift and cooling episode of the Late Permian (Fig. 17). The decreased temperatures and \u03b418Ow values from F2-2 cements relative to F2-1 cements could be due to the rapid cooling of fluids during thermal convection and meteoric mixing processes. In some cases, the F2-2 calcite cements appear together with quartz cements (Fig. 6E and F). This mineral assemblage may have precipitated during tectonic inversion in the Late Permian. Taken in aggregate, the arguments presented above suggest that the F2-2 cements were likely sourced from basinal brines with the involvement of meteoric fluids.\nOverall, the Yijianfang Fm limestone experienced multiple dissolution-reprecipitation phases during deep burial (Fig. 10). The diagenetic fluids from different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are summarized in Table 5\n. Vugs are occluded by V1 and V2 calcite cements. The stable isotope (Fig. 11) and clumped isotope compositions (Fig. 14) reflect that V1 cements are of marine origin. V2 cements probably precipitated at shallow burial depths, which are indicated by increased clumped isotope temperatures and fluid oxygen isotope compositions (restored T\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a053\u201357\u00a0\u00b0C; restored \u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3 to +1.3\u2030 VSMOW; Fig. 14). F1-1 and F1-2 cements precipitated in horizontal fractures that were crosscut by stylolites. Sea water-like REY patterns (Fig. 13A) and clumped isotopes results indicate that F1-1 calcite cements have formed from near-surface seawater. F1-2 cements were probably precipitated in an intermediate burial reducing diagenetic environment during Early Silurian to Middle Silurian, indicated by clumped isotope (restored T\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a058\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C; restored \u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a0+1.9 to +4.4\u2030 VSMOW) and REY data (prominent Ce positive anomalies). Partial corrosion of F1-2 cements (Fig. 5F) probably indicates a change in fluid chemistry. The late F2-1 and F2-2 cements precipitated in vertical fractures that crosscut the F1 fractures and stylolites. Hot hydrocarbon-bearing F2-1 cements grew from basinal brines, indicated by high restored \u039447 temperatures (up to 125\u00a0\u00b0C) and high restored \u03b418Ow values (up to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW). Fluids that precipitated F2-2 calcites had decreased restored \u039447 temperatures (52\u201387\u00a0\u00b0C) and lower \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW). Combined with relatively flat REY profiles, F2-2 cements are likely sourced from mixed brines and meteoric water. The subsequent uplift at the end of Permian probably led to the involvement of meteoric water from the northern Tabei uplift high, accompanied by quartz cements. Pervasive dissolution was observed to be associated with F2-1 and F2-2 cements (Fig. 4E\u2013H, 8; discussed below).\n\n\n\n5.3\nOrigin of carbonate dissolution\nCore analysis shows that matrix porosities are low, ranging between 0.07% and 6.37% (mean: 1.22%; Sun et al., 2016), and cavities and fracture-vugs are the main reservoir spaces. Cavities occur as bright spots in seismic data (Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). The chance of drilling abnormalities, including bit drops and lost circulation is as high as 80% in prolific wells (Ding et al., 2020). There are some karstic features observed in the Yijianfang Fm, including cracks and vugs filled by green clays (Fig. 5G), and vugs filled with debris and sparry geopetal cements (Fig. 4A\u2013D, 5H). However, there is no definitive evidence yet for large scale near-surface karst. Typical karst breccias were only observed in the Well JY103 in Upper Odovician Tumuxiuke Fm. This is maybe linked to the subaerial exposure of the Middle Ordovician Yijianfang Fm was brief (1.5\u20132 myr; Sun et al., 2016). Instead, there is much evidence of dissolution observed associated with the F1-2 cements (Fig. 5F), indicating that this dissolution occurred during or postdated F1-2 cements. As argued above, the high restored \u039447 temperatures (58\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (1.9\u20134.4\u2030 VSMOW) and positive Ce anomalies of F1-2 cements reflect precipitation from Early to Late Silurian reducing burial fluids, within the intermediate diagenetic environments (mesogenetic dissolution). The dissolution appears to occur mainly in areas where calcite-undersaturated fluids were able to flow, e.g., along stylolites, grain-dominated facies, and fractures. In many cases, stylolites contain bitumen and other hydrocarbons (Fig. 7C\u2013E) and display fluorescence (Fig. 7F), suggesting that they had acted as hydrocarbon-bearing fluid pathways within the reservoir. The hydrocarbon emplacement is also indicated by the presence of hydrocarbon inclusions in fracture-filling calcite cements (Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2020). Previous studies suggest that the first hydrocarbon emplacement occurred during the Middle-Late Silurian, following uplift (Yang et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2020), which could generate acidic fluids resulting in burial dissolution (e.g., Mazzullo and Harris, 1992; Beavington-Penney et al., 2008). Moreover, the similar 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of both the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements (Fig. 15), compared with the coeval Early-Middle Ordovician ocean (87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.7085 to 0.7089; McArthur et al., 2020), indicate a marine or burial fluid origin. In addition to our data, Li et al. (2019) measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios for fracture-filling calcite cements, displaying similar low 87Sr\/86Sr ratios.\nVugs related to F2-1 cements have irregular edges (Fig. 8D), suggesting they were formed by dissolution. Based on the chemical signature (ferroan), the high \u039447 temperatures, and positive \u03b418Ow values, the F2-1 cements probably have a deep burial origin. As discussed above, burial fluids are probably hot deep-seated hydrocarbon-bearing brines, heated by magmatism. During the Late Devonian to Permian extensional phase, the older Ordovician faults (F1) were reactivated, and new NE-oriented faults\/fractures (F2) were created (Li et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2019). Thus, tectonically-driven, hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal fluids circulated through fractures, resulting in the precipitation of F2-1 cements and dissolution. The dissolution may be caused by organic acids formed in the second hydrocarbon emplacement event during the Permian (linked to Hercynian tectonism) (Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). In addition, as documented in previous work, as the deep-seated high temperature fluids move to shallower depths along steep strike-slip faults, the temperatures of the fluids become lower, and the fluids can become undersaturated with respect to calcite (van Berk et al., 2015), which could result in dissolution. High-quality seismic data show large-scale strike-slip faults can provide subvertical pathways for fluids to migrate from the Cambrian source rock (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b) (Fig. 3).\nDuring the following Late Permian uplift, deep circulation of meteoric fluids from elevated recharge areas may have occurred due to reduced temperatures and pressures. The low restored \u03b418Ow values of \u22125.9 to \u22120.9\u2030 VSMOW for F2-2 cement indicate a meteoric influence. Meteoric fluids, probably sourced from the northeast paleo-high (He et al., 2019), circulated into the basin, mixed with hot 18O-enriched brines, and then discharged upwards through the sub-vertical fractures. Variations in the amount of mixing may explain the large range of \u03b418Ow values and temperatures derived from the clumped and stable isotopes (Fig. 14). Such fluids move along fractures and cause dissolution (Fig. 8A), forming enlarged fractures and caverns. The minor quartz cements (Fig. 6E and F) were likely formed during the mixing of cool meteoric water with hot basinal fluids, which is also reported by Cai et al. (2008).\nDeep burial thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR; Orr, 1977; Machel, 1987) could also be a possible dissolution mechanism. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) associated with oil, is expelled from the basin, and sulfuric acid can form by mixing with more oxidized fluids (Hill, 1990). These sulfuric acid-bearing fluids can dissolve the limestone in the subsurface, producing large cave systems. Chang et al. (2017) documented that heavy crude oil, which was produced during the first oil accumulation in the Silurian, is rich in H2S, and sulfur content can be as high as 2%. Thermochemcial sulfate reduction (TSR) usually requires a high temperature (100\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C) (Machel, 2001; Jiang et al., 2018a, b). Thus, H2S-related dissolution could explain the observed instances of dissolution in F2 fractures, where there is evidence for fluid temperatures over 100\u00a0\u00b0C. However, given the absence of gypsum and depleted \u03b413C values, major H2S-related dissolution is not supported.\nIn summary, the most likely mechanism for the formation of the reservoirs is burial dissolution, especially related to the multi-stage hydrocarbon emplacements along the vertical strike-slip faults. In addition, the late, deeply circulated meteoric water favors the further dissolution along the F2 fractures.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for reservoir studies\nDuring the Middle Ordovician, the tectonic setting of the Tarim Basin changed from extensional to compressional, caused by the closure of the Kudi ocean in the southwest of the Tarim Block (Li et al., 2013). The subduction and collision processes of the orogenic belts caused the development of NE and NW trending transpressional faults (F1) under a pure shear stress mechanism. During the compressive phase, meteoric fluids may have flowed along early F1 faults, resulting in the formation of some cavities and vugs. However, vugs are generally occluded by V1 and V2 cements (Figs. 5G and 9), which precipitated from marine and increasing burial diagenetic environment (see discussion above). The geochemical data of V1 and V2 overlap with that of F1 and F2 (Figs. 11 and 14), indicating that early F1 fractures probably acted as conduits for the deposition of vug-filling cements. In general, the evidence for early meteoric karst in Yijianfang Fm is weak, and this is consistent with recent studies by Fu (2019) and Baqu\u00e9s et al. (2020).\nAs discussed above, hydrocarbon-bearing fluids are involved in several burial dissolution processes (from F1-2 to F2-1 cements related dissolution). The large volume of F2-1 calcite cement indicates that upward migration of hydrocarbon-bearing brines to the Ordovician reservoirs was a widespread process in the studied area (Figs. 8 and 17). Thus, the hydrocarbon-bearing fluids seem the essential dissolution mechanism in the study area. Similarly, the upward migration of hydrocarbons along with hot brine flow along faults was responsible for the oil accumulation observed in the Michigan Basin (Vogler et al., 1981). Statistics on hydrocarbon charging worldwide (Table 6\n) show hydrocarbon charge exists during deep burial, especially in Cratonic Basin.\nUltimately, an involvement of deeply circulated meteoric water sourced from the northern Tabei topographic high during the Late Permian's uplift could further improve the reservoir quality. He et al. (2019) suggested that the reservoir porosity was controlled by deeply circulated karst along faults. However, they did not provide convincing evidence of deeply circulated meteoric water. This study presents geochemical evidence for deeply circulated meteoric water using clumped and stable isotope analyses (negative restored \u03b418Ow values: down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), which seems to contribute to carbonate dissolution.\nThe distinct tectonic-fluid evolution between F1 and F2 fractures may be linked to tectonic stress and\/or strain differences. The early F1 fractures are transpressional (Zheng et al., 2019), conducive to increasing lateral permeability of the fault zone. This likely created favorable conditions for horizontal migration of tectonic fluids (Salvini et al., 1999). Thus, the early meteoric fluids developed mainly along F1 fractures. Nevertherless, as argued above, hot burial fluids along F2 fractures were probably generated during the Late Devonian to Late Permian extensional (transtensional) regime, indicated by (\u2170) negative \u03b418Ocarb and positive \u03b418Ow; (\u2171) high concentrations of Fe and Sr; and (\u2172) enrichments in MREE and some positive Eu anomalies recorded in F2-1 cements. The F2 sub-vertical strike-slip faults probably facilitated deep burial fluid flow. Deep basinal fluid flow require that faults are open, which usually occurs within extensional basins (Hollis et al., 2017; Hirani et al., 2018). Similar fluid-flow evolution scenarios have previously been suggested for extensional and\/or strike-slip faults settings elsewhere in the world (e.g., Davies and Smith, 2006; Klimchouk, 2017; Bertotti et al., 2020).\nTectonic activity is the most likely driving mechanism for fluid flow, as transporting such deep-seated fluids into the near-surface requires high angle, permeable conduits, such as faults. These faults are the conduits for vertical migration of the hydrocarbon-bearing fluids from the Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation to the Ordovician Formation during episodes of tectonic activity. It is worth noting that in thin section, a well-developed micro-fracture network is commonly observed. These microfractures are invisible in plane light (Fig. 7G) but are obvious on fluorescent images (Fig. 7H). The strong fluorescence indicates microfractures serve as hydrocarbon migration paths. These microfractures may play an essential role in the hydrocarbon migration in the deeply buried reservoirs. In summary, hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and basement-rooted strike-slip faults may be critical factors controlling the distribution of the deeply buried carbonate reservoirs in cratonic basins.\nIn contrast to the southern Shunbei and Shunnan area, which shows volcanic events-related hydrothermal dolomitization and silicification controlled by strike-slip fault systems (Cong et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021), there is no evidence for these features in our study area. The data presented here suggest that the reservoir porosity is a result of mesogenetic dissolution by several stages of hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and deeply circulated meteoric water. Thus, the reservoir-forming mechanisms in the north and south of the transitional zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions may be different. Further structural and diagenetic work needs to be done to explain the different deep fluid origins in the transitional zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions. In future exploration, the reservoirs situated between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions are the most critical industrial exploration target, and the findings of this study may have significant economic implications.\nIn summary, our study suggests that fault-related circulation of hot hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and the deeply circulated meteoric waters were important in producing porosity within the southern Halahatang reservoir. Our work implies that different tectonic regimes can result in distinct fluid flow mechanisms within carbonate reservoirs. The transpressional regime created favorable conditions for horizontal migration of fluids, while the extensional (transtensional) regime facilitated deep burial fluid flow. These findings may be applicable to other geodynamically-active cratonic basins.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nCarbon and oxygen isotope analysis by SIMS, paired with trace elements, REY, clumped isotope, and strontium isotope analyses of calcite cements from different fracture generations are used to reconstruct a history of regional tectonic fluid flow in the Early-Middle Ordovician carbonate reservoirs in the southern part of Halahatang Oilfield. Based on detailed petrographic observations from core samples, two sets of fractures are identified. The first set of fractures (F1) are sub-horizontal or oblique and crosscut by stylolites. The F1 fractures are dominantly filled by debris and sparry geopetal cements. In contrast, the second set of fractures (F2) are sub-vertical, postdate stylolites and mainly cemented by calcite, usually accompanied by bitumen.\nThe F1-1 cements show \u03b418O and \u03b413C values and REY profiles comparable to those of coeval seawater. Moreover, these cements have restored \u03b418Ow values (mean: \u22121.7\u2030 VSMOW) and restored temperatures (mean: 27\u00a0\u00b0C) derived from clumped isotopes that are consistent with Ordovician seawater. All these suggest that they probably precipitated from near-surface marine environment. In contrast, light \u03b418Ocarb, relatively high restored \u03b418Ow values (mean: +2.9\u2030 VSMOW) and high restored \u039447 temperatures (mean: 65\u00a0\u00b0C), as well as the positive Ce anomalies in F1-2 cements, indicate precipitation in a intermediate burial reducing diagenetic environment.\nF2-1 cements may have originated from hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal brines derived from the Cambrian strata during Permian tectonic activity. This is indicated by the high restored \u039447 temperatures (93\u2013125\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (+4.9 to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW), and enrichments in MREE in F2-1 cement. Permian extension is the most likely tectonic event that drove the expulsion of the hot fluids from the basin through the newly formed and reactivated fractures.\nThe significantly negative \u03b418Ocarb values (\u221218 to \u22129\u2030 PDB), low restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), decreased restored \u039447 temperatures (52\u201387\u00a0\u00b0C), low concentrations of Sr, and relatively flat REY profiles in F2-2 cement suggest that the fluid may be derived from mixture of meteoric water and brines. The inputs of meteoric waters may be from the northern Tabei (Shaya) uplift, which experienced deep circulation and migrated into the burial environment along faults during the uplift of the Late Permian.\nOur new data highlights that acidic fluids associated with hydrocarbons may be an important corrosive agent in our study area during the burial. The ubiquitous presence of fluorescence in stylolites and micro-fractures indicates that they acted as pathways for hydrocarbon-bearing fluids flow. Hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and Cambrian-rooted strike-slip faults are critical factors governing the distribution of the reservoirs.\nThis work improves our knowledge that the past complex tectonic-fluid flows occurred in different tectonic regimes, especially a transtensional regime that facilitated late deep basinal brines flow. Because such tectonic settings are widely observed over the world, structurally controlled fluid-flow reservoirs are expected to be found in many other regions, which will ultimately help predict the distribution of deeply buried reservoirs. Thus, our studies here can function as an analog to other deeply buried sedimentary basins.\n\n","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nMethane gas hydrate is a naturally-occurring crystalline solid in which methane molecules are encaged in a lattice of water molecules (Sloan and Koh, 2007). The methane hydrate stability and formation requirements of moderate temperature, elevated pressure and sufficient methane and water supply (Kvenvolden, 1993) are met in continental margin and permafrost-associated sediment, yielding a global distribution of methane hydrate (Kvenvolden et al., 1993; Waite et al., 2020; Wallmann et al., 2012). In 2005, South Korea began a \u201c10-year Korean National Gas Hydrate Program\u201d as part of a national effort to reduce dependence on foreign energy resources, carrying out the Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate expeditions (UBGH1 in 2007, UBGH2 in 2010) to assess the domestic resource potential of methane hydrate (Ryu et al., 2013).\nSouth Korea signed the Paris Agreement, seeking to limit the global temperature change to less than 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C above levels prior to the Industrial Revolution (Falkner, 2016; United Nations, 2016). Methane is seen as a viable bridge fuel, a transitional energy with lower net carbon emission than oil and coal (Levi, 2013; Tanaka et al., 2019; Kastner et al., 2022), that could be used while existing challenges to a direct conversion from fossil fuels to renewable energy (summarized by Halkos and Gkampoura (2020)) are addressed. For the extraction of methane from gas hydrate to be commercially viable however, a number of technical challenges must be overcome (Hancock et al., 2019), including the potential for production flow rate limitations due to reservoir compression (e.g. Boswell et al., 2019; Flemings et al., 2020; Myshakin et al., 2019), clogging due to the migration of sediment particles (e.g., Cao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020a; Jung et al., 2012; Uchida et al., 2019; Valdes and Santamarina, 2007), and lack of reservoir pressure isolation from bounding sedimentary units (e.g., Ajayi et al., 2018; Jang et al., 2020b; Konno et al., 2019; Moridis et al., 2019a). Conventional hydrocarbon production can also be hampered if the production well design and operations do not account for gas hydrate in the overlying sediment (Hadley et al., 2008).\nPotentially significant contributions to these production challenges depend on the type, concentration, and distribution of fine-grained particles, or \u201cfines,\u201d at the production site. Fines are particles smaller than 75\u00a0\u03bcm-diameter and include silt and clay in the unified soil classification system (USCS; ASTM, 2011a). Whereas course-grained particle interactions are dominated by gravitational forces, fines are small enough to be influenced by electrical forces due to their unbalanced surface charges (Lambe and Whitman, 1969). The magnitude and distribution of these surface charges depend on the particle mineralogy and size, so the particle characteristics as well as the pore fluid chemistry between the particles all affect the particle arrangements (sediment fabric) and consequently affect sediment properties such as compressibility, permeability, and particle mobility (reviewed in Cao et al. (2019); Jang et al. (2018)).\nThe dependence of these properties on fines is particularly significant when extracting methane from gas hydrate via reservoir depressurization, which is seen as the most promising production technique (Boswell et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2019). The depressurization method reduces in situ pore pressure, destabilizing methane hydrate so it releases methane gas and pure water. Mechanically, the depressurization method increases vertical effective stress, particularly in deepwater systems such as the Ulleung Basin because the pore pressure must be reduced by several MPa or more to destabilize gas hydrate in these environments (Boswell et al., 2019; Moridis et al., 2019b). The effective stress increase compresses the affected sediments, which the well structure must be designed to accommodate (Hancock et al., 2019), and also reduces reservoir permeability due to the porosity loss ( Yoneda et al., 2019b). Myshakin et al. (2019) showed the permeability reduction can be significant, with permeability dropping by two orders of magnitude during depressurization for a modeled production test offshore India.\nPore-water chemistry also changes as methane hydrate breakdown releases fresh water, reducing the in-situ salinity by 55\u201365% for methane hydrate saturations of 60\u201370% (Jang et al., 2020a). Depending on the electrical sensitivity of the fines (Jang and Santamarina, 2016a; Jang et al., 2018), interactions between fines can be sensitive to the pore water salinity, leading to a range of potential reservoir property changes as the pore water freshens. Pore-water freshening can alter the fines compressibility (Bolt, 1956; Olson and Mesri, 1970), the tendency for fines to resuspend and become entrained with fluids and gas flowing toward the production well (Mohan et al., 1993; Jang et al., 2020a), and the capacity for fines to cluster and clog pore throats to reduce reservoir permeability (Lambe and Whitman, 1969; Cao et al., 2019).\nIn this work, we focus on the impact of diatoms, a type of photosynthetic microalgae found in the photic zone of the water column, on sediment properties. When diatoms die, they leave behind a porous, silica-based skeleton that can settle to the seafloor and get incorporated into the sediment. The global distribution of diatom skeletons in sediment depends on geologic, oceanic and climate conditions that can affect productivity of diatoms (Cortese et al., 2004; Cawthern et al., 2014) and whether or not their skeletons dissolve before they reach the seafloor (Kamatani and Riley, 1979; Treguer et al., 1995). Diatom skeletons (or \u201cfrustules,\u201d but simply referred to as \u201cdiatoms\u201d in this work), exhibit a wide variety of morphologies (Fig. 1\n. See also Fig. 6 in Jang et al., 2020a), but typically have lower density than the surrounding sediment grains due to the pores, holes and other \u201cinternal porosity\u201d (Fig. 1) that the diatom skeletons have for their strength and protection (Zglobicka et al., 2017).\nThe structure and arrangement of diatoms, particularly in fine-grained sediment, have significant impact not only on where and how much gas hydrate can accumulate in the sediment, but also on how the host sediment will respond when the hydrate breaks down naturally or as a result of human energy recovery efforts. As an example, the presence of internal pores and pore space formed from enmeshed diatoms (Fig. 1) provides gas hydrate nucleation surfaces (Bahk et al., 2013a.; Dai et al., 2014) and pore spaces that are larger than what is typically available in diatom-free fine-grained sediment (Lei and Santamarina, 2018; Kraemer et al., 2000). As an example, Kraemer et al. (2000) observed that hydrate was present in diatom-rich layers and absent from intervening, diatom-poor layers along the Blake Ridge, offshore eastern USA. Mechanistically, diatoms enhance hydrate formation because the larger pore spaces they create allow for hydrate to grow at lower levels of pore-water methane concentration (Kraemer et al., 2000) than in the surrounding fine-grained sediment. In the aspect of mechanical behavior of sediments relevant to energy extraction activities, the composition and structure of diatoms strongly increases overall sediment compressibility (Kwon et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011), and can also enhance pore-throat clogging that reduces the efficiency of extracting methane from gas hydrate (Cao et al., 2019).\nTo gain insight into the potential impact of diatoms on a range of potential hydrate-associated gas hydrate dissociation and gas production processes in the Ulleung Basin, we performed a suite of index property, imagery, sedimentation, and compressibility studies on sediment from four UBGH2 sites (Table 1\n). The four sites chosen for this study cover a range of hydrate morphologies and energy resource potential: two sites (UBGH2-2-2 and UBGH2-6) have gas hydrate concentrated in thin, coarse-grained layers interbedded with fine-grained sediment, and UBGH2-6 has been considered a potential production test site. Two sites (Sites UBGH2-3 and UBGH2-11) are associated with gas hydrate-filled veins and fractures in fine-grained sediment adjacent to a gas hydrate chimney, and one site (Site UBGH2-3) has hydrate-filled veins and fractures in fine-grained sediment associated with an underlying conventional petroleum field (Ryu et al., 2013).\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe tectonic history of the Ulleung Basin, a back-arc basin in the East Sea (Fig. 2\n), is described in detail by Chough and Barg (1987) and has been reviewed in reference to the UBGH1 and UBGH2 expeditions by Ryu et al. (2009) and Bahk et al. (2013a). For this study, it is important to note the effects of tectonic compression on the Ulleung Basin beginning in the late Miocene (Chough and Barg, 1987). Compression caused uplift in the southern part of the basin, and combined with rapid sedimentation, led to a series of mass transport events that reworked and moved sediment toward the north (Lee et al., 2001).\nSediment transport in the central and northern portions of the Ulleung Basin since the late Miocene generally resulted in turbidite flows separated by intervals of hemipelagic sedimentation (Lee et al., 2001), creating a layered series of coarse- and fine-grained sediment. Basin compression has continued to the present time (Ingle, 1992), inducing sediment deformation and faulting, driving upward fluid flow while creating permeable pathways that are thought to promote fluid migration into the observed zones of methane hydrate occurrence in UBGH1 and UBGH2 (Ryu et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2013). The sedimentary environments for the four UBGH2 sites in this study are summarized in Fig. 3\n, Table 2\n, and as follows:\n\n2.1\nUBGH2-2-2\nUBGH2-2-2, like UBGH2-11 (Section 2.4), is adjacent to site UBGH1-9, a chimney structure with no surface expression that was cored during the first UBGH expedition (Kim et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2012). UBGH2-2-2 is outside the chimney region, in a zone of flat-lying seismic reflections (see Fig. 3 in Kim et al., 2013c) potentially indicating hydrate-bearing, coarse-grained units. Coring results revealed the site was primarily fine-grained pelagic sediment, though a few thin (1\u201314\u00a0cm thick, averaging 3\u00a0cm thick), coarser-grained layers of sand and ash were also present (Ryu et al., 2013). Gas hydrate was associated with some of those coarse-grained layers (Bahk et al., 2013a; Lee et al., 2013b; Ryu et al., 2013), and was also disseminated in diatom-rich silts and found as fracture-fill in fine-grained sediment (Bahk et al., 2013a). The site is used here, along with UBGH2-6 (Section 2.3), to examine how diatom-rich sediment could impact efforts to extract methane from hydrates in thin, coarse-grained units within primarily fine-grained systems.\n\n\n2.2\nUBGH2-3\nThe southern-most site in this study is a seismically-imaged chimney structure that reaches the surface as a mound (see Fig. 3 in Kim et al., 2013a). Logging results indicating the chimney hosts gas hydrate in many small vertical fractures (Lee and Collett, 2013), were confirmed in pressure cored samples containing numerous hydrate-filled fractures in fine-grained sediment (Lee et al., 2013b). Around 10 and 13\u00a0meters below seafloor, mbsf, hydrate appears to displace enough sediment to appear as \u201cmassive\u201d gas hydrate occurrences (Lee and Collett, 2013) that can be on the order of tens of cm thick when cored (e.g., Fig. 6 in Ryu et al., 2013). UBGH2-3 is associated with the neighboring Donghae-1 commercial gas field and was initially thought to be supplied by thermogenic gas, but no thermogenic gases were ultimately identified at the site (Ryu et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the site is used here to examine how hydrates in diatom-rich sediment can impact the production of underlying conventional hydrocarbons.\n\n\n2.3\nUBGH2-6\nUBGH2-6 is located in the northern part of the Ulleung Basin, where Lee et al. (2001) mapped flat-lying sequences of coarse-grained turbidite layers separated by fine-grained hemipelagic sediment. Strong seismic reflections just above the base of hydrate stability (see Fig. 1 in Lee and Collett, 2013) indicated gas hydrate could be present in the coarse-grained layers. Coring revealed coarse-grained layers 1\u2013148\u00a0cm thick, averaging 9\u00a0cm thick (Ryu et al., 2013), with two hydrate-bearing intervals exceeding 30\u00a0cm each (Lee et al., 2013b). The hydrate-bearing layers were interbedded with fine-grained, hydrate-free hemipelagic layers that varied from the centimeter- to meter-scale in thickness (Bahk et al., 2013b; Ryu et al., 2013). UBGH2-6 has been considered for a potential production test to extract methane from hydrate (Ryu et al., 2013), and is used here to illustrate how diatoms can influence production from an interbedded coarse- and fine-grained reservoir.\n\n\n2.4\nUBGH2-11\nUBGH2-11 targets a chimney structure adjacent to UBGH1-9 that seismic images suggest reaches the seafloor (see Fig. 4 in Kim et al., 2013a). The chimney sediment is primarily fine-grained, though does host thin, discrete coarse-grained bodies (Lee et al., 2013b). Hydrate is primarily observed as fractures displacing fine-grained sediment, with thin, isolated, hydrate-free sand bodies observed adjacent to the hydrate-filled fractures (Lee et al., 2013b). As observed at UBGH2-3, grain-displacing hydrate occurrences have grown in the upper portion of the chimney to represent massive, nearly sediment-free bodies of gas hydrate (Kim et al., 2013a). UBGH2-11 is used here to illustrate the impact of diatoms on the potential for extracting methane from hydrate filled fractures as well as from massive gas hydrate occurrences in fine-grained sediment.\n\n\n\n3\nMaterials\n\nTable 2 summarizes the sample identification and recovery depths for the sediment samples tested here. To facilitate the discussion of diatom effects on reservoir productivity, we classify our study material according to a series of idealized elements of hydrate-bearing reservoir systems (sediment classifications are shown schematically in Fig. 3).\nAn important consideration when attributing an idealized element classification to the sediments in this study (first column in Table 2) is the length scale over which that sediment lithology occurs. With the exception of the massive gas hydrates (e.g., UBGH2-3 and UBGH2-11), and the thicker sands observed at UBGH2-6 (some exceeding 30\u00a0cm thickness), many of the sediment lithologies cored during UBGH2 were coherent only over the scale of several centimeters or less. Predominantly fine-grained sediment units were interspersed with hydrate-bearing fractures (e.g., UBGH2-3), or isolated, thin sand bodies (e.g., upper UBGH2-2-2 sample and UBGH2-11), or were sandwiched between coarse-grained turbidite layers (e.g., lower UBGH2-2-2 sample and UBGH2-6). Isolating these lithologies for study requires undisturbed sediment core sections.\nIn the absence of gas hydrate, conventional coring technology retains in situ sediment layering, though with drilling disturbances. When hydrate-bearing conventional cores are brought to the drilling ship, methane hydrate present in the core can further disturb the sediment as the hydrate dissociates due to lack of in situ pressure. As noted for UBGH2 by Bahk et al. (2013b), hydrate dissociation during core recovery obscured the in situ sediment layering. Pressure coring, which preserves sediments at or near their in situ pore pressure, can help preserve in situ gas hydrate and the adjacent sedimentary layers during coring for geotechnical property measurements (e.g., Schultheiss et al. (2009); Santamarina et al. (2012); the technological history of pressure coring is reviewed in Dai et al. (2017); Thomas et al. (2020)). All specimens tested here were collected in pressure cores.\n\n\n4\nMethods\nOur focus here is on compressibility, permeability and how those properties evolve and impact production activities. As shown by measured (Yoneda et al., 2019b) and modeled (Myshakin et al., 2019) results, highly-compressible sediment will experience porosity and permeability reduction that can limit overall production rates when that highly-compressible sediment is exposed to the elevated effective stresses imposed while methane is produced from gas hydrate-bearing sediments (Boswell et al., 2019). To understand what controls the compressibility of fine-grained sediments associated with gas hydrate in the Ulleung Basin, we combine one-dimensional (1D) consolidation tests with the suite of physical property measurements summarized in Table 3\n. The measurement strategy is summarized here.\nWe use particle size, specific gravity and specific surface area data to indicate the extent to which the sediment behavior can be influenced by the electrical charge imbalances on individual sediment grains. The general rule is that the most easily-influenced particles are small (fine-grained), low-density, and have high surface area for hosting electrical charges. Larger (coarse-grained), dense, rounded (low surface area) particles such as sands are more influenced by gravitation than electrical forces.\nGrain-size analysis was conducted onshore using a laser-scattering particle analyzer (Microtrac S3500). The specimens were dried in a freeze drier for 24\u00a0h. Dried specimens were treated in 10% H2O2 solutions at 80\u00a0\u00b0C to remove organic material. After removing the organics, specimens were treated in 1\u00a0M HCl for 24\u00a0h to remove carbonates. Specimens were then cleansed in deionized water until the pH was neutral. To reduce particle clumping, specimens were combined with a 0.1% sodium hexametaphosphate, (NaPO3)6, solution in a vortex mixer.\nOptical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imagery indicate particle morphology including individual grain shapes as well as the tendency of particles to clump due to electrical attraction (Jang et al., 2019b). SEM images with energy-dispersive-spectroscopy (EDS) can also reveal the presence of diatoms and identify chemical elements in the samples to support image-based interpretations of sediment content (e.g., Jang et al., 2019a, 2020a).\nMineral compositions were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and a computer software (SIROQUANT) based on the Rietveld quantification method. For the XRD analysis, a Philips X'pert MPD diffractometer was used with a CuK\u03b1 radiation source and run at 40\u00a0kV and 20\u00a0mA. XRD mineralogy data highlight the dominant sediment components. With component information in hand, published compressibility data for pure, endmember fines (e.g., Jang et al., 2018) can be used to anticipate specimen behavior. However, certain sediment components, such as montmorillonite, can be difficult to identify in standard XRD data, or can be difficult to discriminate from similar sediment components (e.g., differentiating mica and illite). XRD interpretations can be qualitatively augmented with the grain-settling-based sedimentation tests, in which sediment is allowed to settle in fluid columns (Fig. 4\na).\nWhen free falling in liquid, sediment grains in the grain-settling-based sedimentation tests can segregate based on grain size and electrical sensitivity, forming fabrics due to inter-particle forces such as gravitational and electrical forces (Jang et al., 2018, 2020a). We analyze these grain-settling-based sedimentation tests in conjunction with grain size, mineralogy, and pore-fluid chemistry data. Following the techniques described in Jang et al. (2018, 2020a) for sedimentation tests, a volume of dry sediment was loosely packed into a mold having a 25.4\u00a0mm diameter and height as shown in Fig. 4a. That sediment was then allowed to settle in a fluid-filled sedimentation cylinder (Fig. 4a). In this study, we used a range of fluid salinities (deionized water, 0.6\u00a0m and 2\u00a0m brine, where m is molal, or moles of salt per kilogram of deionized water) to investigate the sediment response to pore-water freshening. We also used the (NaPO3)6 dispersant to investigate the sediment's capacity to cluster, clump and settle in the absence of interparticle electrical attractions. How sedimentation progresses in different pore fluids determines the sediment fabric, and hence the sediment compressibility (Jang et al., 2018).\nAs expected for marine sediment and as observed in our XRD results, the in situ pore water was a brine, and salt from that brine precipitated onto the sediment grains when the sediment was dried in the laboratory. Consequently, for the initial sedimentation test, even though the cylinder was filled with deionized water (DW), precipitated salts dissolving off the sediment grains into the cylinder water created a weak brine, which was less saline than the nominal 0.6\u00a0m salinity of seawater, and we denote these samples as \u201cdeionized water with salt (DWS).\u201d To prepare for the second sedimentation test, the DWS sample's supernatant was removed and replaced with additional DW to create the \u201cdeionized water-freshened (DWF)\u201d sample that represents the lowest salinity test in our study. Finally, the supernatant was replaced with 2\u00a0m-brine (116.88\u00a0g NaCl per kg deionized water) to observe the sedimentation in a high salinity fluid. The cylinder was shaken for 60\u00a0s prior to each sedimentation test, then left undisturbed while the depositional and accumulated sediment heights (Fig. 4a) were measured over time.\nThe extent to which electrical interactions between pore fluids and particles control sediment fabric and compressibility can be quantified via the liquid plastic limit test (empirical correlations are given in Table 4\n and discussed in Section 5). As water is added to a soil, the soil transitions from a solid to a semisolid, plastic, and eventually liquid state; the plastic limit, PL, is the water content at which the sediment transitions from semisolid to plastic behavior, and the liquid limit, LL, similarly indicates the water content separating plastic and liquid behaviors. As Lambe and Whitman (1969) note, a clayey, fine-grained soil that is better able to attract water to the sediment grain surface should have larger plastic and liquid limits, meaning these limits will depend on soil constituents as well as grain size. A related parameter, the plasticity index, PI\u00a0=\u00a0LL-PL, gives the range of water contents over which the sediment can be molded into arbitrary shapes.\nThe liquid limit also provides a quantitative link between the sedimentation test implications for the sediment void ratio (open versus dense fabric) and the ideal initial void ratio for the 1D consolidation test. When the soil is saturated, initial void ratio, e\n\n0\n, water content, w\n\nc\n and the specific sediment density, G\n\ns\n, are related by:\n\n[1]\n\n\n\ne\n0\n\n=\n\n\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\n\ne\n\nv\no\ni\nd\ns\n\n\n\n\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\n\ne\n\ns\no\nl\ni\nd\ns\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nm\na\ns\n\ns\n\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\n\n\n\n\nm\na\ns\n\ns\n\ns\no\nl\ni\nd\ns\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\nd\ne\nn\ns\ni\nt\n\ny\n\ns\no\nl\ni\nd\ns\n\n\n\n\nd\ne\nn\ns\ni\nt\n\ny\n\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nw\nc\n\n\u00b7\n\nG\ns\n\n=\n1.2\n\u00b7\n\n\nL\nL\n\n100\n\n\u00b7\n\nG\ns\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere we are following the procedure of Jang et al. (2018) in choosing the particular water content w\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00b7LL as our initial water content when preparing the remolded specimen for a 1D consolidation test. Equation (1) requires unitless parameters, so LL\/100 is used because LL is generally reported in % rather than unitless form. Specimens with higher initial void ratios are generally more compressible (Table 4), though as we see in this study, other factors can contribute to the compressibility. Specimens were reused when the specimen volumes were too small to conduct separate liquid limit tests for the range of fluids used in this study.\nSediment compressibility data can help guide predictions of the reservoir permeability evolution during production (e.g., Boswell et al., 2019; Myshakin et al., 2019), so 1-D incremental loading consolidation tests were run to constrain the sediment compressibility, permeability, and how these parameters change as pore-water freshens during production (Fig. 4b). In this study, pore-water salinity was controlled in two ways for the consolidation tests: using either DW, 0.6\u00a0m- or 2\u00a0m-brine, the specimen was initially saturated to 120% of the liquid limit water content (w\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00b7LL); then we used either DW, 0.6\u00a0m or 2\u00a0m brine as the consolidation reservoir fluid (Fig. 4b) to maintain specimen saturation during the consolidation test. To test the response of compressibility to pore water chemistry changes, we replaced the reservoir fluid after the first loading and unloading cycle. During the reloading cycle, the reservoir fluid salinity was changed as noted in the results for each specimen.\nThe consolidation test procedure started with preparing the specimen at a nominal 10\u00a0kPa of vertical stress, \u03c3\u2032. The stress was then increased by doubling in steps up to 2.560\u00a0MPa. This first loading process provides the compression index (C\n\nc\n). The unloading procedure was to remove the load in two steps so the swelling index (C\n\ns\n) could be obtained. The reservoir fluid was replaced, and we repeated the loading procedure to get the recompression index (C\n\nr\n) and the unloading steps for C\n\ns\n. The indices from the consolidation test are obtained by e-log\u03c3\u2032 curve:\n\n[2]\n\n\n\nC\nc\n\n,\n\n\nC\ns\n\n,\n\no\nr\n\n\nC\nr\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\ne\n\n1000\nk\nP\na\n\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\n100\nk\nP\na\n\n\n\n\nl\no\ng\n1000\nk\nP\na\n\u2212\nl\no\ng\n100\nk\nP\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of limited sample volumes, two samples could not be consolidated: 3C-3P from UBGH2-3 and 6C-6P from UBGH2-6.\nAt each consolidation step, the hydraulic conductivity, K, was measured based on the consolidation theory approach from Terzaghi et al.

The coefficient of volume compressibility, m\n\nv\n, is calculated from the change in stress, \u0394\u03c3, and void ratio, \u0394e, at each consolidation step:\n\n[4]\n\n\n\nm\nv\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u0394\ne\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\ne\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand e\n\ni\n is taken as the void ratio at the beginning of each step.

We build on a series of \u201ckey takeaways\u201d from our index property, sedimentation, liquid limit and 1D consolidation tests (Table 5\n). In this section, we describe how the measurement results shape our understanding of the compressibility and permeability behavior.\n\n5.1\nSediment characterization\nThe UBGH2 sediment characterization is summarized in Table 6\n (index properties), Table 7\n (mineralogy), and Fig. 5\n (sediment imagery). Based on grain size, sediment tested in this study is all classified as clayey silt according to the Wentworth classification scheme (Wentworth, 1922). Based on their liquid limit and plasticity index values, the samples are classified as elastic silt, designated as MH in the unified soil classification system (USCS, ASTM D2487 (ASTM, 2011a)). Fig. 5a and b shows that sediments clumped as they dried prior to being imaged, indicating the importance of electrical interactions in controlling the behavior of these fine-grained sediments.\nAs anticipated from in situ logging data (Bahk et al., 2013b), mineralogy data (Table 7) indicate diatoms are present in all samples studied here, and are particularly abundant in the samples from UBGH2-6B,C and the deepest UBGH2-3C sample. SEM imagery confirms diatoms are present, primarily as fragments, but with some specimens remaining largely intact (Figs. 1 and 5d,e). XRD mineralogy results confirm quartz, mica and feldspars are also significant sediment components at our test locations (Table 7), but diatoms play a critical role in determining the measured index properties. As measured by Jang et al. (2018), the internal porosity of the diatom structure (Zglobicka et al., 2017) leads to low specific density (G\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a02.23) and high specific surface area (S\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a098) relative to other sediment components. The diatom contents are high enough, particularly in the imaged UBGH2-3 and UBGH2-6 samples, to measurably reduce the specific gravity and dry weight of sedimentation test specimens (Table 6), but increase the specific surface area results relative to the specimens with lower diatom content.\n\n\n5.2\nSedimentation behavior\n\nFig. 6\n shows sedimentation test results for UBGH2-2-2B 11H-4, UBGH2-3C 3P, UBGH2-3C 15P, and UBGH2-11B 16P. The sedimentation test results illustrate the free-fall, or sedimentation patterns of particles. The fine-grained sediment particles interact with each other and the pore fluid to form clusters, which can then settle. As the particles settle, the depositional height falls, and the accumulated sediment height increases (Fig. 4a). Clustering is controlled by the unbalanced surface charges on the particles and by the ionic concentrations in the pore fluid (Lambe and Whitman, 1969). Thus, the pore fluids affect the sedimentation results, and varying the pore-fluid chemistry yields information about which sediment components control the sedimentation behavior.\nFor all UBGH2 samples tested (Fig. 6, and for the mud interbed samples UBGH2-2-2B 15C, UBGH2-6B 18H-3C, and UBGH2-6C 6P, refer to Fig. 7 of Jang et al. (2020a)), the fine particles in the freshest water (DWF) stay suspended longer than in the more saline DWS. The DWF results are similar to the results of (NaPO3)6, the dispersant used to prevent clustering and subsequent settling. Sedimentation in DWS and 2\u00a0m-brine pore fluid behaves as expected when silica silt or diatoms are dominant (Fig. 8 in Jang et al. (2020a)). For silica silt and diatoms, even small ionic concentrations can reduce settling time by promoting fine particle clustering. The mica and illite content are nearly as high and sometimes higher than the diatom or quartz (silica) content, but mica and illite settle more rapidly as pore water freshens. If mica and illite were controlling factors in the UBGH2 sedimentation tests, the DWF and DWS sedimentation rates would be faster than the 2\u00a0m-brine sedimentation rates (open symbols in Fig. 6), but this is the opposite of what we observe. Since the sedimentation rates for the UBGH2 sites listed in Table 1 get faster as the salinity increases, we conclude the sedimentation is controlled by the diatoms and small quartz particles observed in the XRD mineralogy and SEM imagery.\n\n\n5.3\nLiquid and plastic limits\nIn this study, two liquid limit comparisons are of particular relevance: how liquid limit depends on salinity, and how liquid limit changes as a result of a compressibility test. As shown in Table 6, the liquid limit of each sample with deionized water (LL\n\nDW\n) is greater than the liquid limit of the sample with 2\u00a0m brine (LL\n\n2m,corr\n). This suggests the sediment fabric will seek to be more open as pore-water freshens during dissociation activities (higher void ratio, as indicated by Eq. (1)). Though consistent, these liquid limit differences are generally well below 10%, suggesting pore water salinity changes may not be the controlling factor for compressibility.\nLiquid limit results shown parenthetically in Table 6 represent tests run on material that was used for a consolidation test prior to the liquid limit test. Samples UBGH2-3C 7P, 15P, and UBGH2-11B 16P show that LL\n\nDW\n after consolidation is less than the initial LL\n\nDW\n. This is a reminder that oven-drying (particularly at temperatures exceeding the 60\u00a0\u00b0C used in this study) can cause the sediment particles to aggregate, reducing LL, but also a reminder that increasing effective stress by even just a few MPa during the consolidation process can lower the resulting LL by crushing sediment components containing internal porosity, such as diatoms or other microfossils (Day, 1995; Shiwakoti et al., 2002).\n\n\n5.4\n1D consolidation: compressibility\nThe primary measurement goals of this study are to establish the extent to which pore water salinity and diatoms control sediment compressibility and permeability so we can better constrain the sediment response to hydrate-related production activities at the selected Ulleung Basin sites. Table 8\n and Fig. 7\n show the consolidation test results. Table 8 provides the compression index (Cc), swelling index (Cs), and recompression index (Cr).\nAn important salinity consideration is that the tested samples are remolded, but still contain at least a portion of their in situ ions. As noted in the Methods section, the reservoir fluid in the consolidometer was initially DW, 0.6\u00a0m brine, or 2\u00a0m brine, then replaced with DW or 2\u00a0m brine after the initial loading and determination of C\n\nc\n and C\n\ns\n as shown in Table 8. Reservoir fluid replacement is a proxy for testing the effects of reservoir salinity changing over time, but as the series of three tests on UBGH2-2-2B 11H-4 show, salinity does not correlate with the compression indices. This result can be anticipated from the sedimentation results, in which even the small amount of pre-existing salt (DWS specimens) causes the tested sediments to behave as if they are in contact with brine. We therefore average the UBGH2-2-2B 11H-4 tests results and disregard the initial reservoir fluid type for the other samples when plotting the dependence of compressibility on various parameters. We take the compressibility results in this study as representative of the sediment in the presence of brine.\nRepresentative correlations between index properties and the compressibility index, C\n\nc\n, are given in Table 4. Comparisons between measured and predicted C\n\nc\n values are plotted in Fig. 8\n. For C\n\nc\n\u00a0<\u00a00.45, the correlations are generally consistent with the measured results. In this lower C\n\nc\n range, we would recommend the void ratio correlation, which accounts for both the liquid limit and specific gravity of the soil. The correlations are empirical relationships that were not specifically developed for diatom-rich sediment, and as shown in Fig. 8, they significantly overpredict the measured results if C\n\nc\n exceeds \u223c0.45. These correlations are meant for remolded clays in general, but the specific compositions of these UBGH2 samples contain high enough diatom concentrations to alter the expected compressibility.\nSediment compressibility depends on both the sediment constituents, and on how those constituents are arranged. Here, since we work with remoulded specimens, we assume the sediment components are distributed homogeneously and focus on the contribution from each sediment component. Specifically, we are interested in whether any component appears to provide a significant control on the overall sediment compressibility. Fig. 9\n relates compressibility to the primary sediment constituents. Below C\n\nc\n\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.45, there are clear trends between the sediment content and compressibility. The open symbols track low compressibility components (C\n\nc,component\n\u00a0<\u00a0C\n\nc,sample\n). If any of these components were the primary control on compressibility, we would expect C\n\nc\n to fall as the component fraction increased, but we observe the reverse. The filled circles are primarily for mica, C\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00.86 in brine, though XRD results for mica will also contain a contribution from illite, C\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00.35 (compressibilities from Jang et al. (2018)). Given the high compressibility for mica, we would anticipate C\n\nc\n should decrease as the mica content falls, but again we observe the reverse. Note that if the illite contribution to the mica\u00a0+\u00a0illite component is significant, the general trend for mica\u00a0+\u00a0illite would be consistent with some illite control on the overall compressibility. Diatoms (red stars in Fig. 9) are both highly compressible (C\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00.54 in brine, Jang et al. (2018)) and the overall sample compressibility increases with increasing diatom content. It is unclear why the apparent diatom content for C\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00.45 (UBGH2-3C 7P) is so low, but overall, diatoms are the primary constituent (volume fraction exceeding 5%) for which the overall compressibility trend with composition responds as anticipated given the constituent compressibility.\nThe swelling index, C\n\ns\n, and recompression index, C\n\nr\n, values do not change significantly when the reservoir fluid is changed between the first and second consolidation cycles. Taken together, our results suggest the compressibility of the remolded samples is dependent on the particle morphology and mineralogy, but the pore fluid chemistry barely affects the recompression and swelling of the samples after virgin compression.\n\n\n5.5\nPermeability\nThe coefficient of consolidation, c\n\nv\n, coefficient of volume compressibility, m\n\nv\n, effective stress, \u03c3, void ratio, e, porosity, n, hydraulic conductivity, K and permeability, k, are all available digitally (Jang et al., 2022a). Here we focus only on permeability, specifically how diatoms alter the dependence of permeability and porosity on effective stress (Fig. 10\n). Specimen UBGH2-2-2B 11H-4 was tested three times, each with a different pore-fluid chemistry profile (indicated in Table 8). There is no correlation between the permeability and the pore fluid chemistry, suggesting that as with the sedimentation and compressibility results, the existing salinity in the specimen causes the sediment to behave as if it is in contact with a brine. Full results for UBGH2-2-2B 11H-4 are given in Fig. 13b, but for clarity in comparing between sites, only the deionized water results are presented in Fig. 10.\nTo illustrate the role diatoms play in determining porosity and permeability, we compare the UBGH2 results with the consensus porosity and permeability measured via consolidation theory as well as direct fluid flow on a fine-grained seal sediment sample from above a gas hydrate reservoir offshore India at NGHP-02-08 (Dai et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2019a; Priest et al., 2019). The NGHP-02-08 specimen (star in Fig. 10) did not appear to have diatoms (Jang et al., 2019a), but did have a comparable grain size, d\n\n50\n\u00a0=\u00a07.9\u00a0\u03bcm, and an even higher specific surface, S\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a0278\u00a0m2\/g (Dai et al., 2019) than the UBGH2 specimens studied here. Given the NGHP02-08 grain characteristics (absence of diatoms, small grain size and high specific surface) the permeability at a given porosity could be expected to be lower than the diatom-rich specimens from UBGH2, but this is not what we observe.\nPorosity preservation due to diatoms for these remolded specimens is particularly evident for the highest diatom content sample (UBGH2-6B 18H-3, 44.6% diatom content), which was able to retain a porosity of 58% at the peak effective stress of 2.56\u00a0MPa. At this stress, the remaining specimens, with diatom contents ranging from 22 to 34% are all consistent with, or more porous than, the NGHP02-08 sample (Fig. 10a). The elevated UBGH2 porosity does not equate with elevated permeability, however. As shown in Fig. 10b, the diatom-free NGHP02-08 sediment permeability (0.02 mD at 2\u00a0MPa effective stress) is consistent with or higher than all of the measured UBGH2 permeabilities measured at \u223c2.5\u00a0MPa, and higher than all but UBGH2-6B 18H-3 results measured at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.1\u00a0MPa. Results shown in Fig. 10 indicate the presence of diatoms alone does not guarantee an elevated permeability, even when the diatom content is above \u223c45%. Though diatoms and diatom shards provide additional pore space thanks to their jagged, porous structures (Figs. 1 and 5), the low permeability results indicate connectivity between those pore spaces is restricted by narrow openings in the diatoms (e.g., Fig. 1b \u201cinner porosity\u201d) and\/or increased fluid pathway tortuosity through enmeshed, interlocking shards (e.g., Fig. 5e).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nTo better understand how our laboratory results apply to the in-situ environment, it is useful to summarize the conclusions from Shiwakoti et al. (2002), who specifically tested how remolding altered the properties of diatom-rich sediment. Two of their key conclusions are: 1) when mixed into the fine-grained host sediment (they used kaolin), diatom contents of 30% (by volume) are sufficient to significantly enhance both the compressibility (40% increase) and permeability (factor of 2 increase), and 2) the remolding process can break silica bonds that may have formed between diatoms in addition to breaking a fraction of the diatoms themselves. The resulting sediment void space reduction reduces the sediment's compressibility and permeability (Shiwakoti et al., 2002). Their results indicate that even though compressibility and permeability results reported here (diatom contents ranging from \u223c22 to 44% by volume, Table 7), are likely to be higher than if the sediment had been diatom-free, the results for undisturbed in situ material should be even higher than our observations and our compressibility and permeability results should be taken as lower bounds for the in situ properties.\n\n6.1\nProduction from layered gas hydrate systems (e.g., UBGH2-2, UBGH2-6)\nHere we look at how properties of the diatom-rich sediment studied here could impact the extraction of methane from hydrate via depressurization of hydrate-bearing sediment. Figs. 11 and 12\n\n display the logging-while-drilling (LWD)-based estimates of gas hydrate saturation at UBGH2-2-2B and UBGH2-6B. The highly variable hydrate saturation is indicative of the layered gas hydrate system composed of highly hydrate-saturated, generally coarse-grained layers separated by finer-grained interbed layers. The hydrate-bearing layers are more vertically-distributed at UBGH2-2-2B than UBGH2-6B, but conceptually they offer similar environments in which to examine the significance of diatom-rich sediment on production performance. We use UBGH2-6B for our numerical examples, since it is a potential production test site (Ryu et al., 2013).\n\nBoswell et al. (2019) note that for hydrate reservoirs beneath water depths exceeding 2000\u00a0m (Table 1), significant pore-pressure drawdowns are required to destabilize gas hydrate and liberate the methane. To establish the minimum pressure drawdown that would destabilize gas hydrate, we need to know the in situ hydrostatic pressure as well as the hydrate stability pressure at the in situ temperature. The in situ hydrostatic pressure, P\n\nhydro\n, is given by:\n\n[6]\n\n\n\nP\n\nh\ny\nd\nr\no\n\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\n\ns\ne\na\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\n\n\n\u00b7\ng\n\u00b7\n\n(\n\nw\na\nt\ne\nr\n\nd\ne\np\nt\nh\n+\nd\ne\np\nt\nh\n\nb\ne\nl\no\nw\n\ns\ne\na\nf\nl\no\no\nr\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere we use a seawater density, \u03c1\n\nseawater\n\u00a0=\u00a01030\u00a0kg\/m3 and gravity, g\u00a0=\u00a09.8\u00a0m\/s2. For UBGH2-6B, the water depth is 2154.2\u00a0m (Table 1) and the primary gas hydrate-bearing sediment layers (Fig. 12) are between 140 and 155\u00a0m below seafloor (mbsf). Taking 150\u00a0mbsf as an example, the in situ hydrostatic pressure is 23.3\u00a0MPa.\nThe in situ reservoir temperature, T\n\nreservoir\n, is calculated from the geothermal gradient, 0.112\u00a0\u00b0C\/m, and bottom water temperature, 0.48\u00a0\u00b0C (Ryu et al., 2013), according to:\n\n[7]\n\n\n\nT\n\nr\ne\ns\ne\nr\nv\no\ni\nr\n\n\n=\n0.48\n\u00b0\nC\n+\n0.112\n\u00b0\nC\n\/\nm\n\u00b7\nd\ne\np\nt\nh\n\nb\ne\nl\no\nw\n\ns\ne\na\nf\nl\no\no\nr\n\n\n\nor 17.28\u00a0\u00b0C for UBGH2-6B at a reservoir depth of 150\u00a0mbsf. Using the hydrate stability curve provided by Tishchenko et al. (2005) for seawater with a typical 35 parts per thousand salinity, the reservoir's hydrostatic pressure must be reduced from the in situ value of 23.3\u00a0MPa to below 20.4\u00a0MPa for hydrate to destabilize. This \u223c3\u00a0MPa pore pressure decrease generates an additional 3\u00a0MPa effective stress on the sediment. Kim et al. (2013b) indicates the in situ effective stress is \u223c0.9\u00a0MPa for the UBGH2-6B gas hydrate reservoir, meaning an overall effective stress of at least \u223c4\u00a0MPa will be imposed during the depressurization process. A maximum anticipated effective stress during depressurization, 15\u00a0MPa, is suggested by Kim et al. (2017) in a review of reservoir parameters required for modeling production from UBGH2-6B.\n\nFigs. 11 and 12 compare the compressibility values measured here on remolded samples with the compressibility results from Kim et al. (2013b) and Lee et al. (2013a). The sample depths are given relative to the LWD profiles for UBGH2-2-2 and UBGH2-6. It can be difficult to know if data from a particular depth correspond to a coarse-grained reservoir or a fine-grained interbed layer, but all C\n\nc\n results plotted here are taken from the very fine-grained samples (d\n\n50\n\u00a0<\u00a012.5\u00a0\u03bcm) characteristic of interbeds or overlying seal material. For comparison, Bahk et al. (2013a) report the average grain size for the UBGH2 reservoir sands is 134\u00a0\u03bcm.\nAs anticipated from the work of Shiwakoti et al. (2002), compressibilities for the remolded specimens (red stars in Figs. 11 and 12) are lower bounds for the compressibility of undisturbed or minimally-disturbed sediment (open symbols in Figs. 11 and 12). In comparison to the fine-grained seal and interbed sediment tested here, the compressibility of the coarser reservoir sediment is low, measured by Kim et al. (2017) to be C\n\nc\n\u00a0=\u00a00.207. Table 8 and Fig. 8 show the diatoms present in UBGH2-2-2 and UBGH2-6 sediment contribute to measured sediment compressibilities that are \u223c70\u2013170% higher than the nominal reservoir compressibility, and based on the Shiwakoti et al. (2002) conclusions, this difference should be even greater when considering in situ, undisturbed sediment. This result is consistent with the properties of diatoms. Diatoms are highly compressible (Jang et al., 2018) because the diatoms themselves are easily crushed as effective stress increases above 200\u2013350\u00a0kPa, leading to dramatic porosity reductions (Shiwakoti et al., 2002). High compressibility sediments can be a liability during a depressurization-style production because the compressing or subsiding sediment imparts stress on the well casing itself, which can fail either in tension or in compression depending on how stress from the compacting sediment gets distributed along the well walls (Hancock et al., 2019).\nA second production liability diatoms can contribute to is in the permeability of sediments bounding the gas hydrate reservoir. Where diatom abundance is high enough to preserve elevated porosity and permeability in the seal sediment overlying a reservoir, such as in Area B offshore India (Jang et al., 2019b), reservoir depressurization becomes less efficient due to water migrating from the permeable \u201cseal\u201d sediment into the reservoir during depressurization (Jang et al., 2020b). Reservoir modeling by Ajayi et al. (2018) and Konno et al. (2019) demonstrate the importance of seal sediment permeability when modeling the reservoir production efficiency. As Ajayi et al. (2018) point out for a permafrost-associated gas hydrate reservoir on the Alaska north slope, the predicted production efficiency drops by a factor of two when considering a seal with 1mD-permeability rather than the idealized zero-permeability seal.\n\nFig. 10 indicates that even with the diatom contents observed in these UBGH2 specimens, the permeability is quite low. The results for UBGH2-2-2B and UBGH2-6B are consistent with the measurements of Kim et al. (2013b), which were also made via the Terzaghi et al. (1996) consolidation theory (Eq. (3)) (Fig. 13\n). Like the data measured here, Kim et al. (2013b) measured permeability as they increased the applied effective stress, so the points toward the lower left in each plot represent porosity and permeability at the highest applied effective stress (\u223c1.8\u00a0MPa). Kim et al. (2013b) note the in situ effective stress for UBGH2-6B is approximately 0.9\u00a0MPa, and three points from their study that are representative of in situ permeability at that effective stress for the overlying seal, OS, the interbedded fine-grained layers, IL, and underlying seal, US, are highlighted in Fig. 13b.\nTaking the data from both sites together, the in situ permeability is likely to be on the order of 0.01mD. Even the highest diatom-content specimen, UBGH2-6B 18H-3C (red circles in Fig. 13b), has a permeability of only \u223c0.04mD at an effective stress of 0.9\u00a0MPa. For comparison, the hydrate-free reservoir sediment has an intrinsic permeability of \u223c180mD (Kim et al., 2017), four orders of magnitude higher than that of the fine-grained sediment. In the presence of gas hydrate (S\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a065%), Kim et al. (2017) suggests the reservoir permeability will be \u223c3mD, which is still two orders of magnitude more than the expected in situ permeability in the fine-grained seals and interbeds.\nEven at their in situ, undisturbed permeabilities, the seal and interbed sediments are likely to behave as effective seal sediments for production. Compaction during production will further decrease the porosity and permeability in these compressible fine-grained layers, particularly if pressure drawdowns of 15\u00a0MPa are applied as suggested by Kim et al. (2017). Such an increase is approximately eight times the maximum effective stress applied to get the data points shown in Fig. 13, so permeabilities in the fine-grained sediments could decrease to the order of microdarcies during production. In spite of the observed diatom content in the fine-grained seal and interbed sediments, these sediments appear to be able to provide effective seals during production. Based on sedimentation and liquid limit results showing the sediment's sensitivity to even low salinity, we do not believe the compressibility and permeability response to depressurization will change as the pore water freshens due to gas hydrate dissociation during production.\nEven if the seals and interbed are effective at limiting fluid flow into the reservoir sediment during production, the presence of diatoms in the fine-grained layers could present a challenge to the long-term permeability of the reservoir itself. Thinly-layered gas hydrate reservoirs subjected to depressurization likely have preferential hydrate dissociation at the interfaces between reservoir layers and the fine-grained interbed or bounding seal sediments due to the fine-grained layer's capacity to provide heat to sustain the endothermic dissociation of gas hydrate (Myshakin et al., 2019). The sediment motion modeling by Uchida et al. (2019) demonstrates how this preferential gas hydrate dissociation can mobilize sands from the interfaces between reservoir and interbed\/seal sediment, entraining sand particles in the fluid flow toward the production well. Oyama et al. (2016) show that the fluid flow rates required to mobilize fine-grained particles are an order of magnitude smaller than what is required to mobilize the coarse grains, meaning the preferential hydrate dissociation will likely erode the fine-grained layers, drawing fine-grained particles into the fluid flow toward the well. Jang et al. (2020a) point out that diatoms and diatom fragments in UBGH2 sediments are particularly prone to clogging pore throats, especially in systems with mixed gas and fluid flow in which the fluid\/gas meniscus concentrates the fine-grained particles entrained in the flow (Cao et al., 2019). Permeability reduction due to reservoir pore-throat clogging at or near the well bore reduces the overall well production efficiency and will be exacerbated by diatoms detached from the interbed and seal layers.\n\n\n6.2\nProduction from chimney gas hydrate systems (e.g., UBGH2-3, UBGH2-11)\nSites UBGH2-3 and UBGH2-11 are representative of fine-grained chimney environments. Chimney structures have long been viewed as conduits for enhanced fluid and gas flow, promoting gas hydrate growth by supplying methane-rich fluid (or gas) into the hydrate stability zone (e.g., Anderson and Bryant, 1990; Hyndman and Davis, 1992). As shown in Fig. 3, these chimneys can have massive gas hydrate near the seafloor above a deeper network of gas hydrate filled lenses, and diatoms can act to promote the formation of these hydrate morphologies. As noted previously, diatoms can provide pore spaces that are larger than in the surrounding fine-grained sediment, allowing hydrate to form at lower pore-water methane concentrations than is possible in small pores (Kraemer et al., 2000). Once formed, gas hydrate can then grow beyond the limits of the diatom-rich layer and into the surrounding fine-grained sediment via fracture formation and fill (Daigle and Dugan, 2010; Oti et al., 2019). Near the seafloor, hydrate growth in chimneys can even generate massive, nearly sediment-free gas hydrate (see imagery from UBGH2-7 in Ryu et al., 2013; offshore western Japan in Matsumoto et al., 2017; Yoneda et al., 2019a; and from the South China Sea in Ye et al., 2019).\nThe resource potential of near-seafloor, massive gas hydrate is not yet well understood (Matsumoto et al., 2017), and currently the most economically-viable gas hydrate morphology to target is thought to be gas hydrate in coarse-grained sediments that can be destabilized via depressurization (e.g., Yamamoto et al., 2017). Depressurization is not considered a viable option for recovering methane from predominantly fine-grained environments due to low initial permeability of the host sediments (Moridis and Sloan, 2007; Jang and Santamarina, 2016b). Boswell and Collett (2011) note the vast majority of gas hydrate is hosted in fine-grained sediment, however, and Zhang et al. (2020) suggest certain fine-grained environments, such as chimney structures with porosity preservation due to skeletal fragments in the sediment, may have enough fluid flow and available pore space to merit assessment as hydrate-based energy resources. Here we discuss the implications of diatoms on three proposed production strategies: horizontal wells, direct removal of the hydrate and host sediment, and extraction of methane in the hydrate via replacement in the hydrate structure by carbon dioxide, CO2.\n\nMao et al. (2021) show horizontal wells can improve resource extraction efficiency, in part by increasing the area over which the well contacts a hydrate-rich layer. For chimney environments, however, gas hydrate tends to occur in isolated sand bodies of limited spatial extent as noted for site UBGH2-11 (Lee et al., 2013b) or as grain-displacing, hydrate-filled veins at both UBGH2-3 (Lee and Collett, 2013; Lee et al., 2013b) and UBGH 2-11 (Lee et al., 2013b). The limited spatial extent of these hydrate-rich bodies reduces the contact area horizontal wells can attain with hydrate, but horizontal wells, or multiple angled wells, do have the potential to contact many hydrate-filled veins and more effectively extract methane from fine-grained sediment (Ning et al., 2022).\nOne approach that capitalizes on a well that contacts many hydrate-filled veins is the fluidization approach. In fine-grained sediment offshore China, Liu et al. (2019) report on the effectiveness of fluidizing the hydrate and sediment around the well, then pumping both the hydrate and sediment to the surface for separation and processing. High diatom concentrations in the UBGH2 environments can further benefit the fluidization process by lowering the sediment density, thereby lowering the demand on the pumps (e.g., Table 7: diatom concentrations between 22 and 34%; Table 6: G\n\ns\n\u00a0<\u00a02.66 for UBGH2-3 and UBGH2-11).\nFluidization destroys the mechanical integrity of the reservoir, which may not be acceptable in all situations. To preserve the reservoir's mechanical stability, methane extraction via direct replacement of methane by carbon dioxide (CO2) in the hydrate has been proposed. Theoretical (Dornan et al., 2007) and laboratory (Park et al., 2006) results show it is energetically favorable for CO2 (and a carrier gas such as nitrogen) to replace methane in the hydrate structure. This replacement process happens spontaneously, though high replacement rates strongly depend on large interfacial contact areas between the invading CO2 and the original methane hydrate (Schicks et al., 2011). This spontaneous replacement process was demonstrated in the Ignik Sikumi coarse-grained gas hydrate reservoir (Schoderbeck et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2014; Schicks et al., 2018), and has been proposed for use on thin gas hydrate occurrences in fine-grained sediment (Jang and Santamarina, 2016b; Li et al., 2018).Where the presence of diatoms increases the permeability of undisturbed fine-grained host sediment, diatoms would benefit initial efforts to disperse CO2 (likely with nitrogen as a carrier gas as was done at Ignik Sikumi (Anderson et al., 2014; Schicks et al., 2018)). Recovering methane released as the hydrate takes on CO2 requires drawing fluid and gas into the production well, however. As described in Section 6.1, diatoms can be dislodged from the fine-grained host sediment, entrained in the production flow, and promote clogging at and near the production well, even for low diatom concentrations in the entrained flow (Cao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020a). Diatom entrainment and clogging is exacerbated by the reservoir geometry. The thin hydrate occurrences and the concentration of CO2 replacement along the hydrate interfaces with the host sediment (Li et al., 2018) creates a similar arrangement as described in Section 6.1: methane and fluid flow back to the production well will be focused along the hydrate\/sediment interfaces, increasing the fluid flow rate along these interfaces (Uchida et al., 2019), thus boosting the likelihood of entraining diatoms in the flow. Moreover, as methane bubbles move to the production well, the mobile gas\/fluid menisci are particularly effective at entraining fines, including diatoms, concentrating the fines and promoting clogging (Cao et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2020a).\n\n\n6.3\nConventional hydrocarbon production from beneath chimney gas hydrate systems (e.g., UBGH2-3)\nSite UBGH2-3 is associated with the nearby Donghae-1 commercial gas field (Ryu et al., 2013), so there is the potential for extracting conventional hydrocarbons underlying the UBGH2-3 hydrate or from beneath similar chimney structures elsewhere in the Donghae-1 field. As reviewed in Beaudoin et al. (2014), a critical aspect of such production is the impact of transporting high-temperature fluid and gas up through overlying gas hydrate-bearing sediment.\n\nHadley et al. (2008) calculated that enough heat would be released into overlying, hydrate-bearing sediment from a conventional production well over its 30-year lifespan to dissociate gas hydrate 20\u201350\u00a0m away from the well. Their location, the Gumusut-Kakap field offshore Malaysia, was found via pressure coring to have primarily hydrate-filled veins in fine-grained sediment, similar to the hydrate morphology at UBGH2-3. When heated above its stability temperature, the gas hydrate will break down, releasing gas. Jang and Santamarina (2016b) show that at 10\u00a0MPa (\u223c1000\u00a0m below sea level, which for UBGH2-3 would be \u223c100\u00a0mbsf), dissociation should cause a volume expansion of a factor of 2.4 as the hydrate reverts to water and gas at the stability temperature. This expansion factor increases as the in situ pressure decreases toward the seafloor and as the system warms further above the stability temperature due to heat from conventional hydrocarbons being pumped up from underlying sediment. Though diatoms increase the host sediment permeability relative to diatom-free sediment, the pore-throats in the fine-grained UBGH2-3 sediment are still too small to be conducive to gas entry, and the elevated gas pressure will fracture sediment around the hydrate-filled veins (Daigle et al., 2020; Jain and Juanes, 2009; Shin and Santamarina, 2011; Jang and Santamarina, 2016b).\n\nShiwakoti et al. (2002) note how cemented bonds can form between diatoms in situ. Such bonds will help the host sediment resist fracturing by increasing the tensile strength of the host sediment, but this is not likely to prevent sediment fracturing at an environment like UBGH2-3 because of the high overpressures that could develop. For example, Briaud and Chaouch (1997), in their modeling of hydrate dissociation around a conventional production well, note the production fluids are much warmer than the overlying hydrate-bearing sediment. They assume 100\u00a0\u00b0C fluids are pumped up the production well, but hydrate at the \u223c10\u00a0MPa pore pressure for UBGH2-3 will break down if the temperature exceeds 11.5\u00a0\u00b0C (using the hydrate\/seawater stability curve from Tishchenko et al., 2005). Even just an additional 6\u00a0\u00b0C temperature increase can generate an 11\u00a0MPa pressure increase (Tishchenko et al., 2005). Shiwakoti et al. (2002) present SEM imagery indicating extensive diatom crushing occurs when diatoms are subjected to 10\u00a0MPa loads, and as noted above, Shiwakoti et al. (2002) measure a dramatic increase in sediment compressibility when diatom-rich sediment is subjected to even 200\u00a0kPa loads. The significant pressure increase that can occur during hydrate dissociation via warming for a site such as UBGH2-3 can be expected to fracture the host sediment even in the presence of high diatom concentrations (22\u201334% by volume at UBGH2-3, Table 7).\n\nHadley et al. (2008) consider the potential for these depressurization-induced fractures to reach the seafloor to allow direct methane escape to the water column. The gas-generated fractures can buckle the well itself, via stress transfer to the well or by causing sediment subsidence around the well (Hadley et al., 2008). Gas can also migrate to the well and then up the well casing to the surface (Collett and Dallimore, 2002; Beaudoin et al., 2014). In total, the hydrate-related risks to conventional hydrocarbon production at the Gumusut-Kakap field were considered high enough that the well site location and clustered well approach were both changed to reduce exposure to the hydrate-bearing sediment (Hadley et al., 2008). For UBGH2-3, the presence of diatoms does not appear to provide a sufficient sediment strength increase to merit locating a conventional hydrocarbon well in the chimney feature's vicinity.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWhether gas hydrate or underlying conventional hydrocarbons can be economically recovered as an energy resource depends, in part, on the properties of sediment associated with the gas hydrate. A common feature of the recovered sediment associated with gas hydrate from the four UBGH2 sites tested here is the presence of diatoms, which exist in large enough concentrations to alter the overall sediment properties.\nDiatoms are typically considered to increase both sediment compressibility and permeability, but in our study, the diatom influence was easier to observe in sediment compressibility than in permeability. Whereas the compressibility scaled with increasing diatom content, a permeability shift to higher values was only apparent for the highest diatom content (\u223c45%). Even accounting for the high diatom-content specimen, the in situ permeability for these fine-grained sediments is likely to be on the order of 0.01mD, which is slightly lower than the 0.02 mD permeability measured for diatom-free sediment of a very similar grain size from offshore India (Jang et al., 2019a).\nImplications for extracting methane from gas hydrate hosted in thinly-layered, coarse-grained sediment interbedded with, and bound by, the fine-grained sediment tested here (e.g., UBGH2-2-2B, UBGH2-6) are that any well design will need to account for interbeds and bounding seal sediment that is 70\u2013170% more compressible than the reservoir sediment itself. If the well can sustain the sediment compaction as the reservoir pressure is drawn down, the interbeds and seal sediment should provide initially effective barriers to fluid flow because they are two orders of magnitude less permeable than the anticipated permeability of the hydrate-bearing sediment itself. Moreover, the permeability reduction due to compaction could reduce the interbed and seal permeability another order of magnitude.\nThe low density and high surface area of diatoms make them susceptible to resuspension. Lighter, more easily suspended sediment would benefit fluidization or other production techniques that bring all sediment, fluid and hydrate to the surface, but when utilizing depressurization in conventional wells, preferential fluid and gas flow along the interfaces between the reservoir and interbed or seal sediment is likely to draw diatom-rich fines toward the well where they could clog pore throats and reduce production efficiency.\nWhen attempting to draw relatively warm conventional hydrocarbons up through a well that penetrates hydrate-bearing sediment in these deep-water systems (e.g., UBGH2-3), the potential bonding between diatoms will not likely provide enough sediment strength increase to withstand the pore pressure increase as gas hydrate dissociates via heating around the conventional well. The low measured permeability, even in the presence of diatoms, will exacerbate any pressure increase during dissociation by limiting the extent to which fluid can flow away from the dissociation fronts.\nOverall, diatoms in undisturbed sediment have the capacity to increase sediment strength due to diatom-diatom bonding, and the presence of diatoms can increase permeability and porosity, but at the water depths characteristic of these UBGH2 sites, methane or hydrocarbon extraction is anticipated to impose effective stress increases of 3\u201315\u00a0MPa that will significantly disturb the diatom-rich sediment. Our measurements suggest we can anticipate that the mechanical behavior of the fine-grained UBGH2 sediment at the four sites in this study will be dominated by the diatom behavior in disturbed sediment. We anticipate the sediment to be compressible and low-permeability, and that these properties will not be significantly influenced by any pore-water freshening that occurs as a result of hydrate dissociation.\n\n","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nWhile current world energy demand increases daily, hydrocarbon reservoir discovery rate is on a declining trend, promoting the evaluation of new approaches focused on locating undiscovered reservoir resources. Although the strategy to meet global energy demands will require diversifying energy sources to harmonize environmental expectations (e.g., Vargas et al., 2022), hydrocarbons will be the keystone in the framework of an orderly transition (Thompson, 2022). Hence, we employ in this work the \u201cGolden Zone\u201d theory, introduced by Buller et al. (2005), to identify potential areas where significant hydrocarbon resources have not yet been found. It is an empirically verifiable theory showing that hydrocarbons in siliciclastic sedimentary basins generally occur predictably as a function of temperature.\nAccording to Buller et al. (2005), the theory is based on the analysis of data from the Norwegian continental shelf, including the volume of approximately 120,000 proven oil and gas accumulations, demonstrating after years of studying that at a certain depth, the main controlling force behind the diagenetic reduction of porosity and permeability is temperature, not the effective stress. Based on the empirical theory, the world's siliciclastic basins can be modeled using an idealized thermal zonation scheme in which about 90% of the world's oil and gas resources are found between 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms (Fig. 1\nC). These authors suggest that hydrocarbons may occur outside the accumulation zone due to local conditions, such as an upward migration from the underlying accumulation zone through laterally extensive sandstones and siltstone carrier beds.\n\nBuller et al. (2005) established that the entrapment of oil and gas depends on three geological components: a petroleum charge system, high-quality reservoir rocks, and an effective seal. The petroleum charge system consists of organic-rich source rocks, which are exposed to elevated temperatures and capable of generating hydrocarbons; the oil and gas window generation start at about 110\u00a0\u00b0C and 140\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Buller et al., 2005). The hydrocarbons generated migrate from the source rocks to the overlying sediment column, where some may be accumulated in reservoirs rocks. However, hydrocarbons preservation depends on the sealing capacity of overlying cap rock sequence. Some hydrocarbons may remigrate to reservoir rocks higher in the sedimentary succession due to the overlying caprock fracture. The commercial quantities of hydrocarbons can be found where present-day traps whose cap rocks are intact, with reservoir rocks sufficiently porous to contain hydrocarbons and permeable enough to flow towards production wells (Buller et al., 2005).\nAccording to Buller et al. (2005), the hydrocarbons distribution is controlled by heat, diagenesis, and fluid pressure. The heat is primarily derived from deep in the Earth's crust and flows upwards through conductive sediment-filled basins. The pressure increases with depth but less noticeably, representing hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures, the limits between which the pressure of pore fluids in a sediment column varies typically. Initially, the pore pressure closely follows the hydrostatic boundary, but at a certain depth, which differs considerably from basin to basin, it moves towards the lithostatic limit (Fig. 1A). The diagenesis is controlled by pressure and heat, being the unconsolidated sediments converted with time and burial into sedimentary rocks through physical consolidation, compaction, and the chemical precipitation of new minerals.\nThe studies developed on the Norwegian continental shelf suggest that porosity and permeability loss are mechanically driven during early burial and thermo-chemically driven during deeper burial, being controlled by time\u2013temperature controlled reactions, which generate overpressure as porosity is reduced (Bj\u00f8rkum and Nadeau, 1998; Buller et al., 2005; Nadeau, 2011a, 2011b). At temperatures greater than 60\u00a0\u00b0C, internally sourced quartz cementation and diagenetic clay become important porosity and permeability reduction factors, respectively (Bj\u00f8rkum and Nadeau, 1998). Porosity loss due to quartz cementation in sandstones and siltstones proceeds mainly independent of effective stress, or fluid pressure and porosity loss rates approach those required to generate high fluid overpressures at approximately 120\u00a0\u00b0C, which can result in hydrofracturing of the overlaying low permeability shales (Bj\u00f8rkum and Nadeau, 1998). The volume of quartz cement precipitated, and therefore, the porosity loss at constant temperature decreases as a function of time due to the decrease in quartz surface area as cementation proceeds (Walderhaug, 1996). Hence, it seems clear that there is an overlapping between the Golden Zone and the window where the quartz cementation is reducing porosity. Nevertheless, both processes may coexist. Once hydrocarbons migrate to other regions, the porosity reduction due to quartz cementation becomes the most dominant process.\n\nBuller et al. (2005) and Nadeau (2011b) describe from the perspective of the Golden Zone the idealized model of fluid migration and hydrocarbon accumulation for sedimentary basins, which consists of three thermal zones (Fig. 1B):\n\na)\nCompaction zone <60\u00a0\u00b0C, or the sealing zone. Here, temperatures are below 60\u00a0\u00b0C, and hydrocarbon volumes are low because this area is largely beyond the influence of fracturing and remigration (Buller et al., 2005). It is inferred that hydraulic fractures disappear in the 60\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm because the permeability of shales is not low enough to propagate the fractures through the rock matrix. In this zone, the deformability of clay minerals is controlled by water availability. Thus, the water activity reduces the mechanical properties such as the brittleness (Fouch\u00e9 et al., 2004; Wen et al., 2015).\n\n\nb)\nAccumulation zone from 60\u00a0\u00b0C to 120\u00a0\u00b0C, also called \u201cThe Golden Zone\u201d. Most oil and gas accumulations are found here. Although there is no evidence of differentiation between the oil and gas positions in the Golden Zone, this empirical model satisfies global occurrences of hydrocarbons. In this zone, the porosity and permeability of sandstone deposits are relatively high because the volume of quartz cement fills only a portion of the available pore space (Buller et al., 2005). The precipitation of diagenetic clay minerals at temperatures >60\u00a0\u00b0C leads to very low permeability shales\/mudstones, creating an essential component in the geological containers which hold many giant petroleum accumulations. The precipitated diagenetic clay makes the sealing rock units much more effective at capturing and storing oil and gas expelled from organic-rich source rocks at higher temperatures, generally >120\u00a0\u00b0C (Nadeau, 2011b). It also helps preserve the oil, isolating it from bacterial and thermal degradation (Nadeau et al., 2005). This model for clay diagenesis is referred to as the \u2018Fundamental Particle\u2019 model (McHardy et al., 1982; Nadeau et al., 1984a, b).\n\n\nc)\nExpulsion zone from 120\u00a0\u00b0C to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, also called the high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) fluid expulsion zone. This encompasses mainly the hydrocarbon generation zone from source rocks and is characterized by low permeability and high pore pressures. A minor percentage of oil and gas is entrapped here (Buller et al., 2005).\n\n\n\nThe diagenetic processes in sedimentary basins with increasing depth and temperature have played a significant role in forming conventional oil and gas accumulations. Only 3% of the world's conventional oil and \u223c10% of the world's conventional gas reserves occur in reservoirs >120\u00a0\u00b0C (Nadeau, 2011b), and the shallow heavy oils accumulations, which typically occur in shallow reservoirs <60\u00a0\u00b0C, are largely associated with fill-spill hydrocarbon migration as described by Gussow (1954). Extra-heavy oils like those in the western Canada and eastern Venezuela have been associated with lateral fill-spill migration within foreland basin settings (Roadifer, 1987); most of this oil eluded entrapment within the optimal Golden Zone, partly due to the lack of lateral seals and effective confining faults at the basin scale (Nadeau et al., 2005, 2006). Those hydrocarbons located above the accumulation zone are vulnerable to bacterial degradation due to bacteria consume the lighter oil fractions (Buller et al., 2005).\nThe model described by Buller et al. (2005) is focused on sedimentary basins undergoing continuous subsidence and sedimentation throughout their geological history, producing continuous deposition and basin subsidence, and the sedimentary intervals progressively pass downwards through the various temperature zones as they become more deeply buried. Buller et al. (2005) explained that where the sedimentary basins are subjected to periods of tectonic inversion, there is uplift and erosion of significant sediment. In case of uplift or erosion, the thermally driven and fluid dynamic processes will be switched off partially because the sediments undergo cooling. If the former 60\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm has been moved to the surface, the accumulation zone will erode, and prospectivity decreases. If the former 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherm approaches the surface, few hydrocarbons will remain in the basin. When uplift or erosion occurs, the depths to potentially viable prospects decrease, thus reducing drilling costs, but there is a risk of biodegradation of those originally hot reservoirs.\nThe Golden Zone theory is also relevant for understanding the occurrence of overpressure and natural fracturing of formations and has implications for improving drilling practice (Nadeau, 2011a). Hurst (2011) studied the oil spill on the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d oil rig, which occurred in the Mississippi Submarine Canyon (Gulf of Mexico), by examining the geological characteristics that can be used to mitigate technical risk during exploration drilling. The Golden Zone concept was evaluated in the context of improving the understanding of overpressure encountered during drilling. Based on Hurst (2011), the temperature is identified as the critical control of the stability of minerals in mudstones and sandstones during their progressive burial. Once the burial temperature exceeds 60\u00a0\u00b0C, mechanical compaction becomes insignificant, and the mineralogical changes in mudstones occur time-dependent, causing rapid decreases in porosity and permeability. In sandstones, porosity loss is rapid above 120\u00a0\u00b0C when the quartz cement volume increases exponentially. Both processes make strata susceptible to high overpressure, which can lead to the development of hydraulic fractures. The Golden Zone concept encompasses the significance of the 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms on porosity, permeability, and pore pressure. This provides a scientifically robust foundation for understanding processes relevant to mitigating risk in hydrocarbon exploration. The severe problems experienced while drilling the Macondo 252 #1 well on the \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d oil rig occurred at slightly less than 120\u00a0\u00b0C, representing the temperature of the Golden Zone base.\nThe Golden Zone depth interval and thickness can be predicted by knowing the geothermal gradient. A geothermal gradient model can be estimated by combining the Curie Point Depth (CPD) with in-situ geothermal gradient data, largely estimated from temperature measurements for the well intervals, for a reliable and precise estimation of a global geothermal gradient map. CPD represents the base depth of the magnetic layer. According to the above, this paper's main objectives are to estimate a global geothermal gradient model integrating CPD data with in-situ geothermal gradient measurements. Secondly, define a global Golden Zone model of distribution and thickness using the global geothermal gradient previously created. The results will be analyzed and compared against the global oil and gas fields database reported by Horn (2005) and PETRADATA v 1.2 (Lujala et al., 2007).\n\n\n2\nMethodology and data\n\n2.1\nGlobal Curie Point Depth map estimation\nMapping the Curie isotherm can provide information on temperatures at depths not accessible by other means (Okubo et al., 1985; Pinz\u00f3n and Vargas, 2019, 2021), such as by estimating the geothermal gradient between the Earth's surface and the CPD associated with the Curie temperature. The CPD corresponds to the depth where magnetic minerals lose their magnetism and refers to the point when the Curie temperature is reached. In continental regions, it is approximately 580\u00a0\u00b0C (Beardsmore and Cull, 2001), varying from region to region, mainly depending on the regional geology, the geothermal flow, and the mineral content of the rocks.\nEstimating CPD is based on an inversion of magnetic data, applying a power radial spectrum of the magnetic anomalies analysis by windows. The Global magnetic anomaly data used corresponds to the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid EMAG2v3 (Meyer et al., 2017), compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). EMAG2v3 was developed from magnetic satellite, ship, and airborne measurements. The grid resolution is 3.71\u00a0km and includes about 50 million new data points added to the NCEI's Geophysical Database System (GEODAS) in recent years. According to Meyer et al. (2017), the new grid relies only on observed data. It does not use previous information on the geologic structure or ocean age, considering that it can force an artificial linear pattern to the grid. The data-only approach allows for greater complexity in representing the evolution along oceanic spreading ridges and continental margins, but regions of a sparse magnetic survey coverage do not provide a good image of large structures. Unfortunately, in the Southern Hemisphere, the data coverage is sparse, and there are wide gaps. EMAG2v3 grid data were interpolated into the non-data zones to obtain a regular worldwide grid to estimate a global Curie Point Depth map (Figure A1. Map of the EMAG2v3 grid interpolated is in Appendix A).\nThe Centroid Method introduced by Bhattacharyya and Leu (1975a, 1975b, 1977), and later modified by Okubo et al. (1985) and Tanaka et al. (1999), was used for the Curie Point Depth estimation. This method is based on examining the shape of isolated magnetic anomalies. It provides a relationship between the spectrum of magnetic anomalies and the depth of a magnetic source by transforming the spatial data into the frequency domain.\nFollowing Okubo et al. (1985), the depth to the top of the magnetic source (\n\n\nZ\nt\n\n\n) is estimated from the slope of a straight fitted line through the high wavenumber region of an azimuthally averaged Fourier spectrum using Eq. (1) (Fig. 2\n). Then, the depth of the centroid \n\n(\n\nZ\no\n\n\n) is given by the slope of a straight fitted line through the low wavenumber region of an azimuthally averaged frequency-scaled Fourier spectrum using Eq. (2) (Fig. 2).\n\n(1)\n\n\nl\nn\n\n\n[\n\n\u03a6\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n|\nn\n|\n)\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n]\n\n\n=\n\nB\n\n\u2212\n\n\nZ\nt\n\n|\nn\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nl\nn\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n|\nn\n|\n\n)\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n|\nn\n|\n\n\n]\n\n\n=\n\nl\nn\n\n\n[\nD\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\no\n|\nn\n|\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the CPD \n\n(\n\nZ\nb\n\n\n) is obtained from Eq.

The window size estimation was performed considering the suggestion of Okubo et al. (1985) by using a window size of 4\u20136 times the target depth and the premise that the main sources of magnetic anomalies are present in the crust and not in the mantle (Jaupart and Mareschal, 2015). Based on the above, the window sizes were estimated from the thickness of the Earth's crust at the center point of each window multiplied by 5. Thus, the window sizes ranged from 150\u00a0km to 340\u00a0km, and the step between windows was defined as 18.55\u00a0km for a window overlap greater than 80% and a smoother and continuous result. To define wavenumber intervals, several tests were carried out over established control regions where a previous CDP model was known (Vargas et al., 2015; Id\u00e1rraga-Garc\u00eda and Vargas, 2017; Li et al., 2017). The wavenumber intervals were chosen for the linear fitting of slopes required in the Centroid Method, resulting in CPD values consistent with previous estimations.\nFollowing Sierra (2015) the errors associated with the depths of the top (\n\n\nZ\nt\n\n\n) and centroid \n\n(\n\nZ\no\n\n\n) of the magnetic layer are calculated by subtracting the theoretical depth values estimated by the averaged power radial spectrum using Eqs. (1) and (2) from the depth values estimated from the slope of a straight fitted line through the corresponded interval of each spectrum (Fig. 2) (Eq. (6)). Then, the errors associated with the depths of the top (\n\n\nZ\nt\n\n\n) and centroid \n\n(\n\nZ\no\n\n\n) are calculated by the standard deviation of the estimated difference values between the depths estimated by the averaged power radial spectrum and the estimated from the slope of a straight fitted line as follows:\n\n(4)\n\n\nln\n\n[\n\nP\n\nr\ne\na\nl\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\nK\n1\n\n\u22c5\n\nZ\n\nr\ne\na\nl\n\n\n+\nc\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nln\n\n[\n\nP\n\nt\nh\ne\no\nr\ni\nc\na\nl\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\nK\n1\n\n\u22c5\n\nZ\n\nt\nh\ne\no\nr\ni\nc\na\nl\n\n\n+\nc\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nln\n\n[\n\nP\n\nr\ne\na\nl\n\n\n]\n\n\u2212\nln\n\n[\n\nP\n\nt\nh\ne\no\nr\ni\nc\na\nl\n\n\n]\n\n=\n\nK\n1\n\n\u22c5\n\u0394\nZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\n\u0394\nZ\n=\n\n\n\u0394\nL\nn\n\n(\nP\n)\n\n\n\nK\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the error associated with the CPD is estimated by the propagation of the previous errors.\n\n\n2.2\nGlobal geothermal gradient map estimation\nA global geothermal gradient map can be derived from the CPD map, relating the CPD with the Curie temperature. According to Nwobodo et al. (2018), in the absence of global and subsurface heat flow data, an empirical relationship of a one-dimensional heat conductive transport model based on Fourier's Law is used to estimate the geothermal gradient. Assuming that the direction of temperature variation is vertical and the temperature gradient \n\n\n(\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\u0394\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n is constant, then the Fourier's Law for heat transfer takes the form:\n\n(8)\n\n\nq\n=\n\u03bb\n\n\n[\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\u0394\nz\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nwhere q is the heat flow, and \u03bb is the coefficient of thermal conductivity.\nAdditionally, following Tanaka et al. (1999) and Okubo et al. (1985), the geothermal gradient \n\n\n(\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\u0394\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n can be estimated as follows:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\u0394\nz\n\n\n=\n\n\nT\n\nC\nu\nr\ni\ne\n\n\n\nZ\n\nC\nu\nr\ni\ne\n\n\n\n=\n\u2248\n\n\n580\n\n\u00b0\nC\n\n\nZ\n\nC\nu\nr\ni\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere ZCurie corresponds to CPD, Tcurie was defined as 580\u00a0\u00b0C, considering it is the Curie Temperature of magnetite, which is the most common magnetic mineral in igneous rocks (Stephenson, 1992). Despite the surface temperature variability, Tsurface was defined according to the analysis performed by Tanaka et al. (1999), which suggested that there are no heat sources or heat sinks between the Earth's surface and the CPD, the surface temperature is 0\u00a0\u00b0C and the geothermal gradient \n\n\n(\n\n\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\u0394\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n is constant. Assuming surface temperature as 0\u00a0\u00b0C is commonly used in geothermal gradient estimation studies derived from the CPD calculations (see, e.g., Nwankwo et al., 2011; Anakwuba and Chinwuko, 2015; Irumhe et al., 2019; Njeudjang et al., 2020; Odidi et al., 2020; Yana et al., 2021). Even if the mean annual surface temperature had been used to calculate the geothermal gradient, the delta temperature \n\n(\n\u0394\nT\n)\n\n between the surface and CPD is divided by the delta depth \n\n(\n\u0394\nz\n)\n\n respective, resulting in a uniform decrease in the estimated geothermal gradient, with no changes in the trends shown by the global model.\nThe geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD was developed using a window size of 50\u00a0km2, being derived by Eq. (9) and affected by the error associated with the CPD. It is not a reliable resolution map, but constitutes an intermediate step for the final version of the global geothermal gradient map. Hence, the CPD estimation becomes an auxiliary variable to guide the interpolation of the compiled global database to get a calibrated global geothermal gradient map.\nThe global geothermal gradient database compiled comprises data from the Global Heat Flow Database of the International Heat Flow Commission (IHFC) version 2018\/12 (International Heat Flow Commission, 2019). We also incorporated the geothermal gradient data based on temperatures measurements at multiple depths in wells from Brazil (reported by Hamza et al., 2018, and provided by F. Pinto of The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation - MTCI); the reported dataset from Argentina by Sigismondi and Ramos (2008); the observations of Colombia provided by National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH); and the dataset from the United States, reported by SMU Node of National Geothermal Data System (http:\/\/geothermal.smu.edu\/static\/DownloadFilesButtonPage.htm?) managed by the SMU Geothermal Lab. The data collected were revised and edited to generate a global geothermal gradient map (Fig. 3\n).\nThe global geothermal gradient database was integrated into the previous geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD through geostatistical interpolation with a cell size of 50\u00a0km2 using the Collocated Cokriging, which is a multivariate version of Kriging, where the interpolation is done considering two co-regionalized variables; the primary variable \n\nZ\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n, and the secondary variable \n\nY\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n, where \n\nu\n\n refers to locations in a stationary domain. Then, the primary variable \n\nZ\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n is sampled at n locations, and the secondary variable \n\nY\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n is measured at all locations within the domain and is used to inform the prediction of \n\nZ\n(\nu\n\n) (Samson and Deutsch, 2020). The Collocated Cokriging uses the auxiliary variable at the current point where the target variable is estimated (Rivoirard, 2001), which is helpful when primary data are present in sparsely distributed points while secondary data are located in all points of the grid being estimated. In this case, the option for Collocated Cokriging is an attempt to avoid matrix instability by applying ordinary Cokriging (Rocha et al., 2012). The primary variable corresponds to the geothermal gradient, represented by a global database that contains 74,504 observations distributed worldwide (Fig. 3). The secondary variable corresponds to the global geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD, which has values worldwide. This map is considered a more reliable global geothermal gradient map and will be used for the Golden Zone estimations.\n\n\n2.3\nGlobal estimation of the Golden Zone thickness\nThe global Golden Zone presence map estimation requires global maps of geothermal gradient and sedimentary thickness. The depths for the top and base of the Golden Zone were calculated from the geothermal gradient map estimated by Collocated Cokriging. The sedimentary layer base depth map (Fig. 4\n) was estimated using sediment thickness data from the CRUST 1.0 model (Lake et al., 2013) for continental regions and GloSed (Straume et al., 2019) for oceanic and marginal seas regions; additional data used include information from reports for oil fields of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Eastern United States (Witt, 1993; Ridgley et al., 1994; Dolton, 1989 and Charpentier, 1988), and sedimentary thicknesses estimated for Colombia, reported by Mercado and Vargas (2015).\nThe Golden Zone estimates were performed globally, identifying mainly the most extensive geological patterns. Also, the one-dimensional heat conductive transport model used for geothermal gradient estimation by CPD, based on Fourier's Law described in Nwobodo et al. (2018), is considered a base for assuming the vertical temperature variation and the geothermal gradient. The Golden Zone presence map is developed considering the lateral geothermal gradient variation maintained constant in the vertical direction, depth values are positive and increase downwards.\nThree scenarios were defined for the global Golden Zone presence map (Fig. 1D). The conditions and calculations for each zone are specified below:\n\n\u25cf\nZone 0: the entire layer between 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms is outside the sedimentary layer. There is no Golden Zone.\n\n\n\n\nGolden Zone Top Depth\u00a0>\u00a0Sedimentary Layer base Depth.\n\n\u25cf\nZone 1: A part of the layer between 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms is located inside the sedimentary layer. The Golden Zone is partially present.\n\n\n\n\nGolden Zone Top Depth\u00a0<\u00a0Sedimentary Layer base Depth.\n\nGolden Zone Base Depth\u00a0>\u00a0Sedimentary Layer base Depth.\n\nThe top, base, and thickness maps were calculated with a window size of 50\u00a0km2\n, using the equations as follows:\n\n\nGolden Zone Top Depth = 60\u00a0\u00b0C\/Geothermal Gradient.\n\nGolden Zone Base Depth = Sedimentary Layer base Depth.\n\nGolden Zone Thickness = Sedimentary Layer base Depth - Golden Zone Top Depth.\n\n\u25cf\nZone 2: The entire layer between 60\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0\u00b0C isotherms is located inside the sediment thickness layer. The Golden Zone is presented with maximum thickness.\n\n\n\n\nGolden Zone Base Depth\u00a0<\u00a0Sedimentary Layer base Depth.\n\nThe maps of top, base, and thickness were calculated as follows:\n\n\nGolden Zone Top Depth = 60\u00a0\u00b0C\/Geothermal Gradient.\n\nGolden Zone Base Depth = 120\u00a0\u00b0C\/Geothermal Gradient.\n\nGolden Zone Thickness = Golden Zone Base Depth - Golden Zone Top Depth.\nThe Golden Zone presence maps are restricted by the minimum values of thickness and depth reported in the bibliography for oil or gas fields. The minimum for top depth was set at 150\u00a0m, based on Al-Ibrahim et al. (2015) work, where the challenges of drilling wells for heavy oil in shallow reservoirs located between 152 and 304\u00a0m depth from the surface are reported. Although, oil fields have been reported as shallow as 150\u00a0m, due to a progressive reduction in pore throats in most seal lithologies caused by compaction and diagenesis during burial, and that interfacial tension of the hydrocarbon changes with depth, affecting seal capacity (Grant, 1999; Dutta et al., 2021), the seal capacity should be evaluated for preventing the fluid migration at such shallow depths. The minimum thickness was set at 5\u00a0m, based on the Vo et al. (2001) study where ultra-thin reservoirs with less than 6\u00a0m of thickness were reported. Therefore, where the estimated Golden Zone is located at a depth from the surface less than 150\u00a0m or thickness is less than 5\u00a0m, it is considered there is no Golden Zone assigning zone 0. Then, the percentage of giant oil and\/or gas fields (defined giant fields as the ones containing at least 500 million bbl of ultimately recoverable oil or gas equivalent) located inside the Golden Zone regions and the volume of hydrocarbons comprised by them were calculated; using the estimated global Golden Zone presence map and data of 902 oil fields included in the giant oil and gas fields dataset reported by Horn (2005).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nGlobal CPD map\nCPD values range from 10\u00a0km to 50\u00a0km. Oceanic region values are shallower than the continent (Fig. 5\n). In the oceanic region, CPD values are shallower along the East Pacific Rise, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge, showing values close to 10\u00a0km along their spreading axes, which are well defined; in the other mid-ocean ridges, their spreading axes traces are not clear, but their CPD values are close to 30\u00a0km. These results are associated with the magmatic and tectonic activity in the oceanic regions, where the crustal thickness increases with distance from the ridge. In the continental area, where the shields are most noticeably, the CPD values are greater than 35\u00a0km for the shields in South America, Central and North Africa, and India. These high CPD values are associated with volcanic activity or hot spots that alter the geothermal gradient. The shields in North America, southeast Africa, western Australia, and Siberia show CPD values of less than 25\u00a0km. The CPD map differences result from the main geotectonic feature resolution for the southern and northern hemispheres associated with the EMAG2v3 dataset input conditions.\nThe percentage of errors related to the CPD estimation ranges between 2% and 25% (Fig. 6\n). In most of the regions, the percentage error is under 5%. The average error value is lower than in the continental region in the oceanic areas. The highest error value is present in the continental region, reaching 20%.\n\n\n3.2\nGlobal geothermal gradient map\nThe global geothermal gradient map, estimated by CPD, has values ranging from 10\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 40\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Fig. 7\n). The oceanic region presents geothermal gradient map values higher than the continental region. In the continental area, the shields and continental shelf are well delimited. In the oceanic region, the mid-ocean ridges show higher geothermal gradient values associated with the tectonic and magmatic activity typical of these geotectonic environments. This map shows a global model that does not reflect local temperature variations correctly and exhibits the same trends as the CPD map.\nThe global geothermal gradient map estimated by the interpolation has values ranging from 10\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 90\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Fig. 8\n). The boundaries between the continental and oceanic regions are well-defined. The oceanic region presents geothermal gradient values higher relative to the continental area. The mid-ocean ridges show geothermal gradient values close to 80\u00a0\u00b0C\/km along their stripes in the oceanic region. The shields are well delimited in the continental area, exhibiting geothermal gradients values typically below 20\u00a0\u00b0C\/km. This map reflects more regional trends, showing a global geothermal gradient model better adjusted to real temperature data. Therefore, it is used for Golden Zone depth map estimations.\nA geothermal gradient differences map was created to compare the maps developed by interpolation and CPD (Fig. 9\n). This map shows the main geological features worldwide, which were not well delimited in the geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD, and which are better resolved by the map estimated by the interpolation, getting a global model of temperature variations adjusted to real data. The significant differences between the geothermal gradient maps are shown in the oceanic region over the main mid-ocean ridges, where the difference reaches 80\u00a0\u00b0C\/km. The difference ranges from 40\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C\/km in the continental region.\nBased on the compiled global geothermal gradient database (Fig. 3), the mean of the continental and oceanic regions is 28\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and 52\u00a0\u00b0C\/km, respectively. In contrast, the global geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD presents a lower mean for the continental and oceanic regions of 18\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and 20\u00a0\u00b0C\/km, respectively, because it lacks calibration with real temperature data. On the other side, the global geothermal gradient map estimated by interpolation presents a mean for the continental and oceanic regions of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and 52\u00a0\u00b0C\/km, respectively, more adjusted to the global database values.\nA global geothermal gradient map estimated by interpolation using a single variable would show well-constrained local temperature variations and regional trends in areas of high data density. Meanwhile, the precision would decreases in regions with sparse data or strong dispersion of values in the vicinity. For the above reason, the global geothermal gradient map estimation was performed by integrating a compiled global database with the global CPD map by a geostatistical interpolation method that allows better control of the interpolation in areas with a low density of data by incorporating secondary information, which leads to better results than interpolation using a single variable.\n\n\n3.3\nGlobal Golden Zone distribution\nThe Golden Zone presence map has discrete values of 1 or 2, depending on the scenario explained in the methodology. Seventy-seven percent of giant oil and\/or gas fields reported in the Horn (2005) database are located inside regions with a Golden Zone presence (Fig. 10\n). The Golden Zone presence map correlates to the giant oil and\/or gas field locations in areas with a high density of measurements in the global geothermal gradient database. To the contrary, the uncertainty grows in areas with a low density of measurements. Therefore, the remaining oil and\/or gas fields outside Golden Zone areas should be associated with local temperature variations not reflected in the estimated global geothermal gradient map. The 77% of giant oil and\/or gas fields previously defined as being inside of regions with Golden Zone presence (Fig. 10) were reviewed to identify which of them were also within the depth interval defined from the Golden Zone maps. The depth reported on the Golden Zone maps of top and base (Figs. 12 and 13\n\n) for each of those giant fields were checked against the depth of the primary producing reservoirs reported in the Horn (2005) database, obtaining that 70% of giant oil and\/or gas fields reported in the Horn (2005) database are located inside a region with Golden Zone presence and within its depth interval defined by the Golden Zone maps of top and base estimated. Those fields contain 70% of the total hydrocarbon volume according to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) reported in the Horn (2005) database.\nThe global Golden Zone thickness values range mainly between 5\u00a0m and 3000\u00a0m (Fig. 11), with a medium value of 1000\u00a0m. The global Golden Zone depths range mainly between 500 and 3000\u00a0m for the top (Fig. 12) with a medium value of 1000\u00a0m, and the base shows a depth range mainly between 1000 and 5000\u00a0m with a medium value of 2500\u00a0m (Fig. 13). In regions such as northern Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, northeast Africa, the Arabian Gulf, the Ural Mountains, northern Europe, and the Siberian Platform, the Golden Zone is deeper with values of depth above 2500\u00a0m and 4500\u00a0m for top and base, respectively, and with the most significant thicknesses above the 2500\u00a0m. The Golden Zone maps estimated show that along active tectonic margins, the sedimentary sequences tend to be thin with fewer regions of Golden Zone presence, due to abrupt contrasts of the basement producing one or both isotherms that define the Golden Zone are below the basins, preventing its proper development. Some exceptions to this trend can be found in the forelands and intermountain basins. In contrast, the passive margins concentrate more regions with Golden Zone presence; where the sedimentary sequences present a wide range of thicknesses with conditions predominate for basins of diverse ages and extensions.\nThe base map indicates the maximum depth expected for the Golden Zone. According to the Golden Zone definition given by Buller et al. (2005), the possibility of finding important oil and\/or gas reservoirs is reduced below it, and the sedimentary formations are susceptible to high overpressures that may lead to hydraulic fractures. Thus, the Golden Zone base depth map (Fig. 13) could contribute to the risk assessment in hydrocarbon exploration, preventing overpressure accidents while well drilling (see, for example, Akretche and Okbi, 1995; Hurst, 2011) by predicting the depths where overpressure zones could occur, which constitute a risk factor on the drilling side for encountering unanticipated high overpressure zones (Lerche, 1996) and hydraulic fracturing of strata. For the Golden Zone theory to be useful in risk assessment or hydrocarbons exploration, local geothermal data must be incorporated to model temperature variations with an adequate resolution for the target study area size. The geothermal gradient map estimated in this work presents a global scale that does not provide the necessary resolution to make local scale evaluations. In addition, according to Quigley and Mackenzie (1988), oil is formed inside the sub-surface and maintains stability between 100 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. For gas, the temperature ranges between 150 and 220\u00a0\u00b0C. It means that once the oil is created, probably the Golden Zone base depth only guarantees its preservation, and cracking could be a marginal process to disregard.\nBased on the Golden Zone presence map (Fig. 10), there are regions with Golden Zone where few or no oil and\/or gas fields have been reported and where it should be researched if the petroleum system elements were formed within an appropriate relative timing to generate hydrocarbon accumulations, considering that the Golden Zone presence only guarantees an optimal conditions zone for oil and\/or gas to be accumulated. These regions have not been explored for hydrocarbon resources due to environmental, political, or social reasons. Some cases, such as Greenland, constitute frontier basins, where there have exploration has been suspended due to Greenlandic governmental concerns that the price of oil extraction is too high based upon economic calculations; and, considerations of the impact on climate and the environment (Battersby, 2021) despite the island's touted hydrocarbon potential. Another example is along the United States Atlantic margin, virtually unexplored. Only 51 wells were drilled between 1975 and 1984. Five were COST (Continental Offshore Stratigraphic Tests) wells and 46 industry exploration wells (Egorov, 2018). There is a similar scenario along the Atlantic margin of Argentina, where the offshore sedimentary basins remain largely underexplored; and recently (2017\u20132018), regional 2D seismic data acquired have identified five major structural domains with hydrocarbon perspectivity on the northern margin of Argentina and four on the southern margin. Still, the deep-water of the undrilled Argentina Basin represents a true frontier for hydrocarbon exploration (DeVito and Kearns, 2022). In the eastern margin of Africa, the most globally successful region of the 21st century for conventional frontier exploration, drilling has resulted in several publications that have provided a comprehensive summary of the state of knowledge of regional tectonics across east Africa and their influence on petroleum systems (e.g., Fletcher, 2017; Logering and Milkov, 2017; Simon et al., 2017; Oil Corp, 2016; Dale et al., 2016; Sayers, 2016; Palermo et al., 2014; Brown, 2013; Zhou et al., 2013; Abeinomugisha and Kasande, 2012; Clark and Rasoanandrianina, 2002); the summary also provides greater detail on the numerous petroleum discoveries, and knowledge about of the most significant discoveries in each basin, in terms of reserve additions (Macgregor et al., 2017). Offshore eastern Australia, also poorly understood, with few detailed seismic studies and many questions regarding the nature and age of the sedimentary deposits and bedrock, remains a petroleum exploration frontier area (Australian Government Geoscience Australia, Offshore Eastern Australia: https:\/\/www.ga.gov.au\/scientific-topics\/energy\/province-sedimentary-basin-geology\/petroleum\/offshore-eastern-australia).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nGlobal distribution of hydrocarbon reservoirs\nCurrent global distribution patterns of hydrocarbon accumulations can be identified based on the Golden Zone presence map and the world's oil and gas fields location database. Mann et al. (2001) defined 20 oil regions globally based on the distribution of 592 giant oil and gas fields. Then, Mann et al., 2003 updated the previous work by defining 27 oil regions based on 877 giant fields (names of the hydrocarbon provinces are listed in Table B1 in Appendix B). Overlapping the oil regions defined by Mann et al. (2001) and (2003) over the Golden Zone presence map estimated, a good concordance between them is observed (Fig. 14\n), showing the same prospective regions for hydrocarbon accumulations locations globally.\nUsing the locations of the 2222 oil and gas fields comprised by the Petroleum Dataset PETRADATA v 1.2 (Lujala et al., 2007) and the giant oil and gas fields database (Horn, 2005), modifications and additions to those regions defined by Mann et al. (2001) and (2003) were performed. Fig. 15\n shows the total oil regions resulting (names are listed in Table B2 in Appendix B), observing that more oil regions and prospective areas can be defined using more oil and gas field locations and including the Golden Zone presence map.\n\n\n4.2\nThe geothermal gradient controls the global Golden Zone distribution\nThe Golden Zone parameters of thickness, top depth, and base depth corresponding to each giant field on the database reported by (Horn, 2005) were defined by the Golden Zone maps of top depth, base depth, and thickness. The Golden Zone thickness and depth variation are associated with the global geothermal gradient patterns. Fig. 16\nAB shows that the thicknesses and depths decrease inversely proportional to the geothermal gradient. Fig. 16B indicates the limits for Golden Zone thickness, represented by the two lines, green and blue (Fig. 1). The green line with a slope of 2 represents the maximum thickness possible, which occurs when the Golden Zone base is shallower than the sediment layer base, and the points over this green line correspond to the scenario of zone 2. The points below the green line correspond to the scenario of zone 1, where the thicknesses are smaller because the Golden Zone base is deeper than the sediment layer base. The blue line with a slope of 1 represents the minimum thickness possible, and below the blue line, there is no Golden Zone because the top depth is deeper than the sediment layer base.\nThese results are consistent with the Golden Zone definition given by Buller et al. (2005), which identified that the Golden Zone's top depth and thickness variation is associated with the geothermal gradient variations. Based on the above results (Fig. 16), the Golden Zone is expected to be shallower and thinner in basins subjected to high geothermal gradients. In basins with low geothermal gradients, the Golden Zone is expected to be deeper and thicker. Additional 2D graphs for properties characterization of Giant Oil and Gas fields (Horn, 2005) inside the Golden Zone are included in the supplementary material of this paper.\n\n\n4.3\nLateral variations of the Golden Zone in some regions\nThe Golden Zone depths maps of top and base were graphed to analyze their variations to determine if there is a defined pattern for the Golden Zone depths and thicknesses associated with the hydrocarbon regions. For each point on the global database (Fig. 3), the associated Golden Zone depths and thickness were estimated using the geothermal gradients reported for each data point from direct temperature measurements. Then the points were grouped by the hydrocarbon region where they are located. In Fig. 17\n, just 10 of the 29 defined oil regions (listed in Table B2 in Appendix B) are included in this graph. In general terms, it's observed that each area has a defined range of thickness, top, and base depths of the Golden Zone. This observation is associated with the tectonic elements that rule out each region. Additional graphs for evaluating Golden Zone top and base depth variations for all the oil regions defined (Fig. 15) are included in the supplementary material of this paper to show their ranges and trends.\nThe West African region (represented by the letter H in Fig. 17) is located where the Golden Zone is shallowest and has the least thickness; the depths of the top and base are lower than 1200\u00a0m and 2400\u00a0m, respectively, and the geothermal gradient is greater than 50\u00a0\u00b0C\/km in most of the region (Fig. 17). The high geothermal gradients observed here could be attributed to a higher heat flow associated with large salt deposits, providing localized areas with an increased geothermal gradient. Salt has a thermal conductivity two to four times higher than sedimentary rocks. Therefore, sediments above salt structures are expected to have a higher geothermal gradient and positive temperature anomalies (Skinner and Wach, 2021). The main tectonic elements for this region are (Fig. 18\n): the intracratonic basins Bida and Doha in the north, both associated with the rift system of Central Africa. The Bida Basin is a shallow no-faulted arm of the Benue Trough (Wang and Li, 2018), and the Doha Basin is an elongated failed rift (Peterson, 1985). Between those basins is the Niger Delta, an extensional rift covering the Benue Trough (Reijers et al., 1997). From north to south they are located in the Gabon, Congo, Cuanza, and Namibe basins (Ala and Selley, 1997; Gindre-Chanu et al., 2016) all represent marginal depocenters for Aptian salt deposits formed by the seafloor spreading resulting from the separation of South America and Africa. These basins merge to the west in a wedge of sediments thinning at the west. Each of these basins is related to a river system with a tectonic style and facies similar to the basins located on the west coast of Brazil. The West African salt basins extend over 1500\u00a0km along the western coast of Africa from the volcanoes zone situated in the south of the Niger Delta ending in the Cuanza Basin, and the average width of the salt basin province is about 200\u00a0km from onshore coastal plains to the offshore continental slope (Bjor\u00f8y et al., 1996).\nThe Ural Mountains region (represented by the letter F in Fig. 17) is located where the Golden Zone is deeper and reaches the most significant thicknesses; the depths of the top and base reach almost 4000\u00a0m and 8000\u00a0m, respectively, and the geothermal gradient is lower than 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km in most of the region (Fig. 17). The low geothermal gradients observed here could be attributed to an anomalous area of low heat flux reported in the Urals by Golovanova et al. (2008). According to Kukkonen et al. (1997), the low heat flow density (HFD) anomaly is present in the central parts of the fold belt extending from the Kazakhstan Plain in the south (48\u00b0N) to the northern Urals, at least to latitude 61\u00b0N. Kukkonen et al. (1997) mentioned that the low HFD of the Urals could be attributed to several factors, among the following: 1) surficial disturbances produced by groundwater circulation in the bedrock because of the high topography, the transient paleoclimatic disturbances produced by the extremely cold climatic conditions and the propagation or the ground surface temperature changes to depth; and 2) the lithospheric factors due to the coincidence with the Tagil-Magnitogorsk Zone, which is dominated by mafic rocks with low concentrations of heat-producing elements. The main tectonic elements for this region are (Fig. 19\n): the Timan-Pechora basin located northeast of the European Platform, which includes the Timan Ridge highland and the Pechora Plain (Prischepa, 2011). The Pechora Plain is situated north of the region between the Urals and Timan Ridge, which has an NW-SE trend and intersects the Ural Mountains at the southern end of the basin (Lindquist, 1999). To the south is situated the Volga-Ural basin, a regional high in the central part of the European Platform (Jaupart and Mareschal, 2015) that limits to the south with the North Caspian basin (Precaspian Basin), which is a pericratonic depression with salt diapirs dated since the Kungurian age (Okere and Toothill, 2012).\nAn additional table and figures with descriptions for the 39 oil regions (Fig. 15) are part of the supplementary material of this paper, which contains the description of the main tectonic elements, basin type, number of oil and gas fields, geothermal gradient, and Golden Zone thickness.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe global map of CPD shows values ranging between 10\u00a0km and 50\u00a0km with an average percentage error of 6%; on this map, the tectonic limits between the continental and oceanic regions are differentiated; as well as the main geological features, like the ridges in the oceanic region and the shields in the continental region.\nThe geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD presents higher values in the oceanic region relative to the continental region, exhibiting the same regional trends as the CPD map due to the relationship used for its estimation. This geothermal gradient map does not reflect local trends very well. It lacks calibration to real temperature data, thereby constituting an intermediate step for the global geothermal gradient map final estimation by integrating it into the global database compiled.\nThe worldwide geothermal gradient map estimated by interpolation of the global database integrated with the geothermal gradient map estimated by CPD presents a range of values from 10\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 90\u00a0\u00b0C\/km. The oceanic regions present higher values than the continental regions. The prominent mid-ocean ridges and the shields are well defined in the oceanic and continental regions, respectively. This map shows more regional trends and a global geothermal gradient model better adjusted to real temperature data.\nSeventy-seven percent of the giant hydrocarbon fields reported in the Horn (2005) database are located inside regions with Golden Zone presence, and 70% of the giant fields are also located inside its depth interval defined by the top and base depths estimated; those last giants fields contain 70% of the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) reported by the Horn (2005) database. The global Golden Zone maps show values ranging mainly between 5\u00a0m and 3000\u00a0m for thickness, 500\u00a0m\u20133000\u00a0m for top depth, and 1000\u00a0m\u20135000\u00a0m for base depth.\nThe location of the oil regions defined by Mann et al. (2001) and (2003) show a good concordance relative to the Golden Zone presence map estimated by observing regions of Golden Zone over all the oil regions defined by Mann et al. (2001) and (2003). Also, the global Golden Zone presence map estimated, in conjunction with the locations of hydrocarbon fields database collected, constitutes an effective tool for global distribution patterns of hydrocarbon identification, contributing to new hydrocarbon prospective regions' definition.\nThe Golden Zone depth maps show that thicknesses and depths decrease inversely proportional to the geothermal gradient. In basins subjected to high geothermal gradients, such as the Western Africa region, the Golden Zone is expected to be shallower and thinner. In basins with low geothermal gradients, such as the Ural Mountains region, the Golden Zone is expected to be deeper and thicker.\n\n","47":"","48":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nIn general rocks exhibit a wide range of structures and properties even within formations that seem well-defined stratigraphically (Al Zainaldin et al., 2017). This is especially the case for carbonate rocks because they have almost always been subjected to post-depositional reworking by a range of diagenetic processes (Mohammed Sajed and Glover, 2020; Mohammed Sajed et al., 2021) which can lead to heterogeneity and anisotropy that is not necessarily bed-bound (Sinan et al., 2020). The recognition of groups of core samples or well-logging intervals that share a generic microstructure and transport properties is usually carried out by defining units based on either core scale sedimentological and geological evidence (Jiang et al., 2021), microfacies based on optical or scanning electron micrographic evidence (Liu and Song, 2020; Yarmohammadi et al., 2020) or petrofacies, which are allocated on the basis of petrophysical properties (Kopaska-Merkel et al., 1989; Cao et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2020). Some have used a smaller set of properties which are directly related to reservoir quality to make the classification (Mohammed-Sajed and Glover, 2022). While all of these methods use both qualitative observations and quantitative measurements, they are all classification schemes that do not inform physical processes. Nevertheless, facies allocation is a first and significant step in the analysis of a carbonate rock.\nConventionally, facies definition and distribution is very time-consuming and expensive since it involves the in-depth analysis of well cores, well logs, downhole measurements, analogue studies and is holistic in nature (Bestagini et al., 2017). Such manual analysis of large datasets by a reservoir geologist or petrophysicist must be subjective to some extent, leading to increased uncertainties and the introduction of artefacts (Ren et al., 2019).\nBy contrast, machine learning processes provide the opportunity to make the process of facies recognition more automatic and objective (Witten et al., 2011). The accuracy of the result depends on the relevance and complexity of the method, and critically on the relevance and quality of the attributes that represent the input physical properties (Larose, 2006; Witten et al., 2011).\nIn machine learning, facies recognition may be approached by using either clustering or classification (Witten et al., 2011). Table 1\n shows the differences between these two approaches. Clustering is simpler, does not require foreknowledge of the number or properties of the facies, and does not need training. However, it can only separate facies on the basis of the natural similarity or difference in the properties (which are called attributes in machine learning parlance) and hence it provides more general solutions (Larose, 2006). These aspects of clustering give it advantages in facies recognition where only an attribute dataset exists. However, if facies in one well have already been defined and it is necessary to find to which of these facies a sample or samples in another well belong, classification must be used.\nIn recent years, initially multivariate statistical methods (Fang and Feng, 2021; Al-Qassab et al., 2000), and more recently machine learning methods have been increasingly used (Al Anazi and Gates, 2010; Alexsandro et al., 2017; Imamverdiyev and Sukhostat, 2019). Approaches looking at microfacies and petrofacies include many of those already cited (Jiang et al., 2021; Liu and Song, 2020; Yarmohammadi et al., 2020; Kopaska-Merkel and Friedman, 1989; Cao et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2020). These approaches are almost always classification schemes which only take account of isolated data for a given core or depth, with no account taken of how the facies will also partially be correlated with depth. Consequently, some of the more recent implementations have attempted to incorporate the constraint imposed by partial depth correlation (e.g., Santos et al., 2022) or seek to improve accuracy by adding methodological complexity (Nanjo and Tanaka, 2020; Tewari and Dwivedi, 2020). While extremely effective, these models are very complex, the Santos model, for example, requiring the implementation of Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Deep Recurrent Neural Networks.\nClustering (Cai et al., 2022) is a much simpler approach that has the potential to provide \u2018sufficiently good\u2019 separation of samples into clusters that represent samples with similar properties with no foreknowledge of the characteristics of each of the clusters, and often does not require knowing the number of clusters (Kanungo et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2008). Clustering can be used as a first step to obtain the number and properties of facies before submitting data to a classification scheme which trains the data to the facies derived from clustering and ultimately then uses the trained process to classify further data (Ren et al., 2022).\nThe question is what is \u2018sufficiently good\u2019. At the moment there is little information available on whether clustering can be used on petrophysical data from geologically diverse diagenetically-altered carbonates, which methods perform best, and to understand how to fine-tune the use of such models especially with regard to the number and types of attributes and whether to specify the number of clusters to be produced or to leave that decision to the method.\nThis paper has several goals. The first is to examine and test the accuracy of some of the machine learning clustering methods available, the second is to ascertain which are the most effective for use with petrophysical data. The quality of the results obtained from machine learning methods depends critically on the quality and relevance of its input data. Consequently, it is also the goal of this paper to find which petrophysical input parameters (attributes) make good discriminators for facies separation, and whether it is better to have foreknowledge of the number of groups of data in a given dataset so that the facies definition process can be constrained. Most of the tests have been carried out on a large database of 307 samples containing 5 stratigraphically defined facies, and for which an extensive set of high quality petrophysical measurements are available, including poroperm, electrical, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\n1.1\nData sets\nIn this section, we examine the three main datasets used in this modelling. Table 2\n summarises the sample numbers together with which measured and calculated parameters appear in each dataset. All methodologies used to obtain the measured parameters are given in Al Khalifah et al. (2020).\nThe first dataset contains data from 202 sample from three beds of the Portland limestone, which crops out in quarries on the Isle of Portland (Dorset, UK). All samples were obtained from the Fancy Beach or Jordans quarries (50\u00b033\u203210\u2033N 02\u00b026\u203225\u2033W) and are from beds within the Upper Jurassic Portland Freestone, a well-cemented oolitic limestone (Barton et al., 2011) which has traditionally been used in construction.\nThe Isle of Portland primarily consists of marine strata from the Upper Jurassic overlain by a thin layer of basal Cretaceous Purbeck Formation, which lies on top of the Portland Freestone and which marks the bottom of the Cretaceous. The true Portland Stone, a well-cemented oolitic limestone, lies immediately below the Cretaceous Purbeck Formation. Certain beds of the Portland Freestone have been used both throughout history and currently as high quality architectural building stone. It composes many of the civic and religious buildings in the UK, such as The Cenotaph (1920), St. Paul's Cathedral (1677), The British Museum (1753) and the Parkinson Building (University of Leeds, 1938\u20131951), but is also used globally, as in the United Nations Building in New York (1952), and Auckland War Memorial Museum, New Zealand (1929). The stone has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource. Portland Cherty Series lies immediately below the Portland Freestone and above The Portland Sand, which consists predominantly of marls with interbedded sandy layers. Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay lies below the Portland sand and is the lowest formation exposed in the area, occurring beneath Castletown and Portland Harbour. It is exposed at the foot of the high northern cliffs or the Isle of Portland when not covered by talus.\nThis paper uses data from three beds; the Base Bed (72 samples), Whit Bed (58), and Hard Blue (72). All of these formations are dominated by sparite-cemented oolites (Barton et al., 2011). The data from the first two of these were used previously in initial machine learning permeability prediction studies using genetic algorithms by Al Khalifah et al. (2020), whose results we later compare the results from this work. Al Khalifah et al. (2020) note that the Whitbed contains common shells, usually distributed evenly, but sometimes concentrated in zones. These shells are commonly cemented. The Base bed is less shelly and commonly contains completely cemented shell moulds. The cemented nature of this rock makes it ideal building stone as well as a good, well-studied tight carbonate reservoir analogue. The Hard Blue bed is highly cemented and presents a much lower porosity and permeability than the other two beds.\nEach bed has its own characteristic range of porosities and permeabilities, which overlap each other, with the Whit Bed having the highest porosity and permeability and the Hard Blue having the least porosity and permeability when taken as a group. The petrophysical characteristics of the beds will be described in detail later in the paper.\nThe second dataset contains 61 samples of Purbeck limestone from the Swanage Quarry (now California Quarry) at (50\u00b035\u203249\u2033N 01\u00b058\u203230\u2033W). This Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous limestone occurs stratigraphically just above the Portland Freestone. In this work all samples were taken from the Button Bed of the Purbeck limestone with an age of about 155\u00a0Ma, which has a lower porosity, permeability and pore throat size than other Purbeck limestone horizons (Baud et al., 2021; Brantut et al., 2018).\nThe third dataset contains 44 samples of Solnhofen limestone from the Solnhofen Stone Group Quarry near Solnhofen in Germany at (48\u00b053\u203202\u2033N 10\u00b058\u203244\u2033W). Solnhofen stone is a Late Jurassic limestone from the Jura mountains which has long been famed for its building and sculpting qualities as well as its exceptional preservation of a range of palaeobiota. Its small porosity, permeability and pore throat diameter distribution result from an homogeneous microstructure which arises from the sedimentation of micritic particles into an extremely calm environment (Koch, 2007; Baud et al., 2000).\n\n\n1.2\nExperimental methods\nThe measurements comprising the datasets arise from five different independent measurement methods. These are (i) pycnometry, (ii) permeametry, (iii) electrical measurements, (iv) mercury injection capillary pressure measurements (MICP), and (v) NMR spectroscopy. Consequently, any of the basic parameters shown in Table 1 from any of these independent approaches can be compared with each other according to the codes given in the bottom line of the table.\nPycnometry was carried out to obtain porosity on 1.5\u201d diameter cores with an apparatus designed and built in-house with an accuracy of \u00b10.001 (i.e., 0.1% porosity). Porosity was also obtained by fluid saturation\/Archimedes bulk volume and by MICP, but these data are not used as it was found that the difficulty in fully saturating these tight limestones with water or mercury led to systematic underestimations of porosity.\nPermeametry was carried out using two methods depending on the permeability of the samples. A Klinkenberg-corrected steady-state helium flow approach was used for the higher permeability samples. The permeability of lower permeability samples was measured using helium pulse-decay permeametry (Jones, 1997). No systematic difference between the approaches was noted.\nElectrical measurements of resistivity were made on fully saturated samples of the fluid saturating the rock using a Quadtech LCR meter at a frequency where the quadrature component was smallest (near 1\u00a0kHz). Formation factor F, connectedness G, connectivity \u03c7, and cementation exponent m were all calculated from the electrical measurements and porosity according to the methodologies set out in Glover (2015).\nMercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements were carried out with a Micromeritics Autopore V up to a maximum applied pressure of 60,000 psi. The measured capillary pressure\/incremental mercury intrusion data were inverted to provide the pore throat diameter distribution of each sample. This data was used to calculate a pore diameter distribution using the method of (Glover and D\u00e9ry, 2010), and the grain size distribution was subsequently calculated by combining the pore size distribution, porosity and electrical measurements according to the method of Glover and Walker (2009).\nNuclear Magnetic Spectroscopy was carried out using a 2\u00a0MHz MARAN Ultra spectrometer from Oxford Instruments, inverting the T\n2 spectra to obtain Free Fluid Index (FFI) and Bulk Volume Irreducible (BVI) using a variable cut-off informed by the capillary pressure curve.\nMore details of experimental measurements are given in Al Khalifah et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n2\nData summary\n\nFigure 1\n shows the distributions of porosity and permeability for each of the datasets. For the Portland limestone, the three component beds can be distinguished reasonably clearly on the basis of porosity, with the Hard Blue bed occupying low values with no overlap with the values of the other two beds. The Base Bed and Whit Bed exhibit higher porosities, with the Whit Bed having the higher porosities, but with a significant overlap. Table 3\n shows the descriptive statistics for each bed and each dataset. However, when the permeability is considered, there is a significant overlap of all three beds even though the order of the modal values for the data from each bed is the same as that for porosity. There are even several Whit Bed samples with permeabilities lower than most of the Hard Blue samples. The porosities exhibited by the Purbeck limestone are roughly coincident with those of the Portland Hard Blue, while the Solnhofen limestone has porosities covering the same range, but extending higher, to about 14%. The permeabilities exhibited by both the Purbeck and Solnhofen limestones are distributed over the whole range that was occupied by all three Portland limestone beds.\nClearly, there are other parameters than porosity controlling permeability. These are partially known, and discussed in the next section. They include characteristic grain size and cementation exponent (Rashid et al., 2015a; 2015b; Glover et al., 2006). Fig. 2\n shows cross-plots between porosity and formation factor, cementation exponent, characteristic pore throat and pore diameters and characteristic grain size as well as between characteristic pore throat size and free fluid index (FFI) from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements and with characteristic grain size, all for all datasets. They show that the Hard Blue bed ought to be easy to separate from the other two Portland limestone beds, but would probably be difficult to separate from a mixture of data from all the datasets.\nPart (a) of Fig. 3\n shows a Poroperm diagram of all of the datasets. This figure summarises the relationship of hydraulic flow with the parameters controlling it (porosity, characteristic grain size, \u03b7, and cementation exponent).\nWe have imposed dashed theoretical curves from the RGPZ-carbonate model (Rashid et al., 2015b) with constant m\u00a0=\u00a02.1 (being the arithmetic mean of the combined Portland dataset), constant \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a01.73 (from Rashid et al., 2015b) and using four characteristic grain sizes, which vary from 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0m to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0m. We have also added a further set of RGPZ-carbonate model curves holding characteristic grain size constant at d\n\ngrain\n\u00a0=\u00a01.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m, which is the geometric mean of the characteristic grain size for the combined Portland dataset, with a constant \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a01.73 (from Rashid et al., 2015b) and using four values of cementation exponent varying from 2.0 to 3.5 on increments of 0.5.\nIt is clear that each control on permeability has a significant role to play. Permeability generally increases with increasing porosity and grain size but decreases with increasing cementation exponent or \u03b7. The clouds of data points can be associated with a particular range of each of the parameters. However, the spread of the data with respect to different RGPZ-carbonate curves for different characteristic grain size, \u03b7 and cementation exponent illustrates the difficulty in predicting permeability or cementation exponent from such overlapping data, where permeability is controlled by multiple parameters.\nPart (b) of Fig. 3 shows a Poroconn diagram of all of the datasets. By contrast with the Poroperm plot, this plot summarises the relationship of electrical flow with the parameters controlling it (only porosity and cementation exponent). As before, we have imposed theoretical lines on the plot in accordance with the equation \n\nG\n=\n\n\n\u03c6\nm\n\n\n (Glover, 2015) for values of cementation exponent from 1.5 to 3.0 in increments of 0.5.\nOnce again this figure intimates that the Base Bed and Whit Bed samples might be separated from each other and from the rest of the datasets on the basis of these data, but that the Hard Blue, Purbeck Button Bed and Solnhofen limestone data is likely to be inseparable.\nThe next two sections consider the machine learning methods that may be used to cluster a mixed dataset and to implement the methods using the combined Portland limestone dataset. Subsequently, all of the datasets will be used to test the limitations on the efficacy of prediction of permeability using 12 machine learning datasets, 7 conventional approaches and using Genetic Algorithms.\n\n2.1\nClustering methods\nWe have used input data that are based on stratigraphically-defined beds. It would be easier to define the test machine learning clustering in terms of petrofacies-defined classes than stratigraphically-defined classes. This is because the process of defining petrofacies-based classes automatically \u2018cleans-up\u2019 the natural variability of a given stratigraphically delineated bed by not including samples which do not fit the strict criteria upon which the petrofacies are defined. This would be the case even if the natural variability led to samples of a given type having petrophysical characteristics falling outside the petrofacies definition. Such a process would be an artificial intervention and partially invalidate any attempt to cluster by using machine learning. In addition, if machine learning techniques are to be useful in the real world, they must be able to handle data as it comes to us, and that means data that is not previously classified.\nA total of 8 data clustering methods have been implemented using the artificial intelligence platform Weka\u00ae (ver. 3.8.5) (Frank et al., 2016). All of the methods used in this paper are shown in Table 4\n, noting that the KMeans and Hierarchical clustering algorithms were implemented using both the Euclidean and Manhattan distance functions. We have tuned each method to optimise its efficiency.\nSome methods allow for optional approaches which we have implemented whenever it was pragmatic to do so. For example, the KMeans and Hierarchical clustering algorithms allow a number of distance functions to be explored. We have used the Euclidean, Minkowski or Manhattan distance functions in this work. All distance-based methods used in this work include a normalisation of the input values to ensure that the results can be compared. Initial testing has implemented eight methods on the Portland dataset with the number of clusters set to 3 a priori if allowed by the algorithm (all cases except the Cobweb method) in order to examine the efficacy of each method.\nIt is not known in advance which attributes are powerful in aiding clustering, which are helpful in distinguishing between two particular clusters, or even which attributes are so insensitive to cluster membership that they degrade the efficacy of clustering if included in the attributes for a given test. Consequently, we have used a 3-cluster implementation of the EM method to examine the results from all 31 combinations of the five independent parameters in this work. These tests include using all attributes, using all combinations of 4, 3 and 2 attributes as well as each attribute alone.\nMost methods allow the number of clusters to be set in advance, but this is not always required. In the case of the Portland limestone, there are three clusters, each associated with a bed within the formation. We have implemented clustering with unconstrained number of clusters, where possible, as well as for 2, 3, 4 and 5 defined clusters using the combined Portland-Purbeck-Solnhofen dataset. We note that it is extremely challenging to separate 5 clusters with overlapping properties using 5 attributes.\nFinally, all implementations described above have been run ten times with different stochastic seeds such that all results represent statistically valid implementations, and allow a measure of spread to be given in all of our results plots.\nIn summary, there were a total of 5 facies in 3 databases that were clustered with 8 clustering approaches using all combinations of 5 attributes, 11 pre-defined cluster targets and one instance of an undefined cluster target number, resulting in a total of 990 machine learning implementations.\nThe accuracy of clustering has been judged on the basis that the algorithms provide not only the correct number of clusters, but that the number of samples falling into each cluster are in accord with the real partitioning of the Base Bed, Whit Bed and Hard Blue formations, and most critically, that each sample is correctly clustered. These are judgements of success based on the known number of original classes and the known stratigraphical classification of each sample.\n\n2.1.1\nClustering results\nMachine learning clustering algorithms have been applied initially to the Portland dataset and later to the combined Portland-Purbeck-Solnhofen dataset. Machine learning processes generally perform better when used with normally-distributed attributes (Witten et al., 2011). In all cases we use the untransformed values of porosity, cementation exponent and FFI because they are distributed quasi-normally. The pore throat size and permeability are distributed approximately log-normally. Hence we use the logarithm to the base 10 of these parameters to obtain a quasi-normal distribution for them as well.\nHereafter, we use the term \u2018clustering success\u2019 rather than \u2018clustering accuracy\u2019. The word \u2018accuracy\u2019 would be a good one to use for the machine learning process of classification because this process places samples in any one of a number of pre-defined classes for which a degree of \u2018accuracy\u2019 can be calculated. However, the process of clustering does not have predefined clusters for which such an accuracy could be calculated. Instead we consider the success with which samples of the same type are gathered together in a cluster. The difference may appear trivial, but arises from fundamental differences between the processes of machine learning clustering and machine learning classification (Witten et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n\n3\nEfficacy of different clustering methods\nAs we have already seen, the Portland dataset contains data from 202 samples from three beds representing three facies with different but overlapping properties. We examine how effective each of the clustering algorithms are in recognising data from the three beds.\n\nFigure 4\n shows a comparison of 8 machine learning clustering methods, constraining the cluster number to 3 in all cases except for the Cobweb method where such a constraint is not available. In this figure the clustering has been carried out with the maximum available independent data. Accordingly, five input attributes are used, i.e., porosity, cementation exponent, the logarithm to the base 10 of the characteristic pore throat size, the logarithm to the base 10 of the permeability, FFI. Other parameters are derived from one or from a number of the other parameters. Clustering success rate is calculated as the percentage of samples clustered successfully.\nIt is clear that some methods are much better than others. The EM and two Kmeans methods (Euclidean and Manhattan distance models) perform best, with clustering success rates of over 90% (92.58%, 89.60% and 91.09%, respectively). The five other methods performed significantly worse. The hierarchical models were the worst of all (36.14% and 36.63% success rates for the Euclidean and Manhattan distance models, respectively), which is only slightly higher than the success rate expected from a random choice of one of the 3 facies (i.e., \n\n33.3\n\n3\n\u02d9\n\n\n%).\n\nTable 5\n shows the confusion matrices for the 8 clustering methods examined in this paper. In each case the horizontal columns reference the actual labels for the Base Bed (BB), Whit bed (WB) and Hard Blue (HB), while the vertical labels represent the clustering results. Success is measured by the closeness of the prime diagonal values to those of the \u2018Control\u2019 which represents 100% success. Off-diagonal values show errors where data from a certain formation has been included in another cluster. The values shown are the rounded means of the event numbers from 10 implementations of clustering (as in Fig. 4).\nThe clear distinction between the Hard Blue formation and the other two would lead to the expectation that the off-diagonal components related to the Hard Blue formation would be at or close to zero. This is indeed the case for the EM, Farthest First and both Kmeans methods. The remaining methods were not capable of distinguishing between the HB and the other formations. By contrast, it would be expected that the Base Bed and Whit Bed data would be more difficult to distinguish, and this is shown to be the case, with the Canopy, Cobweb, Farthest First and both Hierarchical methods effectively recognising the majority of BB and WB data to be of the same cluster. The likelihood is that this confusion is driven by overlap in more than one of the main petrophysical characteristics.\n\nFigure 5\n shows the results for the best performance (EM model) on a sample-by-sample basis for two attribute spaces, where correctly clustered points are shown as solid points and incorrectly clustered points are shown as open points with a line colour representing the cluster they should have been associated with. The perfect clustering of the Hard Blue facies is mainly due to the complete separation of this facies in terms of porosity as shown clearly in Fig. 5a. However, the 5-fold attribute dimension is important to be able to attain the high quality clustering between facies with overlapping properties, as between the Base Bed and Whit Bed in both parts of Fig. 5. It is instructive that the mis-clustered samples are not always in the zone of overlap between any two attributes.\n\n\n4\nEffect of different attributes\nThe importance of each attribute in the clustering process depends on the extent to which each attribute shows an ability to separate samples into their correct groups. Clearly, this will vary to some extent from dataset to dataset, but will also be related to what each individual attribute physically represents. Consequently, we have chosen to work with the best method we found in the previous section, the EM method, and have run it for all combinations of the 5 possible attributes, logging how each combination performs on the tight carbonate data represented by the Portland limestone group. In this process, we have started with the results of the 5-attribute, 3-cluster result already reported, then examined the clustering efficacy using the 5 combinations of 4 attributes, the 10 combinations of 3 attributes, then 10 combinations of 2 attributes and finally the 5 combinations of 1 attribute. The summary of all of this data is shown in Fig. 6\n. The data shown in this figure have been arranged by rank on the basis of success from the best on the left-hand of the figure to the worst on the right-hand side.\nIt is clear that the adage that more data is always better does not work. The implementations using all five attributes is ranked 9th in clustering quality. This implies that inclusion of some of the attributes actively degrades the clustering ability. Indeed, the top 5 attribute combinations are of only 2 or 3 attributes.\nPorosity occurs as an attribute in all of the top 13 combinations and in 16 of the top 18 combinations. Indeed use of porosity as a single attribute provides the 10th best performance (91.58%). This is an indicator that porosity is the most powerful attribute for clustering in this dataset. However, it will not necessarily be the case in all petrophysical datasets.\nEight of the 9 worst performers contain FFI in the attribute set, indicating that this attribute does not contribute to improvement in clustering, and probably degrades clustering. The addition of FFI to any combination of other attributes degrades performance by as much as 13 rank places, except, oddly when it is added to the single attribute porosity. Indeed, there is a small group of highly performing combinations which contain both porosity and FFI. There is something about this combination that seems to work well together for this carbonate dataset.\nAnalysis of the strength of attributes on the basis of Fig. 6 results in the order first porosity, followed by cementation exponent and the logarithm to the base 10 of permeability, then the logarithm to the base 10 of pore throat size, and finally FFI.\nThe spread in values (calculated as the range of data over 10 iterations) are not symmetrical and grow as the clustering worsens. This is to be expected because for those tests with good success rates there are fewer possible combinations of samples in each cluster, while poorly performing implementations struggle to allocate samples to a cluster, mis-clustering many samples which vary greatly between implementations with different seeds.\n\n\n5\nEffect of different cluster numbers\nThe results described in this section use the combined Portland-Purbeck-Solnhofen dataset. Figures 1 and 2 show that there is significant overlap in the attributes of the Base Bed and Whit Bed in the Portland samples as well as between the Portland Hard Blue samples and samples of the Purbeck and Solnhofen limestones.\nIn this section we carry out a number of clustering tests using (i) all 5 attributes, (ii) the 4 attributes [porosity, m, log10\nk, log10\nd\n\npt\n, FFI], (iii) the triad [porosity, m, log10\nk], (v) the dyad [porosity, m], and (v) porosity alone. Each set of attributes has been tested for 11 different specified numbers of clusters as well as the case where the method is unconstrained by a number of clusters. Each combination has been implemented 10 times, as throughout this paper, with the plotted results being the arithmetic mean of the 10 trials with error bars representing the full spread of results (i.e., minimum to maximum). This results in 600 trials of the EM method in this sub-section.\nOverall, all the results are worse than for the Portland dataset, with the best clustering success rate at only 69.38% (using all five attributes and leaving the number of clusters unconstrained). This arises because the clustering problem we have provided in the combined dataset is more difficult than the Portland dataset, with all clusters significantly overlapping with either one or two other clusters.\nFor the case where the number of clusters is undefined, the use of all attributes lead to a correct outcome of five clusters and a reasonable success rate (69.38%), which was the best of all of the tests. In other words, the method recognises that there are five clusters in the data even though their properties overlap significantly.\nRepeating the unconstrained tests of the EM method for the 4 attributes excluding FFI results in a significantly worse performance (58.96%) and larger spread of results as shown by the larger error bars. Both are due separate trials of the method recognising different numbers of clusters, in one case choosing 10 clusters.\nThe triad [porosity, m, log10\nk] performed best when applied to the Portland dataset as described in the previous subsection and shown in Fig. 6. It was not as successful with the more complex combined dataset. When asked to recognise clusters, the EM method recognised only 3 for all 10 implementations, failing to recognise both the Purbeck Button Bed and Solnhofen limestone as clusters in their own right. However, it recognised the other facies well, with a success rate of 63.52%.\nThe dyad porosity and cementation exponent was the best of the 2-attribute combinations when applied to the Portland dataset. Here in the more complex combined dataset, it performs fairly creditably with a success rate of 65.8% compared to most other combinations, but completely fails to recognise the Solnhofen limestone as a cluster in its own right, returning only 4 clusters.\nAs discussed in the previous subsection, porosity was the most powerful attribute in separating clusters for the Portland dataset. In the more complex combined dataset, it fails with a success rate of 46.90% because only 2 clusters were recognised in all 10 trials. In all cases the Base Bed was combined with the Whit Bed for one cluster, while the remaining 3 facies were combined into the second cluster. Difference in the detailed results between trials was restricted only to small variations on this theme.\nConsequently, trusting the clustering method to recognise the right number of clusters is difficult, but can produce the best results if there are enough attributes to separate the clusters reasonably.\nFor the results where the number of clusters was defined by the operator, some clear trends are apparent from Fig. 7\n. First, the number of mis-clustered samples increases with decreasing percentage clustering success as the number of clusters is progressively less than the real number of clusters. This is primarily because the clustering method is forced to place samples into too few categories, partitioning clusters between other clusters. Second, the number of mis-clustered samples also increases, again with decreasing percentage clustering success as the number of clusters is progressively more than the real number of clusters. In this case, the decrease in clustering efficiency is due to there being more categories than necessary, which leads to samples being placed in a cluster that is not required.\nExamination of Fig. 7 also shows generic differences between the number of attributes and the efficacy of classification which occur irrespective of the pre-defined number of clusters. The tests with 3 or more attributes all share one behaviour that leads to higher clustering success and lower mis-clustered samples compared with the tests with one or two attributes. These 3+ attributes show peak clustering success for 5 clusters as ought to be the case, whereas the 1- and 2-attribute trends peak at 4 clusters with the Solnhofen limestone samples generally being distributed between the Portland Hard Blue and Purbeck Button Bed clusters. Here is another example of needing to have enough attributes to provide efficient clustering.\nTaking all of the results in this subsection into account, we propose a rule-of-thumb that the number of independent attributes should be at least the same as the number of expected clusters, and preferably more.\n\n\n6\nWireline log data\nA set of data was used from well Bm-15 of the Butmah field, which is a tight carbonate field in the north-western Iraq (Mohammed Sajed and Glover, 2020; Mohammed Sajed et al., 2021). This data includes 11 possible attributes shown in Table 6\n over a depth range from 394.8\u00a0m continuous depth interval, representing 1317 depths.\nPetrofacies are classes of rock based upon petrophysical characteristics. There are 4 of these in the dataset used in this work as defined by and fully described in Mohammed Sajed et al. (2021). They have been given the labels A, B, C and D. Petrofacies A represents the best reservoir quality rock, followed by the others in alphabetic order. It is important that the clustering can distinguish between the best rock (Petrofacies A and B) from the lower quality rock, represented by Petrofacies C and especially Petrofacies D. Track 6 shows the petrofacies as defined by detailed petrophysical analysis, while Track 7 shows the results of clustering.\nTrack 4 of Fig. 8\n also contains a more detailed classification of reservoir rocks called Reservoir Classes. There are 9 reservoir classes, labelled numerically from 1 to 9, which are also described fully in Mohammed Sajed et al. (2021). These classes may be viewed as a more subtle classification of the rocks within the test well, and hence likely to pose a greater challenge to the clustering algorithm.\n\nFigure 9\n shows cross-plots of five of the attributes, coloured for the recognised petrofacies. It is immediately clear that there is considerable overlap between the petrofacies in all of the attributes except permeability. Consequently, we hypothesise that permeability will be the most powerful attribute in clustering, and that the other attributes may contribute little to the overall clustering success or even actively degrade it. We have not shown a diagram coloured for the 9 reservoir classes as these are even more interlinked. Consequently, the challenge to separate the nine reservoir classes is a very difficult one.\nWe have applied the Expectation Maximisation clustering method to ascertain if it can reasonably recognise the petrofacies and the reservoir classes by comparing the results with the manually analysed petrofacies and reservoir classes.\n\n6.1\nPetrofacies clustering\n\nFigure 10\n shows the results of 450 implementations of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm for 9 scenarios, including letting the method chose the number of clusters and for a predefined number of clusters from 1 to 8. Each of these has been carried out for 5 combinations of attributes, which have been chosen strategically (i.e., the use of all attributes) or based on efficacy (i.e., which is best). The combinations are: (i) all 11 attributes except CNPHI, (ii) the log10\nk and NPHI attributes, (iii) the log10\nk and CNPHI attributes, (iv) the log10\nk and DT attributes, and (v) log10\nk alone. As throughout this work, all implementations have been carried out 10 times with different seeds and the results shown are the arithmetic mean values with the error bars representing the total range of responses.\nLeaving the number of target clusters undefined led to a large range of results. Using 10 attributes gave the worst response with an average of 990.3 depths being mis-clustered into 20 clusters instead of the 4 that were actually present, giving a success rate of only 24.8%. By contrast the use of log10\nk and the dyad of log10\nk with the corrected neutron porosity were best (249 and 373 depths mis-clustered, 81.09% and 79.27% success rates, both respectively, and both predicting the correct number of clusters. These results indicate strongly that the inclusion of attributes which do not effectively separate data actively degrades the performance of the clustering process.\nThe trivial case where only 1 cluster is forced for this method counter-intuitively produce values less than 100% for all attribute combinations because the method recognises the density of data points as a cluster, automatically excluding outliers. This is the best that using 10 attributes can do, with all greater predefined cluster numbers giving lower efficacy, and only a 35.53% success rate for the imposition of the actual number of clusters present. For all other predefined cases the success rate increases to a peak near the actual number of clusters (3 or 4), sometimes significantly, for other attribute combinations, followed by a decrease as the predefined number of clusters increases further.\nConsidering only those results for the correct number of clusters, the combination of log10\nk and NPHI performs only moderately (458 depths mis-clustered and 66.56% success rate), but the performance increases substantially when the value of NPHI is corrected to take account that this log is only accurate for limestone and needs to be corrected for use in anhydrite, dolomite and shales. Once correction has been carried out, the combination of log10\nk and CNPHI performs best overall (110 depths mis-clustered and 91.65% success rate). Other reasonable performances include using log10\nk alone and the combination of log10\nk and the sonic log, giving (249 and 302 depths mis-clustered, 81.09% and 77.07% success rates, both respectively). The results of the case for using log10\u00a0k alone are also shown in Column 7 of Fig. 8, showing how close the prediction is to the petrofacies defined from analysis of the petrophysical properties and logs from the well (Column 6).\nConsequently, we infer that the clustering process using the Expectation Maximisation method can work very well even if the number of attributes is less than the number of clusters, but only if the attributes separate the data well. This is a general feature of even the best machine learning codes, if the input data is garbage, the output will also be garbage (GIGO).\n\n6.1.1\nReservoir class clustering\nThe best performance for predicting the 4 petrofacies was 91.65%. The question now arises how effectively the 9 reservoir classes may be clustered. Fig. 11\n shows the results of 390 implementations of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm for 13 scenarios, including letting the method chose the number of clusters and for a predefined number of clusters from 1 to 12. Each of these has been carried out for the 3 combinations of attributes: (i) all 11 attributes except CNPHI, (ii) a restricted range of attributes defined in Table 5, and (iii) log10\u00a0k only. As throughout this work, all implementations have been carried out 10 times with different seeds and the results shown are the arithmetic mean values with the error bars representing the total range of responses.\nAs we have already noted, separating 9 clusters from a set of attributes which overlap so much is extremely challenging. The results shown in Fig. 11 are typical for most combinations of attributes. Leaving the number of clusters undefined resulted in 12, 14 and 4 predicted clusters for the three sets of attributes, respectively, with low success rates (33.82%, 33.74%, 36.90%, respectively). All of these can be considered to be failures as they provide clearly wrong sets of clusters, but success rates are still higher than a random allocation of depths to clusters, which would have a success rate of 11.11%.\nFor the predefined cluster tests, there was a peak for all sets of attributes caused by groups of clusters being well-recognised, but a low success rate for most pre-defined cluster results from 4 to 12 clusters, including the 9-cluster result which represents reality. For the 9-cluster solutions, the worst result was for the use of log10\nk alone (938.9 mis-clustered events, 28.71% success rate), which is the opposite than we found for the prediction of the 4 petrofacies earlier. The results from the full 10 attributes and the restricted attribute dataset were similar (848.4 and 863.1 mis-clustered depths and 35.58% and 34.46% success rates, respectively) with the full dataset providing marginally the better results. Once again, all of these results, while better than random allocation, are insufficiently good to be used in practice. Consequently, we conclude that the complexity of the wireline dataset used is too great a challenge for the attributes that were available to us.\n\n\n\n6.2\nAdvantages and limitations of clustering\nClustering has a number of clear advantages over classification schemes. The prime advantage is that it requires no training and does not depend on a previously created classification scheme. This makes clustering an inherently more general and robust method for grouping data. The lack of any assumptions and training to those assumptions, implies that the clustering scheme has, in principle, a less constrained ability to form clusters.\nNevertheless, it is certainly the case that clustering has not been nearly as popular as classification schemes. This is almost certainly due to the nervousness of researchers to let the clustering algorithms loose without supervision. Those requiring facies to be separated into like clusters would rather it be done into classes they define for whatever anthropic predisposition.\nSo, fundamentally, clustering does not provide recognition of any particular set of facies but a recognition of similarity, to which a human may later assign a facies label. By contrast, classification starts with the definition of particular facies, to which a machine learning algorithm might assign data, having been trained to do so. The clustering algorithm is to the classification algorithm as an artist is to an accountant. The later might be more reliable, but is less likely to provide as much insight.\nClustering does have a number of clear disadvantages. The first is that this work makes it clear that clustering works better if there is prior knowledge of the number of clusters that would best describe the dataset. If this is unknown, some algorithms exist which can optimise for the number of clusters, and this work has shown them to work well. Alternatively, the search for the best number of clusters could be done by batch application with a human choice of best cluster number. This has also been done in this work, and found to work well, but is onerous if not automated.\nThe second important disadvantage is that the clustering algorithm can become overwhelmed if there are a large number of clusters. In this work, clustering performed well when the data formed 4 clusters (4 petrofacies), but badly when the data formed 9 clusters (reservoir classes). In general there needs to be an increased number of data if more clusters are expected, and we define a rule of thumb whereby there should be at least as many independent characteristics being rested than expected clusters.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThis paper presents a study on the clustering efficiency of 8 machine learning clustering methods with a large database (N\u00a0=\u00a0307) of five carbonate facies. The facies were the Base Bed, Whit Bed and Hard Blue bed of the Portland limestone, the Purbeck Button Bed and the Solnhofen limestone. A wide range of petrophysical tests were carried out and have been analysed in detail prior to machine learning testing.\nUp to five independent attributes were selected for clustering tests. A total of 990 tests were carried out to examine (i) the efficacy of 8 clustering methods, (ii) the effect of using each of the 31 different combinations of attribute available, and (iii) the effect of leaving the target number of clusters undefined or each of 11 defined cluster numbers.\nWe find that the Expectation Maximisation (EM) performs best on our petrophysical data, with the Kmeans approach with both Euclidean and Manhattan distance models coming a creditable second and third. The other methods tested in this work did not provide results of sufficient quality to allow us to recommend them for use with petrophysical data.\nGood clustering requires the attribute set to be chosen carefully, with pre-implementation tuning to ensure good performance. It is clear that the adage that more data is always better does not work. We found that often the use of a limited number of good attributes was better than using a larger set of attributes. We associate this observation with the idea that some attributes (porosity in this work) are more powerful than others in separating data into clusters, while other attributes (FFI in this work) can degrade clustering efficiency if included in the attribute set. However, the efficacy of any given attribute will probably vary from dataset to dataset.\nClustering performance of a set of attributes in one dataset will be different than that in another. Here we see that clustering performance is different in the larger combined dataset than the Portland dataset.\nIt can be effective to let the clustering method automatically recognise the number of clusters required for the data. Indeed it provided the best clustering in this study. However, it is only effective when the number of independent attributes is equal to or greater than the number of clusters existing in the dataset. It is probably better to pre-define the number of target clusters if it is possible to do so.\nFinally, we propose a rule-of-thumb that the number of independent attributes should be at least the same as the number of expected clusters, and preferably more.\nThe conclusions drawn from earlier in the work have been applied to the problem of facies recognition by clustering using a set of wireline logs. We find that clustering is capable of recognising major facies boundaries providing the number of independent wireline logs used as attributes exceeds the number of facies in the well.\n\n","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe pre-salt section of the Santos Basin is one of the largest offshore petroleum discoveries in the world in the last two decades (Carminatti et al., 2008; Beltr\u00e3o et al., 2009; Chakhmakhchev and Rushworth, 2010; Jones and Chaves, 2011, 2015; Arbouille et al., 2013; Petersohn, 2019; Abelha and Petersohn, 2019). This discovery is remarkable due to the large volumes of resource in-place, the high reservoir productivity, the thick, broad, high-quality seal (mainly composed of halite, gypsum and anhydrite), and the presence of high-quality oil (approximate API gravity 28\u201330\u00b0). Following this discovery, Brazil became a net oil exporter, changing the geopolitics in South America (Priest, 2016). Numerous estimates of the petroleum resource potential of the pre-salt reservoirs have been published by universities and specialized companies with numbers ranging from 22 to 300 billion barrels equivalent in place (Chakhmakhchev and Rushworth, 2010; Jones and Chaves, 2011, 2015; Schenk et al., 2012; Arbouille et al., 2013). Currently, there are fourteen fields in production in the pre-salt section of the Santos Basin, totaling a mean production of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels website database \u2013 August\/2021), with the prospect of a considerable increase in the next five years (Petersohn, 2019; Abelha and Petersohn, 2019).\nDespite the nearly two decades since the first wells were drilled (RJS-617 and RJS-628), some doubts persist related to some particular aspects of the petroleum systems in the pre-salt section, such as migration pathways, hydrocarbon potential of secondary kitchen areas, and CO2 and H2S risks. To address part of these open questions, several studies have been published on the petroleum systems in the Santos Basin based on the geochemistry of the oil and gas in the post-salt reservoirs (Gibbons et al., 1983; Schiefelbein et al., 2000; Chang et al., 2008; Dickson et al., 2019), and the geochemistry of the oils in the pre-salt reservoirs has been reported on by Barbanti et al. (2013), Guzzo et al. (2018), Rocha et al. (2019) and Barra et al. (2021).\nThe occurrence of H2S in oil field reservoirs throughout the world is highly variable, reaching concentrations as high as 90% (Orr and Sinninghe Damst\u00e9, 1990; Heydari, 1997; Cross et al., 2004). The H2S content in natural gases is an important factor in exploration risk and economic development assessments due to its high toxicity and corrosivity that require additional investments during drilling, production, and refining processes (Hunt, 1995; Gao et al., 2012; Robertson and Chilingar, 2017; Rezakazemi et al., 2017; Kvarekv\u00e5l and Moloney, 2017; Obot et al., 2019).\nVolatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) are normally associated with H2S and are chemical compounds that contain covalently bonded carbon and sulfur atoms, occur in the gas phase at surface temperature and pressure conditions, and can potentially provide useful information for petroleum system assessments (Cai et al., 2003; Amrani et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Despite the relevance of VOSC to petroleum geochemistry, there are few published studies related to their occurrences in oil fields (Ho et al., 1974; Lyapina and Shmakov, 1989; Haig et al., 1997; Sharipov, 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Kutuzov et al., 2020). It is important to highlight that Ho et al. (1974), Lyapina and Shmakov (1989), and Sharipov (2002) studied the VOSC chemical composition dissolved in produced oils (\u201cdead oil\u201d) and suggest there are losses when compared with gases sampled at reservoir temperature and pressure conditions.\nPrevious studies of VOSC in oil and gas fields have identified thiols, sulfides, thiolanes, and thiophenes (Ho et al., 1974; Lyapina and Shmakov, 1989; Haig et al., 1997; Sharipov, 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Kutuzov et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021). Cai et al. (2003) suggested that it is possible to separate petroleum systems in the Sichuan Basin (China) based on the VOSC composition. These authors pointed out that the thiols were derived from chemical reactions between hydrocarbons and H2S during the thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) process and that the thiophene content correlated with low thermal maturity petroleum. Said-Ahmad et al. (2017) developed a method to analyze the sulfur isotope composition of specific trace sulfur compounds in the gas phase, providing a powerful tool to better understand the occurrence of VOSC in petroleum systems. Amrani et al. (2019) conducted semi-open pyrolysis experiments using a sulfur-rich source rock from the Ghareb Formation (Israel) in order to study the molecular and isotopic variation of VOSC with incremental increases in thermal maturity. This work showed that VOSC could be formed by kerogen decomposition in the early stages of thermal maturation and is associated with H2S-hydrocarbon interactions at later stages. Moreover, these authors proposed that, compared to thiols, thiophenes have \u03b434S values that better reflect those of their original kerogen and\/or bitumen source. According to Amrani et al. (2008) and Zhang et al. (2008), VOSC can catalyze the TSR process, increasing oil field development risk due to the presence of acid gases. Kutuzov et al. (2020) analyzed condensates and gas samples from the Alberta Basin (Canada) to obtain information about the molecular and sulfur isotopic composition of VOSC and polyaromatic compounds (benzo- and dibenzo-thiophenes), and determined that the VOSC were mainly generated by H2S-hydrocarbon interactions. The authors pointed out that the H2S was probably generated by TSR and that the isotopic fractionation between VOSC and H2S (\u223c3\u20134\u2030) can primarily be explained by equilibrium isotope effects. More recently, Xiao et al. (2021) analyzed VOSC distribution in the Jianghan Basin and concluded that gases derived from thermochemical alteration of kerogen are significantly enriched in thiols, sulfides, and alkylated thiophenes and that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) associated gases contain mainly thiols and, in minor proportion, sulfides and alkylated thiophenes.\nThe relative absence of publications that have applied VOSC concentration data to petroleum geology and exploration issues can likely be attributed to the low concentrations of VOSC in petroleum fluids and their susceptibility to chemical reactions, which necessitates special sampling equipment (e.g., sulfur-inert bottles) and techniques. This study aims to present the first detailed molecular and isotope composition data for natural gases from the pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin in order to improve our understanding of the genesis of petroleum accumulations (e.g., source, formation process, thermal maturity, secondary alteration, and filling history) in this region. Additionally, we present the most comprehensive dataset of VOSC composition in petroleum fluids published to date, with the intent of evaluating the effectiveness of VOSC geochemistry in constraining petroleum system elements.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe Santos Basin is a passive margin basin located off the southeast coast of Brazil with an area of 350,000\u00a0km2, bounded to the north by the Cabo Frio High and to the south by the Florianopolis High (Fig. 1\n). The Santos Basin is the largest basement depression in the offshore Brazilian region, where sedimentary fill can reach up to 10\u201312\u00a0km in the main depocenter (Pereira and Macedo, 1990). The origin of the Santos Basin is linked to the separation of South America and Africa during the Cretaceous breakup of western Gondwana, followed by seafloor spreading (Bueno, 2004; Moulin et al., 2010; Quirk et al., 2013; Stica et al., 2014). Moreira et al. (2007) divided the stratigraphic record of the Santos Basin into three supersequences: rift, post-rift, and drift (Fig. 2\n). The rift supersequence, of Hauteverian\u2013Aptian age, is composed of extrusive basalts (Cambori\u00fa Formation (Fm.)) and coarse-grained siliciclastic sediments associated with alluvial fans and sandstones, as well as siltstones and shales related to lacustrine deposits (Pi\u00e7arras and Itapema Fms.). The post-rift supersequence, of Aptian age, is constituted by siliciclastic sediments along the basin margins and carbonate sediments in distal deep-water regions (Barra Velha Fm.), both followed by a thick sequence of evaporitic rocks (Ariri Fm.). The drift supersequence, from Albian to Pliocene age, is composed of 19 sequences (Moreira et al., 2007). The Albian sequence is characterized by proximal facies linked to alluvial and deltaic fans and shallow carbonate platforms in distal settings. After the Albian sequence, open marine siliciclastic deposition occurred, which was modulated by periodic regional uplift of the onshore Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira coastal ranges (Cobbold et al., 2001; Saenz et al., 2003) and successions of rising and falling sea level. Eight magmatic events were identified during the geological evolution of the Santos Basin (Oureiro, 2006; Moreira et al., 2007), three of which occur in the pre-salt section (130\u00a0Ma ? 121\u2013130\u00a0Ma, and 118\u00a0Ma).\nThe pre-salt petroleum system comprises lacustrine source rock intervals within the rift supersequence and carbonate reservoirs of the Barra Velha and Itapema formations (Freitas et al., 2019). Total organic carbon (TOC) content of the source rocks in the rift supersequence ranges from 2 to 6\u00a0wt %, with associated hydrogen index values up to 900\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC (Freitas et al., 2019). According to Chang et al. (2008), the petroleum generation and expulsion processes started close to 100\u00a0Ma, with the peak of oil generation around 90\u201370\u00a0Ma. The shallower burial depths and lower heat flow, coupled with the high thermal conductivity of the overlying evaporites, allowed source rocks on the so-called \u201cExternal High\u201d to remain in the oil window, in some areas until the present day, whereas equivalent source rocks in the deeper, central part of the basin are now in the gas window or overmature (Mello et al., 2009). Nevertheless, Gelman et al. (2016) carried out petroleum system modeling in the Santos Basin and suggested that the source rock in the External High of the Santos Basin tends to be immature. Rocha et al. (2019) carried out a geochemical characterization of oils from a pre-salt field in the Santos Basin (Mero Field) and suggested that the source rock was deposited in a lacustrine environment, probably associated with the Itapema Fm. (Jiqui\u00e1 Stage).\nThe External High of the Santos Basin is an important basement high in the central part of the S\u00e3o Paulo Plateau with a SW-NE orientation that shows gravity anomalies and has an approximate area of 1500\u00a0km2 (Fig. 3\n; Gomes et al., 2002; Carminatti et al., 2008). Part of the External High was probably subaerially exposed during Aptian times, with both rift and sag sections pinched-out against the high, and its crest apparently covered directly by the evaporitic sequence (Gomes et al., 2002). The \u201cexternal kitchen\u201d is an informal name for the rift section located east of the External High (Fig. 3).\nThe main reservoir of the pre-salt petroleum system is the Barra Velha Fm. Of the Aptian section, which is unconformably overlain by the evaporites of the Ariri Fm. and unconformably overlies the Barremian (Itapema Fm.), which is a relatively minor reservoir. The discussion of the origin of the carbonate reservoirs in the Barra Velha Fm. is still open. Some papers invoke a microbial origin (Carminatti et al., 2008; Terra et al., 2010; Ahr et al., 2011), but there are many other authors that suggest an abiotic process associated with hydrothermal degassing and hot springs (Wright and Barnett, 2015; Herlinger et al., 2017; Souza et al., 2018; Lima and De Ros, 2019; Farias et al., 2019).\nMany authors have described the occurrence of acid gases (CO2 and H2S) in pre-salt reservoirs (Almeida et al., 2010; Melo et al., 2011; Santos Neto et al., 2012, 2013; Ferraz et al., 2019). According to Santos Neto et al. (2013), H2S in the Santos Basin is related to TSR and was generated in deeper parts of the basin and migrated to pre-salt reservoirs.\n\n\n3\nMaterial and analytical methods\nSixty-four downhole fluid samples were taken in order to investigate the reservoir fluid composition in 17 wells from Barra Velha and Itapema Fm. reservoirs in four oil fields (Fields A, C, D, and E) and one sub-commercial oil occurrence (Field B). The names of the wells are coded, and their locations are not provided in this paper due to confidentiality. A naming convention was created to name each sample where the first letter is related to the field, the first digit corresponds to the well number in each field and the second digit is the sample number in each well (e.g., D2-4 \u2013 Field D, well 2, sample 4). The second digit of each well is organized according to the depth of the samples. General information about the fluids of the studied fields are presented in Table 1\n.\nSingle-phase petroleum samples were collected at reservoir pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) conditions in Sulfinert\u00ae coated stainless steel cylinders to minimize chemical reactions between VOSC and steel. After flash release of the petroleum fluid, corresponding gas-phase samples were collected in Tedlar\u00ae bags with polypropylene fittings, transported to the gas chromatography lab, and analyzed in less than 24\u00a0h. Tedlar\u00ae bags have been shown to effectively preserve ppm concentrations of VOSC for a minimum of several days (ASTM D5504-12; Suyok et al., 2002; Mochalski et al., 2009; Kasper et al., 2018). Internal tests of this sampling procedure confirmed that the concentrations of VOSC in a standard sample were within the precision of the analytical measurements (<0.2\u00a0ppm).\nThe chemical characterization of the major gas compounds (H2, N2, CO2, C1\u2013C4) was performed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors. A fused-silica capillary column (J&W GS-GasPro, 60\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.32\u00a0mm) was used to separate the target compounds. The GC oven temperature was initially cooled to \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C using liquid nitrogen and ramped to \u221267\u00a0\u00b0C at 4\u00a0\u00b0C\/minute (min); then a heating rate of 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/min was applied until reaching 150\u00a0\u00b0C, holding for 1\u00a0min. Finally, the oven was heated at 35\u00a0\u00b0C\/min to 200\u00a0\u00b0C and held at this temperature for 3.6\u00a0min. Compositions were reported in molar percentages and calibrated against a certified natural gas mixture (Air Liquide \u2013 Certificate 10.517 \u2013 Compounds: n-C4, i-C4, C3, C2, CO2, N2, He, H2, C1 \u2013 Relative Precision 1% - detection limit 500\u00a0ppm \u2013 internal calibration). The carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios were measured using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a Thermo Fisher Scientific Delta V Plus mass spectrometer via a combustion Conflo IV interface. \u03b413C and \u03b42H values were obtained for all hydrocarbons, from methane to butane, as well as the \u03b413C values for CO2. Carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions are reported in per mil (\u2030) against Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB) and Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), respectively. Bulk carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions were calibrated with natural gas standards for stable isotope analyses provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS-HCG-1, USGS-HCG-2, USGS-HCG-3 - Ellis and Dias, 2022). The typical precision is within \u00b10.5\u2030 and \u00b15\u2030 for \u03b413C and \u03b42H values, respectively.\nAn Agilent 7890\u00a0A gas chromatograph, equipped with a sulfur chemiluminescence detector (SCD, Agilent 355 Sulfur), was used to measure the VOSC molecular composition. The sample introduction system was built such that all parts in contact with the sample were either stainless steel coated with Sulfinert\u00ae or made of Teflon\u00ae. An HP-1 GC column (50\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.2\u00a0mm x 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm) was used and helium was applied as the carrier gas in constant flow mode. The GC oven temperature was initially set to 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, and then ramped to 220\u00a0\u00b0C at 20\u00a0\u00b0C\/min (held for 30\u00a0min). Regarding precision and bias, the reader is referred to the detailed description of the American Society for Testing and Materials general procedure (ASTM, 2004), on which the method used in this study was based. Sensitivity was typically less than 5\u00a0pg\u00a0S\/s. A typical chromatogram of a gas sample is shown in Fig. 4\n. Note that H2S and carbonyl sulfide COS were not fully separated from each other, and base-valley and valley-base integrations were respectively adopted in this case. The method was configured to identify 23 sulfur compounds (Fig. 4). Calibration was performed by using an electrochemical H2S generator (Cal2000 - Advanced Calibration Designs Inc., USA), which was able to deliver H2S in the range of 0.5\u201350\u00a0ppm.\nStatistical analyses were performed with the software PAST 3.22, developed by the University of Oslo (Hammer et al., 2001). Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were applied to understand the relations among variables and the similarities between the natural gas samples to support the geological interpretation. PCA may be used for the reduction of a data set to a few variables for plotting purposes. Variance-covariance was used to create the correlation matrix from the PCA because the variables are in the same unit (ppm by volume). For the statistical assessment, we only selected the compounds with identification in all samples (\u22650.1\u00a0ppm), with the exception of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), Ethyl-Methyl-Sulfide (EMS) and Diethyl Sulfide (DES).\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nBulk molecular composition\nThe molecular composition of the gases, excluding the sulfur components, are listed in Table 2\n. The non-hydrocarbon gases are mainly constituted by CO2, and the concentrations vary significantly among the studied samples, ranging from 19.7 up to 68\u00a0mol % (Fig. 5\n). The N2, H2 and He concentrations can be considered negligible. Regarding the hydrocarbon gases, the dryness [C1\/(C1+C2+C3+C4)] ranges from 0.77 to 0.86, where Field B presents the highest values of dryness and the greatest concentration of CO2 (mean values of 0.85 and 67.9\u00a0mol %, respectively, Fig. 5). The C2\/C3, C2\/i-C4 and C3\/C4 ratios have been applied to evaluate the thermal maturation of the hydrocarbon gases (Lorant et al., 1998; Prinzhofer et al., 2000a, 2000b; Santos Neto, 2004; Peng et al., 2019) and range from 1.49 to 2.02, 8.92 to 13.25 and 1.79 to 3.99, respectively (Table 2).\n\n\n4.2\nCarbon and hydrogen isotope ratios (\u03b413C and \u03b42H)\nThe \u03b413C and \u03b42H data for C1\u2013C4 are presented in Table 3\n. The \u03b413C C1 and \u03b42H C1 values vary significantly, ranging from \u221239.8 to \u221230.2\u2030 and \u2212157 to \u2212131\u2030, respectively. The gases from Field B present the heaviest \u03b413C C1 and \u03b42H C1 values. The \u03b413C CO2 values vary from \u22123.7\u2030 to \u22126.0\u2030, with an average of \u22124.8\u2030 and standard deviation of 0.5\u2030.\n\n\n4.3\nH2S and VOSC distribution\nCompared to the other gaseous components, H2S and VOSC concentrations are low, reaching maximum values of 65.9 and 23.9 ppmV, respectively (Table 4\n). However, these concentrations are sufficiently high to characterize the studied fields of the Santos Basin as sour, according to NACE MR0175 (National Association of Corrosion Engineers). The highest H2S values are observed in Field A (Fig. 5, Table 4, and Table A - Supplementary Material). Figs. 5 and 6\n show the VOSC chemical composition of the gases in the studied area. Even though the VOSC analytical method used in this study can identify 23 VOSC, only 7 compounds are present at concentrations above the detection limit in the studied samples. COS concentration ranges from 0.1 up to 5.6 ppmV, and the highest values are observed in Field A. The organic sulfides are mainly composed of DES and DMS and are quite low in the studied samples (<0.2\u00a0ppm by volume). The main thiol compound is ethanethiol. The cyclic VOSC are primarily composed of thiophene, and the branched thiophenes are negligible (<0.1\u00a0ppm by volume). The 2-propanethiol is the major isomer among the propanethiol compounds. Diethyl-di-tert-butyl-S is present at a low concentration (\u22640.1\u00a0ppm by volume) and was only identified in Field B.\n\n\n4.4\nStatistics\n\n4.4.1\nPearson's correlation coefficient\nPearson's correlation coefficient was applied to investigate the correlation between the variables. Only the VOSC with average values higher than 0.4\u00a0ppm by volume were selected to run the Pearson's correlation. We consider a strong correlation to be associated with values above +0.65 and below \u22120.65. A strong positive correlation is observed between H2S, COS, and methanethiol (MeSH) (Table B - Appendix data). The total amount of VOSC presents a strong correlation with DES, C2\u2013C3 thiols, thiophene, and methane. To assist with the data interpretation, we classify VOSC according to their affinity with H2S. All VOSC with more than one carbon are classified as \u201cmulti-carbon\u201d and tend to present a strong positive correlation among them. We classify COS and MeSH as \u201csingle-carbon\u201d VOSC due to their strong positive correlation with H2S.\n\n\n4.4.2\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA was carried out to help understand the similarities between the samples based only on the VOSC chemical composition. The first three principal components (PC) account for 93.2% of the variability in the data set. Table 5\n presents the loadings values that comprise each principal component. PC-1 is mainly linked to multi-carbon thiols and DES. PC-2 separated the samples with a higher affinity with COS and MeSH (single-carbon VOCS). PC-3 is mainly indicative of samples with high thiophene content. PCA allows the identification of eight different groups of VOSC compositions that align well with the origin of the samples, as discussed below (Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe origin of hydrocarbon gases and CO2\n\nGas geochemistry is an important tool for understanding petroleum systems that can provide information about generation processes (thermogenic, biogenic, and abiogenic), gas source and its thermal maturity, and secondary alteration processes (e.g., biodegradation, TSR, etc.) (Schoell, 1983; Hunt, 1995; Prinzhofer et al., 2000b; Santos Neto, 2004; Milkov and Etiope, 2018). Additionally, understanding the origin of hydrocarbon gases and CO2 in their geologic context is a key factor for interpreting the origin of VOSC and H2S in pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin, as well as evaluating the possible applications of these data to petroleum systems assessments. The molecular and stable isotopic (\u03b413C and \u03b42H) compositions of the hydrocarbon gases in the studied samples support the interpretation of thermogenic origin. Recently, Milkov and Etiope (2018) updated and modified the plot of \u03b413C versus \u03b42H of methane first proposed by Whiticar et al. (1986) and later revised by Whiticar (1999), and the plot of the pre-salt reservoir gases indicates that these gases were generated during the transition from the oil-associated to the late-mature gas stages (Fig. 8\n). However, data from the liquid and the C2+ gas fractions indicate that the fluids were generated at a lower maturation stage (Fig. 9\n). Hydrocarbon liquids generated at the oil to gas transition stage would be expected to be condensates; however, Field B contains lighter oil with a mean API gravity of 37.1\u00b0 and the other fields contain black oils with mean API gravities ranging from 21.1 to 27.4\u00b0 (Table 1). The plot of the difference between the carbon isotopic composition of ethane and propane (\u03b413C C2 \u2013 \u03b413C C3) versus the ethane\/propane ratio (C2\/C3) can provide information related to the thermal maturity of the source of gas (Lorant et al., 1998), and these data suggest that the hydrocarbon gases (C2+) in the pre-salt reservoirs were generated during the oil window (primary cracking \u2013 Fig. 9). Additionally, comparison of the C2\/C3, C2\/i-C4, and C3\/C4 ratios with data from previous studies of petroleum accumulations (Prinzhofer et al., 2000b; Peng et al., 2019) and pyrolysis experiments (Lorant et al., 1998; Spigolon et al., 2015) suggests that the C2+ fraction was generated within the oil window. This apparent contradiction between the interpretations based on the C1 and C2+ fractions could be the result of mixtures of different fluids with different thermal maturities, variations in the organic facies of the gas sources (different depocenters or different drainages affecting specific areas within one large depocenter), secondary alteration processes, or a combination of these factors.\nThe plot of stable carbon isotopic composition versus the reciprocal of the carbon number (1\/C\nn\n) for C1 to C4 hydrocarbons can be used to identify cogenetic gases, where samples plotting along a straight line are interpreted to have a source isotopic composition and thermal maturity related to the y-intercept and slope of the line, respectively (Chung et al., 1988). To test the notion that some pre-salt reservoir gases may contain an additional mature-gas charge, the mean carbon isotopic values for the C1\u2013C4 hydrocarbons from each of the studied fields were plotted against 1\/C\nn\n (Fig. 10\n). Hydrocarbon gases in each of the individual fields are cogenetic (formed from the same source and level of thermal maturity), except for Field B where the mean \u03b413C C1 value is heavier than expected based on a linear extrapolation of the \u03b413C C2\u2013C4 values. The results show no evidence for mixtures between gases with different thermal maturities in Fields A, C, D, and E, supporting the interpretation that the relatively heavier \u03b413C and \u03b42H C1 values in these fields are related to the isotopic signature of the source (i.e., organic facies) and that the gases were generated within the oil window. Although the revisions made to the \u03b413C-\u03b42H of C1 interpretive scheme by Milkov and Etiope (2018) are based on a substantially larger database compared to the previous interpretations (Whiticar et al., 1986; Whiticar, 1999), none of these studies attempted to distinguish marine and lacustrine sourced gases within the broad distribution of thermogenic gases. Cerqueira et al. (2008) conducted pyrolysis experiments on precipitated asphaltenes from lacustrine and marine oils to investigate the isotopic signature (\u03b413C and \u03b42H) of methane generated by each type of source rock. These authors concluded that the methane derived from lacustrine oils presented \u03b42H values heavier than methane generated from marine oil. This observation could be the explanation for the heavy \u03b42H C1 values observed in the studied natural gas samples, leading to an over-estimation of the maturity of the gas source using the interpretive scheme of Milkov and Etiope (2018). Additionally, the oil compositions support the interpretation that associated gases were generated within the oil window (Table 1).\nThe occurrence of 13C-enriched methane in the gases from Field B could be an indication of an input of a high-maturity dry thermogenic gas or possibly a contribution of abiotic methane. A portion of the gases in Field B are likely derived from the external kitchen of the Santos Basin and\/or in situ generation due to the geographic proximity and presence of structural conduits. This region contains intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks and also wells with natural gases containing high concentrations of CO2 (Szatmari and Milani, 2016; Gamboa et al., 2019). As an example, there are some strong reflectors in the pre-salt section that can be interpreted as igneous intrusions and\/or lava spills in the seismic sections presented by Valente (2018). The origin of CO2 cannot be determined based only on the \u03b413C composition of CO2 (Thrasher and Fleet, 1995; Wycherley et al., 1999). Previous studies have indicated a mantle origin for the CO2 in the pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin, based on the \u03b413C composition of CO2 and the molecular and isotopic composition of associated noble gases (Santos Neto et al., 2012; Ferraz et al., 2019). Additionally, basin models suggest a possible low transformation ratio (up to the end of oil the window) for the lacustrine source rock in the external kitchen of the Santos Basin (Chang et al., 2008; Contreras, 2011; Gelman et al., 2016). Within this context, the hypothesis of a dry-gas charge derived from overmature source rock in the external kitchen developed as a result of regional burial processes seems unlikely. Consequently, the 13C-enriched methane could be explained by an atypical petroleum system related to the thermal influence of igneous intrusions (Cerqueira et al., 1999) or possibly a deep, abiotic source (Sherwood Lollar et al., 1997). The occurrence of igneous intrusions close to the source rock intervals in the external kitchen area makes the localized petroleum system a reasonable interpretation for the source of the heavy methane. Moreover, the volume of 13C-enriched methane required to produce the observed \u03b413C values in Field B would be quite large for an abiotic source. However, an unequivocal source for the 13C-enriched methane in this field cannot be established at this time and more studies are needed to solve this question.\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin of H2S and VOSC\nThe origin of H2S in petroleum reservoirs can be attributed to many processes: TSR, MSR, thermal decomposition of organic sulfur compounds (OSCs), kerogen cracking, hydrothermal fluids, and pyrite dissolution (Orr, 1977; Eden et al., 1993; Aplin and Coleman, 1995; Machel, 2001; Alberdi-Genolet et al., 2013; Amrani et al., 2019). The H2S generation process in Santos Basin is still controversial because the hottest reservoirs are relatively cold for TSR (around 90\u2013105\u00a0\u00b0C), and it is not possible to predict H2S observations based on the migration pathways. The H2S concentration is generally lower than 100 ppmV, and the \u03b434S values for H2S are quite similar to the \u03b434S of anhydrites (Santos Neto et al., 2013). Moreover, it is necessary to investigate the \u03b434S composition of other potential sources of H2S, such as kerogens and oils, to thoroughly investigate the origin of all H2S occurences in the Santos Basin. Although the occurrence of TSR in the Santos Basin is uncertain, we adopt the model proposed by Santos Neto et al. (2013) to interpret the gas geochemistry from Field A, where H2S is presumed to have been generated by TSR in the deep kitchen and migrated to the shallower pre-salt reservoirs. Validation of this interpretation requires the acquisition of additional data (e.g., compound-specific sulfur isotopes, thiadiamondoid concentrations, etc.), which is beyond the scope of this study. The samples from Field A contain the highest H2S concentrations of any of the studied fields, ranging from 21 to 66 ppmV. Additionally, the COS\/sulfides and C1\/(C2+C3) thiols ratios are the highest in Field A gases (Fig. 11\n). In contrast, the other fields (B, C, D and E) present relatively low H2S concentrations, generally lower than 15 ppmV, and do not show any relation to migration pathways from the possible source area of H2S. Consequently, we interpret the very low H2S concentration in gases from fields B, C, D, and E to have been generated by kerogen cracking related to oil generation (Rosenberg et al., 2017; Amrani et al., 2019).\nIn general, VOSC concentrations are lower than 15 ppmV throughout the studied fields, except for Field B where the values vary from 18 to 24 ppmV (Fig. 5B). Total VOSC contents do not show a strong Pearson's correlation with H2S concentrations, suggesting that the origin of some VOSC is not substantially related to the H2S formation processes or occurrences (Fig. 5B and Table B \u2013 Supplementary Data). Field-based studies of oils and natural gases have suggested that organic sulfides and thiols are mainly generated by the interaction between hydrocarbons and reduced sulfur species (e.g., elemental sulfur, polysulfides and\/or H2S) rather than directly derived from kerogen or bitumen thermal cracking (Ho et al., 1974; Orr, 1974; Cai et al., 2003; Kutuzov et al., 2020). However, measurements of stable sulfur-isotopic compositions of sulfides and thiols generated in semi-open pyrolysis experiments involving a sulfur-rich source rock indicate a primary generation mechanism for these OSCs (i.e., kerogen cracking) at low thermal maturity with H2S-hydrocarbon reactions becoming dominant at higher maturities (Rosenberg et al., 2017; Amrani et al., 2019). Our data show variations in the Pearson's correlations between H2S and each VOSC.\nThe strong positive Pearson's correlations between H2S, COS, and MeSH suggest that these VOSC were generated by interactions between H2S and hydrocarbons. This implies that the relatively significant amounts of COS and MeSH observed in Field A are likely related to TSR-generated H2S that migrated into the field. Based on the \u03b434S composition of individual S-containing compounds, VOSC in two gas samples from the Alberta Basin (Canada) were interpreted to have formed via interaction with TSR-derived H2S and hydrocarbons (Kutuzov et al., 2020). In one of these gas samples, ethanethiol was the most abundant VOSC, as observed in the gases from the pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin. However, the second gas contained predominantly methanethiol, and laboratory pyrolysis experiments involving one S-rich petroleum source rock have shown methanethiol concentrations to be consistently higher than those of ethanethiol over a range of temperatures (206\u2013412\u00a0\u00b0C) (Amrani et al., 2019). A closed-system pyrolysis study of pentane reacted with H2S at 360\u00a0\u00b0C showed methanethiol concentrations greater than ethanethiol at 4 and 12\u00a0h but the reverse relationship at 72\u00a0h (Meshoulam et al., 2021). The reason for scarcity of methanethiol in the Santos Basin gases is not presently known. Additionally, COS was not reported in either Alberta Basin gas sample despite being the primary VOSC compound correlated with H2S occurrence in the pre-salt gases. COS is reported to be commonly observed in liquified petroleum gases (Svoronos and Bruno, 2002; Andersen and Bruno, 2003), but the formation mechanism in petroleum systems is not understood. Importantly, the H2S concentrations in the Alberta Basin gases were significantly higher than those observed in the Santos Basin (\u223c6\u00a0mol % compared to \u223c0.002\u00a0mol %). H2S and COS can be difficult to separate chromatographically, as shown in ASTM 5504 and Fig. 4, and the higher concentrations of H2S present in the Alberta Basin gases likely obscured the occurrence of COS and precluded its quantification. There are a number of other differences between the Santos and Alberta Basin study areas (e.g., source rock chemistry, gas migration pathways and distances, etc.) that may impact the observed geochemistry of the VOSCs but are beyond the scope of the present study. Ultimately, more data on the molecular and stable sulfur isotopic composition of VOSC in natural gases from a variety of geologic settings are needed to address questions of VOSC formation mechanisms in nature.\nIn contrast to the COS and MeSH results, the sulfides and thiols heavier than MeSH did not present a strong Pearson's correlation with H2S (Table B \u2013 Supplementary Material) and displayed variable molecular compositions among the studied fields (see the definition in 4.4.1). Additionally, these compounds have positive Pearson's correlations among each other, suggesting that the formation process of these compounds could be similar (Table. B \u2013 Supplementary Material). It seems that the concentrations of those multi-carbon thiols and organic sulfides in the studied gases are controlled by organic facies variations rather than source maturity or H2S concentration. Pyrolysis experiments involving sulfur-containing source rocks have shown the generation of thiols, sulfides and thiophene compounds (Rosenberg et al., 2017; Amrani et al., 2019). Although a lacustrine source rock generated the studied gases, it is still possible to infer that VOSC could be derived from the kerogen in the Santos Basin. Mello et al. (1988) classified the sulfur content of the oils in Santos Basin as medium (0.25\u20130.32%) and suggested that the lacustrine source rock was formed under saline conditions, which led to an increase in the sulfur content of the kerogen. The data from Field A support this interpretation due to the relatively high H2S concentrations associated with low concentrations of multi-carbon thiols and sulfides (Fig. 5B). The applicability of these observations to other geologic settings is not known. Equilibrium S-isotopic fractionation observed between thiols-H2S and carbon disulfide-H2S in gases from the Alberta Basin (Canada) were suggested as evidence for generation via H2S-hydrocarbon reactions rather than directly from kerogen (or oil cracking) (Kutuzov et al., 2020). However, the H2S concentrations were significantly higher in these gases compared to the pre-salt reservoir gases. It is possible that higher H2S concentrations lead to a greater extent of H2S-hydrocarbon reactions that result in VOSC distributions that do not reflect an original kerogen (or oil cracking) source. Compound-specific sulfur-isotope analysis of the VOSC in the pre-salt reservoir gases could help to constrain the formation mechanism of these compounds. Additionally, the occurrence of relatively high concentrations of COS in Field A gases may be an indication of current or recent TSR activity. Environmental and refinery studies of COS stability show the propensity for oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2212) or hydrolysis over short time periods (Hewitt and Davison, 1988; McElroy et al., 1980; Svoronos and Bruno, 2002).\nThe concentrations of the thiophenes in the analyzed samples are generally less than 1 ppmV, except in Field B samples. Orr (1974) suggested that the thiophene compounds are formed through the reaction of elemental sulfur and hydrocarbons. Cai et al. (2003) observed that light oils presented higher thiophene concentrations than condensates in the Sichuan Basin (China), suggesting a thermal evolution control. However, these authors concluded that the formation process of thiophenes under geological conditions is unknown. Cai et al. (2003) cites the work of Sheng et al. (1986) when explaining that alkanes might react with H2S or elemental sulfur to generate thiolanes that are thermally unstable, leading to dehydrogenation, and consequently, the formation of thiophenic compounds (Sinninghe Damst\u00e9 et al., 1990). Pyrolysis experiments involving pentane and H2S demonstrate thiophene formation via alkane-H2S reaction at 360\u00a0\u00b0C, and thermodynamic calculations indicate that thiolane formation is only favorable via thiol reaction over a range of temperatures (25\u2013360\u00a0\u00b0C) (Meshoulam et al., 2021). Moreover, Amrani et al. (2019) carried out compound-specific sulfur isotope analyses of gases recovered from pyrolysis experiments involving Ghareb source rock (Israel) samples and concluded that the \u03b434S of the thiophene reflects the kerogen\/bitumen composition. The relatively high concentrations of thiophene in samples from Fields D and E suggest that thiophene could provide a diagnostic signature of specific organic facies because the molecular and isotopic composition of the hydrocarbon gases do not show a substantial difference in thermal maturity (Figs. 8 and 9 - see the discussion in sections 5.1 and 5.3).\nThe chemical composition of OSCs present in Santos Basin source rocks may play a role in determining the molecular composition of VOSC in the gases. Pyrolysis experiments involving a variety of different kerogens (especially variations in organic sulfur content) could be performed to test this hypothesis.\n\n\n5.3\nGas families and VOSC application\nAccording to oil geochemistry studies, all of the petroleum in the pre-salt fields in the Santos Basin is sourced from the brackish lacustrine section of the upper rift supersequence (Itapema Fm.) (Barbanti et al., 2013; Guzzo et al., 2018; Rocha et al., 2019; Barra et al., 2021). However, differences in biomarker data and compound specific isotope analysis of n-alkanes present in these oils have been interpreted as an indication of different source kitchens and\/or migration pathways (Barbanti et al., 2013). There are also some differences in the standard gas geochemistry parameters and VOSC concentrations among the fields examined in this study that are consistent with this interpretation of geologic control on petroleum geochemistry.\n\nFig. 10F shows the reciprocal of the carbon number versus the average of the \u03b413C composition for C1\u2013C4 for the five fields studied, from which the inferred \u03b413C composition of the kerogen source (y-intercept) and its thermal maturity (slope) can be used to interpret different gas families. The co-alignment of the data from Fields A and D suggests that these gases have a similar origin (source rock interval, oil kitchen, and migration pathway), which is supported by the observation that they lie along the same migration pathway within the basin (Family \u03b1). The PCA analysis based on VOSC composition separates these fields due to the higher multi-carbon thiols and DES and lower COS concentrations in Field D gases (Fig. 7 and Table 5), which according to the proposed model for the H2S generation process in the Santos Basin was the only field that received TSR-derived H2S. The CO2 concentrations of Field D gases are slightly higher than those of Field A (Table 2, Fig. 5), supporting the notion that the oil migration pathway is not the only control on CO2 concentration. Moreover, the PCA identifies a secondary group in Field A that represents the samples with higher COS and MeSH that are closest to the main oil kitchen for the reservoirs of the pre-salt section of the Santos Basin (Fig. 7 \u2013 Group A2) and are located in the hottest area in the field (\u223c100\u00a0\u00b0C). Although production data show the reservoirs in Field A to be well-connected, the H2S concentration does not seem to be homogeneous, suggesting that the TSR reaction is still occurring (i.e., recent charge). There are two samples from Field D that contain different VOSC compositions and higher H2S concentrations when compared to the other samples of the field (Fig. 7 \u2013 Group D2 and Fig. 11). Santos Neto et al. (2013) showed that it is possible to find wells with relatively high H2S concentrations in fields with low mean H2S concentrations in the pre-salt reservoirs. These authors associated these relatively higher H2S occurrences to hydrothermal fluids that lead to localized TSR reactions. The elevated COS and MeSH concentrations in these two samples from Field D support this hypothesis (Figs. 7 and 11).\nThe average carbon isotope values for gases from Fields B and C are co-aligned on the plot of the reciprocal of the carbon number versus the \u03b413C composition for C1\u2013C4 (Fig. 10F), suggesting that the hydrocarbon gases have a similar origin (i.e., oil kitchen and migration pathway \u2013 Families \u03b2 and \u03b4). However, compared to Field C, Field B contains more 13C-enriched methane (as well as slightly more ethane) and a greater amount of CO2 (Fig. 5A), which could be interpreted to be due to an additional charge of high thermal maturity gas (Family \u03b4), probably associated with an atypical petroleum system, and forms the basis for characterizing these as distinct gas families. Fields B and C are close to each other (\u223c15\u00a0km), but Field B is near the edge of the External High of the Santos Basin and is more susceptible to receiving fluids from the external kitchen. The PCA shows significant compositional differences between gases from Fields B and C. Field B contains the highest total VOSC concentrations of the studied samples with a unique composition, characterized by a relatively higher concentration of thiophenes and multi-carbon sulfides and thiols, supporting the interpretation of a charge contribution from the external kitchen. The difference in the API gravity of the oils in Fields B (avg.\u00a0=\u00a037.1\u00b0) and C (avg.\u00a0=\u00a027.4\u00b0) is mainly attributed to the excess CO2 and methane in Field B, which has led to the formation of a gas cap.\nThe plot of the reciprocal of the carbon number versus the average \u03b413C composition for C1\u2013C4 from Field E shows a high degree of linearity (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9924) (Fig. 10D), and a slight difference from all of the other fields in terms of slope and intercept (Fig. 10F \u2013 Family \u03b5). The Chung plot of the Field E could be ascribed to small differences in the \u03b413C composition of the precursor and a level of thermal maturity that is greater than that of Fields A and D (average slope\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-16.5) and less than that of Fields B and C (average slope\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-10.4) or to slight differences in the kinetic isotope effect related to organic facies of the source kerogen. To test these hypotheses, we evaluated the correlations among the \u03b413C C1\u2013C4 and \u03b42H C1\u2013C4 values for all fields. Fig. 12\n (A, C, and E) shows that the \u03b413C C1\u2013C4 values of the gases in Fields E are lighter than those in Field C and are aligned, suggesting lower thermal maturity and the same gas family. However, the \u03b42H C1 values of the gases in Field E are heavier than those of Field C (Fig. 12 - B). Moreover, the gases in Fields E and C have similar gas dryness (Fig. 5A) and \u03b42H values for C2 and C4 (Fig. 12 - B, D and F), which is not consistent with the notion of lower thermal maturity gases in Field E. Therefore, the most plausible interpretation is that the observed differences in the geochemistry of the gases from Field E are the result of differences in the organic facies of the source rock, which is further supported by the oil geochemistry data presented in Table 1 (API, GOR, GAM\/H30 and Phy\/n-C18). Additionally, the composition of the VOSC in Field E is different from the other gas families, due to the relatively high concentration of multi-carbon sulfides and moderate concentrations of thiols associated with a low H2S concentration (Figs. 5\u20137 and 11). Field E is located in the southern area of the pre-salt reservoirs, and therefore it is difficult to envision a shared migration pathway with fluids charged in Field C.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis is the first publication that examines the geochemistry of natural gases in the pre-salt reservoirs of the Santos Basin. Additionally, this study presents the most detailed and comprehensive dataset related to VOSC in natural gases associated with conventional petroleum reservoirs. The conclusions drawn from this study are:\n\n\u2022\nThe hydrocarbon gases were generated by thermogenic processes during the oil window stage and are sourced from a brackish lacustrine source rock (Itapema Fm.).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe \u03b413C C1 values are slightly heavier than would be expected for the inferred maturity, which is interpreted to be the result of the lacustrine organic precursors, with the exception of the Field B gases. The 13C-enriched C1 values observed in Field B are thought to be due to a charge of a high thermal maturity methane-rich fluid from the external kitchen of the Santos Basin and\/or in situ generation, probably associated with an atypical petroleum system.\n\n\n\u2022\nFour gas families were recognized based on the molecular and stable isotopic composition of hydrocarbon gases (molar and isotope data) and supported by VOSC composition (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 and \u03b5). The gas families were directly related to different source kitchens and\/or migration pathways.\n\n\n\u2022\nTotal VOSC concentrations in the reservoirs of the pre-salt section of the Santos Basin are generally low, not exceeding 24\u00a0ppm by volume, and show compositional changes associated with organic facies variations in the source rock and secondary alteration processes such as TSR.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur data suggest that the main mechanisms of COS and MeSH generation are associated with H2S-hydrocarbon interactions (sulfurization). Isotopic studies may confirm this COS generation hypothesis.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe heterogeneity of the H2S concentration across Field A provides evidence that the H2S was recently generated. On the other hand, the main generation process of multi-carbon sulfides and thiols seems to be associated with kerogen cracking, and consequently, organic facies variations control the molecular composition of these compounds.\n\n\n\u2022\nThiophene concentrations for the studied gas samples do not show a correlation with maturation and seem to be controlled by organic facies.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe results suggest that the COS\/sulfides and C1\/(C2+C3) thiols ratios can be used as a proxy to identify minor TSR alteration of petroleum fluids.\n\n\n\nAs is the case with other non-hydrocarbon gases, this study has shown that the distribution of VOSC in natural gases can provide additional information to support and refine petroleum system assessments. However, the data examined in this study are restricted to gas families associated with a single source rock interval and contain relatively low H2S concentrations. To further validate these findings, it will be necessary to examine VOSC distributions and sulfur isotopic composition in petroleum reservoirs associated with a variety of different source rock intervals, thermal maturities, reservoir temperatures, and H2S generation processes (e.g., kerogen cracking, TSR, and MSR).\n\n","54":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nExtensional margins are characterized by a wide range of crustal architectures, where the arrangement of continental, transitional, and oceanic domains are complex and variable (e.g., Tucholke et al., 2007; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009; Monteleone et al., 2020). Interpretations of modern seismic reflection data (e.g., Gillard et al., 2019; Lymer et al., 2019; Cawood et al., 2021a), constraints from deep sea drilling campaigns (e.g., Larsen et al., 2018), seismic velocity modeling (e.g., Funck et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2018), and gravity inversion (Welford et al., 2012, 2020; Kusznir et al., 2020) among other approaches, have improved our ability to distinguish between crustal domains and characterize extended margins, particularly at the conjugate margins of Newfoundland-Iberia.\nUnderstanding the architecture and evolution of transform margins remains challenging because (i) deformation is commonly oblique in these settings, which leads to complex juxtapositions of sedimentary units (e.g., Basile and Braun, 2016; Loncke et al., 2016, 2020), (ii) flexural uplift and erosion may obscure depositional patterns (e.g., Basile and Allemand, 2002), (iii) strike-slip faults are typically difficult to recognize in seismic data, which leads to underestimations of lateral displacement (e.g., Richard et al., 1995), and (iv) multiple phases of faulting may occur through progressive structural evolution (Basile, 2015). Further, there remain uncertainties regarding configurations of crustal domains at transform margins where significant age discontinuities exist between continental, transitional, and oceanic crust (e.g., Mascle and Blarez, 1987; Kusznir et al., 2020), and distinct crustal domains are apparently juxtaposed across relatively narrow zones (e.g., Todd et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 2003).\nCharacterizing the crustal structure of transform margins and comparing rifted margin vs. transform margin architectures is clearly important for understanding processes of continental rifting and breakup. While rifted margins have been extensively studied on the conjugate margins of the North Atlantic (e.g., Pereira and Alves, 2012; Davy et al., 2016; Welford et al., 2012; Cawood et al., 2021b) and many models proposed for their development (e.g., Mohn et al., 2015; Peace and Welford, 2020), relatively little is known about crustal configurations and structural development at associated transform margins (e.g., the southern Newfoundland transform margin; Todd et al., 1988). Where the structure of transform margins has been investigated, either using geophysical methods (e.g., Edwards et al., 1997; Sage et al., 2000; Boone et al., 2021) or from direct observation at the Earth's surface (e.g., Guiraud et al., 2010), these zones have been shown to be complex. In spite of this complexity, transform margins are generally depicted in global plate reconstructions (e.g., M\u00fcller et al., 2008; Nirrengarten et al., 2018) as relatively linear, abrupt discontinuities between crustal domains.\nThe southern Newfoundland margin (Fig. 1\n) has been interpreted as a prominent transform margin that juxtaposes the relatively intact continental crust of the Grand Banks with the adjacent Fogo Basin (e.g., Funck et al., 2004; Welford and Hall, 2007, Fig. 2\n). We interpret newly available 2D seismic data across this region (Fig. 1), and investigate crustal structure across the southern Newfoundland transform margin, Fogo Basin, Grand Banks, Newfoundland Ridge, and southern Salar Basin (Fig. 1). We show that (i) the Newfoundland Ridge and parts of the Fogo Basin are underlain by extended continental crust, (ii) evaporite diapirs are present across much of the area, and (iii) our kinematic restoration results are consistent with published ages of rifting and breakup across the Scotian and Newfoundland margins. These results challenge generally accepted depictions of (i) the southern Newfoundland transform margin as a linear, abrupt juxtaposition of oceanic and continental domains, and (ii) the Newfoundland Ridge as part of the oceanic domain.\n\n\n2\nTectonic and stratigraphic framework\n\n2.1\nPre-rift continental crust\nAccretion of several terranes along the Canadian Atlantic margin occurred as a result of multiple orogenic events (Taconian, Acadian, and Alleghanian) throughout the Paleozoic (e.g., Pe-Piper and Jansa, 1999; Waldron et al., 2019). Continental lithosphere beneath the Scotian margin is primarily made up of Cambrian-Ordovician metasedimentary rocks and Devonian intrusives of the Meguma terrane (Jansa and Wade, 1975; Jansa et al., 1993; Pe-Piper and Jansa, 1999). Paleozoic metasedimentary basement rocks of the Gondwanan Avalon terrane constitute continental crust beneath the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and much of the Grand Banks, offshore Newfoundland (e.g., King et al., 1985; Waldron et al., 2019, Fig. 2).\n\n\n2.2\nTriassic salt deposition and mobilization on Nova Scotia- Morocco conjugate margins\nMesozoic rifting at the incipient boundary between the North American and African plates during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic (ca. 180\u2013230\u00a0Ma; Gradstein et al., 2004) generated the conjugate margins of Nova Scotia and Morocco (e.g., Klitgord and Schouten, 1986). Continental rifting on the Scotian-Moroccan conjugate margin was followed by a period of mantle exhumation (Funck et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2018), and subsequently by oceanic spreading that initiated in the Middle to Late Jurassic (e.g., Gradstein et al., 2004) and continues to the present day (Fig. 3\n). Crustal thinning and subsequent thermal subsidence during continental breakup created a number of deep sedimentary basins offshore Nova Scotia (e.g., Abenaki and Sable Basins) and Morocco (e.g., Agadir and Tarfaya Basins) that are filled by significant thicknesses (up to 15\u00a0km) of syn-rift and post-rift sedimentary strata (Wade and MacLean, 1990). Late Triassic syn-rift units of both the Scotian and Moroccan margins are dominated by continental siliciclastics that are overlain by, or transition laterally to, evaporites deposited in continental to shallow marine settings (Lorenz, 1988; Shimeld and Post, 2004). Post-breakup deposition on both margins is characterized by post-rift clastic and carbonate successions that record lateral variations in depositional setting, from shallow marine facies on shelf and slope settings, to deepwater deposition oceanward (Davison, 2005). Seaward migration of Triassic evaporites on the Scotian (Wade and MacLean, 1990; Shimeld and Post, 2004; Adam and Krezsek, 2012; Deptuck and Kendell, 2017) and Moroccan (Tari and Molnar, 2005; Tari et al., 2017) margins records mobilization from Triassic depositional rift basins. Mobilized salt bodies on both margins exhibit a range of geometries, from localized salt diapirs above half-grabens proximal to the respective margins (Fig. 4\n), to large salt sheets and canopies basinwards (Tari and Jabour, 2013; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016; Tari et al., 2017; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2017; Pichel et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.3\nNewfoundland (Grand Banks)-Iberia conjugate margins\nLate Triassic and Early Jurassic rifting on the conjugate Grand Banks-Iberia margin occurred across a wide zone (Jagoutz et al., 2007) and generated the continental rift basins of Grand Banks (South Whale, Whale, Horseshoe, Jeanne d\u2019Arc, Carson-Bonnition, and Salar basins; Fig. 2B) and Iberia (Lusitanian and Porto basins) prior to continental breakup (e.g., P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007; Soares et al., 2012). This rifting was approximately synchronous with rifting between Africa and North America further south (e.g., Deptuck and Kendell, 2017). Similar to the Scotian-Moroccan margins, these basins accumulated continental siliciclastic sediments and evaporite deposits during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic (e.g., Jansa and Wade, 1975; Balkwill and Legall, 1989; Alves et al., 2002; Rowan, 2014). Unlike the Scotian-Moroccan margins that underwent a relatively rapid transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading (e.g., Funck et al., 2004), the Grand Banks-Iberia margin experienced a relatively long-lived period of gradual extension and subsidence followed by rapid extension that initiated in the Middle-Late Jurassic and culminated in seafloor spreading in the Early Cretaceous (Fig. 3; Tankard et al., 1989; Tucholke et al., 2007).\n\n\n2.4\nCretaceous magmatism and seamounts\nThe Grand Banks-Iberia conjugate margins are generally considered the type example of a non-volcanic rifted margin (e.g., Jagoutz et al., 2007), while the Nova Scotia margin is thought to represent a transition from volcanic margins of the US east coast to non-volcanic margins northwards (e.g., Wu et al., 2006). Volcanic seamounts are present in both the Fogo and southern Salar basins (Hall et al., 1977; Sullivan and Keen, 1977; Jagoutz et al., 2007; Pe-Piper et al., 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007). Both volcanic and intrusive rocks representing a wide range of compositions and geochemical affinities have been encountered in exploration wells, deep sea drilling campaigns, and dredge samples across the region (see Pe-Piper et al., 2007 and Jagoutz et al., 2007 for reviews). Buried Cretaceous volcanoes and igneous sills have been identified in seismic data in the Fogo and Salar basins, and magnetic anomalies across the region have been interpreted as indicators of magmatic emplacement (Pe-Piper et al., 2006, 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007; P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2010). Published ages of volcanic and intrusive rocks encountered across the area range from ca. 135 Ma to ca. 98 Ma (e.g., Tucholke and Ludwig, 1982; Jansa et al., 1993; Pe-Piper et al., 2007), indicating complex timing relationships between emplacement of volcanics and intrusives, and continental breakup processes (Jagoutz et al., 2007).\n\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nSeismic data, seismic interpretation, and potential field data\nStudy results are primarily derived from structural and stratigraphic interpretation of five regional depth-migrated 2D seismic reflection profiles across the Grand Banks, Fogo Basin, Newfoundland Ridge, southern Newfoundland transform margin, and southern Salar basin (Fig. 1). These seismic profiles come from a newly available regional 2D seismic data grid acquired across the area by TGS-NOPEC and PGS in partnership with the Oil and Gas Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador from 2014 to 2019 (see Fig. 1 for seismic profiles used in this study). Published lithostratigraphic frameworks (Fig. 3; Sinclair, 1994; Weston et al., 2012), and publicly available well-penetration data (e.g., Narwhal F-99, Brant P-87, Mallard M-45 wells; see Fig. 2 for locations) with associated stratigraphic ages (Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, 2007) were used, where appropriate, to constrain regional seismic horizon interpretations.\nSeven seismic stratigraphic horizons were mapped across the study area (Fig. 3), from Base Mesozoic (top of Paleozoic basement) to seafloor. Seismic stratigraphic horizons were interpreted across 2D profiles where seismic facies and prominent seismic reflectors suggested the presence of unconformities, rotated fault blocks, or depositional packages (e.g., Fig. 5\n). We interpret salt bodies in seismic data where reflectors are absent or incoherent, and associated synthetic dip of adjacent coherent reflectors as indicative of sediment mobility above salt bodies. Some of these interpreted salt structures in the region have been proven by drilling (e.g., Fig. 4).\nRegional magnetic anomaly data (Fig. 2A; Oakey and Dehler, 2004) aided identification of potential intervals and locations in seismic data with high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic anomaly \u2018highs\u2019 (e.g., Fig. 5) are interpreted as positions on seismic profiles that record either (i) magmatic intrusions (e.g., Tucholke et al., 2007), (ii) volcaniclastic intervals (e.g., Davy and Caldwell, 1998), or (iii) mobilized, altered sediments and volcaniclastics associated with evaporite diapirism (Hayward et al., 2014). Regional crustal thickness estimates across the Newfoundland margin (Fig. 2B; Nirrengarten et al., 2018) were used to guide Moho identification by providing approximate depths in seismic data where prominent reflectors or reflector discontinuities in seismic data could tentatively be used as indicators of seismic Moho.\n\n\n3.2\nCross-section construction, structural restoration, and map-based reconstruction\nCross-section construction, kinematic restoration of interpreted faults, decompaction of sedimentary intervals (Sclater and Christie, 1980), and backstripping (i.e., removal) of interpreted layers through progressive restoration of regional cross sections was performed using Move 2019.1\u2122 (Petroleum Experts). Kinematic restoration and crustal area balancing results (progressive changes in cross section length) were used as direct inputs for our map-based reconstructions of the study area, allowing us to estimate crustal thicknesses as progressive rifting occurred on the Newfoundland and Scotian margins. Present-day 2D crustal area in each cross section was measured by using upper (interpreted Top Basement) and lower (inferred Moho) crustal boundaries (see Cawood et al., 2021a, 2021b for detailed descriptions of the approach). Comparison of present-day 2D crustal areas with an assumed pre-rift crustal thickness of 30\u00a0km on the margin (Funck et al., 2004; Welford and Hall, 2007; Dehler and Welford, 2013; Lau et al., 2018) allowed us to (i) carry out crustal area balancing as the final restoration step for each regional cross section, (ii) estimate extents of full-thickness (>30\u00a0km) continental crust across the study area prior to rifting, and (iii) independently assess extension magnitudes across the area, irrespective of seismic data resolution.\nGPlates (M\u00fcller et al., 2018) was used for data compilation and for comparing our kinematic restoration and map reconstruction results with existing plate reconstructions. Tectonic plate positions, displacement vectors, and rotation poles from published plate reconstructions (M\u00fcller et al., 2008, 2019; Seton et al., 2012; Nirrengarten et al., 2018) were used (i) as regional frameworks for our plate reconstruction results, and (ii) as independent benchmarks for results derived from structural restoration of regional seismic interpretations.\n\n\n\n4\nStructural interpretations\n\n4.1\nNW-SE cross sections\nCross sections 1\u2019, 1, 2, and 3 (Figs. 5 and 6\n) are oriented approximately parallel to the dominant extension direction (NW-SE) south of the Grand Banks along regional seismic reflection profiles. These sections provide cross-sectional views of rift-related structures and configurations in the Fogo Basin and across the Newfoundland Ridge. Cross sections 1\u2019, 1, and 2 are situated to the SW of the southern Newfoundland transform margin, whereas cross section 3 is interpreted to cross the relict transform margin obliquely, from the Grand Banks in the NW portion of the section to the northern edge of the Newfoundland Ridge in the SE (Fig. 2B).\n\n4.1.1\nCross section 1\u2019\nCross section 1\u2019 (Fig. 5A) transects 764\u00a0km of NW-SE oriented seismic profile and provides an overview of extensional structures from the South Whale Basin, through the Fogo Basin, and to the SE margin of the Newfoundland Ridge (see Figs. 1 and 2). Based on the approximate position of the southern Newfoundland transform margin (Fig. 2B) and abrupt changes in crustal thicknesses SW from the Grand Banks and NE from the Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 2B; Nirrengarten et al., 2018), we suggest this regional cross section parallels \u2013 above tectonically thinned continental crust \u2013 the juxtaposition of continental and oceanic domains along the southern Newfoundland transform margin. Deformation along cross section 1\u2019 is dominated by crustal-scale extensional faults and rotated basement blocks in the hanging walls of these faults (Fig. 5). These crustal-scale faults generally dip to the SE through most of cross section 1\u2019, and associated with these faults are rotated basement blocks, frequent extensional half-grabens, and occasional grabens.\nDiapirism of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic evaporites, and rotation and deformation of Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous strata associated with salt mobility (e.g., Rowan, 2014) is evident across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge (Figs. 5\u20137\n). Evaporite diapirs throughout cross section 1\u2019 are generally best developed above, or in close proximity to, extensional grabens and half-grabens (Fig. 5). Localized syn-rift sedimentation in grabens and half-grabens is interpreted to be Late Triassic to Early Jurassic in age, and dominated by evaporite deposition (Figs. 3 and 5). Localized diapirism above extensional evaporite sub-basins has been observed on the conjugate margin in Morocco (e.g., Tari and Molnar, 2005), and in numerical models of diapir formation above crustal-scale faults (e.g., Pichel et al., 2019). Little evidence for salt sheets and canopies (see Rowan, 2014) that would indicate significant lateral movement of evaporites is observed in the study area, and salt bodies are interpreted to have formed as a result of primarily vertical salt movement from original depositional positions. The majority of interpreted salt bodies on cross section 1\u2019 have geometries that show vertical salt movement, rather than laterally developed sheets or canopies (Fig. 5A).\n\n\n4.1.2\nCross sections 1, 2, and 3\nCross section 1 shows a more detailed view across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 5B). Structural configurations in this part of the cross section are generally similar to those observed to the NW (Fig. 5A), but with some significant differences. As with further to the NW, crustal-scale extensional faults dominate both large-scale patterns of deformation and associated depositional architectures of Late Triassic to uppermost Cretaceous sedimentary strata. In contrast to positions more proximal to the Scotian margin, however, extensional faults here exhibit variable polarity (Fig. 7D), and the NW edge of the Newfoundland Ridge is marked by a distinct change from almost exclusively SE-dipping faults in the Fogo Basin to both NW- and SE-dipping faults on the Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 5D).\nSeveral areas appear to show evidence for Early Cretaceous magmatic activity. A buried volcano is interpreted in the NW part of cross section 1 (Figs. 7B and 8\n). In contrast to salt diapirs interpreted on the section, which also record local changes in elevation of prominent seismic reflectors, this buried volcanic edifice shows no evidence for deformed sedimentary strata either above it or on its flanks. Bright packages of high amplitude reflectors observed elsewhere on cross section 1 are interpreted to represent volcanic successions (Fig. 6A and B), which may include lava flows, volcaniclastic material, and\/or hydrothermally altered material (see Hayward et al., 2014). These successions are coincident with elevated magnetic anomaly values (up to ca. 800\u00a0nT; Figs. 2A and 5B), and could reflect either primary magnetization of iron minerals, or secondary alteration and magnetization of sediments and volcanic material, as has been recorded elsewhere on the Canadian continental margin (Hayward et al., 2014).\nThe largest evaporite diapirs in the study area generally occur above rotated Paleozoic basement blocks where displacement along crustal-scale extensional faults is greatest (e.g., Fig. 9\n). We attribute this configuration to variable displacement along crustal-scale faults during Late Triassic to Early Jurassic rifting, and the effects of this variable displacement on available accommodation space and evaporite deposition in extensional grabens and half-grabens. This relationship is most clearly recorded in cross section 2 (Figs. 5C and 7), where rotated reflectors within a SE-thickening sedimentary package record evaporite mobilization and evacuation adjacent to and upward from crustal-scale basement faults.\nThe area between the NW edge of the Newfoundland Ridge and the Fogo Basin in cross section 1 (Fig. 5B) is characterized by very low crustal thicknesses, ranging from ca. 2.2\u00a0km based on our seismic interpretations, to ca. 3.2\u00a0km from gravity-derived estimates (Nirrengarten et al., 2018). This hyper-attenuated zone is coincident with the occurrence of several stacked low-angle extensional faults, which we interpret as having (i) accommodated significant amounts of extension during continental rifting, and (ii) enabled brittle thinning of continental crust in this area (Fig. 10\n). This regional change in fault polarity coincident with a zone of hyperextended continental crust (Fig. 7D) is similar to structural configurations found in parts of the Orphan Basin (Cawood et al., 2021b), where extreme crustal thinning is marked by stacked low-angle faults of opposing polarity.\nAbrupt changes in basement topography and the occurrence of a large mobilized salt body above several basement fault blocks (Fig. 11\n) are interpreted to be genetically linked and attributed to: (i) early generation of accommodation space by displacement along crustal-scale faults, (ii) evaporite deposition in extensional grabens and half-grabens during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic time period, (iii) infill and downbuilding of post-salt sedimentary strata and associated salt withdrawal due to loading by higher-density sediment deposition, (iv) SE thickening of the sedimentary succession due to salt evacuation, continued accommodation space generation, and progressive sedimentary infilling, and (v) up-dip evaporite evacuation along extensional faults and salt diapir formation above basement highs.\n\n\n4.1.3\nCrustal thickness variations along NW-SE cross sections\nSeismic interpretations of Moho depth where prominent reflectors or reflector discontinuities in seismic data could tentatively be used as indicators of seismic Moho were guided in part by gravity-derived estimates of crustal thickness (Fig. 2B; Nirrengarten et al., 2018). Tentative Moho interpretations record significant variability in the thickness of continental crust across the three NW-SE cross sections (Figs. 5 and 6). Crustal thicknesses in the Fogo Basin range from a maximum of ca. 18.5\u00a0km proximal to the Scotian margin in the NW, to a minimum of ca. 2\u00a0km on the NW margin of the Newfoundland Ridge to the SE (Fig. 5B).\nCrustal thicknesses of up to 27\u00a0km beneath the SE edge of the Grand Banks (cross section 3; Fig. 5D) indicate that continental crust beneath this area is relatively unstretched. Thinned crust to the SE from the Grand Banks along cross section 3 (Fig. 5D) records (i) NW-SE extension of the Grand Banks northwest of the southern Newfoundland transform margin, and (ii) reduced crustal thicknesses along the southern Newfoundland transform margin. To the SE of the southern Newfoundland transform margin in an area where strike-slip faulting associated with the transform margin is interpreted, crustal thicknesses increase beneath the Newfoundland Ridge and indicate that this area has experienced less crustal attenuation by normal faulting and ductile processes.\n\n\n\n4.2\nCross sections 4 and 5\nCross section 4 (Fig. 12\nA) transects the SE edge of the Grand Banks and part of the southern Salar Basin. Crustal structure in cross section 4 is distinct from the area SW of the southern Newfoundland transform margin in that (i) continental crust exhibits a relatively abrupt thickness change from 26\u00a0km on the SE edge of the Grand Banks to zero at the continental-oceanic transition over a horizontal distance of 156\u00a0km (Fig. 12A), (ii) exhumed and faulted subcontinental mantle is interpreted oceanward of stretched continental crust based on lateral changes in seismic character, a change in crustal-scale fault polarity along the profile (Figs. 12A and 13A), and (\niii) oceanic crust is interpreted to be present on the ESE end of the seismic profile based on existing maps of oceanic crust in the area (Tucholke et al., 2007). Further, we find no evidence for either in-situ or diapiric salt bodies, and syn-rift strata contained between rotated basement blocks are interpreted to be no older than Late Jurassic, based on mapped seismic horizons (Fig. 12A).\nApparent thinning of Jurassic strata to the SE and the absence of salt diapirs on cross section 4 suggest that rifting NE of the Newfoundland Ridge primary occurred during the Cretaceous. This is consistent with published ages of rifting (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2010), mantle exhumation (Tucholke et al., 2007), and the onset of seafloor spreading (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007) between the conjugate margins of Newfoundland (Grand Banks) and Iberia. Based on apparent age relationships from our seismic interpretations and published ages of rifting and breakup between Newfoundland (Grand Banks) and Iberia, cross section 4 represents a structural domain, in terms of both structural style and rifting age, that is distinct from the Fogo Basin and southern Newfoundland transform margin (cross sections 1, 2, and 3). The absence of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic evaporite units and Middle Jurassic sedimentary strata in cross section 4, and the widespread occurrence of these intervals in cross sections 1, 2, and 3 provide evidence for the age discontinuity represented by the southern Newfoundland transform margin, between the Scotian margin and Fogo Basin (Triassic to Jurassic rifting) to the SW, and the Grand Banks and southern Salar Basin (Late Jurassic and Cretaceous rifting) to the NE.\nCross section 5 (Fig. 12B), oriented perpendicular to cross sections 1, 2, and 3, transects the Newfoundland Ridge and the southern Newfoundland transform margin (Figs. 2 and 3). Because this cross section transects both the Scotian and Newfoundland extensional margins across a transform fault system (e.g., Auzende et al., 1970; Grant, 1977; Todd et al., 1988), there has likely been a large amount of strike-slip movement of sedimentary strata across the plane of the section (e.g., Richard et al., 1995). Consequently, structural configurations, stratigraphic patterns, and age relationships are variable along its length. Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic evaporites and sedimentary strata are present across the SW part of cross section 5 (Fig. 13), but absent to the NE where the seismic profile crosses into the southern Salar Basin (Fig. 14\n). This NE segment of the cross section is also marked by a more chaotic zone of seismic reflectors and an apparent absence of continental crust where exhumed subcontinental mantle may represent the top basement surface (Fig. 13).\nIn contrast to cross sections 1-4, relatively few crustal-scale extensional faults are observable in seismic data along cross section 5 (Fig. 12B). The orientation of this cross section is approximately perpendicular to dominant extension directions on both the Scotian and Newfoundland extensional margins and therefore crustal-scale normal faults are generally not observed on the Newfoundland Ridge in cross section 5. Apparent offset of the top basement horizon along steeply dipping faults on the Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 12B) is not interpreted as simple extensional offset along normal faults, but rather as (i) the juxtaposition of basement blocks along strike-slip faults and transfer zones, with apparent offset caused by variable pre-faulting basement topography, and (ii) transtensional and transpressional structures between curved, en-echelon, and variably oriented strike-slip faults and transfer zones.\n\n\n\n5\nStructural restorations\nStructural restorations of the three NW-SE oriented cross sections yield broadly similar results. Relatively little or no extensional fault heave is restored between present-day and the 114\u00a0Ma restoration time step in cross sections 1, 2, and 3 (Figs. 15\u201317\n\n\n). Backstripping and decompaction of intervals above the K_114 horizon (see Fig. 3 for summary lithostratigraphy and seismic horizons) provides an approximation of paleobathymetry at the 114\u00a0Ma restoration step. Early Cretaceous volcanic features observed in seismic data in cross sections 1 and 2 (Figs. 6 and 7) would likely have been positive topographic features at the seafloor at this time, and would partly define bathymetry in the area (Figs. 15 and 16). The 145\u00a0Ma restoration steps for cross sections 1, 2, and 3 show crustal-scale extension was ongoing between 145 and 114\u00a0Ma, and cross sections 1, 2, and 3 were extended by 3\u00a0km, 4\u00a0km, and 14\u00a0km respectively during this time period (Table 1\n).\nThe time interval between 163 and 145\u00a0Ma represents both greater magnitude of total extension for the three NW-SE cross sections, and higher extension rate compared to subsequent time steps (Table 1). Total measured extension and calculated extension rates are highest for the three cross sections between 210 and 180\u00a0Ma, and subsequent restored time intervals record progressive decreases in both total extension amounts and rates. This consistent trend for the three NW-SE cross sections suggests that continental rifting across the South Whale Basin, Fogo Basin, and SW margin of the Grand Banks was relatively rapid during early rift stages (Late Triassic and Early Jurassic), and that extension rates decreased as rifting continued into the Cretaceous.\nThese results are consistent with (i) decreasing extension rates observed in other continental rift basins on the Newfoundland margin (Cawood et al., 2021b), and (ii) Middle Jurassic mantle exhumation and seafloor spreading to the SW of the southern Newfoundland transform margin (M\u00fcller et al., 2019), which likely led to a relaxation of extensional strain within continental domains as North America and Africa continued to separate. Note that partial restoration steps in Figs. 16 and 17 depict changes in salt body geometries prior to the restoration of fault heave associated with those time steps. These intermediate steps allowed us to approximately capture changes to salt body geometries as graben or half-graben evaporite fill was progressively evacuated and mobilized as Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentation and downbuilding continued.\nTotal measured extension magnitudes for cross sections 1, 2, and 3 provide evidence for a spatial gradient in rift-related extension, from higher values in the SW (96.4\u00a0km total measured extension for cross section 1) to lower values in the NE (68.9\u00a0km total measured extension for cross section 3). We attribute this to (i) greater amounts of extension to the SW due to rift-related extension between Nova Scotia and Morocco during the Triassic and Jurassic, and (ii) the increasing influence of transfer faults in accommodating lateral displacement proximal to the southern Newfoundland transform margin. Furthermore, extension rates for 210-163\u00a0Ma are lower for cross section 3 than for cross sections 1 and 2. We attribute this to older and younger rifting to the SW and NE of southern Newfoundland transform margin, along the Scotian and Newfoundland margins respectively (see M\u00fcller et al., 2019 for global plate reconstructions). This is manifest as generally higher rates of early (Late Triassic) extension and lower rates of later Jurassic extension along cross section 1, whereas cross sections 2 and 3 show relatively low values of extension for the Triassic, and higher extension magnitudes for Jurassic restoration steps.\nStructural restoration steps for cross section 4 (Fig. 18\n), provide an overview of rift evolution and continental breakup on the Newfoundland margin. In contrast to cross sections 1, 2, and 3, the oldest restored time step for cross section 4 is 175\u00a0Ma, which we interpret as the approximate age of earliest rifting in this position, based on interpretation of seismic markers and ages inferred from the literature (e.g., P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007; M\u00fcller et al., 2008, 2019; Nirrengarten et al., 2018; Seton et al., 2012). Continental rifting, thinning, and extension of continental crust are represented in cross section 4 by the 175-135\u00a0Ma time interval. This is followed by (i) exhumation of subcontinental mantle on the Newfoundland margin between 135 and 125\u00a0Ma, and (ii) extensional faulting of exhumed subcontinental mantle (see Tucholke et al., 2007 for discussions of exhumation and subsequent extensional faulting of subcontinental mantle on the Newfoundland margin). The period between 114\u00a0Ma and 65\u00a0Ma is represented in cross section 4 as the time step in which seafloor spreading and emplacement of oceanic crust occurs. This is consistent with both our seismic interpretations, and published estimates of seafloor spreading initiating at approximately 112\u00a0Ma on the Newfoundland margin (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007).\nThe NE-SW orientation of cross section 5, approximately perpendicular to the regional extension direction, prohibits us from carrying out a full kinematic or crustal area balancing restoration of this cross section. As noted in Section 4.2, the majority of faults shown in cross section 5 are interpreted to represent strike-slip motion in and out of the cross-section plane, and therefore restoring seismic markers along these faults would result in bulk changes to cross section length that are not appropriate in this case. In spite of these limitations, we were able to depict emplacement and subsequent extension of exhumed subcontinental mantle between 135 and 114\u00a0Ma by extending the length of the restored cross section at time steps 125\u00a0Ma and 114\u00a0Ma (Fig. 19\n), which is consistent with restoration steps for cross section 4 (Fig. 18). By flattening the J_145 horizon to a horizontal datum after decompaction and removal of younger stratigraphic units, we are able to reconstruct stratigraphic thicknesses along cross section 5 at 145\u00a0Ma (Fig. 19).\nAbrupt changes in stratigraphic thicknesses at the 145\u00a0Ma time step represent potential indicators of lateral displacement along strike-slip faults or transfer zones that we were not able to assess through seismic interpretation alone. The relationship between abrupt sedimentary thickness changes and the amount of offset along strike-slip faults is not easily decipherable in cross section 5. Analog modeling of transtensional systems (Rahe et al., 1998; Sims et al., 1999) has shown that abrupt changes in sedimentary thicknesses may be related to transtensional deformation but that the magnitude of thickness change across a transfer fault does not directly correspond with magnitude of strike-slip fault displacement. A potential contractional structure is also observed on cross section 5 (see cross section 2 intersection, Fig. 12B). Such contractional structures commonly form in strike-slip systems due to local transpression at restraining bends on faults, contractional stepovers between en-echelon fault segments, or contraction at fault tips. These structural styles have been observed in analog models (e.g., Richard et al., 1995; Casas et al., 2001), and in field-based studies (e.g., Sylvester, 1988; Dooley and McClay, 1996). As an alternative to kinematic and crustal area restoration of cross section 5, we use the intersection of cross section 5 on cross sections 1-3 as inputs for estimating the approximate positions of segments along cross section 5 in map reconstructions.\nStructural restorations for cross sections 1\u2019 and 1\u20134 include crustal area balancing, whereby continental crust in cross sections is restored to an assumed pre-deformation thickness of 30\u00a0km. Estimates of pre-deformation crustal thickness vary across the South Whale Basin and Newfoundland margin (e.g., Funck et al., 2004; Welford and Hall, 2007; Dehler and Welford, 2013; Welford et al., 2020) according to a range of factors, including terrane boundary positions and pre-extension orogenic structural grains. We assume a constant pre-deformation thickness of 30\u00a0km across the study area, but acknowledge that pre-rift crustal thicknesses in the region were likely variable because of differences in crustal composition and complex juxtapositions of Paleozoic Meguma and Avalon terranes, and pre-rift Appalachian orogenesis that likely resulted in variable thickening of continental crust on the Newfoundland margin. Crustal area balancing is not carried out for cross section 5 because we attribute crustal thinning on this line to NW-SE directed extension and therefore changing lengths of a NE-SW oriented cross section according to crustal thicknesses is not appropriate.\n\n\n6\nMap-based reconstructions\nStructural and stratigraphic interpretations (Figs. 5\u201314) and structural (kinematic and crustal area balanced) restorations of interpreted seismic profiles (Figs. 15\u201319) provide direct inputs for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the Grand Banks, Fogo Basin, Newfoundland Ridge, southern Newfoundland transform margin, and southern Salar Basin using GPlates (Fig. 20\n). Published crustal thickness data (Nirrengarten et al., 2018) and plate reconstructions (M\u00fcller et al., 2008, 2019; Seton et al., 2012; Nirrengarten et al., 2018) were used to estimate pre-rift thickness of continental crust. Tectonostratigraphic frameworks (Tucholke et al., 2007; Adam and Krezsek, 2012; Tari and Jabour, 2013) were used to estimate seismic horizon ages in this frontier area with few exploration wells. Crustal domain boundaries and ages (Sullivan and Keen, 1977; Tucholke and Ludwig, 1982; Maillard et al., 2006; Pe-Piper et al., 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007; Dehler and Welford, 2013; Lau et al., 2018; Nirrengarten et al., 2018; Kusznir et al., 2020) constrained allowable cross section lengths at specific time steps and permitted us to estimate areal extents of full thickness continental crust along the southern Newfoundland transform margin.\nAccording to global plate reconstructions (e.g., Le Pichon and Fox, 1971; M\u00fcller et al., 2008, 2019) Africa, North America, and Iberia were part of a single continental landmass prior to 210\u00a0Ma, and rifting associated with the eventual opening of the North Atlantic had not yet initiated. 210 Ma (Fig. 20A) is therefore used as the approximate time step for pre-rift configurations across the study area. Crustal area balancing of regional profiles (cross sections 1-3 are excerpts from regional profiles) with crustal thickness data (Nirrengarten et al., 2018) results in pre-deformation cross section lengths that fall entirely within the reconstructed full-thickness North American continent (see dark blue line in Fig. 20A which defines the estimated edge of full thickness pre-rift continental crust). Cross section 5 is split into segments (solid green lines) at this pre-extension stage and placed along cross sections 1-3 according to the position of present-day cross section intersections (dashed white and green lines) and the estimated amount of extension along each of the NW-SE cross sections.\nThe 180\u00a0Ma reconstruction step (Fig. 20B) shows significant rift-related continental extension between Africa and North America, and mantle exhumation and\/or seafloor spreading is interpreted to have initiated at approximately this time (M\u00fcller et al., 2019). Extension between North America and Iberia between 210 and 180\u00a0Ma is represented at the 180\u00a0Ma reconstruction step by relatively little separation between these continents (e.g., Nirrengarten et al., 2018), and distributed extension across the Grand Banks. This distributed extension has been interpreted as having led to the formation of Triassic rift basins across the Grand Banks (e.g., Jeanne d\u2019Arc, Carson, and Whale basins) and Iberian (Lusitanian and Porto basins) margins (e.g., Tucholke et al., 2007). Note that distributed Late Triassic extension across the Grand Banks is not represented in the map reconstructions in Fig. 20. Triassic rift basins also formed on the Moroccan and Scotian margins at 180\u00a0Ma (Shimeld and Post, 2004; Tari and Jabour, 2013), but greater separation between Nova Scotia and Africa compared to between Newfoundland and Iberia would have led to a significant discontinuity in extension velocity across the southern Newfoundland transform margin.\nDifferences in interpreted extension rates between the respective conjugate margins of Nova Scotia-Morocco and Newfoundland-Iberia continued until approximately 145\u00a0Ma (Fig. 20C and D), when the rifting rate between Newfoundland and Iberia is thought to have increased (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007; Tucholke et al., 2007; M\u00fcller et al., 2008, 2019; Seton et al., 2012). We interpret the mismatch in extension rates between these conjugate margins as having led to substantial left-lateral displacement across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge from approximately 210 to 145\u00a0Ma (Fig. 20A\u2013D). Restored lengths of NW-SE cross sections (heavy black lines), and approximate positions of cross section 5 segments (solid green lines) provide evidence for a SW-NE velocity gradient across this left-lateral transfer zone (Fig. 20A\u2013D). The SW segments of cross section 5 are interpreted to have been displaced further than those to the NE which we interpret as evidence for this velocity gradient. Variable rates of left-lateral displacement were likely accommodated by a multitude of strike-slip faults that were coevally active across this transfer zone from 210\u00a0Ma to 145\u00a0Ma (Fig. 19). Given that distributed strike-slip is difficult to identify in seismic profiles, we do not explicitly attribute strike-slip magnitudes to individual structures in cross section 5, but rather take a bulk approach to reconstructing lateral displacements.\nExhumation of subcontinental mantle between Newfoundland and Iberia, and associated separation of these landmasses is thought to have occurred between 135 and 125\u00a0Ma (Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007). This led to the addition of new crustal material to cross sections 4 and 5, which both transect part of the exhumed subcontinental mantle domain (Fig. 20E). Volcanic seamounts were emplaced in the Fogo Basin at approximately 135\u00a0Ma (Pe-Piper et al., 2007), between 10 and 30 million years after the main phase of left-lateral transfer across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 20E). The onset of seafloor spreading and emplacement of oceanic crust between Newfoundland and Iberia at 112\u00a0Ma (P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic et al., 2007) added a small amount of crustal material to cross section 4 (Fig. 12A) between 125\u00a0Ma (Figs. 20E) and 65\u00a0Ma (Fig. 20F). Sedimentation through the Cretaceous continued to drive limited salt diapirism across the area, and led to localized growth of salt diapirs until approximately the end of the Cretaceous (see Fig. 11). This continued growth of salt diapirs through the Cretaceous, followed by phases of ocean-current-driven scouring and removal of sediments at the Newfoundland Ridge during the Cenozoic (Boyle et al., 2017), led to present-day bathymetric expressions of salt diapirs across this area (Figs. 1 and 16G).\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nAnatomy of the southern Newfoundland transform margin\nOur seismic interpretation, structural restoration, and map reconstruction results show that the southern Newfoundland transform margin is represented by a wide (100\u2013150\u00a0km) left-lateral transfer zone within extended and attenuated continental crust. Structural interpretations across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge provide evidence for (i) widespread NW-SE directed extension across the region (cross sections 1-3; Figs. 5\u20137), (ii) distributed left-lateral displacement across a wide transfer zone (cross section 5; Figs. 12B and 13B), and (iii) a gradient in total measured extension across parallel cross sections with a decrease in extension from SW to NE (Figs. 15\u201317; Table 1). These results and derived map reconstructions (Fig. 20) provide evidence that the southern Newfoundland transform margin accommodated approximately 500\u00a0km of distributed left-lateral displacement across a 100-150-km-wide zone (see Fig. 12B for width of lateral displacement zone) between the Scotian and Newfoundland margins over a period of approximately 65 million years, from 210\u00a0Ma to 145\u00a0Ma.\nOur observations of extended and thinned continental crust (from inferred full-thickness of 30\u00a0km), and distributed left-lateral displacement across the entire Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge suggest that this relict continental transform is wider than previously recognized. Todd et al. (1988) and Keen et al. (1990) proposed that the southern Newfoundland transform margin is contained within a zone 25\u201340\u00a0km in width, and that the transition from relatively undeformed continental crust of the Grand Banks to the oceanic domain of the Fogo Basin is abrupt. We suggest that both of these studies misclassified extended continental crust as oceanic crust. Seismic velocities of 4.7\u20136.5\u00a0km\/s in \u2018oceanic crust\u2019 (Todd et al., 1988) are more likely to represent extended continental crust and transitional domains (Funck et al., 2003, 2004; Lau et al., 2006, 2018), rather than true oceanic crust, which has seismic velocities of 6.7\u20137.2\u00a0km\/s (White et al., 1992).\nThe results of Todd et al. (1988) and Keen et al. (1990) pre-date a large body of work over the past two decades that documents hyperextension of continental crust, exhumation of subcontinental mantle, and the presence of wide transitional zones on extended margins (e.g., Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Funck et al., 2003, 2004; Jagoutz et al., 2007; Sibuet et al., 2007; Tucholke and Sibuet, 2007; Sibuet and Tucholke, 2013; Lau et al., 2018). Extended margins are now understood to contain complex assemblages of crustal domains across wide zones. The results from this study and therefore continental transform margins are likely be represented by hyperextended continental crust, distributed transfer zones, and complex transitions between crustal domains. The exact nature and architecture of crustal boundaries and juxtapositions will likely vary according to the structural evolution and setting of individual transform margins. It is probable that at many continental transform margins, however, the three crustal types associated with rifting and extension (thinned continental crust, exhumed subcontinental mantle, oceanic crust) will be found.\n\n\n7.2\nOceanic vs. extended continental crust beneath the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge\nKey to our interpretation of extended continental crust beneath the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge are the distribution and geometry of evaporite bodies in seismic profiles. We interpret the presence of syn-rift Triassic evaporites across the study area (Figs. 5\u20138), and show that the distribution of evaporites is directly controlled by accommodation space generated in extensional grabens and half-grabens (e.g., Figs. 6 and 7). Salt diapirs identified across much of the study area are interpreted as having formed as a result of primarily vertical salt movement from original depositional positions (Fig. 11). Salt bodies interpreted on the Newfoundland Ridge resemble those previously documented on the Scotian and Moroccan margins, where widespread salt diapirism and salt-related deformation occurred above extended continental crust (Shimeld and Post, 2004; Tari and Molnar, 2005; Albertz et al., 2010; Adam and Krezsek, 2012).\nMobile salt bodies have been interpreted above exhumed mantle or oceanic crust on the Newfoundland-Iberia (e.g., P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2010; Rowan, 2014), Angolan (Unternehr et al., 2010), and Brazilian (Zal\u00e1n et al., 2011) margins where evaporites appear to have been mobilized laterally over a few tens of kms. We find no evidence in our study area for large salt sheets or canopies that would indicate significant lateral salt movement (see Rowan, 2017 for a review), or lateral translation of salt bodies from original depositional positions with respect to the underlying basement rocks. These observations suggest that the crust beneath the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge must be continental in origin, rather than oceanic. Evaporites of the Scotian margin were deposited in continental to marginal marine environments (e.g., Austin et al., 1989). Therefore, if the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge are underlain by oceanic crust, observed salt bodies in this area would have had to be translated across as much as 500\u00a0km of oceanic crust from their original depositional positions. We suggest that these are unfeasibly large distances for evaporite bodies to have been translated across newly formed oceanic crust.\n\nGradstein et al. (1977) and Grant (1979) were the first to speculate, based on seismic reflection data, that the Newfoundland Ridge is underlain by continental crust. They recognized deep sub-horizontal seismic reflectors in the area and suggested that these could represent sedimentary strata above faulted continental crust. Other early studies, based on interpretation of seismic reflection data (Auzende et al., 1970) and seismic refraction experiments (\u2018oceanic\u2019 crust velocities of 4.9\u20135.9\u00a0km\/s; Sullivan and Keen, 1978) concluded that crust beneath the Newfoundland Ridge is oceanic, and most subsequent work has depicted this area as such. Recent estimates from gravity inversion show that crustal thicknesses beneath the Newfoundland Ridge reach approximately 19\u00a0km (Fig. 2B; Nirrengarten et al., 2018). Assuming that these values are reliable, and if the Newfoundland Ridge is underlain by oceanic crust, then crustal thicknesses here are approximately three times higher than is generally reported for normal thickness oceanic crust (ca. 7\u00a0km; White et al., 1992; Funck et al., 2004).\nMantle-plume-related magmatism has been invoked as a potential cause for above-average thicknesses of oceanic crust beneath the Newfoundland Ridge (Tucholke et al., 2007). The exact mechanisms required to emplace sufficient magma volumes and thicken oceanic crust in the area by almost three times, however, remain unidentified (see Bronner et al., 2011). Furthermore, seismic refraction experiments on the Nova Scotia margin (Funck et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2018) have shown that oceanic crust proximal to the Newfoundland transform margin is thinner (ca. 3\u20134\u00a0km) than is typical (ca. 7\u00a0km) for oceanic settings. Anomalously low thicknesses of oceanic crust have been observed at other Atlantic transform margins, including at the V\u00f8ring Transform Margin (Berndt et al., 2001) and offshore Ghana, where reduced thicknesses of oceanic crust persist for up to 70\u00a0km from the transform margin (Edwards et al., 1997). Juxtaposition of upwelling oceanic mantle against older, colder oceanic crust or cold continental crust is generally thought to reduce upwelling mantle temperature and limit the availability of melt for oceanic crust formation at transform margins (e.g., Fox and Gallo, 1984). Based on these observations, we suggest that an interpretation of 19-km-thick oceanic crust beneath the Newfoundland Ridge, from an as-yet-unidentified source is inconsistent with existing understanding of melt supply at transform margins, and with recent observations from the Scotian margin (Funck et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2018).\n\n\n7.3\nEmplacement and distribution of the Fogo Seamounts\nOur results suggest that the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge are underlain by extended continental crust, and although we reject the hypothesis that this area is underlain by oceanic crust, we acknowledge the presence of igneous rocks across the area. Buried volcanoes are observed in regional seismic profiles (Figs. 5\u20137) and volcanic seamounts of the Fogo Basin have previously been identified in seismic reflection, magnetic anomaly, and seafloor bathymetry data (Pe-Piper et al., 2006, 2007). As noted by Pe-Piper et al. (2007), the volcanic seamounts of the Fogo Basin are genetically unrelated to either the formation of oceanic crust between the Nova Scotian and Moroccan, or the passage of a mantle plume or hotspot. Our observations of Cretaceous volcanoes within post-rift Cretaceous strata (Fig. 6B) and plate reconstruction results (Fig. 20) suggest that the vast majority of left-lateral displacement along the southern Newfoundland transform margin took place at least 15 million years prior to emplacement of the Fogo seamounts (dated at ca. 135 Ma; Pe-Piper et al., 2007).\nBased on these results, we suggest that there is not a direct link between continental rifting along the Scotian margin and the emplacement of the Fogo seamounts. Pe-Piper et al. (2007) suggest that rifting between Newfoundland and Iberia led to the upwelling of melt along the \u2018\u2018leaky\u2019\u2019 southern Newfoundland transform margin after the main phase of left-lateral transfer had ceased. Analogous seamounts along \u201cleaky\u201d transform margins have been interpreted at continental transform margins offshore California (Davis et al., 2002), offshore Ghana (Edwards et al., 1997), and in the SW Barents Sea (Eldholm et al., 1987), and we therefore do not dispute the general model of Pe-Piper et al. (2007). Further, a global synthesis by Ziegler and Cloetingh (2004) showed that systematic timing relationships between magmatic emplacement and rifting phases do not always exist. Finally, while we generally agree with the conclusions of Pe-Piper et al. (2007), we suggest, based on our interpretations of modern seismic data, that some of the bathymetric highs that they interpret as volcanic seamounts (Figs. 1 and 4 in Pe-Piper et al., 2007) are in fact evaporite diapirs (e.g., Fig. 7B). Bathymetric features on the Newfoundland Ridge identified in this study as evaporite diapirs are shown as red dashed polygons in Fig. 16G.\n\n\n7.4\nCrustal structure and tectonic evolution of the southern Newfoundland transform margin\nAs shown in our map-based reconstruction (Fig. 20), discrepancies in rifting ages between the conjugate margins of Nova Scotia\u2013Morocco and Newfoundland\u2013Iberia led to formation of a wide (100\u2013150\u00a0km) left-lateral transfer zone along the SW edge of the Grand Banks that was primarily active between 210 and 145\u00a0Ma. The southern Newfoundland transform margin was initially formed due to progressive separation of North America and Africa that was not matched by similar amounts of extension between the landmasses of North America and Iberia in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic (Fig. 21\nA and B). The transfer zone continued to grow in length along its NW-SE axis, and the locus of lateral displacement progressively migrated to the SE as extension between the Scotian and Moroccan margins continued, but was unmatched by Newfoundland-Iberia separation through the Jurassic (Fig. 21C).\nOur observations of salt diapirs above continental crust in much of the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge suggest that evaporites deposited in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic rift basins would have been passively transported and extended as rifting and left-lateral displacement continued through the Jurassic. This would have had the effect of thinning both continental crust and overlying evaporite strata across the SW margin of the Grand Banks, leading to the formation of an elongate zone of stretched and thinned evaporites that were initially deposited in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic rift basins, and were later extended as those rift basins were further deformed (Fig. 20A\u2013E). As extension and left-lateral displacement continued across the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge through the Jurassic, rift-related accommodation space would have been generated above extended continental crust. Deposition of Jurassic sediments into extended and extending salt basins would eventually have driven salt diapirism, in spite of evaporite strata having been thinned in the early stages of rifting, and led to the formation of salt diapirs (Fig. 20E\u2013G), which are observed in seismic profiles (Figs. 5\u20138).\nAt around 145\u00a0Ma, separation between Newfoundland and Iberia initiated by continental rifting, subsequently by exhumation of subcontinental mantle (135-120\u00a0Ma), and finally by the formation of an oceanic spreading center (112\u00a0Ma). The transform margin ceased activity at approximately 145\u2013135\u00a0Ma, and as seafloor spreading eventually initiated between Newfoundland and Iberia at ca. 112 Ma (Tucholke et al., 2007), the extended margins of Nova Scotia, Morocco, Newfoundland, and Iberia would have transitioned to tectonic quiescence (Fig. 21D). From 112\u00a0Ma, relative extension rates between Nova Scotia\u2013Morocco and Newfoundland\u2013Iberia were likely comparable (e.g., M\u00fcller et al., 2019) and extension rate gradients across the southern Newfoundland transform margin were probably minimal (Fig. 20E\u2013G). The eventual merging of oceanic domains at the eastern margin of the Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 21E) at approximately 110\u2013105\u00a0Ma would have led to present-day configurations, where a fragment of deformed continental crust (i.e., the Newfoundland Ridge) is surrounded on three sides by oceanic lithosphere at the edge of a relict continental transform margin.\nOur interpreted tectonic evolution for the Newfoundland Ridge, Fogo Basin, and southern Newfoundland transform margin provides a kinematic solution to lithospheric deformation in the area. These results are compatible with variable estimated crustal thicknesses (ca. 3\u201332\u00a0km) and published estimates of extension ages on the Scotian and Newfoundland margins (see Fig. 3). Our observations of highly extended continental crust and a wide zone of distributed displacement transfer across the southern Newfoundland transform margin document the role of crustal deformation in accommodating regional extension. These results emphasize the need for moving away from plate models that treat continental crust as rigid and undeformable, and towards deformable plate models (e.g., M\u00fcller et al., 2019; Peace et al., 2019; Ady and Whittaker, 2019; Peace, 2021) that allow for lithospheric deformation at the plate scale.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nStructural interpretation of newly available seismic reflection data, kinematic restoration of structural interpretations, and crustal area balancing of regional cross sections allowed us to characterize present-day crustal structure of the Newfoundland Ridge, Fogo Basin, and southern Newfoundland transform margin. These results provide the basis for map-based reconstructions that constrain the tectonic evolution and structural development of the area. The key findings of this study are:\n\n1.\nThe Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge are underlain by extended continental crust. This finding is based on the recognition of syn-rift Triassic evaporites throughout the study area, with little evidence for lateral movement of salt bodies. We document evidence for salt diapirism and show that evaporite bodies formed as a result of primarily vertical salt movement from original depositional positions in grabens and half-grabens in extended continental crust. Published ages of oceanic crust and a lack of evidence for significant lateral salt movement in the area suggest that crust beneath salt bodies in the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge must be continental in origin.\n\n\n2.\nWe interpret the southern Newfoundland transform margin as a 100\u2013150\u00a0km wide zone of distributed left-lateral displacement that bounded the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge to the NE, and was active during the Late Triassic and Jurassic. Differences in extension rates between the conjugate margins of Nova Scotia\u2013Morocco and Newfoundland\u2013Iberia during the Late Triassic and Jurassic led to an extensional gradient between these margins and the formation of this continental transform margin.\n\n\n3.\nOur reconstruction results are consistent with present-day crustal thicknesses, established age relationships across the area, and global plate reconstructions. We provide a compelling alternative to generally accepted depictions of (i) oceanic crust beneath the Fogo Basin and Newfoundland Ridge, and (ii) the southern Newfoundland transform margin as an abrupt discontinuity between continental and oceanic domains.\n\n\n\n\n","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"","64":"","65":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Sin\u00fa Fold Belt (SFB), located mostly offshore northwest Colombia, together with the San Jacinto Fold Belt, located onshore northwest Colombia, are the leading and trailing parts respectively of a NE-SW trending accretionary wedge developed to the south of the Colombian Basin (Fig. 1\na and b). This NW-directed accretionary wedge resulted from eastwards, low-angle subduction of oceanic rocks and sediments belonging to the Caribbean Plate under arc terranes along the northwest edge of the South American continent that belong to the South American Plate (e.g., Ladd and Truchan, 1983; Ladd et al., 1984) (Fig. 1c). In this paper we will focus on the offshore part of the SFB between the Uramita Fault to the south and the Magdalena Fan to the north. This part of the belt is exceptionally well imaged in high quality seismic data.\nMost of the knowledge on the large-scale structure of the SFB come from geological interpretation of seismic reflection profiles, which has allowed the construction of geological sections (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) as well as structural maps (e.g., Vitali et al., 1985; Cediel and C\u00e1ceres, 2000; Flinch et al., 2003b; Cediel, 2011; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) of the belt, and their integration into lithosphere-scale transects from the Colombian Basin, across the Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto belt, to the San Jorge Basin (included in the Lower Magdalena Basin), to the mountain range (Central and Eastern Cordillera) (e.g., Flinch et al., 2003a; Mantilla-Pimiento, 2007; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015; Flinch and Castillo, 2015; Mora-Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2017) (Fig. 1c), or even to the foreland basin developed eastwards of the mountain range (e.g., Vargas and Mann, 2013). Thus, the SFB has been the subject of many studies, not only because of its scientific interest, but because of its hydrocarbon potential explored from the sixties to present day by many oil companies. However, in our opinion some interesting large-scale issues still need to be fully understood. Some refer to the belt kinematics, i.e., belt shortening, basal detachment displacement and vertical subsidence\/uplift, whereas others refer to its geometry, i.e., taper angle, morphology, relief and thickness. Likewise, the interrelationships between its geometry and kinematics, and how these elements influence each other spatially and through time, must be established.\nRegarding horizontal movements of the SFB, some studies have quantified the shortening responsible for the SFB (e.g., Ruiz et al., 2000; Kellogg et al., 2005; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) and the magnitude of tectonic plate motion (e.g., Freymueller et al., 1993; Kellogg and Vega, 1995; Trenkamp et al., 2002), however, neither the amount of displacement along the accretionary-prism basal detachment nor its relationship with the belt shortening and plate motion have been analyzed. As regards vertical movements of the SFB, we are aware of only one study on the subsidence\/uplift in a Colombian Basin section adjacent to the SFB (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019), but there have been no studies of the SFB up to date. With respect to the taper angle, two analyses have been carried out (Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015), but the new data available allow for more detailed measurements of the taper angle, as well as for quantification of its across- and along-strike variations and the parameters that control it. Regarding the SFB relief, recent sedimentation\/erosion processes have been documented in detail (Vinnels et al., 2010), however, this information has not been correlated yet with the activity and kinematics of the underlying structures. Transversal and longitudinal variations in elements such as the SFB morphology, taper angle and crustal thickness have been documented (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Vinnels et al., 2010; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015), however, the relationship between these variations and the belt kinematics has not been examined, and no zoning of the belt has been established yet.\nTo address these issues, we have carried out a geological interpretation of six regional, depth-converted 2D seismic profiles, with the help of a few well-logs and a high-density grid of 2D time seismic profiles. The data obtained have been employed to characterize and quantify large-scale aspects of the SFB, such as horizontal\/vertical motion, taper and morphology, and their variations, together with variations in the structural style, have allowed us to define different morphostructural regions both across and along strike.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe South Caribbean Deformed Belt, developed along the Colombian and Venezuelan coasts, is an accretionary wedge that runs along the convergent margin between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates (Fig. 1a). The Caribbean-Plate relative motion towards ESE since Late Miocene (e.g., Minster and Jordan, 1978; Trenkamp et al., 2002; Pindell and Kennan, 2007) caused different tectonic regimes depending on the shape of the South American Plate boundary. Motion almost parallel to the coastline gave rise to a strike-slip regime in north Colombia and Venezuela, however, motion mainly perpendicular to the coastline produced a compressional setting in the northwestern Colombian coast. The South Caribbean Deformed Belt in northwest Colombia consists of a NE-SW trending double belt called Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto Fold Belt (Fig. 1b), which resulted from a two-stage development (e.g., Galindo and Lonegan, 2013). Thus, the San Jacinto Fold Belt is the innermost portion of the accretionary belt formed by dextral-transpressional collision\/accretion between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates from Paleocene to Oligocene (e.g., Flinch, 2003a, 2003b), whereas the SFB is the outermost part of the accretionary belt and reflects a Late Miocene to Recent compressive stage related to the Andean orogeny (e.g., Duque-Caro, 1979; Ruiz et al., 2000). This complex scenario was caused by the clockwise rotation of the Caribbean Plate from Cretaceous to the present (e.g., Escalona and Mann, 2011; Ardila and Diaz, 2015). The Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto Fold Belt is bounded to the west by the Uramita Fault which separates it from the North Panama Fold Belt (Fig. 1b); to the south it is bounded by the Western and Central cordilleras; to the east, the Romeral Fault Zone separates it from the San Jorge and Plato basins; it is bounded to the north by the Magdalena Fan; to the northeast, it is separated from the Santa Marta Massif by the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga Fault; and to the northwest, the deformation front is responsible for its thrusting over the Colombian Basin. The Sin\u00fa Fault Zone is the eastern boundary of the SFB and the western boundary of the San Jacinto Fold Belt. The SFB developed over a subducting Mesozoic basement (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000; Alfaro and Holz, 2014b) and comprises a Cenozoic sedimentary cover mainly made up of shales with sporadic cherts, sandstones, conglomerates and limestones (Duque-Caro, 1979) (Fig. 2\n). The most important structure is an imbricate system of W-directed thrusts and related folds (Fig. 3\n), as well as piggy-back basins filled with thick sequences of syn-tectonic strata (Kolla et al., 1984; Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Flinch et al., 2003a; Vinnels et al., 2010). The thrusts emanate from a deep main detachment located within deep over-pressured shales, which are the source for mud diapirs and related ductile deformation in the host sediments (Shepard et al., 1968; Ramirez, 1969; Shepard, 1973; Duque-Caro, 1979, 1984; Vernette, 1986; Vernette et al., 1992; Brice\u00f1o and Vernette, 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000). These diapirs, together with normal faults, are mainly developed in the trailing part of the belt (Flinch et al., 2003a,b; Mantilla-Pimiento, 2007).\n\n\n3\nData employed\nSix pre-stack depth migrated seismic lines have been interpreted from the geological point of view although only four are shown here (Fig. 1b). The chosen four lines are approximately perpendicular to the belt, i.e., NW-SE, have an average length of 100\u00a0km and reach a depth of around 22\u00a0km. The spacing between them ranges from 35 to 60\u00a0km. Two additional seismic lines are approximately parallel to the belt, i.e., NE-SW, are more than 800\u00a0km long but we have interpreted around 250\u00a0km, and reach a depth of 22\u00a0km. The spacing between these two lines ranges from 30 to 70\u00a0km. Nowadays, pre-stack depth migration is considered the most accurate method to perform depth conversions of time seismic lines, and that guarantees the precision of the measurements of angles and distances taken in the depth-converted seismic lines.\nIn addition, we have interpreted sixty-one 2D time seismic lines acquired in eight different surveys. These seismic lines exhibit two predominant directions: NW-SE, i.e., approximately perpendicular to the SFB, and NE-SW, i.e., approximately parallel to the SFB. This dataset covers an area of approximately 17,000\u00a0km2, the length of the time seismic sections ranges from 23\u00a0km to more than 400\u00a0km, although most of them exhibit a length in between 50 and 150\u00a0km, and reach two-way travel times from 6 to 8\u00a0s. The spacing between the time seismic lines ranges from 1.5 to 5\u00a0km. Both the depth-converted and the time seismic lines were acquired by the oil companies BP-Amoco, BP Exploration, Intercol, Ecopetrol and Gulf Oil Corporation from 1967 to 2004 and were supplied to us by the company Repsol.\nData from six wells has been employed: a) the Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Site 999 (Sigurdsson et al., 1997), located in the Caribbean Sea approximately 400\u00a0km to the northwest of the SFB deformation front, that penetrates more than 1\u00a0km of Upper Cretaceous-Upper Pleistocene strata (Fig. 1a); and b) five exploration wells, located in the continental shelf about 20\u00a0km from the Colombian coast, that penetrate up to 4.5\u00a0km of Neogene-Quaternary strata (Fig. 1b). The exploration wells in the continental shelf were drilled by the companies Colombian Gulf Oil, Provincia Petroleum, Citco Colombia Petroleum Corporation and Phillips Petroleum from 1969 to 1979 and were supplied to us by Repsol.\nUp to nine stratigraphic units have been defined based on the amplitude, frequency, continuity and geometry of the seismic reflectors (Figs. 2 and 4\n). The software Petrel E&P (Schlumberger), Kingdom Suite (IHS Markit) and Move (Midland Valley-Petroleum Exploration Experts) have been used to carry out the geological interpretation of the seismic data and subsequent data analysis. The specific methodology used to decipher each of the different issues discussed below is explained at the beginning of each section.\n\n\n4\nMain stratigraphic features\nThe study area is made up by a Jurassic to present-day succession (Fig. 2). The Cretaceous to present-day succession is mainly siliciclastic and approximately coarsening upwards (from shales in the lower part to shales, sandstones and some conglomerates in the upper part), as well as shallowing upwards (from deep water sediments evolving upwards to shallow water\/transitional environments). Perpendicularly to the Colombian coast, the thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene succession increases from the abyssal plain (less than 1 km\/more than 3\u00a0km) to the continental shelf (5 km\/almost 6\u00a0km) (Fig. 4). Approximately parallel to the Colombian coast in the continental slope, the Mesozoic-Neogene succession increases from the center-south part of the SFB (Fig. 4c) towards the northeast and southwest, whereas in the continental shelf, it reaches its maximum thickness in the south part (Fig. 4d) and decreases northwards. Although the thickness of the Pliocene-Quaternary sequence is quite variable, approximately perpendicular to the Colombian coast it thickens from the continental slope (approximately 1\u20132\u00a0km) to the continental shelf (almost 3\u20134\u00a0km), i.e., similarly to the pre-Miocene sequence. Approximately parallel to the Colombian coast, the Pliocene-Quaternary succession is thin in the south-central part of the belt and thickens both to the northeast and to the southwest. The different stratigraphic units mapped in the seismic lines are bounded by unconformities. In some localities they become angular unconformities that truncate underlying beds and may be onlapped by overlaying beds.\nIn the Colombian Basin, the Cretaceous and Paleocene successions are syn-rift strata (Fig. 2), although a few normal faults cut and offset Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata. Occasionally, the uppermost Pliocene and Quaternary strata are coeval to the normal reactivation of these older faults.\nThe Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata that constitute the SFB, as well as older underlying rocks, are pre-tectonic with respect to the SFB structures, i.e., they are pre-growth strata (Fig. 2). The Pliocene and Quaternary strata exhibit a number of features diagnostic of syn-tectonic deposition associated with faults, folds and diapirs, and therefore, they are interpreted as growth strata. Nevertheless, the lower part of the Pliocene-Quaternary sequence can be also considered pre-growth or growth, while the upper part can be growth or post-growth strata, so that the stratigraphic position of the boundary between these sequences vary from one structure to another because faults, folds and diapirs developed in the SFB are diachronic (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a; 2022b).\n\n\n5\nMain structural elements of the SFB\nThe SFB is a NE-SW trending fold and thrust belt, more than 200\u00a0km long and around 130\u00a0km wide in its widest part, developed mainly in the continental slope and in the continental shelf offshore northwest Colombia (Fig. 1b). In map view it is a curved belt convex to the northwest (seawards) and it is slightly asymmetric, so that it is wider in the central-north part, and a minor recess and salient occur towards the south (Fig. 3). A NNE-SSW trending and approximately rectilinear fault, named Sin\u00fa Fault Zone, separates the SFB trailing part from the San Jacinto Fold Belt (Figs. 1c and 3). The SFB leading part is separated from the Colombian Basin by the deformation front defined by a frontal thrust or a triangle zone. It exhibits a stepped morphology along strike caused by faults that disrupt its continuity, and is the belt tectonic element that best reflects the belt curved shape (Fig. 3). The SFB is covered by the Magdalena Fan towards the northeast, whereas it ends against the NNW-SSE trending Uramita fault towards the southwest (Fig. 1b). In profile view, the SFB is a wedge bounded by a submarine topography gently inclined to the NW and by a basal detachment gently dipping to the SE (Fig. 4). The wedge apex is located seawards, while the thickest part of the wedge, which may reach more than 10\u00a0km of vertical thickness in the study area, is located landwards. Ductile structures, such as folds and mud diapirs, as well as fragile structures apparently developed under contractional (thrusts), extensional (normal faults) and strike-slip (strike-slip faults) tectonic regimes, occur within the SFB. Some of these structures, such as thrusts, folds, mud diapirs and some normal faults, are longitudinal with respect to the belt, and some of them are transverse, such as tear faults and strike-slip faults (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) (Fig. 3). A brief description of these structures is presented below.\n\n5.1\nContractional structures\nThrusts, together with related folds, are the most abundant longitudinal structures, particularly in the continental slope. Their strike bends from approximately N\u2013S in the south portion of the SFB to NE-SW in the north (Fig. 3). Most thrusts exhibit a listric geometry and form an imbricate thrust system that emanates from a SE gently dipping basal detachment located within Paleocene strata (Fig. 4). Although NW-directed thrusts are the most common structures, a few SE-directed thrusts, i.e., backthrusts, occur. Pop-ups and triangular zones developed in those regions where thrusts and backthrusts coexist. Growth ramp folds, in the form of single-hinge anticlines, box-fold type anticlines and anticlinal monoclines, make up the hangingwall of these thrusts (Fig. 4a, 4b and 4c). Two large anticlines and a syncline, interpreted as growth detachment folds, developed in the SFB south salient (Fig. 4d). The imbricate thrust system and related folds developed according to a roughly forward propagation sequence (piggy-back) from southeast to northwest, both at the scale of a few structures and at the scale of the whole SFB (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a). Sporadic out-of-sequence thrusts are recognized, such as those in the transition from the upper continental slope to the lower continental slope. The basins filled in with Pliocene to present-day growth strata, located above the folds in between thrusts, are piggy-back basins (Fig. 4).\nAn E-W trending fault oblique to the trend of the longitudinal structures, named Canoas fault (Vernette et al., 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000), has been mapped in the north part of the SFB (Fig. 3). The thrusts and related folds developed in the south fault block exhibit different morphologies and are much more abundant than those developed in the north fault block, where there are almost no structures. This fault, developed during recent times, is interpreted as an oblique thrust ramp.\n\n\n5.2\nStrike-slip structures\nSeveral faults, sub-perpendicular to the longitudinal structures, i.e., transverse structures, have been identified in the continental slope (Fig. 3). Their strike ranges from WNW-ESE in the south part of the belt to NW-SE in the north part and they are usually sub-vertical. While the strike of the thrusts and related folds cut by these faults is approximately the same in both fault blocks, the number, spacing and geometry of the thrusts and related folds are different in both fault blocks, and therefore, they have been interpreted as tear faults. The activity of some of these faults ended before the deposition of the youngermost sediments, whereas others are active in recent times.\nThe Rosario Fault (Vernette et al., 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000) is a large fault oblique to the trend of the longitudinal structures, i.e., a transverse structure, developed in the north part of the SFB and in part of the Colombian Basin (Fig. 3). It is a right-lateral, steep fault whose average strike is E-W, and it cuts and offsets thrusts and related folds as well as a tear fault. Its activity is relatively young.\n\n\n5.3\nExtensional structures\nSmall-scale normal faults, involving shallow sediments, developed above the steepest limbs of some anticlines that show bathymetric expression in the continental slope. These faults are longitudinal structures, whose average strike is NNE-SSW in the central part of the SFB and NE-SW in the northern area. Most of them are listric, with dips from moderately to gently to the W and NW (Figs. 3, 4a, 4b and 4c). Some of these NW-directed normal faults branch at depth with a gently NW-dipping detachment, which may be the Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR), i.e., the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (Shipley et al., 1979), forming imbricate normal fault systems. NW-directed, listric thrusts, whose dip varies from gently to moderately to the ESE and SE, emanate from the leading edge of the detachment forming toe thrusts. These normal faults and their associated toe thrusts developed in recent times, and are from simultaneous to younger than the thrusts and related folds.\nLarge listric normal faults, dipping both to the NW and to the SE, have been mapped in the continental shelf (Fig. 3). The average strike of these longitudinal structures ranges from NNE-SSW to NE-SW. Gentle rollover anticlines and sets of second-order normal faults occur in the hangingwall of these normal faults. Some faults root into the basal detachment, whereas others are shallower faults that become horizontal at intermediate depths and become toe thrusts. Some of these normal faults were reactivated as reverse and normal faults, remaining inactive in between fault reactivation periods. These normal faults cut and offset the thrusts and related folds, and some toe thrusts related to these normal faults resulted from reactivation of a portion of previous thrusts. These normal faults developed approximately during middle Pliocene time, and their reactivation took place up to present-day.\n\n\n5.4\nMud structures\nDiapirs are longitudinal structures developed mainly in the continental shelf. They exhibit an elongated shape in map view and their main elongation axis ranges from N\u2013S to NE-SE (Fig. 3). In general, the sidewalls of the diapirs are steeply inclined to vertical (Fig. 4a, 4b and 4d). Some overburden sediments located above the crests of the diapirs and the sediments pierced by the diapirs exhibit anticline geometries caused by the intrusion of the diapirs. Crestal-collapse normal faults developed above some mud diapirs. Mud diapirs occur in the hangingwall and foot wall of thrusts, and in the core of some hangingwall anticlines related to thrusts, so that they probably initiated slightly before or synchronously to the thrusts and related folds from Pliocene to present-day. Some mud diapirs are located close to listric normal faults with related rollover anticlines.\n\n\n\n6\nMain structural features of the Colombian basin\nThe Colombian Basin is a large elongated basin located offshore northwest of Colombia (Fig. 1a). Only the south part of the basin adjacent to the SFB has been studied here. It is filled in by sub-horizontal Cenozoic strata on top of Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary and igneous rocks (Fig. 4). All these rocks are involved in a basement high developed in the south part of the study area (Fig. 5\n). In addition, horsts and grabens bounded by NE-SW faults, that dip from moderately to steeply both to the SE and to the NW, occur (Figs. 3 and 5). These normal faults were active mainly during Cretaceous and Paleocene times, however, some normal faults also cut and offset Eocene, Oligocene and part of the Miocene strata. Some of these normal faults propagated up section in recent times and were active as normal faults.\n\n\n7\nAmount of horizontal tectonic motion\n\n7.1\nPlate motion\nThe shortening responsible for the SFB formation in the study area started in the Pliocene and is still active today according to the age of the syn-contractional strata (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a); this means that this region has been shortened approximately during the last 5.3 Myr. The present-day rates of convergence between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates for this region, estimated by taking GPS measurements during 25 years, are 10\u00a0mm\/yr (Freymueller et al., 1993), 10\u201315\u00a0mm\/yr (Kellogg and Vega, 1995) and 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm\/yr (Trenkamp et al., 2002). Assuming that these plate motion rates (from 10 to 20\u00a0mm\/yr) remained constant during the whole 5.3 Myr of SFB development, and that the South American tectonic plate remained stationary with respect to the Caribbean tectonic plate, then the Caribbean tectonic plate would have moved approximately from 53\u00a0km to 106\u00a0km from Early Pliocene to present-day.\nSome NE-SW normal faults developed during Mesozoic and\/or Paleogene-early Neogene in the south portion of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB deformation front (Fig. 3), reactivated as normal faults during Pliocene-Quaternary time, may furnish information on the rates of SFB development. Thus, we propose that the Caribbean tectonic plate bended as it subducted under the South American tectonic plate and supported the weight of the overlying SFB while it was being emplaced. This lithospheric flexure probably induced extension in the outer portion of the lithosphere flexure hinge resulting in normal faulting, i.e., flexural extension. This extension was not accommodated by new normal faults in the Colombian Basin but by reactivation of old normal faults with favorable orientation, such as the NE-SW faults mapped in the west part of the study area (Figs. 3 and 6\nb) whose strike may be sub-parallel to the flexure hinge. As the Caribbean tectonic plate subducted, the flexure hinge probably migrated away from the continent at a similar rate to that of the SFB advance seawards (Fig. 6a). This would explain why one of the normal faults located closer to the continent (Cretaceous-Paleocene fault reactivated during Pliocene, intersected by section lines C\u2013C\u2032 and D-D\u2032 in Fig. 3) ceased to be active by the end of the Pliocene, while the normal fault located farther away from the continent (Cretaceous-Paleocene fault reactivated during Quaternary, intersected by section line C\u2013C\u2019 in Fig. 3) ended its activity in recent times. Assuming that the lithospheric flexure hinge migrated from southeast to northwest, the distance between these two normal faults measured perpendicularly to their traces depicted on the map in Fig. 3 could reflect the spatial migration of the lithospheric flexure hinge. This distance divided by the time elapsed between the termination of activity of both normal faults might give us an approximate rate of the lithospheric-flexure hinge migration from the end of the Pliocene to the present-day. Since the distance measured between these two faults is 29\u00a0km and the approximate time difference between the termination of activity of both faults is 2.58 Myr, the rate obtained is 11\u00a0mm\/yr. If we assume that the rate of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration is approximately equivalent to the rate of advance of the SFB deformation front, then the rate of advance of the SFB deformation front from Pliocene to Present, obtained using flexure-related normal faults, is in full agreement with the 10\u201320\u00a0mm\/yr rate of convergence between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates for the study area, estimated during 25 years using GPS measurements (Freymueller et al., 1993; Kellogg and Vega, 1995; Trenkamp et al., 2002). Obviously, the rate of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration estimated should be taken with caution since precise ages of the strata are not available and some assumptions may not be totally correct, such as the direction of migration of the lithospheric flexure hinge.\n\n\n7.2\nOverriding plate shortening\nThe Pliocene to present-day shortening responsible for the SFB has been measured in the continental slope and in part of the continental shelf using the four depth-converted seismic profiles sub-perpendicular to the SFB trend (Fig. 4). The boundary between the pre- and syn-contractional sequences has been used to estimate the shortening. This is an easy identifiable, well imaged and continuous reflector, and its age is approximately Lower Pliocene, although it may vary across the belt. The shortening has been estimated as the difference between the length of the folded\/faulted reflector and the cross-section width in between the sub-vertical pin lines located in the Colombian Basin and the sub-vertical loose lines in the continental shelf (Fig. 4). The shortening has been underestimated because: a) strain is likely to have occurred in the shale succession but it has not been accounted for because the measurement method employed assumes constant bed length, b) the shortening has been only estimated in the continental slope and in a portion of the continental shelf adjacent to the continental slope since we do not have depth-converted seismic profiles across the portion of the continental shelf closest to the coast and on land, and c) the significant amount of sediment volume loss due to water expel during accretion (Moore et al., 2011) has not been considered in our estimations. The shortening obtained using the four seismic sections ranges from 11.3\u00a0km to 22.8\u00a0km. These shortening values are apparent values because the seismic profiles are oblique to the tectonic transport vector. They have been converted to true shortening values using Cooper (1983) equations and taking into account the angle between the direction of the seismic lines and the tectonic transport vector (approximately from N110E to N120E, i.e., WNW-ESE according to Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). The true shortening values range from 13.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71\u00a0km to 23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0km, i.e., from almost 19%\u201330% shortening. These values must be taken with caution due to possible errors made in their measurement, in the geological interpretation of the seismic data and in the depth conversion. Our shortening values are lower than those obtained by Ruiz et al. (2000) and Kellogg et al. (2005) based on the analysis of folds and faults depicted in cross sections, which are 60\u201365\u00a0km (40%) and more than 50\u00a0km (40%) respectively; the reason is that our depth-converted sections do not cover the whole SFB from the deformation front to the boundary with the San Jacinto Belt. However, our shortening values are relatively similar to those obtained by Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015) which range from 27.6 to 31.4\u00a0km (27\u201332%). Taking into account that the estimated shortening has been produced during 5.3 Myr and assuming a constant shortening rate, the average shortening rates range from 2.5 to 4.5\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n7.3\nInterplate slip\nThe consistency between the average rates of tectonic plate motion (measured during 25 years) and those of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration (derived from data covering the last 2.58 Myr), both estimated using different methods, makes it reasonable to assume that: a) the plate motion rates measured using GPS during the last 25 years remained approximately constant during the last 2.58 Myr, and perhaps during the whole 5.3 Myr of SFB development, and b) much of the motion of the Caribbean and South American plates has been accommodated at the edge of the plates with not much intraplate deformation. At subduction plate boundaries, strains accumulate within the overriding plate in response to motion of the down-going plate. To a first approximation, the sum of the margin interplate slip and the shortening in the overriding plate is equivalent to the total plate convergence (Nicol and Beavan, 2003) (Fig. 7\n). Therefore, margin interplate slip can be estimated by subtracting the shortening in the overriding plate from the total plate convergence. Assuming that the motion rate of the Caribbean tectonic plate has been approximately constant from 10 to 20\u00a0mm\/yr over the last 5.3 Myr, then the overriding plate shortening values obtained from the seismic lines represent from 13% to 45% of the total Pliocene-Quaternary movement of the Caribbean tectonic plate estimated above. These percentages are minimum values that would increase if considering the strain, plus the sum of all the SFB shortening from the deformation front to the trailing part of the SFB (Sin\u00fa Fault Zone), plus possible mistakes derived from measurements, interpretation and processing. Thus, the remaining 55\u201387% of plate convergence would be the maximum values accommodated by margin interplate slip, i.e., slip on the subduction thrust. This means that the maximum displacement along the basal detachment would range from 29.15 to 92.22\u00a0km. Taking into account that the shortening has been produced during 5.3 Myr and assuming a constant rate of basal detachment displacement, the average rates of basal detachment displacement range from 5.5 to 17.5\u00a0mm\/yr. If the Caribbean-Plate motion rate in the past had been less than the current one and\/or part of the plate movement would have been accommodated by intraplate deformation, then the displacement along the basal detachment would be less. Apparently, the percentage of basal detachment displacement seems very high with respect to the plate convergence, however, similar values have been obtained in other regions, such as the Hikurangi margin located in the boundary between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates, where \u226580% of the convergent component of relative plate motion was accommodated by interplate slip (Nicol and Beavan, 2003).\n\n\n\n8\nAmount of vertical tectonic motion\n\n8.1\nTectonic subsidence\/uplift\nA backstripping analysis has been carried out to estimate the tectonic component of subsidence in both the SFB and the Colombian Basin. The thickness of the stratigraphic units has been measured in the depth-converted seismic profiles. The ages in million years of the stratigraphic tops have been taken from the International Stratigraphic Chart v 2019\/05 (International Commission on Stratigraphy, 2019). Although the different stratigraphic units are separated by unconformities, we have assumed that no hiatuses occur between them, because no accurate information about their ages is available. We have used the same exponential function of porosity variation with depth for all the stratigraphic units, being the c coefficient equal to 0.5 and the porosity at zero depth equal to 50%, because no porosity well logs are available and all the stratigraphic units are mainly made up of shales. We have assumed that the water depth at the time of sedimentation of the different stratigraphic units was the current water depth in the Colombian Basin, because they are interpreted to be deposited in similar deep-water environments. However, since the deposition of the Pliocene and Quaternary sediments was approximately coeval to the SFB formation, we have assumed that the water depth during their deposition in the SFB was the same as it is at their current location. Standard values of density equal to 3.3\u00a0g\/cm3 for the asthenosphere and 1.0\u00a0g\/cm3 for water have been used. Thus, the numerical values obtained for the tectonic subsidence may not be reliable, however, the trend of the functions obtained probably is. The purposes of this analysis are: a) decipher whether tectonic subsidence or uplift occurred in the different regions and at different times, b) identify variations in the tectonic subsidence\/uplift patterns across strike (Colombian Basin-deformation front-continental shelf) and along strike (south part-central part-north part), c) estimate rates and values of tectonic subsidence\/uplift due to the Pliocene-Quaternary SFB development, and d) link the tectonic subsidence\/uplift patterns to geodynamic phenomena derived from the SFB development.\nFirstly, we have compared two tectonic subsidence curves (Fig. 8\na and b), derived from two stratigraphic columns located in two different structural positions within the Colombian Basin (Fig. 8c). These columns are located in the southwestern part of one depth-converted seismic profile approximately parallel to the SFB trend; one in the downthrown hangingwall and the other in the uplifted foot wall of a normal fault that bounds the graben mapped in the northwest part of the seismic section depicted in Fig. 6b. These two columns have helped us to figure out small-scale variations in the tectonic subsidence pattern in the Colombian Basin. All the stratigraphic units from Cretaceous to present-day occur in the downthrown fault-block column, whereas the Eocene and Oligocene are absent in the uplifted fault-block column due to a hiatus or eroded section. The tectonic subsidence was moderate in both columns from Cretaceous to Paleocene when normal faulting with relatively high displacement took place in the Colombian Basin; null in the uplifted fault block and slow in the downthrown fault block during the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, when sporadic normal faults with relatively small displacement still developed in the Colombian Basin; and very fast during Pliocene and Quaternary in both columns when the development of the SFB caused lithospheric flexuring in the Colombian Basin.\nSecondly, we have compared twelve tectonic subsidence curves (Fig. 9\n), derived from stratigraphic columns located in three different structural positions along the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB trend (Fig. 4). Three columns have been built in each profile: one in the Colombian Basin, one in the continental slope adjacent to the SFB deformation front, and one in the continental shelf adjacent to the SFB shelf break (Fig. 7c). Thus, we have obtained four tectonic subsidence curves in the Colombian Basin, four in the deformation front and four in the trailing part of the belt. Our purpose is to characterize large-scale variations, both along and across strike, in the tectonic subsidence pattern as a result of the SFB development. The path of the tectonic subsidence curves derived from the four columns located in the Colombian Basin is very similar (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). Similarly, the tectonic subsidence pattern obtained for the four columns located in the continental slope is similar (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h), and the tectonic subsidence pattern obtained for the four columns located in the continental shelf is almost identical (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9l). Thus, there are no significant differences along strike. According to the twelve curves, the tectonic subsidence is fast during Paleocene, and slow during Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, although it increases from the Colombian Basin to the continental shelf. The main differences occur during Pliocene and Quaternary. In the Colombian Basin, the Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence increases with respect to the Eocene-Oligocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). In the continental slope, the Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence is similar to the tectonic subsidence during the Eocene-Oligocene-Miocene except for the southernmost profile where uplift occurs (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h). In the continental shelf, a pronounced uplift occurs during the Pliocene-Quaternary (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9l). We believe the Colombian Basin suffered a remarkable tectonic subsidence during Pliocene and Quaternary times because it is located on the Caribbean subducting plate that sank below the South-American overriding plate and supported the SFB tectonic and sedimentary load. The Pliocene-Quaternary subsidence near the SFB deformation front was partially compensated by the belt uplift, and therefore, there was little tectonic subsidence or even some small tectonic uplift. A noticeable tectonic uplift took place in the continental shelf during Pliocene and Quaternary due to the SFB development.\nAlthough the numerical values derived from the tectonic subsidence curves are not reliable, the comparison between values obtained in different times and in different regions might be significant. Thus, we have estimated tectonic subsidence\/uplift values during the SFB development by subtracting the tectonic subsidence values obtained at the end of the Miocene from the values obtained during the Pliocene-Quaternary. While there has been tectonic uplift of approximately 0.6\u00a0km in the southern part of the SFB deformation front (Fig. 9e), in the central and northern parts of the deformation front there has been about 0.2\u00a0km of tectonic subsidence (Fig. 9f, g and 9h). In the continental shelf the tectonic uplift ranges from to 2.6\u00a0km in the southern part of the belt (Fig. 9i), to 2.7\u20133\u00a0km in the central part (Fig. 9j and k), to slightly more than 2.2\u00a0km in the northern part (Figure 9l). Thus, the most similar behavior between the deformation front and the continental shelf in terms of subsidence\/uplift has occurred in the southern portion of the belt where uplift has taken place at both sites. On the contrary, in the central portion of the belt, the behavior has been dramatically different with slight subsidence in the deformation front and large uplift in the continental shelf. The behavior has been intermediate in the northern portion of the belt with slight subsidence in the deformation front and moderate uplift in the continental shelf. Since these figures were achieved during a time span of approximately 5.3 Myr, the average rates of tectonic uplift inferred in the most uplifted region, i.e., the continental shelf, range from 0.4 to 0.6\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n8.2\nVertical tectonic thickening\nThe wedge vertical thickness has been estimated at different localities in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB (Fig. 4) and a map of iso-contours of wedge vertical thickness in the continental slope has been constructed by interpolating the available data (Fig. 10\n). The wedge vertical thickness near the deformation front, measured from the seafloor to the basal detachment, is less than 4\u00a0km in the central profiles across the belt and increases to almost 6\u00a0km in the southern profile, and to more than 5\u00a0km in the northern profile (Fig. 10). The wedge vertical thickness near the shelf break is 10\u00a0km in the northern profile and decreases progressively to approximately 9\u00a0km towards the southern profile. Thus, the difference between the wedge vertical thickness measured in the deformation front and in the continental shelf break is maximum in the central profiles across the belt, minimum in the southern profile, and intermediate in the northern profile.\nThe orthogonal thickness of the whole stratigraphic sequence has been measured at different localities in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB (Fig. 4) and an isopach map has been constructed by interpolating the available data (Fig. 10). The amount of vertical tectonic thickening has been estimated by subtracting the orthogonal thickness of the stratigraphic sequence from the wedge vertical thickness at each locality. As expected, the amount of vertical tectonic thickening increases from the deformation front, where it is 0, to values around 0.5\u20132.1\u00a0km in the shelf break area. The stratigraphic thickness contours and the wedge vertical-thickness contours (Fig. 10) are not strictly parallel but intersect each other more than once. This indicates that the sedimentary basin infilling did not fully control the SFB structure, so that variations occurred along strike. The greatest difference between the magnitude of the isopachs and that of the wedge vertical thickness occurs at the central part of the belt, indicating a greater vertical tectonic thickening in this region. The minimum tectonic thickening occurs in the south part of the belt and an intermediate tectonic thickening occurs in the north part. Taking into account that this thickening occurred during a time span of approximately 5.3 Myr, the average rate of vertical tectonic thickening in the most thickened regions has been 0.4\u00a0mm\/yr.\nThe absolute values of horizontal tectonic motion estimated in the section above have been compared with the values of vertical tectonic movement estimated in this section. The total horizontal motion has been estimated as the sum of the SFB shortening and the displacement along the SFB basal detachment. The vertical motion has been estimated as the maximum tectonic uplift. The horizontal component of motion is far greater than the vertical one; thus, the horizontal motion component reaches percentages higher than 90%, whereas less than 10% has been accommodated as vertical motion.\n\n\n\n9\nRecent motion\n\n9.1\nMorphostructure\nThe SFB reaches around 130\u00a0km in width in its central portion, measured from the Sin\u00fa Fault Zone to the deformation front, decreasing towards both edges to approximately 95\u00a0km to the north and 110\u00a0km so the south (Figs. 3 and 11\na). The width of the continental shelf and its adjacent land, measured from the shelf break to the Sin\u00fa Fault Zone, reaches its maximum value (around 75\u00a0km) in the south part of the belt decreasing progressively to approximately 45\u00a0km in the north. The continental slope can be divided into upper continental slope, bounded by the shelf break and a slope break within the continental slope, and lower continental slope, that extends from this slope break within the continental slope to the deformation front (Fig. 11). The width of the whole continental slope, i.e., from the shelf break to the deformation front including both the upper and lower continental slopes, is maximum in the central part of the belt (almost 40\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and almost 30\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope) and decreases both to the north (almost 30\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and almost 15\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope) and to the south (slightly more than 15\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and 0\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope).\nThe dip of the seafloor in the continental shelf and in the abyssal plain changes from less than a degree to slightly more than a degree to the NW, whereas the dip of the continental slope seafloor ranges from slightly less than 2\u00b0 to slightly more than 7\u00b0 to the NW (Fig. 4). The seafloor dip in the upper continental slope, from less than 2\u00b0 to almost 4\u00b0, is lesser than the seafloor dip in the lower continental slope, from slightly more than 3\u00b0 to slightly more than 7\u00b0. The seafloor dip in the upper and lower continental slopes increases from the central part towards both the north and south parts of the belt. The seafloor dip difference in the upper versus the lower continental slope increases from less than 2\u00b0 in the central part of the belt up to almost 5\u00b0 in the north and up to almost 4\u00b0 in the south.\nThe seafloor in the continental shelf and in the abyssal plain is approximately a planar surface, but the continental slope seafloor may be either planar or irregular (Fig. 11). The width of the irregular portion of continental slope seafloor increases progressively from south to north, so that almost no irregularities occur in the south part of the belt, whereas the whole continental slope seafloor is irregular in the north part of the SFB (Fig. 11b). The boundary between regular and irregular bathymetry is oblique to the boundary between the upper and lower continental slope, so that, the seafloor in the upper continental slope displays a more regular bathymetry than that of the lower continental slope.\n\n\n9.2\nNeotectonics\nThe seafloor in the SFB shows evidence of recent superficial processes, such as sedimentation, channel and canyon erosion, slumping, etc. (Vinnels et al., 2010). However, these processes have not been intense enough to mask the bathymetric expression of recent thrusts and related folds, recognized as elongated hills in the case of anticlines and elongated depressions in the case of synclines. Since all the structures involve approximately the same lithologies and submarine erosion is similar throughout the entire SFB, we can assume that an irregular seafloor is due to active underlying structures, while a regular seafloor, either because of erosion or because of structures mantled by sediment fill, indicates that the underlying structures are inactive.\nMany structures located in the east portion of the SFB are not topped by seafloor irregularities, whereas many structures located in the westernmost part of the belt have caused bathymetric irregularities in the seafloor (Figs. 11 and 12\n). This suggests that the tectonic activity responsible for the development of thrusts and related folds propagated from ESE (inactive structures at present) to WNW (active structures in recent times). This is in accordance with the forward or piggy-back sequence of propagation of thrusts and related folds deduced from growth stratal patterns (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022b).\nThe continental slope seafloor in the south edge of the belt is approximately regular, except for the most frontal structure that constitutes the deformation front in this area; thus, only this structure may be presently active, whereas the rest of structures seem to be inactive. The irregular geometry of the whole continental slope seafloor in the north part of the belt suggests that most structures located in this region are presently active (Figs. 11 and 12). The width of the region in which the structures have bathymetric expression, the number of structures developed below the irregular area and the seafloor irregularity is much greater to the north than to the south. This suggests that the tectonic activity of the belt in recent times has been much higher in the north sector of the belt than in the south one. This along-strike variation in tectonic activity could be explained in two different ways. a) If we assume that the Caribbean tectonic plate is slightly rotating clockwise with respect to the South American tectonic plate along an axis located south of the study area, then a larger amount of Caribbean Plate would subduct below the South American Plate in the north part of the SFB than in the south part. b) In the southern profile, the Pliocene and Quaternary sediments are very thick and are distributed throughout the entire profile (Fig. 4d). This could be the result of a possible increased sediment influx during the Pliocene-Quaternary coming from the Atrato River, located south of the study area (Connors, pers. com.). Because of increased sediment, the taper in this region could be maintained (or even be supercritical) without internal tectonic thickening, i.e., without structure activity. If this hypothesis were true, one of the most remarkable consequences would be that uplift produced onshore to the south of the study area could influence the SFB development.\nIn outline, the boundary between regular and irregular bathymetry is not strictly parallel to the strike of the thrusts and related folds developed in the continental slope (Fig. 12). Thus, some structures with no bathymetric expression to the south exhibit bathymetric irregularities to the north, suggesting that the tectonic activity responsible for the development of these particular structures stopped before in the south (inactive part of the structure) than in the north (active part of the structure). This points out that these structures propagated according to a combined frontal and lateral propagation model (Poblet, 2020). Although the available seismic profile grid is not dense enough, it seems that the position of the boundary between active and inactive structures in some localities is controlled by tear faults.\nA positive bathymetric relief, much higher than the adjacent reliefs, developed above a thrust-related anticline located at the boundary between the upper and lower continental slopes in the north (bathymetric profiles 1 and 2 in Fig. 11b) and south-central (bathymetric profiles 6 and 8 in Fig. 11b) parts of the SFB. It is likely that the relief height is somehow related to the amount of thrust displacement and to the age of activity cessation of the underlying structure. Assuming that the temporal factor is the most important controlling parameter, we can state that the structure located at the boundary between the upper and lower continental slopes is younger than the surrounding structures. Thus, this structure would be an out-of-sequence thrust with respect to the general piggy-back thrust sequence. This timing is in accordance with that deduced from growth strata and cross-cutting relationships between this structure and adjacent structures in the geological interpretation of the seismic profiles (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n10\nCritical taper\n\n10.1\nTaper measurements\nThe taper angle is the sum of the bathymetric surface slope (\u03b1), measured from the deformation front to remarkable slope changes within the continental slope or to the continental shelf, and the basal detachment dip (\u03b2) (Davis et al., 1983). A large number of points corresponding to the seafloor and the basal detachment have been digitized in each of the four depth-converted seismic profiles depicted in Fig. 4. These points have been adjusted by linear best-fit functions to calculate the average slope of the submarine topography and the average dip of the basal detachment. The coefficients of determination R2 obtained for the best-fit linear functions vary between 0.8 and almost 1 in the case of the submarine topographic slope, and from 0.9 to almost 1 for the basal detachment dip. The values of these coefficients, very close to 1, guarantee that the linear functions obtained are reasonable.\nThe azimuths of the four depth-converted seismic profiles are N154E for the southernmost one and from N132E to N136E for the other three (Fig. 1b). The azimuth of these seismic profiles is not strictly perpendicular to the bathymetric contours (Fig. 11a) and to the trace of the main longitudinal structures on the structural SFB map (Fig. 3). Thus, the average slope of the submarine topographic surface and the average dip of the basal detachment obtained from the four seismic profiles using best-fit functions are not true but apparent dips. The azimuth of the depth-converted seismic profiles forms an angle from 3\u00b0 to 34\u00b0 with the azimuth of the maximum dip line of the main thrust surfaces and that of the main fold limbs. In order to estimate the true average slope of the submarine topographic surface and the true average dip of the basal detachment from their apparent average dips in the four seismic profiles, the following equation has been used:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\na\nr\nc\nt\na\nn\n\n(\n\nt\na\nn\n\n\u03c6\n\u2032\n\n\/\nc\no\ns\n\u03b3\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the true dip, \u03c6\u2032 is the apparent dip measured on the seismic profile using a best-fit function and \u03b3 is the angle between the seismic profile azimuth and the azimuth of the maximum dip line of the longitudinal main structural elements.\nIn addition, the four sections obtained from the seismic profiles (Fig. 13\n) have been compared with the bathymetric profiles obtained from the bathymetric map to double check them (Fig. 11b). The average dips of the upper and lower continental slopes in the section obtained from the center-south seismic profile (Fig. 13c) are very similar, while these dips are different in the bathymetric profiles perpendicular to the bathymetric contours constructed by ourselves (bathymetric profiles 5, 6 and 8 in Fig. 11b). The center-south seismic profile is more oblique to the SFB trend than the rest of profiles. To sort this out, the geometry of the lower continental slope in this profile has been modified (Fig. 13c) according to a 3D surface generated from our bathymetry and a new true slope has been calculated.\nThe taper angle in the lower continental slope ranges from 6.9\u00b0 to 8.4\u00b0, while it ranges from 5.5\u00b0 to 7.2\u00b0 in the upper continental slope (Fig. 14\n). The taper angle estimated in the lower continental slope decreases from the central-south portion of the SFB to the north edge. This decrease occurs because the detachment dip in the north edge increases but the dip of the lower continental slope decreases more. The taper angle in the upper continental slope remains approximately constant along strike, except for the SFB south edge where it increases. This increase is due to an increment in the dip of the upper continental slope in the south part of the belt, although the detachment dip remains approximately constant along strike.\n\n\n10.2\nEstimations of pore pressure, friction and strength\nThe critical angle is the equilibrium angle established at the leading edge of a wedge that can slide along a basal detachment without undergoing internal deformation (Davis et al., 1983). In the SFB, folds related to thrusts and out-of-sequence thrusts giving rise to marked seafloor irregularities in some localities of the transition zone between the lower and upper continental slope (Fig. 11b) contributed to increase the taper, while normal faults and related toe thrusting, as well as erosional unconformities, developed in some portions of the continental slope and the continental shelf (Figs. 3 and 4) contributed to reduce the taper angle. These observations suggest that the SFB taper angle might have been subcritical in some periods and regions, and supercritical in others. A numerical analysis of the parameters that control the taper angle has been carried out in order to gain insight into the understanding of the causes of the across- and along-strike variations of the SFB taper angle.\nSince the critical angle theory is fulfilled for mechanically homogeneous wedges (e.g., Davis et al., 1983), we have assumed that the SFB is a homogeneous wedge, and this has allowed us to perform a simple analytical approach. The fact that variations in the bathymetric surface inclination are reflected in slight changes in the basal detachment dip (Fig. 13) suggest that the SFB may be a mechanically homogeneous wedge, because in non-mechanically homogeneous wedges variations in the slope of the bathymetric surface are not associated with variations in the basal detachment dip (Suppe, 2007). Of course, the basal detachment dip is not the only determining factor to infer whether a wedge is homogeneous or heterogeneous, since, for instance, variations in the strength of the basal detachment could take place due to lithology and\/or fluid pressure changes. In fact, we must keep in mind that the across- and along-strike variations described by Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015), Rodr\u00edguez (2020) and Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021) rather suggest that the SFB is not strictly a homogeneous wedge. Thus, the results obtained should be taken with caution.\nSince the geometry of a wedge depends on the pore pressure and internal friction (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990), first of all, we have searched the literature for the most appropriate range of values for these physical parameters to be applied to the SFB taking into account its characteristics. We have assumed that the pore pressure in the wedge (\u03bb) is approximately equal to the pore pressure at the detachment (\u03bbb) although we admit that the wedge pore pressure may be up to 10% lower than the detachment pore pressure, and that the friction coefficient in the wedge (\u03bc) is equal or greater than the basal friction coefficient at the detachment (\u03bcb) with a maximum difference of 30% between both values. The minimum pore pressure considered is 0.4, since we assume that the sediments within the wedge are close to the fracturing point, and therefore, their pore pressure must be greater than the hydrostatic pore pressure (\u03bbh\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.4). According to Hubbert and Rubey (1959), a pore pressure equal to 1.0 would correspond to a subaerial wedge in which there is no fluid in the pores. Thus, the value of 1.0 has been discarded for the SFB, but values up to 0.9 have been admitted because these values can be reached in overpressured wedges, such as the Makran (Harms in Davis et al., 1983), Barbados (Moore and Von Huene, 1980), Aleutians (Hottman et al., 1979) and Oregon (Moore and Von Huene, 1980) wedges amongst others. The coefficients of internal friction, estimated from fracturing laboratory experiments, range from 0.6 to 1.0 (Dahlen, 1990), being 0.85 the universal value of Byerlee (1978) for most rocks; their corresponding internal friction angles (\u03c6) are 30\u201345\u00b0. Since the resistance of rocks decreases in saturated samples with high clay content (Morrow et al., 1981), coefficients of friction below 0.6 (equivalent to friction angles below 30\u00b0) have been also admitted because the sediments involved in the SFB include a large amount of clays. Summarizing, the range of values chosen are: a) pore pressure in the wedge (\u03bb) and at the base of the wedge (\u03bbb) from 0.4 to 0.9, b) coefficient of friction in the wedge (\u03bc) and at the base of the wedge (\u03bcb) from 0 to 1, and c) angle of friction (\u03c6) (related to the coefficient of friction \u03bc) from 10\u00b0 to 45\u00b0. All the range of values for the pore pressures, coefficients of friction and friction angles, as well as the dips of the detachment measured in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB trend, have been introduced in equation (86) of Dahlen (1990) to obtain theoretical taper angles (\u03b1+\u03b2), wedge strengths (W) and basal detachment strengths (F). This equation is a useful approximation for wedges with narrow taper angles, where the maximum compressional stress axis is almost horizontal and the basal detachment is very weak. The SFB accomplishes these requirements because: a) the taper angles range from 5.5 to 8.4\u00b0, i.e., they are small, b) thrusts and backthrusts with similar dips coexist, i.e., the maximum compressional stress axis is almost horizontal, and c) shales constitute the detachment horizon, i.e., the basal detachment is very weak. Varying the pore pressure 0.1 units and the friction angles 2\u00b0 each time, we have obtained thousands of theoretical taper angles. These results have been compared with the actual taper values measured in the four depth-converted profiles. At first sight, the best pore pressures, coefficients of friction and strength values would be those whose resulting theoretical taper angles were more similar to the actual taper values measured in the depth-converted profiles, however, more issues need to be considered.\nIn order to determine the most appropriate pore pressure, friction and strength values for the continental slope, solutions that do not meet the following three conditions have been discarded: a) the difference between the taper angles estimated using the equation and those measured in the four seismic profiles must be as low as possible (we have assumed that less than 0.867\u00b0 is a good approximation for the upper continental slope and less than 0.838\u00b0 is a good approximation for the lower continental slope); b) the pore pressure, friction and strength values must be the same for the four transects because we have assumed that the wedge is approximately homogeneous; and c) the wedge pore pressure must be equal to or up to 10% lower than the detachment pore pressure, and the wedge friction coefficient must be equal to or up to 30% higher than the detachment friction coefficient. Three solutions meet these conditions for the upper continental slope and four coincidences have been obtained for the lower continental slope (Table 1\n). We have chosen the solutions whose pore pressure, friction and strength values for the upper continental slope are more similar to those obtained for the lower continental slope following the principle that the wedge is approximately homogeneous (solutions framed by red rectangles in Table 1). The taper angle of the upper continental slope measured in the seismic profiles that differs more from the theoretically estimated taper angle is that of the south profile (underestimated by 0.86\u00b0), whereas the taper angle measured in the seismic profiles that resembles more the estimated taper angle is that of the north profile (overestimated by 0.50\u00b0) (Fig. 15\n). The greatest difference between the theoretically estimated taper angle and the measured taper angle for the lower continental slope occurs in the center-south profile (underestimated by 0.83\u00b0), whereas the minimum difference occurs in the center-north profile (overestimated by 0.30\u00b0) (Fig. 15).\nTo double-check the wedge strength and the basal detachment strength obtained for the active part of the SFB, i.e., mainly the lower continental slope, a technique created by Suppe (2007) has been applied. According to this author, the strength of active, mechanically-homogeneous wedges and the strength of their basal detachments can be directly determined from the linear covariation of surface slope (\u03b1) and detachment dip (\u03b2), without strong assumptions about the specific strength-controlling mechanisms. This strategy has been successfully applied to experimental dry sand wedges, the Niger Delta thrust belt, the Taiwan mountain belt, and a particular thrust responsible for an earthquake. The wedge strength and the basal detachment strength obtained for the lower continental slope of the SFB using the linear best-fit function and equations (3) and (4) of Suppe (2007) is 1.74 and 0.27 respectively, although we must admit that the R2 coefficient is 0.4, which indicates that the fit is not very good as only three data points are available (Fig. 16\n). The difference between the values calculated from combining all the parameters in Dahlen (1990) equation and from the linear covariance strategy of Suppe (2007) is 0.287 for the wedge strength and 0.034 for the basal detachment strength, being always greater the values estimated using the linear covariance method. These small differences point out that the results obtained from both methods are consistent, and suggest that they could be reasonable values since they are similar and have been calculated employing methods unrelated to each other.\nThe values chosen in our simulation of the taper angles for the upper continental slope and for the lower continental slope are identical in terms of basal pore pressure, internal friction, basal friction and fault strength, but they differ in the internal pore pressure (0.6 for the upper continental slope and 0.7 for the lower continental slope) and in the wedge strength (1.93 for the upper continental slope and 1.45 for the lower continental slope). The fact that the calculated internal pore pressure is smaller in the upper continental slope with respect to that of the lower continental slope is in accordance with the taper angle measurements, lower in the upper continental slope and higher in the lower continental slope. Thus, the wedge may not be strictly homogenous, but it does not differ too much because the differences in the values obtained are small. The taper-angle controlling parameters obtained here are different from those deduced by previous authors because: a) the input data and the methodology employed here are different from those of previous authors, b) Toto and Kellogg (1992) analysis is based on five topographic profiles whereas the basal detachment dip is supposed to be a constant value, and c) Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015) employed only two sections across the belt derived from the geological interpretation of seismic profiles.\n\n\n10.3\nTemporal and spatial variations of taper angle and pore pressure\nAs mentioned above, some features in the SFB such as thrusts and out-of-sequence thrusts, normal faults and related toe thrusts, and erosive unconformities are responsible for the modification of the taper angle. Nevertheless, taking into account that the basal pore pressure, the internal friction and the basal friction obtained for the upper and lower continental slopes are equal, while the internal pore pressure is somewhat different (Table 1), it seems reasonable to assume that variations in internal pore pressure may have also contributed to taper angle variations. To illustrate these variations, we have constructed a graph in which the bathymetric slope is plotted versus the basal detachment dip for different internal pore pressure values (Fig. 17\n). The basal pore pressure, internal friction and basal friction values employed to construct the graph (0.7, 1 and 0.8 respectively) are the ones chosen in the section above for both the upper and lower continental slopes. The bathymetric slopes and detachment dips measured for the upper and lower continental slopes in each of the seismic profiles have been plotted on this graph.\nThere is a slight discrepancy, whose maximum value is 0.1 units, between the pore pressure values estimated numerically in the section above (Table 1) and the pore pressure values obtained graphically from the bathymetric slope versus basal detachment dip graph shown in Fig. 17. The numerically-estimated pore pressure for the upper continental slope is 0.6 (Table 1), whereas the graphically-estimated pore pressure is generally lower (comprised between approximately 0.5 and 0.55) (Fig. 17). The reason is that the numerically-estimated taper angles are higher than the measured ones (Fig. 15), except for the south profile in which the graphically-estimated pore pressure is higher (around 0.65) because the numerically-estimated taper angle is lower than the measured one. A similar situation occurs for the lower continental slope where the numerically-estimated pore pressure is 0.7 (Table 1), whereas the graphically-estimated pore pressure is lower (it ranges between 0.65 and 0.7) (Fig. 17) in the north and center-north profiles -in this case the numerically-estimated taper angles are higher than the measured ones-, but on the contrary the numerically-estimated pore pressure in the center-south profile is lower than the graphically-estimated one (it ranges between 0.7 and 0.75) -in this case the numerically-estimated taper angle is lower than the measured one-.\nWe documented above that most structures in the lower continental slope are still active, whereas many structures in the upper continental slope are inactive (Fig. 12). Thus, if the present-day conditions remain constant, as the wedge advances seawards and involves undeformed rocks in the Colombian Basin, a new active lower continental slope may develop eastwards. As a consequence, the present-day, active, lower continental slope might become the inactive upper continental slope in the future, and the present-day, inactive, upper continental slope will become part of the continental shelf. If correct, the graph in Fig. 17 might illustrate the path of the taper angle of the present-day lower continental slope over time in each of the profiles across the belt. Except for the south section where there is no lower continental slope and most structures are inactive, and therefore, we are unable to predict its future evolution, the internal pore pressure of the wedge will decrease from values around 0.65\u20130.7 to values around 0.5\u20130.55 (black dashed arrows in Fig. 17). The manner in which pore pressure decreases will be related to the wedge geometry is different along strike. The internal pore pressure decrease in the central part of the wedge will be high (approximately from 0.15 to 0.2 units) and will be accompanied by a decrease in the seafloor slope and an increase in the basal detachment dip. The internal pore pressure decrease in the north portion of the wedge will be small (0.1 unit) and will go along with a decrease in the seafloor slope while the basal detachment dip will remain constant. As a result, both the taper angle and the internal pore pressure of the different along-strike regions of the SFB will become more similar.\nThree types of regions are recognized in the SFB continental slope based on the spatial variations of the taper angle (Fig. 14) and the internal pore pressure (Fig. 18\n). a) A region with relatively high values of taper angle and internal pore pressure is restricted to the lower continental slope in the center-south part of the SFB. b) Two regions with intermediate values of taper angle and internal pore pressure occupy the lower continental slope in the north and center-north part, as well as the upper continental slope in the south part of the belt. c) A region with relatively low values of taper angle and internal pore pressure is restricted to most of the upper continental slope except for the southernmost part. The maps in Figs. 14 and 18 show that the differences between the taper angle and internal pore pressure in the upper continental slope and those in the lower continental slope are maxima in the center-south part of the belt and decrease northwards where both values approximate each other.\n\n\n10.4\nRelationships between pore pressure and sediment thickness\nAs we will see below, some structural and bathymetric differences have been recognized in the SFB continental slope from north to south, however, the greatest difference corresponds to the sediment thickness (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). This is why we suggest that sediment thickness may be one important controlling parameter of pore pressure variations.\nThe pore pressure in the lower continental slope is higher than in the upper continental slope (Figs. 17 and 18). Thus, the degree of compaction of the sediments in the upper continental slope is greater, because the greater grain packaging the larger fluid loss and the larger pore pressure reduction. This is consistent with the fact that the stratigraphic succession prior to the SFB formation, as well as the succession coeval to the SFB formation, is substantially thicker in the upper continental slope than in the lower continental slope (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) (Fig. 10). Perhaps the fact that the structures in the upper continental slope are generally older than those developed in the lower continental slope (Fig. 12), has favored an additional compaction due to tectonic load, which has taken place to a much lesser extent in the lower continental slope (Fig. 10).\nThe pore pressure in the upper continental slope is similar in the north, center-north and center-south profiles, whereas it is higher in the south profile (Figs. 17 and 18). The main along-strike stratigraphic difference in the upper continental slope is the lesser thickness of strata deposited before the development of the SFB in the southern part (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) which probably suffered little compaction, i.e., the pores were hardly modified and little fluid was expelled. The high and fast sediment supply in this region during the SFB development (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) may have caused a load increase on uncompacted sediments with open pores preventing fluid scape (e.g., Saffer and Bekins, 2006; Shi and Wang, 1985) leading to a pore pressure increase. The presence of more mud diapirs in the south portion of the upper continental slope (Fig. 3) supports the hypothesis of a higher pore pressure.\nThe pore pressure in the lower continental slope is similar in the north and center-north profiles, whereas it is much higher in the center-south profile (Figs. 17 and 18). The main along-strike stratigraphic difference in the lower continental slope is the extremely thinner sedimentary succession in the center-south profile with respect to the rest of profiles (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). Similarly to the southern part of the upper continental slope, the thin sedimentary succession previous to the SFB formation probably suffered little compaction. Thus, the fast deposition of sediments synchronous to the SFB formation above poorly compacted sediments caused a notable increase in pore pressure in the center-south region.\n\n\n10.5\nDiscussion on the taper angle analysis\nThe taper angle analysis performed above assumes an approximate homogeneous wedge, with basal pore pressure, and coefficients of internal and basal friction being constant everywhere, and admits that the variation in pore pressure in the wedge relative to the basal pore pressure can reach a 10%. No significant differences between the pore pressure in the wedge and the pore pressure at the detachment have been considered due to the reasons below.\n\na)\nThe equality between pore pressures in the wedge and at the detachment is supported by measurements taken in some wedges such as Taiwan (Suppe and Wittke, 1977), as well as by successful analyses of the taper angle in Taiwan (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990; Dahlen et al., 1984), Barbados (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990), and other belts such as the Himalayas, Japan, Peru, Java, Sunda, Guatemala, Aleutians, Oregon, and Makran (Davis et al., 1983).\n\n\nb)\nIn all the analyses of the SFB taper angle carried out up to date (Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) the pore pressures in the wedge and at the detachment are considered to be equal. Thus, we have followed this assumption suggested by other authors.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, we are aware that, for example, in the Nankai accretionary wedge, the fluid pressure in the wedge is lower than at the basal detachment. Thus, the pore pressure measured within the wedge is 0.58 (Kitajima et al., 2017), whereas the pore pressure near the megathrust fault at the base the wedge reaches approximately 0.85 (Kitajima and Saffer, 2012), so that its variation is slightly greater than 30%. Thus, in order to explore more possibilities in the SFB, we have relaxed the conditions; we have eliminated the limits to the difference between the values of pore pressure in the wedge and at detachment, and between the values of the coefficient of friction in the wedge and at detachment, as long as the theory is fulfilled, i.e., the wedge pore pressure must be equal to or less than the detachment pore pressure, and the wedge coefficient of friction must be equal to or greater than the detachment coefficient of friction. We have looked for those combinations of values whose: a) taper angle obtained is equal to that measured in the seismic profiles or whose difference is less than 0.838\u00b0 and 0.867\u00b0 in the lower and upper continental slope respectively, b) the basal detachment strength and the wedge strength obtained for the lower continental slope are equal to the values obtained using Suppe (2007) best-fit function or their difference is less than 0.04 and 0.3 respectively, and c) the values of the pore pressure and coefficients of friction obtained for the lower and upper continental slopes are as similar as possible. The result obtained is the same as with the more restrictive conditions. This means that the results obtained in relation to these parameters do not depend on the starting assumptions used regarding the limits imposed to the difference between the pore pressures at the wedge and at the detachment, and the coefficients of friction at the wedge and at the detachment.\nIn order to estimate the pore pressure, friction and strength values from the taper angle analysis, we have assumed that the four cross sections presented have reached a critical taper state. However, this might not be the case in the particular situations listed below.\n\na)\nAccording to our results there is higher pore pressure in the lower continental slope relative to the upper slope in the center-south, center-north and north profiles across the belt (Figs. 17 and 18). Another possibility is that the lower continental slope is subcritical and has not reached the critical taper yet. Consistent with this is the fact that this is the area of active deformation with thrusts breaching the seafloor (Fig. 12), and therefore, thickening this part of the wedge.\n\n\nb)\nOur results point out that the pore pressure in the upper continental slope is higher in the south profile than in the rest of profiles (Figs. 17 and 18). This region is the least deformed (Fig. 4), however, one would expect the opposite considering the higher pore pressure. As mentioned in a section above, the occurrence of a thick Pliocene-Quaternary succession all along the south profile may suggest an increased sediment supply by the Atrato River. Because of increased sediment, the taper could be maintained, or even be supercritical, without internal tectonic thickening. This could explain why this section is less deformed despite having a higher pore pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\nAseismic subduction and trench absence\nThe SFB has been interpreted as the front of the westernmost portion of an accretionary prism, known as South Caribbean Deformed Belt, developed as a consequence of the subduction of the Caribbean tectonic plate underneath the South American tectonic plate. This region exhibits at least two peculiarities with respect to other subduction zones: low seismicity related to the subduction zone and absence of a trench near the deformation front.\nAccording to available earthquake catalog compiled by the Arcila Rivera (2018), there have been very few earthquakes in the study area from 1610 to 2014, and their hypocenters are located at depths relatively close to the boundary between the subducting and the overriding plates. Given that the SFB slip rate calculated above is small (average shortening rate in the overriding plate from 3 to 5\u00a0mm\/yr, and average rate of basal detachment displacement from 6 to 17\u00a0mm\/yr) and that young sediments (Pliocene and Quaternary), probably under-compacted and with a high porosity, subduct, this may prevent brittle shear localization. This probably reduces the width of the seismogenic zone resulting in aseismic subduction (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Zhang et al., 1993).\nThe geological interpretation of the seismic profiles shows no trench separating the subducting and overriding tectonic plates (Fig. 4). The absence of a trench could be explained as the result of a very slight bending of the subducting plate as shown by the gentle dips of Colombian Basin reflectors in this region (Fig. 4). The reason for this gentle bending is that the Caribbean Plate subducts with a very low dip under the South American Plate (e.g., Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015). Moreover, very few normal faults were active in the Colombian Basin during the development of the SFB (Fig. 3) and their displacement was very small indicating a small amount of extension. Assuming that these faults developed as a consequence of the flexure in the outer part of the lithospheric flexure hinge, this also supports a gentle bending of the subducting plate.\n\n\n12\nMorphostructural zoning\n\n12.1\nAcross strike regions\nThe study area displays variations from northwest to southeast, i.e., perpendicularly to the SFB trend, in terms of bathymetry, stratigraphy and tectonics. Thus, apart from the portion of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB, three regions have been identified within the SFB: a) the lower continental slope, b) the upper continental slope, and c) the continental shelf. The principal characteristics of these zones are illustrated in Fig. 19\n and mentioned in Table 2\n, and their main differential features are described below from the outer to innermost zones using our own data and data from Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021).\n\n12.1.1\nColombian Basin versus SFB\nThe Colombian Basin, developed in the abyssal plain, is located in front of the SFB. The SFB deformation front, which coincides with a slope change, separates it from the SFB, developed in the continental slope, the continental shelf and the onshore area (Figs. 3, 4, 11 and 13). The seafloor in the Colombian Basin is sub-horizontal to gently inclined to the NW (0.3\u20131.4\u00b0) and very regular because only few isolated faults and folds exhibit bathymetric expression, while the seafloor in the SFB reaches greater dips and may be very irregular (Figs. 4, 11 and 13). The Colombian Basin is constituted by a thin succession of Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata over Jurassic rocks, whose thickness increases towards the SFB, while the SFB is made up of a thicker Cenozoic succession which also thickens landwards (Fig. 4). In general, most of the Cenozoic strata are undeformed in the Colombian Basin, while they are quite deformed in the SFB (Fig. 4). Normal faults developed during Cretaceous-Paleocene time, some of them affecting Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata, and some of them reactivated as normal faults during recent times, are the most common structures in the Colombian Basin (Figs. 3\u20135). On the contrary, thrusts and related folds, tear faults, different types of normal faults and mud diapirs occur within the SFB. Tectonic subsidence was fast during Paleocene both in the Colombian Basin and in the SFB, and slow during Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, although it increases towards the SFB (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). Moderate tectonic subsidence occurred during Pliocene and Quaternary in the Colombian Basin, while slow tectonic subsidence and fast tectonic uplift occurred in the SFB.\n\n\n12.1.2\nSFB lower continental slope\nThe lower continental slope is the most external zone of the SFB. A slope change constitutes the boundary between the lower continental slope and the upper continental slope (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). In this area, the seafloor is the most inclined and irregular of the entire SFB, because many structures are still active (Figs. 11\u201313). This region is formed by the thinnest Cenozoic succession of the SFB (Figs. 4 and 10). Structures such as backthrusts and related folds, continental-slope normal faults with associated toe thrusts, and normal faults reactivated as reverse faults including related folds only occur in this domain (Figs. 3 and 4). The average thrust spacing is intermediate between that of the upper continental slope and that of the continental shelf. Both the thrust dip and displacement are the smallest ones of the entire SFB. The Pliocene-Quaternary piggy-back, syn-tectonic basins related to fold growth and thrust emplacement are the shallowest and narrowest. The dip of the basal detachment, where thrusts branch at depth forming an imbricate thrust system, the depth to the basal detachment, the wedge vertical thickness and the vertical tectonic thickness compared to the original stratigraphic thickness are the smallest of the whole SFB (Figs. 4, 10 and 13). The slowest Eocene-Miocene and Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence and the slowest Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift of the whole SFB occurred in this region (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h). Both the taper angle and the internal pore pressure are the highest of the entire SFB (Figs. 14, 15, 17 and 18, and Table 1).\n\n\n12.1.3\nSFB upper continental slope\nThe upper continental slope is the intermediate zone of the SFB. The shelf break, which is a slope change, separates the upper continental slope from the continental shelf (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). The seafloor dips less and exhibits less irregularities than the lower continental slope but it dips more and is more irregular than the continental shelf, since some structures developed near the upper-lower continental slope boundary are still active (Figs. 11\u201313). The Cenozoic strata that constitute this region exhibit intermediate thicknesses between those of the lower continental slope strata and those of the continental shelf strata (Figs. 4 and 10). The most important out-of-sequence thrusts occur in this region and constitute the boundary between the upper and the lower continental slopes. The average thrust spacing is the smallest one of the study area (Figs. 3 and 4). Both the thrust dip and displacement are the highest ones. The depth and width of the Pliocene-Quaternary piggy-back, syn-tectonic basins related to folds and thrusts are intermediate in between those of the lower continental slope and those in the continental shelf. The thrusts branch at depth with the basal detachment forming an imbricate thrust system, and the dip of the detachment is the steepest one. The depth to detachment, the wedge vertical thickness, and the vertical tectonic thickness versus the stratigraphic thickness are intermediate values in between those of the lower continental slope and those of the continental shelf (Figs. 4, 10 and 13). Intermediate Eocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence and intermediate Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift between those of the lower continental slope and those of the continental shelf occurred in this region. The taper angle and the internal pore pressure are the smallest of the SFB (Figs. 14, 15, 17 and 18, and Table 1).\n\n\n12.1.4\nSFB continental shelf\nThe continental shelf is the most internal zone of the SFB (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). The seafloor is the less inclined and most regular of the SFB, since most structures are inactive (Figs. 11\u201313). This domain is made up by the thickest Cenozoic succession of the SFB (Fig. 4). Most the mud diapirs and shale cored anticlines with crestal normal faults, and continental-shelf normal faults, some of them reactivated as reverse faults or as normal faults several times, only occur in this domain (Figs. 3 and 4). The average thrust spacing is the largest one. The Pliocene-Quaternary basins filled in with young syn-tectonic strata are the deepest and widest of the entire SFB. The dip of the basal detachment, from which thrusts emanate, the depth to the basal detachment, the wedge vertical thickness, and the vertical tectonic thickness versus the stratigraphic thickness are the greatest of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13). The fastest Eocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence and the fastest Pliocene and Quaternary tectonic uplift of the entire SFB occurred in this region (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9\u00a0l).\n\n\n\n12.2\nAlong strike regions\nApart from variations from the external to the internal zones of the belt, there are also along-strike changes, i.e., from southwest to northeast, in terms of characteristics of the structures, as well as stratigraphic and bathymetric features. The belt could be divided into three different regions: a) a south region, which is the south salient under the influence of the Uramita Fault; b) a central region, which is the proper SFB s.s.; and c) a north region under the influence of the Magdalena Fan and Canoas Oblique Ramp. The most important characteristics of these zones are illustrated in Fig. 20\n and presented in Table 3\n, and their main differential features are described below from south to north using our own information plus Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021) data.\n\n12.2.1\nSouth salient influenced by the Uramita Fault\nThis region corresponds to the south part of the SFB; an entrant separates it from the SFB s.s. to the north, and the Uramita Fault separates it from the North Panama Belt to the south (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). This portion of the belt is narrower than the SFB s.s. but similar to the north region. Unlike the rest of zones, only upper continental slope occurs in this region. The dip of the seafloor in the continental shelf is the lowest of the entire SFB, whereas that of the portion of the Colombian Basin just in front of this region is the highest (Table 3). The bathymetry of the continental slope is the most regular of the belt suggesting almost no recent tectonic activity (Figs. 11 and 12). The Cretaceous-Miocene strata exhibit an intermediate thickness in the frontal part and the highest near the shelf break, so that the 2\u00a0km difference between both thicknesses is intermediate (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the sedimentary succession that fills in piggy-back basins is the thickest one. The vertical thickness of the wedge in the deformation front is the highest, whereas in the shelf break is the lowest, and therefore, the vertical thickness in the shelf break is almost 1.5 times that of the deformation front, i.e., the lowest of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening, i.e., the vertical thickness minus the stratigraphic sequence thickness, is also the lowest. The basal detachment exhibits the highest dip beneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is intermediate and the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is the lowest, thus the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is slightly more than 1 time that beneath the deformation front, being the lowest ratio of the entire SFB. Thrusts and thrust-related folds exhibit an approximately N\u2013S strike, and their average spacing in the deformation front is the lowest together with that of the SFB s.s., whereas in the shelf break is the highest (Fig. 3). The variation between the thrust spacing in the deformation front and in the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, is the smallest one of the whole SFB. An intermediate number of tear faults and mud diapirs with related crestal normal faults and folds occur in this region, while the number of continental-shelf normal faults is the lowest (Fig. 3). The deformation front in the south salient is made up of large detachment folds and a few, minor WNW-directed thrust faults emanating from the basal detachment (seaward-vergent structures) (Fig. 4). The shortening measured here is the smallest of the entire SFB. Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift in the deformation front occurred in this region in contrast to the tectonic subsidence occurred in the other regions; the uplift in the continental shelf is an intermediate value. Thus, this region exhibits the most similar behavior between the deformation front and the shelf break in terms of subsidence\/uplift because uplift has taken place at both sites (Fig. 9). The taper angle measured in the upper continental slope (Figs. 14 and 15) and the pore pressure value estimated in the upper continental slope are the highest ones of the whole belt (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n12.2.2\nSFB s.s\nThis region is the central portion of the SFB separated by a gradual boundary with the north part of the belt, and by an inlet from the south salient (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). The SFB s.s. is the widest portion of the belt. The ratio between the width of the upper continental slope and that of the lower continental slope is extremely variable from less than 1 to 6 times the width of the lower continental slope. The dip of the lower continental slope seafloor may be up to 4 times that of the upper continental slope. The dip of the continental shelf is intermediate between that of the north and south regions, and that of the Colombian Basin in front of this region is the lowest (Table 3). The degree or irregularity of the bathymetry of the continental slope is intermediate in between that of the north and south regions (Figs. 11 and 12). The thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene strata in the frontal part is the lowest and it is intermediate near the shelf break, so that the difference between both thicknesses from 3 to 5\u00a0km is the highest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the succession that fills in piggy-back basins is the thinnest one of the whole SFB. The wedge vertical thickness in the deformation front is the lowest and is intermediate in the shelf break, and therefore, the wedge vertical thickness in the shelf break ranges from almost 2.5 to slightly more than 3 times that of the deformation front, and is the most pronounced ratio of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening is intermediate. The basal detachment dip beneath the lower continental slope is the lowest one of the entire SFB, but increases to the highest values beneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is the lowest and the depth beneath the shelf break is intermediate; the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is from almost 1.5 times to almost 2 times higher than that beneath the deformation front, being the highest ratio of the entire SFB. The strike of the thrusts and related folds is NNE-SSW, and their average spacing around the deformation front is the lowest together with that of the south region, whereas in the shelf break is the lowest (Fig. 3). The 1\u20132\u00a0km difference between the average thrust spacing in the deformation front versus the one at the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, are the highest ones of the whole SFB. The largest number of tear faults, mud diapirs with related crestal normal faults and shale cored anticlines, and continental-shelf normal faults occur in this region (Fig. 3). The deformation front in the SFB s.s. consists of a symmetrical triangular zone made up of SE-directed thrusts (backthrusts) (landward-vergent structures) in the outer part, and NW-directed thrusts (seaward-vergent structures) in the inner part, all of them emanating from the basal detachment. In some portions of the SFB s.s., the deformation front is a poorly developed triangular zone formed by an imbricate thrust system with sporadic backthrusts (Fig. 4). The shortening measured is the highest of the entire SFB. The maximum amount of tectonic subsidence during Pliocene-Quaternary times in the deformation front occurred in this region together with the north region, and the maximum amount of tectonic uplift in the continental shelf also occurred in this region. Therefore, this region is where the behavior of these two sites in terms of tectonic subsidence\/uplift is the most different (Fig. 9). The taper angle in both the upper and the lower continental slopes are the lowest, and the 1.4\u00b0\u20132.7\u00b0 difference between both taper angles is the highest one of the entire SFB (Figs. 14 and 15). The value of pore pressure in the upper continental slope is the lowest and is the highest in the lower continental slope; thus, the 0.15\u20130.2 difference between both values is the highest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n12.2.3\nRegion influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp\nThis region is the northern part of the SFB, whose boundary to the north is the Magdalena Fan and the Canoas Oblique Ramp, while its southern boundary with the SFB s.s. is diffuse (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). The width of this part of the belt is smaller than that of the SFB s.s. but similar to that of the south salient. The width of the upper continental slope is more than 2.5 times that of the lower continental slope. The dip of the lower continental slope seafloor is from 2.5 to 3.5 times that of the upper continental slope. The dip of the continental shelf is the highest of the whole SFB, whereas that of the Colombian Basin in front of this region is intermediate (Table 3). The bathymetry of the continental slope is the most irregular of the SFB suggesting a lot of recent tectonic activity (Figs. 11 and 12). The thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary pile is the highest in the frontal part and the lowest in the shelf break, and therefore, the 0.5\u00a0km difference between both thicknesses is the lowest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the thickness of the strata that fill in piggy-back basins is intermediate. The wedge vertical thickness in the deformation front is intermediate and is the highest in the shelf break, and thus, the wedge vertical thickness in the shelf break is 2 times that of the deformation front, which is an intermediate value between that of the SFB s.s. and that of the south salient (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening is the highest of the SFB. The basal detachment exhibits the highest dip underneath the lower continental slope which becomes the lowest underneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is intermediate and that beneath the shelf break is the highest, and therefore, the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is almost 1.5 times that beneath the deformation front, being this an intermediate value. The strike of the thrusts and related folds is approximately NE-SW, and their average spacing measured near the deformation front is the highest, whereas around the shelf break is intermediate (Fig. 3). The 1.5\u00a0km difference between the thrust spacing in the deformation front and in the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, are intermediate values. Tear faults are almost non-existent. The lowest number of mud diapirs including crestal normal faults and folds, and an intermediate number of continental-shelf normal faults, occur in this region. Several structures branch northwards with the Canoas Oblique Ramp (Fig. 3). The deformation front is an asymmetrical triangular zone because the outermost part of the deformation front consists of a SE-directed thrust (backthrust) and a thrust that branches with the backthrust forming a pop-up, whereas the innermost part of the deformation front is made up of NW-directed thrusts (seaward-vergent structures), all of them emanating from the basal detachment (Fig. 4). The shortening measured is an intermediate value. The maximum amount of tectonic subsidence during Pliocene-Quaternary in the deformation front occurred in this region together with the SFB s.s. region, whereas the minimum amount of tectonic uplift in the continental shelf occurred here as well. Thus, the behavior of the deformation front compared to that of the shelf break in terms of tectonic subsidence\/uplift is intermediate (Fig. 9). The taper angle measured in the upper continental slope is intermediate, whereas in the lower continental slope is the lowest, and thus, the 1.3\u00b0 difference between taper angles is the smallest one of the entire SFB (Figs. 14 and 15). The value of estimated pore pressure in the upper continental slope is intermediate and is the lowest in the lower continental slope; the 0.1 difference between both values is the smallest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n\n\n13\nConclusions\nThe post-Jurassic evolution of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB consisted of a Cretaceous-Paleocene extensional event with considerable tectonic subsidence, followed by a slower subsidence event of Eocene-Miocene age during which some normal faults were still active. During Pliocene-Quaternary, the SFB development caused a lithospheric flexure of the Caribbean Plate, accompanied by normal reactivation of previous faults (i.e., flexural extension), which induced high tectonic subsidence in the Colombian Basin.\nThe SFB was initiated by the beginning of Pliocene in the study area and is still active today at a rate of several millimeters per year. The SFB resulted mostly from horizontal motion, mainly displacement along the basal detachment as well as some overriding plate shortening, accompanied by a minor component of vertical motion responsible for tectonic uplift and thickening. The number of active thrusts and related folds increases from the trailing part of the belt to the deformation front supporting a forward propagation sequence. It also varies along strike from the almost inactive salient in the south portion of the belt to the active continental slope in the north part, suggesting a possible slight clockwise rotation of the subducting Caribbean Plate or a possible increased sediment influx due to the Atrato River in the south part of the belt inhibiting structure activity. The SFB can be considered as an approximately homogeneous wedge whose basal pore pressure, and coefficients of internal and basal friction are roughly constant everywhere, whereas the pore pressure is lower in the upper continental slope causing a lower taper angle in the upper continental slope than in the lower continental slope. The small motion rate of the belt and the subduction of highly porous sediments caused an aseismic subduction, and the gentle flexure of the subducting plate prevented the development of a trench. The longitudinal and transversal variations in terms of bathymetry, stratigraphy and structure have allowed us to divide the SFB in three morpho-structural regions across strike: lower continental slope, upper continental slope and continental shelf, and three regions along strike: north region influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp, SFB s.s. and south salient influenced by the Uramita Fault.\nInterpreting seismic profiles across the SFB from the geological point of view with the aid of well logs, quantifying amounts of shortening and basal detachment displacement, carrying out a backstrippping analysis in order to quantify tectonic subsidence\/uplift and vertical tectonic thickening, relating the morphological features to the underlying structure, quantifying the taper angle and their causal parameters in different portions of the belt, as well as establishing a SFB zoning both along and across strike, have proven to be efficient strategies to gain insight into the large-scale structure and evolution of the SFB. These aspects are not only important from the purely scientific point of view but also from the industry point of view because they may be a valuable tool to improve the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons recently reactivated in his region (see Reuber et al., 2021). For instance, the large-scale analysis of the SFB carried out here, especially with regard to tectonic subsidence\/uplift and tectonic thickening, may be useful in obtaining burial data, and therefore, could help in establishing the hydrocarbon generation and migration. In addition, the large-scale history of SFB presented here may serve as analogue for other submarine regions developed under a similar tectonic setting but whose available data are scarcer or of poorer quality.\n\n","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nCarbonate slopes represent highly variable depositional settings comprising large portions of carbonate platforms. They contain a broad range of depositional geometries ranging from gently dipping ramps to sub-vertical accretionary margins with associated steep slopes forming in response to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic controls (McIlreath and James, 1978; Ahr, 1973; Schlager and Ginsburg, 1981; Cook and Enos, 1977; Cook and Mullins, 1983; Kenter, 1990; Adams and Schlager, 2000; Playton et al., 2010). Sedimentation patterns in slope settings preserve records of factors affecting carbonate environments and subsequent growth history of carbonate platforms. However, while slope environments may record the influence of varying autogenic and allogenic controls on carbonate platform growth, they often display complex stratigraphy and are more difficult to interpret than shallow water systems (Playton et al., 2010).\nControls on slope morphology and changes in growth patterns are controlled by available accommodation on the platform, sediment budget, slope height (platform to basin relief), directions of offbank transport, presence of binding organisms at the margin and on the slope, rates of early marine cementation, tectonic adjustment, rates of sea level change, subsidence, grain type and composition, and position of buried antecedent topography and oceanic currents (Schlager and Camber, 1986; Eberli and Ginsburg, 1989; Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999; Kenter, 1990; Grammer and Ginsburg, 1992; Drzewiecki and Simo, 1997; Adams and Schlager, 2000; Whalen et al., 2000; Playton and Kerans, 2002; Della Porta et al., 2003; Playton and Kerans, 2006; Kerans et al., 2013; Betzler et al., 2014; Playton and Kerans, 2015a, b; Hurd et al., 2016; Playton and Kerans, 2018)). Changes in dominant controls over time lead to the potentially complex evolution of slope profiles. Historically, precise spatial and temporal assessment of carbonate slope environments have been limited due to scarcity of high-quality datasets. Outcrops provide the highest data resolution and allow for detailed description of morphology, composition, and architectural elements of slope environments (Cook et al., 1972; Bosellini, 1984; Eberli et al., 1993; Playton and Kerans, 2002; Verwer et al., 2009; Kerans et al., 2013; Playton and Kerans, 2015a, b). However, these studies are limited by scale, often present two-dimensional views of the system, and rarely have significant three dimensionality to assess both temporal and spatial changes. Seismic data is ubiquitous for subsurface interpretations and aids in assessment of carbonate slopes. While vertical resolution may be limited, it often has good spatial coverage, excellent depth coverage, and allows for assessment of geometries and growth patterns of slope evolution (Eberli and Ginsburg, 1989; Sarg, 1989; Saller and Vijaya, 2002; Janson et al., 2010, 2011). However, two-dimensional seismic only provides cross-sectional views which limit assessment of spatial changes, and three-dimensional data is cost-prohibitive to acquire large-scale volumes necessary for regional-scale characterization of variations in slope morphology. In modern settings, multibeam surveys and side-scan sonar provide 3-d spatial data with excellent resolution of slope profiles (Mulder et al., 2012, 2017; Jo and Eberli, 2015; Principaud et al., 2015; Tournadour et al., 2015, 2017; Counts et al., 2018). It allows for characterization of variability in modern slopes, but it must be coupled with additional data such as 2-D seismic and core to evaluate temporal changes.\nThe Permian Basin provides a unique setting to assess controls on carbonate slope evolution. Permian strata in the basin comprise a thick succession of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic deposits. The basin also contains a broad assemblage of varying and evolving Permian-aged carbonate slopes (Kerans et al., 2013). It is one of the world's leading petroleum provinces with oil and gas exploration and production dating back a century. As such, significant volumes of subsurface data in the form of well logs, 2-D and 3-D seismic, and cores are available for slope analysis. Also, lower to middle Permian slope strata outcrop along the southern and western margin of the basin in the Glass Mountains, Wiley Mountains, Baylor Mountains, Sierra Diablo Mountains, and Guadalupe Mountains. In particular, studies on slopes in the Sierra Diablo and Guadalupe Mountains (King, 1948, 1965; Pray, 1988; Fitchen et al., 1995; Kerans and Fitchen, 1995; Kerans, 2001; Kerans and Kempter, 2002; Playton and Kerans, 2002, 2006; Kerans et al., 2013; Hurd et al., 2016) as well as the subsurface equivalent units (Gawloski, 1987; Mazzullo and Reid, 1987; Sarg, 1989; Saller et al., 1989; Hurd et al., 2018) provide varying scales of investigation of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic Wolfcampian and Leonardian slopes from detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy to broad-scale growth patterns. These works aid in generating a strong framework on which to continue assessment.\nThis study presents a regional analysis of the northern Delaware Basin focused on late Pennsylvanian and early to middle Permian intervals. The research aims to characterize temporal and spatial variability in carbonate slope and margin growth patterns in Wolfcampian and Leonardian (Asselian-Kungurian) strata across the northern Delaware basin using existing subsurface gamma-ray well-log data. This study used the extensive dataset to generate detailed regional cross sections and maps of the Northern Delaware Basin to reconstruct the regional evolution of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic slope in a tectonically active basin to better constrain the spatial and temporal variations in carbonate slope architecture and subsequent sediment routing to the deeper basin. This work also aims to identify the mechanisms driving variations in slope depositional patterns along strike. While existing studies in the Permian Basin assess local variations in margin and slope growth patterns, this is one of the first studies attempting to define variations regionally. The end results should provide a framework for continued studies on detailed studies on the internal heterogeneity of the slopes. Also, this is the first study in this basin or any other basin leveraging subsurface well log data as the primary tool for characterizing regional strike variability in carbonate slopes at this scale.\n\n\n2\nGeologic background\nThe Delaware Basin represents the western subdivision of the greater Permian Basin. It is bounded to the west by the Diablo Platform, to the north by the Northwest Shelf, to the east by the Central Basin Platform, and to the south by the Marathon orogenic belt (Fig. 1\n). Early Paleozoic extension in the region resulted in formation of the Tobosa Basin which pre-dates the currently defined Permian Basin (Galley, 1958; Adams, 1965; Ewing, 2019). Tectonics were relatively quiescent during the early to middle Paleozoic with the first pulses of tectonism associated with Ancestral Rocky Mountain and later Ouachita-Marathon collision occurring during the late Mississippian-early Pennsylvanian (Yang and Dorobek, 1995; Ewing, 2019). The northern portions of the Delaware Basin remained relatively unaffected until middle to late Pennsylvanian when collision resulted in maximum fault displacement and differential subsidence became more active (Yang and Dorobek, 1995). Pennsylvanian tectonic episodes resulted in formation of variable uplifts and basins that define the current Permian Basin physiography (Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform, Delaware Basin, and surrounding platforms) while maximum subsidence occurred during the Wolfcampian (Shumaker, 1992; Ewing, 2019). Flooding of major uplifts and platforms after peak deformation resulted in establishment of carbonate factories rimming the basin. The timing coincided with peak icehouse conditions (Rygel et al., 2008; Tabor and Poulsen, 2008) resulting in highly variably platform geometries forming and evolving during the Wolfcampian (Wahlman and Tasker, 2013; Ruppel, 2019).\nSyndepositional tectonic movement resulted in adjustments in carbonate platform and slope profiles (Playton and Kerans, 2002). Tectonism and subsidence waned during the late Wolfcampian and into the Leonardian (Wahlman and Tasker, 2013; Ewing, 2019). Decreases in tectonic movement also coincided with decreasing amplitude of sea-level fluctuations and a broad climatic shift generating increasingly arid conditions (Wahlman and Tasker, 2013; Ruppel, 2019). Post-tectonic sag and sediment loading allowed subsidence to persist following maximum tectonic activity (Yang and Dorobek, 1995). After periods of significant tectonism, sediment accumulations in shelf environments were primarily a function of glacio-eustatic drivers (Kerans and Fitchen, 1995). The basin has experienced little deformation since the late Paleozoic with only minor tilting and movement around the basin margins (Ewing, 1993). More recent movement associated with Basin and Range tectonism resulted in uplift and exposure of Permian strata along the western and southern margins of the basin (Fig. 1) (Hill, 1996).\nThe detailed framework for the Permian stratigraphy of the Permian Basin originated in outcrops along the western margin of the basin (Fig. 1). Previous authors subdivided the Permian strata into 14 composite sequences with the lowermost 8 composite sequences represent the Wolfcampian and Leonardian strata discussed in this study (Kerans and Kempter, 2002). Previous work provided a detailed characterization and classification built on outcrop studies for these composite sequences (Wolfcampian: W1, W2, and W3, Leonardian: L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6) (Fig. 2\n, Fig. 3\na and b) (Kerans and Fitchen, 1995; Fitchen et al., 1995; Kerans and Kempter, 2002). These composite sequence definitions will be used for this study.\nWolfcampian to Leonardian stratigraphy exposed in the Sierra Diablo Mountains represent shallow water carbonates of the Diablo Platform and equivalent slope sections that correlate to the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring Formations in the deeper basin. In outcrop the Wolfcampian strata developed a ramp system (King, 1965; Fitchen et al., 1995). Syndepositional structural movement near the end of the Wolfcampian resulted in tilting and steepening of the ramp profile and tectonic shedding of material to the slope and basin (Playton and Kerans, 2002). The top of the Wolfcampian was further complicated by significant submarine erosion events and mass wasting along the outer ramp and slope resulting in as much as 270\u00a0m of submarine truncation (Fitchen et al., 1995; Fitchen, 1997).\nThe top of the Wolfcampian system on the platform is marked by a regional exposure surface and sequence boundary (King, 1965; Fitchen et al., 1995). Following the exposure Leonardian strata developed a series of composite sequences of varying geometry (L1-L6 of Fitchen et al., 1995; Fitchen, 1997). Biostratigraphic data show these units correlate to the basinal Wolfcamp A, 3rd Bone Spring, 2nd Bone Spring, and 1st Bone Spring Formations in the subsurface Delaware Basin (Wilde, 1990, 1995). The top of the L6 composite sequence (1st Bone Spring Limestone) in the western escarpment of the Guadalupe Mountains displays a significant exposure surface (Kerans and Fitchen, 1995). Sea-level rise following exposure resulted in a globally recognized transgression during upper Leonardian, backstepping of the carbonate platform, and starvation in the basin resulting in deposition of the Avalon Shale above the L6 composite sequence (Meissner, 1972; Silver and Todd, 1969, Kerans and Fitchen, 1995, Kerans and Kempter, 2002; Hurd et al., 2016).\nSignificant subaerial exposure surfaces at the top of the Wolfcampian and L6 composite sequence bracket the L1-L6 as a potential second order supersequence (Kerans, 2001). Individual sequences show varied rates of progradation and aggradation. However, the overall sequence shows a marked transition above the L3 composite sequence from aggradational platform growth below to rapid progradational growth patterns in composite sequences L4-L6 (Kerans, 2001).\nFew Delaware Basin subsurface studies define geometries of Wolfcampian carbonate platforms. However, an exposure and sequence boundary defining the top of the Wolfcampian on the Central Basin Platform coincide with exposure defined in the Sierra Diablo Mountains (Wahlman and Tasker, 2013). Subsurface studies on Leonardian strata in the northern Delaware Basin illustrate spatial variations in the preserved carbonate margin and slope geometries. Sarg (1989) shows the Leonardian system with increasing rates of progradation up section along the northwestern margin of the basin (Fig. 3c). Saller et al. (1989) indicates time equivalent Leonardian strata along the northern margin of the basin are strictly aggradational (Fig. 3d). These existing studies denote differences exist in growth patterns of this carbonate system. Saller et al. (1989) hypothesizes variations in aggradation and progradation may be related to higher rates of differential subsidence driving volumes of accommodation on the platform and affecting subsequent down-slope sediment movement.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThis study relies heavily of subsurface gamma-ray well-log correlation and mapping to constrain platform to basin correlations, identify temporal and spatial changes in slope and margin profiles, and infer possible controls on slope variations. This work incorporated approximately 8000 digital and raster well logs in the subsurface of the northern Delaware Basin (Fig. 4\na). Well tops on logs were manually picked and correlated through the study area. The proximity of vertical wells along the slopes allows for accurate and constrained platform to basin correlations and quality checking of mapping accuracy (Fig. 4b). Based on the constrained correlations, a total of approximately 100,000 well log tops marking key horizons were correlated through the dataset to constrain the spatial changes across the study area. As the mapped surfaces from well tops represented the main output from this study, log normalization was not necessary. While precise log values may be shifted in a minor number of wells, log motifs and character still allowed for manual correlation through these data.\nAll digital gamma-ray well logs within the project were imported into 3-D visualization software. The volume of data provides spatially referenced proportionally spaced views of the well logs. The density of data allows for quick visualization of large-scale depositional and structural geometries indicated by variations in log signatures without modeling or mapping. Intersection windows through the data oriented perpendicular to the slopes aid in illustrating differences in slope morphology. Unlike two-dimensional log cross-sections, the viewing technique allows for visual backfilling by wells in the plane of view than would not typically be incorporated in cross sections. The three-dimensional aspect and ease of manipulation aids in identifying accurate platform to basin correlations in stratigraphically complex areas. As the data is spatially referenced, it permits initial measurement of quantitative slope statistics (progradation\/aggradation ratios, platform to basin relief, slope width).\nStratigraphic horizons across the updip platform were mapped along the northern bounds of the study area toward equivalent margin and slope environments. Regional basinal stratigraphic units denoted in Fig. 2 were also mapped extensively through the study area. Correlative high gamma-ray siliciclastic mudstones and contacts between carbonate and siliciclastic sandstone units provided mappable surfaces with sequence stratigraphic significance. Basinal horizons extended toward the adjoining slopes with a high degree of confidence due to the presence of basinal shales and\/or sandstones providing constrained stratigraphic well-log markers. Approaching the slopes, lateral facies transitions and absence of siliciclastic sands due to bypass make the correlations more difficult. Both platform and basin well tops were correlated toward more distal and more proximal areas respectively until reaching complex and often steeply dipping adjoining carbonate margins and slopes. Using the identified correlations from areas with higher well densities, compressed well-log cross section, and 3-D well-log visualizations, correlations were made across these environments linking the platform and basin ties spatially around the northern margin of the Delaware Basin.\nThe well-log tops dataset allowed for generation of structure, isopach, and net maps for both the Permian stratigraphy as well as older underlying strata which may impart influence on overlying depositional trends. Structure grids indicate regional dip of approximately 1\u00b0 exists in the study area, indicating possible later basinal subsidence or tilting after deposition of the studied units. This is evident from the gentle continuous dipping eastward profile of flat platform top environments (Fig. 5\na). A simplified regional dip grid approximating the gentle eastward dip was generated and subtracted from all structure maps to remove the broad regional dip (Fig. 5b). The new output structure grids allow for more accurate quantitative assessment of slope morphology in terms of declivity, platform to basin relief, and slope widths (Fig. 5c). Corrections of the grids permitted observations of maximum slope gradients through the study area as well as measurement of slope widths where the dip profiles shift to less than 1\u00b0.\n\n3.1\nLimitations\nThis study covers a broad spatial and temporal range, but limitations exist. While well log spacing is extremely dense across the margins of the northern Delaware Basin, many wells target shallower Guadalupian strata and do penetrate the studied intervals. Therefore, coverage over Wolfcampian and Leonardian margins may be sparse in some areas. This is primarily an issue along the northeastern margin of the basin. Also, the available dataset may not be complete as we may not have access to all existing well logs.\nMapping techniques also have some pitfalls. Well logs have varying spatial densities, but generally have sub-kilometer spacing across the margin and slope profiles in the study. At this scale small-scale correlation errors and uncertainty in mapping are inherent in this system and likely embedded in the interpretation. However, these unresolvable errors are not impactful in reconstructing the large-scale geometries of the slopes. Also, well-log mapping and correlation algorithms must honor the well-top data. Given the likelihood of margin and slope variability, well log mapping may not capture the full margin and slope morphology. Therefore, well log mapping would give a \u201cminimum maximum\u201d slope gradient based on the data availability (Fig. 6\n). This becomes an even larger issue in areas of sparse well control (i.e. the northeastern portion of the study area). Extrapolation of trends from more data-rich areas may aid in inferring true morphology in locations with lower data density.\nCorrelation errors are possible across steep slope profiles. Slope settings contain a range of stratal architectures, various scales of channels, lobes, failure scarps and scars, and varying accumulations of resedimented materials making correlations difficult, or possibly erroneous (Fig. 6d). This was mitigated by incorporating multiple views and orientations of well log profiles and picking the most reasonable horizons based on the defined stratigraphic relationships and thickness trends.\nAlso, as this work incorporates seismic stratigraphic approaches, positions of the margins are selected based on rollover of mapped platform and slope profiles and not based on direct lithologic interpretations. The authors examined 12 cores in the study area that validated well-log lithology and slope and basinal interpretations, but all are distal of the updip carbonate margins. Therefore, true margin locations may deviate from the interpreted positions, altering measurements of progradation and aggradation of the systems. However, identification of major changes in depositional dip should still provide valuable approximations informing platform and slope evolution.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPlatform-to-basin interpretation\nWell density across portions of the Wolfcampian and Leonardian margins can be extremely high with common spacing of hundreds of meters. The high density allows for constrained sequence-scale correlation across margin and slope settings in most units. The Dagger Draw field on the Northwest Shelf provides the best locality to generate a well-constrained well-log derived platform-to-basin correlation (Figs. 4b and 7\n). Wells targeted the late Pennsylvanian buildups sitting directly underneath the margins of multiple Permian formations. Well logs in the field captured data over all zones of interest, and the advantageous location of the field allows for correlation from platform to slope with well spacing generally less than 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft). (Fig. 7). The correlation framework for this study incorporates the composite sequence definitions defined by Fitchen et al. (1995) in the Sierra Diablo Mountains. Log picks across the slope were defined by correlating easily identifiable basinal stratigraphic horizons (Fig. 2) updip and shelf successions downdip toward Dagger Draw Field. There is no precise biostratigraphic data through the section, so while surfaces may likely represent specific geologic time boundaries, the locations of some time equivalent surfaces may not be precise in more complex slope and platform settings. However, while there is uncertainty in precise ages, the locations of platform stratigraphic units and boundaries which correlate to basinal strata follow suit with existing studies (Meyer, 1966; Silver and Todd, 1969; Handford, 1981; Mazzullo and Reid, 1987; Saller et al., 1989; Ruppel and Ward, 2013). Exact boundaries with Pennsylvanian, Wolfcampian, and Leonardian boundaries may be slightly higher or lower than presented in this paper, but we prefer these correlations due to regionally correlative continuity.\nThe Pennsylvanian represents a period of significant tectonic activity in the Permian Basin. In some locations tectonic modification and erosion removes Pennsylvanian strata (King, 1965). However, in the current study location the Pennsylvanian system appears to be mostly unaltered, and the interpreted contact between Pennsylvanian and Permian strata can be easily correlated. This surface is denoted by a significant hot gamma ray marker that can be correlated through the basin. Deeper in the basin this surface correlates to the top of the siliciclastic mudstone-dominated \u201cWolfcamp D\u2033 unit and to the top of time time-equivalent carbonate-rich Cisco Formation in more proximal areas.\nWolfcampian strata overlie the Pennsylvanian reaching a thickness of approximately 500\u00a0m. On the platform the interpreted Wolfcampian-Leonardian contact is represented by a significant shift in log character from more sporadic serrated gamma ray profiles to clean homogenous log character representing the base of the L1 (Abo Fm.) (Meyer, 1966). Fig. 7 displays a faint series of flat lying well-log horizons transitioning to low angle prograding clinoform geometries. Moving southeast along the cross-section, these continuous sub-planar horizons transition abruptly into clean, blocky gamma ray signatures with an increased depositional dip. This zone likely represents the Wolfcampian slope. The abrupt end to the continuous sub-horizontal well log horizons in the upper Wolfcampian indicates possible truncation of outer platform deposits and juxtaposition with overlying Leonardian carbonate-rich debris shed from the slope and platform. This interpretation follows observations from outcrop where Wolfcampian outer ramp and slope settings exhibit significant submarine erosion and truncation of over 200\u00a0m of section (Fitchen et al., 1997). The interpreted Wolfcampian system shows variability in facies and stratigraphic architecture on short spatial scales, lack of significant defining internal well log signatures, and complexity with overlying Leonardian strata create difficulty in accurately mapping the Wolfcampian slopes across the northern margin of the basin. In the Midland Basin the Wolfcamp B surface approximates the top of the Wolfcampian (Sinclair et al., 2017). As the Wolfcamp A-Wolfcamp B contact is similar in both basins, it is likely the Wolfcamp B surface from this study also approximates the Wolfcampian-Leonardian boundary.\nOn the platform the L1 (Abo Fm.) and L2 (Lower Clearfork Fm.) sequences overlie Wolfcampian strata (Fig. 7). Both the L1 (approximately 300\u00a0m thick) and L2 (approximately 200\u00a0m thick) exhibit aggradational to slightly retrogradational carbonate margins. The contact between the L1 and overlying L2 sequences is clearly defined on the platform by a laterally continuous high gamma ray zone ranging from 40 to 60\u00a0m thick, but distinct differences between the two composite sequences are not apparent along the slope and into the basin. In the outcrop (Kerans, 2001; Janson et al., 2007), L1 slope debrites have defining rounded dolomudstone pebbles that allows for differentiation from overlying the L2 debrites. Subdivisions of these two units in more distal settings therefore is not permitted by well-log mapping and would likely require additional cores or biostratigraphic support to confirm this type of relationship. The combined L1 and L2 section correlates to the carbonate dominated unit below the 3rd Bone Spring sandstone, often referred to by the operational name \u201cWolfcamp A\u2033 in the basin (Sinclair et al., 2017; Wahlman, 2019; Kvale et al., 2020).\nThe L2 composite sequence is overlain by the Tubb Sandstone-3rd Bone Spring Sandstone. The siliciclastic-rich interval represents the base of the L3 composite sequence (Fitchen et al., 1995; Ruppel and Harrington, 2012; Ruppel and Ward, 2013). Above these sandstones the 3rd Bone Spring Limestone correlates to a 250\u00a0m thick platform succession which can be subdivided into two distinct well log sequences. The two intervals reach approximately 125\u00a0m (400\u00a0ft) each. The lower of the two sequences displays aggradational to slightly progradational platform and margin growth while the upper sequence shows a marked transition to rapid progradation. These two sequences likely correlate to the L3 and L4 composite sequences of Fitchen et al. (1995) and display the same shifts in margin trajectories as previous authors (Fitchen et al., 1995; Kerans, 2001). The basal portion of the L4 sequence correlates to a thin sandstone in the basin positioned in the middle of the 3rd Bone Spring Limestone referred to as the operational \u201cHarkey Sandstone\u201d. In some areas in the basin this subdivision is difficult to accurately identify in well logs, hindering subsurface mapping. The two composite sequences have been grouped for the remainder of the study due to limitations of the dataset.\nThe next succeeding platform unit (L5) is comparatively thin (70\u2013100\u00a0m) and correlates to the 2nd Bone Spring Formation. The horizon marking the correlation is difficult to precisely map and the slope setting has a significant amount of variability in terms of log well log response and continuity. The remaining platform sequence capped by the Glorieta sandstone (L6) correlates to the 1st Bone Spring. The platform succession ranges from 100\u00a0m thick in more proximal settings to 200\u00a0m thick to the west along the outer platform.\nThese correlations present a slight deviation from existing platform-to-basin relationships of Fitchen et al. (1995). The previous work correlated L3-3rd Bone Spring, L4- 2nd Bone Spring, and L5, L6- 1st Bone Spring. The changes in the current platform to basin correlations derived from well logs are validated by additional seismic interpretations. Two-dimensional sesimic lines across the northern margin of the Delaware Basin synthetically tied to well logs show the correlations of the top of the L2 composite sequence (Tubb Sandstone) and top of the L6 composite sequence (Glorietta sandstone) on the platform to the top of the \u201cWolfcamp A\u2033 and 1st Bone Spring Limestone in the basin, respectively (Fig. 8\n). The identified L1 and L2 composite sequences display aggradational to slightly retrogradational platform growth profiles, unlike the strongly progradational analogs in outcrop. Furthermore, correlations of Bone Spring intervals in the basin aid in validating the well log correlations from the Dagger Draw section. The 3rd Bone Spring interval in the basin correlates to a relatively thick succession on the platform with varied growth patterns (Fig. 8). The lower part of the platform equivalent section displays retrogradational growth and backstepping of the platform while the upper portion transitions to more progradational geometries. The thickness as well as shift in dominant growth patterns further illustrates the succession likely represents both the L3 and L4 composite sequences defined by Fitchen et al. (1995), with the L3 unit displaying retrogradational growth and the overlying L4 units shifting to progadational growth. The platform succession is then capped by a comparatively thin unit representing the L5 composite sequence correlating to the 2nd Bone Spring in the Basin, and a thicker unit representing the L6 composite sequence tying to the 1st Bone Spring.\nWhile the interpreted relationships to defined composite sequences are not well constrained biostratigraphically, the platform to basin correlation lines in this transect provide a reasonable update to the existing model based on stratigraphic trends. These new correlations along with varying visualization techniques helped constrain platform to basin correlations across the basin (Fig. 9\n).\n\n\n4.2\nVariability in margin and slope profile\n\n4.2.1\nStructural features\nDense well spacing and existing deep well penetrations most often targeting Morrowan or Atokan strata allowed for detailed mapping of multiple Pennsylvanian and Permian horizons. The Atokan system strata likely represent the last tectonically quiescent deposits in the Tobosa Basin before significant structural movement initiated during the middle Pennsylvanian-Desmoinian period (Yang and Dorobek, 1992, 1995; Ewing, 1993, 2019). Structural movement associated with Ancestral Rocky Mountains (ARM) and Ouachita-Marathon tectonism driving the formation of the Permian Basin would therefore manifest itself most completely in Atokan-aged and older strata.\nStructure maps generated on the top Atokan horizon show varying scales of interpreted faults (Fig. 10\na). The largest identified structure in the southwestern portion of the study area, which is referred to as the Huapache Monocline, exhibits a dominant northwest-southeast orientation (Fig. 10b). The fault is downdropped to the northeast, has over 1000\u00a0m of mapped vertical offset, and shows evidence of pulsed movement from the Pennsylvanian through the Leonardian (Meyer, 1966; Galley, 1968; Ross, 1986; Yang and Dorobek, 1995). It mirrors other large-scale identified features in outcrop and subsurface such as the Victorio and Babb flexures (orange dotted lines on Fig. 1). Certain stratigraphic intervals vary significantly in proximity to the fault (Fig. 10b). Much of the upper Pennsylvanian, Wolfcampian, and lower Leonardian (L1 and L2) strata thin or are absent overlying the monocline. The structure also appears to have influenced to a lesser degree middle Leonardian to lower Guadalupian strata as the L3 sequence thins and lower L5 strata (2nd Bone Spring Sandstone) are absent over the feature. Less significant but observable thickness changes associated with the monocline continue into the Guadalupian. These observations indicate the structure likely formed during late Pennsylvanian with the most rapid movement during the late Pennsylvanian and Wolfcampian. The structure remained as a positive feature and likely exhibited pulsed movement through much of the lower to middle Permian.\nOther sub-regional faults persist through the northern part of the basin maintaining the same northwest-southeast structural orientation as the Huapache Monocline (Fig. 10a). While not as large, these features extend up to 40\u201350\u00a0km in plan-view. The faults trending NW-SE may have experienced transpressional movement which would not be apparent from structure maps where vertical offset is minimal. It is possible that faults extend farther than interpretations illustrated from structural contour maps.\nAn additional set of interpreted faults with azimuths ranging from 0 to 25\u00b0 represent the next most dominant fault orientation. This subset is oriented between 45 and 60\u00b0 from the dominant northwest-southeast faults. Vertical movement along some faulted areas may reach up to 300\u00a0m while other faults of similar orientation only exhibit minor vertical movement and may be dominantly transpressional. A single large north-south basin-bounding fault zone exists in the eastern portion of the basin. The structure is likely associated with movement along the Central Basin Platform. The fault zone has an increasing degree of offset increasing from north to south, reaching maximum displacement of approximately 550\u00a0m. The structure generated significant sea floor topography shown to significantly impact sediment routing to the deeper basin in lower Leonardian strata (Kvale et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.2.2\nPre-Permian stratigraphy\nIn the Midland Basin the upper Pennsylvanian strata contain a large, isolated carbonate complex referred to as the Horseshoe Atoll (Myers et al., 1956; Vest, 1970; Waite, 1993; Alnazghah and Kerans, 2018). An age-equivalent carbonate-dominated buildup develops in the northern Delaware Basin as well (Wright, 2011). Thickness maps indicate the large carbonate buildup trends north 30\u00b0 east (Fig. 11\na). It extends from the Huapache monocline to the north across the western portion of the basin, obliquely cuts underneath the Permian margins, and continues across the Northwest Shelf (Fig. 11a). Well log mapping shows the carbonate-dominated buildup ranges between 10 and 20\u00a0km wide and up to 400\u00a0m in thickness. The carbonate-rich margin transitions laterally to the east into distal basinal shales (Wolfcamp D, Penn shale). Facies transition in proximal directions to the west into mixed carbonate and siliciclastic low-energy facies and isolated carbonate bodies and reefs (i.e.: Dagger Draw Field) (Cox et al., 1998; Mazzullo et al., 1998; Tinker et al., 2004).\nThe upper Pennsylvanian buildup represents a significant bathymetric feature and developed mapped relief of 150\u2013250\u00a0m moving downdip distally to the east. The synoptic relief also generated a relatively narrow slope 5\u201310\u00a0km wide with dips ranging from 2 to 8\u00b0 (Fig. 12\na). Along strike the late Pennsylvanian build up developed a variable topographic profile. The buildup houses various pinnacle-like features with up to 250\u00a0m of relief. The margin is also dissected by occasional large submarine canyons or reentrants 3\u201310\u00a0km wide with up to 150\u00a0m of relief. As such, the topography generated by these strata provide a variable framework that is likely to strongly control the shelf to basin sediment transfer and accumulation during subsequent Wolfcampian and Leonardian times.\n\n\n4.2.3\nWolfcampian\nOverall, the Wolfcampian system forms a comparatively low-gradient slope profile (Fig. 9). The interval displays thicker platform successions to the west reaching up to 700\u00a0m and thins to the east ranging between 400 and 600\u00a0m (Fig. 11b). Dips along the slopes are between 2 and 6\u00b0 (Fig. 12b). Gradients may locally reach up to 10\u00b0. Minor variation exists in the dip profile geometry spatially. Isopach maps show Wolfcampian strata thinning across the slopes reaching thicknesses of less than 50\u00a0m before thickening into the deeper basin (Fig. 11b). In the distal deposits upper Wolfcampian strata (Wolfcamp B) onlap and pinch out along the northern margin of the basin (Fig. 13\n).\n\n\n4.2.4\nL1-L2 composite sequences (abo and lower clearfork formations)\nTransects across the L1 and L2 margins primarily exhibit aggradational to slightly retrogradational geometries (Fig. 9). The combined L1 and L2 succession maintains relatively consistent platform thicknesses along the western portion of the study area (450\u2013600\u00a0m) and then thickens abruptly to the northeast (750\u00a0m) (Fig. 11c). Maximum slope gradients range between 15 and 25\u00b0 (Fig. 12c). Platform to basin relief is relatively consistent, ranging between 920 and 1100\u00a0m (Fig. 13, Table 1\n). Slope width remains relatively consistent between 10 and 13\u00a0km apart from locations in the southwestern-most portion of the studied slopes. Here slope width reaches up to 20\u00a0km. Basinal-equivalent Wolfcamp A strata are comparatively thin, typically between 100 and 200\u00a0m thick. The L1 and L2 intervals are capped by the Tubb Sandstone on the Northwest Shelf.\nL1 strata display progradation\/aggradation (P\/A) ratios from \u22128 to +7 relative the underlying Wolfcampian (Table 1). The terminal L1 margin and slope displays consistent gradients around the Northwest Shelf. Variations in P\/A ratio are more a function of variability in Wolfcampian margin profiles, resulting in apparent retrogradational and progradational patterns locally in the L1. L2 strata display more consistent retrogradational stacking profiles with P\/A ratios ranging between \u22121 and \u22126.\n\n\n4.2.5\nL3-L4 composite sequences (3rd Bone Spring Formation)\nThe combined L3-L4 sequences display significant differences in its margin and slope profile. The system is broadly progradational to the west and aggradational to the north (Saller et al., 1989) (Fig. 9). Progradational windows across the slope display successions reaching between 500 and 1000\u00a0m in thickness with slope gradients between 2 and 10\u00b0 while aggradational slopes are comparatively thinner, ranging from 100 to 300\u00a0m with maximum gradients ranging from 10 to 20\u00b0 (Figs. 11d and 12d). Along the southwestern portion of the study area the combined L3-L4 system progrades approximately 10\u00a0km from the underlying L1\/L2 margin with P\/A ratios approaching 40 (Fig. 13a and b). The rapid buildout occurs over wider underlying L2 lower slope settings and generates a low-gradient (2\u20134\u00b0) promontory protruding into the basin approximately 35\u00a0km. Moving north from the promontory, the system exhibits more regular 5-10-degree slopes (Fig. 12d) prograding 2\u20135\u00a0km into the basin with P\/A ratios between 7 and 14 (Fig. 13c and d). These progradation rates continues northward for approximately 40\u00a0km before the system becomes increasingly aggradational. Also, along this progradational western side of the basin, the platform deposits are slightly downdropped between 100 and 150\u00a0m METERS directly overlying the trend of the underlying L2 margin. A specific hinge point identified from mapping denotes the location where the shift from progradation to aggradation occurs (Fig. 14\n). Beyond this point the combined L3-L4 system and equivalent platform strata display dominantly aggradational growth with P\/A ratios less than 1 (Fig. 13f\u2013i).\nPlatform to basin relief in these units ranges from 800 to 900\u00a0m along the prograding portion of the system to the west and 950\u20131050\u00a0m along aggrading margins (Fig. 13, Table 1).\n\n\n4.2.6\nL5 composite sequence (2nd Bone Spring Formation)\nLike the underlying 3rd Bone Spring, the 2nd Bone Spring margin and slope also are broadly progradational to the west and aggradational to the east (Fig. 9). Thicker slope successions exist along the progradational portions of the system typically between 300 and 600\u00a0m with maximum slope gradients between 2 and 10\u00b0 while aggradational slope accumulations are thinner, often between 200 and 400\u00a0m with maximum gradients ranging from 10 to 15\u00b0 (Figs. 11e and 12e). Progradational sections of the margin and slope build 8\u201311\u00a0km into the basin from the underlying 3rd Bone Spring margin (Fig. 13a\u2013d). P\/A ratios are generally high along the western margin of the basin, ranging from 40 to 110 as platform-equivalent units are generally thin and the underlying 3rd Bone Spring provides relatively shallow gradients over which to prograde. Similar to the underlying L4 system, the platform deposits exhibit a slightly downdropped relationship in line with the underlying L2 margin along the progradational western side of the study area. The platform is downdropped between 100 and 200\u00a0m. The system transitions from progradational to weakly progradational-aggradational growth profiles at the same hinge point denoted in the underlying sequence. At this hinge point a significant buildout of the slope occurs forming a cone shaped promontory approximately 8\u00a0km wide and 15\u00a0km long tapering into the basin (Fig. 11e). Continuing to the east beyond the hinge point and promontory, progradation rates significantly decrease. P\/A ratios range from 3 to 10 (Fig. 13, Table 1).\nPlatform to basin relief is highest in sections overlying the 3rd Bone Spring promontory and along the northern margin of the basin, ranging from 850 to 950\u00a0m while the remaining progradational window exhibits platform to basin relief of 450\u2013750\u00a0m (Table 1). Slope widths are significantly affected by the underlying promontory in the 3rd Bone Spring Limestone and the cone-shaped slope promontory in the 2nd Bone Spring, with calculated widths of 23\u00a0km and 15\u00a0km respectively (Fig. 13). The progradational window between the two promontories has calculated slope widths ranging from 7 to 11\u00a0km. Weakly prograding slopes on the northern margin of the basin exhibit slope widths of 9\u201315\u00a0km.\n\n\n4.2.7\nL6 composite sequence (1st Bone Spring Formation)\nThe 1st Bone Spring Limestone also is broadly progradational to the west and aggradational to the north (Fig. 9). Again, slope thicknesses are greatest along the progradational window, ranging from 300 to 550\u00a0m while aggradational windows range from 100 to 300\u00a0m (Fig. 11f). Maximum slope gradients range from 2 to 15\u00b0 (Fig. 12f). The system is more aggradational over the 3rd Bone Spring and 2nd Bone Spring promontories with P\/A ratios of 1\u20132 (Fig. 13a, b, 13e). Along the western margin of the basin, the 1st Bone Spring within the window between the two underlying promontories exhibits subtle progradation with P\/A ratios from 6 to 15 and margins building between 1 and 4\u00a0km into the basin (Figs. 13c and 12d). To the east beyond the defined hinge point and 2nd Bone Spring promontory, a significant buildout occurs extending approximately 15\u201318\u00a0km and P\/A ratios approaching 80 (Fig. 13f). The buildout trends along the margin for approximately 18\u00a0km. It is possible the feature represents a localized buildout of the carbonate platform. However, the interpreted margin rollover occurs 200\u2013250\u00a0m below the equivalent updip platform (Fig. 13f). This feature forms a significant deviation in the slope profile. Beyond this buildout the L6 margin exhibits aggradational to minor progradational growth continuing east to the San Simon Channel (Fig. 13g\u2013i).\nPlatform to basin relief varies along the Northwest Shelf. Normally prograding margins exhibit relief of 510\u2013600\u00a0m (Fig. 13c and d, Table 1). The large promontory displays relief of 900+ m. Aggrading margins along the northern portion of the basin have relief ranging from 740 to 940\u00a0m. Slope widths vary with aggradational profiles on the northern section of basin ranging between 8 and 10\u00a0km while weakly prograding profiles are between 9 and 13\u00a0km. Slope widths overlying the significant 3rd Bone Spring promontory and to the east of progradational 1st Bone Spring buildout range from 15 to 20\u00a0km.\n\n\n4.2.8\nBasinal siliciclastic sandstones\nSignificant siliciclastic sandstone-siltstone deposits accumulate at the bases of the L3, L5, and L6 sequences (respectively named 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Bone Spring sandstones by Permian basin operators). The siliciclastic sediments blanket the underlying carbonate-dominated systems and may contain some mixed detrital carbonate material. Individual units reach a maximum thickness of approximately 160\u00a0m (Figs. 9 and 12). These basin-restricted sandstone packages onlap the underlying carbonate slopes. In all three sand units, accumulations generally extend farther updip on lower gradient slopes and pinch out more abruptly along steeper slopes (Figs. 9 and 12). As the sand bypasses steep slopes and accumulates at the toe of slope and basin, the presence of the siliciclastic units decreases platform-to-basin relief and toe-of-slope gradients for each subsequent carbonate deposit.\nLimestone. Blue dashed line\u00a0=\u00a0approximate upper Pennsylvanian thickness trend. Red dashed line\u00a0=\u00a0approximate L2 margin. Contour interval\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0m.\nOverall, the variations in growth patterns observed in Wolfcampian and Leonardian strata result in a complex stacked assemblage of spatially and temporally evolving margin and slope profiles around the northern portion of the basin (Fig. 14). Margins display prominent vertical stacking along the norther portion of the basin. The western portion of the study area displays a more complex growth history with varied rates of progradation and buildout into the basin.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nSea level\nSea level is a primary control on growth and accretionary patterns in carbonate settings as it influences carbonate productivity, platform size, sediment flux, volume of accommodation, and rates of off-bank sediment transport to the slope and deeper basin (James and Kendall, 1992; Handford and Loucks, 1993; Schlager, 1993, 2005).\nWolfcampian strata record the influence of icehouse high-frequency sea-level fluctuations resulting in complex stratal architecture (Fitchen et al., 1995; Kerans, 2001; Playton and Kerans, 2002). This is likely the primary reason for the inability to map variations in the Wolfcampian at finer levels of detail from well logs alone. The Wolfcampian strata are capped by a significant exposure surface and sequence boundary, likely in response to a broad sea level fall (King, 1965; Fitchen et al., 1995). In the subsurface study area, the L1-L2 sequences develop thicker platform successions compared to the outcrop, possibly driven by greater accommodation driven by subsidence. They also exhibit an overall aggradational to slightly retrogradational growth pattern. The L3 sequence exhibits aggradation in both locations, but it is difficult to delineate throughout much of the subsurface well log dataset. Subsurface L4-L6 sequences then present more progradational geometries. Overall, the shifts in growth patterns generally agree with the interpreted 2nd order sequence observed in it outcrop. However, variations in progradation-aggradation ratios in the L4-L6 composite sequences cannot be explained by eustatic change alone. The range in variability in the slope profiles within these units indicates other factors must be concurrently influencing slope deposition trends.\n\n\n5.2\nSubsidence\nSubsidence is one possible mechanism to generate accommodation in the basin. Holding sediment supply constant, higher rates of subsidence on the platform resulting in greater accommodation may drive aggradational to retrogradational growth of margins as sediment is stored on the platform top and not transported to the slopes (Schlager, 1992, 1993). Minimal subsidence may be more conducive to progradation of the margins as lower total platform top accommodation would be more easily filled, with excess sediment transported to the slopes. As such, varying rates of subsidence may result in differences in platform accommodation and subsequent differences in margin and slope growth profiles.\nPrevious authors noted progradational geometries to the west and aggradational geometries to the north and theorized the driver was variations in accommodation driven by differential subsidence (Saller et al., 1989). They note thickening of platform top successions moving from west to east likely in response to increasing subsidence rates moving toward the Central Basin Platform, hypothesizing that increases in accommodation on the platform decreased net transport of sediments to the slope and basin and drove aggradation of the platform. However, maps and cross sections show thickening of approximately 300\u00a0m in lower Leonardian (L1, and L2) strata, which have continuous aggradational profiles (Fig. 11c; Fig. 15\n). Middle and upper Leonardian strata (L3-L6) showing broad progradational geometries to the west and aggradational growth patterns to the north maintain relatively consistent thicknesses in platform-top successions (Fig. 15). Therefore, if subsidence drove variations in accommodation on the platform, it apparently would more dominantly impact the L1-L2 strata but may have not had a significant impact on L3-L6 platform accommodation. These observations indicate differential subsidence was likely was not a dominant driver of changes in progradation and aggradation rates along middle and upper (L3-L6) Leonardian slope and margin settings.\n\n\n5.3\nStructural movement\nStructural movement or faulting may influence margin and slope growth. Uplift may decrease platform accommodation while downthrown systems experience increases in accommodation. Changes in platform bathymetry generated by structural movement may influence currents and subsequent sediment transport. As such, structures cross-cutting platform and margin environments may influence sediment transport to the slope and deeper basin, resulting in localized variations in progradation rates in the system.\nFaults of varying scales interpreted from structure contour maps often cross-cut margin and slope settings of Wolfcampian and Leonardian unit. The Huapache Monocline represents the largest mapped structure in the study area and displays evidence of syndepositional movement. Data limits interpretation of platform and slope assessment on the upthrown side of the feature, so more detailed characterization of its influence is not possible currently. However, there is little direct evidence of significant sediment focusing on the northern downthrown side of the fault. The large promontory in the 3rd Bone Spring interval sits approximately 10 miles north of the structure, indicating no direct structural funneling of sediment downdip. It is possible the structure may influence platform sedimentation and routing farther updip beyond the extent of our data but is currently unrecognized.\nSmaller northwest-southeast and north-south trending faults likely imparted influence on slope morphology and down-slope movement. Sub-regional faults crosscut the northern margin of the basin. Mapping indicates the presence of a graben-like section of the northern margin of the basin approximately 25\u00a0km wide positioned between two significant fault zones, one cross-cutting the Lea-Eddy County boundary and the other trending northwest-southeast cross-cutting the mouth of the San Simon Channel (Fig. 10a). Total structural offset on the west and east reaches approximately 450\u00a0m and 600\u00a0m, respectively. Isopach maps of the combined L1-L2 composite sequences show variations in thickness of platform sediments in proximity to the faults (Fig. 11c). The combined L1-L2 isopach illustrates thickening of platform top sediments into the faulted area, possibly filling accommodation created by structural movement in the downdropped section (Fig. 11c). While other authors (Saller et al., 1989) hypothesize differential subsidence may drive increases in accommodation from west to east across the Northwest Shelf resulting in thickening of platform stratigraphy, these trends indicate pre- and syndepositional structural movement may have also been a driver of platform accommodation and subsequent increase in thickness during Wolfcampian and L1-L2 time.\n\n\n5.4\nControls on slope variations\n\n5.4.1\nUnderlying stratigraphy\nPre-Permian stratigraphy presents an underappreciated variable as a control on Wolfcampian and Leonardian margin and slope evolution. In some cases, the pre-Permian stratigraphy may generate antecedent topography and form a large-scale inflection (LSI of Hurd et al., 2016) which may alter slope and basin floor profiles, affect sediment routing, and drive variations in compaction profiles. The upper Pennsylvanian (Missourian and Virgillian (Kasimovian-Gzhelian)) Canyon and Cisco Formations form a significant LSI underlying the Wolfcampian and Leonardian systems in the Delaware Basin. The Pennsylvanian buildup forms directly over a northeast-southwest trending fault interpreted from the underlying Atokan strata. The structure possibly provided a depositional high and nucleation point for carbonate growth during periods of rapid subsidence during the late Pennsylvanian and set up a fulcrum promoting margin collapse until sufficient relief had been filled.\nThis carbonate buildup underlies Wolfcampian and Leonardian margins and slopes along the western side of the study area. The LSI alters available accommodation and platform to basin relief for these subsequent stratigraphic units (Hurd et al., 2016). Mapping indicates the margin was likely was a bathymetric high during Wolfcampian deposition and remained a positive feature into the Leonardian. Cross-sections and isopach maps show overlying Wolfcampian depositional gradients shallow toward the Pennsylvanian buildup and then steepen off the feature to the east (Fig. 16\n). Wolfcampian strata also thin approaching and overlying the buildup, and then thicken off the topographic feature to the southeast into the basin (Figs. 10 and 12). The trends in mapped gradient changes in overlying deposits occur in overlying Leonardian deposits with the degree of influence decreasing up section. The observations indicate the Pennsylvanian LSI likely impacted down slope transport of sediment gravity flows. The proximal portion of the upper Pennsylvanian system generated a relatively flat platform with little depositional relief and created an extended flat toe-of-slope to proximal basin floor environment in subsequent Permian units. The decrease in slope declivity proximal of the Pennsylvanian buildup likely promoted sediment accumulation in overlying units which drove progradation. It is also likely that the presence of the relatively flat upper Pennsylvanian platform was a primary driver of extended slope lengths along the western side of the basin. In contrast, the absence of a carbonate buildup along the northern margin of the basin may have promoted continued runout of gravity flows and inhibited significant slope accumulations that inhibit substantial progradation of the margin and slope.\nThe Pennsylvanian system also influenced platform to basin relief for subsequent margin and slope systems. The carbonate buildup transitions into basinal strata to the east thinning by approximately 200\u00a0m, generating additional bathymetric relief. Successions of Permian platforms developing west of the margin would experience a lower existing total platform to basin relief while it would be relatively higher distal of the feature to the east (Figs. 13 and 17\n). Measurements of platform to basin relief often reflect higher relief of 100\u00a0m meters on the northern portion of the basin where Permian strata built out over Pennsylvanian basinal shales (Table 1). The increase in platform to basin relief in Leonardian strata along the northern margin of the basin may have further inhibited progradation east of the Pennsylvanian buildup.\nVariations in strike profile also seemed to influence downslope sedimentation. Pinnacle-like features and canyons provided likely focusing mechanisms for down-dip sedimentation. Isopach thickness maps illustrate thinning of Wolfcampian strata over thick portions of the late Pennsylvanian buildup and thickening within and distal of the cross-cutting canyons (Fig. 11b). These topographic features likely focused the sediment through these points resulting in relatively thick accumulation of sediments downdip in the basinal area.\nA combination of the influences on slope width, slope gradients, platform to basin relief, and down-slope sedimentation indicate variations in upper Pennsylvanian stratigraphy likely represent another first order control driving the transition from progradation to aggradation in the L3-L6 composite sequences. Therefore, it is likely not a coincidence that the upper Pennsylvanian LSI underlies and intersects the Wolfcampian and Leonardian margin locations directly at the defined hinge point denoting the change from progradation to aggradation in the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Bone Spring formations.\nPrecursor margin and slope profiles play a large role in controlling growth patterns and geometries of subsequent overlying horizons. The Wolfcampian system likely provided a foundation and nucleus for subsequent Leonardian slope and margin growth. The overlying L1 and L2 sequences built upon the existing Wolfcampian system and exhibit the same overall plan-view terminal margin geometry (Fig. 17b and c). The Wolfcampian margin and slope likely represents a second LSI controlling the plan-view geometry of these units. The system aggrades and backsteps 2\u20134\u00a0km from the interpreted Wolfcampian margin. The overall growth pattern resulted in comparatively little basinal sedimentation as available sediment primarily filled accommodation on the platform. However, fault movement was still prevalent during growth of L1 and L2 systems resulting in slope failures and funneling of sediment to the deeper basin forming submarine fans (Kvale et al., 2020).\nThe upper 3rd Bone Spring Limestone presents the first broadly progradational unit of Permian age in the northern Delaware Basin. The large progradational promontory that builds out from the margin in the southwest portion of the study area significantly impacts the overlying 2nd Bone Spring and 1st Bone Spring margins and slopes. The promontory generates significant antecedent topography over which the L5 and L6 slope sections thin considerably. While the slope profiles are relatively thin overlying the feature, P\/A ratios are comparatively high as the systems build into the basin much faster than other locations in the basin. To the north of the promontory margin profiles prograde systematically from L3 to L6. The variations result in asymmetric progradation along the western margin of the basin.\nTo the north at the defined margin hinge point a smaller progradational promontory in the 2nd Bone Spring Limestone extends into the basin. Slope sediments may be focused into the basin at this location by unidentified faults, or possibly focused downslope by antecedent topography generated by the underlying Pennsylvanian system. The anomalous slope wedge in the 2nd Bone Spring Limestone provides a nucleation point for growth off its eastern flank of the large progradational buildout in the 1st Bone Spring Limestone.\n\n\n5.4.2\nInfluence of bottom currents\nWhile L3-L6 margins and slopes display broad progradation to the west and aggradation to the north, anomalous promontories protrude into the basin within the carbonate-dominated sections of the L4, L5, and L6 composite sequences. No direct drivers have been identified which may focus offbank transport of excess sediment at these locations to develop these promontories. Price et al. (2022) interprets the thick carbonate accumulations as elongate drift deposits accreted at specific locations along the western margin of the basin in response to counter-clockwise slope-parallel basinal currents. The three large drifts form in proximity to significant bathymetric irregularities which may locally alter current strength, resulting in deposition (Fig. 17d, e, 17f) (Price et al., 2022).\nThe three large drifts form during low-order highstand, driving progradation of the platform and transport of carbonate mud to the slope and basin. Counter-clockwise basinal currents likely swept muds from east to west and contributed significant volumes of fine carbonates to the promontories along the western margin of the basin (Price et al., 2022). The interpretation of drifts in the study area is significant for slope growth for multiple reasons. 1) The drifts locally influence progradation-aggradation ratios in coeval deposits, but also influence overlying deposits by altering slope accommodation and gradients. The lower relief overlying drift promontories tends to promote higher rates of progradation and buildout of the margin and slope by providing a substrate for progradation (Figs. 14 and 17). 2) Sweeping of sediment from east to west by basinal currents may inhibit accumulation of fine carbonate material at the toe-of-slope along the northern aggradational portion of the study area. Re-mobilization and transport of these sediments may inhibit buildout of the platform and promote continued aggradation as the deposits used to construct the slopes are continually winnowed (Fig. 17).\n\n\n5.4.3\nCompaction\nDifferential Compaction may exert variable influence on margin and slope growth and subsequent stratigraphic geometries (Hunt et al., 1995). Compaction increases with depth and results in porosity reduction and associated creation of accommodation (Doglioni and Goldhammer, 1988; Hunt et al., 1995; Goldhammer, 1997; Kominz et al., 2011). In carbonate systems competent margins are often juxtaposed to compactible slope and basinal sediments, resulting in the formation of compaction hinges overlying these lithologic transitions (Hunt et al., 1995; Hunt and Fitchen, 1999) and altering geometries of stratigraphic sequences.\nDifferential compaction likely occurs over many features, but the mapped late Pennsylvanian carbonate buildup and combined L1\/L2 margins exert the most significant influence on the growth patterns of the studied units (Fig. 17). The upper Pennsylvanian buildup presents a 200\u2013400\u00a0m thick carbonate succession that generated positive relief on the sea floor. The succession grades rapidly into basinal shales downdip (Fig. 16b). The differences in lithology likely created a compactional hinge over the thick carbonate section. Rates of compaction-induced subsidence were likely high in adjacent basinal shales juxtaposed to the margin. A change in dip profile exists in overlying L2\/Wolfcamp A basinal strata (Figs. 12c and 17c). This is likely a combination of draping of sediments overlying a topographic high combined with compaction-enhanced tilting. Compaction across the upper Pennsylvanian buildups likely increased platform to basin relief east of the feature along the northern side of the basin. Increase in relief and subsequent accommodation east of the defined hinge line could further inhibit progradation of subsequent margins east of the feature.\nSignificant compaction also occurred over the L1-L2 aggradational margin. The consistent L2 margin rimming the northern portion of the basin forms a competent compaction hinge resulting from the compactional flexure in overlying strata. L3 through L6 progradational sequences built out over the existing competent margin and over compactible slope and basinal strata. A change in dip exists over all studied overlying Leonardian units due to an increase in accommodation immediately basinward of the L2 margin likely driven by differential compaction. Each subsequent interval (L3-L4, L5, L6) exhibits an increasing degree of flexure over the underlying margin, with over 100\u00a0m of mapped relief possibly resulting from compaction-induced subsidence associated with the L2 margin (Fig. 13d, e, 13f). The effects of compaction may be exacerbated in the L6 sequence as the northernmost promontory extends beyond both the L2 margin and Upper Pennsylvanian carbonate buildup (Fig. 12f). The section displays over 150\u00a0m of relief from the more proximal platform top. The effects of compaction are compounded across these two compaction hinges. It is also possible the effects of compaction may be overstated by the maps, particularly in the L6 interval. As the thick accumulation distal of the compaction hinge has been interpreted as a drift deposit by Price et al. (2022), the change in slope distal of the compaction hinge may represent the edge of the accumulation instead of the margin, and the drift may represent shallower water slope deposits. Additional core analysis would be required to validate the correct interpretation.\n\n\n\n5.5\nSlope summary\nThe study highlights the compounding effects of interpreted controls on slope geometry in early Permian strata in the Delaware Basin. The studied Wolfcampian and Leonardian strata appear to be influenced by multiple factors providing a unique setting driving a high degree of variation in margin and profiles (Fig. 17). Highly variable Pennsylvanian carbonate buildups likely develop in response to peak icehouse conditions and initiation of rapid subsidence during Permian Basin formation, creating an irregular seafloor profile influencing later deposition and subsequent slope geometry. Pre- and syndepositional tectonic movement and faulting resulted in structural modification of the platforms rimming the basin, generated irregularity from initiating slope failures, and influenced possible sediment routing to the slopes. The studied units record the transition from peak icehouse to transitional periods with high amplitude sea level fluctuations which may additionally add high levels of heterogeneity. Also, the possibility of bottom currents mobilizing and redepositing sediment along specific portions of the slopes likely influence the magnitude of progradation as well as runout of subsequent gravity flows by altering slope gradients and platform to basin relief.\n\n\n5.6\nSubmarine fan accumulations\nVariations in geometries in margin and slope morphology may play a significant role altering sediment accumulations deeper in the basin. Recent work by Kvale and others (2020) identified a large mixed carbonate-siliciclastic submarine fan (>15\u00a0km wide) in the eastern portion of this study area. While other smaller (<5\u00a0km wide) carbonate submarine fans or lobes have been previously identified in the basin (Janson et al., 2007; Clayton and Kerans, 2012), this was the first large calciclastic-siliciclastic submarine fan documented in the Permian Basin. The fan displays significant structural influence as it appears to be focused and sourced along the downthrown side of a large fault extending into the basin. The fan consists of a coarser carbonate-dominated fan axis and finer grained siliciclastic fan fringe deposits. The variation and distribution of lithofacies allowed for identification of lateral facies transitions as well as well log mapping of the fan complex (Kvale et al., 2020).\nNo other larger-scale calciclastic-siliciclastic submarine fans have yet been documented in the Permian Basin. The extensive mapping from this study highlighted the presence of multiple interpreted large-scale submarine fans in both Wolfcampian and Leonardian strata (Fig. 18\n). The features display lower gamma ray fan axes transitioning off-axis to higher gamma ray intervals. Based on previous work by Kvale et al. (2020), this transition likely indicates a shift from coarser carbonate-dominated fan axes to finer grained siliciclastic material off-axis. These fans generally initiate on lower gradient slopes and display focusing from bathymetry created by underlying stratigraphy (Fig. 18a). In some instances, variations in margin and slope geometry within underlying units form reentrants and antecedent topography that may focus sediment within specific windows, such as in the interpreted L5 sequence (2nd Bone Spring Limestone) (Fig. 18b).\nProcesses within these distributive features likely provide an underappreciated control on reservoir quality of unconventional play strata in the Permian Basin. Continued runout of gravity flows within fan environments likely can concentrate finer grained sediments and organic matter on the distal fringes of these fan complex. Therefore, organic richness and source rock potential in the deeper basin may be significantly influenced by location relative to interpreted sub-environments within a given fan. In scenarios with less data, first approximations of fan locations could be interpreted based on detailed characterization of the margins and slopes, identifying possible windows and locations conducive to offbank sediment transport driving fan growth. These observations may provide additional exploration strategies for other linked platform, slope, and basinal reservoirs that may be sourced from organic-rich mixed carbonate-siliciclastic fan fringe environments.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nDetailed well-log mapping in the northern Delaware Basin highlights the complex spatial and temporal changes in the early Permian slope intervals. Wolfcampian and Leonardian margin and slope profiles are dynamic and present a wide variety of depositional profiles within any one geologic unit. Margin and slope geometries are influenced at varying scales by the combination of eustatic sea level change altering platform accommodation, tectonic movement generating sea floor bathymetry affecting sediment routing to the slope and basin, position of large-scale inflections of slope generated by Pennsylvanian carbonate buildups underlying the Permian system, possible influence of contour currents, location precursor margin and slope morphology, and differential compaction.\nThe western side of the basin exhibits lower platform to basin relief compared to the northern side of the basin which may promote progradation. This is likely driven by differences in slope height created by a large-scale inflection along an older late Pennsylvanian carbonate buildup, which may promote progradational growth along the lower relief slopes. Large promontories along the western progradational portion of the slopes in the L4, L5, and L6 composite sequences generate significant bathymetry and result in spatial changes in slope widths and gradients. The promontories form near bathymetric perturbances such as the reactivated Huapache Monocline, the turning point of the margin to the southwest in the northwestern portion of the study area and juxtaposed to underlying Pennsylvanian carbonate buildups. These features may locally influence basinal currents resulting in drift accumulations which may comprise the promontories.\nThe variations in slope gradient and slope geometry may also promote runout of gravity flows to the deeper basin, influencing thickness and composition of basinal sediment accumulations. Asymmetric growth of margin and slope profiles may also form reentrants or antecedent topography which may possibly point source detrital carbonate material, resulting in accumulation of sizeable carbonate submarine fans.\nAs this work heavily leverages stratal geometries identified from well-log mapping, continued work is necessary to linking this regional study with more detailed characterization of associated rock data from subsurface cores and outcrop as well as incorporation of 2D and 3D seismic data to validate results from this study, more precisely define margin locations, highlight changes in lithologic composition, and identify more detailed stratal relationships limited by well density or well log resolution.\n\n","71":"","72":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSedimentary basins host significant geological resources including fossil fuels and potential CO2 storage sites. For structural traps associated with these, faults are often important features for seal integrity. For CO2 storage sites in particular, identifying detection and resolution thresholds for gas seeps along faults is of vital importance for site integrity and monitoring.\nFault zones comprise heterogeneous, tabular bodies of rocks that have altered properties compared to the host-rock, from either strain or diagenetic effects. Outcrop studies document faults as narrow, high-strain fault cores with one or several slip surfaces that accumulate most of the throw. The fault core is surrounded by a halo of discrete structures (e.g., fractures and deformation bands) in low-strain damage zones (Fig. 1\n; Wibberley et al., 2008; Braathen et al., 2009; Childs et al., 2009; Fossen, 2010; Torabi et al., 2020).\nDetection and resolution limits in seismic imaging of faults rarely allow identification of this subdivision, although amplitude changes associated with fault zones have been attributed to strained rock volumes (Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Alaei and Torabi, 2017). The limitations in detectability, illumination and resolution cause uncertainties and pitfalls regarding fault geometries (Bond, 2015; Schaaf and Bond, 2019; Michie et al., 2021; Faleide et al., 2021). Such uncertainties are well illustrated by synthetic seismic sections based on simple geological models. To further our understanding of subsurface faults we have to establish and test more realistic models of fault architecture and properties, including deformation zones.\nThe fundamental question addressed by this study is: to what degree detailed fault architectures and gas seeps can be detected and resolved in seismic data? As a baseline case, a high-resolution P-Cable dataset (Planke et al., 2009, 2010) from the Hoop area in the SW Barents Sea is used, which hosts a well-imaged fault forming the basis for a fault model guided by the findings of Faleide et al. (2021). It is worth noting that the present study has a generic focus, and is not a case study of the geological evolution of the Hoop area. The baseline model for this study, M1, consists of a fault (F2 from Faleide et al., 2021) that lacks a damage zone. The baseline fault model is further developed into five alternative models (M2-M6) by incorporating features known from outcrops (e.g., Schueller et al., 2013; Ogata et al., 2014). These include a more realistic fault architecture characterized by a damage zone with deformation bands and fractures dependent on varying clastic lithologies as well as the presence of a fracture corridor (Fig. 1).\nAs an important step towards seismic monitoring of CO2 storage, we introduce gas\/CO2 in potential reservoirs and along the fault and fracture corridor to see the effects in the seismic imaging. Each model forms the basis for 2D point-spread function (PSF)-based seismic convolution modelling (Lecomte et al., 2015) to systematically explore how seismic reflection data, both high-resolution and conventional, image such structures. The seismic modelling tests detection and resolution thresholds for the observation of various fault architectures and gas seepage along these realistically designed faults and allows for the identification of subtle signature-changes attached to fault architecture and gas saturation.\nFurthering our understanding of the ability to image the complexity of fault zones, distribution and composition of the damage zone and identification of potential fluid pathways within them is important for site verification. It is also useful for improving the general understanding of limitations and pitfalls in fault interpretation, thereby potentially contributing to economic de-risking and more sustainable usage of resources.\n\n\n2\nData and geological setting\nThe seismic data guiding the fault models are from the eastern flank of the Hoop Fault Complex, offshore in the Barents Sea, more specifically around the Gemini North well (Fig. 2\n). In this area, Faleide et al. (2021) performed a detailed study of two normal faults (F1 and F2 in Fig. 2c), addressing objective and subjective uncertainties associated with seismic interpretation of faults. In this study, the focus is restricted to fault F2 (Fig. 2c\u2013e).\nThe baseline model in this study (i.e., a fault without a damage zone, M1), builds on interpretations of fault F2 on a WNW-ESE seismic section in the HR14_3D_HFCE1 high-resolution P-Cable seismic volume (Figs. 2e and 3\n) by a test panel with different geological backgrounds, as presented and analysed in Faleide et al. (2021). The high-resolution seismic cube overlap with a conventional seismic cube (Fig. 2b). The P-Cable 3D from 2014 (TGS, WGP and VBPR) has a bin size of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m, whereas the conventional 3D survey from 2012 (TGS) offers a bin size of 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018.75\u00a0m. Both seismic datasets have zero-phase polarity, and peaks corresponding to an increase in acoustic impedance are represented as red. The dominant frequency is 150\u00a0Hz (P-Cable) and 40\u00a0Hz (conventional), corresponding to a vertical seismic resolution of about 5\u00a0m and 20\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 2d and e).\nStratigraphy and related elastic properties are constrained from well 7325\/4\u20131 (Gemini North; Fig. 4\n). The gamma ray (GR), photoelectric factor (PEF) and combined density\/neutron porosity logs are used for lithology prediction (Figs. 3b and 4). 1D synthetic seismic traces are created based on the sonic and density logs. For the intervals where density log values are missing, a pseudo-density log is estimated based on standard velocity-density relationships. The time\/depth relations measured in the well provide seismic velocity information (P-wave velocity, Vp) used for depth conversion (Figs. 3 and 4).\nThe targeted succession of this study consists of the Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group and the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Adventdalen Group (Fig. 4; Worsley, 2008). The Kapp Toscana Group, comprising the Snadd, Fruholmen, Tub\u00e5en, Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations, is dominated by variable mudstones, siltstones and sandstones deposited in pro-deltaic, shallow marine, coastal and fluvial environments (Klausen et al., 2018). The St\u00f8 Formation comprises the most mature and well-sorted sandstones of the succession with reservoir-grade deposits occurring in the fine to medium grained cross-bedded sandstones from upper shore-face deposits (Mendoza et al., 2019) and porosity estimates from logs are 20\u201324% (Farazani, 2017). Shales dominate the overlying Adventdalen Group of Fuglen\/Hekkingen to Kolmule formations, which were deposited during a marine highstand cutting off the supply of coarse clastics (Worsley, 2008). Several intervals consist of organic-rich paper shales deposited in deep marine anoxic conditions with high organic productivity. The uppermost deposits comprise the Quaternary above the Upper Regional Unconformity (URU; Fig. 4) that consists of thick prograding wedges of sheet-like clay-silt and sandstone units, transitioning into glaciomarine deposits in the upper parts (Ottesen et al., 2009).\n\n\n3\nMethods and workflows\n\n3.1\nModel building - input to fault and fracture corridor models\nThe baseline model (Fig. 3) is adopted from Faleide et al. (2021) based on fault interpretation and corresponding traced horizons in high-resolution seismic data belonging to one of their scenarios (2.4) in a study addressing seismic interpretation uncertainties of subsurface faults. In this model the fault is interpreted as a single line in the 2D section. The traced horizons and fault segments are depth-converted according to the two-way travel time (TWT) and average velocity information from the Gemini North well. The depth-converted horizons and faults are exported as an image and imported to a graphics program (in an artboard with a reasonable pixel size relative to the size of the model; preferable 1 px\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0m, corresponding to 1\u00a0m sampling) where they are converted to editable traces. Each layer, 32 in total, is assigned a colour indicative of lithology. Since faults are often represented in seismic data by the displacement of layers\/reflections, and not the fault plane itself, fault picks are removed. The resultant model is exported as a PNG file, ready for input to the seismic modelling software.\nThe stratigraphy is divided into four lithologies; sandstone, shaley sandstone, sandy shale and shale. The boundary between the lithologies is based on the GR log response from the Gemini North well, which covers the whole interval. A sand and shale line are set based on the average values for the layers corresponding to well-known sandstone (St\u00f8 Formation) and shale (Fuglen and Hekkingen formations) units (Fig. 4). The sandstone layers in the lower St\u00f8 Formation are the reference for clean sand with GR\u00a0=\u00a070 API and PEF\u00a0=\u00a02.25\u00a0b\/electron. The PEF value supports the definition of sand (Mondol, 2015). The sandstone line is set to 75 API, and therefore all layers with GR\u00a0<\u00a075 is defined as sandstone in this study. The shaley Fuglen Formation is the reference for clean shale, with a high GR response around 160\u2013165 API, along with the fine-grained Hekkingen Formation with values of 130\u2013150 API. Based on these formations the shale line is set to 130 API. The high PEF value of 3.46\u00a0b\/electron supports the shale definition (Mondol, 2015). Rock units falling between the sand and shale lines of the GR log are divided into two mixed lithologies, i.e., shaley sandstone with a GR response of 75\u2013102 API and sandy shale with a GR response of 102\u2013130 API. The combined Density\/Neutron log supports the lithology interpretation (Fig. 4).\nThe baseline model (M1) is further developed by incorporating structural features known from detailed studies of outcrops in the field. Such studies have established robust statistical relationships between fault throw, fault core thickness and damage zone width and intensity (e.g., Bastesen et al., 2013; Schueller et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2016; Torabi et al., 2020), allowing conditioning of fault zone architecture in modelling (Braathen et al., 2009). Empirical relationships between fault throws and the width of the damage zone, established by Schueller et al. (2013), have been utilized to make a damage zone for the F2 fault (Fig. 5\n). Their statistical damage zone model is established for highly porous sandstones, but is herein applied to all units irrespective of lithology for simplification. This approach adheres to the conclusion of Torabi et al. (2020) on fault scaling, advocating that damage zones offer similar trends irrespective of lithology and corresponding style of deformation. Further, the width of the damage zone is considered similar for the hanging wall and footwall to the fault.\nDamage zones can be further subdivided into inner and outer zones (Fig. 5b and c), from differences in spatial frequency of structures (e.g., Berg and Skar, 2005). As fault core widths are on the cm-dm scale, they are herein, for practical purposes considered parts of the inner damage zone. The width of the fault damage zone, with subdivision into inner and outer, is determined based on fault throw, which has a maximum of about 60\u00a0m but varies along the F2 fault (Fig. 5b). The corresponding maximum width of the damage zone is about 50\u00a0m. Throw is calculated for each stratigraphic unit (Fig. 5b), guiding damage zone width and subdivisions of structural element intensity as described in Schueller et al. (2013):\n\n(1)\n\n\nW\n1\na\nv\n=\n3.67\n\nT\n0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nW\n5\na\nv\n=\n2.32\n\nT\n0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nW\n10\na\nv\n=\n1.41\n\nT\n0.44\n\n\n\n\nwhere T\u00a0=\u00a0throw in m and Wx\u00a0=\u00a0width in m from the fault core. The x value of 1, 5 or 10 represents the deformation band density reached at the distance Wx from the fault core, either in the footwall or in the hanging wall (Schueller et al., 2013). Inner damage zones are represented by the W10 zone\u00a0=\u00a0W10av (Eq. (3)), whereas outer damage zones are represented by the W1 zone\u00a0=\u00a0W1av (Eq. (1)) \u2013 W10av (Eq. (3)). As the W5 zone (W5av (Eq. (2))) appears narrow in field observations (e.g., the Bartlet Wash Fault; Fig. 1b), this zone has been omitted.\nFracture corridors, as outlined in Ogata et al. (2014) and Gabrielsen and Braathen (2014), appear as damage zones along faults and around fault-tips, thereby corresponding with fault zone strain outlined above. In two models (M5 and M6), one isolated fracture corridor caused by fold-crest dilation or fault-tip process zone, without shear offset of markers (Ogata et al., 2014), is included (Fig. 5). Joints are implemented structures that are distributed as 20 joints (4 joints\/meter) at the maximum width of 5\u00a0m, trailing off towards the tips, as shown in Fig. 5d and e.\n\n\n3.2\nConditioning elastic properties of lithologies and rock damage\nWith implementation of fault damage, elastic parameters (Vp, Vs, density) vary in layers within the damage zone close to the fault (Fig. 5; Table 1\n). Fault strain in clean sandstone is conditioned as deformation bands, whereas shale units host fractures. For mixed, interlayered lithologies, both deformation bands and fractures are applied. Rock properties are influenced by rock strain (dilation or compaction; e.g., Braathen et al., 2020), partly guided by host-rock porosity. High-porosity sandy layers (>12\u201315% porosity) deform by deformation bands, envisioned as cataclastic shear-compaction bands herein (e.g., Fossen et al., 2007, 2018). Damage zone compaction causes a decrease in porosity and a corresponding increase in velocity and density. For lower-porosity units (<15%), such as shales, the damage zone is dominated by fractures. Contrary to deformation bands, fractures dilate rocks, thereby increasing porosity with corresponding decreases in velocity and density (e.g., Sigernes, 2004; Botter, 2016). Furthermore, fluids in fractures impact elastic properties. For instance, when CO2 in gas phase replaces water in the fractures, there will be an additional decrease in Vp (Agofack et al., 2018). In cases of shaley sandstone, deformation is distributed as 2\/3 deformation bands and 1\/3 fractures, compared to sandy shale with 1\/3 deformation bands and 2\/3 fractures.\nBased on the Gemini North well (Fig. 4), average parameter values for each of the 32 layers are calculated (Table A1 in Appendix A). The Vp is determined based on the check-shot time-depth information (Fig. 4). For layers that are not covered by the Vs and density log data, the parameters are calculated based on the interval Vp and Vp\/Vs ratio for the same typical lithology in the model, and the Gardner's rule (Gardner et al., 1974) relating velocity (Vp; m\/s) and density (\n\n\u03c1\n\n; g\/cm3), respectively:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c1\n=\n0.31\n\u2217\n\nV\np\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the damage zones, the elastic parameters are adjusted dependant on deformation by fractures or deformation bands, and the distribution of damage (inner and outer damage zone; Table 1 and Table A1 in Appendix A). The effects of deformation are estimated based on values (percentage interval) for maximum decrease and increase of velocity for siliciclastic rocks, based on Botter (2016), Botter et al. (2014, 2016) and references therein. In the models, deformation bands in sandstones cause a 30% increase in Vp and Vs for the inner damage zone and 15% for the outer damage zone. In lower-porosity units with fractures, the predicted decrease in seismic velocity is 40% for Vp and 30% for Vs in the inner damage zone, while Vp and Vs decrease in the outer damage zone by 20% and 15%, respectively. In mixed lithologies (shaley sandstone and sandy shale), the effects between the two end-member type lithologies are scaled. In shaley sandstone, there is a 10% increase for Vp and Vs for the inner damage zone, and a 5% increase for the outer damage zone. For sandy shale, there is a 20% decrease for Vp and a 10% decrease for Vs in the inner damage zone, while Vp and Vs decrease in the outer damage zone by 10% and 5%, respectively. New densities are calculated with Gardner's rule (Eq. (4)) using the new estimated Vp. The values for Vp, Vs and density are presented in Table A1 in Appendix A.\nIf gaseous CO2 (or other gases) migrates along a shallow fault, as expected above c. 800 m depth, with gas replacing water in the fractures, Vp will decrease. An additional \u223c13% reduction of Vp and \u223c1% reduction of Vs were thus included in the models based on Agofack et al. (2018). These values (Table 1) were used to adjust the elastic parameters both in the inner and outer damage zones for all layers assumed to have fractures filled with gaseous CO2.\nThe fracture corridor is divided into 6 intervals (Fig. 5d,e), and the reduction of Vp and Vs is in the range of 40%\u20132% and 30%\u20132%, respectively, taken the maximum reduction from the inner damage zone for the shale and interpolating to zero-reduction (outside the fracture corridor; Table 2\n). Average Vp and Vs from the shale units are used as a basis for the estimation of reduced Vp, Vs and density within the fracture corridor (Table 2).\n\n\n3.3\nSeismic modelling\nThe main steps of the workflow for the 2D PSF-based seismic convolution modelling (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016) are presented in Fig. 6\n and are similar to Faleide et al. (2021). 2D geological models were first created from depth-converted horizons and fault interpretations (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The models are 1500\u00a0m wide and 450\u00a0m high, and the sampling interval is 1\u00a0m horizontally and 0.2\u00a0m vertically. Each layer of the model was then assigned constant elastic parameters (i.e., Vp, Vs and density; Table A1 in Appendix 1) to further calculate the reflectivity using the Zoeppritz equations (Shuey, 1985, Fig. 6d). Given the lack of detailed survey information and a velocity model for the considered data, a simplified and idealized version of the PSF-based convolution modelling is used by directly designing PSFs from a few key parameters (Lecomte et al., 2016). A generic illumination pattern is thus selected, defined by a regular illumination of all reflector dips until a selected maximum (e.g., 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 dip range), in addition to an average velocity, an incident angle, and wavelet extracted from the seismic data. Together these are used to generate a so-called PSDM filter (Fig. 6). The PSF is obtained from a Fourier Transform (FT) of that PSDM filter (Fig. 6e) and convolved with the reflectivity model to obtain a synthetic (PSDM-like) seismic image (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). The synthetic seismic image (Fig. 6f) corresponding to the input geological model can then be analysed as a function of various wavelets and the other parameters mentioned above.\nIn addition, noise is added to the synthetic seismic sections to make it more realistic. The colored-noise model is generated by convolution of a random white reflectivity model with the same PSF used for the synthetic seismic described earlier, thus reproducing the same (PSDM-like) filtering effect that the geological models receive in the seismic modelling. The reflectivity range of the noise model was scaled according to the reflectivity range of the input geological model to test different signal-to-noise ratios. All synthetic seismic sections, including the noise components, were also amplitude-calibrated so that an input \u2013 single \u2013 horizontal reflector of strength +1 yields a flat reflection with a peak of amplitude +1. With actual data, such amplitude calibration is performed via wavelet estimation for well ties, this to compensate for non-preserved amplitudes due to seismic acquisition, processing and imaging. With the modelling method used here, the seismic amplitudes are constrained from the PSF, which stems itself both from geophysical parameters (e.g., wavelet, incident angle, illumination pattern, etc.; Lecomte, 2008) and from FFT parameters (size and sampling of the imaged area). The single, unit and horizontal reflector test thus allows to compensate for both effects by a simple normalization. This amplitude calibration allows therefore direct comparisons between input reflectivity and seismic amplitudes (using the same absolute scales for display), the latter resulting, however, from various interferences (constructive and destructive) of the seismic signals after (PSDM) migration, including the possible lack of illumination of steep reflectors.\nA powerful tool for comparison and detection of differences in synthetic seismic sections is to make difference plots. Such difference plots help to emphasize changes between gas-filled vs water-filled damage zones and fracture corridors. Another powerful tool is to compare reflectivity and corresponding synthetic wiggle traces for each model, to see if these match or miss-match, and superimpose seismic wiggle traces for two models together to see the difference in response.\nAs shown in Table 3\n, geophysical parameters such as wavelet, incident angle and illumination pattern are varied to, e.g., represent either the conventional or the high-resolution seismic volumes. The wavelets are extracted from the two seismic data types. For the target area around fault F2 (750\u2013850 TWT interval), the dominant frequencies are 40\u201345\u00a0Hz and 90\u00a0Hz, respectively (power spectrum in Faleide et al., 2021). The wavelet corresponding to the high-resolution seismic data is mainly used to generate the synthetic seismic images of all geological models. The incident angle for the long-offset conventional seismic data is set to 20\u00b0, and for short-offset high-resolution data 0\u00b0. The standard geophysical parameters (Table 3) for all models in this study comprise: a 45\u00b0 illumination angle, implying that reflectors dipping between 0 and 45\u00b0 will be illuminated; 0\u00b0 incident angle representing the short-offset high-resolution seismic data, and the wavelet with frequency of 90\u00a0Hz. Two of the models, M2 and M5, are tested with both wavelets and different incident angles (0\u00b0 and 20\u00b0) to illustrate the resolution differences between high-resolution and conventional data. Model M2 is also generated\/tested with different illumination angles: 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 (as the standard parameter for all models) and 90\u00b0 (perfect illumination).\n\n\n\n4\nResults of seismic modelling\nIn total, six geological models (M1-M6) are tested with seismic modelling targeting fault F2 (Figs. 2c, 3a and 7\n). The models are 1500\u00a0m wide, 450\u00a0m high and consist of 32 layers (Figs. 3 and 5). The main fault and horizon\/layer interpretations are similar in all scenarios, and the widths of the inner and outer damage zone are identical for models M2-M6. F2 bifurcates into two segments (F2a, F2b; Figs. 3a and 5a) at around 240\u00a0m depth; below this, the fault has a dip of 45\u00b0. The two segments above, F2a and F2b, have dips of 25\u201335\u00b0 and 40\u201345\u00b0, respectively. F2a terminates within layer 8 whereas F2b extends to the top of the model. Model M1 (the baseline model; based on Faleide et al., 2021) is F2 without a damage zone (Figs. 3b and 7a); model M2 is F2 with damage zone (Fig. 7b); model M3 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 gas in the footwall and hanging wall (Fig. 7c); model M4 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 gas in the footwall (Fig. 7d); model M5 is F2 with damage zone and an isolated fracture corridor away from F2 (Figs. 5 and 7e); and model M6 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 leaking from a sandy reservoir up into the F2a footwall and in the fracture corridor (Fig. 7f). The elastic parameters vary in the layers within the damage zone close to the fault, and within the fracture corridor for the last two models (Tables 1\u20132 and Table A1 in Appendix A).\n\n4.1\nSynthetic seismic sections of the fault models\nIn the high-resolution synthetic seismic section of model M1 (F2 without damage zone; Figs. 3, 7a and 8\na), splaying of the F2-fault into segments F2a and F2b is clearly detectable. Internal layers in the fault block, between F2a and F2b, are also well imaged. According to the geological input model (Figs. 3b and 7a), F2a terminates within layer 8 and F2b penetrates up to URU at the base of layer 2 (Fig. 5). The fault tip of F2a is identified in the synthetic seismic section (#1, Fig. 8a), while the upper fault tip of F2b cannot be identified, thereby deviating from the geological model (#2). F2a is imaged below the fault block (#3), just before F2a and F2b merge. In the high-amplitude peak (red) in the deeper part, the fault plane itself is imaged, in what appears as a dragged reflective layer along the fault (#4).\nIn model M2 (F2 with damage zone; Fig. 7b), the fault is well imaged and both segments F2a and F2b are associated with strong reflections. The termination of F2b around layer 2 and where F2a tips within layer 8, are clearly seen (#5 and #6, Fig. 8b). Overall, there are more disturbances in the fault block between the two segments than outside this block. A smear of the lower boundaries of layers 10 and 14 from the faulted block, across F2b, can be detected in the synthetic seismic section of M2 (#7, Fig. 8b). Furthermore, parts of F2a below branch-point to F2b show enhanced reflections corresponding to the fault envelope having the widest damage zone (50\u00a0m). Near the branch-point, especially in the footwall of F2a, the amplitude is stronger, ascribed to overlapping, and hence, wider damage zones (#8, Fig. 8b). This is the case for models M2-M6, all consisting of an inner and outer damage zone (Fig. 7). The fault plane is imaged as dipping reflection along the entire fault.\nIn model M3 (Fig. 7c), gaseous CO2 fills all fractures in the hanging wall and footwall damage zones. The synthetic seismic section for this model (Fig. 8c) shows that the fault block between F2a and F2b remains discernible. There are weak reflections between the layers 8 and 10, but there is still an offset in top of layer 8 (#9, Fig. 8c). The layers and zones that are filled with gaseous CO2 appear brighter in the synthetic seismic sections (#8, Fig. 8c).\nModel M4 deviates from M3 in that CO2 is only filling the damage zone in the footwall of F2a (Fig. 7d). The synthetic seismic section of M4 (Fig. 8d) mimics that of M3 (Fig. 8c), clearly showing the termination of both F2a and F2b, and a strong amplitude in the F2a footwall (at #8).\nIn model M5, an isolated fracture corridor has been added to M2 east of F2 (Figs. 5a and 7e). This fracture corridor is well imaged in the synthetic seismic section, as a dipping signal modification, imaged as two to three dipping reflections (#10 in Fig. 9\nc) cutting the horizontal layers. In accordance with the geological model, there is no sign of stratigraphic offset.\nModel M6 presents a fault model with damage zone and a fracture corridor similar to M5. In addition, gaseous CO2 is present in the undamaged thickest sandstone layer in the deep parts and with envisioned leaks to the fractures in the F2a footwall damage zone and the fracture corridor (Fig. 7f). The blue reflections (trough) reflect very strong amplitudes in the footwall compared to the hanging wall. In the hanging wall, the same interval appears as two bright reflections with no reflections between them (#11, Fig. 9d). A depression to the right of the fracture corridor in the geological model (Fig. 7e and f), the sandy shale above the deepest and thickest sandstone layer, can be seen as an isolated depression (channel?) in the synthetic seismic section (#12 in Fig. 9b,d).\n\n\n4.2\nComparison of synthetic seismic sections\nIn the synthetic seismic sections for the fault models with damage zone (models M2-M6), the upper part of F2b is better imaged compared to the model without damage zone (M1) for which F2b does not cut layers 3 and 4 (Figs. 8 and 9). The damage zone and the fracture corridor of fault models M2-M6 appear wider in imaged synthetic seismic sections (Figs. 8 and 9) compared to the geological models (Fig. 7). The synthetic seismic results show that the fault appears better imaged in all cases when damage zones are added, mainly driven by stronger amplitudes (#8, Figs. 8 and 9).\nCO2-filled fractures create stronger (high-amplitude) reflections (models M3, M4 and M6; Figs. 8 and 9) as the change in elastic parameters results in larger changes in velocity and density from the undamaged rock to the deformed rock in the damage zones. The model with damage zone and CO2 in both the hanging wall and footwall (M3; Figs. 7c and 8c) shows less disturbance in the fault block between F2a and F2b than the model with damage zone and water-filled fractures (M2; Figs. 7b and 8b), but less internal layers than the model without damage zone (M1; Figs. 7a and 8a). The upper part of F2b has opposite polarity of the reflections (trough\/peak) in M3 compared to M2 and M4, which, in the upper part are similar since the fractures in M4 are filled with gas only in the footwall of F2a (between #9\/7 and #5 in Fig. 8b\u2013d). Fig. 8 also displays reflectivity and seismic wiggle traces for each model in a key location crossing the F2a and F2b and down to the thick sandstone layer (Figs. 3, 5 and 7). Closely spaced events in the reflectivity log compared to the seismic wiggle trace show widespread evidence of interference. Below the dotted line, the trace are the same for models M1-M5, and above the dotted line the wiggles for each model differs from each other. Where the CO2 is present, the amplitudes are stronger (Figs. 8 and 9).\nAt a first glance, the models with damage zones (models M2-M6; Figs. 7\u20139) appear very similar, however, the difference plots and the superposed seismic wiggle traces for the comparisons between two and two models document differences (Figs. 9e and 10\n). Since M2-M4 have the same fault geometry, the changes in seismic response are related to the effect of CO2 (Figs. 8 and 10), and the same is the case for M5 and M6 (Fig. 9e). In the difference plot between M3 and M4, there are two places along the fault zone where they are similar; hence no signal in the difference plots (Fig. 10c). This is where the thickest sandstone layers are present (Fig. 3b), which have no CO2 within the damage zone as they contain no fractures. The effect of injecting CO2 in the undamaged sandstone, the isolated fracture corridor and in the footwall damage zone above the sandstone layer is clearly visible in the difference plot of M5 and M6 (Fig. 9e).\n\n\n4.3\nSensitivity analysis of key geophysical parameters\nThe effects of utilizing different wavelets and incident angles for M2 and M5 are shown in Fig. 11. The synthetic seismic sections emphasize the importance of resolution in conventional and high-resolution seismic datasets; there is more interference of the reflections in the conventional synthetic section (7 reflections in the interval of 90\u2013200\u00a0m, compared to 14 in the same interval for the high-resolution, Fig. 11). In the conventional synthetic seismic the faulted block in between F2a and F2b is not resolved but is indicated by a disturbance (#13, Fig. 11b,d). Further, F2a and F2b are less prominent in the shallow part (above the faults splay around 240\u00a0m), but they can barely be detected at the termination near top layer 3 and at top of layer 8 (#5 and #6 in Fig. 11\nb,d).\nThe damage zone is not that well imaged in the conventional synthetic seismic sections compared to the high-resolution synthetic section, although it is possible to detect and identify the presence of the structure (#8, Fig. 11). The maximum width of the fracture corridor (5\u00a0m) is near the detection threshold for high-resolution data, and below the threshold for conventional seismic data. Despite this, the fracture corridor in M5 is imaged in both the high-resolution and conventional synthetic seismic section (Fig. 11c and d), with the fracture corridor seen as smeared reflections contrasting the surrounding reflective horizons (#10, Fig. 11).\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis of utilizing different illumination angles; 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 (perfect illumination) on M2 are shown in Fig. 12\n. For 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 illumination the fault is well imaged. However, the 30\u00b0 illumination case has problems imaging most of the fault segments.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nFault imaging in seismic data depends on geological constraints, such as truncation and offset of horizons, fault dip, geometry and intrinsic architecture, location of fault tips and process zones, and width and strain of relay ramps (3D aspects). The constraints combined with geophysical limitations (e.g., resolution) hinders fault interpretation. Most studies applying seismic modelling tools have targeted outcrop scenarios (e.g., Anell et al., 2016; Botter et al., 2017; Rabbel et al., 2018; Eide et al., 2018; Lubrano-Lavadera et al., 2018; Wrona et al., 2020). The advantage of using outcrops as conditioning is that they provide a viable geometric model (small details, geometries, segmentations etc.; Fig. 1). Shortcomings of this include the reliance on single unique locations often lacking measured petrophysical parameters. For some outcrops, samples are taken for laboratory petrophysical measurements but still there are uncertainties regarding how relevant these are making synthetic seismic for a subsurface cases. Another approach to building geological models for input to seismic modelling is by using analogue models (Kjoberg et al., 2017) or numerical discrete element models (DEM; Botter et al., 2014, 2016). This study is based on an approach that combines the impact of seismic and sub-seismic structures, such as damage zones, providing a realistic fault model, and has the potential to narrow the gap between seismic and outcrop data. Structural details known from outcrop studies are combined with shallow subsurface geophysical and geological information based on high-resolution seismic data and well data. The Hoop area was selected because of its unique database for such a generic study addressing to what degree detailed fault architectures and gas seeps can be detected and resolved in seismic data.\n\n5.1\nModel building and conditioning\nThe model building in this study with conditioning of the two damage zone bins (inner and outer), with deformation bands and\/or fractures for a combination of mixed lithologies, comes with uncertainties. These uncertainties can partly be ascribed to fault growth mechanisms and rheology (Braathen et al., 2013) and partly to layer mechanics (Ogata et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017). A model forecasting strict boundaries for deformation bands versus fracture damage zones, based in lithology and thereby excluding lithification effects (compaction, cementation), is a simplification. The forecasted changes in density and velocity for the inner and outer damage zone are therefore associated with uncertainties.\nAs the study is not directly based on outcrop data, where deformation features can be characterized in detail (e.g., types of deformation bands and fractures, frequency distribution etc.), simplifications to the models are made (Figs. 5 and 7). These simplifications are justified by the fact that seismic data resolution is below outcrop resolution, limiting what we can interpret from seismic data. The tuning of velocities for this study are literature based conceptual values (Sigernes, 2004; Botter, 2016; Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Agofack et al., 2018) and the density is estimated based on the estimated Vp. The succession was divided into four lithologies, and each layer is considered homogeneous for simplification (same velocity and density within each layer, differences inside and outside the damage zone; Fig. 5, Table 1 and Table A1 in Appendix A).\nThe basic fault model without a damage zone (M1; Figs. 3b and 7a) is based on high-resolution seismic data and hence represents an intermediate resolution case between outcrop and conventional seismic data (higher versus lower resolution, respectively). Design of the detailed models M2-M6 (Figs. 5 and 7) complies with the mentioned outcrop-derived empirical laws and gross geophysical conditioning. A natural next step would be to build and test fault models based on relevant outcrops having better resolution to make more detailed models to avoid the simplifications applied in this study. Ideally, this outcrop should also be sampled for laboratory measurements of key petrophysical parameters.\n\n\n5.2\nSeismic resolution and imaging of detailed fault architecture\nConventional 3D seismic data represent the norm for detailed fault studies in seismic data, while high-resolution P-Cable data still remains rare. The better resolution in the latter, however, allows greater recognition of details, such as subtle fault geometry and architecture. In this study, the P-Cable data achieves 3\u20137\u00a0m vertical resolution, compared to 15\u201325\u00a0m for the conventional seismic data. Structures at or below seismic resolution are clearly detected in the synthetic seismic (e.g., Figs. 8, 9 and 11). The introduction of gas within fractures of the damage zone (Figs. 8 and 10) and in a separate fracture corridor (Fig. 9), enhances the seismic signature of these features even further. These features are clearly detected in the synthetic seismic sections and show that tuning occurs within the limit of visibility (detection) and limit of separability (vertical resolution) in both types of seismic data (Fig. 11). In the high-resolution data, many of the details are resolved.\nThe fault models based on high-resolution seismic data from the Barents Sea provide a unique opportunity to investigate the use of high-resolution P-Cable data and the application of seismic attributes on both seismic data types for improving our capabilities in fault interpretation and gas detection. One limiting factor is that P-Cable data work best above the first seabed multiple in marine seismic data, hence covering the shallow subsurface (Planke et al., 2010; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). In the study area, water depths are about 450\u00a0m (600\u00a0ms TWT), allowing high-resolution data down to 1200\u00a0ms TWT (about 900\u00a0m below the seabed). As the targeted faults, analysed herein are shallow (upper 500\u00a0m below the seabed; Fig. 3), attenuation of seismic energy with depth is limited (Brown, 2011). Also, changes in velocities within the studied depth interval appear moderate (2,2\u20133,2\u00a0km\/s; Table A1 in Appendix A), limiting the impact of burial related compaction on velocity (Bj\u00f8rlykke and Jahren, 2015). There is, however, a decrease in dominant frequency down to the targeted geology, from 150\u00a0Hz to 90\u00a0Hz for the high-resolution data, while the conventional data shows minimal changes.\nThe introduced fault architecture adds sub-seismic structures (deformation bands and fractures) that will ultimately affect the seismic image. Strikingly, these added structures show up in the synthetic seismic sections, and are enhanced when introducing gas within fractures of the damage zones and in the fracture corridor (Figs. 8\u201310). Resolution, and hence identification of fault damage zones, is sensitive to velocity. According to Boadu (1997), fracture-induced velocity changes become insensitive to fracture density at higher strains. This sensitivity reflects a shift to domineering fracture properties overshadowing rock properties.\nWhen comparing seismic data to actual geology, it is important to consider the structural geometry in 1:1-scale so that the fault interpretation can be directly compared to faults in outcrop. Seismic sections are indeed often displayed with a high vertical exaggeration, which actually masks the impact of lateral resolution issues, though it is known that lateral resolution (combined with lack of illumination) are worse than the vertical resolution by at least a factor 2. In this study, most of the synthetic seismic sections are displayed in 1:1 scale (e.g., Figs. 8\u201310 and 12).\nSeismic attributes do not change or improve the objective uncertainty. However, they can be applied in various combinations to highlight details not immediately apparent. The time-slices through the variance cube show signal discontinuities up to 60\u201380\u00a0m wide that could reflect faults with damage zones (Fig. 2c). Given the bin size of the high-resolution seismic data, and the corresponding horizontal resolution, these zones have been sampled up to ten times across the fault zone. The results are promising with respect to mapping the widths of damage zones at different depths in the subsurface for deformed sedimentary units, similar to the conclusions drawn by Alaei and Torabi (2017) from a study of conventional seismic data. Of concern is that both the results of this study, along with those of Alaei and Torabi (2017), yield conceivable damage zones that are wider than those predicted by outcrop-based global trend lines. A strength of the seismic data is the 3D control that we usually lack in outcrops.\nThe fracture corridor in the synthetic seismic sections appears similar to features discernible in the shallow subsurface seismic data of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Serck et al., 2017) and the Hoop graben (Fig. 13\n). When interpreting the subsurface seismic data (both areas are covered by conventional 3D seismic data with 2\u00a0ms processing), these features are overlooked as no obvious explanation is available; they are not minor faults as they lack evidence of throw. Notably, they appear strikingly similar to fracture corridors encountered in the synthetic seismic sections, suggesting they represent tabular zones of joints. As they appear in shale-dominated successions, there could be a link to compaction that triggers polygonal faulting.\n\n\n5.3\nDetection of gas\nFaults are often associated with the formation of structural traps, and structural traps can be potential sites for CO2 storage. The lithology, juxtaposition, damage zone and fault-core will determine if a fault zone will be sealing or act as a potential conduit for fluids (e.g., Ogata et al., 2014). Seismic modelling of CO2 migration within a fault zone can provide insight into the detectability and seismic expression associated with such a scenario. This study focused on the detection of shallow CO2 in a gaseous phase, different from the more higher density supercritical state in which CO2 would be injected in a deeper reservoir. This study indicates that CO2 within fault damage zones and fracture corridors creates a significant signal compared to the base case scenario (Figs. 9e and 10) suggesting that it will be possible to monitor and detect CO2 leakage over time at repository locations.\nA powerful tool for comparison and detection of differences in synthetic seismic sections is the application of difference plots, comparing two images that can identify subtle changes in signals. In our analyses, difference plots especially detect alterations between fault zones with a damage zone with and without CO2 (Figs. 9e and 10).\nMonitoring technologies rely on time-lapse comparative seismic to detect changes with time (Arts et al., 2003; Chadwick et al., 2004; Eiken et al., 2011; Furre and Eiken, 2014), much like the difference plots generated here (Figs. 9e and 10). A recent analysis by Waage et al. (2021) suggests P-Cable technologies can serve as a valuable monitoring tool in detecting even small (low percentage saturation) leakages at 30\u2013300 times the detection limit of conventional seismic data. Further study into the limits in detecting different saturation models, with variations in distribution and changes in seismic parameters, would better constrain the threshold for identifying CO2 migration.\n\n\n\n6\nSummary and conclusions\nThis study explores detection and resolution thresholds in synthetic seismic data on fault architecture and gas seeps associated with a shallow fault imaged in P-Cable, high-resolution seismic data. The results are based on a detailed geological model with viable fault architecture including sub-seismic structures of damage zones, which is conditioned by outcrop-based empirical laws for fracture and deformation band distribution. Elastic parameters are conditioned by strain in four lithologies; sandstone, shaley sandstone, sandy shale and shale; in which damage zones of sandstone layers host deformation bands contrary to shale layers with fractures, or a combination of the two. This study utilized a 2D PSF-based seismic convolution modelling to generate PSDM-alike synthetic seismic data, thus including full resolution and illumination effects, though in 2D only due to the input models.\nThe main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Adding damage zones to the baseline fault model gives rise to stronger disturbances of the seismic signals within a broader zone; (2) High-resolution seismic data have the ability to detect and outline damage zones in the shallow subsurface; (3) An isolated, narrow fracture corridor is clearly visible as dipping reflections crossing the horizons, which shows no stratigraphic offset; (4) CO2-filled fractures in the damage zone and in the fracture corridor give a stronger seismic response than models without CO2; (5) Sensitivity tests show good imaging for illumination \u226545\u00b0, which is the average dip of the main fault segment; (6) These findings offer guidance for seismic monitoring, e.g., building realistic models for seismic modelling simulating time-lapse (4D) seismic in relation to CO2 storage.\n\n","73":"","74":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nGeological processes such as deformation, subsidence, fault slip and related earthquakes as well as fluid migration critically depend on the distribution of pressure and stress in the subsurface (Allen and Allen, 2013; Zoback, 2007). Likewise, planning and operation of safe drilling campaigns, fluid production and injection, and waste storage require an in-depth understanding of the distribution of subsurface pressure and stresses (Fjaer et al., 2008; Zoback, 2007). This is in particular valid, if pore pressure exceeds normal hydrostatic pressure, resulting in overpressured formations, which can significantly reduce the mechanical integrity of the subsurface (Suppe, 2014).\nIn most sediments, overpressure primarily forms as a result of rapid loading rates, which exceed sediment dewatering rates (Flemings, 2021; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Swarbrick and Osborne, 1998). As a consequence, the pore fluid cannot escape the pore space during loading, sediment compaction is impeded and the pore pressure increases above a hydrostatic level. This process usually depends on the presence of low permeability formations and is also known as disequilibrium compaction (Flemings, 2021; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Swarbrick and Osborne, 1998). In many areas, such as sedimentary basins, the loading source would usually be vertically oriented due to rapid burial, while in compressive settings horizontal loading can significantly contribute (Flemings, 2021; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Swarbrick and Osborne, 1998). Horizontal loading also includes shear enhanced compaction. Tectonic compression can also lead to uplift and erosion, both of which \u2013 depending on the rate \u2013 often dissipate overpressure (Luo and Vasseur, 1995).\nIn vertical loading-dominated areas, the relationship between vertical effective stress and the compaction-state of clay-rich sediments (shales) has been successfully used to estimate overpressure (e.g. Drews et al., 2018a; Heppard et al., 1998; Merrell et al., 2014). The advantage of this relationship is that it only requires an estimate of vertical stress, e.g. by integrating density data measured in a wellbore, and an understanding of the shale compaction behavior at hydrostatic pore pressure. The relationship between this normal shale compaction behavior and the actual disequilibrium compaction state can then be used to estimate pore pressure and overpressure (e.g. Eaton, 1972; Eaton, 1975; Yang and Aplin, 2004). The compaction state of shales can be determined by porosity-sensitive geophysical measurements, such as seismic\/sonic velocity (e.g. Bowers, 1995; Raiga-Clemenceau et al., 1986; Wyllie et al., 1956).\nIn compressive settings, such as fold-and-thrust-belts, sediment compaction and overpressure formation is more complex. Fold-and-thrust-belts usually consist of a deformed wedge which advances over undeformed strata. The latter forms the footwall below the basal detachment of the wedge and transitions into the undeformed foredeep in front of the wedge. Within and directly in front of the wedge, horizontal loading significantly contributes to overpressure formation (Flemings, 2021; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Swarbrick and Osborne, 1998). Here, utilizing vertical effective stress as a proxy for shale compaction will likely result in an underestimation of shale pore pressure (e.g. Couzens-Schultz and Azbel, 2014; Flemings and Saffer, 2018; Obradors-Prats et al., 2017). Nevertheless, vertical loading usually dominates below the basal detachment of fold-and-thrust-belt systems (Byrne and Fisher, 1990; Saffer and Tobin, 2011), which is often evidenced by velocity reversals and a sudden porosity increase (e.g. Bangs et al., 1990; Cochrane et al., 1994; Flemings and Saffer, 2018; Saffer and Tobin, 2011; Tsuji et al., 2008). The transition from horizontal loading in the wedge towards vertical loading-dominated far-field conditions is less rapid, but can still comprise only a few kilometers (cf. Flemings and Saffer, 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Obradors-Prats et al., 2017).\nAn onshore example, representing an overpressured system including a transition from wedge conditions to far-field conditions is given by the northern Alps behind and the North Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB) in front of the North Alpine Thrust Front (NATF) in SE Germany (cf. M\u00fcller and Nieberding, 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1988). The NATF divides the Alpine wedge from its foredeep (NAFB) and thus marks the northern structural outline of the European Alps.\nThe overpressure distribution along both sides of the NATF has only been addressed on the basis of drilling data of a few wells, yet (M\u00fcller and Nieberding, 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1988), whereas the overpressure distribution in the NAFB has been studied in more detail (Drews et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2020b; M\u00fcller and Nieberding, 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1988). However, the vertical and lateral distribution of pore pressure and overpressure mechanisms are yet poorly understood in the direct vicinity of the North Alpine Thrust Front. In particular, the impact of tectonic stress (or horizontal loading) compared to vertical stress (or vertical loading) on sediment compaction and hence overpressure formation is unknown. However, preliminary work by Lohr (1969, 1978) showed that seismic velocity in the NAFB increases towards the Alps, possibly as a result of increasing horizontal stress\/loading (cf. Lohr, 1978; M\u00fcller et al., 1988). Still, the lateral extent of the transition from horizontal loading behind the NATF towards vertical loading in front of the NATF is unclear as evidenced by the controversial discussion of horizontal stress propagation into the foreland (cf. Drews and Stollhofen, 2019; Drews et al., 2018a; Drews et al., 2020b; Reinecker et al., 2010; Ziegler and Heidbach, 2020; Ziegler et al., 2016).\nIn this study, we analyze the distribution of vertical stress, compaction, overpressure and horizontal loading using velocity, pore pressure and drilling data of 20 deep wellbores, which have been drilled on both sides and in direct vicinity of the North Alpine Thrust Front in SE Germany. The results are set into context with previously published interpretations of 2D seismic data (M\u00fcller, 1995; M\u00fcller et al., 1988; Ortner et al., 2015; Shipilin et al., 2020) and the relative timing of overpressure development and possible changes of loading mechanisms in the foredeep, wedge and footwall along the NATF will be discussed.\nThe study provides a unique reference case for overpressure development in onshore fold-and-thrust-belts for specialists working in the fields of geomechanics, structural geology and geodynamics and helps to mitigate pore pressure related drilling and exploration risks along the NATF in SE Germany.\n\n\n2\nRepresentation of pore pressure, vertical stress, vertical effective stress and overpressure\nPore pressure u and vertical stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\n are discussed and displayed as either absolute values in MPa, in combination as vertical effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n\n, as overpressure u* in MPa or in equivalent mud weight representation EMW in this study. The latter has the advantage that it directly relates to the density of the drilling fluid (mud) used to drill deep wellbores. The drilling fluid density (mud weight) is usually adjusted such that the wellbore pressure counterbalances the pore pressure of the drilled formation. Drilling mud weights often only reflect the driller's perception of pore pressure (cf. Drews et al., 2022; Mouchet and Mitchell, 1989), but still provide a valuable overpressure indicator. The equivalent mud weight EMW in g\/cm\u00b3 therefore allows for a representation of estimates and measurements of vertical stress and pore pressure in combination with drilling mud weights and calculates as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\nE\nM\nW\n=\n1000\n\u2217\n\nu\n\ng\n\u2217\nT\nV\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere units of the pore pressure u and the true vertical depth below ground level TVD are in MPa and m, respectively. An EMW > 1.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 reflects the presence of overpressure and we denote a pore pressure that translates to an EMW of 1.2-1.4\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 as mild, 1.4-1.6\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 as intermediate, 1.6-1.8\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 as high and >1.8\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 as very high overpressure. u can be also replaced by vertical stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\n to be represented in EMW.\nVertical effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n\n is defined as the difference between vertical stress and pore pressure:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\u2212\nu\n\n\n\nand becomes the vertical hydrostatic effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\n, if u is the hydrostatic pore pressure exerted by a vertical water column up to ground level.\nOverpressure u* is defined as the excess pore pressure above hydrostatic pore pressure. Overpressure is also expressed by \u03bb*, which is the fractional distance between hydrostatic and lithostatic or the fraction of overburden supported by the pore fluid:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\nu\n\u2217\n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nThe North Alpine Thrust Front (NATF) and North Alpine Foreland Basin (NAFB)\nThe Alpine wedge and NAFB represent a classical onshore fold-and-thrust-belt and foredeep system, divided by the NATF. The system comprises of passive margin sediments on top of crystalline basement and below foredeep sediments, both of which are partly subducted below an advancing wedge (Allen and Allen, 2013; Pfiffner, 1986). The Alpine wedge and NAFB formed as a result of the collision of the European and Adriatic plates at c. 35 Ma (e.g. Pfiffner, 1986; Schmid et al., 2004) and stretches from Geneva, Switzerland, in the West to Lower Austria and into the Carpathian foreland basin and thrust front system in the East. Thereby, the NAFB widens from West to East, reaches its maximum lateral extension in SE Germany (Fig. 1\nA) before it quickly narrows against the Bohemian Massif as its northeastern boundary (Schmid et al., 2004). Our study area along the NATF is constrained by Lake Constance in the West, the Austrian border in the East (west of Lake Chiemsee and south of the Landshut-Neu\u00f6tting-High), the Latitude of Munich in the North and the Alpine Nappes in the South (Fig. 1A and B).\n\n3.1\nStructural-stratigraphic subdivision of the study area\nThe study area is subdivided into three structural-stratigraphic units (Fig. 2\n), which, from youngest to oldest, represent the wedge, foredeep and footwall below the wedge and foredeep. The division builds on previous studies by Bachmann and M\u00fcller (1996), Bachmann et al. (1987), Kuhlemann and Kempf (2002) and Ortner et al. (2015).\n\n3.1.1\nSubalpine Molasse and Alpine Nappes (wedge)\nThe Subalpine Molasse is the outermost tectonic unit of the Alpine wedge (outer wedge). It contains deformed and thrusted foredeep sediments (Foreland Molasse; Fig. 2A) in front of the Alpine Nappes (Fig. 1A and B, Fig. 2B). The Alpine Nappes form the actual thrust sheets of the Alps and are also part of the wedge (inner wedge).\nThe N\u2013S width of the Subalpine Molasse diminishes from West to East in SE Germany and finally tapers out around Lake Chiemsee approximately 30\u00a0km westward of the German-Austrian border (Schmid et al., 2004) (Fig. 1A). Thin-skinned thrusting included both, in-sequence-thrusting followed by out-of-sequence thrusting within the Subalpine Molasse (Ortner et al., 2015; Schuller et al., 2015; von Hagke et al., 2014). The former resulted in the formation of a prominent triangle zone due to duplex thrusting in the western part of the study area (Ortner et al., 2015) (Fig. 2B). In the eastern part of the Alpine fold-and-thrust-belt and foredeep system in SE Germany, the triangle zone is only weakly expressed or completely missing (Fig. 2B).\n\n\n3.1.2\nForeland Molasse (foredeep and footwall of wedge)\nThe Foreland Molasse is the undeformed foredeep of the Alps filled with Cenozoic Molasse sediments on top of Mesozoic Passive Margin Sediments. Cenozoic sedimentation is characterized by two distinct megacycles, each starting in a marine setting and progressing with a subsequent marine regression and shift towards a terrestrial depositional environment (Bachmann and M\u00fcller, 1996; Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002; Sissingh, 1997) (Fig. 2A). During Oligocene times, a geographic transition from a terrestrial depositional environment in the West towards a marine depositional environment in the East is reflected by a decreasing grain size trend from West to East and the presence of brackish-water sediments in the transition zone (Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002) (Fig. 2A). This grain size trend is also expressed in the Oligocene sediments of the Subalpine Molasse (Ortner et al., 2015). Sheared and subducted Foreland Molasse shales of Oligocene age also form the basal detachment and footwall below the wedge of the Subalpine Molasse and the Alpine Nappes (Bachmann et al., 1981; Ortner et al., 2015) (Fig. 2A and B).\nClose to the wedge, the Foreland Molasse is called Tilted Molasse, which is characterized by mostly foreland-dipping Foreland Molasse sediments above the triangle zone of the Subalpine Molasse (Fig. 2B). Analogous to the triangle zone, the Tilted Molasse is only weakly expressed or even missing in the eastern part of the study area (Fig. 2B).\n\n\n3.1.3\nMesozoic passive margin sediments (footwall below foredeep and below wedge)\nAutochthonous Mesozoic passive margin sediments of the European plate below the Foreland Molasse are present in the entire study area on top of mostly pre-Mesozoic sediment troughs and Variscan crystalline basement rocks (Fig. 2A). Mesozoic passive margin sediments include Upper Triassic sandstones, Lower and Mid Jurassic shales, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous carbonates and Upper Cretaceous shales (Bachmann and M\u00fcller, 1996; Bachmann et al., 1987). While Upper Jurassic carbonates are present in the entire study area, Lower and Mid Jurassic shales are only present in the central and western part and Cretaceous sediments are only present in the central and eastern parts of the study area. Triassic sandstones are only locally preserved within minor graben systems. Mesozoic passive margin sediments are also subducted below the wedge of the Subalpine Molasse and Alpine Nappes (Fig. 2B). Since the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic carbonates share the same pressure regime in the NAFB (Drews et al., 2018a, 2020b; Lemcke, 1976) they are summarized as Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates in this study.\n\n\n\n3.2\nCurrent understanding of pore pressure along the NATF\nDespite the significance of the Subalpine Molasse, Foreland Molasse and Mesozoic passive margin sediments for past hydrocarbon exploration (Bachmann et al., 1981; Lemcke, 1979) and more recent deep geothermal production (Agemar et al., 2014b; Flechtner and Aubele, 2019), few studies addressed the distribution of pore pressure in front of the NATF (Drews et al., 2018a, 2022; Lemcke, 1976; M\u00fcller et al., 1988) and behind the NATF (M\u00fcller et al., 1988). Overpressure is present in the south and southeast in Foreland Molasse sediments of Oligocene and Eocene age and underlying shales of Late Cretaceous age as evidenced by drilling data and velocity data from wells located in the undeformed foredeep (Drews et al., 2018a; M\u00fcller et al., 1988) (Fig. 1A and B). Pore pressure in equivalent mud weight can exceed 1.8\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 in the south-eastern part of the NAFB in SE Germany (Drews et al., 2018a; M\u00fcller et al., 1988).\nMesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates and underlying formations are generally hydrostatically pressured or underpressured (Drews et al., 2018a; Lemcke, 1976; M\u00fcller et al., 1988) and follow the hydraulic head of the Danube river in the North (Lemcke, 1976). Along the Danube River, the carbonates of the Upper Jurassic are expressed at the surface (Fig. 1A and B).\nWithin and below the wedge, overpressure is also present; however, it has only been investigated by maximum drilling mud weights (M\u00fcller et al., 1988) and exemplarily at a few well locations (Drews and Stollhofen, 2019). Here, pore pressure EMW-magnitudes in excess of 2.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 have been reported and have mainly been attributed to \u201ctectonic compaction\u201d by M\u00fcller et al. (1988) and M\u00fcller and Nieberding (1996). A general increase of compaction and possibly horizontal loading has also been supported by the preliminary work by Lohr (1969, 1978) who noted a general increase of seismic velocities towards the Alps, but did not consider the effect of lithological variation and compaction disequilibrium due to overpressure.\n\n\n\n4\nData\nThe dataset includes 20 wells (sidetracks not counted, Table 1\n) and 7 cross-sections, which are based on previously published interpretations of seismic sections from M\u00fcller (1995), M\u00fcller et al. (1988), Ortner et al. (2015) and Shipilin et al. (2020) (Fig. 3\n). 7 wells are located in the Foreland Molasse, close and along to the NATF; 12 wells have their surface location in the Subalpine Molasse; and one well was drilled through the Alpine Nappes into the Subalpine Molasse (Fig. 3). Four Foreland Molasse wells have reached the Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates. Five Subalpine Molasse wells have penetrated the basal detachment and reached at least the subducted part of the Foreland Molasse. The well dataset contains drilling\/logging mud weights (19 wells), formation tops (20 wells), cutting descriptions (16 wells), pressure data (13 wells) and velocity data (19 wells).\nThe data have been derived from geological well reports, the geological division of the Environmental Agency of Bavaria, end of well reports and previously published datasets (Drews et al., 2020b; M\u00fcller, 1970, 1995; M\u00fcller et al., 1988). Logging mud weights have been retrieved from the headers of geophysical well logs and usually reflect the maximum mud weight used within the logged section. An overview for each well and respective data sources is given in Table 1.\n\n\n5\nMethods\nThe drilling and velocity dataset are analyzed in four steps to investigate the relationship between overpressure, compaction, vertical and horizontal loading along the NATF in SE Germany:\nFirst, we look at bulk sediment compaction by comparing modelling parameters of velocity-constrained density and vertical stress profiles along each well.\nSecond, we combine drilling and velocity data to estimate vertical pore pressure profiles at each well location. The resulting overpressure distribution is investigated on a regional scale in relation to the structural position within, below or in front of the wedge.\nThird, shale velocity is analyzed as a function of vertical effective stress to assess the impact of mechanisms other than vertical loading on the compaction state of shales in the different tectonic units along the NATF.\nAs a fourth and last step, we further delineate the impact of vertical vs horizontal loading on overpressure by considering the structural evolution and related relative timing of overpressure formation in context of the present day overpressure distribution.\n\n5.1\nVertical stress estimation\n\n5.1.1\nVertical stress integration from different data sources\nEstimates of vertical stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\n are required for both pore pressure and compaction analyses. For reasons of simplicity, we assume that vertical stress is a principal stress component of the stress tensor in the entire study area. Vertical stress can be estimated by integrating the weight of the overlying material (e.g. Flemings, 2021; Zoback, 2007):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n=\n\n\n\u222b\n0\nz\n\n\nr\nh\n\no\nb\n\n\n(\nz\n)\n\ng\nd\nz\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere rho\n\nb\n is the bulk density which varies with depth z and g is the Earth's gravitational acceleration at 9.81\u00a0m\/s2. In this study, depth is always provided as true vertical depth below ground level TVD.\nBulk density rho\n\nb\n is ideally derived from density logs or, in case of missing density data, indirectly from sonic logs or vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. In this study, density data is not available at sufficient quality and quantity and therefore sonic log and VSP data are converted to a density profile by employing Gardner's velocity-density transform (Gardner et al., 1974):\n\n(5)\n\n\nr\nh\n\no\nb\n\n=\n0.23\n\u2217\n\n\n(\n\nV\np\n\n\u2217\n3.281\n)\n\n0.25\n\n\n\n\nwhere V\n\np\n is the interval velocity in m\/s. When using geophysical well logs, we apply a 30\u00a0m moving average filter to smooth and eliminate outlier readings and small-scale lithological variations.\nIn the case where neither density nor velocity data are available, a density profile can be estimated using an Athy-type porosity decay function (Athy, 1930) modified for vertical effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\u2032\n\n\n (Heppard et al., 1998; Hubbert and Rubey, 1959; Scott and Thomsen, 1993):\n\n(6)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\n\n\u03c6\n0\n\n\u2217\nexp\n\n(\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\/\nC\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03c6\n\n0\n are the porosity at vertical hydrostatic effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\n and at the surface, respectively. C is a compaction constant and typically set to 31\u00a0MPa\u22121 in the study area according to Drews et al. (2018a) and Drews et al. (2019). In combination with an estimate of grain density and pore water density, the resulting porosity profile can be converted into a bulk density profile.\n\n\n5.1.2\nCalibration of \u03c60 to model vertical stress and related bulk sediment compaction\nIn combination with constant grain and fluid densities and assuming hydrostatic pore pressure, equation (6) can be used to model a density profile which can be integrated to a vertical stress profile (equation (4)). In order to investigate the combined effect of lithological composition and compaction on vertical stress we fit equation (6) to data-derived vertical stress profiles by iteratively solving for \u03c6\n\n0\n. Thereby, C is kept constant at 31\u00a0MPa\u22121. The process is iterative, because no-data intervals are filled with a density estimate that results from equation (6) and constant grain and fluid densities, using the following workflow:\n\n1)\nEmploy Gardner's density-velocity relationship (Gardner et al., 1974) to convert velocity data into density data.\n\n\n2)\nFill no-data gaps of the resulting velocity-based density profile with a modelled density, using equation (6) with C\u00a0=\u00a031\u00a0MPa\u22121 and matrix and fluid densities of 2.7 and 1.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3, respectively.\n\n\n3)\nIntegrate the resulting vertical density profile to a vertical stress profile (equation (4)) represented in EMW (equation (1)).\n\n\n4)\nModel a vertical density profile using equation (6) with C\u00a0=\u00a031\u00a0MPa\u22121 and matrix and fluid densities of 2.7 and 1.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3, respectively.\n\n\n5)\nIntegrate the resulting density model to a vertical stress profile (equation (4)) represented in EMW (equation (1)).\n\n\n6)\nIteratively solve for \u03c6\n\n0\n in steps 2) and 4) until the vertical stress profiles represented in EMW and generated in steps 3) and 5) have a minimum least square difference. \u03c6\n\n0\n is identical in steps 2) and 4).\n\n\n\nThe resulting \u03c6\n\n0\n represents the best fit vertical stress model and is a measure for the overall compaction state and lithological composition at the respective well location.\n\n\n\n5.2\nPore pressure analysis\nPore pressure is analyzed on a well-by-well basis. We integrate drilling indicators such as drilling\/logging mud weights in combination with mud gas readings, pressure tests (e.g. wireline formation tests and\/or drill stem tests) as well as kill mud weights or shut-in drill pipe pressures during reported kick control incidents. In addition, we consider shale pore pressure estimated from velocity data using Eaton's pore pressure transform (Eaton, 1972, 1975):\n\n(7)\n\n\nu\n=\n\n\u03c3\nv\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2217\n\n\n(\n\n\nV\n\np\n,\no\nb\ns\n.\n\n\n\nV\n\np\n,\nN\nC\nT\n\n\n\n)\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nwhere V\n\np,obs.\n is the observed shale velocity and V\n\np,NCT\n is the expected shale velocity at a given vertical hydrostatic effective stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\n. The observed shale velocity is derived from sonic log data by either employing a gamma ray (variable) and\/or deep resistivity (<10\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0m) cut-off (cf. Table 1 for an overview of used shale discriminators for each well) or from VSP data in combination with cutting descriptions.\n\nDrews et al. (2018a) constrained V\n\np,NCT\n to velocity data of hydrostatically pressured shales in the NAFB (Fig. 4\n) by combining equation (6) and a porosity-velocity transform for shales (modified from Raiga-Clemenceau et al., 1986):\n\n(8)\n\n\n\n\nV\np\n\n\n,\nNCT\n\n\n\u00a0\n=\n\u00a0\n5076\n\u00a0m\/s\u00a0\u2217\u00a0\n\n\n(\n1\n-\n\n\u03c6\nshale\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03c6\n\nshale\n is the shale porosity, and, according to Drews et al. (2018a) can be computed as follows in the NAFB (cf. equation (6)):\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\ns\nh\na\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n0.4\n\u2217\nexp\n\n(\n\u2212\n\n\u03c3\n\nv\n,\nh\ny\nd\n\n\u2032\n\n\/\n31\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting normal compaction trend for shale velocity uses vertical effective stress as a proxy for sediment compaction and should thus only yield reasonable results where overpressure is primarily generated by vertical loading. Application of this methodology to velocity data in a fold-and-thrust-belt setting should therefore provide insights on the impact of horizontal loading, uplift and erosion on compaction and overpressure generation.\n\n\n5.3\nExtraction of overpressure and velocity-vertical effective stress pairs\nOverpressure is extracted from either measured pore pressures (drill stem tests, wireline formation tests, kicks or kill mud weights) or maximum pore pressure estimates per stratigraphic unit. The latter also considers general drilling\/logging mud weights and shale pore pressure estimated from velocity data.\nVertical effective stress is derived from pore pressure and vertical stress estimates of all wells with velocity data (cf. Table 1). Hereby, pore pressure profiles for each well are guided by its available pore pressure indicators. In order to account for the uncertainty related to unresolvable lithological variations, shale velocity and estimated vertical effective stress data pairs are derived by employing two different methodologies:\n\n1)\nGamma ray or deep resistivity guided filtering of sonic logs for shale-rich sequences and subsequent averaging by using a 30\u00a0m moving window. The resulting average shale velocity profiles are directly displayed versus estimated vertical effective stress.\n\n\n2)\nComputing arithmetic averages of velocity data and vertical effective stress estimates from the clay-rich Oligocene age formations only for each well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nResults\n\n6.1\nBulk sediment compaction and modelled vertical stress\nThe inferred initial porosity (\u03c6\n\n0\n, equation (6) and workflow described in section 5.1.2) indicates that sediments are more densified (lower \u03c6\n\n0\n) within the wedge at a given depth than outboard in the foredeep (Fig. 5\nA). Thereby, \u03c6\n\n0\n decreases as a function of distance to the NATF when starting from in front of the wedge (Fig. 5A). In addition, \u03c6\n\n0\n also decreases from East to West in front of the wedge (Fig. 5B). This trend is less pronounced at well locations behind the NATF (Fig. 5B). However, behind of the NATF, \u03c6\n\n0\n is always lower, when compared to locations in front of the NATF at similar Easting (Fig. 5B).\nThe observed densification trends are most likely impacted by different factors: An eastward change of the depositional environment of Foreland Molasse sediments towards a more marine setting (cf. Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002) and the onset of overpressure (cf. Drews et al., 2018a) reflect an increase in clay content and probably undercompaction from West to East and thus densification in the opposite direction. However, since the same lithological variations are present within the Subalpine Molasse (Ortner et al., 2015), the densification (decreasing \u03c6\n\n0\n) towards and within the wedge most likely indicates an increase of compaction either due to uplift\/erosion, horizontal loading or a combination of both processes. We would like to point out that these findings are in concordance with and expand the preliminary work by Lohr (1969, 1978), who noted a general increase of seismic velocities towards the Alps.\nFinally, the resulting initial porosities \u03c6\n\n0\n can be used to model vertical stress (equations (4) and (6), in combination with constant grain and fluid densities of 2.7\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 and 1.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3, respectively). Analogous to the decrease of \u03c6\n\n0\n\n, vertical stress then increases towards and into the wedge (Fig. 5A). Hereby, vertical stress could be up to 7\u00a0MPa higher at a depth of 4\u00a0km within or below the wedge when compared to vertical stress at the same depth in front of the wedge (Fig. 5A and B).\n\n\n6.2\nPore pressure distribution\n\n6.2.1\nPore pressure in front of the wedge: Mesozoic passive margin sediments and Foreland Molasse (foredeep)\nAlthough the investigated wells in front of the wedge are in a distance <10\u00a0km to the NATF (cf. Fig. 5A), the relative pore pressure distribution generally follows previous pore pressure studies in front of the wedge (Fig. 6\n) (Drews et al., 2018a; Lemcke, 1976; M\u00fcller et al., 1988).\nThe Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates of early Cretaceous and late Jurassic age are generally (sub-)hydrostatically pressured, as previously reported by Lemcke (1976). Overpressure in Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene shales is increasing from West to East, with hydrostatic pore pressure in the very Western part of the study area (Fig. 6). In the East, pore pressure in front of the wedge exceeds 2.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 in EMW in Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene shales (see Vagen 1 and Endorf 2 wells in Fig. 6). Previously, such magnitudes have only been observed by maximum drilling mud weights (M\u00fcller and Nieberding, 1996; M\u00fcller et al., 1988) and can now be confirmed by additional drilling, pore pressure and velocity data.\nMoreover, not only the magnitude of overpressure is increasing from West to East, but also the vertical thickness of the overpressured zone (Fig. 6). This can be explained with significantly thicker Chattian, Rupelian and Upper Cretaceous shale packages in the East of the study area (cf. Bachmann et al., 1987; Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002). Upper Cretaceous shale thickness decreases from >500\u00a0m in the East to less than <100\u00a0m in the central part and Cretaceous sediments are completely missing in the western part of the study area (Fig. 6). The effect of Upper Cretaceous thickness is also underpinned by a shallower onset of the pore pressure regression in wells with a significantly thinner Upper Cretaceous section (cf. Geretsried GEN-1 well on Fig. 6) which is in agreement with earlier studies by Drews et al. (2018a) and Drews et al. (2020b).\n\n\n6.2.2\nPore pressure within the wedge: Subalpine Molasse\nIn contrast to the overpressure trend in front of the wedge, overpressure is decreasing from West to East in the Subalpine Molasse (Fig. 6). Shale velocity data often yields an underestimate of shale pore pressure within the wedge, when using a vertical effective stress based compaction trend and pore pressure transform (cf. equations (7)\u2013(9); Fig. 6).\nWithin surface connected thrust sheets of the western Subalpine Molasse, significant overpressure only builds up within clay-rich formations. For example, very high overpressure is encountered in the Immenstadt 1 well location while hydrostatic pore pressure prevails along the Seeg 1 well (Figs. 6 and 7\n). Nevertheless, the exact structural position of the Immenstadt 1 well is not known, since the well has been projected on section 2 (cf. Fig. 3). However, other studies addressing the deformation style of this area also project the Immenstadt 1 well behind the triangle zone (e.g. Zerlauth et al., 2014).\nPresence of overpressure in the duplexes and\/or triangle zone yields pore pressures in excess of 2.0\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 in EMW (cf. Sulzberg 1 and Kempten 1\/1a on Figs. 6 and 7). In particular, two kicks in the same lithostratigraphic unit in the Kempten 1 and 1a wells, but from different thrust sheets of the triangle zone, yield overpressure magnitudes of 34\u00a0MPa at 3380\u00a0m and 47\u00a0MPa at 4160\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 7, section 2). These very high overpressure kicks provide direct evidence of the extreme pore pressure contrast between the overpressured wedge and its hydrostatically pressured foredeep in the western part of the study area (cf. Elbsee 1 on Figs. 6 and 7).\nIn the central and eastern part of the Subalpine Molasse, the triangle zone is less expressed or missing (Fig. 8\n), because emergent forethrusts take up almost all shortening and the triangle zones were abandoned before they could grow large. Only intermediate overpressure (1.4\u20131.6\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 in EMW) can be observed in these isolated duplexes (cf. Grambach 1 well on Figs. 6 and 8) and in Oligocene age shales of the surface connected thrust sheets (cf. well data in the Subalpine Molasse eastwards of Kaufbeuren on Figs. 6 and 8).\n\n\n6.2.3\nPore pressure below the wedge (footwall): subducted Mesozoic passive margin sediments and subducted Foreland Molasse\nIn contrast to their counterparts in front of the wedge, subducted Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates (Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic) below the Subalpine Molasse can be significantly overpressured (Figs. 6\u20138), although a pressure regression is usually still observable (cf. Sulzberg 1 and Miesbach 1 wells, Fig. 6).\nThe subducted parts of the Foreland Molasse (Oligocene shales) and Upper Cretaceous shales are always highly overpressured with pore pressures that translate to EMWs between 1.8 and 2.3\u00a0g\/cm\u00b3 (Fig. 6). Also, estimated shale pore pressure from velocity data yields a good match with observed pore pressure magnitudes (Fig. 6). However, some uncertainty is related to the pore pressure magnitudes around the basal detachment in the central part of the study area. Here, pressure might drop below the basal detachment to increase again in the fairly thick subducted Foreland Molasse where it converges towards lithostatic stress. This possible pressure inversion is usually highlighted by a discrepancy between pore pressure indicators from drilling data and velocity data (cf. question marks of Grambach 1, Staffelsee 1 and Oberhof 1 wells on Fig. 6) and could be related to shear enhanced compaction in the detachment. However, these inconsistencies require further investigation, for example pore-scale analysis of core samples from the detachment and\/or numerical modelling of deformation-driven compaction along the NATF.\n\n\n6.2.4\nRegional overpressure trends within, below and in front of the wedge\nIn the study area, an upper limit overpressure \n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n increases linearly with TVD (black dotted line in Fig. 9\nA):\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n=\n0.0194\n\n\nM\nP\na\n\nm\n\n\u2217\nT\nV\nD\n\u2212\n33.47\nM\nP\na\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the foredeep, overpressure onsets at shallower depths within the wedge (Fig. 9B). Pore fluids within the wedge are supporting up to 60% of the vertical overburden load at 3000\u00a0m and more than 70% below 4000\u00a0m (Fig. 9B). The shallowest onset of overpressure is within shales of the forethrusts at depths below 2000 m. Below 3000\u00a0m, overpressure also reaches the maximum overpressure trend (\n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n, equation (10)) in the triangle zone and duplex thrusts (Fig. 9B). In front and below the wedge, overpressure is approaching \n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n below 4000\u00a0m. Within Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates, ovepressure can also be observed below 4000\u00a0m and quickly converges towards \n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n at depths >5000\u00a0m (Fig. 9B).\nBased on \n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n, a range of \n\n\n\u03bb\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n can be calculated. The range results from variable \u03c6\n\n0\n used to model vertical stress (cf. Fig. 5), which is required to calculate \u03bb* (cf. equation (3)). Interestingly, \n\n\n\u03bb\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n extrapolates to values\u00a0>\u00a00.95\u00a0at depths of 6\u20138.5\u00a0km, when speculating that \n\n\nu\nmax\n\u2217\n\n\n keeps linearly increasing according to equation (10) (Fig. 9A and B). The resulting depth range correlates with the depth where the basal detachment and post-Mesozoic footwall below the Subalpine Molasse converge towards a subhorizontal dip (cf. Figs. 6\u20138). Natural seismic focal depths below the Subalpine Molasse roughly coincide with this depth range, too (Department Of Earth And Environmental Sciences, 2001).\n\n\n\n6.3\nVelocity as a function of vertical effective stress in front, within and below the wedge\nCenozoic and Mesozoic shale velocity and average velocity of Oligocene age sediments are investigated as a function of estimated vertical effective stress to assess the role of horizontal loading, uplift and erosion on compaction and overpressure development in front, within and below the wedge (Fig. 10\n).\nShale velocity from wells located in front of, but very close to, the wedge (Fig. 10A, D) still follows the NCT calibrated to hydrostatically pressured shales in the NAFB. However, a diversion towards faster velocities can also be seen in velocity data of shales, which currently experience a vertical effective stress of less than 10\u00a0MPa (Fig. 10A). These elevated velocities are mostly related to the shallower sequences of the Upper and Lower Freshwater Molasse, Brackish Molasse and Upper Marine Molasse (cf. Fig. 2), all of which are characterized by alternating sequences of shale, sandstone and carbonate-rich sediments. The resulting heterolithic character complicate the process of consistent shale picking, which is likely the reason for higher velocites.\nSediments within the wedge (Subalpine Molasse) have significantly faster velocities (Fig. 10B, D) over a similar range of vertical effective stress when compared to the NCT by Drews et al. (2018a) and shales in front of the wedge (Fig. 10A). With increasing vertical effective stress, the discrepancy between shale velocity in the wedge and in front of the wedge is decreasing (Fig. 10D). However, a clear distinction between horizontal loading and uplift\/erosion is not possible on the basis of velocity data only (Fig. 10D).\nThe present day loading conditions below the wedge follow the same velocity-vertical effective stress trend that has been observed in front of the wedge (Fig. 10C). Shale velocity (subducted Foreland Molasse and Mesozoic Passive Margin Sediments) and average velocity data from Oligocene sediments in the footwall follow the NCT of Drews et al. (2018a) over a large range of vertical effective stresses (Fig. 10C and D).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nOverpressure vs vertical loading, uplift\/erosion and horizontal loading along the NATF\nThe heterogeneous pore pressure distribution along the NATF in SE Germany allows for an interpretation of the relative timing of overpressure generation in front, within and below the wedge. In combination with the presented velocity-vertical effective stress relationships, the role of horizontal vs vertical loading in front, within and below the wedge can be assessed.\n\n7.1.1\nOverpressure development and loading in front of the wedge\nIn front of the wedge, velocity data correlates well with vertical effective stress and shale velocity matches the NCT previously established in the NAFB (Drews et al., 2018a) (Fig. 10). Thereby, overpressure in the central and eastern parts matches peak sedimentation and burial rates during late Oligocene and early Miocene times (Drews et al., 2018a; Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002; Zweigel, 1998). Accordingly, overpressure in front of the wedge can be assumed to be predominantly a result of vertical loading due to rapid subsidence\/sedimentation and the presence of thick low-permeability shale packages in the central and eastern parts of the study area. Nevertheless, hydrostatic pore pressure prevailed in the western part in front of the wedge (cf. Fig. 6), which is likely related to the lithological shift towards less clay-rich and more permeable sediments and the absence of Upper Cretaceous shales (cf. Bachmann et al., 1987; Kuhlemann and Kempf, 2002) (cf. Fig. 2).\n\n\n7.1.2\nOverpressure development and loading within the wedge\nIn the west, overpressure is not present in front of the wedge (cf. Fig. 6), suggesting that significant overpressure has likely never built up in this part of the foredeep. Consequently, the observed significant overpressure in the western parts of the wedge (cf. Fig. 6) has most likely been generated syntectonically. Even compared to the overpressured parts of the foredeep, overpressure develops with higher magnitudes at shallower depth in the wedge than in front of the wedge (Fig. 9), while velocity does not follow the vertical effective stress trend of the foredeep (Fig. 10). Only below 4000\u00a0m overpressure magnitudes match magnitudes in front of the wedge (Fig. 9), which is probably marking the depth where vertical loading also dominates within the wedge. Consequently, mechanisms in addition to vertical loading are contributing to overpressure development within the wedge at depths shallower than 4000\u00a0m.\nA precise assessment of the possible role of uplift, erosion, horizontal and vertical loading within the wedge would require more detailed analyses, such as pore scale compaction studies of core samples from the wedge. Still, some general conclusions regarding overpressure development and loading within the wedge can be made based on the presented pore pressure and velocity data:\nWithin the triangle zone and duplex thrusts, uplift\/erosion is minimal in comparison to shortening (Fig. 7) and horizontal loading is most likely the key driver of overpressure development.\nWithin imbricates in the western part of the study area, uplift\/erosion can be assumed to amount several 100s\u20131000\u00a0s\u00a0m, depending on the structural position (Fig. 7). Here, overpressure develops at the shallowest depths in the entire study area (Fig. 9) and uplift\/erosion is eventually an additional source of overpressure.\nIn the central and eastern imbricates of the wedge, pore pressure is less than in front of the wedge (Fig. 6). Excess pore pressure has thus never been developed or has been released during uplift\/erosion. M\u00fcller et al. (1988) also suggest that bedding parallel pressure release towards the surface along the tilted forethrusts might be a possible cause of reduced or missing overpressure.\n\n\n7.1.3\nOverpressure development and loading below the wedge (subducted Foreland Molasse sediments)\nVelocity data indicate that vertical loading is probably dominating below the wedge in the entire study area (Fig. 10). Since hydrostatic pore pressure prevails in front of the western wedge, overpressure in the western footwall (subducted Foreland Molasse), must have also developed syntectonically as a result of rapid vertical loading due to the advancing thrust front. Rapid overthrusting of the western footwall is in agreement with the structural-kinematic model proposed by Ortner et al. (2015). In the central and eastern part of the study area, overpressure below the wedge is probably less influenced by overthrusting, since the sediments have already been overpressured due to fast basin subsidence and high sedimentation rates (Drews et al., 2018a, 2020b) (Fig. 6).\n\n\n7.1.4\nOverpressure development and loading below the wedge (Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates)\nIn addition to rapid vertical loading, overpressure in Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates below the wedge is most likely also a result of deteriorated reservoir quality. In front of the wedge, Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates normally display exceptional hydraulic properties and connectivity: hydrothermal production from Upper Jurassic carbonates often exceed flow rates of 360\u00a0m\u00b3\/h (Agemar et al., 2014a) and the pressure regime is consistently (sub-)hydrostatic, following the hydraulic head of the Danube River - even at depths of 4000\u00a0m below ground level (Lemcke, 1976). However, this is not the case for deep geothermal projects which are closest to the NATF. Here, five out of six projects either failed due to poor reservoir quality of the Upper Jurassic carbonates or produce at significantly reduced flow rates (BVG, 2019; Drews et al., 2022; Drews et al., 2020a; Flechtner and Aubele, 2019). Accordingly, a loss of hydraulic connectivity has been observed by a decrease of matrix permeability and porosity of Upper Jurassic carbonates with increasing effective stress (Bohnsack et al., 2020, 2021). Thereby, the role of diagenetically-driven fault sealing could also be a possible mechanism (cf. Figs. 7 and 8).\nWe therefore speculate that reservoir quality of Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates is first reduced by mechanical and chemical compaction and local fault sealing at depths greater than 4000\u00a0m. This self-sealing process might then prevent further hydraulic communication and dewatering towards the Danube River in the north of the NAFB. Secondly, overpressure possibly develops and quickly converges towards lithostatic magnitudes in the self-sealed carbonates due to the additional and rapidly occurring vertical load of the advancing wedge.\n\n\n\n7.2\nComparison with other fold-and-thrust-belt systems and implications for the N\u2013S extent of the transition zone between horizontal and vertical loading along the NATF\nThe above described interpretation of overpressure development and sediment compaction matches the generic loading pattern of other onshore fold-and-thrust-belt and foreland basin systems like the Assam foreland basin in NE India (Dasgupta et al., 2019) or well-studied offshore accretionary prisms such as the Nankai accretionary prism (Flemings and Saffer, 2018; Karig, 1986; Saffer and Tobin, 2011; Tsuji et al., 2008), Sabah fold belt (Couzens-Schultz and Azbel, 2014), Barbados Ridge complex (Bangs et al., 1990; Saffer and Tobin, 2011; Yaolin and Chi-Yuen, 1988) or the Oregon accretionary prism (Cochrane et al., 1994). In all these locations, horizontal loading impacts the wedge, while vertical loading conditions control compaction and overpressure formation in front and below the wedge.\nNumerical modelling of fold-and-thrust-belt systems have also reproduced these patterns and also indicate that the transition from wedge conditions (horizontal loading contributes) to far-field conditions in front of the wedge (vertical loading dominates) can span only a few kilometers (Gao et al., 2018; Obradors-Prats et al., 2017). Our study allows us to confirm such a narrow transition zone for onshore fold-and-thrust-belts: all wells in front of the wedge are in a distance of less than 10\u00a0km to the NATF and indicate vertical loading is predominant. We therefore propose that the lateral transition zone between horizontal loading and vertical loading conditions along the NATF must be smaller than 10\u00a0km and is likely confined to the zone between the northern limits of the Subalpine Molasse and Tilted Molasse (cf. Figs. 2B and 3). This idea is supported by strain analysis based on the deformation of clastic components within Cenozoic conglomerates from different structural elements of the Molasse Basin (wedge \u2013 foredeep \u2013 forebulge) which indicate a thrust-dominated regime within the wedge and strike-slip or normal faulting regime, respectively, within the Foreland Molasse (Schrader, 1988).\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nOverpressure, vertical stress, compaction and horizontal loading along the North Alpine Thrust Front (NATF) have been investigated using drilling and velocity data of 20 wells and previously published interpreted seismic cross-sections.\nIn general, compaction increases towards and behind the NATF, which results in significant differences of vertical stress magnitudes in front and behind the NATF.\nOverpressure is increasing from West to East in front of the wedge and decreases from West to East in the wedge. Below the wedge, overpressure is always present and close to lithostatic stress. Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates (Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic), which provide a prolific deep geothermal reservoir in the NAFB and are normally sub-hydrostatically pressured in front of the wedge, can also be overpressured towards and below the wedge, indicating a loss of hydraulic connectivity with increasing depth and vertical effective stress. The onset of overpressure in Mesozoic Passive Margin Carbonates could therefore be a useful indicator for poor reservoir quality and an increased exploration risk, as underpinned by recently failed deep geothermal projects close to the wedge.\nThe general loading pattern along the NATF matches loading patterns of other onshore fold-and-thrust-belt systems and offshore accretionary prisms: Vertical loading controls compaction and overpressure formation in front and below the wedge. In front of the wedge, vertical loading is most likely related to basin subsidence and sedimentation, whereas below the wedge, vertical loading is mainly due to rapid overthrusting. Overpressure within the wedge is generated syntectonically by horizontal loading within duplex thrusts and eventually uplift\/erosion in imbricates in the western part of the study area, while in the eastern part of the study area, overpressure has either never built up in isolated imbricates of the wedge or dissipated during uplift\/erosion. The lateral transition from horizontal loading conditions within the wedge to vertical loading conditions in front of the wedge likely only comprises a few kilometers (<10\u00a0km) and probably coincides with the extent of the Tilted Molasse.\nIn addition to an improved regional understanding of the NATF, and the implications for local deep geothermal exploration, the results of our study also provide a unique reference case for overpressure development in onshore fold-and-thrust-belts and are of relevance to specialists working in the fields of geomechanics, structural geology and geodynamics.\n\n\nData availability\nAny raw data used and not disclosed in this study is available upon request from the Bavarian Environmental Agency (Bayerisches Landesamt f\u00fcr Umwelt, Referat Tiefengeologie & Untergrundpotenziale) and the data owners.

The key aim of this study is to define the stratigraphy of the Sohar Basin, place it into a tectonostratigraphic framework, and unravel its tectonic history. With this renewed understanding we can now evaluate the northern Sohar Basin's true hydrocarbon prospectivity. The Sohar Basin covers an area of approximately 30,000\u00a0km2 to the east of the Arabian Peninsula. It spans from the Musandam Peninsula of Oman, through the UAE's waters and south into the Oman Sea (Fig. 1\n).\nThe Sohar Basin is located on the northeastern margin of the Arabian Plate, to the east of the Oman Mountains. The basin formed in the Late Cretaceous after the closing of the Tethys Ocean, subsequent obduction of the Semail Ophiolite, and eventual collapse along the mountain belt's eastern margin (Styles et al., 2006, Ravaut et al., 1997; Levell et al., 2021).\nThe basin is located close to the confluence of three major fold and thrust belts, the Oman Mountains to the south and west, the Makran Accretionary Wedge to the east and the Zagros Fold Belt to the north and west (Fig. 1). The Sohar Basin is bound to the south by the Semail Gap in Oman and to the north and west by a basin bounding extensional fault (Ravaut et al., 1998; Levell et al., 2021, Fig. 1). To the northeast of the Sohar Basin, the Zendan-Minab strike-slip fault system (Jahani et al., 2009) runs from north to south marking the southeastern extremity of the Miocene to Pliocene aged Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt (Stoecklin, 1968; Alavi, 1994; Sherkati and Letouzey, 2004) and the western limit of the Makran accretionary prism (Mokhtari et al., 2008). To the west of the Sohar Basin, the Semail Ophiolite forms the spine of present-day Oman Mountains (Glennie, 1974).\n\n\n2\nRegional geology and tectonics\nFrom Mid-Permian to Lower Cretaceous times, the Arabian plate remained at equatorial latitudes allowing for the development of a passive margin (Pilia et al., 2021). At this time the Sohar Basin was not initiated since the in-situ Gulf of Oman Oceanic crust underlies the sedimentary pile that is approximately 80\u2013100Ma. This is inferred from age dating from the Semail Ophiolite onshore as being ca. 95 Ma (Tilton et al., 1981; Tippit et al., 1981) as well as heat flow measurements to the North and East of Ras al Hadd suggesting an age of 70\u2013100\u00a0Ma (White and Ross, 1979; Hutchison et al., 1981, Fig. 1).\nThe Arabian Plate has gradually drifted to the north from equatorial latitudes to its present day position since the Mid Cretaceous (Scotese, 2016, Fig. 2\n) forming a convergent plate boundary at its northeastern margin which lasted from 95 to 75Ma (Glennie et al., 1973; Ali et al., 2013; Searle and Cox, 1999). This led to the formation of two distinct basins on either side of the Oman Mountains, the Suneinah (Aruma) Foreland Basin to the west (Fig. 3\n, Boote et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 2014), and the Sohar \u201cRetro-Foreland\u201d or \u201cHinterland\u201d Basin to the east (Levell et al., 2021; Naylor and Sinclair, 2008).\nThe Sohar basin formed due to the collapse of the Oman Mountains' eastern flank in the late Cretaceous (Styles et al., 2006), this is marked by the presence of an extensional fault along the Sohar Basin's western margin, very close to the present-day coastline of Oman (Levell et al., 2021) and up into the UAE. During this time eustatic seal level fluctuations governed sediment distribution within the basin.\nThis was followed by a period of tectonic quiescence during the Early Cenozoic to the west of the Oman Mountains. Intermittent compression occurred during the Eocene through to Oligo-Miocene when uplift culminated as a result of the opening of the Red Sea and Zagros Orogeny (Searle et al., 2014; Tarapoanca et al., 2010). Structural deformation began in the Sohar Basin during the Eocene, and in some cases major growth faults were inverted in the Miocene as reverse faults (Levell et al., 2021). This led to the formation of anticlinal ridges, defining the geometry of the northern Sohar Basin and the sediments which were deposited within it at this time. Tectonic quiescence from Middle Miocene to present day allowed for the formation of a eustatically controlled margin as well as a prograding delta system.\nThe total sedimentary pile in the Northern Sohar Basin ranges from 0.5 to 10\u00a0km thick and varies in age from Mid-Cretaceous through to the Holocene, whereas, to the south in Oman up to 9\u00a0km of Miocene to Cretaceous sediment has been interpreted from seismic reflection data (Levell et al., 2021). The stratigraphy in the Sohar Basin is predominantly clastic. The source provenance for much of the sediments preserved in the Sohar Basin was the obducted Semail Ophiolite or uplifted Musandam culmination (Levell et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nData availability and methodology\nThe Geophysical dataset consists of both 2D and 3D proprietary seismic, that covers almost the entire study area of 4400km2.. (Fig. 4\n). The two 3D seismic volumes cover a total of nearly 2600\u00a0km2, and were acquired in 2000 and 2012. Additionally six 2D surveys were acquired in the basin between 1974 and 2014 measuring a total of 2551 line kilometres. In particular, the integration of the two 3D surveys and the Multi-Channel Seismic and Wide-Angle reflection data acquired in 2014 (Ali et al., 2020; Pilia et al., 2015, 2020) was paramount in developing the basin framework used in this study.\nA total of three wells have been drilled within the study area to depths of between 3 and 5\u00a0km where biostratigraphy determined the presence of Holocene to Upper Cretaceous aged strata. These three wells also defined seismic to well ties and interpretation of this data indicates that all wells had targeted structural traps.\nTo create a sequence stratigraphic framework, five regional composite seismic sections were interpreted (Fig. 4). From these, the major sequence stratigraphic and kinematic boundaries were picked. This framework was then used to consistently interpret throughout all of the available 2D and 3D seismic in the area of interest. The interpretation was then integrated into a basin modelling study, which was utilised to understand the petroleum systems and prospectivity.\n\n\n4\nMethods\nSeismic interpretation and mapping was completed in the IHS\u2122 Kingdom (2020) software and depth modeling was done using Kingdom's Dynamic Depth Conversion tool. Furthermore, basin modeling was undertaken in Zetaware's Trinity and Genesis software packages and all figures for this publication were drafted in CorelDraw 2019.\n\n\n5\nStratigraphic interpretation\nA series of seismically defined tectono-megasequences were recognised and picked on five regional seismic profiles (Fig. 4). An interpretation of the seismic facies established a regional facies model based on globally accepted models for both carbonate depositional settings and the clastic shelf to slope model of passive continental margins (Steckler et al., 1993). Well data was used to aid in generating facies maps from Eocene to Holocene. Seismic onlap terminations, key unconformities, and tectonic mega-sequences were picked from 5 key regional composite seismic lines across the study area (Fig. 4). Where possible these megasequence boundaries have been tied to the Arabian Plate Sequence Stratigraphic Boundaries of Sharland et al. (2001), and for the shallower sequences to Al-Husseini (2013), to provide a plate scale context. A chronostratigraphic summary chart showing the lithological relationships and chronostratigraphic units is shown in Fig. 5\n\n.\nDeep marine sediments of Mid to Upper Cretaceous age overlie the Oceanic Crust basement (see Fig. 6). It is represented by a succession of deep marine siliceous rocks including shales and radiolarites with interbedded siltstones. This is followed by the deposition of calcareous mudstones equivalent to the Pabdeh formation in the foredeep to the west of the Oman Mountains deposited during the Paleocene to Middle Eocene (Glennie, 1974; Boote et al., 1990\nZiegler, 2001). These are referred to in this study as the \u201cPre-Tectonic units.\"\nIn the Mid Paleogene (Fig. 5), structural deformation ensued, likely in response to the Oman Mountains uplift and subsequent collapse (Styles et al., 2006), and mini sub-basins formed between anticlinal ridges (Fig. 7\n\n and Fig. 9\n). This enabled shallow marine environments to develop on top of structural highs and source rocks to deposit in the restricted depositional lows. These units are referred to as the Syn-Tectonic units and are seismically defined by clear onlap sequences within localised mini-basins bound by structural ridges (see Fig. 8).\nThis tectonic phase was followed by a period of tectonic quiescence and allowed the development of a deltaic system which prograded from west\/northwest to east\/southeast from the Lower Miocene through to the present day. This delta system is comprised purely of clastic sediments transported from the Oman Mountains and the Musandam Peninsula into the Sohar Basin. These units are referred to as the \u201cPost-Tectonic units\".\n\n\n6\nStructure of the northern Sohar Basin\nThe subsurface structure of the Northern Sohar Basin is influenced by both compressional and extensional deformation. The Mid-Eocene to Cretaceous stratigraphy within the pre-tectonic unit is dominated by compressional deformation where a series of eastward verging anticlines have formed in response to westerly dipping reverse faults (Figs. 7 and 9). These thrusts appear to be detaching within less competent shale units of the Lower Tertiary or within units of similar lithology in the Upper Cretaceous (Figs. 6 and 7).\nClear onlaps onto the structures date their uplift as mid to lower Miocene, with some features suggesting movement as early as the Middle Eocene. High amplitude features run along many synclinal axes within the study area (Fig. 9). Clear downlap geometries onto the top of these anomalies indicate deep marine deposits and are likely to be basin floor fans. The anticlines formed basin floor ridges and minibasins during the Eocene to Lower Miocene and determined sediment distribution within the basin at this time (Fig. 9).\nThroughout much of the northern region of the Sohar Basin the Syn and Post Tectonic sections are un-deformed and simply infill or drape over these anticlinal structures (Figs. 8 and 9). Conversely, towards the south of the study area these Syn and Post Tectonic Units are cut by major extensional faults, which in some cases reach to the seafloor and are active at the present day (Fig. 10\n).\n\n\n7\nTectonostratigraphic evolution of the Sohar Basin\nA detailed tectonostratigraphic evolution model for the Sohar Basin is outlined below and is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nIn the Upper Cretaceous, a subduction zone formed and the Neo-Tethys oceanic crust was obducted onto the Arabian Plate's eastern-most continental margin (Glennie et al., 1973). To the west of the mountain belt the Suneinah (Aruma) Basin formed (Boote et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 2014), marked by the onset of clastic deposition into the foreland basin, with shallow marine carbonates being deposited directly onto the uplifted Semail Ophiolite, known as the Simsima formation (Noweir et al., 1998). In the Northern part of the Sohar Basin, similar shallow marine reef deposits were not encountered in the drilled wells but can be expected close to the mountain belt and shoreline.\nDuring the earliest Tertiary, these shallow marine carbonates were deposited close to the shoreline to the South in Oman and are known as the Seeb Limestone (Levell et al., 2021). To the west of the Oman Mountains, the Pabdeh foreland basin began to form. Deep marine shales were deposited in the foredeep and shallow marine carbonates were deposited along the shoreline (Searle, 2019). Today these are known as the Dammam and Umm-er-Radhuma formations (Noweir et al., 1998, Van Dijk, 2020). Within the Sohar Basin, similar strata can be expected within the deep basin, as proven by the drilled wells, and shallow marine facies would have been deposited along the western margin. This depositional setting persisted until the Middle Eocene when deformation commenced marking the end of the Pre-Tectonic phase.\nThe Mid Eocene to Oligocene period began with the onset of tectonic activity within the Sohar Basin. Thrust cored anticlines (Fig. 7) are likely associated with extension at the basin's western margin. This is concurrent with the major phase of deformation to the west of the Oman Mountains (Searle, 2019). This study interprets that the uplift of the Oman Mountains in the late Cretaceous was followed by \u2018post orogenic collapse\u2019, resulting in extension, and gravity-driven toe thrusting in the Sohar Basin.\nUplift along these ridges led to the development of narrow, deep, and isolated sub-basins within the synclines, as well as secluded shallow marine environments developing on the crests of the anticlines. This would have provided both the optimum conditions for preserving organic-rich source rocks in the lows and the growth of pinnacle and fringing reefs along anticlinal ridges forming barrier islands.\nA significant marine regression occurred during the Lower Miocene and the crests of these anticlines became exposed as isolated islands away from the shoreline (Fig. 10). Fringing reefs would likely have formed around the islands' shorelines with associated talus slopes leading into the restricted narrow basins. Sediment shed from the anticline crests was re-deposited as debris flows and flanks and via basin floor fans along north\/south synclinal axes. Towards the coastline, reefs were able to grow due to the limited clastic influx from the hinterland. This phase defined the beginning of the post tectonic stage which is denoted by tectonic quiescence and the formation of the eustatically controlled delta system that persists to the present day.\nDuring the Mid Miocene to Lower Pliocene, a marine transgression occurred and the coastline back-stepped towards the outcropping Semail Ophiolite. There was a significant change in sedimentation in the Sohar Basin as the carbonate factory switched off and clastic sedimentation dominated. As sea level gradually rose, the delta sequences prograded into the basin indicating that sediment supply was more significant than the creation of accommodation space. The sediment deposited in the shelf areas consisted of sands and silts derived from the ophiolite with abundant clasts of mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, as discovered in the drilled wellbores. The anticlines that were uplifted in Lower Tertiary were buried by deep marine pelagics and frequent turbidity flows. This meant that the anticlines uplifted in the previous tectonic stage were still forming bathymetric ridges on the basin floor. During episodes of eustatic low-stand, deep marine basin floor fans were preferentially deposited along the synclinal axes in a north-south orientation. In the earlier stages of the Mid Miocene these turbidites were confined within the mini-basins forming ponded, stacked fans and great thicknesses of reservoir sands are likely preserved.\nFrom the Lower Pliocene to the Pleistocene, the relative sea-level continued to rise. However, terrigenous influx exceeded the accommodation space resulting in shelf edge progradation. As a result of eustatic sea-level change, canyon systems dominated the shelf edge, and deep incisions can be seen from the 3D seismic as sediment was flushed into the deeper part of the basin to the southeast during lowstands. Shallow marine channels would have run across the shelf during periods of highstand and, in the event of episodic shelf flooding, it is possible that coals and organic beds were preserved. A sea-level drop in the Pleistocene to Holocene led to the denudation of the shoreline, and further progradation of the shelf edge. Clastic influx into the basin continued, and all sedimentary facies belts stepped further into the basin.\nFurther extensional deformation within the Sohar Basin occurred during the Miocene to Holocene (Fig. 11\n). This process is likely gravity-driven and occurred in response to differential loading between the shelf, shelf edge, and the depo-centres of the deltaic system. In the north towards the Oman border and into the Musandam, the subsurface is almost devoid of extensional faulting and comprises only compressional deformation. In the south towards the Oman border, regional-scale extensional features cross-cut all stratigraphic units leaving an overall extensional overprint on the pre-existing compressional architecture. This continues to the south into Oman as demonstrated by Levell et al. (2021) as well as Lawati et al. (2004), (Fig. 16), and discussed by Calvache and Holland (2001), where this same delta system develops into a 60\u00a0km long, seismically imaged gravity-driven slide in Omani waters (Levell et al., 2021).\n\n\n8\nProspectivity and play types\nFollowing an assessment of the wells drilled within the Sohar Basin and integration of the sequence stratigraphic interpretation, a series of prospective plays have been recognised and are summarised in Fig. 12\n. The prospective play types range in age from Eocene to Holocene, many of which contain structural and stratigraphic elements. Potentially the most prospective play within the basin is the Lower Miocene Basin Floor Fan Play. These fans were deposited as sediment was flushed down the synclinal axes of the basin which formed during the Eocene-Oligocene compressional event. The reservoirs directly overlie source rocks deposited within restricted mini-basins, and are sealed by fine-grained pelagic material deposited as a result of high energy turbidity flows. Basin modelling indicates that as the delta system developed these source rocks were buried to sufficient depths enabling hydrocarbons' maturation.\n\n\n9\nSource rock and petroleum systems modelling\nOne of the key risks to consider in the Northern Sohar Basin is the source rocks' presence, maturity, and effectiveness. As discussed earlier, the stratigraphic interpretation indicates a likelihood of a source rock within the deep, narrow mini-basins between the toe-thrust anticlines. To understand the petroleum system, a basin modelling study was undertaken using Zetaware's' Trinity and Genesis software integrating the 2D and 3D seismic, biostratigraphic data, as well as the temperature and vitrinite reflectance data from two wells within the study area for thermal calibration.\nFurthermore, a consistent set of 1D models was built across the area of interest followed by a 3D basin modelling exercise. The results showed a substantial likelihood of an active petroleum system within the northern Sohar Basin, given that the source rock model is accurate, despite the Sohar Basin's position on cold oceanic crust.\n\n\n10\nSource presence and concept\nThere are positive indications for a working petroleum system in the Sohar Basin. This is supported by the fact that hydrocarbon (oil and gas) shows were reported within 6 out of the 9 wells drilled. However, in all of the drilled wells, especially in the Northern Sohar Basin, no rock of good petroleum source quality has been penetrated. A renewed understanding of the Sohar basin using a sequence stratigraphic approach and an assessment of global analogues suggests that organically enriched facies may lie within the \u201cpiggyback mini-basins.\u201d This has been noted nearby in the Makran Accretionary Wedge (MAW) where the present day structural setting is akin to the Syn-Tectonic unit in this study (the proposed source rock model). The organic-rich shales that piston cored have recovered from these analogue mini-basins are testament to this as a viable conceptual model (Bourget et al., 2010, Lahijani et al., 2019; & Schulte et al., 2000).\nIt is also likely that source rock facies of varying quality is present within the pre-tectonic unit. This unit is equivalent to the Eocene-Paleocene of the Pabdeh Group where it is known to have sufficient source quality in Iran and the Foreland basin to the west of the Oman Mountains (Bordenave and Burwood, 1990, Alizadeh et al., 2020). Additionally, within the Fujairah 2 well that penetrated this section in the Northern Sohar Basin, some layers of source quality were found after geochemical analysis. The thickness of the unit (>1\u00a0km) could compensate for the lack of world-class source quality in the basin and so this unit should be considered as a potential source rock.\n\n\n11\nBurial history and maturity modelling\nBurial history plots were created across the basin to visualise the maturation of source rocks through time. Fig. 13\n displays an example burial history curve for a pseudo well generated in the deepest part of the eastern mini-basin where a source rock is predicted to exist. Pre-Tectonic source rocks would begin to mature in the Miocene when the mini-basins formed. Furthermore, potential source rocks in the lower part of the Syn-Tectonic package would commence the generation of hydrocarbons in the latter part of the Miocene or Pliocene. This occurred as accommodation space was created due to subsidence and sediments were flushed into the basin, burying the source rocks to sufficient depth. Within this deep mini-basin in the east the highest maturities are expected to be attained.\nAs shown in present-day maturity maps, the main or peak oil expulsion window is being reached in the lower part of the syn-tectonic unit (Fig. 14\n) and the condensate or wet gas window is being reached at mid pre-tectonic stratigraphic levels (Fig. 15\n). In the syn-tectonic case (Fig. 14) the oil maturities are attained within the two major mini-basins with smaller isolated zones reaching early oil maturity. Whereas in the pre-tectonic case (Fig. 15), every mapped mini-basin is mature for peak oil generation up to wet gas\/condensate generation. This demonstrates that source rocks can attain sufficient maturities to generate and expel hydrocarbons despite being situated on cold oceanic crust.\n\n\n12\nDiscussion\n\nStyles et al. (2006) suggested that extension in the Sohar basin began as early as the Late Campanian during the late stages of the Aruma Basin's development. It is also understood that the toe-thrusts in this part of the Sohar Basin are directly related to this extensional event. Regional-scale seismic interpretation has identified syn-tectonic mini-basins which display seismic onlaps onto structural highs that thin at the edges and thicken into the centre. Biostratigraphic data from the drilled wells within the Northern Sohar Basin suggest that these syn-tectonic packages are of Mid-Eocene to Lower Miocene age. This consequently indicates that if the thrusting and extension along the basin's margin are intrinsically related, this extensional event is of Mid-Eocene to Lower Miocene age.\n\nLawati et al. (2004) as well as Calvache and Holland (2001) suggested that the toe-thrust system is related to the growth faulting along the continental margin in response to sediment loading in the Upper Tertiary (Fig. 16\n). This study suggests that the toe-thrust system is of Eocene-Lower Miocene age and that the extensional system is a more recent feature, which has led to the overall overprint of extensional deformation in the south of the study area. This study has incorporated seismic data (2D & 3D) that extends to the north towards the Musandam, away from the Neogene deltaic depo-centre where the toe-thrust system is still prominent. This indicates that the two tectonic events are decoupled, therefore, a two-stage tectonic history consisting of compression and later extension may now perhaps be more plausible.\nRegarding tectonic history and structural timing, Levell et al. (2021) suggested that one of the major anticlines in the basin (the Damanyat Anticline in the offshore Oman Sea) resulted from Eocene extension followed by a Miocene inversion. The results from this study, however, would suggest that the thrusting occurred first during the Eocene to Oligocene and extension occurred after this in two separate gravity-driven structural episodes. An integrated study running from the Northern Sohar Basin in the UAE's waters down into the Oman sector of the basin in the south would be required to fully understand the drivers behind the structural deformation and ultimate tectonostratigraphic history.\n\n\n13\nConclusion\nThe interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic in both a kinematic and a sequence stratigraphic framework has greatly enhanced the understanding of the Sohar Basin concerning facies distribution and basin fill. This has led to a new tectonostratigraphic model being proposed for the Northern Sohar Basin comprised of Pre-, Syn- and Post-Tectonic units.\nThe Sohar Basin remains prospective for hydrocarbon exploration, where the most attractive stratigraphic traps lie within the undrilled Basin-Floor-Fan Play. The integration of structural geology and sequence stratigraphic principles has been paramount to understanding the geological history of the basin and has unveiled previously un-mapped potential.\n\n","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFault-controlled basement highs in mature sedimentary rift basins have successfully been targeted in petroleum exploration in e. g the Cuu Long Basin, Vietnam (Areshev et al., 1992; Cuong and Warren, 2009), Qaidam Basin, China (Yang et al., 2020), Gulf of Suez Rift, Egypt (Salah and Alsharhan, 1998; Braathen et al., 2018) and Say'un Masila Basin, Yemen (Legrand et al., 2011; Murray and Montgomery, 2014). Recent discoveries in the North Sea, along the Rona Ridge, West of Shetland (Trice et al., 2019) and on the Utsira High, Norway (Riber et al., 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019; Lie et al., 2016; Fredin et al., 2017; R\u00f8nnevik et al., 2017; Lothe et al., 2018; Ottesen et al., 2022), have initiated the search for similar basement plays on the Norwegian and UK continental shelves (Trice et al., 2019).\nCrystalline basement reservoirs may exhibit a layered architecture comprising a fractured rock layer below a zone of regolith (Dewandel et al., 2006; Cuong and Warren, 2009; Lachassagne et al., 2011; Braathen et al., 2018; Novitsky et al., 2018). The reservoir potential of initially tight crystalline rocks is dependent on secondary processes creating porosity and permeability (Nelson et al., 2000; Gutmanis, 2009; Le Van Hung et al., 2009). Crystalline rock reservoirs are dual porosity systems (Abdelazim and Rahman, 2016). The capacity to store and transport fluids may be improved by a combination of tectonically induced fractures and joints (Sausse and Genter, 2005; Pacheco and Alenco\u00e3o, 2006; Rossi and Graham, 2010; Novitsky et al., 2018), and the creation of matrix pores through physico-chemical alteration processes (Vepraskas et al., 1996; Graham et al., 1997; Schild et al., 2001; Navarre-Sitchler et al., 2013, 2015; Santos et al., 2018).\nIn the fractured layer, matrix porosity is low (<1%) and permeable fractures are the preferential conduits for fluid flow (Boutt et al., 2010; Lachassagne et al., 2011; Braathen et al., 2018; Nara et al., 2011). In the overlying regolith, matrix porosity may increase upwards due to physico-chemical alteration that occurred in the near-surface environment (Wright, 1992; Velde and Meunier, 2008; Braathen et al., 2018).\nArenaceous weathering is a particularly effective weathering process that transforms solid crystalline rocks into highly porous and permeable material, composed of a network of interconnected microfractures. The low to intermediate grade of chemical alteration and minimal transfer of mass are features that set arenaceous weathering apart from weathering processes resulting in clay-rich material (argillaceous weathering) (\u015arodo\u0144, 1999; Begonha and Sequeira Braga, 2002; Sequeira Braga et al., 2002; Riber et al., 2017). The resulting product, arenaceous saprolite (also called grus\/growan\/ar\u00e8ne), is the result of in-situ anisovolumetric weathering of parent rock into a coarse-grained saprolite. The combined silt and clay content is typically <25%, clay content alone is <10% and the chemical index of alteration (CIA) is generally 60\u201370 (Sequeira Braga et al., 1990, 2002; Migo\u0144 and Thomas, 2002; Parizek and Girty, 2014).\nRecent studies have highlighted the importance of anisovolumetric weathering processes, and how porosity is created in such saprolites by dilation, forming a network of interconnected microfractures (e.g. Parizek and Girty, 2014; Hayes et al., 2019; Riebe et al., 2021). Arenaceous saprolites stand in contrast to their argillaceous counterparts, that retain the original rock volume and where porosity mainly forms as a result of mineral dissolution, clay precipitation and the transfer of mobile cations (Brimhall and Dietrich, 1987; Stolt and Baker, 1994; Soil Science Glossary Terms Committee, 2008).\nArenaceous saprolites are present across all climate zones, but are typically formed on coarse grained and weathering-prone lithologies in tectonic regimes characterised by rapid uplift and continuous removal of newly formed regolith, where tectonically induced fractures and increased relief promote easy ingress for water (Migo\u0144 and Lidmar-Bergstr\u00f6m, 2001; Migo\u0144 and Thomas, 2002).\nDifficulties in collecting undisturbed samples of unconsolidated saprolites from drill cores (Cuong and Warren, 2009), and the fact that complete palaeoregolith profiles rarely are preserved in the rock record (Thiry et al., 1999; Migo\u0144 and Thomas, 2002), have initiated the search for adequate outcrop analogues to examine the formation of pores at each weathering stage. In this study, we have investigated the weathering of granodioritic rocks under a Mediterranean type of climate in the Sila Massif, Calabria region of southern Italy (Fig. 1\n).\nIn a previous study in the same location, Perri et al. (2015) described and reconstructed the weathering processes by mineralogy, chemistry and reaction path modelling. Therefore, the present paper focuses on describing and quantifying pore formation in relation to the physico-chemical processes at different stages in the arenaceous weathering of granodiorites in the Sila Massif. The pore-forming mechanisms were studied by combining multiple parameters such as physical properties (density), proportions of individual mineral alteration, changes in composition, amount of secondary material formed and the flux of mobile elements.\nThis study aims to increase our understanding of how microfractures form in the near-surface environment and the importance of microfractures for fluid flow and storage capacities in crystalline rocks. In addition to having the potential of being unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, fractured and weathered crystalline rocks may form important aquifers in areas where access to clean drinking water is otherwise limited (e.g. Jones, 1985; Acworth, 1987; George, 1992; Wright, 1992; Chilton and Foster, 1995; Foster, 2012). However, incomplete understanding of the hydraulic conductivity of such systems may result in the misplacement of wells or reduced yields (Lachassagne et al., 2021; Njueya et al., 2022). Moreover, as the exploitation of geothermal energy, in the absence of volcano-derived hydrothermal activity and high heat flow, is expanding worldwide, plutonic provinces and permeable geothermal reservoirs in granitic plutons studies, have led to a breakthrough in the field of geothermal resources (e.g. Ebigbo et al., 2016; Farquharson et al., 2020; Klee et al., 2021). Specifically, fractured granites, provide space and pathways for the storage and migration of geothermal fluids (e.g. Zheng et al., 2021).\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe study sites are located in the Sila Massif (Calabria, southern Italy) (Fig. 1) that falls within the Calabrian Arc on the broad collisional boundary between the European and African tectonic plates (Faccenna et al., 2001). The Calabrian Arc (Amodio-Morelli et al., 1976), part of the Mediterranean orogenic belt, represents an accretionary wedge consisting of Alpine units made up of ophiolite-bearing tectonic segments and of overlying basement nappes (Tansi et al., 2016 and references therein). The Calabrian microplate rifted off the southern margin of the European plate and drifted southeastward, overthrusting the northern margin of the African plate during the Neogene (Critelli and Le Pera, 1998; Van Dijk et al., 2000). The subduction zone of the Calabrian Arc is a turning point along the roughly E-W Eurasian-African plate boundary in the Central Mediterranean (Maesano et al., 2017). Following the latest deformation phase, a late Pleistocene to recent destabilisation episode has resulted in the area being highly active, seismically and volcanically (Van Dijk and Scheepers, 1995). The Calabrian Arc is composed of three structural sectors: the Sila, Serre and Aspromonte massifs (Amodio-Morelli et al., 1976) (Fig. 1A).\nThe Sila Massif is a batholith within the northern sector of the Calabrian Arc (Fig. 1B). The Sila Massif has experienced rapid uplift of 0.8\u20131.1\u00a0mm\/y since the Quaternary (Westaway, 1993). The metamorphic and plutonic terranes of the Sila Massif consist of Palaeozoic intrusive and metamorphic rocks, locally with a Mesozoic unmetamorphosed cover (Amodio-Morelli et al., 1976; Messina et al., 1991) (Fig. 1B). The plutonic rocks of the Sila Massif, ranging in composition from granodiorite to gabbro and leucomonzogranite, crop out over about 900\u00a0km2. Fission track analysis has revealed the main period of exhumation was between \u223c35 and \u223c15\u00a0Ma (Thompson, 1994). From a morphological perspective the Sila Massif is characterised by highlands consisting of paleosurfaces, ranging in height from about 1000 to 1700\u00a0m a.s.l. and gently rolling hills strongly controlled by WNW-ESE and NE-SW trending joints and faults. This landscape is dissected by deep incisions and bordered by steep slopes, where there is evidence of widespread erosion and mass wasting. In some places, especially on the residual paleosurfaces where the regolith has been removed, subspherical corestones and boulders of unweathered or less weathered rock crop out (Scarciglia et al., 2005, 2007).\nWeathering in the Sila Massif have probably developed under Mediterranean climate during Pleistocene (Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000). Weathering of crystalline rocks in the Calabria region have resulted in the transformation of fresh bedrock to arenaceous saprolites (Mongelli et al., 1998; Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Le Pera et al., 2001; Scarciglia et al., 2005; Borrelli et al., 2012; Perri et al., 2016; Biondino et al., 2020). Depending on the degree of erosion, the depth of surviving weathering profiles ranges from 1 up to 100\u00a0m (Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Scarciglia et al., 2005).\nWeathering of felsic igneous rocks (tonalites, granodiorites, granites) results is a mantle of unconsolidated regolith in which sand is the main grain-size fraction, on both the Sila (e.g. Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000) and Serre massifs (e.g. Moresi, 1987) (Fig. 1A).\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\n\n3.1\nStudy sites and macromorphology\nThe study sites (Figs. 1 and 2\nA) are in an abandoned quarry where weathered granodiorite of the Sila Massif crops out in a >35\u00a0m thick regolith profile (Fig. 2B). The degree of weathering was determined using a visual scale from W1 \u2013 W5 reflecting changes in colour, texture, hardness or shape with increased weathering (Stoops et al., 1979), as observed in the field. Based on the degree of weathering, the regolith profile was subsequently divided into three distinct weathering facies (altered coherent rock (ACR), saprock, and (lower and upper) saprolite facies) (Meunier et al., 1983; Velde and Meunier, 2008; Stoops et al., 2010; Riber et al., 2017) in addition to the superjacent soil horizons (Fig. 2C).\n\n\n3.2\nSampling\nTwenty-five conventional rock samples, representing distinct weathering facies and soil horizons, were collected. Selected samples were picked out for petrographical, mineralogical and geochemical analyses (Fig. 2C). In addition, four undisturbed samples of saprolite and soil material were obtained, from corresponding levels, with push corer equipped with stainless steel soil sample rings (https:\/\/eijkelkamp.com, product code 07.01.53. NN) in order to acquire accurate density measurements (Table 1\n) and produce thin sections with preserved fabric from the incoherent saprolite and soil intervals (Fig. 2C).\n\n\n3.3\nPetrography\nEleven polished thin sections, impregnated with blue epoxy to highlight pore space, were prepared and analysed at the Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo, using a Nikon Labophot-Pol polarizing optical microscope, equipped with PELCON automatic point counter. Dependent on the area of the thin section, 300\u2013400 points were counted for each slide (Table 2\n).\n\n3.3.1\nSingle minerals and degree of alteration and pores\nEvery mineral phase beneath the crosshairs was counted according to categories in Table 2 and then assigned to a degree of alteration following the guidelines by Stoops et al. (1979) (Fig. 6\n\n\n\n). These give five classes of alteration, based on the amount of transformation to secondary material attributable to weathering: fresh-nearly fresh (<2.5% transformed to secondary material), slightly altered (2.5\u201325% transformed), moderately altered (25\u201375% transformed), strongly altered (75\u201397.5% transformed), and completely altered (>97.5% transformed).\nIn this relation, it should be mentioned that chloritised biotite might be a product of late-stage weathering (Stoch and Sikora, 1976), but most authors consider biotite chloritisation and also sericitiation of plagioclase to have a metasomatic origin (Parneix et al., 1985; James et al., 1981; Que and Allen, 1996; Wilamowski, 2002; Stoops et al., 2010). Therefore, the products of these two processes were not included within the secondary weathering materials in this study.\nFine-grained material in the form of infillings of FeOx and clay coatings were counted individually. In samples from the soil horizons, fragments of organic material, soil aggregates and rounded rock fragments were counted as separate categories (Table 2).\nHigh-magnification images for micromorphological interpretation and chemical composition were obtained from selected samples on a Hitachi SU5000 FE-SEM (Schottky FEG) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a Dual Bruker XFlash30 Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) system at the Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo.\n\n\n3.3.2\nPorosity\nEvery counted void was either classified as pores, caused by the partial dissolution of the parent mineral, or as microfractures (elongated pores). The latter occurred in three varieties: intramineral (within a mineral grain), transmineral (cutting across two or more mineral grains, not following grains boundaries), or intermineral (following grain contacts) (Bisdom, 1967; Delvigne, 1998; Mazurier et al., 2016) (Table 2). Furthermore, pores were categorised either as open, including those coated by veneers of clay along the fracture wall, or as closed by neoformed or transported products (Stoops et al., 1979) (Table 2).\n\n\n3.3.3\nCrystal interfaces\nThree thin sections were prepared at the Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, University of Calabria, from unsieved saprolite and soil samples (samples 3-5-17; 3-7-17; 3-8-17). The samples were subsampled using a splitter, washed with H2O2 to remove clay minerals and organic matter, air-dried and then impregnated with epoxy resin. Thin sections were then etched with hydrofluoric acid to allow identification of plagioclase feldspars (Bailey and Stevens, 1960). In addition, eight thin sections, prepared at the University of Oslo, were included in the study of crystal interfaces (Tables 3 and 4\n\n).\nFor the measurement procedure of interface types in Table 3, each thin section was moved, using a mechanical stage, counting the interface types for 100 grains. For every grain, the interface between isomineralic or anisomineralic crystals were identified and counted under the polarizing microscope (Table 4) (Heins, 1995; Le Pera and Morrone, 2020). The number of counted interfaces ranged from a minimum value of 148 (sample 3-8-17) to a maximum of 500 interfaces (samples 3-4-17, 3-3-17, 3-2-17) (Table 4).\nPetrographic data of analysed plutoniclastic detritus included compositional counts to determine interface type and frequency (Table 4) in order to characterise rate and style of comminution in relation to crystalline interfaces of plutoniclastic grains (e.g. Heins, 1993, 1995) in a modern arenaceous saprolite environment. The use of mineral interfaces, determined for plutoniclastic sand-sized rock fragments, has previously received attention as a method to infer the influence exerted by durability on the generation of siliciclastic sediments (e.g. Palomares and Arribas, 1993; Heins, 1995; Caracciolo et al., 2012; Weltje et al., 2018).\nIsomineralic interfaces are those between crystals of the same mineral such as Qz\/Qz (Quartz\/Quartz), Kfs\/Kfs (K-feldspar\/K-feldspar) and Pl\/Pl (Plagioclase\/Plagioclase) (Table 4). Anisomineralic interfaces are boundaries between crystals of different minerals. Anisomineralic interfaces can be either with strongly contrasting crystal structures (anisomineralic anisostructural) such as Qz\/Opq (Quartz\/Opaque) (Table 4), or with identical crystal structures (anisomineralic isostructural) such as Qz\/Pl or Qz\/Kfs (Table 4).\nThe petrographic analysis of thin sections was used to determine the nature of the crystal\/crystal interfaces (Table 4), crucial because the interface is the boundary where breakdown processes occur (e.g. Slatt and Eyles, 1981; Cather and Folk, 1991; Palomares and Arribas, 1993; Caracciolo et al., 2012; Weltje et al., 2018). The amount of interfaces also correlates strongly with the environmental parameters (climate and topography) of the weathering efficiency (Heins, 1993, 1995).\n\n\n\n3.4\nX-ray diffraction (XRD)\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for qualitative and semi-quantitative mineralogical analyses of whole-rock (25 samples) (Table 5\n) and clay (<2\u00a0\u03bcm) fractions (16 samples) (Table 6\n). At the Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo, whole rock samples were micronised using a McCrone XRD-mill. The powder specimens were then prepared with the front-loading procedure and analysed by counting for 1.25\u00a0s at steps of 0.031\u00b02\u03b8 from 2 to 65 \u00b02\u03b8, on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with LynxEye 1-dimensional position sensitive detector (PSD), using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (40\u00a0kV and 40\u00a0mA). Phase quantities were determined by Rietveld refinement (Rietveld, 1969) using PROFEX (v. 3.11.1) (Doebelin and Kleeberg, 2015). Clay samples were prepared by extracting the <2\u00a0\u03bcm fraction by gravity settling. Oriented aggregate mounts were prepared using the Millipore-filter transfer method (Moore and Reynolds, 1997) and analysed after four treatments: air-dried, treated with ethylene glycol vapour for 24\u00a0h, heated at 350\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, and heated at 550\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. The XRD data from the <2\u00a0\u03bcm fraction was recorded by counting for 0.3\u00a0s at steps of 0.01\u00b02\u03b8 from 2 to 35 \u00b02\u03b8. The degree of interstratification and relative abundances of clay minerals were interpreted using NewMod II (v. 2.0) (Mertens et al., 2016).\nThe interpretation of clay minerals followed the procedures in Moore and Reynolds (1997). Peaks around 10\u00a0\u00c5, that did not react to any treatments were identified as a mixture of illite and fine-grained mica (I\u00a0+\u00a0M) (Table 6, Fig. 12\n\n\n\n\n\n). Chlorite was identified by a basal series of diffraction peaks at 14.13\u00a0\u00c5 (001), 7.07\u00a0\u00c5 (002), 4.71\u00a0\u00c5 (003) and 3.53\u00a0\u00c5 (004) (Table 6, Fig. 12A). The last heat treatment of the sample (550\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h) caused an increase in intensity of the 001 reflection, whereas the 002, 003 and 004 reflections experienced reduced intensities (Fig. 12A). The presence of smectite was suggested if peaks in the 14\u00a0\u00c5 region shifted to higher d-spacings after ethylene glycol treatment (Fig. 12A). Kaolinite was identified by peaks at around 7.16\u00a0\u00c5 and 3.58\u00a0\u00c5 that were destroyed by the last heat treatment (Fig. 12B). The kaolinite peaks were broad and asymmetric towards higher d-spacings, and could be decomposed into two partly overlapping reflections at around 7.14\u00a0\u00c5 and 7.35\u00a0\u00c5, possibly indicating the presence of both an highly ordered and a poorly ordered kaolinite, or alternatively a dehydrated halloysite (Table 6, Fig. 12B) (Tan, 2014; Tan et al., 2017). Peaks in the 14\u00a0\u00c5 region that did not expand after glycolisation and subsequently collapsed to lower d-spacings after heat treatment, were compatible with vermiculite (Fig. 12B).\n\n\n3.5\nWhole rock geochemistry\nBulk chemical analyses of 17 samples by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) (Table 7\n) were carried out by Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Ontario, Canada), following analysis code WRA-XRF 4C (https:\/\/actlabs.com).\n\n3.5.1\nMass balance calculation\nThe geochemical results (Table 7) were assessed following a geochemical mass balance approach (Brimhall and Dietrich, 1987; Driese et al., 2000; Braun et al., 2009) expressed by the open-system mass fraction transport function (\u03c4j,w) (Eq. (1)). In mass balance calculations, one element is assumed immobile (subscript i) during weathering of the parent material (subscript p), and thus making it possible to evaluate the losses and gains of mobile elements (subscript j) compared to the immobile element (subscript i) in the weathered samples (subscript w) (Sheldon and Tabor, 2009). In the present study, the least altered sample from the altered coherent rock facies (sample 3-20-17B) demonstrated similar mineralogical and chemical composition as fresh sample in Perri et al. (2015), and was thus assumed to be representative of the parent material in the area. Al2O3 was used as the immobile index element (Nesbitt and Young, 1982).\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nj\n,\nw\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nC\n\nj\n,\nw\n\n\n\nC\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\nj\n,\np\n\n\n\nC\n\ni\n,\nw\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\u03c4j,w represents losses or gains of a mobile element in weathered sample, Cj,p is the chemical concentration of a mobile element in weight percent (wt%) in parent material, Cj,w is the chemical concentration (wt%) of a mobile element in weathered sample, Cj,p and Ci,w are the chemical concentrations (wt%) of immobile index element in parent and weathered material, respectively.\nThe bulk mass-transfer coefficient (\u03c4b,w) (Hayes et al., 2019) (Eq. (2)), is the sum of all losses and gains of individual elements and represents the overall mass change during weathering of the parent material. \u03c4b,w is expressed by comparing the concentration of the immobile element (Al2O3) in the parent material (C\n\ni,p\n) with the concentration of the immobile element in weathered materials (C\n\ni,w\n) by:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\nb\n,\nw\n\n\n=\n\n\nC\n\ni\n,\np\n\n\n\nC\n\ni\n,\nw\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2\nChemical index of alteration (CIA)\nThe chemical index of alteration (CIA) (Nesbitt and Young, 1982) estimates the chemical alteration of feldspar minerals and their hydration to clay minerals (Sheldon and Tabor, 2009), by measuring the fluxes of mobile base cations relative to Al2O3 using whole rock molar quantities and correcting for the presence of Ca-bearing phosphates (apatite) within the silicate fraction (McLennan, 1993).\n\n(3)\n\n\nC\nI\nA\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nA\n\nl\n2\n\n\nO\n3\n\n\n\nA\n\nl\n2\n\n\nO\n3\n\n+\nC\na\n\nO\n\u2217\n\n+\nN\n\na\n2\n\nO\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nC\na\n\nO\n\u2217\n\n=\nC\na\nO\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\n10\n3\n\n\u00d7\n\nP\n2\n\n\nO\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3\nBulk density (\u03c1b), calculated porosity (\u03c6c) and volumetric strain factor (\u03b5)\nBulk densities (\u03c1b) of undisturbed samples, collected by push corer, were estimated by measuring the dry weight of the sample while contained in the sample rings with known volume (100\u00a0cm3) (Table 1). Bulk densities (\u03c1b) of conventional samples from the altered coherent and saprock facies were determined by volume displacement.\nCalculated porosities of weathered samples (\u03c6c) can be computed by assuming that changes in bulk densities (\u03c1b) was the result of increasing porosity, whereas the grain density remained constant (Buss et al., 2017). The bulk density (\u03c1b,p) of parent material (sample 3-20-17B) was taken as representative of the coherent rock grain density. The calculated porosity of a weathered sample (\u03c6c,w) can then be estimated by the ratio of bulk density of weathered material (\u03c1b,w) with that of the parent material (\u03c1b,p), by\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\nc\n,\nw\n\n\n=\n100\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c1\n\nb\n,\nw\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\nb\n,\np\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volumetric changes of weathered samples (\u03b5) can be estimated by the relationship between the total mass loss (Eq.

LOI has been applied successfully as an indicator of the degree of weathering (e.g. Regassa et al., 2014), as the amount of OH groups increase during weathering when anhydrous silicates are replaced by hydrous clay minerals (Velde and Meunier, 2008). In addition LOI is an approximation of the amount of organic matter and volatiles.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nMacromorphology\nThe altered coherent rock facies (ACR) (Figs. 2 and 3A) was recognised in outcrops by its minor red staining within and close to fractures. This indicates exposure to meteoric waters and oxidation of iron-bearing minerals, as the only prominent weathering feature. Otherwise, the ACR facies appears coherent and retains mechanical strength, and is categorised as W2\u2013W3 on the degree of weathering scale.\nIn the overlying saprock facies (Fig. 3B) red staining is more pervasive, and the rock could easily be disaggregated with a hammer. The degree of weathering was estimated to be around W3\u2013W4 (Figs. 2 and 3B). The lower saprolite facies (Fig. 3C) is a transitional stage between the coherent saprock and the incoherent upper saprolite (Fig. 3D).\nRock samples from the lower saprolite are strongly oxidised and could be broken apart by hand, and the degree of weathering is classified as W4\u2013W5 (Figs. 2 and 3C). In the upper saprolite facies, the rock looses cohesion and could be dug out using only a spade, and degree of weathering is classified as W5 (Figs. 2 and 3D). A bleached horizon (Bw) (Figs. 2 and 3E) separates the upper saprolite from the upper dark brown, organic-rich soil A-horizon (Figs. 2 and 3F).\n\n\n4.2\nMicromorphology (petrography)\n\n4.2.1\nWeathering of individual grains\n\n4.2.1.1\nBiotite\nIn the altered coherent rock (ACR) and saprock facies, a majority of the observed biotite crystals had previously experienced partial-to-complete metasomatic chloritisation, as reflected in change of colour from shades of brown to pale green, under microscopic inspection in plane polarised light (PPL) (Fig. 4A and B). Additionally, the biotite crystals are speckled with minute inclusions of apatite, zircon and Ti-oxides, as identified in SEM (Fig. 5A).\nIt was estimated that about half of the observed biotite grains in the ACR facies had undergone 2\u201325% pseudomorphological transformation from brown and green to pale and white colours in PPL, whereas less than one third had experienced a transformation of 25\u201375% (Fig. 6). About 20% of the biotite grains were identified as fresh or nearly fresh. Liberation of structural Fe from slightly deformed biotite crystals resulted in the original mica grains acquiring a discoloured or bleached appearance (Fig. 4A and B). The low mobility of Fe is demonstrated by the precipitation of Fe-oxide-hydroxides in close proximity of the source mineral, i.e. between exfoliated biotite lamellae, in microfractures that had extended to neighbouring crystals subparallel to the mica cleavage, or as staining on adjacent mineral surfaces (Figs. 4B and 5B). In the saprock facies, more than three-quarters of the biotite grains are categorised as slightly altered (Fig. 6).\nIn the lower saprolite facies, there is a notable increase in the degree of biotite alteration. More than half the biotite grains are grouped as moderately altered, i.e. 25\u201375% of the viewed original grain is pseudomorphically transformed to a new mineralogical phase (Figs. 4C and 5C). Morphologically, most biotite grains at this level display deformation such as curling, buckling and expansion perpendicular to the c-axis (Figs. 4C and 5C, E).\nThe progressive pseudomorphic transformation of biotite increases upwards in the saprolite facies, culminating in the uppermost saprolite sample where >30% of the biotite grains are labelled as strongly altered, i.e. 75\u201397.5% of the original grain is transformed into a new mineral phase and only occasional grains remain unaltered (Fig. 6).\nIn the soil samples, only a few altered biotite grains were observed in the B-horizon, with more than half of the grains categorised as fresh \u2013 nearly fresh, and around 80% are classified as slightly altered in the A-horizon (Fig. 6).\n\n\n4.2.1.2\nPlagioclase\nIn the ACR and saprock facies, >95% of the observed plagioclase grains are categorised as fresh \u2013 nearly fresh (Fig. 6). However, the typical optical features of fresh plagioclase, such as polysynthetic twinning, are obscured by numerous minute inclusions of metasomatic sericite (Fig. 4A). In a few plagioclase grains an irregular speckled pattern of transformation has taken place along intramineral microfractures. Isolated intramineral pores are either open or occupied by clays with Mg-rich chemical composition that also include subordinate K and Ca, as revealed by their EDS spectra. Slight alteration has taken place along open transmineral microfractures that transect plagioclase grains, represented by neoformed material growing on the fracture wall. In addition, a dark brown material, identified as Fe-oxide-hydroxide by the EDS spectra, was observed, either as precipitates within transecting microfractures or along cleavage planes.\nIntensification of plagioclase alteration was observed in samples from the lower saprolite facies, where >30% of the grains are categorised as slightly altered, >30% as moderately altered and >20% as strongly altered (Fig. 6).\nPlagioclase alteration appears to increase upwards in the saprolite interval with the exception of one sample (3-11-17B) (Fig. 6). The plagioclase crystals are pseudomorphically replaced by secondary material (clays) where the original crystal outline is preserved and even original polysyntethic lamellae are vaguely visible, suggesting preferential replacement (Fig. 4E). In the uppermost saprolite sample, close to 70% of the observed plagioclase grains are categorised as strongly altered, i.e. between 75 and 97.5% of the grain replaced by clays, mainly kaolinite, as identified by booklet morphology in SEM and by the EDS spectra (Fig. 6).\nAs for the biotite, there is much greater variation in the degree of alteration displayed by grains in the soil samples, ranging from fresh \u2013 nearly fresh to completely altered, with the majority of grains being classified as slightly to moderately altered (Figs. 5F and 6).\n\n\n4.2.1.3\nK-feldspar (microcline and perthithic feldspar)\nVisible signs of chemical alteration of K-feldspar were not observed in the ACR and saprock facies (Fig. 4A). In the saprolite facies, minor alteration ha s taken place along the fracture walls of transmineral microfractures. Upwards in the saprolite facies, with increasing influence of microfracturing, K-feldspar grains are broken into smaller angular fragments (Fig. 4D), but still relatively unaffected by chemical alteration (Fig. 6). During fragmentation of the grains, displacement mainly occurs by dilation, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the fracture wall. Plagioclase inclusions within the microcline crystals are affected by alteration, albeit to a lesser degree than the individual plagioclase crystals in the sample.\n\n\n4.2.1.4\nQuartz\nQuartz was observed to be chemically unaltered, but the grains are transected by a few, short, closely spaced hair-like microfractures in the ACR facies, features that increase in frequency and aperture upwards (Fig. 4). In the advanced weathering stages, the original quartz grains are fragmented into smaller angular fragments, with displacement mainly occurring perpendicular to the fracture walls (dilation) (Fig. 4C, D, F).\n\n\n\n4.2.2\nPorosity\n\n4.2.2.1\nAltered coherent rock facies\nObserved pores (\u03c6 obs) make up <5% of the total area analysed in thin sections from the ACR facies, and include all three fracture categories (Figs. 7 and 8), the majority being categorised as closed fractures (Fig. 7). Microfractures were observed to traverse multiple grains, both as open pores or closed by Mg- and Fe-rich clays with a chemical composition revealed by EDS spectra (Figs. 4B and 5B). In some cases, transmineral pores were observed radiating from the tip of exfoliated biotite grains (Fig. 5B); they are completely or partially infilled by dark brown material, with an EDS spectra indicating a material enriched with Fe or Ti. Isolated pores are present as intramineral microfractures that follow the cleavage planes in feldspars (Fig. 9A and B). Slight weathering had taken place along intramineral pores in plagioclase, and these are partly open or filled by clays with a composition including Mg, Fe and K (Fig. 9A). The few intermineral fractures at grain contacts are principally observed in connection with slightly altered plagioclase and biotite grains, being infilled by neoformed clays or Fe-oxide-hydroxide and Ti-oxides.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nSaprock facies\nSamples from the saprock facies display an increase in \u03c6 obs, compared to the ACR facies (Fig. 7), where the \u03c6obs at this level accounted for 7% of the bulk rock. In contrast to the ACR facies, the majority of pores are open (Fig. 7). More than 60% of the \u03c6obs are interconnected microfractures transecting multiple grains that are also joined by open intermineral pores (Fig. 9B). The majority of fractures are classified as open or partially open, with fracture walls covered by a thin veneer of clays (Figs. 4B, 5B and 9C, D). Microfractures that transect plagioclase are partially to completely occluded by clays.\n\n\n4.2.2.3\nLower saprolite facies\nThrough the transition to saprolite facies, \u03c6obs almost doubles compared to the saprock facies, and make up about 12% of the total rock (Fig. 7). Compared to the saprock samples, microfractures in the lower saprolite facies are more frequent and display enlarged apertures (Fig. 9E). A combination of different types of pores make up a dense network of interconnected microfractures that in some instances result in the breaking up of quartz and feldspar grains into smaller, angular fragments that have not experienced any notable chemical alteration (Figs. 5C and 9E, F). Several examples of opening of multiple wafers in a single biotite grain were observed (Figs. 4C and 5C, D). The microfractures with the largest apertures are open, but coated by a film of dark brown, Fe-rich material on the fracture walls. The microfractures with smaller apertures are generally open, except within the altered plagioclase grains, where most pores are infilled by clays (Fig. 9E and F).\n\n\n4.2.2.4\nUpper saprolite facies\nWith increasing alteration of plagioclase grains in the saprolite facies, intramineral pores were more frequently observed (Figs. 8 and 9G, H). In SEM, the intramineral pores were observed to be either open or filled by kaolinite clays, identified by the booklet morphology and EDS spectra. The breakage of single feldspar and quartz grains combined with an increase in open intermineral fractures and intramineral pores in plagioclase, reduce the grain size of the saprolite compared to the ACR and saprock weathering facies. In the saprolite texture, individual crystals or crystal fragments are separated by a network of either open and coated or partly infilled interconnected pores (Fig. 9G and H).\nIn an undisturbed sample (3-4UD-17B) from 90\u00a0cm below the reference level, microlaminated clay coatings with crescent morphology were observed as infillings. At this level, intramineral pores in strongly altered plagioclase grains are the dominating pore type. The intermineral space is partly infilled by mixed material made up of fine-grained angular fragments of primary minerals and soil aggregates floating in a matrix of kaolinite (Fig. 5F). The intermineral mixed material is cut by channels coated by material that were deposited parallel to the fracture wall. In the uppermost saprolite sample (3-3UD-17B), total pores that were distinguishable under the microscope make up about 25% of the thin section, and more than half of these pores are classified as open. The texture is similar to that in 3-4UD-17B, but with increased number and width of fractures and increased portion of intramineral pores, all as a result of plagioclase weathering (Figs. 4E and 5F, G and 9G, H). The original rock texture is still essentially reproducible, since the disaggregated grains are mainly transposed perpendicular to the fracture walls without rotation or significant displacive movement parallel to the fracture.\n\n\n4.2.2.5\nSoil\nThe samples from the soil horizons consist of a mixture of rock fragments, single mineral grains, soil aggregates and organic material, separated by intermineral pores. The original rock texture is no longer preserved. Rock fragments display variable degree of weathering, including plagioclase grains ranging in weathering degree from fresh\u2013nearly fresh to strongly altered. The rock fragments are subangular, and grooves on the surface of the fragments are coated by dark brown soil material (Fig. 4F). When moving from the Bw to the A soil horizon there is a reduction in the rock clast to soil aggregate ratio, and a slight increase in intermineral pores (Fig. 8).\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nCrystal interfaces\nThe proportion of overall interfaces is evenly distributed in the altered coherent rock and lower saprolite facies. The reduction of total interfaces observed in the more advanced weathering stages, i.e. from upper saprolite facies and upwards, indicates splitting of previously interlocking interfaces.\n\n4.2.3.1\nIsomineralic interfaces\nFive isomineralic interface types were identified. Their relative mechanical durability, from most to least durable, can be summarised as follows: Qz\/Qz\u00a0>\u00a0Kfs\/Kfs\u00a0>\u00a0Pl\/Pl\u00a0>\u00a0Bt\/Bt\u00a0>\u00a0Ms\/Ms (Table 4, Fig. 10A, B, C). Isomineralic interfaces involving a phyllosilicate crystal, such as biotite\/biotite (Bt\/Bt interface) and muscovite\/muscovite (Ms\/Ms interface), are very few, representing <1% of the counted interfaces (Table 4).\n\n\n4.2.3.2\nAnisomineralic isostructural interfaces\nBy comparing Qz\/Pl, Pl\/Kfs and Qz\/Kfs interfaces, the boundary between plagioclase and quartz (Qz\/Pl) appears to be more durable than the boundary between the plagioclase and adjacent alkali feldspars (Pl\/Kfs), whereas Qz\/Kfs interfaces are the least durable (Fig. 10D, E, F). Mixed tectosilicate interfaces, such as Qz\/Pl, Pl\/Kfs and Qz\/Kfs, are more durable than anisomineralic isostructural interfaces between phyllosilicates such as Bt\/Ms and Bt\/Chl (Table 4). A few inclusions of accessory minerals, such as zircon within plagioclase or muscovite, and epidote within plagioclase were counted as interfaces (Table 4).\n\n\n4.2.3.3\nAnisomineralic interfaces involving phyllosilicates\nIn the Sila grus samples it appeared that the durability of biotite is higher when it adjoined a quartz crystal than plagioclase, whereas the Kfs\/Bt contact displays a more ambiguous trend that was difficult to interpret (Fig. 10G, H, I). Other anisostructural interfaces involving phyllosilicates are muscovite-rich, such as Qz\/Ms, Pl\/Ms, Kfs\/Ms (Table 4). Qz\/Ms interfaces occurred in trace amounts in three arenaceous saprolite horizon depths and are lacking in the deepest; Pl\/Ms interfaces are more numerous in the upper saprolite interval (4%) and decrease to 0.4% in the deepest one; Kfs\/Ms interfaces have the same value in the first two summit saprolite horizons but are absent from the deepest (Table 4). Interfaces between chlorite and a tectosilicate such as Qz\/Chl and Pl\/Chl occur only in trace amounts and are lacking in the upper arenaceous saprolite horizons.\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nX-ray diffraction (XRD)\n\n4.3.1\nWhole rock XRD\nTwo-mica, medium-grained monzogranite-granodiorite characterises the Sila granite composition at this locality. The main constituents in the ACR facies are quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar (Table 5). Chloritised biotite dominates over muscovite in the mica association. The Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) ratio (Table 5, Fig. 11) is used as an indicator of chemical weathering, and shows that one sample from the saprock facies actually displays a higher ratio than the ACR facies, possibly reflecting variations in the primary composition, rather than alteration (Fig. 11). Compared to the saprock, the Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) ratio decreases markedly in the lower saprolite facies, and is further reduced in the upper saprolite facies (Table 5, Fig. 11). However, a slight increase in the Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) ratio was observed in the soil horizons, compared to the underlying saprolite.\nChlorite is the dominant clay-sized mineral in the ACR and saprock facies, and appears both as inherited, fine-grained micaous grains and as neoformed clays. The first appearance of kaolinite and vermiculite in whole rock samples was observed in the lower saprolite facies (Table 5, Fig. 11), but the total clay content never exceeds 10% of the total rock throughout the profile.\n\n\n4.3.2\nClay mineralogy XRD (<2\u00a0\u03bcm)\nIn sample from the ACR facies (3-20-17B), chlorite is the most abundant mineral, making up around 40% of the clay fraction, (Table 6, Fig. 12A). The dominant chlorite peaks at \u223c14\u00a0\u00c5 and \u223c7\u00a0\u00c5 partly obscure an overlapping mineral phase in air dried state that shifts to higher d-spacings after glycolisation, to 16.9\u00a0\u00c5 and 7.6\u00a0\u00c5 respectively (Fig. 12A). Peak positions for the expanding phase are not consistent with pure smectite, but is interpreted to represent a mixed-layered mineral, possibly chlorite-smectite (35%) (Table 6, Fig. 12A). Illite and\/or fine-grained mica (I\u00a0+\u00a0M) (25%) are represented by a reflection at 9.93\u00a0\u00c5 (Table 6, Fig. 12C).\nIn the saprock facies (sample 3-19-17B), the mixed-layered expanding phase (chlorite-smectite) is dominating (73%) over I\u00a0+\u00a0M (17%) and chlorite (11%), in the clay fraction (Table 6, Fig. 12C).\nThe sample that represents the transition from saprock to saprolite facies (3-15-17B) contains the first traces of kaolinite (4%). The clay fraction of the sample, however, is dominated by chlorite-smectite (68%) with subordinate I\u00a0+\u00a0M (22%), and vermiculite (6%) (Table 6, Fig. 12C).\nThe clay fraction of the seven saprolite samples are dominated by kaolinite (\u223c80%), with accessory I\u00a0+\u00a0M (15%) and vermiculite (\u223c5%) (Table 6, Fig. 12B and C). There are no obvious changes in the distribution of the individual clays upwards in the saprolite facies, however the highly ordered kaolinite polytype appears to increase stratigraphically upwards at the expense of poorly ordered polytype.\nClay mineralogy from the Bw soil horizon is similar to the underlying saprolite, being kaolinite dominated, with minor I\u00a0+\u00a0M and vermiculite (Fig. 12C). In the five samples from the A horizon, however, both I\u00a0+\u00a0M (20\u201330%) and vermiculite (10\u201320%) display a trend of increasing amounts upwards at the expense of kaolinite (70\u201355%) (Tables 6 and 1E, Fig. 12C). In addition, in the A horizon kaolinite is only represented by the ordered polytype, displaying peaks close to 7.15\u00a0\u00c5.\n\n\n\n4.4\nMass-balance relationships and volumetric changes\n\n4.4.1\nMass-transfer reconstruction for individual elements\nTranslocation of elements relative to the composition of the parent material (sample 3-20-17B), assuming immobile Al, reveals various trends of losses and gains in the regolith profile (Table 7, Fig. 13\n).\nThe concentration of the most abundant element, Si, displays relatively small variations throughout the regolith profile, implying only minimal loss and gains (Fig. 13A).\nFrom the protolith sample (3-20-17B) and up to the sample from the lower saprolite facies (3-15-17B), the Ca concentration experiences a reduction of >50% (Fig. 13E). At the onset of the upper saprolite facies, >80% of the initial Ca has been leached, and the concentration remains stable throughout the saprolite facies and soil B horizon. In the A horizon, a slight increase was observed compared to the underlying B horizon (Fig. 13).\nRelative variations of Na, compared to the composition of the protolith displays a comparable but less pronounced trend than the Ca variations (Fig. 13F). Na concentration is reduced by approximately 50% from the ACR to the saprolite facies, but with a slight increase in the soil horizons.\nRelative to the composition of the protolith, Mg concentrations experience a drop of about 50% in the saprock facies and are then relatively stable until a slight increase was observed in the soil horizons (Fig. 13D). The trend in Mg concentrations is almost mirrored by the upwards variations in Fe and P (Fig. 13B, H), with a net leaching in the weathered rock and soil Bw horizon, followed by an increase in the soil A horizon. K experiences a large relative gain from the ACR to the saprock facies (Fig. 13G). A progressive decrease in K was observed through the lower and upper saprolites and Bw horizon, until stabilising in the A horizon (Fig. 13). Mn experiences a reduction of about 50% in concentration in sample from saprock facies relative to the composition of the assumed protolith. The Mn concentrations remain stable through the saprolite and soil B horizon, but in the soil A horizon, a net gain of >30% is evident (Fig. 13C).\n\n\n4.4.2\nChemical index of alteration (CIA) and loss on ignition (LOI)\nCIA and LOI values both increase progressively upwards through the profile (Table 7, Fig. 14\nB and C). Possibly due to variations in the original composition, the saprock sample displays a lower CIA value (CIA\u00a0=\u00a054) than the sample from the ACR facies (CIA\u00a0=\u00a056). However, the LOI also displays a slight decrease in the saprock facies (Fig. 14C). A small increase in chemical alteration and LOI was observed in the lower saprolite facies compared to the saprock facies. In the upper saprolite facies the CIA and LOI possibly reflect two subsequent units of upwards increasing chemical weathering, almost attaining intermediate degrees of alteration. Intermediate degrees of chemical alteration (CIA>65) are reached in the soil horizons, with the highest recorded CIA being 65.5 (Fig. 14B). The LOI displays a greater relative increase than CIA in the organic-rich soils compared to the underlying units (Fig. 14C).\n\n\n4.4.3\nBulk density (\u03c1b), calculated porosity (\u03c6c,w), bulk mass transfer coefficient (\u03c4b), and volumetric strain factor (\u03b5)\nThe measured density (\u03c1\nb\n) diminishes from 2.66\u00a0g\/cm3 in the protolith to 2.47\u00a0g\/cm3 in the saprock facies. Furthermore, a gradual density reduction upwards is evident, from 1.66 to 1.88\u00a0g\/cm3 in three samples from the saprolite facies, to 1.61\u00a0g\/cm3 in the Bw horizon, and 1.15\u00a0g\/cm3 in the A-horizon (Fig. 14D).\nThe corresponding porosities (\u03c6c) (Eq. (5)) demonstrate values of around 7% in the sample from the saprock facies, increasing to 29\u201338% in the three samples from the saprolite facies, and to 39% (Bw horizon) and 57% (A-horizon) in the two soil samples (Fig. 14E, Tables 1 and 7).\nThe upwards tendency in total mass transfer (\u03c4b) is ambiguous (Table 7, Fig. 14) and indicates that weathering progressed with minimal net gain or loss of mass. The variations in \u03c4bulk mirror the most abundant elemental oxide, SiO2, and is not reflecting the increasing porosities (Figs. 12 and 13).\nThe positive and upwards increasing value of the volumetric strain factor (\u03b5) (Fig. 14F) implies that the creation of porosity was primarily the result of enlarged rock volume rather than removal of mass. The volumetric strain factor (\u03b5) indicates an increase in volume of >50% in the saprolite compared to the protolith, while a more than doubling of volume was calculated for the soil sample (Fig. 14F).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nHypogene alteration\nIn fresh \u2013 nearly fresh crystalline rocks, alteration advances slowly, with transportation of solutes mainly occurring by diffusion (Bazilevskaya et al., 2015) within thermally or mechanically induced intra- and intermineral micropores (<1% of total rock volume), that were formed by e. g thermal contraction during cooling, by tectonic stresses during stages of deformation, and by stress relaxation during unloading (Kranz, 1983; Schild et al., 2001; Graham et al., 2010). In this study such micropores were observed in the ACR facies. They occur both within quartz crystals and as microfractures following the primary cleavage direction in feldspars. Furthermore, a majority of pre-existing, hypogene microfractures and imperfections were likely healed and sealed by percolating fluids (Schild et al., 2001), but may have been reactivated in the early stages of weathering (Delvigne, 1998). This would have facilitated later infiltration of percolating groundwater (Bergbauer and Martel, 1999; Nelson, 2001; Cuong and Warren, 2009). After reaching the near-surface environment, the fracture tips in the previously formed microfractures may function as reaction sites for fluid\/rock interactions in a process of stress corrosion that provokes subcritical fracture propagation (Atkinson and Meredith, 1981; Eppes and Keanini, 2017; Anderson, 2019). Additional hypogene alteration includes the coupled process of replacement of plagioclase with sericite and the chloritisation of biotite, generally attributed to late magmatic metasomatism (Speer, 1984; Eggleton and Banfield, 1985; Que and Allen, 1996).\n\n\n5.2\nInitiation of weathering\nPhysico-chemical processes are initiated in the Critical Zone (Brantley et al., 2006) when the rock comes into contact with oxygen-rich fluids of meteoric origin (Fletcher et al., 2006), giving rise to:\n\n(1)\nThe transformation and dissolution of primary minerals (Banfield and Eggleton, 1990; Delvigne and Stoops, 1990; White, 1995; White et al., 1998; von Eynatten et al., 2003; Pacheco and Van der Weijden, 2012).\n\n\n(2)\nFormation of trans-, intra- and intermineral pores (Bisdom, 1967; Stoops et al., 1979; Vepraskas et al., 1996; Rossi and Graham, 2010; Bazilevskaya et al., 2015; Mazurier et al., 2016; Hayes et al., 2019).\n\n\n(3)\nPrecipitation of secondary products (Stoops and Delvigne, 1990; Meunier et al., 2007; B\u00e9tard et al., 2009).\n\n\n(4)\nThe removal or addition of elements and material (Brimhall and Dietrich, 1987; Middelburg et al., 1988; Driese et al., 2000; Braun et al., 2009).\n\n\n\nIn the ACR facies, the CIA value of 56 (Fig. 14) indicates a low degree of chemical alteration (Nesbitt and Young, 1989). Riber et al. (2017) considered the first visible signs of alteration in the ACR facies were the precipitation of ferric oxides along discontinuities, likely sourced from the oxidation of ferrous minerals. Oxidation of Fe (II) and subsequent release as Fe (III) during weathering of biotite has been suggested as an early alteration process in the Critical Zone (Buss et al., 2013; Bazilevskaya et al., 2015). This is the case in the ACR facies in the Sila granodiorites, where >80% of biotite grains are classified as altered, whereas most of the plagioclase (>95%) remain fresh \u2013 nearly fresh (Fig. 6). Biotite transformation can progress via intermediate vermiculite, causing expansion in the c-axis direction (Isherwood and Street, 1976; Rebertus et al., 1986; Banfield and Eggleton, 1988; Delvigne and Stoops, 1990; Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Fletcher et al., 2006; Scarciglia et al., 2007; Bazilevskaya et al., 2013; Parizek and Girty, 2014; Webb and Girty, 2016). In contrast, environments characterised by more aggressive chemical weathering may promote the direct transformation of biotite to kaolinite (Murphy et al., 1998) or even gibbsite (Sequeira Braga and Paquet, 1986). Stress induced by the volumetric increase of biotite crystals may create new sets of microfractures that possibly follow cleavage planes of surrounding grains or previously formed zones of weakness (Graham et al., 2010).\nDuring weathering of the Sila granodiorite the first authigenic clay mineral to form was probably the mixed-layered expanding phase (chlorite-smectite) (Fig. 12), which is in accordance with the reaction path model from the same profile (Perri et al., 2015) that predicted smectite (saponite) to be the first mineral to precipitate. The chlorite-smectite mineral is likely the result of incipient transformation of chloritised biotite (Senkayi et al., 1981) and\/or neoformed after the alteration of sericitised plagioclase (Taboada and Garcia, 1999) (Fig. 12). The pure chlorite and I\u00a0+\u00a0M, identified in the ACR samples, are believed to be inherited from the protoliths (Fig. 12).\nFrom a reservoir perspective, the rock matrix in the ACR facies is a material with poor hydraulic conductivity; the measured density of 2.66\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 14) is typical of granitoids with little to no formation of voids (Buss et al., 2008; Hayes et al., 2019), and with the total open pores observed to be less than 2% of the rock volume (Fig. 7). However, macrofractures that are larger than the scale of hand specimens (Fig. 2B) may have been sufficient for transportation and storage of fluids, as is the case in many basement-rock hydrocarbon reservoirs (Cuong and Warren, 2009; Legrand et al., 2011).\n\n\n5.3\nIntermediate stages of weathering\nThe most eye-catching feature of the saprock facies is the widespread iron oxide staining, while the rock retains its coherence (Fig. 3B). The measured density of 2.47\u00a0g\/cm3 is likely related to the increase in observable open pores to about 5% (Figs. 6 and 13). The low degree of chemical alteration is suggested by the CIA of 56 (Fig. 13), however, incipient alteration of plagioclase is suggested by the release of Ca and Na (Fig. 14). In addition, both Fe and Mg were leached due to biotite alteration. Most of the chloritised biotites are pseudomorphically transformed, most likely corresponding to the increase of chlorite-smectite at the expense of chlorite (Fig. 12). The observed opening and interconnection of transecting pores presumptively allowed for increased rates of fluid transportation by advection (Bazilevskaya et al., 2013), and likely accelerated biotite alteration that again promoted reaction-induced fracturing in a self-reinforcing process (R\u00f8yne et al., 2008).\n\n\n5.4\nAdvanced stages of weathering\nThe onset of the lower saprolite facies corresponds with a drop in the Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) ratio (Fig, 11), and the micromorphological observation of altered individual plagioclase crystals (Fig. 6) reflecting the plagioclase reaction front (Bazilevskaya et al., 2015). XRD analysis suggests that the absolute dissolution of plagioclase is minor, and that formation of kaolinite at the expense of plagioclase only results in a clay volume of only about 3% of the total rock (Table 5). CIA track the chemical weathering of feldspars, and the values in the advanced stages of weathering (Fig. 14) suggest incipient \u2013 intermediate degrees of chemical alteration (Fedo et al., 1995). The low CIA values are in accordance with the observed conservation of K-feldspar, and the partial preservation of biotite and plagioclase through the advanced stages of weathering (Fig. 6). However, chemical alteration of plagioclase and biotite in the saprolite facies is reflected in the mass balance analysis, showing depletion of Ca, Na, P, Mn, Mg and Fe (Fig. 13). Notwithstanding, these labile elements make up <10% of the parent material (Table 7), and thus their contribution to the overall mass flux are minor, as demonstrated by the small variations in \u03c4b (Fig. 14). The most abundant element in the parent material, Si (69.33%) (Table 7), is largely immobile through the regolith profile (Fig. 13), and is retained within the primary silicates and secondary clays. These results are in accordance with thermodynamic models by Perri el al. (2015) suggesting close to isochemical weathering processes of the Sila granodiorite at this location. In contrast, in a study of argillaceous weathering under tropical climate in Rio Icacos, Puerto Rico, reported the removal of almost half of the original mass (White et al., 1998; Riebe et al., 2003, 2021). Under such conditions, the high degree of mass removal was likely related to the mobility of Si, in the advanced stages of weathering (Riebe et al., 2003).\nThe drop in measured density to 1.66\u00a0g\/cm3 (Fig. 14D, Table 7) indicates formation of pore space (\u03c6c\u00a0=\u00a038%) (Fig. 14E) that, in the absence of major loss of mass, likely involved an increase in rock volume. Total pores observed (\u03c6obs) under the microscope was about 9% and are dominated by transmineral fractures (Figs. 6 and 7). Moderate \u2013 strong chemical alteration of individual plagioclase grains presumptively contributed to the opening of grain contacts, as the neoformed material is not occupying the full available volume after the parent mineral (Delvigne, 1998). The well-connected transmineral microfractures are for the most part open (Figs. 7 and 9G), except for some infilling of FeOx and neoformed clay films, suggesting the existence of an open pore network that allows increased fluid infiltration. The observed clay coatings may have protected the primary minerals from further chemical weathering (Velde and Meunier, 2008).\nThe division of the saprolite facies into a lower and upper saprolite was mainly based on the mechanical properties of the rock observed during sampling, but was also reflected in the reduction of Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) (Fig. 11) and an upwards increase in open pores (Fig. 7). Upwards increase in mineral alteration is evident for both biotite and plagioclase and coincides with the growth of pores (Figs. 5\u20137). The cracking of individual grains resulted in fragmentation of the primary minerals, thus reducing the overall grain size and increasing the surface area available for chemical reactions (Meunier, 2005). The relative durability of isomineralic interfaces is summarised as Qz\/Qz\u00a0\u226b\u00a0Kfs\/Kfs\u00a0\u226b\u00a0Pl\/Pl (Fig. 10). Plagioclase is more vulnerable to disintegration because of planes of weakness such as twinning and zoning (e.g., Heins, 1995), indicating a pattern in agreement with that found within the plutoniclastic sand-sized detritus studied by Heins (1995), Caracciolo et al. (2012) and Weltje et al. (2018). Both Bt\/Bt and Ms\/Ms interfaces appear very sporadic, or are lacking in the upper saprolite samples, indicating comminution towards silt- or clay-size mode (e.g., Slatt and Eyles, 1981; Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Caracciolo et al., 2012; Weltje et al., 2018).\nFurthermore, the open microfracture growth in saprolite with respect to the less weathered rocks, also produces a significant reduction in the effective shear strength and stiffness (Perri et al., 2016). This process, coupled with an increase of hydraulic conductivity, plays an important role in the development of different types of slope instability in the Sila massif and in similar geological settings (Perri et al., 2016).\n\n\n5.5\nMixture of reworked rock fragments and organic-rich soil\nThe soil horizons were distinguished by the absence of the original rock texture and high content of organic material. In thin sections, the colluvial material was identified as subrounded rock fragments, implying some transport. The mixture of moderately weathered rock fragments of colluvial origin and clay-rich soil can explain the enhanced Pl\/(Pl\u00a0+\u00a0Qz) ratios (Fig. 11), and the apparent increase in certain isomineralic and anisomineralic interfaces (Fig. 10), whereas the weathering indices, CIA and LOI, pointed towards more advanced degrees of chemical alteration (Fig. 14), due to the increase in clay content. The drop in K in the soil horizons (Fig. 13) may be related to the uptake of potassium by land plants, rendering K-feldspars unstable and promoting chemical weathering of mineral phases containing such elements in present-day Sila saprolite particles (Basu, 1981). The partly colluvial soil horizons are dominated by intermineral pores, and the rock fragments display less fracturing than the underlying saprolite (Fig. 8).\n\n\n5.6\nVolumetric strain-inducing processes\nCalculated and observed porosities increase as a function of closeness to the surface (Tables 2 and 7, Fig. 14E). The progression in porosities closely follow the calculated growth in volumetric strain (Fig. 14E and F), but appeared less related to the ambiguous \u03c4bulk trend (Fig. 14A). Therefore, the largest fraction of porosity formation is likely a result of volumetric strain inducing processes, with mass loss being subordinate.\nSeveral processes may contribute to the generation of volumetric strain (Parizek and Girty, 2014; Anderson, 2019; Hayes et al., 2019; Riebe et al., 2021):\n\n(1)\nThe study area is located at an elevation of c. 1160 m asl and experiences heavy rainfall and occasional temperatures below freezing during the winter season (Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000). Freeze-thaw cycles are a well-known cause of physical weathering, but the phenomenon is not a prerequisite for arenaceous weathering (Sequeira-Braga et al., 1990; Anderson, 2019).\n\n\n(2)\nThe Calabria region is situated in a complex tectonic area and the Sila Massif has experienced rapid uplift of 0.8\u20131.1\u00a0mm\/yr and removal of overburden since the Quaternary (Westaway, 1993), promoting the formation of large-scale fractures that will increase the hydraulic conductivity and hence weathering of the rock (Guzzetta, 1974; Molnar et al., 2007; Navarre-Sitchler et al., 2015; Clair et al., 2015; Novitsky et al., 2018).\n\n\n(3)\nVolumetric expansion of Fe-bearing minerals, such as biotite, interacting with oxygenated meteoric waters has been shown both experimentally and as a naturally occurring process (R\u00f8yne et al., 2008; Navarre-Sitchler et al., 2015; R\u00f8yne and Jamtveit, 2015). Volume change of \u226a1% can generate stresses high enough to cause cracking of the rock (R\u00f8yne and Jamtveit, 2015), and thus mineral expansion as a result of oxidation and subsequent vermiculation of iron rich biotite grains is regarded an important process in arenaceous weathering (Isherwood and Street, 1976; Le Pera and Sorriso-Valvo, 2000; Fletcher et al., 2006; Scarciglia et al., 2007; Buss et al., 2008; Parizek and Girty, 2014; Webb and Girty, 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2016; Kajdas et al., 2017).\n\n\n(4)\nIt was also likely that the weathering of individual grains, particularly plagioclase, facilitated the progressive opening of fractures in the rock e.g. by weakening Pl\/Pl contacts (Fig. 10C), making the two processes mutually dependent, even though one of them may dominate the other under certain conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7\nImplications for hydrocarbon exploration\nIn argillaceous regoliths, porosity generally increases upwards, but there is typically a concomitant decrease in permeability due to collapse of the rock structure under its own weight and compaction (Dewandel et al., 2006; Meunier et al., 2007; Velde and Meunier, 2008; Pacheco and Van der Weijden, 2012). Furthermore, the upwards increase in clay content in argillaceous regoliths may occlude permeability by plugging pores and microfractures, or by increasing the length and tortuosity of fluid pathways (Acworth, 1987; Vepraskas et al., 1991, 1996; Wright, 1992; Riber et al., 2017).\nAlthough less studied, the upwards development in permeability in arenaceous regoliths may follow the increasing porosity, as the scarcity of clays allow fluid pathways to remain open even in the advanced stages of weathering (Graham et al., 1997). In a study from the Serre Massif (Calabria, southern Italy) (Fig. 1A), Ietto et al. (2016) analysed fifteen boreholes that penetrated highly weathered arenaceous regoliths and reported an increase in weathering, porosity and permeability with closeness to the surface. These results are in accordance with a study on granitic regoliths from Scandinavia, reporting a positive relationship between permeability and the number of microfractures (Lothe et al., 2018).\nPaleo-highs that were subaerially exposed for long times, likely experienced multiple and partly overlapping weathering episodes before burial (Molina et al., 1991; Rosenau et al., 2013). The polygenetic nature of some paleoregoliths may explain why some workers have reported regolith profiles comprising a layer of arenacous saprolites below an argillaceous interval (Jones, 1985; Acworth, 1987; Lachassagne et al., 2011). Therefore, two pore systems with contrasting flow properties may be present in the same vertical regolith profile, and this should be considered when evaluating the reservoir potential for petroleum, groundwater or geothermal fluids in such rocks.\nDuring burial, modification of reservoir properties occur when the confining pressure increases (e.g. Bj\u00f8rlykke and H\u00f8eg, 1997). Experiments on clay rich aggregates have shown that differences in amount and type of clays will influence how porosity and permeability are modified with depth (Mondol et al., 2007), and these relationships may be valid also for buried regoliths (Lothe et al., 2018). When the confining pressure increases, argillaceous regoliths experience greater reduction of porosity and permeability than arenaceous regoliths (Lothe et al., 2018). Furthermore, the larger grain size of kaolinite compared to smectite, suggests that kaolinite rich regoliths are more compressible than regoliths dominated by smectite (Mondol et al., 2007; Lothe et al., 2018). At low confining pressures, the permeability reduction of naturally fractured rocks are dominated by closure of macrofractures, whereas permeability within microfracture networks can be maintained at typical reservoir depths (\u223c2\u00a0km burial) (Nara et al., 2011). Thus, it is important to know the type of pore system when predicting evolution of flow properties during burial of regoliths and other fractured reservoir rocks.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nTwo main weathering processes are responsible for the creation of pores in saprolites. In arenaceous saprolites, dilation increases the rock volume whereas in argillaceous saprolites pore creation is dominated by dissolution and removal of material. Arenaceous weathering of the Sila Massif granodiorite, with its closely interlocking crystals, transformed it into altered and disaggregated saprolite and soil. This is an example of how physico-chemical processes interact in certain environments to modify the physical and textural rock properties, producing low to moderate compositional adjustments. Saprolites dominated by arenaceous weathering, as observed in Calabria, can be identified by their mineralogical, geochemical and physical properties. In arenaceous saprolites, weathering progresses by the growth of microfractures and breakage of crystal interfaces, whereas the primary minerals are partially preserved.\nIncreasing volumetric strain, as expressed by an increase in fracture frequency and aperture, are considered the main cause of pore formation; it was concluded that mass removal is a subordinate process in pore formation in arenaceous saprolites. The well-connected and open microfractures that characterise the pore network in arenaceous saprolites likely improve the hydraulic conductivity of the rock, and permeability may be retained within such microfracture networks at reservoir depths. When evaluating storage capacity and fluid flow in weathered and fractured crystalline rocks, a deep understanding of the alteration history and pore development is vital.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nLars Riber: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Writing- Review and Editing, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Investigation.\n\nEmilia Le Pera: Supervision, Project Administration, Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Writing- Review and Editing, Formal analysis, Validation, Resources, Investigation.\n\nConsuele Morrone: Formal analysis, Writing- Review and Editing, Investigation, Validation.\n\nFabio Ietto: Writing- Review and Editing, Resources, Investigation.\n\nMassimo Conforti: Formal analysis, Validation, Writing- Review and Editing, Resources, Investigation.\n\nHenning Dypvik: Supervision, Project Administration, Methodology, Writing- Review and Editing, Investigation.\n\n","87":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSalt minibasins are small basins, or depressions, surrounded by upwelling salt whose movement is dependent on the loading of synkinematic strata onto relatively thick evaporite successions (Jackson and Talbot, 1986; Jackson and Hudec, 2017). This forms a feedback loop between continuous sedimentation in salt minibasins and halokinesis. Primary and secondary minibasins are two fundamental types of basin identified in such settings, resting either on autochthonous or allochthonous salt, or on an equivalent salt weld. Consequently, secondary minibasins do not contain the oldest suprasalt stratigraphy that marks the early stages of halokinesis (Pilcher et al., 2011; Jackson and Hudec, 2017). Distinct fault families may occur around salt minibasins, with their geometry, orientation and distribution being closely related to the growth of the minibasin per se (Lopez, 1990; Rowan et al., 1999). For example, crestal faults are commonly developed above salt structures that surround minibasins, and they usually form planar growth faults rooting into the crests of diapirs, generating symmetric grabens above the latter (Rowan et al., 1999; Van Den Berg et al., 2004). In parallel, corridor faults pertain to faults generated above buried salt pillows, observed to connect discrete, but distant, salt structures. Corridor faults are often planar and comprise structural corridors that are preferential pathways for fluid (Mattos and Alves, 2018). Listric faults are another geometry of faults commonly observed in salt minibasins (Lopez, 1990; Diegel et al., 1995; Rowan et al., 1999). Their dip becomes gentler with depth, a geometry resulting in their characteristic concave-upwards shape (e.g. Bally et al., 1981; Shelton, 1984; Imber et al., 2003). The generation of listric faults in salt minibasins is commonly associated with viscous or ductile layers at depth (Shelton, 1984; Dula Jr, 1991; Imber et al., 2003; Brun and Mauduit, 2008; Bose and Mitra, 2009) or, instead, overpressure build-up due to abnormal pore pressure gradients in faulted stratigraphic intervals (Mcneill et al., 1997; Mandl, 1999; Hillis, 2003; Suppe, 2014; Yuan et al., 2020). Sediment compaction also plays an important role in forming listric faults, as the faults must flatten after they are buried by continued sedimentation, due to sediment compaction (Davison, 1987; Cartwright and Lonergan, 1996; Cartwright and Mansfield, 1998; Xiao and Suppe, 1989). The development of these fault families, especially listric faults, in salt minibasins is significant for hydrocarbon exploration, fluid-flow characterisation and carbon and energy storage, as they can act as effective fluid pathways or, instead, can form favourable traps for fluid (Rowan et al., 1999; Cox et al., 2001; Gartrell et al., 2004).\nAs a typical salt-bearing basin in SE Brazil, the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin comprises multiple fault families developed in the vicinity of growing salt structures (Fiduk et al., 2004; Mattos and Alves, 2018). In this same basin, Demercian et al. (1993) and Fiduk et al. (2004) have related the largest listric faults to extension accomodated on the proximal parts of the margin due to gravitational spreading and gliding of overburden rocks over Aptian salt. Ze and Alves (2016) have shown that relatively small listric faults accommodate strain and stress on the crests of the salt structures. Ze and Alves (2021) have revealed the existence of fluid flow through strata-bound domino faults in vicinity of the study area, whereas Mattos and Alves (2018) have studied the fault families around salt diapirs, showing that fault corridors linking adjacent salt structures are favourable fluid migration pathways. Nevertheless, little is known about the distribution and evolution history of different fault families in large areas of SE Brazil, and the South Atlantic as a whole.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution, evolution history and significance of distinct fault families in a salt minibasin formed in deep-water sectors of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Fig. 3\n\n\n). This work will also implement stress analyses to the interpreted fault families in the study area and indicate the potential fluid flow pathways in salt minibasins. In summary, this paper addresses the following research questions:\n\na)\nWhat is the importance of listric faults and their soling out intervals as structures signing the presence of rheologically weak, muddy successions in salt minibasins?\n\n\nb)\nWhat is the chronology of faulting around salt structures when comparing them to other fault families in the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin?\n\n\nc)\nWhich of the interpreted fault families is more favourable to form fluid-flow pathways in salt minibasins?\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin is located on the southeast continental margin of Brazil and covers an area of \u223c125,000\u00a0km2, of which 107,000\u00a0km2 are located offshore (Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). The basin is bounded to the north by the Abrolhos Plateau, a volcanic ridge separating the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin from the Mucuri and Cumuruxatiba basins. To the south, it is separated from the Campos Basin by a largely political boundary, as there is a continuum of rift, sub-salt and supra-salt units from the Campos to the Esp\u00edrito Santo basins (Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2010; Mattos and Alves, 2018). The Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin includes a series of rift basins trending N\u2013S to NNE-SSW that were formed due to Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous continental rifting and subsequent breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Fiduk et al., 2004; Mohriak et al., 2008; Alves, 2012; Piedade and Alves, 2017). The tectonic evolution of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin is similar to most rift basins in the South Atlantic Ocean, and can be divided into four separate stages: rift onset, syn-rift, transitional, and drift (Chang et al., 1992; Bruhn and Walker, 1997; Cobbold et al., 2001; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2012) (Fig. 2).\n\n2.1\nRift-related evolution of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin\nThe rift onset stage of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin occurred in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and was characterised by the initiation of lithospheric extension at a regional scale (Ojeda, 1982; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Fiduk et al., 2004; Mohriak et al., 2008). Moderate tectonism and intense volcanism occurred throughout SE Brazil during this stage, with the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin becoming rapidly filled with coarse-grained fluvial sediment, alluvial fan deposits and localised evaporites (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Mohriak and Rosendahl, 2003).\nThe syn-rift stage lasted from late Berriasian\/Valanginian to the early Aptian (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa, 2011; Qin et al., 2016). It was marked by intense tectonism due to the enhanced lithospheric extension and asthenospheric uplift that accompanied the formation of the Eastern Brazilian Rift (Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Mohriak and Rosendahl, 2003). Syn-rift units comprise lacustrine sediments in elongated and faulted sub-basins formed between the Santos and the Sergipe\/Alagoas Basins. Three main facies associations were deposited at this stage: 1) alluvial fan\/fan deltas and transitional deposits, 2) lacustrine marls and shales, and 3) lacustrine pelecypod limestones, usually termed coquinas (Ojeda, 1982; Demercian et al., 1993; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999).\n\n\n2.2\nHalokinesis and Cenozoic evolution\nThe transitional stage occurred from early Aptian to late Aptian\/early Albian, a period of time associated with continental breakup occurring to the east (i.e. outboard) of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves et al., 2020). At this stage, the activity of large faults became concentrated at the locus of continental breakup to the east. Lithospheric extension significantly enhanced regional subsidence as recorded by the deposition of shallow water microbial carbonates, followed by the precipitation and accumulation of >3000\u00a0m of evaporites on the SE Brazil-West Africa conjugate margin (Davison et al., 2012). Such a transitional unit reflects a continental-breakup sequence with a typical regressive-transgressive cycle (Alves and Cunha, 2018; Alves et al., 2020).\nThe drift stage spanned from the Albian to present-day and marks the main phase of ocean spreading between South America and Africa (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa, 2011). At this stage, tectonic activity was chiefly associated with thermal subsidence and marine deposition predominated in the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999). The drift stage comprises two distinct megasequences: an early drift transgressive megasequence and a late drift regressive megasequence (Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999). The early drift transgressive megasequence records the deposition of carbonate intervals below muddy and sandy turbidites, representing shallow water environments that deepened upwards until the end of the Cretaceous (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2016). The late drift regressive megasequence was marked by open marine deposition, reflecting the progressive filling of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin's continental shelf and slope (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak et al., 2008).\nDue to regional extension and continuous subsidence, halokinesis occurred in the study area in response to differential loading by overburden strata, gravity spreading and downslope gravity gliding on top of evaporite successions (Demercian et al., 1993; Fiduk et al., 2004). Halokinesis lasted from the Albian to Holocene but peaked during the Late Cenozoic (Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves, 2012). It divided the basin into three tectonic domains with different structural styles: proximal extensional, transitional and distal compressional (Rouby et al., 2003; Vendeville, 2005; Gamboa et al., 2010; Mohriak et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2016). The proximal extensional domain includes salt rollers, salt walls along conjugate normal faults, turtle anticlines and rafts (Mohriak et al., 2008). The transitional domain is characterised by salt diapirs, while the distal compressional domain is dominated by allochthonous salt (Demercian et al., 1993; Davison, 2007).\n\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nThis paper uses a high-quality 3D seismic volume acquired in deep-water Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin in 2004, covering 360\u00a0km2 (Fig. 1). It was shot at a water depth ranging from 1630 to 2050 m. The seismic volume was acquired with a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05700\u00a0km array of streamers, and it was pre-stacked time migrated with a 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012.5\u00a0m grid line spacing. Seismic data processing included resampling, spherical divergence corrections and zero-phase conversions, all undertaken prior to data stacking (Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves, 2012; Ze and Alves, 2016; Piedade and Alves, 2017). Data are displayed using the European SEG standard for polarity in which a change in acoustic impedance from low to high is shown as a red seismic reflection, and from high to low is shown in black. The seismic volume was processed in the time domain following a sampling rate of 2\u00a0ms, re-sampled at 4\u00a0ms, with a dominant frequency of 40\u00a0Hz. This resulted in a minimum vertical resolution (1\/4 of the wavelet frequency, or \u03bb\/4) ranging from 11 to 19\u00a0m at the depth of strata investigated in this work (Mattos and Alves, 2018). In addition, two wells located in vicinity of the study area provide gamma-ray, lithology and Vp (p-wave velocity) data (Biancardi et al., 2020). Well correlations were also completed to identify lithological variations in the seismic-stratigraphic units interpreted in this study, and a chronostratigraphic framework was established based on Ze and Alves (2021) (Fig. 4\n).\nThe study area comprises a 20-km long, 6-km wide, NE-striking salt minibasin bounded to the west by two salt diapirs (A and B), and by a salt wall to the east (Figs. 1 and 3). Eight (8) key seismic-stratigraphic reflections, including the seafloor, were interpreted every ten lines (125\u00a0m) in our seismic volume (Figs. 5\u20138\n\n\n\n). Three principal stratigraphic units were defined based on their internal seismic reflection characters, bounding reflection terminations, and their relationship with main structural features. Variance time-slices were used to identify relevant fault families around salt structures (Fig. 3), as they clearly show important discontinuities on time slices, including faults and fractures (Brown, 2011).\nFive hundred and thirty-four (534) faults were manually interpreted every two crosslines\/inline (25\u00a0m). They were classified into four different fault families based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures. This procedure guaranteed high-enough accuracy when recording displacement data for distinct fault segments, as it complies with the minimum sampling interval defined in Ze and Alves (2019). The latter authors proposed that minimum throw\/displacement sampling intervals are related to the length of a fault; sampling intervals should be less than 5% of the fault length when the latter is\u00a0<\u00a03500\u00a0m, or 3% of the fault length when this is\u00a0>\u00a03500\u00a0m. In addition, the rose diagrams and histograms of strike and dip of each fault family were plotted by using fault-point data on Move, and the radius value of the rose diagram is plotted as a ratio (Fig. 10\n\n). The fault-point data were received by discretising faults that were interpreted on Schlumberger's Petrel\u00ae into facets, and time-depth conversions were implemented for these data on Move\u00ae.\nLater in our workflow, eight representative faults from the four interpreted fault families were selected to compile displacement-length along fault (Dmax-L) and displacement-depth (D-Z) plots, which were used to evaluate fault growth history in the investigated minibasin (Figs. 11\u201314\n\n\n\n). Fault displacement was calculated using trigonometry rules to discern the throw and heave for a fault, considering the fault as a pure dip-slip fault. Listric faults record a large amount of horizontal offset (heave) and using throw would be a limiting over-simplification in our analysis.\nThe relationship between maximum displacement (Dmax) and length (L) of a fault trace provides insights into the mechanisms of fault initiation, growth and evolution through time (Watterson, 1986; Walsh and Watterson, 1988; Peacock and Sanderson, 1991; Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Kim and Sanderson, 2005). The relationship between fault displacement (D) and depth (Z) provides insights into fault reactivation or nucleation positions (Mansfield and Cartwright, 1996; Cartwright and Mansfield, 1998; Baudon and Cartwright, 2008a; Baudon and cartwright, 2008b).\nStress inversions were completed using the Stress Analysis Module on Move\u00ae, which is based on the direct inversion method of Angelier (1990) by using dip-slip data of the interpreted faults including dip and dip azimuth. We estimated the orientation and distribution of palaeostress tensors responsible for the formation of each fault family observed in the study area, with the exception of listric faults. Listric and keystone faults were formed under the same stress field in the minibasin, suggesting that the palaeostress tensors obtained from keystone faults can be applied to listric faults.\nSlip tendency and leakage factors were also computed in Move's\u00ae Stress Analysis Module using the palaeostress azimuths obtained from stress inversions. For this stage in our analysis, faults and horizons interpreted in Petrel\u00ae were imported into Petroleum Experts Move\u00ae as 3D mesh surfaces, and later filtered for edge triangles. Key fault attributes, including true dip, strike and azimuth for each fault vertex, were created in Move\u00ae using the Attribute Analyser Toolbar. In addition, normalised leakage factors values were also calculated for each fault family, estimating favourable fluid pathways amongst the four fault families. As the palaeostress tensors obtained from stress inversion are not those representing the present-day stress regime, slip tendency and leakage factor analyses in this work comprise certain limitations, and do not fully indicate the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area at present. However, they represent the stresses that generated the faults interpreted in this work, and highlight any changes in the azimuth of such stresses in time and space, in the study area.\nSlip tendency (Ts) indicates the likelihood of a fault to slip, and is defined as the ratio of resolved shear (\u03c4) to normal stress (\u03c3n) (Equation (1); Morris et al., 1996; Lisle and Srivastava, 2004). It has no units and ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of a fault to slip. It is dependent on the differential stress ratio and on the orientation of the fault surface in relation to the orientation of a given stress field. Therefore, the slip tendency can be expressed as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nT\ns\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeakage factor (L) is a measure of the fluid transmissivity of faults, and is defined as the ratio of pore pressure (Pp) to the difference between normal (\u03c3n) and shear stresses (\u03c4) on a particular fault surface (Equation (2); Mattos and Alves, 2018; Ze and Alves, 2021). Pore pressure used in this study is the normal hydrostatic pressure calculated based on the depth we consider the fault have first nucleated. Leakage factor determines the likelihood of fault-seal failure; the higher the value, the greater the likelihood of a fault to act as a pathway for fluid. Therefore, the leakage factor can be written as:\n\n(2)\n\n\nL\n=\n\n\nP\nP\n\n\/\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSeismic stratigraphy\n\n4.1\nUnit 1 (horizons H0 to H3)\nUnit 1 is the primary seismic interval of interest, comprising a package of low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections somewhat similar to its underlying suprasalt strata (Figs. 5\u20138). The base of Unit 1 is marked by horizon H0, a low-to moderate-amplitude negative reflection tied to the base of Paleocene strata, whereas its top is bounded by a high-amplitude negative reflection defined as horizon H3 (Figs. 5\u20138). Between horizons H0 and H3, we mapped two other horizons (H1 and H2) with moderate-amplitude positive reflections (Figs. 5\u20138). These two horizons (H1 and H2) divide Unit 1 into three different sub-units, respectively named Unit 1a, 1b and 1c (Figs. 5\u20138). The amplitude of internal reflections in Unit 1a is slightly higher than in Unit 1b and 1c (Figs. 5\u20138). Faulting is common inside Unit 1, but most faults do not propagate below its lower boundary (horizon H0). This is likely due to the relatively higher ductility of strata in Unit 1 when compared to the intervals above and below, a character resulting in faults terminating at this level. Unit 1 is up to 600\u00a0ms thick in the salt minibasin of interest, but this value decreases slightly towards the flanks of adjacent salt structures (Fig. 9).\nUnit 1 is composed of shale in its upper part (Unit 1b and 1c) and marl in its lower part (Unit 1a), with varying thickness and relative proportions of shale vs. marl at various locations (Fig. 4). Thin mudstone layers occur as intercalations in the essentially marly Unit 1a. Due to lithological changes, gamma-ray values reveal significant variations at depth. Unit 1b and 1c record high gamma-ray values, especially Unit 1c, but they gradually decrease towards the base of Unit 1b. Importantly, there is an increase in gamma-ray values from Unit 1a to 1b, and this increase correlates with the boundary between shale to marl in well data (e.g., well 1-BRSA-1143D; Fig. 4). Unit 1a presents higher gamma-ray values than Units 1b and 1c above, indicating Unit 1a contains a higher volume of shale than these former. In addition, gamma-ray values continue to increase below horizon H0 towards the top of the Aptian salt, although values in Unit 1 are similar to the underlying suprasalt strata (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.2\nUnit 2 (horizons H3 to H4)\nUnit 2 is bounded at its base by horizon H3, and at the top by horizon H4, a moderate-to high-amplitude positive reflection (Figs. 5\u20138). At the middle of Unit 2 there is one high-amplitude negative reflection that correlates with the base of Eocene strata (Figs. 5\u20138). This unit comprises a 200\u2013500\u00a0ms thick package, which is the thickest (\u223c500\u00a0ms) in the studied salt minibasin (Fig. 9). Unit 2 is the thinnest (\u223c200\u00a0ms) above the salt diapirs (Fig. 9). The unit shows low-amplitude to transparent seismic reflections in its lower part, but its upper part is marked by moderate-to high-amplitude seismic reflections. Faulting is common, with most faults propagating upwards and downwards into Unit 2.\nThe lithology of Unit 2 is very similar to the interval between horizon H1 and H3 (Unit 1b and 1c), as both are composed of shale. However, Unit 2 does not show marked changes in lithology and gamma-ray curves remain high and relatively constant (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.3\nUnit 3 (horizon H4 to the seafloor)\nUnit 3 is bounded at its base by horizon H4, whereas its top coincides with the seafloor. Its thickness ranges from 400 to 800\u00a0ms, and shows low-amplitude to transparent internal reflections incised by submarine channels in some areas (Figs. 5\u20138). Two other horizons H5 and H6 were interpreted in this unit. Horizon H5 is a high-amplitude positive seismic reflection tied to the base of the Miocene, which is located two reflections above horizon H4 (Figs. 5\u20138). Horizon H6 is a high-amplitude positive reflection under another prominent high-amplitude negative reflection (Figs. 5\u20138). Most faults in the study area offset horizons H4 to H6, and many are truncated on their upper tips by mass-transport deposits (MTDs), which mark the remobilization of seafloor strata due to the influence of gravity forces.\nUnit 3 is mainly composed of clay and shows high, relative constant gamma-ray values in its lower part, especially between horizons H4 and H6 (Fig. 4). Its top part comprises a large volume of turbidites, which present relative low gamma-ray values.\n\n\n\n5\nFault families around salt structures\nFaults developed in the study area comprise four (4) fault families based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures: a) crestal faults, b) corridor faults, c) listric faults, and d) keystone faults (Figs. 3 and 10). Crestal faults include radial and concentric faults developed above salt structures due to halokinesis. Corridor faults pertain to faults connecting different salt structures, forming structural corridors that are preferential pathways for fluid (Mattos and Alves, 2018). Keystone and listric faults were developed in salt minibasins, but their geometries and periods of activity showed significant differences. In this section, we select eight (8) representative faults from the four fault families to compile displacement-length (Dmax-L) and displacement-depth (D-Z) plots (Figs. 11\u201314). These data are used to evaluate the growth history of faults.\n\n5.1\nCrestal faults\nA total of 239 crestal faults were manually mapped over salt diapir A, which is located in the northern part of the study area (Fig. 3). Crestal faults are well developed above this diapir, offsetting horizons H4 to H6 upwards to a depth just below a near-seafloor MTD (Figs. 3 and 5). Downwards, they terminate in Unit 1 to form graben structures above diapir A (Fig. 5). Crestal faults strike towards the NNE and have dips over 42\u00b0 (Figs. 9 and 10).\nCrestal faults 1 (CF1) and 2 (CF2) are respectively 1.5\u00a0km and 1.8\u00a0km long, N-striking, but show opposite dips; CF1 dips to the east, while CF2 dips to the west (Fig. 5). Their maximum displacement reaches 135\u00a0m and 153\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 11). Crestal fault CF1 grew by the lateral linkage of distinct segments, as shown by the rugged profile of its Dmax-L plot. A prominent linkage point is located around the position of profile e (Fig. 11). It is also clear from our D-Z data that the maximum displacement of CF1 occurs around horizon H3, with a decrease in displacement occurring between horizons H3 and H4 (Fig. 11). This suggests fault reactivation during the deposition of Unit 2.\nCrestal fault CF2 is an isolated fault revealing a rugged \u2018C\u2019 type in Dmax-L data (Fig. 11b). However, similarly to CF1, it shows multiple displacement minima values, implying that it was formed by dip linkage. The maximum displacement of CF2 occurs below horizon H3, showing that it first nucleated at this depth (Fig. 11). Interestingly, there are marked drops in displacement around horizon H3, especially around the position of profile g (Fig. 11g), suggesting that fault reactivation occurred at this level.\n\n\n5.2\nCorridor faults\nForty-five (45) corridor faults were recognised in the region between salt diapirs A and B, in the northwest part of the study area (Fig. 3). Corridor faults are NE-striking, with dips over 39\u00b0, and offset strata between horizons H1 to H6 (Figs. 6 and 10). Some large corridor faults also offset strata at horizon H0 and below (Fig. 6). They strike in a similar direction to the radial faults formed between diapirs A and B (Figs. 3 and 9).\nCorridor faults 1 (CoF1) and 2 (CoF2) were chosen as representative corridor faults in the study area (Fig. 3). They are 2.5\u00a0km and 2.2\u00a0km long and dip to the northwest, with displacement maxima of 97\u00a0m and 99\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 12). CoF1 offsets strata between H1 and terminates below the near-seafloor MTDs, while CoF2 offsets strata between H0 and H6. Both faults are single, isolated faults, as they have typical \u2018C-type\u2019 profiles in Dmax-L plots (Fig. 12). Their displacement maxima occur around horizon H3, indicating they nucleate around horizon H3. In addition, both faults record a decrease in displacement between horizons H3 and H4 (Fig. 12). This suggests that fault reactivation occurred at the level of Unit 2.\n\n\n5.3\nListric faults\nTen (10) listric faults were mapped as NW- to WNW-striking structures dipping to the northeast (Figs. 3 and 7\u20139). In plan-view, listric faults are curved, show variable lengths, and are cross-cut by adjacent faults (Figs. 3 and 9). On vertical seismic profiles, they are steep in their upper part but gradually sole out into Unit 1 (Figs. 7 and 8). Their dip ranges from 2\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 (Fig. 10), as they are gentler than the other fault families. Most listric faults are growth faults, i.e. they show thickening in strata adjacent to hanging-wall depocenters, a character that can be used to indicate their relative ages (Childs et al., 2003, 2017). Listric faults also reveal larger displacements when compared to the other fault families; they can be interpreted as structures accommodating extension along a NE-SW direction (Figs. 9 and 13).\nRepresentative listric faults 1 (LF1) and 2 (LF2) are 2.4\u00a0km and 3.2\u00a0km long, with displacement maxima of 1254\u00a0m and 717\u00a0m, respectively (Figs. 9 and 13). They offset strata between horizons H4 and H6, soling out in the uppermost part of Unit 1 (Figs. 7, 8 and 13). Both listric faults are offset by other faults, especially LF1, indicating they were formed earlier than the faults that offset them. Because of these offsetting faults, LF1 and LF2 show rugged shapes in their Dmax-L plots (Fig. 13). For instance, the marked displacement minima recorded between horizons H3 and H4 in D-Z profiles were also caused by younger faults offsetting them (Fig. 13). Displacement maxima in both LF1 and LF2 are recorded between horizons H3 and H4, implying the two faults nucleated at this depth (Fig. 13). Interestingly, the positions of displacement maxima are recorded close to the listric faults\u2019 lower tips (Figs. 7, 8 and 13), indicating they were not formed by the linkage between a steeply dipping fault and a gently dipping detachment. They nucleated around their lower tips, and propagated upwards (with minor downward propagation) to generate their present-day curvature.\n\n\n5.4\nKeystone faults\nTwo-hundred and forty (240) keystone faults were mapped in the salt minibasin of interest and they offset variable strata spanning horizons H0 to H6 (Figs. 7 and 8). Keystone faults are mainly NW-striking, relatively steep (>46.8\u00b0), with a few NE-striking faults occurring in the southern part of the minibasin (Figs. 3 and 8).\nKeystone faults 1 (KF1) and 2 (KF2) were chosen as representative faults in this work. They are 1.4\u00a0km and 3.1\u00a0km long, with displacement maxima of 114\u00a0m and 110\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 14). Both faults strike to the NW and dip to the southwest; they are also relatively steep and offset strata between horizons H1 to H6 (Figs. 7 and 8). KF1 records a displacement maximum around horizon H3 (Fig. 14), indicating that it first nucleated at this level. There is also significant displacement minima below horizon H4 (Fig. 14f), suggesting KF1 might have experienced some degree of reactivation at this level. KF2 is formed by lateral segment linkage as there is significant displacement minima along its striking direction, which correlate with the linkage points observed in variance time-slices (Fig. 3). The maximum displacement value for KF2 occurs near horizon H2 (Fig. 14), showing it nucleated at this level.\n\n\n\n6\n3D visualisation of listric faults and investigated relationship with specific shale units\nListric faults are well developed in the investigated salt minibasin and their lengths vary from 1.8\u00a0km to 4.9\u00a0km. They are also observed at different depths in the study area (Figs. 7\u20139 and 15\n). It is clear that listric faults developed in the south of the minibasin are deeper when compared to similar faults to the north (Figs. 7\u20139 and 15). In addition, growth strata reveal that listric faults in the south were formed earlier than those in the north. Two listric faults in the south of the minibasin were developed in Unit 1, with strata thickening in their hanging-wall depocenters (Fig. 15). In contrast, in the north of the minibasin, LF1 and LF2 sole out at the top interval of Unit 1 (Figs. 7 and 8), and growth strata indicate they were formed after the deposition of Unit 1.\nA key characteristic is that all listric faults analysed in this work sole out at the level of Unit 1, a package of low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections (Figs. 7, 8 and 15). Furthermore, borehole data show that Unit 1 is composed of shale and marl with high gamma-ray values (Fig. 4). Overpressure in Unit 1 is suggested by the existence of large pockmarks close to the upper tips of listric faults rooting at depth in this unit (Figs. 7 and 8). In fact, large-scale pockmarks have been previously considered to indicate the episodic loss of fluid due to overpressure build-up in underlying strata (M\u00fcller et al., 2018). Additionally, listric faults in the study area sole out into Unit 1, but they have not offset its lower boundary.\nWe interpret the formation of listric faults as related to local overpressure based on the mechanism proposed by Yuan et al. (2020). This may also explain the fact that listric faults in the south of minibasin formed earlier and deeper than those in the north, since Unit 1 is deepening to the south and local overpressures were putatively reached earlier in this part of the investigated salt minibasin when compared to its northern part.\n\n\n7\nFluid-flow potential in distinct fault families\nTo understand the orientation and distribution of the principal palaeostress tensors in the study area, stress inversions were completed for all interpreted fault families. Stress inversion results for the 534 faults interpreted in the study area show a stress tensor with a sub-vertical \u03c31 plunging 86.78\u00b0 along an N39.21\u00b0 azimuth. A sub-horizontal \u03c32 plunges \u22122.07\u00b0 along an N349.32\u00b0 azimuth, accompanied by \u03c33 plunging \u22122.46\u00b0 along an N79.41\u00b0 azimuth. However, as there are more than two preferential strike directions for faults in the study area due to halokinesis, we completed stress inversions separately for each fault family to obtain their own principal palaeostress tensors except listric faults (Table 1\n). Listric faults and keystone faults were formed under the same stress field in minibasin, and most listric faults were offset by keystone faults, suggesting that the palaeostress tensors obtained from keystone faults can be applied to listric faults. We thus used the stress inversions results described above to complement slip tendency and leakage factor analyses for each fault family (Figs. 16 and 17\n\n).\nSlip tendency models reveal marked differences among the four interpreted fault families (Fig. 16). Keystone faults record the largest average slip tendency (0.65), with values varying from 0.38 to 0.95 (Fig. 16e). In addition, NW-striking keystone faults record significantly higher slip tendency values than NE-striking keystone faults, meaning that the former (keystone) faults have the highest probability to slip. Corridor faults show the second largest average slip tendency (0.63), with ranges in slip tendency similar to keystone faults, from 0.38 to 0.9 (Fig. 16c). Crestal faults have lower average slip tendency than corridor faults (0.55), and values range from 0.3 to 0.83 (Fig. 16b). Listric faults become the lowest average slip tendency (0.15), with values ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 (Fig. 16d). These observations suggest that listric faults have the lowest tendency to slip.\nNormalised leakage factors were also calculated based on the stress tensor considered for each fault family, and they show similar trends to slip tendency (Fig. 17). The normalised leakage factor values for keystone faults mainly range from 0.45 to 0.95 with an average value of 0.72 (Fig. 17e), showing that these faults have the highest probability of conducting fluid among the four fault families. Corridor faults and crestal faults record similar average normalised leakage factor (0.71 and 0.66), with values ranging from 0.45 to 0.94 and 0.33 to 0.91, respectively (Fig. 17b and c). Listric faults show the lowest average normalised leakage factor (0.3), with values ranging from 0.11 to 0.56.\nAccording to the data described above, we find that keystone faults record the highest values for slip tendency and normalised leakage factors, and NW-striking keystone faults show larger values than other directions of keystone faults. Corridor and crestal faults have similar values for slip tendency and leakage factor. Conversely, listric faults show the lowest values in both slip tendency and leakage factors. Importantly, the dip and depth of faults significantly influences the calculated slip tendency and leakage factor values, as high-angle and shallow faults record higher values for both parameters than low angle and deep faults.\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nSignificance of listric faults and their soling out intervals\nOne of the key questions arising from our study concerns the significance of listric faults in salt minibasins. As previously mentioned in this work, listric faults sole out in Unit 1, which is composed of shale and marl with high gamma-ray values, as documented in borehole data (Fig. 4). In addition, multiple bright spots, one known indicator of hydrocarbons, are observed in the lower part of listric faults (Figs. 7, 8 and 15), showing that the lower part of listric faults acts as a barrier or seal to hydrocarbons and other fluids. Large pockmarks are also observed close to the upper tip of listric faults, indicating the existence of local strata overpressures.\nThe strata in which listric faults sole out overlies the thick salt rocks, indicating that potential overpressure occurs in suprasalt strata. These overpressures may be caused by dehydration at smectite-illite transition depths, or by the generation of hydrocarbons from source rocks, both occurring after reaching specific threshold temperatures (Bruce, 1984). The suprasalt strata below Unit 1 were deposited in the early drift-stage, correlating with upper Cretaceous intervals in the Lower Urucutuca Formation (Fig. 2). They comprise Cenomanian to Turonian transgressive marine deposits with type III kerogen, capable of producing high-API oils and gas (Mello and Maxwell, 1990; Fiduk et al., 2004). This kerogen should have reached thermal maturity - though buried at a relative shallow depth of around 1300\u20132000m - because a major thermal pulse in the early to middle Eocene has been recognised on multiple well data from the continental shelf. This thermal pulse is associated with the emplacement of the Abrolhos volcanic Plateau (Meisling et al., 2001; Cobbold et al., 2001; Gibbs et al., 2003; Fiduk et al., 2004). Due to the presence of bright spots in the lower part of listric faults, we suggest that overpressure in the study area was caused by the cracking of hydrocarbons in Cenomanian to Turonian strata, which was locally heated due to the high thermal conductivity of underlying salt.\nThe lower Urucutuca formation is composed of shale and marl, and shows the highest gamma-ray values in the study area (Fig. 4). At the same time, it comprises low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections in seismic data (Figs. 5\u20138 and 15). The interval into which listric faults sole out have similar seismic, lithological and petrophysical characters to Lower Urucutuca strata (Figs. 5\u20138 and 15). In parallel, the interval in question was deposited in an evolving salt minibasin, in which strata is potentially rich in organic carbon due to its restricted ocean circulation (Dow, 1984; Lopez, 1990). Thus, it is highly likely that listric fault sole out in ductile, potentially organic-rich shales and marls, though drilled wells crossing such horizon did not provide total organic carbon (TOC) data. The soling out intervals directly overlie Lower Urucutuca source-rock intervals deposited in the Cenomanian-Turonian (Cobbold et al., 2001; Gibbs et al., 2003; Fiduk et al., 2004), suggesting these intervals may be added to the known source-rock potential of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin.\n\n\n8.2\nFaults as markers of distinct stages of halokinesis\nTectonic faults are one of the most common brittle structures in sedimentary basins and provide important information about the evolution of a sedimentary basin. As part of a typical salt-bearing basin, the formation and evolution of faults in the study area have been strongly influenced by halokinesis. We have identified three evolutionary stages between horizon H0 and the seafloor in the study area, correlating to the drift stage of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Fig. 18\n).\nStage 1 (Paleocene), between seismic horizons H0 and H3, is characterised by the formation of a few NW- or WNW-striking listric faults, keystone faults, and marks the onset of reactive diapirism in the study area. Several WNW-striking listric faults revealing significant strata thickening in their hanging walls were formed during this stage (Figs. 9 and 15), and accommodated displacement along a NE-SW direction. At this same time, NW- to WNW-striking keystone faults were also developed, implying the establishment of a NE-SW direction of extension. However, the activity of salt diapirs and walls was minor during Stage 1, as only few crestal faults and corridor faults were formed around these same structures. Corroborating this interpretation, the thickness of strata between horizons H0 and H3 is relatively constant in the study area (Fig. 10), and no significant erosion occurred on top of salt structures (Fig. 18a). The relatively weak halokinesis can be explained by the absence of significant sediment loading and, as a result, NE-SW extension predominated in the study area during Stage 1.\nStage 2 (Late Paleocene-Early Oligocene), marked by strata deposited between horizons H3 and H4, records active diapirism as a consequence of enhanced sediment loading over the salt, and lead to the development of crestal and NE-striking corridor faults (Fig. 18b). A few NE- and NW-striking keystone faults, plus NW-striking listric faults, were also developed during this stage. Halokinesis was intensified with increasing sediment loads, with salt diapirs and walls developing by active diapirism. NE-striking corridor faults started to form at this stage, synchronously with crestal faults. In contrast to Stage 1, strata are thicker in salt minibasins (up to 450\u00a0m) compared to the units accumulated on top of salt structures (less than 200\u00a0m), proving that significant erosion, or non-deposition, occurred above the latter. Importantly, the development of several NW-striking listric faults and multiple NW-striking keystone faults still denote a predominant NE-SW direction of extension in the investigated salt minibasin.\nWith continuing halokinesis, the salt underlying the minibasins was withdrawn to feed the surrounding salt diapirs and walls, promoting moderate extension along a NW-SE direction (Fig. 18b). This eventually formed NE-striking faults, which intersected the NW-striking keystone and listric faults. Such a cross-cutting relationship is obvious in the southern part of the main salt minibasin as large volumes of salt were withdrawn in this region. Conversely, in the northern half of the minibasin there is only one small salt diapir below horizon H3, leading to the generation of crestal faults with different strikes (Fig. 18b).\nStage 3 (Late Oligocene-Recent), spanning strata between horizon H4 and the seafloor, is characterised by more intense (active) diapirism due to increased sediment loading, a process resulting in the formation of multiple crestal faults around salt structures, NE-striking corridor faults, NW-striking keystone faults and NE-striking keystone faults. These faults present variable geometries, although the main salt minibasin was still controlled by a NE-SW direction of extension, as NW-striking keystone faults were developed during this stage. There was also NW-SE extension in the southern part of the salt minibasin, which led to the generation of the NE-striking faults that intersect NW-striking keystone faults (Fig. 18c). In addition, these same keystone faults were formed after the listric faults considered in this work, and they offset the latter in the study area. Later in the evolution of the salt minibasin, a large mass-transport deposit (MTD) was accumulated near the seafloor due to widespread gravity spreading and downslope sediment movement (Figss. 4\u20137). In fact, MTDs exhibit a high variability in size and internal character in the study area (Biancardi et al., 2020), and truncate the upper tip of several faults, especially crestal faults developed above salt diapirs (Fig. 5).\n\n\n8.3\nImplications for the establishment of favourable fluid pathways\nFaults can act as effective conduits for fluid in sedimentary basins but, conversely, they can also locally act as barriers to fluid along fault zones (Cox et al., 2001; Gartrell et al., 2004). In practice, it is commonly difficult to determine whether a fault acts as conduit or barrier to fluid flow, as its sealing competence is influenced by multiple factors such as the lithology of the strata crossed by the fault, its displacement, fault-gouge geometry, fault geometry in relation to local stress fields, post-deformation cementation, interactions between fluids and host rock, etc. (Caine et al., 1996; Fisher and Knipe, 2001; Koledoye et al., 2003; Manzocchi et al., 2010). In the study area, four (4) fault families are developed around salt structures, and it is of great importance to identify and model the favourable pathways for fluid migrating from deeper strata (e.g. Gartrell et al., 2004; Hovland, 2007; Davison, 2009; Andresen et al., 2011). Fault and fluid flow mapping can also be helpful to predict geohazards associated with fluid flow and seafloor leakage such as submarine slope instability, or the sudden formation of pockmarks and near-seafloor fluid pipes (Elger et al., 2018; Cartwright et al., 2021). In this study, a normalised leakage factor was estimated for each of the four fault families to provide information about which is the most favourable fluid pathways.\nNormalised leakage factors are the highest for keystone faults, ranging from 0.45 to 0.95 for an average value of 0.73 (Fig. 15e). Keystone faults are thus highly likely to act as conduits for fluid. In addition, keystone faults were active during all three evolution stages considered in this work, propagating into Unit 1 \u2013 regarded as a potential source interval. This means keystone faults are more likely to contribute to the migration of fluid from deeply-buried source rocks to shallow reservoirs. Corridor and crestal faults show leakage factor values varying from 0.45 to 0.94 and 0.37 to 0.91, respectively, with average values of 0.71 and 0.66 (Fig. 17). The leakage factor values for corridor and crestal faults are similar to those of keystone faults, suggesting they are also likely to act as pathways for fluid. Most of these faults were formed during Stages 2 and 3 under the effect of active diapirism and have propagated at different depths, including into Unit 1. They were also developed on top of salt diapirs where hydrocarbon tends to accumulate, so the reservoirs close to the upper part of crestal faults and corridor faults are possible exploration targets.\nListric faults have the lowest normalised leakage factor value ranging from 0.11 to 0.56, with an average of 0.4, indicating that they are more likely to act as barriers and baffles to fluid. This character explains the multiple bright spots encountered in the lower part of listric faults. However, listric faults are usually growth faults in the study area, and were mainly formed during Stages 1 and 2. They continued to be active for a long period, promoting the leakage of fluid in their upper parts, and generating large pockmarks above their upper tips. Therefore, based on our leakage factor data, we propose that keystone faults constitute the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area. Corridor and crestal faults also show potential to form pathways for fluid flow, but listric faults are likely barriers to fluid, particularly in their lower parts.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nThis work aimed at understanding the distribution, evolution history and significance of different fault families in a salt minibasin, and any favourable fluid pathways offshore Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (SE Brazil). The main conclusions of this work can be summarised as follows:\n\na)\nFour fault families are identified based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures. Crestal faults were formed around salt structures together with radial and concentric faults. Corridor faults were developed among discrete salt diapirs, linking them through long corridors of oriented, conjugate fault families. Listric and keystone faults were formed in salt minibasins and were related to important extensional stresses.\n\n\nb)\nThe development of listric faults can indicate the existence of sub-surface overpressure in strata. Moreover, the intervals into which listric faults sole out comprise soft and ductile strata, which is high likely associated with source rocks. These intervals may be added to the known source-rock potential of a given basin, identifying their depth and relative thickness.\n\n\nc)\nThree fault evolution stages are identified in the study area. Stage 1 records the formation of a few NW- and WNW-striking listric and keystone faults in response to the onset of reactive diapirism. Stages 2 and 3 mark a shift to active diapirism in the study area promoted by increasing sediment loading, and lead to the formation of crestal, corridor and keystone faults.\n\n\nd)\nNormalised leakage factors show that keystone faults are the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area. Corridor and crestal faults also show potential as pathways for fluid. Conversely, listric faults are likely barriers and baffles to fluid, particularly in their lower parts.\n\n\n\n\n","88":"","89":"","90":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFolds are important deformation features that occur in compressional belts worldwide (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Mitra, 1990; Verg\u00e9s, 1993). Such structures have largely been a target for oil and gas exploration (Mitra, 1990), and in depleted oil fields, they depict important analogues for the assessment of CO2 storage potential (Mitiku and Bauer, 2013). Geological storage of CO2 (GSC) requires an appropriate reservoir placed at a suitable depth to guarantee efficiency (Alcalde et al., 2014; Bachu, 2000; Sun et al., 2020). However, the presence of fold-related fractures, which have a critical impact on the distribution of the reservoir quality, is not always easy to characterize at depth because they are usually below the resolution of standard geophysical techniques (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Casini et al., 2011; Gutmanis et al., 2018). Therefore, the orientation, extent and the implication of such fracture systems for reservoir potential in the subsurface can only be predicted by using geological models and outcrop analogues (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Sun et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015). Additionally, the formation of fold-related fractures strongly controls the origin, evolution and distribution of fluids that migrate during folding (Cosgrove, 2015; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Lefticariu et al., 2005). The appraisal of the fold-fracture relationships in natural field analogues is crucial: (i) to predict the orientation of fracture networks (fluid pathways) in areas where outcrops are absent (Bergbauer and Pollard, 2004); and, (ii) to identify the main factors controlling fluid-rock interactions in orogenic systems (Beaudoin et al., 2020; Callot et al., 2013; Ferket et al., 2006; Labeur et al., 2021; Roure et al., 2005; Swennen et al., 2000; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Vilasi et al., 2009). Beyond this, understanding the fluid flow and deformation relationships has become of renewed interest in applied fields mainly related to climate change mitigation (Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS) and in the transition to a net zero emissions energy (exploration of natural hydrogen or geothermal anomalies, among many others) (Benedicto et al., 2021; Cooper, 2007; Macgregor, 1996; Sun et al., 2020).\nDue to the economic importance of understanding the folding, fracturing and fluid flow relationships, several studies have reported the fluid system associated with the evolution of anticlines in the Pyrenees (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016; Martinez Casas et al., 2019; Nardini et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2022; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007) and in other worldwide compressional settings (Barbier et al., 2012; Beaudoin et al., 2011, 2020; Evans et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2009; Lefticariu et al., 2005). However, these studies have mainly focused on the fracture-controlled paleohydrological evolution through time or in fluid flow associated with specific domains of the fold (Cruset et al., 2016). Thereby, the spatial variation in the fluid flow behavior and the extent of fluid-rock interaction at the different structural position of a fold have been much less documented (Evans and Fischer, 2012).\nIn this contribution, we report the absolute timing of deformation together with the spatio-temporal variation of the fold-fluid system and the main factors controlling the fluid origin and distribution in different structural positions of a large-scale fold, using the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline in the Southern Pyrenees as an example. This anticline displays excellent exposures of pre- and syn-orogenic strata involving carbonate and clastic sedimentary units (Mencos, 2010; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Sim\u00f3, 1986). This fact, together with the presence of well data and seismic reflection profiling has allowed previous studies to characterize the fold geometry and the fold-related fracture systems (Mencos, 2010; Mencos et al., 2011; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Nardini et al., 2019; Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011; Verg\u00e9s, 1993). However, in this anticline, the fold-related fractures are controlled by the orientation of inherited extensional faults, resulting in asymmetric fracture networks that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the fold axial trend (Tavani et al., 2011). Consequently, due to the asymmetrical orientation of the fractures and the absence of crosscutting relationships between most of these sets, the timing of deformation has not been entirely constrained. Hence, the main objectives of this contribution are: 1) to appraise the absolute timing of fracturing and the age and duration of fold evolution in an anticline that exhibits well-preserved growth strata that allows us to corroborate the coherence of the geochronological data; 2) to qualitatively evaluate the extent of fluid-rock interaction in fractures; 3) to decipher the origin, distribution and variation of fluids across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline; and 4) to compare our results with those reported in similar compressional settings. In order to address these objectives, we provide field structural data, together with petrographic, geochemical (\u03b418O, \u03b413C, 87Sr\/86Sr, \u039447 and elemental composition) and geochronological (U\u2013Pb ages) analyses of vein cements developed within pre- and syn-folding strata. This robust dataset has been completed with already published data from specific structures of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Labra\u00f1a de Miguel, 2004; Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019). Beyond the regional conclusions, our study provides a well-constrained absolute timing of deformation in an anticline that preserves pre-, syn- and post-folding fractures that do not exhibit a symmetrical orientation with respect to the fold axis, which have important implications for the interpretation of fold-fracture systems. Within this well-constrained structural setting, our study provides new constraints on the duration of fold evolution and further documents the variations and implications of the fluid flow behavior across the anticline during the entire folding event.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pyrenees consist of an asymmetrical and doubly verging orogenic wedge that resulted from the Alpine collision between the Iberian and European plates from Late Cretaceous to Miocene, causing the inversion of previous Mesozoic rift basins and subsequent growth of the orogenic belt (Choukroune, 1989; Grool et al., 2018; Mouthereau et al., 2014; Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Tugend et al., 2014; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). The Pyrenean structure comprises an antiformal stack of basement-involved thrust sheets from the Axial Zone flanked by two oppositely verging fold-and-thrust belts and their related foreland basins (Fig. 1\na and b) (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; S\u00e9guret and Daigni\u00e8res, 1986). The southern fold-and-thrust belt includes a piggy-back imbrication of Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover thrust sheets that have been detached from the Paleozoic basement along Upper Triassic evaporites (Roure et al., 1989; S\u00e9guret and Daigni\u00e8res, 1986). In the South-Central Pyrenees, these cover thrust sheets are, from north and older to south and younger, the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, active from the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, the Montsec thrust sheet emplaced during the Paleocene to late Ypresian, and the Serres Marginals thrust sheet emplaced from Lutetian to Oligocene times (Roure et al., 1989; Verg\u00e9s and Mu\u00f1oz, 1990). The B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet results from the tectonic inversion of the Organy\u00e0 Basin and its tectonic transport to the south. Its front corresponds to an intricate thrust fault zone of more than 40\u00a0km in length that from east to west forms the Narg\u00f3, B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli thrust segments, interpreted as a fault-propagation by Bond and McClay (1995), while growth anticlines formed in its hangingwall: Roca Narieda, Narg\u00f3, B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990). This study focuses on the westernmost section of these growth folds that corresponds to the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Fig. 2\na and b).\nThe complete stratigraphic record involved in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline includes Upper Triassic to Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic rocks and Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic units (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Mencos et al., 2015; Sim\u00f3, 1986) (Fig. 2c). The pre-orogenic sequence includes up to 5\u00a0km of pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift (pre-orogenic) rocks located in the hanging wall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust. The pre-rift sequence, which is up to a few thousand meters thick (Lanaja, 1987; Mencos et al., 2011), crops out discontinuously in the study area and includes Upper Triassic shales and evaporites, which constitutes the main detachment level in the Pyrenees, and Jurassic dolomitic limestones and dolostones. The Lower Cretaceous syn-rift sequence extensively crops out in the hinge of the anticline. This sequence ranges from a few meters to more than 4000\u00a0m thick, and includes an intercalation of basinal marls, marly limestones and limestones (i.e., the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation), which lower part abruptly evolves to platform limestones (the Setcomelles Member) (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002).\nThe upper Cenomanian to lower Santonian post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence is around 800\u00a0m thick and mainly consists of carbonate rocks divided in five sedimentary formations, which in the study area are known as the Santa Fe, the Reguard, the Congost, the Collada Gass\u00f3 and the Sant Corneli Formations (Gallem\u00ed Paulet et al., 1982; Mencos, 2010; Sim\u00f3, 1986).\nThe syn-orogenic sequence is well-exposed in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and includes more than 1000\u00a0m of upper Santonian to Paleocene sedimentary rocks exhibiting growth geometries. These syn-orogenic rocks, which have been dated using biostratigraphy (G\u00f3mez-Garrido, 1987; Mencos, 2010; Mercedez, 2005; Sim\u00f3, 1986), comprise three shallowing upward sequences grading from turbidites and marls into shallow marine, fluvial and continental deposits (Mencos, 2010; Mey et al., 1968). These three sequences belong to the Vallcarga Formation and to the Areny and the Tremp Groups. The Vallcarga Formation (upper Santonian to middle Campanian) mainly consists of hemipelagic marls. The middle part of this formation consists of a slope-toe chaotic unit (i.e., the Puimanyons Member) developed due to the destabilization of the carbonate platform and characterized by growth faulting and olistostrome resulting from basin margin collapse during the growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli (Bond and McClay, 1995; Sim\u00f3, 1986). The Areny Group (late Campanian to Maastrichtian) deposited during the B\u00f3ixols thrust activity and related B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline growth (Bond and McClay, 1995; Mencos et al., 2011; Robert et al., 2018). This sequence mainly consists of shallow marine to coastal deposits. Finally, the Maastrichtian to Paleocene Tremp Group (i.e., Garumnian facies) includes alluvial, fluvial, lacustrine and carbonate deposits.\nThe structure of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet is composite, formed by the large Santa Fe syncline and the two linked and south-verging anticlines of B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli (the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline) (Fig. 2a and b). The surficial expression of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline crops out along more than 40\u00a0km showing a well-defined geometry in its central-western segment that is characterized by a gently dipping (around 40\u00b0) northern backlimb and a subvertical to overturned southern forelimb.\nDuring the inversion of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front, shortening direction has been determined as NNW-SSE (Tavani et al., 2011). This orientation, which is not perpendicular but slightly oblique to E-W trending inverted normal fault, strongly conditioned the orientation of fractures developed during the evolution of this frontal anticline (Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011).\nThe B\u00f3ixols thrust along the forelimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is well preserved, near the villages of B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca (Fig. 2). Contrarily, around the Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is blind and sealed by syn-orogenic deposits and the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols anticline is cut by decametric to kilometric subvertical strike-slip faults (e.g., Nardini et al., 2019) (Fig. 2). The northern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is cut by well-preserved large normal faults displacing Upper Cretaceous carbonate sequences in Montagut and Sant Joan localities. All these fractures record a significant part of the structural and fluid flow histories of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, which preserves both pre- and syn-orogenic deformation.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThis study integrates field, petrographic, geochemical, and geochronological analyses of vein cements and related host rocks from 10 representative localities (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). The field data comprise bedding and fracture dips and dip directions and their crosscutting relationships and kinematics. Such data are plotted in equal-area lower-hemisphere stereoplots to define different fracture systems. Restoration of these fracture systems with respect to the adjacent bedding and estimation of the associated stress orientations have been carried out using Win-Tensor software (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). For analysis of fault kinematics, this software considers the improved Right Dihedron method (Angelier, 1984), which is an inversion technique that under basic assumptions and limitations (Lacombe, 2012), allowed us to calculate paleostress orientations and stress ratios for the different striated faults present in the study area.\nUp to 185 samples of the involved host rocks and all vein cement generations filling the recognized fractures systems have been selected for petrographic, geochemical and geochronological analyses. Around 135 polished thin sections of these samples have been analyzed for petrographic descriptions with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a cold cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope operating at 15\u201318\u00a0kV and 350\u00a0\u03bcA current.\nGeochemical analyses have been applied to vein cements and host rocks in order to determine the origin, distribution and temperature of the vein-forming fluids as well as the extent of fluid-rock interaction. These geochemical data consist of (i) stable isotope analysis of 150 representative samples, (ii) the elemental composition of 69 samples, (iii) the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of 43 samples, (iii) clumped isotope thermometry of 21 samples, the results of which were converted to temperatures by applying the calibration method of (Kluge et al., 2015). Calculated \u03b418Ofluid values are expressed in per mill (\u2030) with respect to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). This study also includes U\u2013Pb dates obtained with a laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICPMS) at FIERCE (Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center, Goethe University). Details on the different methods and procedures can be found in the supplementary material.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStudied localities\nThe studied localities record the deformation history and fluid flow events that occurred in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, ten sampling localities were selected as representative of the different fracture networks as well as the involved host rocks already described in the geological setting. The main characteristics of these localities are described below.\nThe B\u00f3ixols locality (B) is located in the B\u00f3ixols village, next to the axial surface of the anticline. In this locality, the contact between the Lower Cretaceous limestones and marls from the syn-rift sequence and the Jurassic dolomitic limestones from the pre-rift succession has been interpreted as the preserved upper part of the main E-W Early Cretaceous extensional fault (e.g., Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Tavani et al., 2011).\nThe Cal Mestre locality (CM) is located 0.5\u00a0km to the northeast of the B\u00f3ixols village, in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols anticline. In this area, the Lower Cretaceous limestones and marls from the syn-rift sequence are broadly exposed exhibiting a minimum thickness of 2500\u00a0m according to well data (Lanaja, 1987).\nThe Montagut (MGT) and the Sant Joan (SJ) localities are in the northern limb of the anticline, affecting Upper Cretaceous limestones from the post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence. The structure of the Montagut locality consists of relatively well exposed systems of normal, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a lateral continuity of several kilometers (Fig. 3a\u2013c) (i.e., the Montagut fault system). The structure of the Sant Joan locality includes two conjugate sets of strike-slip faults and a different set of normal faults. The latest set is referred in this study as the Sant Joan fault system (Fig. 3c).\nThe remaining localities are located along the frontal region of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and include fractures that cut pre-orogenic depositional units from the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and syn-orogenic units deposited in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet. The B\u00f3ixols thrust has been studied in Abella de la Conca (ABC), Forat de B\u00f3ixols (FB) and Setcomelles (SET) localities (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In Abella de la Conca and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities, the E-W trending and north-dipping B\u00f3ixols thrust offsets subvertical post-rift Upper Cretaceous limestones along the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The Abella de la Conca locality also includes a reduced Upper Cretaceous syn-orogenic sequence. The Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality, located 2\u00a0km southwest of the B\u00f3ixols village, preserves a good exposure that allowed to study the evolution of fractures across the B\u00f3ixols thrust zone in a previous paper (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b) (Fig. 4b). In the Setcomelles locality, between B\u00f3ixols and Sallent villages, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is interpreted as a footwall shortcut of the previous Lower Cretaceous Organy\u00e0 fault. In this area, Jurassic dolomitized limestones juxtapose against Upper Cretaceous limestones (Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002) (Fig. 4c). The Sant Antoni (SA), Orcau (OC) and Coll de Narg\u00f3 (CN) localities are aligned along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, involving Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic sequences showing growth strata patterns (Bond and McClay, 1995; Garrido-Meg\u00edas et al., 1972; Mencos et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2017; Verg\u00e9s and Mu\u00f1oz, 1990). The Sant Antoni locality, next to the Sant Antoni dam, comprises the lowest part of the syn-orogenic sequence integrated in the Vallcarga Fm. (Fig. 4d). The Orcau locality, next to the Orcau village, constitutes the middle part of the syn-orogenic unit integrated in the Areny Group. Finally, the Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality, near the Coll the Narg\u00f3 village, involves the upper part of the syn-orogenic sequence integrated within the Garumnian facies from the Tremp Group. In this area, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is buried and the syn-orogenic deposits are deposited in angular unconformity on the front of the anticline and are affected by conjugated systems of veins and strike-slip faults (i.e., the Coll de Narg\u00f3 faults) (Nardini et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.2\nPetrographic description of host rocks\nIn this section, we summarize the main petrographic features of the studied host rocks. The syn-rift Lower Cretaceous Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation, made up of mudstones with isolated sponge spicules and agglutinated foraminifera (Fig. 5\na), features a dark brown to non-luminescence (Fig. 5b). The lower part of the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Fm (the Setcomelles Member) is formed of wackestones, locally packstones, made up of corals, red algae (Agardhiellopsis cretacea), echinoderms, bryozoans and foraminifera. The moldic porosity is filled with micrite sediment with a geopetal distribution, which indicates vadose environment, and the remanent intraparticle porosity is filled by calcite cement (Fig. 5c). The micrite matrix exhibits a brown to dark orange luminescence, whereas the intraparticle micrite sediment shows an orange luminescence and the cement has a non-to bright yellow zonation (Fig. 5d).\nThe Upper Cretaceous post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence includes five sedimentary formations, which are known as the Santa Fe, the Reguard, the Congost, the Collada Gass\u00f3 and the Sant Corneli Formations. The Santa Fe Fm., including wackestones, locally packstones with calcispheres and planktonic foraminifera, exhibits a very dark orange luminescence. The Reguard Fm. consists of mudstones, locally wackestones, made up of foraminifera (mainly miliolids) and showing a dark brown luminescence. The Congost Fm. is made up of packstones, locally grainstones formed of bivalves, foraminifera, echinoderms, corals, bryozoans and partially to totally micritized components (i.e., peloids) (Fig. 5e). The micritic matrix and the inter- and intraparticle blocky calcite cement are dark brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 5f). The Collada Gass\u00f3 Fm. is formed of grainstones made up of gastropods, bivalves, echinoids, corals, bryozoans, miliolids, peloids, and locally quartz grains. The inter- and intraparticle porosity is cemented by blocky calcite cement, which exhibits a bright yellow luminescence, whereas the skeletal components display a dull to bright brown luminescence. The Sant Corneli Fm. is divided in two members (the Montagut Mb and the Aramunt Vell Mb). The Montagut Mb. consists of peloidal wackestones to packstones with abundant presence of rudists, miliolids, corals, equinoderms and local quartz detrital components. Under cathodoluminescence, these packstones exhibit a dark to bright brown color. The Aramunt Vell Mb. consists of bioclatic grainstones with variable quartz content and abundant presence of miliolids, bryozoans, equinoderms and bivalves. The interparticle calcite cement is blocky and displays a dark orange luminescence.\nThe Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic successions include the Vallcarga Formation, the Areny Group and the Tremp Group (Garumnian facies). The Vallcarga Formation consist of mudstones that are brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 5g\u2013h). The Areny Group, in the study localities, is composed of grainstones made up of peloids, local bryozoans and miliolids, and upward increasing detrital quartz content. The interparticle blocky calcite cement is bright yellow luminescent. The Tremp Group (i.e., Garumnian facies) is constituted of fluvial-alluvial and lacustrine detrital and carbonate rocks. Detrital units include versicolored clays with abundant Microcodium, fine-grained sandstones and polymictic conglomerates. Carbonate units include red nodular mudstones, grey wackestones with charophytes and oncolytic packstones.\n\n\n4.3\nFracture analysis\nThe folded sequence within the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is affected by several fracture sets that include the main reverse, strike slip and normal faults affecting the anticline (the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system and the Sant Joan fault system) and the background deformation (centimetric to metric fractures). We use the term \u201cfracture\u201d or \u201cjoint\u201d to include fractures that show no evidence of shear, and we use the term \u201cfault\u201d to exclusively include shear fractures (Bons et al., 2012). The main fracture and fault characteristics (type, orientation, kinematics, and crosscutting relationships) and their distribution within the anticline are described below.\nThrust faults are important deformation features affecting the frontal part of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (in the Setcomelles, Forat de B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca localities). Thrusts are E-W trending and south verging reverse faults dipping between 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 towards the north. These faults include the main B\u00f3ixols thrust that has been associated with the growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Although most of the B\u00f3ixols fault trace has been buried by syn-orogenic deposits, its frontal ramp crops out between B\u00f3ixols and Sallent villages (Setcomelles locality) juxtaposing Jurassic rocks of the hanging wall with Upper Cretaceous carbonates of the footwall. In this locality, the B\u00f3ixols thrust zone is around 15-m-thick and contains a 2-m-thick fault core characterized by a dark grey to greenish fine-grained foliated gouge featuring well-developed S\u2013C structures that indicate top-to-the S and SSE reverse kinematics.\nIn the Forat the B\u00f3ixols and in Abella de la Conca localities, the B\u00f3ixols thrust displaces, and postdate, the vertical to overturned southern forelimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline generating well-exposed fault zones. These fault zones consist of up to 7\u00a0m thick light grey and fine-grained foliated gouges characterized by well-developed S\u2013C structures forming sigmoidal lenses or imbricated lithons, which are bounded by pressure-solution seams or stylolites striking WSW-ENE. The orientation of these stylolites suggests an NNW-SSE shortening direction, and the presence of striation surfaces on the main slip planes together with the S\u2013C structures also indicate reverse kinematics towards the S-SE. The damage zones, surrounding these fault cores, are characterized by different sets of systematically and randomly-oriented calcite veins exhibiting an increase in vein density from the protolith towards the fault core, as described in Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020b).\nAdditionally, strike slip faults are also important deformation features that have been observed in most of the studied localities affecting the different structural and stratigraphic positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In the Montagut and Cal Mestre localities, WNW-ESE right-lateral strike slip faults cut pre-orogenic units. These faults developed during the strike-slip reactivation of earlier extensional faults due to their favorable orientation with respect to N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction as evidenced by the presence of slickenlines and striae sets showing crosscutting relationships (Martinez Martinez Casas et al., 2019; Nardini et al., 2019; Tavani et al., 2011). In other localities, N\u2013S to NW-SE and less abundant NE-SW strike slip faults are mainly subvertical, regardless of the bedding dips, and show displacements from a few centimeters up to several meters. Deformation associated with these faults is either localized on discrete polished slip surfaces or accommodated along an up to 1-m-thick fault cores formed of brittle incohesive fault rocks. Sub-horizontal slickenlines present on the slip planes indicate pure strike-slip, and locally oblique-slip, kinematics. These faults affect pre-orogenic units in the backlimb (Montagut and Sant Joan localities) and the hinge (Cal Mestre locality) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and syn-orogenic units (Sant Antoni and Coll de Narg\u00f3 localities).\nNormal faults widely occur in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In the pre- and syn-rift sequence (B\u00f3ixols and Cal Mestre localities), normal faults strike WNW-ESE to NW-SE and dip 40\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 towards the NE and SW. These faults include the Organy\u00e0 fault, preserved next to the axial surface of the anticline juxtaposing Jurassic pre-rift and Lower Cretaceous syn-rift sequences, and meter-scale normal faults that only affect the Lower Cretaceous (syn-rift) Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation. In the backlimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, normal faults have been observed around the Montagut and the Sant Joan fault systems (Montagut and Sant Joan localities, respectively) cutting the Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic sequence. In the Montagut locality, metric to decametric NNW-SSE extensional faults dip 50\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 either towards the SW or NE. Deformation associated with these faults is mainly localized in discrete slip planes exhibiting subvertical striae sets or in centimetric fault cores constituted of grey to reddish calcite-cemented breccias. In the San Joan locality, metric to decametric NNE-SSW to NE-SW extensional faults dip around 60\u00b0 towards the NW and SE. These faults present subvertical striae sets indicating dip-slip kinematics and have also been observed in the Santa Fe syncline (i.e., in the north of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline). Finally, WNW-ESE extensional faults dipping between 40\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 towards the NE and SW have been locally observed in the syn-orogenic succession in the Sant Antoni locality and locally in the syn-orogenic sequence from the Abella de la Conca locality.\nBed-parallel slip surfaces are commonly developed between well-bedded layers of marls and marly limestones in the syn-rift sequence (Cal Mestre locality) and the base of the syn-orogenic sequence (Sant Antoni and Abella de la Conca localities) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. These surfaces correspond to centimeter-thick and striated discrete planes cemented by calcite.\nOther mesostructures occurring in most structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline correspond to calcite-cemented fractures (i.e., veins) oriented at high angle with respect to bedding. NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW centimetric vein systems dipping between 50\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 have been observed in the backlimb and forelimb of the anticline (Sant Joan and Coll de Narg\u00f3 localities, respectively) affecting pre-orogenic units. These veins have regular shapes and show openings ranging from 1 to 15\u00a0mm. E-W to WSW- ENE calcite veins are also present in the pre-orogenic unit (Cal Mestre locality) and in the syn-orogenic sequence (Orcau and Abella de la Conca localities). These veins are up to 1\u00a0m long and less than 1\u00a0cm thick. In the Orcau locality, veins with similar NW-SE orientation show crosscutting relationships suggesting development of similar fractures during successive fracturing events.\n\n\n4.4\nPetrographic description of vein cements\nThe petrographic description of the different vein cements from fractures using optical and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopes is summarized in this section and in Fig. 6\n.\nCalcite cements precipitated within faults and related fractures across the B\u00f3ixols-San Corneli anticline are characterized by elongated to fibrous crystals ranging in size from 0.1 to 7\u00a0mm, although most common crystals are less than 2\u00a0mm (Fig. 6a). Luminescence features of these cements are generally very homogeneous and vary from dark brown to bright yellow, being dull orange to dark yellow the most common colors observed under CL (Fig. 6b).\nCements from veins that precipitated in bed-parallel slip surfaces share similar petrographic characteristics throughout the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. These cements, which consist of up to 5\u00a0mm elongated to fibrous calcite crystals arranged parallel to both the vein walls and the bedding surfaces, are dark brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 6c\u2013d).\nCalcite cements precipitated in centimetric to metric non shear fractures are mainly characterized by blocky to elongated blocky crystals ranging in size from 0.2 to 5\u00a0mm and locally displaying mechanical twining (Fig. 6e\u2013f). Elongated blocky calcites have been observed in different veins exhibiting elongation direction perpendicular to fracture walls and indicating the mode I opening of the vein (Bons et al., 2012) (Fig. 6f). Under CL, cements within non-shear fractures display three kind of luminescence colors: (i) dark brown to non-luminescence; (ii) orange to bright yellow; and (iii) a non-luminescent to bright yellow concentric zonation (Fig. 6g\u2013h).\nBesides, it is worth noting two correlations observed between the luminescence features of the vein cements and the structural position of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli fold. First, all cements from fractures present in two localities (Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, which are found in the fold hinge and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, respectively) exhibit a dark brown to non-luminescence. This is the case, for instance, of the veins from bed-parallel slip surfaces explained above (Fig. 6c\u2013d). Second, all cements showing a non-luminescent to bright yellow concentric zonation are found in fractures present in the limbs of the anticline, this is, in Sant Joan and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities as shown in Fig. 6g\u2013h.\n\n\n4.5\nGeochemistry of calcite cements and host rocks\nStable (\u03b418O and \u03b413C) and clumped (\u039447) isotopes, 87Sr\/86Sr ratios and elemental composition of the successive calcite veins and related host rocks are summarized in Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n and in the supplementary data. In order to discuss all the complexity of the geochemical values, the studied calcite cements have been assembled in three groups (Figs. 7\u20139), according to similarities of the main geochemical features:\nGroup 1 includes dark to non-luminescent calcite cements, similar to their adjacent marine host rocks, either the Lower Cretaceous marls of the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation or the Upper Cretaceous marls of the Vallcarga Formation. These cements also show \u03b413C values and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios similar to their adjacent host rocks, which are typical of marine carbonates (Figs. 7 and 8) (Veizer et al., 1999). They are also characterized by Sr contents higher than 1100\u00a0ppm, Mn contents lower than 200\u00a0ppm, and Y\/Ho ratios higher than 50 (Fig. 9). The \u03b418O values of Group 1 cements are similar to or up to 5 \u2030VPDB lighter than those values of their correspondent host rocks (Figs. 7 and 8b). Their geochemistry generally reflects the composition of their host carbonates. Cements from Group 1 are all cements from fractures and faults present in the hinge of the anticline (Cal Mestre locality) and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (Sant Antoni locality). In addition, 9 representative samples of this Group were analyzed to reconstruct the temperature and composition of the fluids precipitating these cements using clumped isotope measurements. In the hinge of the anticline (5 samples), the obtained \u039447 values range from 0.456 to 0.567\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.028, which translates into precipitation temperatures ranging from 36 to 85\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22124.7 to +3.8 \u2030SMOW. In the base of the syn-orogenic deposits from the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (4 samples) the \u039447 values vary from 0.404\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.022 to 0.509\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015, which indicates precipitation temperatures ranging from 59 to 116\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid from +5.3 to +6.5 \u2030SMOW.\nGroup 2 includes cements that show the lightest \u03b418O values, from \u221214 \u2030VPDB to \u22128 \u2030VPDB, which are up to 10 \u2030VPDB lighter than their correspondent host rocks (Figs. 7 and 8b). These cements have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios between 0.7074 and 0.7080 (Fig. 8a\u2013b), and \u03b413C between \u221212 \u2030VPDB and +2 \u2030VPDB, which may either be similar or lighter than those values of their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 7). Additionally, comparing all cements, calcites from Group 2 exhibit low to intermediate Sr contents (between 390 and 2000\u00a0ppm), intermediate Mn contents (less than 700\u00a0ppm), and intermediate Y\/Ho ratios (between 40 and 80) (Fig. 9a\u2013c). All these calcite cements precipitated in large-scale faults and related fractures affecting different sectors of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Eleven representative clumped isotope measurements of Group 2 cements were completed with 4 previously reported measurements in the area (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019) to reconstruct the temperature and composition of the precipitating fluids. Obtained \u039447 values range from 0.413\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009 to 0.529\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, which correspond to precipitation temperatures ranging from 50 to 110\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22124.3 to +4.2 \u2030SMOW.\nGroup 3 of calcites (Figs. 7\u20139) includes cements characterized by a narrow range of the \u03b418O values, between \u22128 and \u22126\u2030 VPDB (Figs. 7 and 8b), and \u03b413C-depleted values, between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02\u2030 VPDB, which are up to 10\u2030 VPDB lighter than their surrounding host rocks (Fig. 7). The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of these calcites, between 0.7073 and 0.7077, are lower than values of their correspondent host rocks but within the range of Cretaceous carbonates, which range between 0.7072 and 0.7079, approximately (McArthur et al., 2012) (Fig. 8a\u2013b). Finally, these cements display the lowest Sr contents (less than 500\u00a0ppm) and Y\/Ho ratios (less than 60) (Fig. 9). Cements from Group 3 precipitated in centimetric to metric-scale fractures in the backlimb (Sant Joan locality) and forelimb (Coll de Narg\u00f3 and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The previous contributions of (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019) also reported the temperature of precipitation and composition of the parent fluids for four cements from Group 3 and these data has been complemented with a new clumped isotope measurement. Obtained \u039447 values range from 0.494\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016 to 0.646\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, which correspond to precipitation temperatures ranging from 40 to 85\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22121.3 to +4.8 \u2030SMOW.\n\n\n\n5\nU\u2013Pb geochronology of fracture-filling calcite cements\nTwenty-three ages were obtained for different fracture-filling calcite cements (Fig. 10\n), varying from Late Cretaceous (79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma) to late Miocene (9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma). These U\u2013Pb ages were acquired for calcite cements from Group 2 (18 out of 23), which precipitated along the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system and other large faults affecting the entire anticline (Fig. 10), and for cements from Group 1 (3 out of 23) and from Group 3 (2 out of 23). These results together with eight previously published dates (Cruset et al., 2020a,b; Haines, 2008) provide a well constrained absolute timing of deformation and fluid flow in the frontal anticline of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (Fig. 10).\nCalcite cements and clay minerals were dated in the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Setcomelles, Forat de B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca localities. At Setcomelles, previously Ar\u2013Ar dating of clays sampled in a fault core, yielded an age of 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0Ma (Haines, 2008), whereas an U\u2013Pb age of 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma was obtained at Forat de B\u00f3ixols (Cruset et al., 2020b). Both dates are older than the new U\u2013Pb age reported in this study for the B\u00f3ixols thrust at Abella de la Conca (36.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0Ma).\nIn the several faults that constitute the Montagut fault system, which affect the Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic sequence at the Montagut locality, we obtained 13 U\u2013Pb dates. These dates present important age variations from the oldest one during the Late Cretaceous at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to the youngest one during the late Miocene at 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma. Using this dataset, which has been completed with two previously published dates of the area, we report the formation and\/or reactivation of normal faults and related fluid flow at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, 48.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u00a0Ma to 43.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma, 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to 16.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0Ma and 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). Therefore, the Late Cretaceous date (79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma) is: (i) the oldest obtained age in this contribution and, (ii) older than the first age documented for the B\u00f3ixols thrust (71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0Ma, Haines, 2008). Ages for the Organy\u00e0 fault and other pre-orogeny fractures were not obtained in this study. In the same way, at the Montagut locality, we document the formation and\/or reactivation of strike-slip faults during precipitation of calcite cements at 58.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma, 45.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma to 37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0Ma and 27.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0Ma. The precipitation of calcite cement in strike-slip faults during the Lutetian, coincides with the formation of similar strike-slip faults in other localities, according to the age of their related cements at 43.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0Ma (Sant Joan locality) and 45.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7 (Sant Antoni locality).\nAt the Sant Joan locality, we did not obtain ages for the Sant Joan fault system. However, we measured two dates for calcite veins at 67.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0Ma and 65.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma, which precipitated in metric fractures in this locality. The former age has a mean squared weighted deviate (MSWD) of 10.6. As this value is higher than 2, it could indicate a mixing of ages, an open system, or an incomplete initial equilibration of the Pb isotopes (Rasbury and Cole, 2009).\nOther obtained ages in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline account for the background deformation represented by fracture systems at different scales and studied at distinct localities. In this line, we document the formation of layer-parallel slip surfaces at 61.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.8\u00a0Ma in Cal Mestre Locality. Similarly, we also report the formation and\/or reactivation of meter-scale fractures during the Late Cretaceous to Oligocene, according to precipitation of calcite cements at 67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0Ma, 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, 44.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma to 43.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma and 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10).\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSequence of deformation and age and duration of fold evolution\nIn this section we stablish the sequence of fracturing based on field data and structural observations and provide absolute age constraints from the U\u2013Pb dating of calcite veins in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline.\nFirstly, we use relative chronological relationships to determine whether the studied fracture and fault systems developed prior, during or after the main folding stage. It must be highlighted that fractures in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline are controlled by the presence of inherited extensional structures, resulting in fractures that do not preserve a symmetrical orientation with respect to the local fold axis (Nardini et al., 2019; Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011). Therefore, the approaches used to determine the relative age of fracture development are: (i) the crosscutting relationships between different fracture and striae sets; (ii) the relation between fracture orientation and bedding attitude; and (iii) the restriction of fractures to specific pre- and\/or syn-orogenic units. Following these assumptions, we summarize the fold evolution in four stages of deformation, which are in line with previous studies describing the evolution of folds in fold-and-thrust belts (Amrouch et al., 2010; Beaudoin et al., 2015, 2020; Casini et al., 2011; Lacombe et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015):\nPre-orogenic extension: the WNW-ESE to NNW-SSE normal faults in the B\u00f3ixols and Cal Mestre localities only affect pre- and syn-rift (pre-orogenic) units and are consistent with the NNE-SSW extensional regime that predates the Pyrenean compression (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990). Accordingly, these faults have previously been associated with an Early Cretaceous rifting in the area (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002).\nLayer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stage: during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, slip directions provided by fault orientations and related slickenlines are consistent with a N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction (Fig. 10), which agrees with the regional tectonic transport direction in the Pyrenees (Choukroune, 1989; Macchiavelli et al., 2017; Srivastava et al., 1990). The estimated stress field calculated for the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust evidences a SSE transport direction, compatible with the estimated N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction, and a subhorizontal maximum principal stress. The orientation of the conjugate NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, showing a subhorizontal \u03c31, is compatible with the shortening direction reported for the B\u00f3ixols thrust (Fig. 10), and the similar petrographic and geochemical features of the calcite cements found within these conjugate fractures and the B\u00f3ixols thrust accounts for a synchronous development. Besides, opening fractures with similar NNW-SSE orientations developed during successive fracturing events, as evidenced by crosscutting relationships between their associated vein cements (e.g., Fig. 6e). These opening fractures likely developed with a horizontal least compressive principal stress and thus, during compression (Anderson, 1951). Previous studies already reported the formation of NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW fractures during the main folding stage in the western termination of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Shackleton et al., 2011). These NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW fracture orientations have been interpreted as controlled by the regional shortening direction and by inherited extensional structures, respectively (Tavani et al., 2011).\nOther deformation structures, interpreted as developed during the layer parallel shortening and main folding stages include the formation of bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, which is indicative of flexural-slip commonly associated with the main folding stage (Tavani et al., 2011, 2017) as well as the strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults that developed during the pre-orogenic deformation. This reactivation, which is supported by the presence of overprinting striae sets exhibiting oblique-slip and strike-slip kinematics and by the coexistence of two calcite cements in the same fractures, was likely caused due to their favorable orientation with respect to the shortening direction during inversion. In the same way, fractures exhibiting an E-W orientation that is parallel to the fold axis have been associated with local extension due to strata bending, as interpreted other anticlines elsewhere (Beaudoin et al., 2015).\nFold tightening stage: this late deformation stage is represented by fractures that are still consistent with a NNW-SSE shortening direction but are characterized by a constant orientation independently of the bedding dips, and by large faults offsetting the already folded beds of the anticline. These features are indicative of a fold tightening stage (Amrouch et al., 2010; Beaudoin et al., 2020; Casini et al., 2011; Lacombe et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015). At this stage, the ongoing shortening is expected to be oriented at a high angle with respect to bedding and the resulting deformation has been interpreted as accommodated by: (i) the formation of thrust faults (B\u00f3ixols thrust in the Forat de B\u00f3ixols and the Abella de la Conca localities), offsetting the steeply dipping forelimb of the anticline; and (ii) strike-slip faults exhibiting subhorizontal striae sets and recording a subhorizontal maximum principal stress regardless of the bedding dips across the anticline (Fig. 10).\nPost-folding normal faulting: normal faults displace already folded beds in the backlimb of the anticline (the Sant Joan fault system and subsidiary faults around the Montagut fault system) in the Sant Joan and Montagut localities, respectively. As this extensional faulting postdate strata tilting, these faults have been attributed to a post-folding extensional stage that could be associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli structure (Mencos, 2010). As reported in other areas elsewhere, positive uplift may induce gravity-driven extension that mainly affects the limbs of anticlines (Morley, 2007; Tavani et al., 2014, 2015).\nBeyond this, U\u2013Pb chronology of the successive vein cements allowed us to refine the absolute timing of vein development, which is in line with the sequence of deformation interpreted from the structural analysis, and to link the four deformation stages in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline with the regional deformation of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet during the evolution of the South-Central Pyrenees. The collected samples of the normal faults interpreted as pre-orogenic deformation have not given measurable ages. Thereby, we provide absolute U\u2013Pb age constraints for the layer parallel shortening and subsequent folding stage, for the late stage of fold tightening and for the post-folding normal faulting, as summarized below.\nThe succession of U\u2013Pb ages measured in calcite veins that precipitated in fractures attributed to the layer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages range from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). These ages are coeval with the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata deposition along the southern flank of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Thus, corroborating the formation of: (i) conjugated NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, (ii) bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, (iii) E-W bed-perpendicular fractures trending parallel to the fold axis, and (iv) strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front during Late Cretaceous to Paleocene times. This is also consistent with previous estimates placing the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols trust sheet and its eastern equivalent structure, the Upper Pedraforca thrust sheet, from 70.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 to 55.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma (Cruset et al., 2020b).\nAdditionally, a sample from the NNW-SSE Montagut fault system, in the region of relay between the anticlines of B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli, has given an age of 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (middle Campanian). This age is the oldest associated with a normal fault in the study region and therefore synchronous with the well-preserved Late Cretaceous growth strata deposits at the SW end of the Sant Corneli anticline. Indeed, NW-SE normal faults have also been observed deforming Upper Cretaceous syn-orogenic sediments in the Sant Antoni locality, in the western end of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The formation of the former NNW-SSE normal faults is consistent with the formation of extensional structures oriented parallel to the shortening direction (Tavani et al., 2011). The development of the later NW-SE faults is consistent tectonic instability and basin margin collapse during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and the initial stages of fold growth (Bond and McClay, 1995; Guillaume et al., 2008; Shackleton et al., 2011).\nThe U\u2013Pb ages ranging from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma postdate the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata that fossilizes the B\u00f3ixols structure (Fig. 10). This corroborates the formation of thrust faults offsetting the forelimb of the anticline (B\u00f3ixols thrust in the Forat de B\u00f3ixols and the Abella de la Conca localities) and strike-slip faults across the fold during the tightening of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet including its frontal B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline in Eocene and Oligocene times. This fold tightening is therefore coeval with the tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet to the south over the basal thrust of the South-Central Pyrenean Unit during a period that is characterized by maximum shortening rates (Cruset et al., 2020b; Grool et al., 2018; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). During this period, we also report the formation and\/reactivation of NNW-SSE normal faults, NW-SE strike slip faults and E-W to WNW-ESE opening veins, suggesting that these structures successively developed during the entire folding event (Fig. 10).\nU\u2013Pb dating of normal faults interpreted as post-folding structures reveals their formation at 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). Coeval deformation has been documented in the SE Pyrenean thrust sheets through the reactivation of thrust faults and the growth of collapse normal faults dated by means of U\u2013Pb geochronology (Cruset et al., 2020b).\nTo sum up, we interpret the evolution of fractures in the study area as a record of the pre-orogenic deformation, developed previously to 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11\n). Our data also reveal the layer parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages, which lasted at least from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front (Fig. 11). The late stage of fold tightening from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma, coeval with the tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet to the south over the South-Central Pyrenean Unit basal thrust. Therefore, the absolute dating of mesostructures presented in this study not only corroborates the sequence of deformation interpreted from the field and structural data but also allowed us to provide new constraints on the age and duration of the entire folding event (Lacombe et al., 2021). Thus, we suggest that the layer parallel shortening and folding substages lasted for about 14 Myr, whereas the late fold tightening had a duration of about 28 Myr. This indicates that the entire folding event lasted at least 42 Myr (Fig. 11). These interpretations are in line with recent studies estimating the duration of fold growth in the Pyrenees and elsewhere using direct dating of vein cements (Lacombe et al., 2021).\nBesides, it is worth nothing that this study evidences the continuous formation of similar fracture and fault systems throughout the folding process. Likewise, we report the precipitation of calcite cements with similar petrographic and geochemical features that developed during different deformation stages. Therefore, we conclude that without the absolute timing constraints provided by U\u2013Pb geochronology, different fractures and different fluid flow events that occurred in the several stages of fold evolution would potentially be interpreted as occurred coevally during the same substage of folding. This, therefore, has important implications for the prediction of fracture development and associated fluid flow migrations.\n\n\n6.2\nOpen vs closed fluid behavior and relative extent of fluid-rock interactions\nThe presence of different calcite vein generations developed during the structural evolution of the study area, as well as the wide range of U\u2013Pb ages and isotopic and elemental composition of the vein cements, evidence a complex evolution of the fluid system throughout the entire deformation history.\nIn the Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, present in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, respectively, the calcite cements associated with successive episodes of fracturing and vein formation (i.e., Group 1 calcites) do not record significant changes in the cement composition through time (Figs. 7\u20139). Accordingly, all cements from this Group 1 have similar \u03b413C values to their associated carbonate host rocks (Llu\u00e7\u00e0 and Vallcarga Formations, respectively), which in turn yield typical marine values (Fig. 7) (Veizer et al., 1999). The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the vein cements are similar to those ratios of local host rocks, which also reflect the composition of contemporaneous seawater (LOWESS curve in Fig. 8a). Indeed, the low Mn content of calcites Group 1 and related host rocks, responsible for their dark to non-luminescence, together with their high Sr content (Fig. 9a\u2013b) and high Y\/Ho ratios (Fig. 9c), reveal to be close to the elemental composition of marine carbonates derived from well-oxygenated seawater (Popp et al., 1986). Therefore, the similar petrographic and geochemical features of all calcite cements and host rocks from Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities indicate very low water-rock ratios (i.e., diffusive flow) and precipitation of successive calcite cements in a relatively closed\/rock-buffered system during different fracturing events (Boutoux et al., 2014; Hurai et al., 2015; Vandeginste et al., 2012). In this scenario, the slight \u03b418O-depletion of calcites Group 1 (Fig. 7a), with respect to host rocks and typical marine values, indicates variation in fluid temperatures, from 36 and up to 116\u00a0\u00b0C, and locally in the fluid composition, from \u22124.7 to +6.5 \u2030SMOW, during different events of calcite cement precipitation, as revealed by clumped isotope data. Variations in temperature are expected during different stages of deformation linked to the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In contrast, the positive \u03b418Ofluid-values, measured in most calcites from Group 1 (Fig. 8c), indicate the presence of formation waters, which is consistent with a scenario mainly involving evolved marine fluids likely trapped in the surrounding Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates present in Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, respectively. Locally, the negative \u03b418Ofluid-values, measured in two cements from Group 1 (Fig. 8c), likely indicate the infiltration of meteoric waters during the main folding and late fold tightening stages (Fig. 10). However, the similar isotopic and elemental signature between these two cements, the other cements from Group 1 and the adjacent marine host rocks indicate that the fluids precipitating in these veins migrated at relative low rates to equilibrate with the adjacent sedimentary formations. Therefore, we suggest that calcites Group 1 precipitated from formation, likely marine-derived fluids, and locally from meteoric waters, the composition of which was buffered by the adjacent Cretaceous marine carbonates.\nThe geochemical data of calcite cements from Group 2, precipitated in decametric to kilometric faults (the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system, the Sant Joan fault system) and related fractures, evidence a different scenario than that of Group 1 cements. Calcites from Group 2 generally display the more depleted \u03b418O values with respect to those of Group 1 and exhibit up to 10 \u2030VPDB lighter values than their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 7). This \u03b418O-depletion is related to the relative high temperature of precipitation, up to 120\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that the fluids precipitating calcites Group 2 migrated rapid enough through fault zones to avoid efficient isotopic equilibration with surrounding host rocks (Beaudoin et al., 2011). On the other hand, the scattered \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of Group 2 cements (Figs. 7\u20138), their variable enrichment in Mn contents (Fig. 9b), and their differing luminescence characteristics could indicate that the precipitating fluids had distinct fluid origins (marine, connate and\/or meteoric) and that they interacted with different sedimentary units (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Vandeginste et al., 2012). The variable origin of the precipitating fluids is recorded in the \u03b418Ofluid, which yield values, between \u22124.4 and\u00a0+\u00a04.3 \u2030SMOW, that is between the range of meteoric, marine and formation waters. Similarly, the Y\/Ho ratios of Group 2 of cements indicate a variable degree of siliciclastic and marine influence (Fig. 9c). As large-scale faults affect all stratigraphic sequences involved in the anticline, from Jurassic marine to Paleocene continental host rocks, such variation may result from the interaction between the vein-forming fluids and marine (high Y\/Ho ratio) or continental (low Y\/Ho ratio) rocks (Bau, 1994; Nardini et al., 2019). Accordingly, we interpret that calcites from Group 2 precipitated from fluids that did not equilibrated geochemically with the host rocks. As this group mainly concerns large faults and related fractures such as the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system, the Sant Joan fault system, among others, these large fractures acted as efficient conduits for fluid migration during their formation at different stages of the deformation history.\nCements from Group 3 precipitated in centimetric to metric scale fractures in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, where Upper Cretaceous post-rift (pre-orogenic) marine carbonates are widely exposed. The isotopic signature of these cements, ranging between \u22128 and \u22126 \u2030VPDB for \u03b418O and between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02 \u2030VPDB for \u03b413C, fall within the range of meteoric carbonates (Pujalte et al., 2009; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Veizer, 2005), although with varying influence of the marine host rocks as evidenced by the positive \u03b413C values of some cements (Fig. 7). The meteoric origin of cements from Group 3 is supported by their 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, which are lower than those values of their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 8a), and by the elemental composition of these cements, yielding the lowest Sr contents with respect to other cements and host rocks. The low Y\/Ho ratios, which indicates the influence of terrigenous sediments (Bau, 1994), and their common CL zonation (Fig. 6), which points to oxidizing-reducing fluctuations, are again characteristic features of the meteoric environment. At outcrop scale, clumped isotopes reveal a progressive increase in precipitation temperatures, from 40\u00a0\u00b0C to 80\u00a0\u00b0C (Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality) and from 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 85\u00a0\u00b0C approximately (Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality), as well as an enrichment in \u03b418Ofluid, from \u22121.8 to +5.9 \u2030VSMOW and from \u22124.2 to +2 \u2030VSMOW, respectively (Fig. 8c). This fact indicates a continuous shift in the fluid composition, from meteoric to evolved meteoric fluids due to water-rock interactions at increasing temperatures during deformation. Therefore, these geochemical features indicate that the fluid system associated with metric fractures that developed in the limbs of the anticline, was open to the input of meteoric fluids, which geochemistry was influenced by the surrounding Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates.\n\n\n6.3\nSpatio-temporal variation of fluids across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline\nIn this section, we discuss the distribution and variations of fluids in the distinct structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline.\nThe host-rock buffered fluids from which calcites Group 1 precipitated characterizes the paleohydrological system in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits along the southern flank of the fold, where Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities are located, respectively (Fig. 12\n). In the hinge of the anticline (Cal Mestre locality), the Lower Cretaceous mudstones and marls from the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation have a minimum thickness of 2500\u00a0m (Lanaja, 1987). Due to the expected non-permeable character of this unit and its considerable thickness, the small-scale fractures (up to several meters long) occurring in this locality, likely represented poorly efficient conduits to connect different hydro-stratigraphic reservoirs and to prevent isotopic equilibration between fluids and host rocks. A similar rock-buffered fluid behavior has been observed in the core of the el Guix anticline in the Ebro foreland basin, where the \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of fracture-filling calcites are in geochemical equilibrium with their adjacent host carbonates (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2000). Contrarily, in the crestal and shallower domains of anticlines, the fluid system is often the opposite. Examples of this are the Puig-reig anticline, also in the Ebro foreland basin, and the Pico del \u00c1guila anticline in the Sierras Exteriores (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016). These authors concluded that large faults and well-connected fracture networks that developed in response to outer arc extension at fold hinges during fold growth facilitated the opening of the fluid system and the percolation of meteoric fluids in disequilibrium with their adjacent host rocks. These observations, together with that of this study, reveal the compartmentalization of fold structures during deformation.\nIn the base of the syn-orogenic deposits (Sant Antoni locality), the Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones from the Vallcarga Formation were deposited during the early contraction and initial growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Ard\u00e8vol et al., 2000). Therefore, the local origin of the fluids in this domain is consistent with the marine setting of deformation that likely affected recently deposited and poorly lithified sediments (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007).\nFluids with limited geochemical interactions with adjacent host rocks from which calcites Group 2 precipitated characterize the fluid system associated with large-scale faults and related fractures, which affect the different structural and stratigraphic positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and developed throughout its whole deformation history (Fig. 12). The development of these large fracture systems facilitated the transfer of fluids between different hydro-stratigraphic units decreasing the extent of interaction between fluids and host rocks, as has already been documented in the frontal domain of the anticline. In this line, according to Nardini et al. (2019), large strike-slip faults from Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality acted as transfer zones for the migration of deeper Late Cretaceous connate waters to shallower non-marine sediments of the Paleocene Garumnian facies. Likewise, the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality acted as an efficient longitudinal conduit for the migration of deep formation waters also derived from Cretaceous carbonates (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). In both examples, these large faults enhanced connectivity between different sedimentary units, allowing heated formation fluids to migrate upward through fault zones with limited equilibration with adjacent rocks (Nardini et al., 2019; Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). These fluids were likely expelled due to vertical compaction linked to thrust sheet emplacement and\/or tectonic horizontal shortening (squeegee-type fluid flow) during continuous compression (; Machel and Cavell, 1999; Oliver, 1986; Roure et al., 2010; Smeraglia et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Trav\u00e9 et al., 1997, 1998; Vandeginste et al., 2012).\nFinally, meteoric and evolved meteoric waters from which calcites Group 3 precipitated characterizes the fluid system in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, where Forat the B\u00f3ixols, Coll de Narg\u00f3 and Sant Joan localities are located (Fig. 12). Meteoric waters generally infiltrate at high structural reliefs such as the crestal domain of anticlines (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016). However, in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline meteoric fluid percolation was mainly recorded in the fold limbs, and locally in the fold hinge, because most of the crestal domain was eroded synchronously with folding (Tavani et al., 2011). On the other hand, the geochemical and geochronological data of some calcite cements from Group 3 set the initial infiltration of meteoric fluids during the Maastrichtian, during formation of their related fractures at ca. 67\u201365\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). This fluid flow event coincides with the transition from marine to continental conditions, during the progressive uplift of the structure, coevally with sedimentation of the non-marine continental Garumnian facies (Tremp Group) from Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene (Garc\u00e9s et al., 2020; Plaziat, 1981). Therefore, the emersion of the B\u00f3ixols structure has been recorded by the fluids that migrated through fractures during deformation. This scenario of meteoric fluid infiltration during the main folding stage and during the change from marine to continental conditions have also been reported in other studies focused on the evolution of fold-fluid systems (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Nardini et al., 2019; Trav\u00e9 et al., 1998, 2007).\nIn conclusion, our data reveal that the fluid flow history and the extent of fluid-rock interaction varied at the several structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and according to the age and nature of their stratigraphy and the involved fracture networks. This indicates a compartmentalization of the fluid system (Fig. 12). Thus, in the hinge of the fold, at least around Cal Mestre locality, and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits (Sant Joan locality), the fluid system was locally derived and\/or well equilibrated with the host rocks, revealing a high extent of fluid-rock interaction. These local\/rock-buffered fluids were basically evolved marine and\/or connate waters derived from the adjacent Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates, although influences of meteoric waters were also locally present. Contrarily, along large faults, affecting different parts of the anticline, and in the fold limbs, the paleohydrological system was different. Large faults acted as conduits for the migration of fluids with limited chemical interactions with adjacent host rocks, suggesting that these faults have been efficient conduits for upward fluid flow during their development in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The fold limbs registered the infiltration and evolution of meteoric waters with varying degrees of fluid-rock interactions at increasing temperatures during deformation (Fig. 12). Therefore, our data suggest that in the studied anticline the relative scale and distribution of fracture networks together with the involved stratigraphy were the main controls on the source, the distribution of fluids and the degree of fluid-rock interactions during deformation.\n\n\n6.4\nScale of fluid flow and comparison with other compressional settings\nIn this section, we evaluate the scale of fluid flow in rocks forming the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and compare our results with other Pyrenean structures and other worldwide compressional belts. The B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet corresponds to the uppermost and oldest emplaced structure of the southern-central Pyrenean cover thrust units. Therefore, the structural position of this thrust sheet, detached along the Upper Triassic evaporites and above Lower Triassic detrital sediments of the Buntsandstein and the Paleozoic basement, allows us to assess the possible input of external fluids derived from these three potential reservoirs. In a previous section, we concluded that advective fluid flow was linked to the presence of major fault zones (including the B\u00f3ixols thrust) and associated fractures, which acted as preferential fluid flow pathways. Therefore, the geochemical signature of calcite cements precipitated in these fractures (Group 2 calcites) provide evidence on the relative scale of fluid flow and the fluid circulation depth. Thus, during precipitation of Group 2 calcites, a maximum temperature of around 120\u00a0\u00b0C was obtained from clumped isotopes in calcites precipitated in fractures associated with the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality (Fig. 8c) (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). Assuming a normal geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007), these temperatures would have been reached at 3\u20134\u00a0km depth. Considering the thickness of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (around 5\u00a0km thick), such temperatures imply circulation of fluids along fault zones that were originated in the deeper parts of the sedimentary cover. Indeed, the \u03b418Ofluid of this group of cements, yielding maximum values of +5.5 \u2030VSMOW, indicate the presence of formation waters, as has been explained before, and discard the input of basement-related fluids such water derived from and\/or equilibrated with metamorphic rocks (Sheppard, 1981). In the same way, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the vein cements documented in this study are (1) within the range of marine carbonates (LOWESS curve in Fig. 8a), (2) within the range of synkinematic veins precipitated in the sedimentary cover (i.e., 87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0<\u00a00.710) (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020a), and (3) significantly lower than values of cements precipitated from fluids that have interacted with Triassic evaporites or with Paleozoic basement rocks (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020a). All these observations indicate that the fluid system in the study area was restricted to the scale of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and rule out the input of external fluids derived from the underlying Triassic detachment, from deeper cover units such as the Buntsandstein or from the Paleozoic basement. An exception arises for the cement precipitated in the B\u00f3ixols thrust-related deformation at the Setcomelles locality, which exhibits the most radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr ratio in this study, similar to Upper Triassic values (Fig. 8a). Therefore, fluids derived from Upper Triassic evaporites acting as a main detachment of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet could have locally infiltrated the paleohydrological system, as has also been reported in other salt-detached Pyrenean structures (Crognier et al., 2018; Cruset et al., 2020a; Lacroix et al., 2011; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007).\nThe results presented in this study also reveal that the frontal anticline (the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline) of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet shares a common fluid flow behavior with other worldwide compressional structures above evaporitic detachments. In these structures, the paleohydrological system only involves fluids sourced above the detachment levels, which may act as a lower boundary for the fluid system, preventing the input of fluids from deeper parts of the compressional belt. This fluid flow scenario in the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet is similar to that of: 1) worldwide detachment folds (Beaudoin et al., 2014); 2) other south Pyrenean structures detached in Triassic and Eocene evaporitic units such as the Pico del \u00c1guila and El Guix anticlines (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2000), the Monte Perdido and Abocador thrusts (Cruset et al., 2018; Lacroix et al., 2011), and the Upper and Lower Pedraforca thrust sheets (Cruset et al., 2020a); 3) other worldwide detached structures such as the Sierra Madre Oriental (Fischer et al., 2009; Lefticariu et al., 2005) and the Central Appalachians (Evans et al., 2012). Contrarily, in the absence of evaporites, a previous study highlighted that the fluid system is open to migration of hydrothermal, likely basement-derived fluids into the overlaying sedimentary cover (Beaudoin et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nOur field and analytical data allowed to date and to analyze the relationships between fluid flow and fold evolution across different structural domains of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline as summarized below.\n\n1.\nThe successive fracture-filling calcite cements identified in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline were assembled in three calcite groups according to petrological and geochemical data. Group 1 includes calcites with similar petrographic and geochemical features with respect to their host carbonates (i.e., non-luminescent calcite cements with \u03b413C values and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios typical of marine carbonates); Group 2 comprises calcites with the lightest \u03b418O values, down to \u221214 \u2030VPDB, and the highest temperature of precipitation (up to 120\u00a0\u00b0C); and Group 3 includes calcites with \u03b418O from \u22128 to \u22126 \u2030VPDB, \u03b413C down to \u221210 \u2030VPDB and the lowest Sr contents.\n\n\n2.\nThe geochemistry of Group 1 cements indicates an essentially closed and\/or rock buffered fluid system in the Early Cretaceous sequence from the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the upper Santonian to middle Campanian syn-orogenic sequence along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust.\n\n\n3.\nThe geochemistry of Group 2 cements indicates an open fluid system along the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut and the Sant Joan fault systems evidencing that these large faults acted as conduits for the upward migration of formation fluids, which evolved from different fluid origins. Group 3 cements indicate the presence and evolution of meteoric waters in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Meteoric fluids likely infiltrated at high structural reliefs during fold growth.\n\n\n4.\nTwenty-three new U\u2013Pb dates were measured in different sets of fracture-filling calcite cements in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline presenting a wide range of ages from Late Cretaceous at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to late Miocene at 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma. These age variations are in line with the sequence of deformation inferred from field and microstructural observations.\n\n\n5.\nTen U\u2013Pb ages measured in calcites from fractures attributed to the layer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages range from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, coeval with the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata deposition along the southern flank of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. This confirms the development of (i) conjugated NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, (ii) bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, (iii) E-W bed-perpendicular fractures trending parallel to the fold axis, and (iv) strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front during Late Cretaceous to Paleocene times.\n\n\n6.\nFifteen ages that range from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma and measured in calcites from fractures that cut already folded beds indicate the late tightening of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline during Eocene and Oligocene periods, coeval with the southern tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet in the hanging wall of the South-Central Pyrenean Unit.\n\n\n7.\nThe Miocene ages from 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma from normal faults that displace already folded beds in the backlimb of the anticline have been attributed to a post-folding extensional stage that could be associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli structure.\n\n\n8.\nThe U\u2013Pb geochronology allowed us to calculate the entire duration of folding for \u223c42 Myr with layer parallel shortening and folding for about \u223c14 Myr, whereas its tightening lasted around 28 Myr.\n\n\n9.\nThe major B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Coll de Narg\u00f3 strike-slip faults and the Montagut fault system acted as preferential pathways for the upwards migration of fluids during compression, whereas background fracturing registered the presence of formation fluids that highly interacted with their adjacent host rocks. The paleohydrological system in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline was restricted above the thick Upper Triassic evaporitic detachment level and thus comparable to other detached fold and thrust belts as the Central Appalachians and Sierra Madre Oriental as good examples.\n\n\n\n\n","91":"","92":"","93":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAn urgent need exists to maximize economic benefits and reduce environmental hazards in the evaluation of seal integrity in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrocarbon extraction from ultra-low permeability shale reservoirs by multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. To achieve this, a better evaluation of formations\u2019 mechanical properties is required, of which it is particularly imperative to elucidate creep behavior to improve the reliability of geomechanical modeling and to optimize resource utilization (Rutqvist, 2012). Laboratory measurements have shown that time-dependent deformation is a paramount intrinsic behavior of sedimentary rocks (Chang and Zoback, 2009; Hagin and Zoback, 2004), and creep compaction occurs more frequently and significantly than instantaneous mechanical behavior (Chang and Zoback, 2009). In the petroleum industry, creep behavior affects long-time behavior of reservoirs, especially for shales (Slim et al., 2019a, b). For instance, hydraulic fracturing operations could suffer from decreases, both in fracture surface area and permeability, as hard proppant particles penetrate into the rock (Alramahi and Sundberg, 2012; Wilcox et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), triggering a loss in efficiency of the fracture network in conducting fluid from the rock matrix, and inducing observed declines in production rates and miscalculations of formation productivity (Hagin and Zoback, 2004; Slim et al., 2019a, b; Sone and Zoback, 2014). Therefore, correct measurement of creep behavior of reservoir rocks is of great significance for long-term strength and seepage characteristics evaluation (Shi et al., 2020).\nFor organic-rich shale formations composed of multiphase materials and complex nanopore structure (Liu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019), their creep properties might be more significant. The organic phase drives creep behavior in composite materials, as it affects energy dissipation due to deformations (Slim et al., 2019a, b), and its mechanical properties are markedly different from other inorganic minerals in terms of dynamic microscale crack propagation (Zhao and Zhang, 2020). In addition, the maturity of the organic matter will further impose an effect on the mechanical behavior and texture of the formation rocks, making the underground mechanical properties extraordinarily complex and highly heterogeneous (Zargari et al., 2013).\nThermal maturity is the extent of temperature\u2013time driven reactions (Mani et al., 2017) to indicate the organic matter evolution and hydrocarbon generation stage of source rock. With the progress of burial, the temperature and overlying pressure continue to increase, which promotes the production of oil and gas from kerogen. The structure and properties of kerogen itself also change continuously with the increase of thermal maturity. The commonly used index to characterize thermal maturity is vitrinite reflectance. In general, the higher is the vitrinite reflectance, the higher is the thermal maturity of organic matter. Since there were no higher plants prior to the Devonian, it is impossible to determine maturity by measuring the reflectance of vitrinite. The alternative method is to first measure the reflectance of fossils, such as asphalt or graptolite, and then use the empirical formula to convert it into vitrinite reflectance (Bertrand, 1990; Bertrand and Heroux, 1987; Jacob, 1989). Many researchers have explored the impact of organic matter maturity on its elastic properties through the application of nanoindentation and modulus mapping by atomic force microscope (AFM) (Eliyahu et al., 2015; Emmanuel et al., 2016; Fender et al., 2020b; Goodarzi et al., 2017; Khatibi et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2012a, b; Li et al., 2018; Shukla et al., 2013; Zargari et al., 2013; Zeszotarski et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2020). However, despite the wide use of such method for mechanical measurements of organic matter in shale recently, the majority of prior studies aim to capture the force curves by instantaneously acting on the sample to obtain more of the apparent elastic properties based on the framework of Hertzian contact assumption (Fischer-Cripps, 2004). Indeed, few experiments considered characterizing its time-dependent behavior in this process, in which experiments are generally supposed to be performed in a load-hold-unload penetration cycle.\nCompared to conventional creep experiments that apply unconfined or triaxial compression tests using core plugs (Gupta and Mishra, 2017; Sone and Zoback, 2014), nanoindentation may also provide a convenient way to assess the time-domain measurements of organic matter with the application of a step load and subsequent measurement of depth as a function of time (creep method). In fact, some researchers have achieved specific results in the study of penetration of hard proppant particles into rock (Fischer-Cripps, 2004; Slim et al., 2019a, b). The spatial resolution of the nanoindenter-based static loading method, however, is typically within the micron-rather than the nano-scale range (Dokukin and Sokolov, 2015), and error can be introduced during instantaneous approximation when measuring nano-sized organic particles (Efremov et al., 2020). Another nondestructive method, which calculates the storage and loss modulus of the materials through applying oscillatory displacement or force (Fischer-Cripps, 2004) in AFM, can avoid the abovementioned problems, as well as high time-consumption. In addition, it is more compatible with adhesive and soft materials compared with AFM-contact resonance technology (Yablon et al., 2012).\nIn this research, to elucidate trends in elasticity and viscosity of organic matter through different thermal maturities correlated with chemical structure variations, AFM-based nanoscale dynamic mechanical analysis (AFM-nDMA) was carried out to capture the storage modulus and loss tangent (also known as tan\u03b4 or loss tan, which represents dissipated energy to total stored energy in the material) (Fischer-Cripps, 2004) combined with micro-Raman tests. The influence of geochemical features is also discussed based on the characterization results.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nGeological setting of samples and preparation\nIn this research, samples were retrieved from shale cores belonging to the Yanchang (mainly Chang 7 oil-layer group) and Shanxi Formation of the Ordos Basin in China. The Ordos Basin developed on a Paleozoic stable cratonic marine sedimentary basin to form as a Mesozoic inland lacustrine basin, while the Yanchang Formation formed with semi-deep to deep lacustrine deposits (You et al., 2020). During the period, the climate was warm and humid, and abundant plant nutrients enabled lacustrine organisms to multiply and provided an essential material basis for developing sedimentary organic matter. Moreover, the deep freshwater environment was mainly dominated by an anoxic and reducing environment, providing critical conditions for preserving organic constituents (You et al., 2020). Macerals, which are microscopically-recognizable organic constituents, can be classified as vitrinite, inertinite, and liptinite according to characteristic physical and chemical properties (Chaudhuri, 2016). The optical classification of macerals in the petroleum field draws on the concepts and methods of coal petrology. In the Yanchang Formation, macerals are primarily humic-sapropelic type and mature (Ji and Wu, 2007). In contrast, the Shanxi Formation is largely shallow lacustrine and swamp microfacies deposits (Wu et al., 2022). The macerals of kerogen in this formation are in the post-mature stage, and are mainly humic-amorphous and normal vitrinites.\nThe test used shale cuboids of 7 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mm that were cut from the shale cores, and prepared as larger faces parallel or perpendicular to the bedding planes. Mechanical polishing and argon ion milling (Leica EM TIC 3X, accelerating voltage 5\u00a0kV) were performed on the larger faces (test faces) to decrease surface roughness and for adequate identification of organic matter, and the surface roughness after ion polishing can be lower than 100\u00a0nm of a 25\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcm test area under the topography scanning test of AFM.\n\n\n2.2\nCharacterization methods\n\n2.2.1\nVitrinite reflectance test and Rock-Eval pyrolysis\nSince vitrinite serves as one of the primary kerogen macerals in source rocks, and it changes predictably with heating (over geological time periods) (Levine and Davis, 1984; McCartney and Teichm\u00fcller, 1972), measurement of vitrinite reflectance (VR\n\no\n, the percentage of light reflected from the surface of polished vitrinite) (Su\u00e1rez Ruiz and Crelling, 2008) levels is considered to be one of the most robust of many techniques available for determination of a sample's thermal maturity (Hackley and Lewan, 2018). In addition, the reflectance values increase systematically with increasing thermal maturity. In this study, the ion-polished samples were placed on the sample stage of a photomicrometer (QDI 302, CRAIC; DM4500P, Leica) (a combination of an optical microscope and a spectrophotometer) and brought into focus under 50x magnification of an oil immersion objective lens. The spectrophotometer is used to complete the reflectance measurement in a certain area, while the optical microscope can assist in observation. Therefore, organic types and thermal maturity are determined according to image contrast and reflectance values.\nRock-Eval (RE) pyrolysis is another well-established and cost-effective screening method for the rapid characterization of organic matter in sediments, and provides information on kerogen type and maturity by gradually heating samples under an inert atmosphere. In this study, 100\u00a0mg gravel-sized particles of each sample are loaded into pyrolysis crucibles (YQ-VIII, Haicheng Petrochemical Instrument Factory) and pyrolyzed under helium by following the Chinese national standard \u201cGB\/T18602-2012\u201d. Hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide evolved from organic matter during heating, and are measured over time to form the Rock-Eval pyrogram, which yielded certain parameters, such as total organic carbon (TOC) and pyrolysis temperature (Tmax), at which the maximum amount of hydrocarbon yields from cracking of the kerogen (Espitali\u00e9 et al., 1977). In general, Tmax increases linearly with the degree of maturation of the organic matter, thus giving a rapid estimate of the thermal maturity of sedimentary basins (Barker, 1974; Dellisanti et al., 2010; Espitali\u00e9 et al., 1977). However, it is worth mentioning that Tmax is partly determined by the type of organic matter (Dellisanti et al., 2010). For the details of vitrinite reflectance and Tmax describing the level of thermal maturation, one can refer to the work of previous scholars (Peters, 1998).\n\n\n2.2.2\nMicro-Raman analysis\nThe chemical structure of organic matter is gradually varied during thermal evolution. Raman spectrum is highly sensitive to molecular vibrations and symmetries of chemical bonds of carbon materials, and thus it is used in this study to characterize the alteration of the chemical structure of organic matter at different thermal evolution stages. Micro-Raman test can execute in-situ non-destruction measurements of the samples with a combination of optical observation, positioning and Raman spectrum analysis (L\u00fcnsdorf, 2016), thus avoiding extracting organic matter from shale rocks by mechanical and chemical purification methods. Researchers have successfully correlated Raman features with thermal maturity (Khatibi et al., 2018; L\u00fcnsdorf, 2016). In this study, samples were put into a micro-Raman microscope (DXRxi, ThermoFisher), and then tested micro-areas were found through coordinate calculation and comparison of optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The macerals were detected with 532\u00a0nm excitation, and the exposure time was 0.05\u00a0s. Through the experimental test, the laser power was set to be 0.5\u00a0mW to prevent the laser from damaging the organic matter.\n\n\n2.2.3\nAFM-nDMA measurements\nAFM-nDMA completes dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) by making the piezo scanner heave sinusoidally at a specific frequency, and detecting the oscillation deflection over time generated by the AFM probe when in contact with the tested samples with predefined force (Fig. 1\n). Harmonic signals can describe the amplitudes of the scanner and the deflection oscillation of the probe, and the viscosity properties of the sample are reflected in the phase shifts:\n\n(1)\n\n\nZ\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n=\n\nZ\n0\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\u03c9\nt\n+\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nD\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n=\n\nD\n0\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\u03c9\nt\n+\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nwhere Z\n\n0\n, \u03b8\n\nz\n, D\n\n0\n, and \u03b8\n\nd\n are the amplitudes (nm), and initial phases of each oscillation signal of the scanner and the probe at angular frequency \u03c9\u00a0=\u00a02\u03c0f (Hz), respectively.\nThe complex dynamic stiffness S* (Radmacher et al., 1993) can therefore be written with the quotient of oscillatory force (determined from probe deflection with a given cantilever spring constant) and sample indentation (determined as the difference between scanner displacement and probe deflection):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nS\n\u2217\n\n=\n\nS\n\u03b1\n\n+\ni\n\nS\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n\n\nK\nc\n\n\nD\n0\n\n\ne\n\ni\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZ\n0\n\n\ne\n\ni\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\nD\n0\n\n\ne\n\ni\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere K\n\nc\n is the cantilever spring constant in N\/m. The real and imaginary parts of S* can then be expressed as storage stiffness (S\n\n\u03b1\n, N\/m) and loss stiffness (S\n\n\u03b2\n, N\/m), respectively (Pittenger et al., 2019):\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nS\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\n\n\nK\nc\n\n\nD\n0\n\n\n\nZ\n0\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\nD\n0\n\n\/\n\nZ\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\ncos\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\nD\n0\n\n\/\n\nZ\n0\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n(\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nS\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n\n\nK\nc\n\n\nD\n0\n\n\n\nZ\n0\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\ncos\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\nD\n0\n\n\/\n\nZ\n0\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n(\n\nsin\n\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\nd\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b8\nz\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsequently, storage modulus E\n\n\u03b1\n (elastic part, GPa) and loss modulus E\n\n\u03b2\n (viscous part, GPa) can be determined from storage and loss stiffness, respectively.

The ultimate test area of interest was then determined by topography scanning. Pre-calibrated probes with rounded tips (RTESPA-525-30, tip radius: 30\u00a0nm) were used in this experiment to ensure that the contact area was a constant, and thus the accuracy of the measurements was maximized by avoiding errors brought by the spherical tip assumption (Fischer-Cripps, 2004). This 525-series tip was more than sufficient for testing the modulus range of organic matter (Emmanuel et al., 2016).\nWhen testing, it should be noted that the interaction between the tip of the atomic force microscope and the sample must be carried out under a low and well-controlled load. Specifically, it was necessary to ensure that the preload exerted by the tip on the sample could press a deformation of 2\u00a0nm\u201320 nm (preload: 1.5\u00a0\u03bcN). For such deformation, the strain generated by the organic matter is sufficiently small and the stress or deformation field generated in the test will not be affected by the substrate or minerals (Geng et al., 2005; Hay et al., 1998; Miyake et al., 2006; Neugirg et al., 2016). On this basis, we then applied a harmonic disturbance with a minimal displacement through the Z-scanner (modulation force: 3.5\u00a0mV; hold time: 400\u00a0ms) and monitored the deflection vibration of the tip on the surface through the laser signal. The difference between the Z-scanner's amplitude and the tip's amplitude reflects the amplitude of the deformation of the sample. Based on the above experimental parameter settings, this deformation amplitude is generally controlled within 10% of the overall deformation and is sufficient to provide viscoelastic information.\nIn addition, the modulation frequency was set at 90\u00a0Hz. It should be noted that 90\u00a0Hz is mainly used here, which is the standard frequency that Bruker's nDMA technology can use for measurement when performing mechanical characterization of viscoelastic materials. The measurement at this frequency can avoid the 2nd harmonic interference. In the future, more detailed research can be done on the mechanical behavior of organic matter at different frequencies and temperatures so that, combined with the time-temperature superposition principle (Seitz and Balazs, 1968), the test frequency can be optimized to approximate the natural mechanical properties of the samples at the high-temperature formation environment when testing at room temperature. In general, however, the AFM-nDMA technique provides us with low-frequency testing options, and thus more selectivity than mechanical testing methods limited to high frequencies (Pittenger et al., 2019). After the tests, the sapphire standard sample was scanned to achieve calibration of the mechanical results. Raman spectroscopy analysis and helium ion microscope (HIM) observation were performed after all mechanical characterizations, considering that the energy control in these experiments might cause some damage to the organic matter.\n\n\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\n\n3.1\nOrganic type and thermal maturity\nThrough the photomicrometer and rock pyrolysis experiments, this experiment completed the maturity test of nine groups of samples and the classification of organic matter types, and at the same time determined the location of the test micro-zones containing different macerals. Since the Tmax peaks in pyrolysis tests of the over-mature samples were not obvious in Rock-Eval analysis, we can only infer with the assistance of literature that the kerogens in our samples were mainly type II and type \u2162 for Yanchang and Shanxi Formations, respectively (Ji and Wu, 2007; Qiu et al., 2021). Table 1\n presents a summary of organic matter properties. From the test results, the total organic carbon (TOC) values varied from 0.96\u00a0wt% to 6.80\u00a0wt% and the vitrinite reflectance of the nine groups of samples ranged from 0.998% to 2.814%, covering the mature to post-mature stages of organic matter evolution. The nine groups of samples exhibited a trend of increasing thermal maturity as depth increased. However, due to the small number of test samples in this study, the general correlation between thermal maturity and buried depth was not further investigated.\n\nFig. 2\n shows the optical microscope and SEM images of different macerals in the samples. During the experiment, the oil immersion objective lens made the structure and protrusions of the organic matter more obvious. It could be seen that, although they were all organic matter distributed in the same area, the characteristics of the three organic matter types were entirely dissimilar (Fig. 2a). Under the oil immersion objective lens, the inertinite tended to appear grayish-white with positive protrusions. In contrast, vitrinite was medium gray, and its protrusions were not prominent, while bitumen was further deepened. However, it was more difficult to distinguish them according to morphology and contrast under the SEM compared with the oil immersion objective lens (Fig. 2b), but some defects that developed in the mature bitumen could be seen more evidently. Surprisingly, we also found a group of ultimate products of organic matter evolution - graphite, whose color was even brighter than inertinite in optical pictures (Fig. 2d). The appearance of graphite provided an important reference for the subsequent mechanical characterization. The reflectance values of different macerals in the same group of shale samples were tested, and it was found that bitumen's reflectance was smaller than that of vitrinite in general, while that of inertinite was the largest. Taking sample Y4 as an example, the measured reflectance range of bitumen was 0.63%\u20130.76%, and the vitrinite reflectance ranged from 0.75% to 1.51%. In comparison, inertinite varied from 1.37% to 3.74%.\n\n\n3.2\nAFM-nDMA results\nAmong the nine sets of shale samples with different maturity levels, a total of 233 test micro-regions were selected for this test. Fig. 3\n shows the trend of changes in the values of storage modulus and loss tangent as the reflectance of the measured organic matter varied, by a resolution of 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 pixels of 25\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcm areas for nDMA surface scanning testing with the assistance of positioning information provided by optical microscope (Fig. 3a) and SEM (Fig. 3b). The results revealed that the organic phase is potentially the weakest component in shale and, as the reflectance increased, the storage modulus (Fig. 3d) representing elasticity gradually rose, while the loss tan (Fig. 3c) representing viscosity exhibited a downward trend. Ultra-high-resolution imaging (Fig. 3e) performed by a helium ion microscope (HIM) (Orion NanoFab, ZEISS) showed that there were no obvious pores in the measured areas of organic matter, indicating that the mechanical results were not affected by the microstructure changes caused by the development of pores. Simultaneously, it was found that the samples with high maturity were prone to develop micro-cracks. Such viscoelasticity evolution process revealed that organic matter is a more polymer-like material at a low maturity exhibiting more ductile behavior; whereas, at high maturity, it revealed more moderate brittleness like other inorganic brittle minerals (e.g., quartz and feldspar). In the performance of fractures propagation, the over-matured organic phase was prone to abrupt breakdown with a relatively flat fracture surface, while the micro-fracture mechanisms at a lower maturity stage tended to be in a process of toughening (Zhao and Zhang, 2020).\nIn order to obtain more representative statistical results, batch tests on selected micro-regions were conducted using 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016 or 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08 dot points in the central area of each organic matter region. Furthermore, the average values of storage modulus and loss tan of the lattice results were adopted to represent the viscoelasticity of the corresponding micro-area. Except for the contaminated areas and those that were accidently lost during the test, 208 effective areas were obtained and classified as vitrinite, inertinite, or bitumen. After completing the nDMA test, the average value of vitrinite reflectance on each sample was utilized to characterize its maturity. It can be seen that (Fig. 4\n) at the same maturity, inertinite generally had the highest modulus, while vitrinite and bitumen were less stiff. From the perspective of viscosity, the loss tan of inertinite was the lowest, followed by vitrinite, and that of bitumen was the highest. As the maturity increases, it will have a certain impact on the mechanical properties of organic matter. As far as the maturity range of the studied samples is concerned, there is a specific positive correlation between elasticity and maturity, while viscosity has a certain negative correlation with maturity. However, the trends in different maturity stages were distinct. In the mature stage, the mechanical indexes varied more drastically with maturity, and the correlation appeared to weaken when transitioning to the post-mature stage. When the vitrinite reflectance increased from 1.02% to 1.43%, the average storage modulus of vitrinite increased from 5.67\u00a0GPa to 7.54\u00a0GPa, by 33%, and the loss tan dropped from 0.133 to 0.092, by 31%. The modulus increased to 9.30\u00a0GPa when R\n\no\n varied from 1.43% to 2.81% (an increase of 23%), and loss tan decreased to 0.088 (by 4%). Bitumen also presented a similar trend. Interestingly, the storage modulus of inertinite even showed an overall decreasing trend considering the entire maturity range studied, which might be due to differences in the storage conditions and biological causes of the organic matter itself or changes brought about by the development of the internal structure; as a consequence, more detailed experiments are needed to explain this phenomenon. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the number of samples, in the test of this paper, we did not observe the general law of difference in the modulus of organic matter on samples with similar maturity but different bedding directions, which may require further study.\nIt can be seen that the mechanical properties and variation trends of different macerals have individual differences, indicating the difficulty of drawing meaningful conclusions in low data-volume cases without classifying organic matter. Obviously, the composition of the macerals is highly complicated, and different organizations will also propose dissimilar classification schemes. For example, based on the classification method implemented in this research, according to the optical pictures of vitrinites, some vitrinites can be further divided as telinite (in the condition that the cell structures of the plant were preserved and still recognizable) (Fig. 2c) and collinite (structureless vitrinite) (Tissot and Welte, 1984). Compared with collinite at similar maturity levels, viscosity values of telinite are weaker among vitrinite, although modulus values are in the same range. Such a result is consistent with the biogenesis of collinite (formed from cellular tissues with substantial biodegradation and strong gelification). In the experiment, we also tested graphite (R\n\no\n\u00a0=\u00a07.83%) (Fig. 4b). The results showed that the loss tan was reduced to 0.0054, and its storage modulus reached 67\u00a0GPa, which is within the range of values obtained by other researchers in graphite modulus tests (30.9 GPa\u2013561.2\u00a0GPa) (Landry et al., 2018; Lokajicek et al., 2011), and it is also in accordance with the trend summarized above. Indeed, it can be seen that graphite is basically in a pure elastic state at this maturity level.\n\nTable 2\n compares the experimental data in this study with previous work. Previous investigations on similar issues mostly used nanoindentation and the AFM-QNM method only for elastic mechanical testing, and did not identify the macerals of kerogen. In addition, the data volume is limited, and thus it is not easy to perform effective analysis. Therefore, this study chooses to further expand by twice the experimental amount of 114 test areas in the work of Zhao et al. (2020). We further expanded the range of maturity and studied the change law of the viscosity, making the conclusions drawn more statistically significant. The expansion of the studied maturity range was also concluded similarly to that of Emmanuel et al. (2016), i.e., when the vitrinite reflectance changes at a lower maturity, the modulus of kerogen increases more significantly. The data obtained from previous work are displayed in Fig. 5\n, which shows that the test results of this study are in a comparable range.\n\n\n3.3\nMicro-Raman analysis\nRaman results can assist to explain the mechanical changes from the perspective of chemical composition. In this study, the Raman spectra of the three macerals in different micro-regions were successfully obtained, which Zhao et al. (2020) failed to achieve. It can be found that the Raman spectrum of these three types of organic matter have two pronounced characteristic peaks with the baseline subtraction pretreatment method (L\u00fcnsdorf, 2016) on the Raman spectrum (Fig. 6\n). One of the peaks is the D band (approximately 1350\u00a0cm\u22121), reflecting the material defects and disordered structure; the other is the G band (near 1600\u00a0cm\u22121), derived from the plane structure of carbon materials. As a more disordered structure is ascribed to an increase in the number and\/or the size of sp2-hybridized clusters (Petrova et al., 2011), the intensity ratio (IR) of the D peak to G peak (D\/G) can be utilized to characterize the level of disorder in graphene (Childres et al., 2013; Ferrari and Robertson, 2000), which indicates the degree of graphitization. Therefore, a lower IR indicates a higher degree of graphitization with fewer defects and disordered structure. Fig. 7\na shows the normalized Raman results of the intensity of the macerals under seven groups of VR\n\no\n. It can be seen that as the reflectance increases, the IR gradually decreases, indicating that the degree of graphitization exhibits an increase. In considering heterogeneity, Fig. 7b, c, and 7d present more reliable averaged IR values of different macerals on each sample. With rising maturity, the degrees of graphitization of the three macerals present an overall gradually increasing trend coinciding with the rise in the proportion of modulus; whereas, the vitrinites exhibit relatively lower graphitization under the same maturity. Graphitization variation, however, is no longer evident at the metagenesis stage (2% < VR\n\no\n < 4%). Therefore, we could infer that during catagenesis (0.5% < VR\n\no\n < 2%), the long-chain aliphatic structure in kerogen or bitumen is continuously decomposed to short-chain gas hydrocarbon compounds, and leads to a more ordered aromatic dominance structure with fewer defects (Tissot and Welte, 1984), which might be the driver for the mechanical reorientation and result in pronounced brittleness. Such observations are in accordance with conjectures made in earlier studies (Fender et al., 2020a, b; Khatibi et al., 2018; Ungerer et al., 2015; Vandenbroucke and Largeau, 2007). Regarding the metagenesis stage, since most of the side chains and groups that can be broken almost disappear, the organic matter is further polycondensed into carbon-rich residual substances, and the original evolution law of mechanical properties begins to weaken. In contrast, the enhancement of brittleness leads to the internal derived microcrack structure, which may partly counteract the modulus resultant from the ordering structure (Wu and Firoozabadi, 2020) (Fig. 8\na, b, and 8c).\nThe conclusions drawn from this work have some similarities with the research of Fender et al. (2020), in which they used the AFM QI\u2122 technique to study the mechanical properties of coal macerals, and they demonstrated an apparent trend in which coal macerals appeared to become stiffer and more normally distributed when evolving with maturity. This means that the law that the mechanical properties of macerals vary with the deepening of the evolution degree is also applicable in coal and shale reservoirs. As the mechanical properties of coals and shales are the first-order control on the feasibility of CO2 injection and long-term storage within most conventional and unconventional targets (Armitage et al., 2011), the discovery in our works can enable us to evaluate what kind of formation evolution degree can achieve the better effect for CCS. For example, Fender et al. (2020) found that differential swelling is more likely to occur in immature coals, and it is preferable to target mature coals for CCS. Our study further supplements the law of mechanical evolution, i.e., in the over-mature stage, the brittle nature of the macerals is more prominent, and thus it is more prone to brittle fracture resulting in microcracks, which is also a problem that needs to be considered in CCS. These findings will assist to improve microscale geomechanical models for fracture tip propagation and better evaluate the risk to seal integrity in CCS.\nMoreover, kerogen type may pose specific impacts. Kerogen in the Shanxi Formation with high maturity is primarily type III according to literature (Qiu et al., 2021), which contains mostly condensed polyaromatics and oxygenated functional groups with minor aliphatic chains compared with other samples (mainly type II kerogen). Consequently, the unification of kerogen types should be included in future studies. In addition, pyrobitumen is a common and vital type of organic matter in the oil window (L\u00f6hr et al., 2015), which is characterized geochemically with bitumen. Due to the limitation of the experimental method of the photomicrometer observation, we did not further classify bitumen for research. It is necessary to differentiate pyrobitumen for further advanced studies in future experiments.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nIn this study, the influence of geochemical features on the viscoelasticity of organic matter was investigated by a chemo-mechanical combined characterization method, which provides a comprehensive and statistically-referenced perspective for evaluating time-dependent deformation of gas shale formations and assessing the suitability of reservoirs for CCS. The results revealed that organic type and thermal maturity have a significant impact on the micromechanical properties of organic matter in shale. With increasing maturity, kerogen would produce oil and natural gas under the influence of temperature and pressure, and its aromaticity and the degree of graphitization would continue to increase, which was confirmed by the Raman results. Furthermore, in terms of micromechanical properties, the storage modulus gradually increases while the viscosity exhibits a downward trend, suggesting that the organic matter become more brittle, and it may be easier to generate micro-cracks under external forces. Therefore, the characterization of viscoelasticity of organic matter by combining geochemical features at the nanoscale offers the opportunity to identify relationships and understand phenomena which macroscale analyses cannot capture due to resolution limitations. These findings indicate that the design of hydraulic fracturing and homogenization modeling needs to further combine the influence of depositional environment and maturity information, because these factors are closely related to the mechanical and structural properties of organic matter, which serve as vital parts of shale reservoirs.\n\n\nData availability statement\nThe data used in this paper are available through the following link: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/7wh8nfyf9c.1.\n\n","94":"","95":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Phanerozoic tectonic history of the Chukchi shelf records a complex, multiphase history of deformation in Arctic Alaska. We document here the importance of structural inheritance in understanding this rich history. Located northwest of the Alaska North Slope, the U. S. Chukchi shelf comprises almost 200,000\u00a0km2 with present-day bathymetry less than \u223c60\u00a0m. The area of interest is limited to the region north of the Herald Arch thrust system, east of the U. S. \u2013 Russia maritime boundary, south of the North Chukchi Basin, and west of the Alaska coastline (Fig. 1\n).\nPrevious work in the Chukchi shelf (Sherwood et al., 1998, 2002; Kumar et al., 2011; Homza and Bergman, 2019) link the stratigraphy of the Chukchi shelf to that of the better-studied North Slope, where four tectonostratigraphic megasequences are recognized (Lerand, 1973; Hubbard et al., 1987; Bird, 2001, Fig. 2\n). The Devonian and older Franklinian megasequence constitutes a transition from passive margin to foreland-basin sedimentation, culminating with significant fold-and-thrust belt development (Sherwood, 1994). The Mississippian-Triassic Ellesmerian megasequence documents a transition from continental rifting to form the Hannah Trough to passive margin and sag-basin development (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). The Beaufortian megasequence represents a fundamental shift in tectonics in the area during Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting and formation of the North Chukchi and Canada Basins (Hubbard et al., 1987; Houseknecht and Bird, 2004; Hutchinson et al., 2017; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019a). The Brookian megasequence represents a change in provenance and foreland basin deposition from Early Cretaceous (Barremian-Aptian) on in response to Chukotka and Brooks Range orogenesis (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019b; Lease et al., 2022). It is the tectonism associated with these megasequences, as well as superimposed Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic contraction and extension local to the Chukchi region, that drove the ubiquitous structural inheritance present in the Hanna Trough.\n\n\n2\nStructural inheritance\nIt is well known that older deformation can influence subsequent deformation. Implicit in this concept of structural inheritance is that events are temporally distinct with a period of inactivity separating episodes of deformation (Holdsworth et al., 1997). Perhaps the most straightforward type of inheritance is classic fault reactivation in which later fault movement is localized on older faults as a result of decreased material strength (Byerlee, 1978; Handy, 1989) and fluid reactions in the fault zone (Wintsch et al., 1995). This can occur at the individual fault scale through the crustal scale, such as along the Alpine fault in New Zealand, where multiple ages of deformation in the same zone have been documented (White and Green, 1986). Commonly, interactions with pre-existing fabrics act to nucleate later deformation in a more distributed fashion, such as the influence of late Paleozoic basement fabrics on Cenozoic rifts in the Upper Rhine Graben in Germany (Schumacher, 2002).\nStructural inversion (Glennie and Boegner, 1981; Bally, 1984; Cooper and Williams, 1989; Buchanan and Buchanan, 1995) constitutes a particular type of structural inheritance whereby the sense of motion on faults, generally dip-slip, changes over time. While a period of tectonic quiescence is not mandatory, a change in far-field stress is required. The archetype example of inversion on discrete structures occurs as reverse faulting along earlier normal faults. This reactivation forms distinctive asymmetric fault-related folds with long back limbs and short front limbs (Williams et al., 1989). In the extreme, these inverted structures can be so asymmetric that the front limbs are thought of as distinct structures separate from the basement uplift, such as the monoclines in the Colorado Plateau, even though they are clearly tied to the overall, larger contractional uplift (Bump, 2003). Structural inversion is not simply conceptualized within the context of individual structures but also on a regional scale (Tari et al., 2020), for example, the full basin inversion of the Uinta Mountains during the Laramide orogeny (Hansen, 1986). Likewise, it is well known that the many older rift basins form the loci of later orogenic belts, such as in the Pyrenees (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Teixell et al., 2018). In these cases, attenuated continental crust serves to focus later contraction (Jackson, 1980). Whether at the local or regional scale, the later uplift in strata above a regional datum was termed positive inversion by Glennie and Boegner (1981).\nIn contrast, negative inversion (Glennie and Boegner, 1981) is the result of early contraction followed by later extension, resulting in subsidence below a regional datum. This is less commonly documented in the literature for discrete structures, perhaps because older thrust faults generally are not at a favorable orientation to resolve significant shear stress during later extension. Imbrication associated with thrust belts however can cause faults to steepen and thus be in more favorable orientations for later changes in the far-field stress (Tari et al., 2021). At the largest scale the concept of negative inversion encompasses extensional orogenic collapse (Dewey, 1988) due to crustal thickening that causes the lower crust to weaken and act as a region of later crustal extension. In some mountain belts detachment horizons in extension likely reactivate older contractional detachments. This is well documented in mountain belts such as the Cenozoic Cordillera of North America (Bally et al., 1966; Constenius, 1996). Repeated inheritance with different structural styles has been recognized in certain mountain belts, such as the control that the extensional Mesozoic Montmell fault in the Catalan Coastal Range, Spain had on Paleogene contractional and Neogene extensional fault systems (Mar\u00edn et al., 2021). Similarly, basement structures have been shown to be reactivated multiple times, such as in offshore Norway (Phillips et al., 2016).\nThere are several ways to identify structural inheritance in seismic reflection data. 1) As discussed above, multiple periods of motion on faults, whether inverted or simply reactivated, are a clear indication of structural inheritance. Coupled with growth strata and multiple unconformities, these are unambiguous indicators of multiple events or styles. A particularly compelling example is the concept of a null point in positive inversion structures, below which there is a normal sense of throw, and above a reverse sense (Williams et al., 1989). 2) Map-view deformational patterns of different ages that have parallel trends are suggestive of reactivation. Holdsworth et al. (1997) termed these \u201cgeometric similarity\u201d inheritance, and point out that when such parallelism of orientation is solely used they may not be reliable indicators of reactivation. Nonetheless, this criterion is useful when orientations with clear spatial overlap are used in conjunction with documented local reactivation of structures to extrapolate to a regional extent of reactivation. 3) Less obvious, but useful for recognition of inversion, are distinctive fault and fold geometries in cross section that differ from expected style. These shapes include the asymmetric positive inversion folds, but also, low-angle, steepening-bend normal faults that occur with negative inversion structures. The utility of these geometries is elaborated on later. Again, these are indirect indicators, and some independent temporal constraint is needed, such as growth strata or unconformities, to document multiple events regionally.\nWe show that every type of structural inheritance outlined above has occurred in the Chukchi Sea area over its complex Phanerozoic tectonic history. We use several seismic-reflection profiles to demonstrate that the tectonic evolution and present tectonic features of the area are better understood within the context of structural inheritance, both at the scale of individual structures and at the broader, basin scale. This framework is relevant to petroleum exploration in this underexplored area, as well the tectonics of the Arctic in general.\n\n\n3\nDatabase and methods\nThis report summarizes selected results from a regional seismic interpretation and mapping study of the subsurface of Arctic Alaska conducted over several years. Approximately 100,000 line-km of reprocessed 2D, time-migrated, seismic reflection lines constitute the primary data available for the Chukchi shelf. Well control is from six exploration wells (Fig. 1), with the deepest penetrated strata the Carboniferous Lisburne Group of the Ellesmerian megasequence (Fig. 2) in the Popcorn, Crackerjack, and Diamond wells (Sherwood et al., 2002). Thus, regional ties to deeper strata have relied on a broader, integrated, regional study of subsurface data that includes the North Slope and Beaufort Sea shelf. In the Arctic Alaska region, data availability includes several 100,000 line-km 2D, and 19 regional 3D seismic datasets, along with hundreds of exploration wells, including nearly 100 penetrations of the pre-Mississippian Franklinian megasequence (Fig. 3\n). These provide indirect constraints on pre-Mississippian strata in the Chukchi region.\nRegional interpretation was conducted using standard seismic interpretation methods with particular emphasis on regional unconformities. Our nomenclature for these is similar to that of Homza and Bergman (2019), with slight modifications and simplifications. The pre-Mississippian unconformity (PMU), marking the top of the Franklinian megasequence delineates inferred pre-Mississippian strata and potentially igneous and metamorphic rocks from younger strata. This surface may contain uppermost Devonian strata above it, but for simplicity we chose to refer to this as the PMU, with analogy to the well penetrations on the North Slope and Beaufort shelf (Fig. 3), where no known pre-Mississippian strata sit above this regional unconformity. The Permian unconformity (PU) defines the top of the lower Ellesmerian megasequence, and the Jurassic unconformity (JU) marks approximately the top of the upper Ellesmerian megasequence but also comprises part of the lower Beaufortian. The Lower Cretaceous unconformity (LCU) is established nearly at the top of the Beaufortian megasequence. The Cretaceous-Paleogene unconformity (KPU) separates Cretaceous and Tertiary strata (Fig. 2). In places, erosion has resulted in composite unconformities, which cut through multiple megasequences. For example, the PMU shown in Fig. 3 represents the top of the Franklinian megasequence, even though on parts of the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms, Brookian strata rest directly on Franklinian and thus that surface also represents the LCU and all older unconformities at these locations. Key mapping surfaces tied to wells, where penetrated, and correlated in seismic data throughout the Chukchi shelf include these five regional unconformities shown in Fig. 2, the approximate top of the Endicott Group in the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence, and the base and top of an acoustically distinct succession in the lower part of Franklinian megasequence. Details of diagnostic criteria for these horizons are discussed below.\nIn addition to interpreting offset reflectors, faults were recognized using the principles of fault-related folding (Suppe et al., 1992; Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Shaw et al., 1997, 2005). These principles recognize fault-cutoff geometries and defined dip domains (regions of homogenous dip) to delineate fold geometries. From these the underlying fault geometries can be inferred that are compatible with fault-related folding equations, and thus structural balancing concepts. Parts of some complex, inherited structures were modeled with the program fbfFor (Connors et al., 2021), which follows the principles of fault-bend folding to produce balanced, kinematic, sequential forward models. The concepts of structural inheritance outlined above, namely the sense of fault offset on multiple horizons, analysis of growth strata and unconformities, regional map patterns, and diagnostic structural styles, were used to infer multiple deformation episodes.\nWith the exception of Fig. 4\n, seismic images are shown with approximately no vertical exaggeration for the deeper reflective section, which is the main focus of this report. The average seismic velocity in the Chukchi shelf for the deeper section is approximately 4400\u00a0m\/s TWTT, based on Grantz et al. (1994) and proprietary industry data. Images displayed with a time axis shown with this average velocity will in general approximate a 1:1 section for the deeper section. Such displays have internal deviations from this, and will likely be modestly vertically exaggerated in the shallower section (up to \u223c1.5:1), but result in time sections that are as close as possible to undistorted. This allows for a more accurate representation of the true structural geometries depicted in these data, in order to understand the complex deformation present. Lateral velocity variations are generally gradual in the Chukchi shelf. One exception is a minor salt diapir west of the Popcorn well, where pullup is present in the time-migrated section as displayed in Fig. 4 at offset 90\u00a0km.\n\n\n4\nNeoproterozoic-early Paleozoic passive margin development, and Devonian folding and thrusting\nA seismic transect across the central Chukchi shelf (Fig. 4) shows that shallower reflectors are mainly continuous across the shelf, whereas deeper reflectors truncate against a less reflective section in angular discordance. In the Chukchi Platform and central Hanna Trough, a prominent, deep reflector separates a weakly reflective to seismically quiescent section from an overlying clearly reflective section. We interpret this as the PMU at the top of the Franklinian megasequence, based on seismic similarity and many well ties to that unconformity beneath the North Slope and Beaufort shelf (e.g., Houseknecht and Connors, 2016). Major structural features of the region are shown in a time surface of the PMU in Fig. 3. These features include the Hanna Trough, a substantial structural low bounded by adjacent highs, the Chukchi Platform to the west, the Arctic Platform to the east, and the North Chukchi high to the north. The present-day depression of the PMU within Hanna Trough grades to the south into the Colville foredeep, a structural low associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene Brookian orogeny (Houseknecht, 2022). Homza and Bergman (2019) defined the Hanna Trough with respect to the limit of the syn-rift Carboniferous Endicott Group. This corresponds to the structural highs listed above, and extends to the south to a latitude of approximately Point Lay (Fig. 3; Homza and Bergman (2019) their Fig. 10).\nWhile the PMU is the deepest surface that can be unambiguously mapped regionally, deeper reflectors are observed locally, and these inform interpretations of the early tectonic history recorded in the Chukchi shelf. The deepest strata that can be correlated beyond individual seismic lines form a nearly isopachous succession defined by two moderate-to high-amplitude reflectors at the top and base in an otherwise transparent to low-amplitude succession on the east side of the transect shown in Fig. 4 (east of offset 220\u00a0km). No well penetrations of this succession are known and Grantz et al. (1982) interpreted it as sedimentary or metasedimentary strata based on lateral reflector continuity and postulated it to be early Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic in age (their \u201cPzpCs Unit\u201d). Craig et al. (1985) inferred this section to be carbonate based on seismic velocities and Embry (1990) suggested it to be correlative with Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic strata, dominantly carbonate shelf facies, of the Franklinian Basin in the Canadian Arctic Islands (Fox, 1985; Harrison and Bally, 1998; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Dewing et al., 2019). Sherwood (1994) invoked a similar correlation based on seismic similarity (his \u201cCarbonate Unit\u201d), as did Homza and Bergman (2019; their \u201cUndeformed Carbonate Unit\u201d). Kumar et al. (2011) referred to distinct reflectors in this section as \u201cIntra-Franklinian reflectors D, E and F.\u201d Because neither the age nor lithology is definitively known, we refer to this succession as simply the F1 section, indicating its lower stratigraphic position in the Franklinian megasequence (Fig. 4). Although apparent stratigraphic reflectors locally are evident below F1 (Fig. 5\n), we observe no definitive stratal patterns and make no attempt to interpret the age or origin those older rocks.\n\nGrantz et al. (1994) noted that the distinctive F1 section appears to continue into the western Beaufort shelf, east of Point Barrow (Nuvuk). Our correlations are consistent with this and suggest the succession is truncated by Mesozoic rift structures in the Beaufort shelf and may be present farther north and west as attenuated and dismembered blocks. The F1 section can be correlated throughout the Arctic Platform of the Chukchi shelf, the Northeast Chukchi Basin of Grantz et al. (1994), and west into the center of the Hanna Trough. Notably, we do not recognize it in the Chukchi Platform west of the Hanna Trough (Fig. 4) where reflectivity is poor.\nWe concur with previous authors that this several-km thick F1 section may be correlative with Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic strata in the Canadian Arctic Islands and further suggest it may be equivalent to the Neoproterozoic Katakturuk Dolomite and lower Paleozoic Nanook Group platformal succession exposed in the Sadlerochit and Shublik Mountains (Macdonald et al., 2009; Strauss et al., 2013, 2019). Thus, we suggest the F1 section may plausibly represent a Neoproterozoic through Ordovician, or possibly even Lower Devonian, passive margin succession in the Franklinian megasequence in the Chukchi shelf.\nOverlying F1 is a well stratified section that displays discontinuous reflector packages of consistent dip, separated by sharp breaks in dip across interfaces, some of which are flat and others that are dipping (Fig. 5). These dip domains, which commonly display irregular geometry (Fig. 5d), generally flatten to approach the dip of the underlying F1 at depth and are truncated by the PMU (Fig. 5c). Complicating interpretation of this interval are shallowly dipping, conflicting seismic events cutting across other events, such as at offset 87\u2013100\u00a0km in Fig. 5a. Because these mimic shallower reflectors, we interpret these as multiple reflections from shallower interfaces.\nThis section has not been penetrated by wells on the Chukchi shelf, and because of the discontinuous character cannot be clearly tied to penetrations in the North Slope or Beaufort shelf. This section has been interpreted as siliciclastic strata (Craig et al., 1985; Sherwood, 1994) that may be Early to Middle Devonian in age, based on similarity to the Ellesmerian foreland basin clastic wedge in the Canadian Arctic Islands (Miall, 1976; Embry, 1991; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Beranek et al., 2010). Alternatively, the section, particularly the lower part, may be Silurian flysch analogous to that found in the northern Canadian Arctic Islands (Trettin, 1998; Hadlari et al., 2014; Dewing et al., 2019) because the docking of Pearya in the Canadian Arctic Islands is thought be Late Ordovician to early Silurian (Trettin, 1998; McClelland et al., 2012). The F2 section may also be composed of foreland-basin deposits associated with the Arctic Caledonian orogeny which may have continued into the Early Devonian in the Chukchi borderland (O'Brien et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2017). The closest wells to the Chukchi study area that penetrate pre-Mississippian strata are those on the North Slope near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), where Upper Ordovician to Silurian rocks have been penetrated (Carter and Laufeld, 1975; Dumoulin, 2001; Houseknecht and Connors, 2016). Thus, we conclude that this reflective section in the Chukchi shelf is Late Ordovician-Devonian in age and denote it as the upper Franklinian F2 section.\nOur interpretation of the F2 section is that it experienced significant contractional deformation, consistent with the interpretations of Sherwood (1994) and Homza and Bergman (2019). Because of the intense deformation, the large spacing of the 2-D seismic grid available, and the lack of distinctive reflectors in this section, we did not attempt to correlate across all thrust sheets, but instead used fault-related folding principles (Shaw et al., 2005) to constrain structural style and fault and fold geometries locally. Specifically, we interpret the predominately west-dipping domains that are truncated locally as west-dipping thrust sheets cutoff against adjacent thrusts (Fig. 5). These geometries are consistent with contractional, imbricate fault-bend folding (Shaw et al., 2005) indicative of a dominantly eastward vergence and tectonic transport direction. Houseknecht and Connors (2016) recognized similar geometries in reflectors they interpreted to be Franklinian in the Beaufort shelf. We interpret the deformation to be detached at the base of the imbricated Upper Ordovician-Devonian strata because of the absence of these dip panels in the inferred Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic passive margin succession (F1, Fig. 5). In places, some intermediate detachment horizons likely are present in F2, with associated front limbs preserved, but several of the thrusts appear to have ramped to a paleosurface, or were later eroded (Fig. 5a and b). The clear angular truncations with the overlying reflectors suggest erosion of the thrust sheets, and the formation of local angular unconformities at the PMU. The irregular nature of this surface may be a relict topography recorded on the top of the fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 5c).\nNo contractional growth strata are observed in the F2 interval. If an Early Devonian depositional age is correct for F2 and because the pre-Mississippian unconformity separates the Ellesmerian megasequence from the Franklinian megasequence below, then folding and thrusting are plausibly Middle to Late Devonian. As with the F1 succession, the fold-and-thrust belt is predominantly recognizable in the Arctic Platform, and can be mapped as far west as the center of the Hanna trough, but not west into the Chukchi Platform (Fig. 6\na). The poor reflector character to the Franklinian megasequence in the Chukchi Platform suggests highly deformed, steeply dipping beds, and potentially an igneous or metamorphic component to the rocks. Subsequent rifting, discussed below, commenced in the Early Mississippian, substantially modifying and obscuring the older fold-and-thrust belt geometry.\n\n\n5\nMississippian negative inversion\nSeismic events above the PMU are highly reflective, and locally, in the deepest positions, display dips that fan to steeper dips at greater time (e.g., Fig. 4, in the center of the Hanna Trough). These generally abut moderately dipping interfaces, and locally in their upper extents are angularly truncated against flat-lying to gently dipping reflectors (e.g., Fig. 5d, offset 65\u00a0km). We interpret these intervals as expanded lower part of the Ellesmerian growth strata (Endicott Group) in half grabens above mostly west-dipping normal faults in the center and eastern parts of the trough (Fig. 4). These structures define the dominant structural feature in the Hanna Trough, a north-south, failed rift system. Crustal extension is proposed to have commenced in the Late Devonian (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). Because this section has not been penetrated in the Chukchi shelf, the age of the onset of rifting is poorly constrained, but likely was occurring by the Early Mississippian, potentially extending into the Pennsylvanian.\nLying above the growth strata, flat-lying to gently dipping, continuous reflectors are present, tied to well penetrations in the Ellesmerian Lisburne Group (Sherwood et al., 2002). This section locally truncates against steeply dipping reflectors at high angles (e.g., Fig. 5c, offset 65\u201367\u00a0km). We interpret these as upper Carboniferous Lisburne strata pinching out against bathymetric scarps, thereby forming buttress unconformities. These likely mark the cessation of rifting and onset of a sag-basin phase (Homza and Bergman, 2019). There may have been continued minor extension during deposition of Lisburne Group strata because the geometry of strata in this section against scarps is not entirely flat-lying in places, such as can be seen on the east of the Hanna Trough (e.g., Fig. 5d, offset 100\u2013103\u00a0km).\nFanning, antithetic dip (rollover) in half grabens is commonly observed and associated with syntectonic (growth) strata related to displacement on flattening normal faults (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Shaw et al., 1997; and many others). Other evidence for the flattening of many of these faults into a mid-crustal detachment zone is indicated by the structural relief across half grabens where the syn-rift lower Ellesmerian section shows little structural relief across hinges. That is, this relationship suggests that only heave could be accommodated at these positions away from the steeper fault segments, based on area balancing constraints. We interpret the northern part of the Hanna Trough to comprise multiple, flattening normal faults that dip both east and west, based on the constraints outlined above. The main rift geometry and timing interpreted here are broadly consistent with previous interpretations by Sherwood et al. (2002), Kumar et al. (2011), and Homza and Bergman (2019). The greatest throw on these crustal normal faults is more than 4\u00a0s TWTT on several west-dipping faults (Fig. 4, offset 160\u00a0km). Based on typical seismic velocities in the area, we estimate that more than 8\u00a0km of syn-rift and post-rift Carboniferous section is preserved in these half grabens. Crustal normal faults are present in the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms, but because of later uplift and erosion do not preserve syn-rift strata (Fig. 6b).\nThe Hanna Trough demonstrates clear reactivation and inversion as indicated by growth strata, local unconformities, and distinctive fault-related folding geometries. In this section we focus on the first of these events related to Carboniferous rifting. In subsequent sections we discuss the later events, and the role of structural inheritance in their development. The Carboniferous rift-related faults generally offset the entire Franklinian section, and typically cut below the Devonian contractional detachment level (Fig. 5). The presence of pre-F1 high-angle faults, evidenced by expanded reflectors below F1 in Fig. 5a and b at offset 85\u201390\u00a0km, may explain why some Carboniferous faults cut the entire basement section. We suggest this evidence represents growth associated with a pre-F1 rift-related fault that provided a zone of weakness reactivated during Carboniferous rifting.\nNonetheless, at shallow levels the Carboniferous normal faults generally appear to localize on or near older thrusts in the F2 section. The reason for this shallow reactivation is likely because these thrusts are commonly imbricated and are steeper than primary thrust faults. Thus, they would have been in a more favorable orientation to slip in negative inversion when the stress field changed to one where crustal extension dominated; that is, where the maximum compressive stress was close to vertical. The fact that these normal faults also generally cut the older F2 contractional detachment horizon suggests that this surface was not as weak as the heterogenous (and commonly previously faulted) mid-crust during Carboniferous rifting.\nThe structures in Fig. 5a and b shows examples of this relationship of shallow negative inversion of Devonian thrusts, with offset of the detachment horizon and shallowly dipping F1 at depth. A compelling example is the complex structure imaged in the highlighted box on Fig. 5b. The seismic energy here is strong, with clear reflectors and few conflicting or cross-cutting reflectors. Thus, we believe the section has been migrated well, and is indicative of true, complex structural geometry. These same relationships are present along strike in other seismic lines, providing further confidence in the relationships inferred on this structure. The geometry is one in which the hanging wall shows steep, west-dipping reflectors of the F2 section in angular truncation with a shallow, predominantly east-dipping lower part of the Ellesmerian section. Furthermore, there is a relict topography on the PMU unconformity. The F2 section dips west in the hanging wall, close to the dip of the Carboniferous normal fault. In the footwall, the F1 is nearly horizontal. A possible explanation of this odd geometry is shown in the sequential, balanced, forward, kinematic model of Fig. 7\n. The seismic section is not depth-migrated, and thus the model is not meant to exactly replicate the seismic section. Nonetheless, the model satisfactorily explains the observed seismic geometry in the Carboniferous and older section. The model steps shown in Fig. 7a and b illustrate a break-forward, imbricate Devonian fold-and-thrust belt with steep westward dip and subsequent angular truncation by the PMU. Fig. 7c is a model step showing how Carboniferous extension reactivated one of the thrust planes in negative inversion but did not follow the thrust plane down to a detachment, but rather flattened slightly at the older flat-ramp transition and offset the detachment and F1 section at depth. Sedimentation occurred in the accommodation created by the extension (Fig. 7c and d) with gentle antithetic dip into the fault. Had the normal fault flattened to the contractional detachment and formed a large concave bend, and assuming the lower part of the Ellesmerian section was syn-rifting, there should have been significant antithetic rollover into the fault based on extensional fault-bend folding theory (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Connors et al., 2021). This reactivated fault coalesces with another rift-related fault just to west (Fig. 5b) and gently flattens into the center of the Hanna Trough. As discussed above, in other places in the Hanna Trough more pronounced antithetic rollover is observed for many of the large half grabens related to a mid-crustal detachment (Fig. 4).\nAnother unusual structural geometry related to Carboniferous negative inversion is shown in the highlighted box in Fig. 5d. At this locality near the center of the Hanna Trough, Endicott Group strata are generally deeper than 5\u00a0s TWTT (offset 7\u201327\u00a0km) and display bidirectional dip and thicken into a syncline. On the east flank of the syncline, the lower part of the Ellesmerian strata thin and pinch out by onlap onto an inferred, west-dipping Carboniferous normal fault. Although east-dipping strata on the west flank of the syncline are consistent with antithetic rollover on a flattening normal fault, west-dipping strata on the east flank suggest synthetic rollover relative to the normal fault. These observations are consistent with extensional fault-bend folding theory of a convex, extensional fault-bed (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Connors et al., 2021). Fig. 8\n demonstrates a sequential, balanced, forward, kinematic model that explains this observed Carboniferous and older geometry. The model is not an exact attempt at matching the observed structure, and the absence of post-Carboniferous differential subsidence modeling across the section somewhat obscures the geometry. Nonetheless, we feel it does explain many of the features observed in the seismic record. Fig. 8a thru 8d model a break-forward imbricate Devonian fold-and-thrust belt that developed first, with potentially significant topography. Fig. 8e and f model a thrust that was reactivated in negative inversion during the Carboniferous, but along a fault with both steepening and flattening segments. The convex bend across the steepening segment was due to the previously folded, contractional, second imbricate fault, and the concave bend was due to the normal fault taking advantage of the older contractional detachment horizon. Thus, the normal fault closely mimicked the contractional geometry of the westernmost thrust, resulting in the strange locally thick Ellesmerian section and related synclinal geometry of extensional growth strata. This stands in contrast with the previous example (Fig. 7), in which the normal fault cut across the older detachment. Local reactivation of the older contractional detachment suggests that here, in the center of the Hanna Trough during Carboniferous rifting, the older thrust-fault detachment likely was weaker than the F1 strata in the footwall below the detachment. It is not known why that would be the case. We speculate it may be due to local facies changes, or fluid pressure along the detachment, or that the mid-crust in this locality lacks pre-F1 faults or weak zones. There is likely another reactivation in this complex structure, a component of Cenozoic extension, as discussed in a later section.\n\n\n6\nLate Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion\nAn interval of relative tectonic quiescence persisted from the Mississippian through the Triassic across Arctic Alaska during which the Hanna Trough evolved into a sag basin and the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms remained structural highs (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). The upper part of the Ellesmerian megasequence strata reflect this quiescence, with generally carbonate and fine-grained siliciclastic deposition, including a relatively high proportion of petroleum source rocks in the Hanna Trough sag basin (Sherwood et al., 2002). The Lower and Middle Jurassic strata of the Beaufortian megasequence, including the lower part of the Kingak Shale, were likely deposited during this pausing of tectonism.\nTectonic activity was renewed in the Late Jurassic, with the initiation of rifting and opening of the North Chukchi and Canada Basins to the north and northeast, respectively (Grantz et al., 2011; Shephard et al., 2013; Hutchinson et al., 2017). To the south and southeast, closure of the South Anuyi ocean basin culminated in the Chukotka orogen and closure of the Angayucham ocean basin culminated in the Brooks Range orogen, respectively, during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Shephard et al., 2013; Amato et al., 2015; Moore and Box, 2016). The Jurassic rifting events to the north impacted the Chukchi shelf by thermal bulging, rifting, and volcanism in parts of the Hanna Trough (Homza and Bergman, 2019). Strike-slip and contractional deformation of the North Chukchi high and \u201cGrantz transpression zone\u201d probably was under way during the Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) (Fig. 1; Homza and Bergman, 2019), although the age of initiation is not apparent. The closure of ocean basins to the south likely impacted at least the southern Chukchi shelf as fold-and-thrust belts associated with the Chukotka and Brooks Range orogens propagated northward, although the northern extent of Jurassic thrusting was located considerably south of the Wrangel-Herald Arch and current Brooks Range frontal fold-thrust belt shown in Fig. 1 (Moore and Box, 2016).\nBeaufortian strata in the Chukchi shelf were significantly influenced by Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) deformation. In the northern Chukchi shelf and adjacent North Slope, a series of southward off-lapping sequence sets was deposited in response to rift-shoulder uplift associated with opening of the Canada Basin, constructing a series of west-northwest-oriented shelf margins (Hubbard et al., 1987; Sherwood et al., 2002; Houseknecht and Bird, 2004; Houseknecht and Connors, 2015; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019a). However, across much of the Chukchi shelf, Beaufortian strata display eastward clinoform dip and north-oriented shelf margins; this has been interpreted as evidence for positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-phase normal faults (Houseknecht and Connors, 2015), as shown below.\nAlong the southern boundary between the Chukchi Platform and Hanna Trough, several north-trending, rift-phase normal faults display geometries that suggest they were inverted during Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Fig. 6b). For example, in the structure shown in Fig. 9\n\n (offset 87\u201390\u00a0km), growth strata of the lower part of the Ellesmerian thicken in the hanging wall, consistent with a normal sense of motion during Carboniferous faulting. Yet the top of the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence (PU) and the Jurassic unconformity (JU) are structurally higher on the hanging wall than on the footwall by about 0.5\u00a0s TWTT (close to 1\u00a0km), indicating subsequent reverse motion at depth on the fault. Moreover, the upper part of the Ellesmerian (PU to JU) conserves layer thickness, suggesting an intermediate time in which no motion on the fault occurred. Beaufortian strata expand across the front of the structure, and the Lower Cretaceous unconformity is structurally higher on the hanging wall than on the footwall, although the structural relief is less than on the Jurassic unconformity. These observations indicate accommodation was created during this time, with likely growth strata, and constrain the age of inversion to Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.\nThe details of the broader structure are less definitive; for example, a back limb to the structure is not clearly apparent locally. Thus, the structure does not fit the geometry of a classic positive inversion structure as defined by Williams et al. (1989). There are poor reflectors potentially associated with strata of the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence on the west side of the line in Fig. 9. Therefore, the structure could be characterized as a basement uplift with a frontal monocline, much like those in the Colorado Plateau (Bump, 2003). Because the upper part of the Ellesmerian section broadly conserves layer thickness in the east limb, and reactivated slip on the older fault is small, the fault-related folding kinematics of the front limb are ambiguous. The structural style in the front limb may involve low propagation-to-slip, trishear kinematics (Allmendinger, 1998), or it may be associated with contractional fault-bend-fold kinematics along a fault flattening to an upper detachment, with minor slip on the detachment dissipated into the center of the basin.\n\n\n7\nComplex Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contraction and positive inversion\nCretaceous and Paleogene tectonics in the Chukchi shelf region mainly involved development of the fold-and-thrust belts of the Wrangel-Herald Arch (frontal belt of Chukotka orogen) and western Brooks Range. These events included significant uplift and exhumation, which shed a huge volume of siliciclastic sediment into the foreland, as well as contractional deformation of the western Colville foreland basin in the southern Chukchi shelf and adjacent North Slope (Mull et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2002; Sherwood et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2015; Moore and Box, 2016; Craddock and Houseknecht, 2016; Craddock et al., 2018; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019b; Lease et al., 2022, Fig. 1). However, the thin-skinned folding and thrusting in this foreland position are locally detached at or near the Lower Cretaceous unconformity and thus no structural inheritance or inversion is apparent.\nIn contrast, Cretaceous to possibly Paleogene contraction in the northern Chukchi shelf is expressed in a different structural style, including complex interactions with older structures. The North Chukchi high (Thurston and Theiss, 1987; Johnson, 1990; Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019, Figs. 3 and 6c), a basement uplift with substantial structural relief between the base of the Hanna Trough on the south to the crest of the structural high (Fig. 10), is the most distinctive expression of this deformation. The Hanna Trough, shown in the south part of Fig. 10, displays regional unconformities that show a reflective character similar to seismic images previously shown, with approximately consistent megasequence thicknesses in this orientation. In the center of the line (offset 45\u201380\u00a0km) a strong series of reflectors cannot be correlated below \u223c1\u00a0s TWTT and deeper data show substantial conflicting energy. Based on regional ties and the reflective character in this image, including local swings in reflectivity, we interpret that these likely are seismic artifacts in an otherwise reflective-poor, seismically quiescent, Franklinian section. The north part of the line (offset 85\u2013100\u00a0km) shows improved reflective character that can be mapped beneath, as well as truncating against, the seismically quiescent section. We tentatively interpret a PMU extending northward, but more work is warranted to better constrain the age of the section below this prominent unconformity. The LCU and KPU can be tied regionally, constraining the age of the younger strata and deformation.\nWe interpret the structural relief (more than 10\u00a0km) across the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high to be the result of large, south-vergent, contractional fault-bend folds along north-dipping imbricate thrusts (Fig. 10). Parallel folding just south of the high (offset 20\u201335\u00a0km) suggests contractional deformation by flexural slip and southward tectonic transport is constrained by the major structural relief through imbrication that brought the top of the pre-Mississippian section close to the seafloor in places. Fold limbs comprising Upper Cretaceous strata in angular truncation by the KPU brackets the timing of latest contraction to Late Cretaceous-early Paleogene. The southward tectonic transport from causative deep thrusts that step up to a local detachment in the lower part of the Ellesmerian section in the center of the Hanna Trough significantly constrains the interpretation. No additional contractional structures that can be linked to this detachment have been observed to the south in the Hanna Trough and, therefore, slip must be transferred back to the north as structural wedges in a triangle zone. Just north of this triangle zone (offset 40\u201355\u00a0km), south-directed thrust imbrication bring Franklinian basement close to the seafloor, providing some of the observed structural relief across the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high. The wedge interpretation requires some late south-directed thrusting to cut the roof thrust, but there may have been a component of earlier thrusting on these faults and associated uplift.\nWe interpret the northern boundary of the North Chukchi high to be bounded by deep-seated, south-dipping thrust faults that ramped northward up to a Cretaceous paleo-seafloor, forming local fault-bend folds. This likely occurred in the absence of significant local sediment cover at the time of thrusting, as constrained by the lack of folded growth strata in the lower Brookian megasequence. We interpret shortening to have commenced in the Aptian, as constrained by folding of the LCU and overlying Lower Cretaceous strata, and truncation by the KPU (offset 85\u201390\u00a0km in Fig. 10). Such deformation would be approximately coeval with deposition of the \u201cKalubik wedge,\u201d a lower Brookian succession unique to the Chukchi shelf that shed southward from the North Chukchi high (Homza and Bergman, 2019). These observations imply that uplift across the southern boundary of the high also occurred at this time, but direct evidence of that timing apparently was obliterated by later thrusting, as discussed above.\nOverall structural relief across the North Chukchi high suggests thrusts root in a mid-crustal detachment, likely as a distributed shear zone with associated crustal thickening, given the inferred depth at the time of deformation. The depth of the inferred detachment is similar to that of the Carboniferous rift-related detachment just to the south (Fig. 11\n). We speculate that the rift-related detachment may have localized the later contractional detachment, although it is difficult to demonstrate the extent of structural inheritance because the contractional inversion is nearly orthogonal to the older normal faults. Sherwood et al. (2002) proposed that the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high was an inverted Carboniferous transform fault that offset the Hanna Trough rift segment from an inferred rift segment in the North Chukchi Basin to the west. If that is the case, then this would indeed constitute true structural inheritance, at a basin-scale.\n\nHomza and Bergman (2019) document this trend of Late Cretaceous to Paleogene contraction also near the Popcorn well (Fig. 6c) which they termed the Popcorn high. We concur with this interpretation and propose that this is a continuation of a \u223c300-km-long regional contractional belt (Fig. 6c), obscured by later Cenozoic deformation. Given the multiple phases of growth to the structures, and the proximity to older Carboniferous rifts, the Popcorn high is another form of structural inheritance whereby the older Carboniferous north-south striking, rift-related normal faults act as strike-slip faults in the Cretaceous to Paleogene. These tear faults bound the southward-transported contractional structures (Fig. 6c). In this scenario the Popcorn high is both a Carboniferous horst, and a later Cretaceous to Paleogene block of imbricate thrusts. The east-west orientation of the line in Fig. 11b thus captures the dip-slip component to Carboniferous extension, whereas the north-south Cretaceous to Paleogene shortening occurs as motion in and out of the plane of the section. Subsequent Cenozoic extension resulted in another structural reactivation, as discussed in the subsequent section.\nLate Cretaceous-early Paleogene structural inheritance in the Hanna Trough is also manifest just southeast of the main North Chukchi high (Fig. 11c). Timing of contraction is constrained by the folded LCU and Lower Cretaceous strata (offset 230\u00a0km), similar to the nearby North Chukchi high (Fig. 10). Superficially, the structure in Fig. 11c looks like a positive inversion structure (Williams et al., 1989) associated with reactivation of a Carboniferous normal fault, with a long back limb and short front limb, a normal sense of motion at depth, and positive relief in the shallow horizons. However, this and other similar structures in the area likely were reactivated in oblique positive inversion. These structures strike in a discontinuous approximately north-south direction (Fig. 6c). If some displacement associated with the North Chukchi high was sent southward along a mid-crustal detachment and encountered Carboniferous normal fault geometries that strike north-south, then highly oblique structures associated with lateral boundaries of this enigmatic Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contractional event are plausible.\n\n\n8\nCenozoic extensional reactivation of rift features\nCenozoic strata in the Chukchi shelf represent a continuation of Brookian megasequence sedimentation associated with northward routing of sediments derived from Chukotka and the western Brooks Range (Thurston and Theiss, 1987; Sherwood et al., 2002; Houseknecht and Bird, 2011; Homza and Bergman, 2019). Most of these previous authors invoke transtensional and transpressional deformation in the Chukchi shelf in the Cenozoic based on interpreted flower structures on vertically exaggerated seismic sections. While some strike-slip component is likely present, it is challenging to ascertain this from a regional 2D seismic grid. When seismic lines in the area are examined with approximately no vertical exaggeration, it is clear that extension is ubiquitous, with a significant inheritance from previous structures.\nInspection of seismic data from the northern Chukchi Platform shows clear reflectors in the top 3\u00a0s TWTT that can be followed across discrete high-angle boundaries, with reflector offset, and in places dip into the boundaries (Fig. 11). These reflector geometries and correlation of regional unconformities indicate fault reactivation during Cenozoic crustal extension along mainly east-dipping, normal faults that are high-angle near the surface and sole to a mid-crustal detachment (Fig. 11a). Ellesmerian growth strata in the eastern grabens indicate Early Mississippian extension. Paleocene to Pliocene structural reactivation is evident by offset of the KPU and post-Paleogene growth strata (Fig. 11a). Ellesmerian strata thin to the west, but the relationship of older faults being reactivated discretely in the Cenozoic holds. On the east side of the line (Fig. 11a, offset 80\u201385\u00a0km), salt deposition in the Carboniferous, with modest reactive diapirism in the Cenozoic (Thurston and Lothamer, 1991; Homza and Bergman, 2019), is consistent with these two phases of crustal extension.\nIn contrast, in the central Hanna Trough, despite the fact that discrete Carboniferous rift-related normal faults mainly dip west, Cenozoic faults dip in both directions, in a more distributed fashion, forming local half grabens (Fig. 11b). In many cases, the seismic imaging is insufficient to resolve the fault geometry at depth, which may suggest these Cenozoic faults sole in a complex fashion into a local detachment in the upper part of the Ellesmerian, or alternatively strain may be distributed below seismic resolution at this stratigraphic interval. The strikes of minor Cenozoic normal faults are difficult to determine because of the modest throw and regional seismic grid spacing. Nonetheless, if the sections are displayed with little vertical exaggeration one can infer a nominally true dip orientation of east and west because these Cenozoic faults are high-angle and thus approximate the primary fault geometry shown in Fig. 11b. Thus, this Cenozoic extension is mostly east-west, mimicking the earlier extension direction.\nSupporting this is the fact that there is an increased amount of Cenozoic extension above the older rifts, and thus these Cenozoic faults appear related to the older extensional fabric, as is interpreted on the fault in the center of the section in Fig. 11b (offset 165\u2013175\u00a0km). This suggests that a local response to renewed crustal rifting occurred in places. A similar localized Cenozoic extensional reactivation is observed above the Carboniferous negative inversion structure shown in Fig. 5d. Cenozoic normal faults also cut the Late Cretaceous inversion structures discussed in the previous section, but not necessarily at original, Carboniferous rifts. An example is observed in the Cenozoic faults on the crest and back limb of the inversion structure in Fig. 11c (offset 220\u2013225\u00a0km). The contrast between distributed Cenozoic extension in the Hanna Trough, and discrete Cenozoic extension in the Chukchi Platform may be due to local variations in mechanical strength in the lithosphere related to the amount of post-rift section in each area.\n\n\n9\nDiscussion\n\n9.1\nTectonic implications\nSeveral observations presented here are consistent with the Chukchi Platform being the hinterland, and the Arctic Platform the foreland, of a major middle Paleozoic convergent margin. These include: 1) the change in seismic character of the F2 (likely Upper Ordovician-Devonian) section across the Hanna Trough, 2) the fold vergence and tectonic transport to the east, and 3) the detached style in the Arctic Platform. Sherwood et al. (2002) proposed that the high magnetic signature in the Chukchi Platform may reflect volcanic arc rocks juxtaposed against sedimentary strata to the east in the Hanna Trough and Arctic Platform. Miller et al. (2017) proposed that the Chukchi Platform is the metamorphic core of the Arctic Caledonian orogen related to the suturing of Pearya onto Laurentia. This would be a southern extension of the Pearya-Laurentia terrane boundary in the Chukchi borderland proposed by O'Brien et al. (2016) based on dredge samples and consistent with earlier dredge and core samples from Grantz et al. (1998). Homza and Bergman (2019) likewise postulated a suture between Pearya and Laurentia along the Hanna Trough. On the eastern flank of the Hanna Trough and western margin of the Arctic Platform thick-skinned contraction involving much of the Franklinian megasequence has been proposed (Kumar et al., 2011). Miller et al. (2017) interpreted this to be the basement-involved thrust front of the Arctic Caledonian orogen. As discussed above, we interpret the F1 to not be involved in contraction, and instead have a detached fold-and-thrust belt lying above it. Thus, this contraction may be a thin-skinned foreland of the final vestiges of the Arctic Caledonian orogen, in the Late Silurian to Early Devonian. Similar aged contractional structures and uplift have been observed in the Canadian Arctic Islands related to the Boothia event (Harrison, 2018; Dewing et al., 2019). Alternatively, the deformation may be analogous with the Early to Middle Devonian Romanzof orogeny in northwestern Yukon and Arctic Alaska (Lane, 2007). The folding and thrusting could also potentially be Late Devonian to Early Mississippian, similar to the Ellesmerian orogeny of Arctic Canada (Trettin et al., 1991; Embry, 1991; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Beranek et al., 2010). In short, at this point timing of the fold-and-thrust belt involving the F2 strata is poorly constrained because timing of the section itself is not well known.\nAt a basin-scale, crustal normal faults that cut the pre-Mississippian unconformity (PMU) are present in much of the same area as the observed pre-Mississippian (likely Devonian) fold-and-thrust belt (compare Fig. 5a and b). These rifts also extend west beyond the main Hanna Trough and into the Chukchi Platform (Figs. 4 and 6b). The close correspondence in space and time of contraction followed by extension, as well as the fault-fold geometries discussed previously, suggest post-orogenic collapse (Dewey, 1988) in the hinterland of the older fold-and-thrust belt to form the Hanna Trough, consistent with the views of Homza and Bergman (2019).\nThe Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-related normal faults resulted in localized west-east shortening (Fig. 6b). The fact that they are localized in the southern Hanna Trough (Fig. 6b) suggests they may be a far-field effect of oblique contraction in the foreland of the Chukotkan orogeny (Houseknecht and Connors, 2015; Homza and Bergman, 2019).\nThe North Chukchi high represents a significant regional, if poorly understood, contractional feature in the Arctic. Formation of it overlaps temporally with contractional deformation in the Wrangel-Herald Arch and western Brooks Range but lies about 200\u00a0km north of the foreland structures (Fig. 1) and nearly 400\u00a0km north of the main orogens (Moore and Box, 2016). Homza and Bergman (2019) pointed out the connection to the east-northeast trending \u201cGrantz transpressional zone\u201d (Fig. 1), although the extent and kinematic role of a transverse component in forming the north- and south-vergent contractional structures remain unknown.\nThe greatest Cenozoic extension is in the northern Hanna Trough and diminishes to the south (Fig. 6c). Unmapped at this time is the complex Cenozoic extension at the margin of the North Chukchi Basin. Related extension may link to the Chukchi borderland (Fig. 1), where existing fault scarps are pronounced in bathymetry (Ilhan and Coakley, 2018). This extension at the margin of the North Chukchi Basin speculatively may be due more to far-field, plate-related mechanisms, perhaps related to opening of the Eurasia Basin and northward propagation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Cenozoic (Shephard et al., 2013).\n\n\n9.2\nPetroleum systems implications\nPetroleum systems elements of the Chukchi shelf are summarized below, based on Sherwood et al. (1998, 2002), Houseknecht et al. (2012), Villegas et al. (2017), Homza and Bergman (2019), and Houseknecht (2021, 2022). Known and potential oil-prone source rocks are concentrated in and near the Hanna Trough, particularly in Carboniferous to Lower Jurassic sag-basin deposits. Known source rocks are present in the Triassic Shublik Formation, distal facies of the Triassic Sadlerochit Group, and Jurassic Kingak Shale. Potential source rocks may occur in the Carboniferous Lisburne Group (Fig. 2). Source rocks also are known in Cretaceous foreland basin deposits of the informally named pebble shale unit (PSU) and gamma-ray zone (GRZ), although these tend to be of lower quality than coeval strata in the North Slope and Beaufort shelf. Source rocks are postulated to occur in Cenozoic strata in the northern Chukchi shelf, most likely in distal facies of Barremian to Turonian and Eocene strata. Known and potential reservoir rocks occur throughout the Phanerozoic stratigraphic section, mainly in sandstone but also in carbonate rocks of the Lisburne Group. Two- and three-dimensional seismic data reveal a spectrum of stratigraphic, structural, and combination trap geometries spanning the stratigraphic column and present across much of the Chukchi shelf. Seals are mainly shale throughout the region and evaporite seals may be present locally in grabens known to contain evaporites within the Ellesmerian megasequence, mainly in the northwestern Chukchi shelf.\nBurial history modeling suggests that oil generation from pre-Cretaceous source rocks occurred during the Early to Late Cretaceous and from Cretaceous and Cenozoic source rocks during the Late Cretaceous to Neogene. Within this temporal context, structural inheritance may have exerted both positive and negative influences on the occurrence and preservation of hydrocarbon accumulations. Early Cretaceous and older structural events likely had little influence on petroleum systems other than creating potential migration pathways and traps for hydrocarbons generated during subsequent burial. However, Late Cretaceous and younger structural events may have influenced petroleum systems elements significantly.\nLate Cretaceous to Paleogene contraction and positive inversion likely post-dated or temporally overlapped hydrocarbon generation in Lower Cretaceous and older source rocks. The most likely positive influence may have been the creation of potential migration pathways and structural and combination traps that may have formed during or shortly following hydrocarbon generation; natural gas trapped in the Burger anticline may be an example. Negative influences may have included uplift and exhumation of strata comprising potential carrier beds and reservoir rocks, resulting in migration to the ground surface or seafloor; the non-productive Popcorn anticline may be an example.\nCenozoic extensional reactivation of rift features likely post-dated or temporally overlapped hydrocarbon generation in Lower Cretaceous source rocks. Positive results may have included creation of diapiric traps (salt domes) and seals in evaporite-bearing grabens and formation of structural traps comprising rotated fault blocks and other transpressional closures; none of these trap types has been tested. Negative results may have included fracture-breaching of older traps and seals leading to remigration of previously trapped hydrocarbons to the ground surface or sea floor.\n\n\n\n10\nConclusion and future work\nWe have presented several seismic examples of structural inheritance in the Chukchi shelf, Alaska. These include: 1) Carboniferous negative inversion of a Devonian east-vergent fold-and-thrust belt widespread within the Hanna Trough and Arctic Platform, 2) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-related normal faults, 3) Late Cretaceous-Paleogene positive inversion in the North Chukchi High, and 4) Cenozoic extension and strike-slip reactivation and negative inversion manifest in a variety of forms in the northern Chukchi shelf. The multiple episodes of reactivation show that structural inheritance can be passed down through multiple generations during the tectonic evolution of an area. The fact that such structures are spatially so close shows how important it is to consider inheritance in an interpretation.\nThe North Chukchi high, particularly its northern boundary, is not well constrained and merits further study. Determining the lateral extent of reactivation and more complete 3D geometry of the North Chukchi high polyphase deformation is a logical next step. Because of the extent of structural inheritance, and changing tectonic transport directions over time, 3D modeling and balancing or restoration based on interpretations from depth-migrated images may be required, and would lend additional confidence in, or modifications to, the interpretations presented here. Such work would require unraveling the Cenozoic extension and strike-slip faulting in the area, in and of itself poorly understood. Mapping out in more detail the nature of Cenozoic extension as it extends into the poorly known North Chukchi Basin and Chukchi borderland would likewise be useful, and has implications for circum-Arctic Cenozoic tectonics.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nConnors: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization, Funding acquisition.

Such phenomena are important to document and analyse, since they can provide important constraints on the distribution of overpressured compartments in a basin, and may provide evidence of secondary migration of hydrocarbons (Cartwright et al., 2007).\nMost venting phenomena appear to represent a single, well defined episode of highly focused fluid escape to the sea floor. A good example is a single mud volcano, where the extrusion of a slurry of water and mud, commonly accompanied by gas, may erupt continuously or episodically over a geologically short period of years to 1000s of years to build a single mud edifice (Deville et al., 2010). Much more rarely documented are venting phenomena that erupt from a single locus a number of times in a series of discrete fluid expulsion events, separated by long periods of dormancy. Vertically stacked pockmarks (Andresen and Huuse, 2011) or \u2018Christmas tree\u2019 mud volcanic structures are examples of these more long term episodic phenomena (Deville and Guerlais, 2009; Evans et al., 2007; Stewart and Davies, 2006). These episodic phenomena are important to understand more fully because they represent systems where a highly overpressured compartment of a basin is able to depressurize by venting some of the trapped overpressured fluids but is then subsequently re-pressured until a threshold is reached for another venting episode, leading to a \u2018sawtooth\u2019 pressure evolution through time (Cartwright et al., 2021). Analysis of this type of pressure evolution has the potential to shed light on specific overpressuring mechanisms in basins and on the temporal and spatial evolution of overpressured compartments.\nThe aim of this paper is to reconstruct the pressure evolution of a group of recently discovered linear trails of fluid escape pipes that occur in a deep water setting in the Herodotus Basin on the lower continental slope off the West Nile Deep Sea Fan (Fig. 1\n) and discuss their implications for salt seal failure and pressure recharge. The pipe trails are located in an area where there has been active petroleum exploration involving both pre- and post-salt plays since the 1980s (Dolson, 2020; Gardosh and Tannenbaum, 2014), and where some >80 Tcf of gas has been discovered in the last decade (Cozzi et al., 2018; Dolson et al., 2005; Needham et al., 2017; Ratner, 2016).\nInsights into the pressure distribution within this region are important not only for drilling safety, but from a wider context of understanding seals and migration (Dolson, 2020; Needham et al., 2017; Al-Balushi et al., 2016). It is commonly argued that thick evaporite layers represent almost ideal seals for petroleum entrapment because of their continuity, homogeneity and extremely low permeability (Downey, 1984). We show that the thick salt seal in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan has been repeatedly breached at 50\u2013150 kyrs intervals above a suite of erosional stratigraphic traps at the base-salt. Furthermore, we show that the overpressure mechanisms operative in the basin during the Pliocene to Recent have been able to repeatedly recharge pressure in the stratigraphic traps to near or in excess of the lithostatic pressure.\n\n\n2\nPrevious work\nSeveral previous studies have documented linear pipe trails and have interpreted them as being related to episodic fluid escape from overpressured pre-salt traps, coeval to flow of the overlying salt layer through which the pipes propagate (Figs. 1 and 2\n) (Cartwright et al., 2018; Kirkham et al., 2019; Oppo et al., 2021b). These studies were all based on 3D seismic surveys located in the northern Levant Basin, offshore Lebanon (Fig. 1). They argued that the vented fluids were sourced from the crestal regions of folded and highly overpressured Oligo-Miocene reservoirs that are sealed by a \u223c1\u00a0km thick claystone layer that is overlain by the Messinian Evaporites (Fig. 2). The timing of venting was interpreted from the stratigraphic position of the outlet (pockmarks or mud volcanoes), and the pipes were interpreted to have formed by hydraulic fracturing of the thick salt and claystone seal (Cartwright et al., 2021; Kirkham et al., 2018b). The linear alignment of outlets is parallel with the regional salt flow direction. Importantly, their distribution was interpreted to be the result of episodic venting from the crest of the pre-salt folded reservoir during regional basinward flow of the Messinian Evaporite. This resulted in offset of the outlet from above its genetically connected root in the pre-salt and deformation of the pipe in the salt (Fig. 2) (Evans et al., 2021; Kirkham et al., 2019). In this evolutionary model, each new venting episode forms a new vertical pipe by hydraulic fracture propagation through the salt and forms a new outlet at a younger stratigraphic position. The new pipe and outlet form in the same location as the preceding pipe and outlet that has since been offset from above the crest of the pre-salt fold by the flowing salt (Fig. 2). This makes interpreting each discrete venting episode relatively straightforward and negates the challenge of interpreting pockmark vents stacked within a pipes vertical zone of low signal-to-noise ratio (Andresen and Huuse, 2011).\n\nCartwright et al. (2021) demonstrated a method of using episodic fluid escape pipe trails located offshore Lebanon (Figs. 1 and 2) as a tool to assist in reconstructing overpressure magnitude and pressure evolution within a deeply buried overpressured compartment. Contrasting overpressuring mechanisms for episodic venting in this region have been proposed. Cartwright et al. (2021) argued that tectonic overpressuring is the dominant mechanism with a minor contribution from the buoyancy of a hydrocarbon column and disequilibrium compaction. In contrast, Oppo et al. (2021b) argued for lateral pressure transfer due to tilting of overpressured aquifers but with a minor contribution from tectonic compression as a possibility.\nMost recently, Kirkham and Cartwright (2021) identified and mapped five linear fluid escape trails from a different basin in the Eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 1). This recent study was located in the Herodotus Basin in the area of the West Nile Deep Sea Fan (Figs. 1 and 3\n). The primary focus of that study was the identification of kinematic markers for the flow of the salt layer during salt tectonic deformation. The implications of these pipe trails for the pressure evolution of this area and cross-salt seal leakage was not considered. The purpose of this manuscript is to explore the fluid plumbing system, pressure requirements, pressure evolution and overpressuring mechanisms for these episodic pipe trails. Whilst the episodic venting described here is comparable to the examples in the North Levant Basin in its expression as pipe trails, we show that the pipe trails in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan contrast in their trap configuration, source region, top seal and overpressuring mechanisms (see Section 6.2).\n\n\n3\nGeological setting and petroleum systems\n\n3.1\nGeological setting\nThe study area is in the Herodotus Basin in the region of the West Nile Deep Sea Fan (Figs. 1 and 3A). The Nile Delta and Fan extend over a much older section of passive margin that formed following a period of rifting during the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Salem, 1976; Dolson et al., 2005). The Late Cretaceous to Mid Eocene period was dominated by carbonate deposition over much of the continental margin, with an almost complete lack of fluvial clastic input (Fig. 4\n) (Underwood et al., 2013). Uplift of East Africa during the Eocene triggered northerly drainage and a transition in the Mid-Late Eocene from carbonate to clastic deposition (Fig. 4).\nThe Oligo-Miocene succession contains a large volume of fluvial sediments that prograded over the underlying carbonate platform and ramp (Figs. 3B, 4 and 5\nA) (Dolson et al., 2005; Said, 1962; Salem, 1976; Underwood et al., 2013). This succession is calibrated in the Raven and North Idku gas fields some 100\u00a0km east of the study area (Fig. 3A), where the Oligo-Miocene comprises marine shales with confined turbidites and multi-story channel systems (Fig. 4) (Kellner et al., 2018; Dolson, 2020).\nOverlying the clastic wedge of the Oligo-Miocene, is the 1\u20131.5\u00a0km thick Messinian Evaporite sequence (Figs. 3B, 4 and 5A). This is primarily composed of halite and was deposited during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (\u223c5.97\u20135.33Ma) (Krijgsman et al., 1999; Manzi et al., 2013; Meilijson et al., 2019) following a progressive disconnection of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. The Messinian Evaporites exhibit a wedge shaped geometry in the study area with a generally northward increase in thickness from a pinch out that runs along the basin margins (Figs. 1, 3 and 5A) (Hs\u00fc et al., 1977; Ryan, 2009). Immediately prior to salt deposition, the basin margins and some sections of the deeper basin were extensively incised by networks of valleys and submarine canyons that removed hundreds of meters of the Oligo-Miocene clastics (Bertoni and Cartwright, 2006; Druckman et al., 1995; Ryan and Cita, 1978; Mousouliotis et al., 2020). The rapid deposition of the thick salt layer (<500 Ka; Meilijson et al. (2019) and Roveri et al. (2014)) led to overpressuring of the Oligo-Miocene succession by undercompaction (Bertoni and Cartwright, 2015; Kirkham et al., 2017; Al-Balushi et al., 2016). The Messinian Salinity Crisis was terminated by the Zanclean flood at 5.33\u00a0Ma when connection between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea was re-established (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009).\nThe Pliocene to Recent period witnessed a return to clastic deposition in the basin with the development of the Nile Delta and Nile Deep Sea Fan (Figs. 3C and 4) (Loncke et al., 2006). The Pliocene to Recent stratigraphy is dominated by deep water hemipelagic deposits with turbiditic input to the study area via the Rosetta Canyon and Rosetta channel-levee system from the western branch of the Nile Delta (Loncke et al., 2004; Garziglia et al., 2008; Macgregor, 2012). Sedimentation rates of up to \u223c150\u00a0cm\/kyrs are recorded for the Holocene close to the Rosetta Channel (Garziglia et al., 2008) and much lower rates of \u223c9\u00a0cm\/kyrs from turbidites deposited over a mud volcano in the study area (Ducassou, 2006; Giresse et al., 2010).\nWidespread basinward salt flow during the Pliocene to Recent has led to the development of an extensional domain with thinned salt and margin parallel normal faults that detach within the Messinian Evaporites, a translational domain containing little deformation, and a contractional domain with thickened salt, thrusts and salt cored folds that detach in the Messinian Evaporites (Allen et al., 2016). The study area straddles the extensional and translational salt tectonic domains, whereas the contractional domain is located further basinward toward the Mediterranean Ridge (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021; Loncke et al., 2006). The simplest characterisation of the flow regime through the salt here is Couette flow although a more complex hybrid between Couette and Poiseuille flow is possible (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021).\nThe West Nile Deep Sea Fan is one of the most prolific mud volcano provinces on Earth (Fig. 5B) (Kirkham et al., 2017). Giant mud volcanoes and mud canopies were extruded on top of the Messinian Evaporites in the study area during the Late Messinian or Zanclean (Fig. 5) (Kirkham et al., 2018a, 2020b). These are amongst the largest mud extrusions on Earth and cover areas up to 300\u00a0km2, reach up to 1\u00a0km in thickness and are sourced from the Oligo-Miocene. A further >400 mud volcanoes (Fig. 5B) that are sourced from the Oligo-Miocene have erupted during the Early Pliocene to Present in the study area (Kirkham et al., 2017; Dupr\u00e9 et al., 2010; Loncke et al., 2004; Mascle et al., 2014).\n\n\n3.2\nPetroleum systems\nThe Nile Delta and Nile Deep Sea Fan is one of the major hydrocarbon provinces in the Eastern Mediterranean with estimated reserves of \u223c218 Tcf of gas and \u223c52 billion barrels of condensate (Hanafy et al., 2016; Dolson et al., 2014). The main reservoirs (mainly for gas) are Cretaceous-Miocene aged platform carbonates (Cozzi et al., 2018; Dolson, 2020) and slope channel sandstones of Oligo-Miocene and Pliocene age (Fig. 4) (Kellner et al., 2018; Dolson et al., 2005; Samuel et al., 2003). These reservoirs are sealed by marine shales and the regional Messinian Evaporites (Fig. 3) (Nashaat, 1994). The Messinian Evaporites seal Miocene Reservoirs with gas columns in excess of 600\u00a0m (Cozzi et al., 2018; Dolson, 2020).\nThe main source rocks are interpreted to be Pliocene sapropels, Oligo-Miocene pro-delta shales and Upper Cretaceous black shales (Fig. 4) (Aal et al., 2000; Dolson et al., 2005; Samuel et al., 2003; Vandr\u00e9 et al., 2007; Sharaf, 2003). Geochemical analysis of gas samples from Early Miocene to Pliocene reservoirs in the western Nile Delta (Fig, 3A) are dominated by mixed microbial and thermogenic methane gas (Vandr\u00e9 et al., 2007). Samples from mud volcanoes in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan (Fig. 5B) are strongly saturated with oily hydrocarbons (Pierre et al., 2014) and gas which has a mixed biogenic and thermogenic signature, with some high maturities indicative of seepage from great depth (Prinzhofer and Deville, 2013; Woodside et al., 2004). The basal Pliocene source interval is thermogenically immature throughout the Nile Delta, therefore these thermogenic gas seeps must be sourced from beneath the Messinian Evaporites (Aal et al., 2000; Sharaf, 2003; Vandr\u00e9 et al., 2007). The Oligo-Miocene is a prolific biogenic source rock that has charged several large deepwater Oligo-Miocene discoveries in which >80 Tcf of methane has been discovered (Al-Balushi et al., 2016; Cozzi et al., 2018; Needham et al., 2017).\nThe region underlying the thick progradational packages of the Nile Delta is highly overpressured, with pressure increasing substantially beneath the Messinian (Dolson, 2020; Dolson et al., 2005). Overpressured gas condensate and reservoir water have been encountered in Miocene sandstones that are \u223c26\u201327.5\u00a0MPa above normal pressure conditions, with even higher pressures recorded in the overlying shales (Dolson, 2020; Heppard and Albertin, 1998). Highly overpressured non-commercial gas discoveries have also been made in Upper Oligocene slope channels (Dolson et al., 2005). The generation of these high pressures has been attributed to a combination of rapid sedimentation and sealing by the Messinian Evaporites, aquathermal processes, hydrocarbon generation and cracking of oil to gas in the lower Miocene to Upper Oligocene (Nashaat, 1994).\n\n\n\n4\nData and methods\nThis study is based on the interpretation of a pre-stack time and depth migrated 3D seismic survey acquired in 2008 by Equinor over an area of 4300\u00a0km2 of the West Nile Deep Sea Fan at water depths of 2500\u20133000\u00a0m (Figs. 1 and 3A). The data were acquired and processed with the objective of high-fidelity imaging of pre-salt exploration targets. Binset dimensions are 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m, resulting in an effective lateral resolution of 25\u00a0m in the post-salt interval. Dominant frequencies in the pre- and post-salt intervals are 20 and 60\u00a0Hz, giving a vertical stratigraphic resolution of c. 40 m and 10\u00a0m, respectively. The data is processed to zero phase and displayed in SEG normal polarity (Brown, 2004), whereby an increase in acoustic impedance across an interface corresponds to a positive excursion on display. Accurate imaging of the Oligo-Miocene is hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio, the occurrence of migration and transmission artefacts (Cartwright et al., 2021), multiples and converted wave interference patterns (Fig. 5A). These introduce some uncertainty into the interpretation of stratal geometries, particularly beneath features with pronounced relief at the base of the salt.\nA number of key marker horizons (Fig. 3B and C) were manually picked and auto-correlated throughout the seismic survey area using Schlumberger's Petrel software package. The regional horizons of PP10, PP20 & PP30 (3.22, 2.59 & 2.16\u00a0Ma respectively) were calibrated using high resolution biostratigraphic data from the NAB-3 exploration well located 100\u00a0km to the southeast of the study area (Fig. 3A and 3C) (Gulmammadov, 2017). Dating precision of this part of the geological time scale is considered to be within a single precession cycle i.e. c. 20 Ka. (Gradstein et al., 2012). However, we estimate the error in correlating these markers from the NAB-3 exploration well to the survey area as \u223c100\u00a0Kyrs based on an assessment of the uncertainty of seismic correlation over the 100\u00a0km distance, and take this value as the error assigned to the dating of all the key marker horizons PP10, PP20 & PP30.\nRMS (root-mean square) amplitude and coherency volumes were generated and interpreted following previously established criteria Cartwright and Santamarina (2015); Moss and Cartwright (2010a), to identify fluid escape pipes (referred to onwards as pipes) and their genetically connected outlets, and pipe trails (Fig. 2).\nThe onset of fluid venting in the pipe trails was established by dating the earliest pockmark or mud volcano (outlets) to form in each trail using dates for correlated marker horizons and extrapolation using average sedimentations rates (uncorrected for compaction). The ages of all subsequent outlets were calculated using the distance the outlet has been offset from the origin, with the origin being where the most recent outlet in the trail is situated (see section 2), divided by the average flow velocity of the salt. This average flow velocity was derived from the age of the outermost outlet and its distance from the origin (Fig. 2) (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021). The average flow velocity of the salt is in the first instance assumed to be constant for the period represented by each pipe trail (see Discussion).\nTo quantify the pressure conditions required for the formation of the pipe trails, we constructed a series of pressure-depth plots for each trail (see Section 5.4 for detailed explanation). The hydrostatic and lithostatic gradients are calculated using the standard formula P\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1.g.h, where P is pressure, \u03c1 (rho) is the liquid or solid density, g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the height of the water or rock column. The hydrostatic gradient was calculated with a seawater density of 1.06\u00a0g\/cc. The lithostatic gradient was calculated using bulk densities taken from nearby exploration wells for the Pliocene to Recent, Messinian Evaporites and Oligo-Miocene of 2.0, 2.13 and 2.35\u00a0g\/cc, respectively. The fracture gradient for the salt was in the first instance assumed to be 2\u00a0MPa below the lithostatic pressure, based on arguments presented in Cartwright et al. (2021) in which the differential stress in the salt was taken as most likely to range between 1 and 3\u00a0MPa (Schoenherr et al., 2007; Weijermars and Jackson, 2014) and where the tensile strength was negligible. These values give a conservative estimate for the fracture gradient within the salt seal unit but significantly higher values are possible (see Discussion).\nPressure-depth plots for the first pipe that formed along the pipe trails are based on depth sections that are reconstructed to the stratigraphic configuration at the timing of the first venting episode. This requires removing an appropriate thickness of the younger overburden to restore the overburden thickness to the interval between the Top Salt and the first pockmark to form along the pipe trail. In the absence of any constraints on palaeo-water depth in the requisite time interval (4\u00a0Ma to Present), we assumed a constant water depth between reconstructed and present-day pressure-depth plots. Modest subsidence is implied by this assumption, and is supported by generally aggradational configurations of the shelf-slope depositional system updip from the study area (Allen et al., 2016; Loncke et al., 2006).\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nSeismic stratigraphy\nThe seismic stratigraphy in the study area is divided here into three informal seismic stratigraphic units, the Pre-Salt (Pliocene-Recent succession), the Messinian Evaporites and the Post Salt (Oligo-Miocene succession). This subdivision is based on contrasts in seismic character, reflection geometries and well calibration and is described in detail below (Figs. 3B and 5A) (Baer et al., 2016).\n\n5.1.1\nPre Salt (Oligo-Miocene succession)\nThe Pre Salt has a wedge-shaped geometry and thins to the SW (Fig. 5A). This unit is sub-divided into two seismic-stratigraphic units, OM1 and OM2, based on contrasting seismic facies, reflection geometrical relationships and gross unit geometry.\nOM1 is the deeper of these units. The basal reflection of the unit is moderate to high amplitude, moderately continuous and is interpreted to represent the top of the Eocene carbonate ramp (Fig. 5A). OM1 is composed of moderate amplitude and parallel reflections that gently dip toward the SE and are divergent to the geometry of the Eocene ramp (Fig. 5A). OM1 reaches thicknesses of 1800\u00a0m in the deep basin to the north and thins onto the Eocene ramp to as little as 200\u00a0m with some evidence of onlap onto the slope (Fig. 5A). The lithology of OM1 is probably composed of marine shales and sandstones confined in stacked channel systems and basin floor fans (Figs. 3B and 4). This sub-unit is host to several extensive and localised high amplitude anomalies that display a gradual reduction in amplitude toward their margins, are an enhancement of reflections with no phase reversal and are not underlain by any velocity artefacts (Fig. 6\n). Amplitude window extractions at the base of OM1 show large anomalies that are distributed N\u2013S and reach up to \u223c20\u00a0km in width (Fig. 6A and B). Amplitude window extractions through some shallower anomalies in OM1 are oriented NNW-SSE\/NW-SE, up to 3\u00a0km wide and display sinuosity in the amplitude distribution (Fig. 6C\u2013E). We interpret these amplitude extractions as Oligocene submarine fan (Fig, 6A) and channel (Fig. 6C) sandstone reservoirs.\nThe base of OM2 (top of OM1) is characterised by a transition toward low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections (Fig. 5A). The lithology of OM2 is dominated by shales (Figs. 3B and 4), which provide the mud source for the hundreds of mud volcanoes in this study area (Fig. 5) (Kirkham et al., 2017). OM2 is bound at its top by the regionally correlatable, high amplitude and acoustically \u2018soft\u2019 reflection of the Base Salt (Figs. 3B and 5A). Some moderate amplitude, parallel and more continuous reflections can be interpreted within the otherwise low coherency unit that are concordant to the reflections in OM1 and discordant to the Base Salt (Fig. 5A). There are no amplitude anomalies in this unit that would be indicative either of significant reservoirs or gas accumulations (Fig. 6B, D, E).\nOM2 generally thickens eastwards across the study area from c. 200 m to >1000\u00a0m (Fig. 5B), but with numerous areas of locally increasing and decreasing thickness that correlate with highs or lows at the Base Salt. The relief on these highs at the Base Salt is up to 1\u00a0km with geometries that form plateaux and generally N\u2013S oriented ridges (Figs. 5B, 7A and 7\nB). The ridges are separated by linear troughs at the Base Salt, that coincide with thinning of OM2 to <100m (Figs. 5, 7A and 7B). Along the flanks of these ridges, the Base Salt subtends angles of between of 3 and 38\u00b0 relative to the more coherent truncated reflections of OM2, implying significant degrees of erosional relief of up to 1000\u00a0m (Figs. 5A and 7B). These N\u2013S depressions or troughs are interpreted as incised valleys or submarine canyons that were cut during the major lowstand at the onset of the Messinian Salinity Crisis and are analogous to similar features mapped further east beneath the Nile Delta (Barber, 1981).\nAnother set of features that can be seen on the Base Salt are a series of prominent circular-elliptical depressions up to a few km across (Figs. 5B, 7C and 7D). These coincide with localized thinning of OM2 and have been interpreted previously as mud volcano depletion zones that formed during the remobilization of mud from OM2 and extrusion at contemporaneous seafloors throughout the Pliocene-Recent (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021; Kirkham et al., 2017).\n\n\n5.1.2\nMessinian Evaporites\nThe top of the Messinian Evaporites is represented by the regionally correlatable, high amplitude and acoustically \u2018hard\u2019 seismic reflection of the Top Salt (Figs. 3B and 5A). The Messinian Evaporites are divided into two sub-units in the study area, a Lower Evaporitic Unit and Upper Evaporitic Unit, based on contrasts in seismic facies and reflection geometry and continuity (Fig. 5A). The Lower Evaporitic Unit is composed of discontinuous and high amplitude reflections interbedded with seismically transparent layers (Fig. 5A). The top of the Upper Evaporitic Unit is discontinuous and represented by a seismic facies transition to almost entirely seismically transparent Upper Evaporitic Unit (Fig. 5A). The contrast in seismic facies between the Upper and Lower Evaporitic Units is attributed to the inclusion of thin clastic layers interbedded in the Lower Evaporitic Unit (Kirkham et al., 2020a; Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021). Long range correlation of these two sub-units to the Levant Basin suggests that the Lower Evaporitic Unit is the lateral equivalent of the reflective intra-salt series in the Levant Basin (ME I\u2013V (Kirkham et al., 2020a; H\u00fcbscher et al., 2007);). The intra-salt reflections in the Levant Basin are equated to thin (1\u20133\u00a0m) layers of diatomaceous claystones interbedded in a dominantly halite succession (Feng et al., 2017; Meilijson et al., 2019). Locally, the Messinian Evaporites thin overlying the erosional highs between the palaeo-valleys and canyons at the Base Salt (Fig. 7B). This thinning is primarily within the Lower Evaporitic Unit (Fig. 7B). Juxtaposition of the Messinian Evaporites with the erosional highs at the Base Salt presents the potential for well-sealed stratigraphic traps (palaeogeomorphic traps).\n\n\n5.1.3\nPost Salt (Pliocene to recent succession)\nThe Post Salt Unit in the study area is located within the distal part of the Nile Deep Sea Fan where sediment deposition is mostly aggradational within a deep-water slope setting (Fig. 3A, C and 5A). It is dominated by laterally continuous and moderate to high amplitude reflections but with local interbedding of channels, channel-levees, and mass transport deposits (Figs. 3B and 5A). The Rosetta Channel cuts across the northeast of the study area, and is prominent at the modern seafloor (Fig. 3A). The Post Salt is deformed by an array of growth faults in the south (Fig. 5A) and these form part of the circum-basin margin growth fault belt, at the head of the extensional domain that developed in response to gravity tectonics from the Late Pliocene onwards (Kirkham et al., 2017; Loncke et al., 2006; Allen et al., 2016). Increased proximity to the western Nile and sediment transport from the Rosetta Channel has led to thickening of the Post Salt (Fig. 3C) from \u223c500 to 1000\u00a0m toward the east of the study area. Nearly 400 mud volcanoes are interpreted within the Post Salt and are all sourced from OM2 (Fig. 5B).\n\n\n\n5.2\nEvidence for fluid escape\n\n5.2.1\nPipes and pockmarks\nWe mapped 382 individual fluid escape pipes with single pockmarks at their outlets in the study area. They are spatially distributed throughout the study area (Fig. 5B) and temporally distributed at several stratigraphic levels from the Early Pliocene to Recent (Fig. 8\n). The pockmarks exhibit classic crater geometry, with excavated relief of 10\u201350\u00a0m and diameters of 70\u2013500\u00a0m (Fig. 8A). The pipes that terminate upwards at these pockmarks transect both the Post Salt and the Messinian Evaporites (Fig. 8A) (c.f. Kirkham et al. (2018b). They cannot easily be traced below the Base Salt (Fig. 8). Amplitude anomalies are frequently observed overlying and adjacent to these pipes and pockmarks (Fig. 8A\u2013C). They have a \u2018soft\u2019 acoustic response, typically display a phase reversal and a strong anomalous amplitude relative to the host stratigraphy with sharp lateral cut-offs of amplitude (Fig. 8B). They are directly underlain by vertical zones of amplitude attenuation and push-down (Fig. 8B). These characteristics lead us to interpret the amplitude anomalies as due to shallow gas (L\u00f8seth et al., 2009; Hammond, 1974).\nThe majority of the 382 pipes mapped in the study area are associated with palaeo-pockmarks signifying that the pipes formed at some time in the Pliocene to Pleistocene (Fig. 8A and D). These older pipes have been deformed by basinward flow of the salt and hence their pockmark outlets are offset a substantial distance from their original expulsion locus. This means that the locus for the fluid expulsion cannot be identified with certainty. However, a small minority (24) of pipes are associated with pockmarks at the present-day seafloor (Figs. 5B and 8A). These have not been offset from their expulsion locus, and it is possible to identify with certainty that these pipes all root to erosional stratigraphic traps at the Base Salt (Figs. 5B, 7B and 8A). These stratigraphic traps have structural relief ranging from 70 to 500\u00a0m in magnitude (\u223c350\u00a0m on average). The erosionally truncated stratigraphy of OM1 and OM2 forming the stratigraphically trapped rock volume is parallel stratified and gently dipping (Figs. 5A, 7B and 8A). Since the 24 fluid escape pipes root to the crests of the stratigraphic traps at the base of the main seal (the Base Salt), we consider that it is the pressure within the uppermost unit juxtaposed against the Base Salt (i.e. OM2) that must be responsible for the fluid leakage. Since fluid escape pipes have been previously equated with hydraulic fracturing, we can also infer that the critical pore fluid pressure condition for pipe formation is met at the crest of these stratigraphically trapped compartments of the OM2 Unit.\n\n\n5.2.2\nPipe trails\nFive separate pipe trails (PT1-PT5; Figs. 9 and 10\n\n) have been identified and mapped in the study area in a previous study in an attempt to constrain the salt kinematics in the area (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021). Their seismic characteristics are only briefly summarised here since our emphasis in this study is to use the trails to analyse the episodicity of the fluid escape phenomena.\nAll 5 pipe trails are all located within the translational domain of the salt basin where there is little contraction or extension and the salt thickness is assumed to have been conserved (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021). The Post Salt has been translated here by the northwesterly flow of the underlying Messinian Evaporites.\nThe development of the pipe trails has been interpreted as due to episodic venting from an underlying highly overpressured source interval, across the Messinian Evaporites but where each pipe and pockmark is passively translated down the salt flow direction (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021). The most recently formed outlet in each pipe trail is positioned at the Seafloor above the crest of a Base Salt fluid expulsion locus (Figs. 8C and 9A). The oldest pipe and outlet in each pipe trail (Pipe 1) also originally formed above the crest of these same Base Salt fluid expulsion loci, but have been offset to the northwest by translation of the Post Salt during salt tectonic deformation (see section 2).\nTrails PT1-PT5 are all mapped as NW-SE trending linear alignments of pockmarks or small mud cones at the outlet to each pipe (Figs. 5B, 9 and 10). The pockmark or mud cone outlets (Fig. 8C and D) young successively in a south-easterly direction towards the locus of eruption (Figs. 9 and 10). The vertical spacing between outlets is relatively continuous in PT2-5 resulting in a gradual shallowing in the stratigraphic position of each successive outlet (Fig. 10A\u2013D). The four most recent outlets in PT1 shallow more acutely due to an increase in sedimentation rate resulting from a shift in the Rosetta channel system in the later Pleistocene (Fig. 9A). The base of outlets 9 and 10 in PT1 are positioned at greater depths than the immediately preceding outlets due to the erosional relief of the pockmarks and local collapse within the pipes vertical zone (Fig. 9A). The pipe trails are poorly imaged in the Messinian Evaporites, with only stacked amplitude anomalies serving to indicate their presence.\nThe early stages of fluid venting in PT1 differs from the other pipe trails in that it is expressed in the form of a dissolution structure in the Post Salt (Fig. 9). This dissolution structure has been interpreted by Kirkham and Cartwright (2021) to have been displaced 5130\u00a0m NW away from the crest of the Kiwi High at the Base Salt by the flowing salt and to have formed via subjacent dissolution at the crest of the Kiwi High (Fig. 9).\n\n5.2.2.1\nDating the fluid expulsion episodes\nThe pipe trails were dated by correlation of each outlet horizon to the chronostratigraphic framework provided by the regionally correlated and age calibrated marker horizons (Fig. 3C; see data and methods). The age of the oldest pipe varies from trail to trail; the oldest is dated as 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma in PT3 (Fig. 8D) (Table 1\n). In each of the five pipe trails, the youngest pipe to form terminates at an outlet at the present-day seabed, implying that leakage has occurred geologically very recently in each case, possibly within the Holocene (Figs. 9A and 10A-D).\nThe distance from the oldest to youngest (present day) outlet in each pipe trail (Figs. 9 and 10) records the translation distances of the flowing salt layer during the time interval of episodic venting through successive pipes in each trail. These translation distances differ from trail to trail because their overall longevity and the local salt flow velocity varies. The translation distances for the five trails range from 3830 to 6330\u00a0m, yielding time averaged flow velocities ranging from 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 to 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 mm\/a (Table 1) (Kirkham and Cartwright (2021).\nThe timing of venting episodes and duration of time between venting episodes varies from trail to trail (Fig. 11\n). Comparisons from trail to trail are facilitated and constrained by high confidence seismic correlation of the PP30 and PP40 horizons in a transect that links all five trails (Figs. 9A and 10A-D). Mapping of these horizons throughout the study area provides an additional two absolute chronostratigraphic markers to correlate groups of pipe outlets from trail to trail, in \u2018windows\u2019 of time (T1 and T2 in Fig. 11) that can be confidently equated from trail to trail. The PP30 horizon is biostratigraphically calibrated (2.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0Ma), whereas the PP40 horizon is not. Dates given for the oldest outlet in the pipe trails are based on average sedimentation rates referenced to the markers with known ages. The age of the other outlets in the pipe trails is based on the translation distance and velocity. PT1-3 show a good correlation between the age calibrated horizon of PP30 and relative dated horizon of PP40 and the outlet dating utilising average salt flow (see methods; Fig. 10). PT4 & PT5 however show mismatches in the timing of PP30 and dating using average flow velocity (Fig. 10). This suggests some localized variability in translation velocity of the Post Salt during the lifetime of PT4 & PT5.\nThe total number of venting episodes per trail ranges from 13 to 27 (Table 1). This is partly due to different longevities of each trail. PT2, 4 & 5 have similar onset timings (2.2\u00a0Ma \u00b1 0.1 Myrs). The number of venting episodes during each time window also varies. Note for example the contrasts in PT2, 3 & 5 during window T1 (Fig. 11). During window T2, there are contrasting numbers of episodes for all five trails (Fig. 11). There is no convincing evidence for synchronicity in venting from trail to trail. They appear to exhibit independent fluid expulsion histories.\nAll five pipe trails exhibit contrasts in the range and average horizontal spacing between pipes, as well as the time range and average time between venting episodes (Table 1). The majority of intervals between venting episodes fall in the range 50\u2013150 Ka (Fig. 12\n). There is no systematic relationship between outlet type, erosional relief of the outlets and outlet spacing (Fig. 11).\n\n\n5.2.2.2\nThe root zone for the pipe trails\nThe locus for seal breach for four of the five pipe trails (PT1, 2, 4 & 5) is similar to that found for the 24 single pipes i.e. a crestal position defined by the depth map of the Base Salt (Figs. 9 and 10). It was not possible to establish the original expulsion locus of PT3, simply because the last expulsion episode extruded a large mud volcano at the present-day seafloor, and the depletion zone associated with this event profoundly altered the Base Salt configuration. Since PT3 is located close to a prominent Base Salt erosional ridge (Fig. 10B and F), we suspect that it, too, emanated from a crestal position at the Base Salt.\nIn contrast with the examples of the 24 individual pipes (Fig. 8A), the roots of the pipe trails are much larger relief features, with structural relief to potential spill of a truncation trap ranging from 520 to 830\u00a0m (Figs. 9 and 10). The largest of these is the Kiwi High which forms the root for PT1 (Fig. 9). OM2 defines the stratigraphic trap configuration within the Kiwi High with a top and lateral seal provided by the Messinian Evaporites as mapped at Base Salt (Fig. 9C). More precisely, it is the Lower Evaporitic Unit that forms the seal at the Base Salt with localised thickness variation, while the Upper Evaporitic Unit remains relatively isopachous across the underlying traps.\n\n\n\n\n5.3\nPressure history reconstruction\nPressure history reconstruction for the pipe trails is based on the widely accepted view that fluid escape pipes form by hydraulic fracturing (Cartwright and Santamarina (2015) and refs therein), and follows the approach adopted by (Cartwright et al., 2021). Hydraulic fracturing is the only conduit-forming process that can viably explain high flux transmission of fluids and even mud across thick evaporite sealing sequences (Kirkham et al., 2018). In the case of the pipe trails in the study area, high fluid fluxes and probably high velocities are implied by the excavation of near surface sediments to form the pockmarks with 10s of meters of relief at the pipe outlets (Fig. 8). Similar arguments apply to those outlets composed of small mud volcanoes where individual fractures within the salt maintained aperture during active extrusion of the highly overpressured mud slurry (Kirkham et al., 2018b).\nImportantly, since the pipes are interpreted to root to the crest of stratigraphic traps as mapped at the Base Salt (Figs. 8A, 9 and 10), the critical fluid pressure for hydraulic fracture propagation across the >1000\u00a0m thick salt layer must have been achieved at the sediments crestal position at the Base Salt within OM2 (Figs. 9 and 10). The pressure conditions can be reconstructed straightforwardly by combining the conditions necessary for hydraulic leakage with the geometry of the leakage position. Using this approach, we reconstructed the pressure history for PT1, 2, 4 and 5, where the pre-salt structure was not modified by later mud extrusion.\nThe reconstructed pressure-depth plot for the largest of the stratigraphic traps, the Kiwi High, is presented to illustrate the approach in detail (Fig. 13\n). Using a modest differential stress of 2\u00a0MPa and negligible tensile strength (0\u00a0MPa; alternatives are discussed in section 6.3.2), a conservative estimate of the pore fluid pressure required to initiate hydraulic failure of the base of the salt for the formation of the most recent pipe in the trail is calculated as 57.4\u00a0MPa (\u00b11\u00a0MPa) (Fig. 13A). This is close to, but just smaller than the total overburden stress at this point.\nSince we find no evidence of local deformation around the stratigraphic traps that formed the loci for episodic venting along the pipe trails, we can reconstruct the pressure conditions extant at the start of each pipe trail. This is straightforward: we simply remove the overburden load added during the period following the first vent in the pipe trail and plot the pressure-depth curve using the same density values for the different units, with a reduced overburden, but a constant water depth (Fig. 13B; see Section 4). For PT1 at the Kiwi High, 335\u00a0m of overburden is removed in the pressure vs depth plot (Fig. 13B). The calculated fracture pressure for the oldest pipe in the trail is therefore 50.7\u00a0MPa (\u00b11\u00a0MPa) (Fig. 13B), considerably less than that required for the most recent pipe to form.\nInitial and final pressure conditions for initiating hydraulic failure of the salt seal for the three other pipe trails where we could make the reconstruction are presented in Table 2\n, and show similar histories to that described for PT1, with a general increase of a few MPa from the onset to the final pipe in each trail.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nThe study area in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan contains an unusually high density of fluid flow features whose formation involves breaching of the thick Messinian salt seal. This observation alone indicates that the Pre-Salt of this area must be anomalously overpressured with respect to neighbouring parts of the basin, where such features are more sporadically developed. This highly dynamic fluid migration from the Pre Salt to the contemporaneous surface occurred as isolated singular foci for pressure venting over a protracted period following the conclusion of the Messinian Salinity Crisis to the present day, so it is reasonable to infer that the anomalous overpressure was inherited from this globally significant environmental event (Al-Balushi et al., 2016; Bertoni and Cartwright, 2015). Within this broader context of intensive pressure venting, the five pipe trails documented here stand out as exceptions in as much as they are the only \u2018valves\u2019 that opened and shut repeatedly over a prolonged period of time.\nThe episodic nature of the venting in these five locations prompts a number of questions, namely, what is the pressure evolution within the pipe trail system, what controls the timing and pressure requirements for episodic venting, what overpressuring mechanism are responsible for the initial overpressure generation and continued pressure recharge?\n\n6.1\nPressure evolution\nThe episodic valving of pressure exhibited by all five trails requires that the pressure conditions for hydraulic leakage must be achieved repeatedly, separated by intervals of 50\u2013250 Ka where the pressure was below this threshold. The episodic fluid venting expressed in the pipe trails exhibits all the characteristics of cyclical pressure valving first modelled by Roberts and Nunn (1995). They envisaged a process involving pressure increase to the threshold for hydraulic fracturing followed by fluid expulsion via the fracture network as the fractures propagate. The fluid expulsion from the overpressured compartment at depth would then result in an almost instantaneous (geologically) pressure drop leading in turn to closure of the fracture network once the pressure at the tip decreased to the fracture closure pressure, assumed to be the minimum stress (c.f. Hubbert and Willis (1957)). Once the fractures have closed, pressure increases again in the overpressured compartment.\nWe envisage a similar sequence of events as those modelled by Roberts and Nunn (1995) to explain the development of the episodic pipe trails in the study area (Fig. 14\n). Fluid pressure within OM2 is considered to have been anomalously high as a result of events linked to the Messinian Salinity Crisis, culminating in the earliest Pliocene reflooding of the Mediterranean (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009). The pressure within the trap must have continued to build steadily upwards through the early to mid Pliocene to the point where an initial pipe formed at the crest of the stratigraphic trap (Pf, fracture pressure; Fig. 14A). The initial fracture network for the pipe propagated upward through the entire salt and claystone overburden. Pressure recovery at the crest of the stratigraphic trap must have been rapid enough to continually provide the volume of fluids and pressure required to fill the porosity of the fractures and continue to drive the propagation of new fractures to the seafloor. This requires the hydraulic diffusivity in the source region to be sufficient to transmit the fluid volume and pressure needed for pressure recovery. The rapid (geologically) venting of fluids decreased the pressure within the stratigraphic trap. Fluid migration through the fracture network ended when the pressure in the stratigraphic trap decreased to the point where the pressure in the connected fluid column at the top of the pipe decreased beneath the fracture closure pressure (Pc; equal to the minimum stress; Fig. 14B). Sediments then buried the outlet for the pipe once venting ended and the north-westerly flowing salt displaced the pipe from above the crestal locus, rebuilding seal integrity overlying the trap. The pressure in the stratigraphic trap would then recharge by whatever pressure building mechanisms were extant immediately prior to the initial pipe formation combined with the type of local recharge mechanism envisaged by Roberts and Nunn (1995) (Pr, pressure recharge; Fig. 14C) (see also Luo and Vasseur (1995)). Pressure recharge in the stratigraphic trap back to the fracture pressure is marked by the formation of the next individual fluid escape pipe and outlet in the pipe trail.\nThis cyclical process is best expressed by some kind of sawtooth pressure evolution (Fig. 15\nA) analogous to oscillations in igneous volcanic activity (Kanno and Ichihara, 2018), geyser eruptions (Hurwitz and Manga, 2017) and mud volcano eruptions (Deville and Guerlais, 2009). A reconstruction of one potential sawtooth pressure evolution for PT1 is presented in Fig. 15A. The pressure-time plot utilises the pressure depth plots for PT1 (Fig. 13) and timing for pipe formation (Fig. 11A) to reconstruct the pressure evolution in the trap (c.f. Cartwright et al. (2021)).\n\n\n6.2\nComparison with previously reported pipe trails\nThe pipe trails described in this study share some similarities to those reported previously from the North Levant Basin (e.g. Fig. 2) by Cartwright et al. (2021) and Oppo et al. (2021b). Both geographical groups of pipe trails involve hydraulic fracture propagation through thick salt layers, that would typically be regarded as highly efficient seals (Fig. 16\n). In addition, the typical range of time intervals between venting episodes is similar in both areas, namely in the 50-250Ka range. However, there are several fundamental differences. The pipe trails in the North Levant Basin root to the crest of anticlinal structural traps from the top of a putative Oligo-Miocene sandstone reservoir in the pre-salt that is juxtaposed with an immediate top seal comprising Miocene claystones (Fig. 16A). By contrast, the pipe trails in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan root to the crest of erosional stratigraphic traps that confine a parallel stratified and dominantly shale Late Miocene succession that is also the overpressured source of hundreds of mud volcanoes in the region, with an immediate top seal of Messinian Evaporites (Fig. 16B). Important contrasts in the overpressure mechanisms for the pipe trails in these two regions are discussed in section 6.4.\nDoes the trap configuration have any influence on the formation of episodic venting features? Reverse faults bound the lateral margins of many of the pre-salt folds in the North Levant Basin (Fig. 16A) (Cartwright et al., 2018, 2021) and it has been proposed that normal faults imaged within the resolution of seismic reflection data that cross-cut these folds could act as barriers or baffles to lateral fluid movement, resulting in partial of fully compartmentalised reservoirs (Oppo et al., 2021b). In the West Nile Deep Sea Fan, enclosure of the parallel stratified OM2 within the erosional stratigraphic traps and juxtaposition with the Messinian Evaporites also forms a potentially effective pressure compartment (Fig. 16B). It is, therefore, reasonable to postulate that compartmentalisation or formation of a pressure compartment may be an important factor to facilitate geologically rapid pressure recharge within a pressure cell (c.f. Moss and Cartwright (2010b)) for episodic venting.\n\nCartwright et al. (2021) considered the fracture pressure (Pf\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c3min\u00a0+\u00a0T; \u03c3min - minimum stress, T - tensile strength) at the top seal as a minimum requirement to initiate hydraulic fracturing and pipe formation, with higher pressures possible. Cartwright et al. (2021) reconstructed the pressure evolution in the trap leading up to and during the period of venting and argued for a similar sawtooth pressure evolution to that inferred in our study in the Herodotus Basin. However, neither Cartwright et al. (2021) nor Oppo et al. (2021) considered in any detail the uncertainties in dating of event, nor in the fracture pressure hence it is hard to evaluate their suggestions for causal mechanisms of initial and subsequent venting against the range of possible overpressuring mechanisms.\n\n\n6.3\nUncertainties in dating and fracture conditions\n\n6.3.1\nDating the expulsion events\nThe main source of error in the analysis of the timing of the episodic venting history is the assumption of a constant salt flow velocity through the venting period. This assumption allows us to use the outlet distance to date individual events. Successive outlets are always at younger horizons, so the individual events always young systematically towards the expulsion locus (Fig. 2) and any deviation from this average velocity cannot violate this condition. In practice, this means we cannot invoke rapid accelerations or decelerations in salt flow. Since the driver for salt flow is regional tilting of the basin (Kirkham and Cartwright, 2021; Zucker et al., 2020), such rapid fluctuations are unlikely.\nIt is conceivable, however, that the salt flow velocity has undergone periods of gradual acceleration or deceleration. Kirkham and Cartwright (2021) interpreted a 10\u201320% increase in translation velocity between the initial formation of the dissolution structure that formed at c. 4 Ma and the onset of the pipe trail in PT1 some 2 million years later. While the potential error due to such gradual changes is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the inter-event durations, the cumulative error through the full venting history of each trail may be significant and potentially explain the observed mismatch for PT4 and PT5 (Fig. 11D and E).\n\n\n6.3.2\nFracture conditions\nThe minimum stress value within the salt and its tensile strength are the two main sources of uncertainty in the estimation of the pressure conditions necessary to initiate propagation of a hydraulic fracture network through the salt. These derive directly from the failure condition, Pf\u00a0>\u00a0\u03c3min\u00a0+\u00a0T (Price and Cosgrove, 1990). In studies dealing with borehole stability whilst drilling through salt, it is common practice to assume that the minimum and maximum stress are equal (\u03c3min\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3max) or that the state of stress is isotropic because the salt behaves as a viscous fluid on geological time scales (Fredrich et al., 2003; Dusseault et al., 2004). However, studies on salt microstructure have been used to argue that there is a probable range of differential stress within flowing salt layers of 1\u20133\u00a0MPa (Schoenherr et al., 2007; Weijermars and Jackson, 2014). This difference in views on the state of stress within thick salt layers should probably be regarded as the uncertainty in the value of \u03c3min.\nThe strength of salt is dependent on the material composition of the salt type, water content, stress conditions and temperature of the salt in situ (Sriapai et al., 2012; Willson and Fredrich, 2005). Estimates of the tensile strength of salt sequences of 1\u20133\u00a0MPa have been made from analyses of extended leak-off tests (B\u00e9rest et al., 2015). A modest value 1.65\u00a0MPa has been cited for the tensile strength of the salt in the Gulf of Mexico from direct tension testing (Willson and Fredrich, 2005). A crude estimate of tensile strength can also be made from practical experience of safe drilling windows through salt. Mud weights at the shoe of a well that is overbalanced by a maximum of 5\u00a0MPa is advised when drilling through intact salt, although <3\u00a0MPa is preferred, to prevent creep whilst also not fracturing the rock (Dusseault et al., 2004). Willson and Fredrich (2005) note that an upper limit for a formation integrity test is set at overburden plus 4\u00a0MPa. This would imply a tensile strength of 5\u20137\u00a0MPa assuming the range of differential stress values taken from Schoenherr et al. (2007) and Weijermars and Jackson (2014). Finally, laboratory measurements of the tensile strength of virtually pure halite at varying temperatures show a linear decrease in salt strength as temperature increases, from \u223c4.8\u00a0MPa to 7.3\u00a0MPa (Sriapai et al., 2012). Taking these different types of estimate together, it is evident that the tensile strength of salt could range from almost zero to about 7\u00a0MPa.\nWhat is clear from this preceding discussion is that despite any uncertainty in the fracture pressure, the pressure conditions required for each venting episode are close to or in excess of the lithostatic pressure (the vertical overburden stress). From the sawtooth history plots shown in Fig. 15B, it is evident that the time between venting episodes is a function of fracture pressure (Pf), fracture closure pressure (Pc) and the pressure recharge rate (Pr\u00a0=\u00a0dp\/dt; dp\u00a0=\u00a0change in pressure, dt\u00a0=\u00a0change in time) to again reach the Pf. The tensile strength is thus the key variable in defining the shape of the sawtooth, with a large tensile strength requiring both a greater pressure drop to reach Pc and subsequently a greater amount of pressure recharge to reach Pf again (Fig. 15B).\n\n\n\n6.4\nOverpressure generation and pressure recharge\nThe pipe trails in the study require the generation of pore fluid pressures close to or even above the lithostatic pressure in the Pre Salt soon after deposition of the Messinian Evaporites. We now discuss the mechanisms that are responsible for generating this pressure and reliably recharging pressure in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan for this episodic venting.\n\n6.4.1\nOverpressure generation during the Messinian Salinity Crisis\nThe Eastern Mediterranean underwent several major phases of unloading and loading during the Messinian Salinity Crisis that must have modified the pore pressure in the Pre Salt (Bertoni and Cartwright, 2015; Al-Balushi et al., 2016). These include (1) an early stage drawdown that has been interpreted to have triggered gas venting at the Base Salt palaeo seafloor (Bertoni et al., 2013); (2) rapid deposition of the regionally sealing Messinian Evaporites, leading to undercompaction of the Pre Salt and high pore-water retention (Kirkham et al., 2017, 2018a); (3) a late Messinian drawdown that led to a phase of thermally driven dissolution at the top of the salt (Kirkham et al., 2020a) (4) rapid seawater loading during the Zanclean flood (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009).\nThe extrusion of giant mud volcanoes\/mud canopies directly on top of the salt (Kirkham et al., 2018a, 2020b) and the continued mud volcanism and fluid venting through the salt immediately following the Messinian Salinity Crisis is a strong indication that overpressure in the upper Miocene in this study area was primed by the loading and unloading events during the Messinian salinity Crisis and has remained highly overpressured over at least the last \u223c5.33 Myrs and possibly prior to this (Fig. 15C). It is reasonable to expect that the stratigraphically trapped compartments of OM2 in the Pre Salt were initially overpressured to near the fracture pressure due to undercompaction (Fig. 15C). Vertical and lateral sealing of the trap by the Messinian Evaporites is likely to have impeded pressure transfer out of the trap (Muggeridge et al., 2004) and resulted in the retention of high pore pressure since the Messinian Salinity Crisis.\n\n\n6.4.2\nPressure recharge mechanisms\nWhilst the overpressure required for a single venting episode can be substantially attributed to the events linked to the Messinian Salinity Crisis, how is pressure in the Pre Salt traps in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan recharged for multi-episode venting? We can exclude several common mechanisms because of the geological context:\n\n(1)\nTectonic compression: interpreted by Cartwright et al. (2018) as a key mechanism for the pipe trail in the North Levant Basin (Fig. 16A). However, there is no evidence of contractional structures in the Pre Salt in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan, nor do the pipes root to the crest of contractional folds.\n\n\n(2)\nPressure Transfer from the deep basin: proposed by Oppo et al. (2021b) as an another key mechanism for the pipe trail in the North Levant Basin. However, the stratigraphic traps in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan consist of low permeability claystones of the shallow dipping OM2 that are confined by truncation to within the erosional margins of the trap and sealed laterally and above by the thick salt layer.\n\n\n(3)\nSea level change: the magnitude of pressure excursions due to eustatic changes in sea level are too small.\n\n\n(4)\nDiagenesis: cannot be completely excluded, but there is no evidence from direct samples taken from the mud volcanoes in the study area for smectite having converted to illite in OM2 (c.f. Giresse et al. (2010)).\n\n\n(5)\nBuoyancy pressure: no evidence for any reservoirs hosting sufficiently thick hydrocarbon columns trapped beneath the salt. However, thermogenic and biogenic methane has been sampled from mud volcanoes in the study area (Prinzhofer and Deville, 2013), suggesting that hydrocarbon generation rather than buoyancy could be a viable mechanism.\n\n\n\nBy elimination therefore, we are left with three possible overpressure generating mechanisms to explain the recharge between venting episodes. A single overpressuring mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for the pressure recharge, but rather a combination of:\n\n(1)\nDisequilibrium compaction \u2013 An important overpressuring mechanism during the Messinian Salinity Crisis due to rapid loading of the salt; but only a minor contributor during the Pliocene-Recent (6\u201310\u00a0MPa\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0MPa) due to low sedimentation rates in a deepwater (3\u00a0km water depth) setting. Disequilibrium compaction cannot increase pore fluid pressure above the lithostatic pressure. Furthermore, whilst gradual loading will have increased pore fluid pressure in the stratigraphic traps as the salt seal impedes dewatering, the lithostatic pressure will also increase making repeatedly reaching the fracture criteria by disequilibrium compaction alone unlikely.\n\n\n(2)\nHydrocarbon generation \u2013 Modelling of the thermal gradient in the Eastern Mediterranean (Al-Balushi et al., 2016) and brine temperatures of up to 57\u00a0\u00b0C recorded from within the Chephren mud volcano in the study area (Dupr\u00e9 et al., 2014) provide an insight into the temperature of the fluids and mud remobilized from OM2. OM2 is thermogenically immature and so the thermogenic gas sampled from the mud volcanoes in this study area (Prinzhofer and Deville, 2013) must have been generated at greater depths in the Pre Salt than the pipe trails root to. OM2 is, however, within the biogenic window and so biogenic gas generation within the appropriate temperature window in the stratigraphically trapped compartments could be a significant source of overpressure. This mechanism has been invoked as a major source of overpressure and linked to the formation of gas venting features elsewhere, but is at present poorly quantified (Tingay et al., 2013; Luo and Vasseur, 1996; Mandl and Harkness, 1987; Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997).\n\n\n3)\nPressure transfer \u2013 Regional pressure transfer laterally along sandstone beds (c.f. Javanshir et al. (2015) and or upward along faults (c.f. Grauls and Baleix (1994)) is unlikely here due to the parallel stratification of the Oligo-Miocene (Figs. 4 and 6), the lateral confinement of the stratigraphic traps (Figs. 8 and 9) and the absence of seismically visible deep rooted faults within the traps. However, evidence for lateral transfer of near-lithostatic overpressure along shallow and low permeability sediments has been increasingly observed (Oppo et al., 2021a). Local pressure re-equilibration in the sense advocated by Roberts and Nunn (1995) and Luo and Vasseur (1995) within the dominantly claystone lithofacies of the OM2 could play an important role. These authors suggested that leakage during a venting episode leads to local de-pressuring beneath the fracture closure pressure (Pc), and after the seal is re-established, the pressure would recharge by equilibration with the surrounding medium whose elevated pressure state (at least\u00a0>\u00a0Pc) was not affected by the leakage. Local pressure transfer will wholly or partially recharge pressure following venting episodes if the volume and hydraulic diffusivity of the surrounding medium permits. However, this mechanism can only eventually recharge the local pressure to that of the surrounding medium. Additional pressure contributions will be required for further venting episodes if the pressure of the surrounding medium is less than the fracture criterion.\n\n\n\nAn intriguing observation is the hundreds of other pipes that emanate from stratigraphic traps at the Base Salt, but result in only a single venting episode in stark contrast to the episodic pipe trails with their history of repetitive venting. This implies that it has not been possible to recharge pressure within their source to the fracture criterion. The reason for this is cryptic, however, the observation that the stratigraphic traps for the pipe trails have significantly greater structural relief than those for the single episode pipes (see Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.2) indicates that trap volume and hydraulic diffusivity may be an important factor. A speculative explanation is that after pressure is diminished locally beneath the structural crest within one of these comparatively small stratigraphic traps following a venting episode there is an insufficient volume of still highly pressured sediments in the trap to recharge the de-pressured cell.\n\n\n6.4.3\nWider implications\nTo date, merely a handful of papers have described direct seismic evidence for episodic venting in sedimentary basins (Andresen and Huuse, 2011; Cartwright et al., 2021; Oppo et al., 2021b; Roberts and Nunn, 1995). An intriguing aspect of the pipe trails here in the western Nile when compared to the pipe trails described in the North Levant Basin (Cartwright et al., 2018; Kirkham et al., 2019; Oppo et al., 2021b) is that the process of episodic salt seal failure and pressure recharge was achieved over comparable periods of time and intervals between venting episodes, but by a seemingly very different set of mechanisms. The pipe trails discussed here demonstrate that these episodic venting phenomena are not uniquely restricted to a single basinal setting and that they may be expected to occur far more widely in other basins with high quality seals. Furthermore, there is no single mechanism that is responsible for the pressure recharge that drives episodic venting, but several are possible and act together, further broadening the potential sedimentary basin setting in which they may be found.\nA unique aspect of the pipe trails in the Eastern Mediterranean is that the lateral offset of pipes and outlets away from their genetically connected root by the flowing salt has made the interpretation of each discrete venting episode relatively straightforward in 3D seismic reflection data. Similar episodic venting phenomena and pressure recharge are almost certain to be present in other basins globally, but may have been overlooked due to the challenges in identifying individual outlets within the vertically disturbed zone of fluid venting (Andresen and Huuse, 2011). The common elements from the small handful of examples that exist are a source region that is highly overpressured to near or supra-lithostatic pressure, trap configurations that are overlain by an effective seal such as salt and are partially or fully compartmentalised, and pressure recharge that is efficient enough to reach the fracture criteria more than once. It is conceivable that regions such as offshore Brazil and Gabon where there are large scale base salt structures may contain similar episodic venting phenomena. Extreme caution should be taken during the planning and drilling of such structures as the Kiwi High due to the hazardously high overpressure therein.\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nA total of 382 individual fluid escape pipes and 5 linear fluid escape pipe trails are distributed throughout the study area in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan. The pipes and pipe trails root to the crest of erosional stratigraphic traps at the Base Salt, transect >1\u00a0km of Messinian Evaporite and terminate upwards at outlets that are either pockmarks or mud cones in the Pliocene to Recent. The pipe trails present evidence of rarely documented multi-episode venting and failure of a thick sealing salt layer. These pipes are formed by hydraulic fracturing of the thick salt and claystone seal and their genesis requires extreme overpressure and efficient pressure recharge in the pre-salt traps.\nThe pressure in the pre-salt traps necessary to form the pipes must have been a magnitude equal to at least the hydraulic failure criteria for the salt seal (Pf\nmin\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3min+T\n). The pressure requirements are near to or potentially above the lithostatic pressure depending on the different stress (\u03c3min) and tensile strength (T) of the salt. The episodic nature of the pipe trails implies that the extreme high pressures that are required for hydraulic failure of the salt seal have been repeatedly achieved every \u223c50\u2013150 kyrs. The pressure evolution in the pre-salt traps over the lifetime of the episodic pipe trails is best expressed by a sawtooth pressure evolution.\nMud volcanoes extruded in the lowermost Pliocene that are sourced from the same pre-salt interval in the study area as the pipes suggest that the Pre Salt was undercompacted and already highly overpressured following the Messinian. Pressure recharge required for episodic venting could be achieved in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan by a combination of biogenic gas generation and pressure transfer within the pre-salt traps, with some minor contribution from disequilibrium compaction.\nPrior to this study, similar pipe trails had only been interpreted in the North Levant Basin. The pipe trails in the West Nile Deep Sea Fan widen the recognition of these episodic venting phenomena beyond a single basin and suggests that their genesis can be achieved by contrasting trap, reservoir and seal configurations and pressure recharge mechanisms. Salt has often been considered as a \u2018perfect\u2019 seal in hydrocarbon systems, however, the pipe trails demonstrate that it is possible to repeatedly breach a thick salt layer over a period of a few million years. This has significant implications for prospect de-risking during pre-salt hydrocarbon exploration, as well as pre-salt CO2 storage and hydrogen storage in salt caverns. These episodic venting features show that extreme overpressure can be maintained within this type of trap and seal configuration and presents a significant hazard while drilling. Similar venting features should be present in other basins globally with analogous trap and seal configurations and suitably efficient pressure recharge mechanism. We expect that future works will broaden the global recognition of these episodic venting phenomena and further our understanding of the type of basin settings, overpressuring mechanisms and palaeo and recent overpressure at depth.\n\n\nData availability statement\nThe data used for this research is confidential industry seismic reflection data and cannot be shared.\n\n","97":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe onset of the Quaternary Ice Age \u223c2.6\u00a0Ma was characterised by a shift from fluvial to mainly glacigenic sediment delivery on the Northeast Atlantic margin, alongside a corresponding increase in the rate of sedimentation (Dowdeswell et al., 2010; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). Beyond western Norway, rapid onshore and near-coastal erosion by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet resulted in the deposition of a thick (up to 2\u00a0km) succession of Quaternary sediments, termed the Naust Formation, in the North Sea and M\u00f8re basins (Anell et al., 2012; Ottesen et al., 2018).\nOur understanding of the Quaternary geological evolution of the northern North Sea margin (Fig. 1\n) has been improved significantly by the recent availability of regional 3D seismic datasets that image the Quaternary succession at high resolution (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Th\u00f6le et al., 2014; Reinardy et al., 2017; Arfai et al., 2018; Bellwald et al., 2020; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021). However, reliable and precise chronostratigraphic control on these sediments is generally lacking.\nIn addition to poor sampling with few long cores and side-wall cores, it is difficult to obtain good absolute ages for the Quaternary sediments because of sediment reworking and fossil re-sedimentation, few recorded first and last occurrence microfossil events, and a low 87Sr\/86Sr gradient that renders Strontium isotope analyses generally unreliable for this interval (Eidvin et al., 2020). As a result, published intra-Quaternary age estimates typically span broad periods of time, are based on long-distance ties, and involve assumptions about a lack of sediment reworking (Sejrup et al., 1995; Lekens, 2001; Head et al., 2004; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005, 2007; Kuhlmann and Wong, 2008; Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; De Schepper and Mangerud, 2017; Reinardy et al., 2017).\nRobust basin infill patterns with reliable Quaternary age estimates are needed to reconstruct the glacial history of the North Sea and its surrounding land masses (Sejrup et al., 1995; Mangerud et al., 2011; Rea et al., 2018; Batchelor et al., 2019), and to understand and model the evolution of hydrocarbon systems in the North Sea Basin (Kubala et al., 2003; Moss et al., 2003). The Naust Formation sediments host several gas discoveries, including the Peon gas discovery and Aviat field (Mikalsen, 2015; Rose et al., 2018a, 2018b), contain numerous shallow gas pockets and are the seal for CO2 sequestration in the underlying Utsira Formation (Halland et al., 2014; Lloyd et al., 2021). Rapid Quaternary sedimentation and subsidence along this margin has had an important effect on hydrocarbon migration paths and the tilting of fluid contacts. For example, high Quaternary sedimentation rates led to the rapid build-up of fluid pressure, the formation of intrusive and extrusive sand injectites (L\u00f8seth et al., 2012, 2013) and an increase in basin temperature, whilst offshore subsidence and onshore and near-coast glacial erosion tilted the basin margin westward (Riis and Fjeldskaar, 1992). The Troll Field (Fig. 1), where the pre- or early Quaternary paleo oil-water-contact now tilts westward, is a prime example of a reshaped structural closure (Horstad and Larter, 1997; Medvedev et al., 2019). In the absence of reliable age estimates for the Quaternary sediments of the North Sea, the Naust Formation is often treated as a single event spanning \u223c2.6 million years (e.g., Kubala et al., 2003), limiting our ability to model spatial and temporal patterns of basin subsidence, uplift and tilt.\nHere we use high-resolution 3D seismic data to map and interpret seismic horizons and units within the Quaternary Naust Formation across a \u223c500\u00a0km-long section of the northern North Sea (Fig. 1). We examine the detailed patterns and processes of sedimentation along this margin and identify the main sediment supply sources. These data are used to develop a new, regionally consistent seismic-stratigraphic framework for the Quaternary sediments of the northern North Sea, and to assess the correspondence between existing age estimates.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe main study area is located in the northern North Sea intra-cratonic basin and M\u00f8re Basin (\u223c60\u00b0N to 63\u00b0N) between the Norwegian mainland and the East Shetland Platform (Fig. 1). Huge compressive stresses uplifted Norway, the British Isles and the Shetland Platform during the Miocene, raising and exposing their flanking shelves with a subsiding basin forming between (Riis, 1992; Riis and Fjeldskaar, 1992; L\u00f8seth and Henriksen, 2005; Hillis et al., 2008; Japsen et al., 2014; L\u00f8seth et al., 2017). The Miocene and Pliocene sand-rich Skade and Utsira formations were deposited in this basin mainly from the East Shetland Platform and partly from the coast of western Norway (Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020; Lloyd et al., 2021).\nThe inception of the Quaternary Ice Age \u223c2.6\u00a0Ma was accompanied by deposition of the predominantly glaciomarine sediments of the Naust Formation, which has been subdivided into units A (oldest) to D (youngest) (Figs. 2 and 3\n\n) (Ottesen et al., 2009, 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). Grounded ice first extended to the palaeo-shelf break beyond western Norway close to the onset of the Quaternary Period (Ottesen et al., 2014; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). The arcuate geometry of the earliest Quaternary clinoform sediments and their radial glacigenic debris-flows indicate that a lobe from a large outlet glacier initially extended through Sognefjord (Figs. 1 and 2) and spread into an arc on the relatively flat shelf (L\u00f8seth et al., 2020).\nDuring the early Quaternary (\u223c2.6\u20130.8\u00a0Ma), the shelf break beyond western Norway continued to build out in a west to north-westerly direction until the deep marine basin was infilled at approximately 62\u00b0N (Fig. 2) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017). During this time, eastward-flowing rivers on the East Shetland Platform simultaneously delivered sediments to an east to northeast-prograding delta \u223c60\u00b0N (Fig. 2) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021). The rapid progradation of glacial sediments during the early Quaternary triggered the build-up of fluid pressure in the subsurface, causing re-mobilization of a large volume of sand. Sand injectites up to 150\u00a0m thick force-folded the overburden into seafloor mounds, including above the Visund Field (Fig. 1) (L\u00f8seth et al., 2013). Large volumes of extrusive sand, up to 120\u00a0m thick, were deposited between and around the mounds above the Snorre Field (L\u00f8seth et al., 2012). The deep marine basin in the southern and central North Sea also became infilled by mainly fluviodeltaic mud-rich sediments during the early Quaternary, with the final infilling of the central basin taking place by \u223c1\u00a0Ma (Kuhlmann and Wong, 2008; Ottesen et al., 2014; 2018; Reinardy et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2018).\nFollowing the infilling of the North Sea Basin, the focus of sediment deposition shifted to the M\u00f8re Basin to the north (Fig. 1) (Ottesen et al., 2014; Batchelor et al., 2017). The Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, which has been suggested to have been initiated \u223c0.8\u00a0Ma (Ottesen et al., 2014) or excavated at \u223c1.1\u00a0Ma (Sejrup et al., 1995, 2000), eroded a significant amount of the underlying sediments and basement rocks, forming an Upper Regional Unconformity (URU) across much of the northern North Sea (Fig. 2b). The Norwegian Channel Ice Stream deposited a large volume of sediment in the North Sea Trough-Mouth Fan (TMF) during the full-glacial periods of the mid-to late Quaternary. The North Sea TMF sediments contain numerous stacked glacigenic debris-flows, together with Mass-Transport Deposits (MTDs) from four major submarine slides (Stad, M\u00f8re, Tampen, Storegga) (Fig. 2b) (King et al., 1996; Sejrup et al., 1996; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Hjelstuen and Grinde, 2016; Bellwald et al., 2020). A series of relatively flat-lying sediments overlie the URU within the Norwegian Channel (Rise et al., 2008) (Fig. 2b). These sediments comprise tills and glaciomarine clays (Sejrup et al., 1995, 2003), as well as the glaciofluvial Peon sand reservoir (Fig. 1) (Ottesen et al., 2012; Mikalsen, 2015).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nThis study mainly uses the 3D time-migrated CGGNVG2018 broadband (BroadSeis) seismic cube, which covers 35,000\u00a0km2 of the northern North Sea between \u223c60\u00b0N and 62\u00b0N (Figs. 1 and 2). The 16,000\u00a0km2 AMS17 cube was used to extend seismic coverage in the M\u00f8re Basin, whilst more limited extents of other 3D and 2D seismic datasets were used to enable seismic ties to other regions (Fig. 1). The CGG survey inline (N\u2013S) and crossline (E-W) grids are 18.75\u00a0m and 12.5\u00a0m. The vertical sampling is 4\u00a0ms and the bandwidth is up to 90\u00a0Hz in the upper part of the survey studied here. The AMS17 inline (WNW-ESE) and crossline (NNE-SSW) grids are 18.75\u00a0m and 12.5\u00a0m, with a vertical sampling rate of 4\u00a0ms and a bandwidth of up to 90\u00a0Hz in the studied part of the survey. Completion logs from wells show that the Quaternary sediments have only a slightly higher interval velocity than 2000\u00a0ms\u22121, thus 1\u00a0ms is assumed to correspond to 1\u00a0m in the seismic profiles. By comparison to available pre-stack depth migrated seismic data, this method underestimates the Naust Formation thickness by \u223c6%. The interval velocity of sea water is 1480\u00a0ms\u22121. The original CGG survey did not cover areas around installations, so the final 3D seismic cube includes older 3D cubes spliced into the data gaps.\nWe interpreted 23 seismic horizons within the CGGNVG2018 and AMS17 regional 3D surveys between the base-Quaternary and the seafloor (Fig. 2) (Table 1\n). The interpreted horizons were chosen because they are laterally continuous, high-amplitude and\/or reflect important geological events in the Quaternary evolution of the margin. The seismic interpretation software PETREL\u2122 was used to pick reflections. The reflections were interpreted on a grid of inlines and crosslines, with narrow spacing (every 8th crossline) where reflections are faint or discontinuous and with wider spacing (every 64th to 256th crossline) where the reflections are high amplitude and continuous. Some of the horizons were interpreted across the 3D datasets using PETREL\u2122 auto-track operations within a bounding polygon, before being gridded to surfaces. Root Mean Square (RMS), maximum or minimum amplitudes and variance values were extracted along depositional surfaces and at specified windows to show the distribution and characteristics of geomorphological features. The seismic data are shown in zero phase, whereby a positive amplitude (blue-black in colour seismic displays or black in black-white colour scale) is a downward increase in acoustic impedance.\nData derived from wire-line well logs were used to support geological interpretations and aid seismic-reflection correlation across the northern North Sea (Fig. 1). The well logs were analysed using a standard in-house procedure for linking wells to seismic data. We did not use the ages that were assigned to the Naust Formation and underlying Utsira Formation sediments in completion logs due to the likely disturbance and re-sedimentation of the fossils in these intervals (Piasecki et al., 2002; Eidvin et al., 2020). Instead, the results from previously published multi-well biostratigraphic studies and seismic sequence stratigraphic principles were used to assign age estimates to these units (Fig. 3) (e.g., Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; De Schepper and Mangerud, 2017; Reinardy et al., 2017; Eidvin et al., 2020).\n\n\n4\nResults \u2013 seismic stratigraphy and geological interpretations\n\n4.1\nInterpreted seismic horizons and sequence of relative age\nThe 23 seismic horizons that are mapped in the 3D seismic cubes are shown in Table 1, alongside information about their reflection type (peak or trough), extent and maximum number of peak reflections to the underlying interpreted horizon. Our naming convention follows the seismic-stratigraphic framework of Ottesen et al. (2014, 2018), who divided the Naust Formation sediments of the northern North Sea into four major units, A to D (Figs. 2 and 3). We adjust the top Unit A and top Unit B horizons of Ottesen et al. (2018, their Fig. 8) to better fit the high-amplitude reflections imaged using our 3D seismic data. The top of Unit C is picked at a similar position to in Batchelor et al. (2017), which is slightly higher than in Ottesen et al. (2018), to include all of the contourite reflections within Unit C. To add a new level of detail to this framework, we define sub-horizons within each major unit. The sub-horizons were picked as high-amplitude, regionally continuous reflections and are labelled numerically, with 1 as the oldest (Fig. 2) (Table 1). The subdivision of Unit D uses previous published nomenclature (i.e. Stad, M\u00f8re, Tampen and Storegga MTDs) (King et al., 1996; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005), and the top and base reflections of each MTD are mapped. We define two high-amplitude, regionally continuous reflections above the URU \u2013 the Intra Norwegian Channel (INC) \u22121 and \u22122 reflections (Table 1). These two horizons are tied to shallow core 8903 above the Troll Field (Figs. 1 and 4\n) (Sejrup et al., 1995) and are mapped northward to the North Sea TMF (Fig. 5\n and Supplementary Figure 1).\nAmplitudes extracted from an arbitrary near-horizontal surface that cuts many of our sub-horizon clinoforms (red line in Fig. 2b) show how the Naust Formation consists mainly of west-to northwest-prograding sediments derived from western Norway (Fig. 2a) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). The extracted amplitudes show the position of each clinoform-intersection as a continuous reflection-line. The plan-form reflections in Fig. 2a describe a pattern similar to growth rings in trees, which we term \u201cstratigraphic growth rings\u201d, that represents the Pliocene to Quaternary sedimentary infill of the study area. Collectively, the intra-Naust Formation horizons that are shown in Fig. 2 define a set of relative ages for most of the Quaternary sediments in the northern North Sea and M\u00f8re Basin: beneath the URU, younger sediments to the northwest of the margin generally rest upon older sediments to the east.\nEstablishing the source of sediment supply for each of the mapped Quaternary units is essential to develop a robust relative age model. In the following sections, we describe the seismic characteristics of the mapped surfaces and units and provide geological interpretations.\n\n\n4.2\nBase-quaternary\nThe base-Quaternary horizon is a composite surface that variably assumes the top of the glauconitic Utsira Formation where it is present, the top of the Utsira and Utsira East formations where they are present, the mid Miocene Unconformity (MMU) and the URU (Figs. 2b and 4a). Where the lowermost Quaternary \u201cBasal Pleistocene Unit\u201d is present, the base-Quaternary defines the interface between this unit and the underlying Utsira Formation or older sediments (Fig. 2b). Detailed rock property analyses of well data show that the top of the glauconitic Utsira Formation sand (up to 50\u00a0m thick) has very weak to no acoustic contrast with the overlying sand, silt and clay of the Basal Pleistocene Unit (\u00d8ygarden et al., 2015). The high-amplitude soft MMU reflection is therefore the practical seismic approximate for the base-Quaternary horizon in the central part of the northern North Sea (Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; L\u00f8seth et al., 2013; \u00d8ygarden et al., 2015). The MMU also defines the base-Quaternary on the south-eastern flank of the northern North Sea, where the Utsira Formation East is not present (Figs. 2 and 4a). Because the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream eroded and removed a large amount of the underlying sediments, the URU is synonymous with the base-Quaternary horizon across much of the eastern Norwegian Channel (Fig. 4a). In contrast to the eastern margin, where the inception of the Quaternary Ice Age corresponded with a significant shift in the type of sediment input (L\u00f8seth et al., 2020), a similar shift is not observed beyond the East Shetland Platform to the west (Fig. 4a). The position of the base-Quaternary horizon beyond the East Shetland Platform is therefore not identified confidently in the south-western part of the study area (Fig. 2a).\n\n\n4.3\nBasal Pleistocene Unit\nA near-base-Quaternary horizon is picked as the downlap surface of the prograding Naust Formation clinoforms (Table 1 and Fig. 2b). It is only present where it defines the top of the Basal Pleistocene Unit in the central northern North Sea (Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; Ottesen et al., 2009; L\u00f8seth et al., 2013; \u00d8ygarden et al., 2015; Eidvin et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021; Lloyd et al., 2021). This horizon is expressed mainly as a downward reduction in acoustic impedance, but its amplitude varies with changing underlying and overlying sediments.\nThe Basal Pleistocene Unit is interpreted to contain deep-marine basin floor sediments that did not receive direct clastic input from the western Norwegian margin. Numerous dropstones within cores taken from this unit show that a marine-terminating ice margin was present in western Norway during this time (Ottesen et al., 2009; Eidvin et al., 2020). Sand layers within the Basal Pleistocene Unit are interpreted to have been extruded to the seafloor from underlying sand injectites (L\u00f8seth et al., 2012, 2013) and were probably re-distributed by basin floor-currents (Eidvin et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.4\nUnit A\nUnit A records the initial build-out of sediments from western Norway into the northern North Sea Basin following the inception of the Quaternary Ice Age (L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). Sub-horizons A1 to A5 are mapped along continuous reflections that can be traced confidently on both seismic sections (e.g. Fig. 2b) and plan-view amplitude maps (e.g. Fig. 2a). Due to erosion of the Norwegian Channel by the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, progressively more of the older Unit A sediments have been removed towards the east (Table 1 and Fig. 4a). As a result, only the most distal downlapping parts of A1, which is the oldest preserved continuous reflection above the base-Quaternary, exist beneath the URU (Fig. 2). In plan-view, Unit A describes a lobate semi-circle geometry that has its most westerly extent at \u223c60\u00b045\u2032N, 73\u00a0km southwest of the mouth of Sognefjord (Fig. 2a). Within Unit A, the sub-horizons record a gradual expansion of the sedimentary depocentre towards the west, north and south. An attribute map extracted between A1 and A2 shows that the oldest preserved Quaternary palaeo-slope surfaces are incised by narrow linear channels that extend in a down-slope direction (Fig. 6\na and f). Similar linear features are observed on all of the Unit A sub-horizons. The A3 surface attribute map shows particularly well-imaged down-slope linear structures that include both narrower and wider channels (Fig. 6b and g).\nThe down-slope channels imaged on Unit A sub-horizons (Fig. 6a, b, f and g) are interpreted as glacial turbidite channels formed by the remobilisation of glacial sediments and meltwater delivered by grounded ice to the palaeo-shelf break (e.g. King et al., 1996; Taylor et al., 2002; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Bellwald et al., 2020). The plan-view concave geometry of Unit A (Fig. 2a) shows that grounded ice originally extended from Sognefjord to cover part of the palaeo-continental shelf beyond western Norway close to the onset of the Quaternary (L\u00f8seth et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.5\nUnit B\nUnit B describes the continued westerly build-out of Quaternary sediments into the northern North Sea (Fig. 2). This unit extends to the south beyond our 3D seismic dataset, where it fills in part of the marine strait at \u223c60\u00b0N that separates the northern and central North Sea basins (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018). The top of Unit B is the oldest prograding clinoform to extend into this marine strait before the connection became closed by subsequent sediment infilling. Unit B becomes narrower to the north of the study area and was not traced with confidence north of 62\u00b0N (Fig. 2a). The two sub-horizons that are defined within Unit B, B1 and B2, follow continuous to discontinuous reflections with varying high to low amplitudes (Table 1). The highest amplitudes are in the upper to middle part of the prograding clinoforms. Attribute maps from intra-Unit B surfaces show a series of narrow linear, subparallel channels that extend down the length of each clinoform (Fig. 6c and h).\nThe linear channels within Unit B (Fig. 6c and h) are interpreted as glacigenic debris-flows and\/or water-rich turbiditic channels (e.g. King et al., 1996; Taylor et al., 2002; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Bellwald et al., 2020). These channels were sourced from grounded ice that terminated along at least a 250\u00a0km-long section of the palaeo-shelf edge beyond western Norway. The thin and narrow deposit of Unit B that exists north of 62\u00b0N suggests that minimal glacial sediments were delivered from the north-western (M\u00f8re) part of the margin, including from Nordfjord, during this time (Fig. 2a).\nThe western margin of the northern North Sea Basin was infilled by sediments derived from the East Shetland Platform during roughly the same period of time as units A and B were deposited along the eastern basin flank (Figs. 2a and 4a) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021). The sand-rich sediments building out from the East Shetland Platform are interpreted as deep-marine turbiditic deposits derived from rivers that crossed the exposed shelf during the early-mid Quaternary (Batchelor et al., 2021; Lloyd et al., 2021). The relative age between the eastward-prograding East Shetland Platform clinoforms and the westward-prograding clinoforms from Norway can be partly established on east-west seismic profiles in the southern part of the study area (Fig. 4a). Here, sequences of eastward-prograding continuous reflections from the East Shetland Platform, often bounded by a top trough and base peak reflection, interfinger with surface B1 and younger clinoforms. Relative ages cannot be established for the earliest Quaternary clinoforms because they are present only on the respective flanks and do not interfinger (Figs. 2a and 4a).\n\n\n4.6\nUnit C\nThe five sub-horizons of Unit C (C1 to C5) show how the remaining part of the northern North Sea Basin became infilled with sediments (Fig. 2). The sub-horizons are mapped with confidence along mostly continuous reflections, although some of the clinoforms become diffuse as they approach the East Shetland Platform (Fig. 4a). The oldest sub-horizon, C1, can be traced southwards to \u223c60\u00b030\u2032N, where it merges with the northeast-prograding units from the East Shetland Platform (Fig. 2a). This marks the final closing of the deep-marine strait that connected the northern and central North Sea basins. The plan-view pattern of the younger horizons within Unit C shows how the overall direction of sediment progradation then shifted to the northwest, leading to the complete infilling of the northern North Sea Basin by the top of Unit C at \u223c62\u00b0N (Fig. 2a).\nAttribute maps extracted along intra-Unit C surfaces show similar geomorphological patterns to the underlying B and A surfaces, with high-amplitude reflections in the upper and middle parts of the prograding clinoforms and numerous sub-parallel linear channels (Fig. 6d and i). The channels are interpreted as glacigenic turbidite channels that were formed by the down-slope flow of glacial sediments and meltwater from a linear source along the palaeo-shelf break (e.g. King et al., 1996; Taylor et al., 2002; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Bellwald et al., 2020). The geometry of Unit C, combined with the distribution of the glacial turbidite channels, shows that grounded ice reached a broad area of the shelf break beyond western and north-western Norway during this time, including beyond Nordfjord on the M\u00f8re margin (Fig. 2a).\nSeveral of the prograding clinoforms of Unit C are characterised by zones of bright amplitudes along their lower parts (Figs. 2b and 6i). These bright amplitude zones have been tied to sand-rich intervals (low gamma ray values) in wells (Batchelor et al., 2017, 2021). The sands are interpreted as fan deposits produced when glacigenic debris-flows reached the basin floor and were redistributed by contour currents (Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; Eidvin et al., 2014; Batchelor et al., 2021). The appearance of these sand layers within Unit C shows that the current pattern in the northern North Sea changed once the deep-marine strait to the central\/southern North Sea became closed. Local sand-rich intervals, interpreted as extrusive sand, also exist between mounds above the Snorre Field within Unit C (Fig. 1) (L\u00f8seth et al., 2012).\n\n\n4.7\nUnit D\nThe top of Unit C\/base of Unit D corresponds with the base of the North Sea TMF (Fig. 2) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017). The sub-horizons that are mapped within Unit D mark the tops and bases of three major sediment slides (Table 1) and record the progradation of sediment in a north-northwest direction into the M\u00f8re Basin (Fig. 2a). The sediments of the North Sea TMF have been described in detail in previous investigations, where they have been shown to comprise mainly glacigenic debris-flows\/glacial turbidite channels, together with intervening MTDs relating to major submarine slides (Fig. 2b) (Hjelstuen et al., 2004; Bryn et al., 2005; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Hjelstuen and Grinde, 2016; Bellwald et al., 2020). The structures associated with the top of the Tampen Slide are remarkably well-imaged in our 3D seismic data (Fig. 7\n\n). These structures include the Tampen slide scar and side wall, as well as sub-parallel curvilinear ridges and depressions that are interpreted as detached slide blocks (e.g. Barrett et al., 2021).\nAlthough most of the Unit D sediments are contained within the \u223c1.5\u00a0km-thick North Sea TMF, a thinner succession exists above the URU within the Norwegian Channel (Fig. 2b). In the following sections, we describe and interpret three of the major regional surfaces within the Norwegian Channel - the URU, INC-1 and INC-2 horizons \u2013 followed by their intervening sediment units (Figs. 4, 5 and 8).\n\n4.7.1\nUpper Regional Unconformity (URU)\nThe URU is a regional angular erosion unconformity that cuts various subcropping layers and is overlain by continuous near-parallel reflections (Figs. 4, 5 and 8). The URU surface describes a north-south-elongated trough that marks the base of the Norwegian Channel (Fig. 1). It is bounded by the \u00d8ygarden Fault Zone and crystalline basement rocks to the east and has a westward shallowing edge (Fig. 4a). The amplitude and continuity of the URU varies with shifting underlying lithologies; it is mostly a soft trough reflection but can be weaker locally (Fig. 4).\nThe Norwegian Channel was formed by a fast-flowing ice stream of the southern Scandinavian Ice Sheet, which extended to the palaeo-shelf break in the M\u00f8re Basin (Sejrup et al., 1995; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005). The fast ice flow eroded a significant amount of the underlying Quaternary and older sediments and crystalline bedrock (Figs. 3 and 4). The Peon sand at \u223c62\u00b0N (Fig. 8), which is interpreted as a glaciofluvial outwash fan (Ottesen et al., 2012; Mikalsen, 2015), was deposited on top of the URU during a subsequent period of ice-sheet retreat.\nThe URU is mapped continuously to north of \u223c62\u00b0N on our 3D and 2D seismic data, northward of which there is no further obvious truncation of underlying units (Fig. 5a\u2013c and Supplementary Figure 1). The URU surface dips gently northwards within the Norwegian Channel (Fig. 5a), with an average gradient of 0.036\u00b0 between the Troll Field at 60\u00b038\u02caN and close to the present-day shelf break at \u223c62\u00b0N (119\u00a0m\/188\u00a0km).\n\n\n4.7.2\nIntra-Norwegian Channel 1 (INC-1) horizon\nThe INC-1 horizon is a peak reflection that corresponds with the boundary between units L6 (till) and L5 (marine clay) of Sejrup et al. (1995) in core 8903 in the Troll Field (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Figure 1). It is a relatively high-amplitude and continuous reflection across most of the Norwegian Channel, although its amplitude dims below gas-charged sediments (Figs. 5a and 8). INC-1 can be traced north of 62\u00b0N to the termination of the URU within the North Sea TMF (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figure 1), which enables us to establish the relative age between the intra-Norwegian Channel sediments and those of the TMF (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005). Here, our seismic data suggest that INC-1 corresponds with the upper surface of unit P8 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005), which is cut by and hence predates the M\u00f8re Slide.\nThe headwall of the M\u00f8re Slide formed a sharp shelf edge with pronounced incisions (Fig. 5). An amplitude map of the interval immediately above the INC-1 surface shows that elongate curvilinear channels with tributaries extend towards and converge into these shelf-edge incisions (Fig. 5d). These elongate features are interpreted as conduits for glacigenic debris-flows and\/or turbidite feeder channels (Hjelstuen and Grinde, 2016; Bellwald et al., 2020). The deflection of these channels towards the M\u00f8re Slide incisions suggests that they were formed after the M\u00f8re Slide. The unit filling in the slide scarp correlates with units P6 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005) within the North Sea TMF and L4 of Sejrup et al. (1995) in core 8903 (Fig. 5).\n\n\n4.7.3\nIntra-Norwegian Channel 2 (INC-2) horizon\nThe INC-2 horizon is a high-amplitude trough reflection that corresponds with the boundary between units L5 (marine clay) and L4 (till) of Sejrup et al. (1995) in core 8903 (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Figure 1). The reflection is continuous throughout most of the study area and can be traced to the North Sea TMF, where it downlaps onto INC-1 (Fig. 5a\u2013c). INC-2 dips slightly northwards from core 8903 towards the M\u00f8re Basin (0.043\u00b0 (140\u00a0m\/188\u00a0km)) (Fig. 5a). Although the INC-2 reflection becomes diffuse north of 62\u00b0N, the overlying reflections become stronger, making the northward tie from core 8903 almost to the to the termination of the URU robust (Fig. 5a).\nThe INC-2 surface has a strong geomorphological imprint with two regions, R1 and R2, of distinctively different character (Fig. 9\na). Region R1 extends across the eastern half of the Norwegian Channel, from west of Bergen in the south to west of Nordfjord in the north. Within region R1, INC-2 is pervasively moulded into fan-shaped bundles of grooves, which are stacked horizontally towards the west and north, as shown in part by Rise et al. (2004). Along the northern and western edge of R1, our high-resolution seismic data reveal that each bundle terminates in a set of margin-parallel curved reflection bands (Fig. 9d).\nThe dimensions of the grooves in region R1, combined with their orientation perpendicular to the curved compressional bands (Fig. 9a and d), suggests that they were formed by coherent blocks being dragged along at the base of the debris flows. Features of similar dimensions and morphology have been observed below submarine landslides, where they have been linked to the transport of mega-clasts (e.g. Hodgson et al., 2018). The grooves on horizon INC-2 are denoted Basal Debris Flows Grooves (BDFGs) (Fig. 9d). The clear seismic expression of the BDFGs as bundles is attributed to their erosion into and moulding of the soft substratum, which includes the underlying marine clay of unit L5 of Sejrup et al. (1995) (Fig. 9c). The glacigenic debris-flows are interpreted to have compensationally stacked themselves across the low-gradient INC-2 surface as they extended towards the west and north. The broad extent of the R1 glacigenic debris-flow package (Fig. 9c) suggests that grounded ice was nearby and actively supplying sediment. In effect, the analysed glacigenic debris-flow unit resembles a grounding-zone wedge (e.g. Batchelor and Dowdeswell, 2015), which is in agreement with the interpretation of the overlying unit L4 as till (Fig. 9c) (Sejrup et al., 1995). The curved reflection bands identified at the termination of the BDFGs are interpreted as compressional structures formed by glacigenic debris-flows decelerating, analogous to features that have been observed for debris flows on the mid-Norwegian margin (Laberg et al., 2012) and in Spitsbergen fjords (Dowdeswell et al., 2016).\nRegion R2 is west of region R1 and is dominated by NNW-SSE linear ridges and depressions (Fig. 9a). Core 8903 is located in an area of pervasive NNW-SSE lineaments, in the centre of a >15\u00a0km-long lineation (Fig. 9b). The ridges and depressions on INC-2 are also observed on seismic profiles (Fig. 4b). The R2 region of INC-2 has a more erosive character than the R1 region, which increases westward. The R2 lineations cut and are therefore younger than the R1 grooves (Fig. 9a). The elongation (length to width) ratios of the R2 lineations are compatible with MSGLs that are formed by fast, ice-streaming flow (e.g. Clark, 1993).\nCollectively, the geomorphological features identified on INC-2 (Fig. 9) record the well-preserved basal imprint of an ice sheet that advanced initially from the Norwegian coastline to an ice-marginal position west of Nordfjord, forming the BDFGs and compressional bands of R1. The ice sheet then underwent a subsequent phase of ice-streaming flow through the Norwegian Channel to the north, forming the R2 MSGLs.\n\n\n4.7.4\nUnit between the URU and INC-1\nThe unit between the URU and INC-1 horizons corresponds with unit L6 in core 8903 in the Troll Field (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Figure 1), which has been interpreted previously as till (Fedje Till) (Sejrup et al., 1995). Our seismic data show that this unit overlies the URU across much of the Norwegian Channel and has a generally transparent reflection pattern (Figs. 4, 5, 8 and 10\n). The time-thickness of the unit reaches slightly above 120\u00a0ms west of the \u00d8ygarden Fault Zone, is mostly less than 50\u00a0ms across the Norwegian Channel, and pinches out at the western channel margin and beneath the M\u00e5l\u00f8y Plateau (Figs. 5a, 6 and 10, Supplementary Figure 1). The L6 till unit extends northwards to the North Sea Fan, where it correlates with the upper part of P8 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005) and is cut by the headwall of the M\u00f8re Slide (Fig. 5a\u2013c). Together with the overlying unit of marine clay (L5), this till unit is the top seal of the Peon gas discovery at \u223c62\u00b0N (Figs. 1 and 8).\n\n\n4.7.5\nUnit between INC-1 and INC-2\nThe unit between the INC-1 and INC-2 horizons corresponds with unit L5 in core 8903 (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Figure 1). This unit has been interpreted previously as marine clay that was deposited during interglacial conditions (Sejrup et al., 1995). Our seismic data show that the L5 marine clay is thickest close to the \u00d8ygarden Fault Zone (locally more than 200\u00a0ms), thins to zero along the western edge of the Norwegian Channel, and also thins northwards below the M\u00e5l\u00f8y Plateau (Figs. 4, 5 and 8). Internally, low-amplitude reflections parallel to the bounding surfaces indicate a well-stratified layered succession. The internal reflections are discontinuous around core 8903 and even more blurred further south and west (Fig. 4b). This blurriness correlates with the intensity of the striations on the INC-2 surface in the R2 region (Fig. 9 and b). Significant variation in the internal reflection pattern occurs in the thickest eastern part of the unit, where both prograding units and erosional surfaces exist close to the \u00d8ygarden Fault Zone (Fig. 4b). These rapid amplitude shifts close to the coast are interpreted to reflect shifting lithologies with intermittent input of coarser clastic sediments. The L5 marine clay unit extends northwards to the North Sea TMF, but it thins to below seismic resolution or is absent at the north-western termination of the URU (Fig. 5a and c).\n\n\n4.7.6\nUnits between INC-2 and the seafloor\nThe sediment units between INC-2 and the seafloor, which correspond with units L4 to L1 in core 8903 (Sejrup et al., 1995), are mostly less than 300\u00a0ms thick (Figs. 4, 5, 8 and 10). These units have been interpreted previously as tills (L4 and L2) and marine clays (L3 and L1), with the uppermost unit, L1, deposited during the last \u223c15 ka (Sejrup et al., 1995). The L4 till unit, which we divide into two parts (L4a and L4b), is interpreted to have been deposited during the two-stage ice-sheet build-up from western Norway that is recorded by the geomorphological features on the underlying INC-2 horizon (Fig. 9) (Rise et al., 2004). Part of unit L4a may represent a grounding-zone wedge that formed during an initial still-stand or re-advance of the ice margin that occurred west of Nordfjord (Fig. 7a and c) (see Section 4.7.3). The L4 till unit can also be traced to the North Sea TMF, where it correlates with unit P6 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005) and infills the headwall of the M\u00f8re Slide (Fig. 5).\nFluvial sediments are also present within the complex INC-2 to seafloor stratigraphy. A delta, which is at least 4\u00a0km wide, 30\u00a0km long and 150\u00a0m high with forests dipping between 6\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 W, is identified in the upper part of the sediment package immediately west of Nordfjord (Figs. 1 and 8). This feature is interpreted as a glaciofluvial delta that formed ahead of ice that extended from Nordfjord. The top of the delta is located in 220\u2013290\u00a0m water depth but, in contrast to previous interpretations (Sejrup et al., 2004), we do not identify the topsets. Instead, the delta top is cut by a surface that contains E-W-orientated troughs that are up to 30\u00a0m deep and 0.2\u20131\u00a0km wide (Fig. 8). This surface is interpreted to have been formed by a subsequent ice advance, which eroded and removed the delta topsets.\n\n\n\n\n5\nSeismic ties to previously published chronostratigraphic ages\nWe tie our interpreted regional horizons to wells with previously published chronostratigraphic ages. Below we report ties from the Dutch sector and Utsira High to the south (Fig. 10b) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Reinardy et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2018; Eidvin et al., 2020), the Visund and Snorre fields to the west (Fig. 10a) (Eidvin and Rundberg, 2001; De Schepper and Mangerud, 2017; Eidvin et al., 2020), and from core 8903 above the Troll Field to the North Sea TMF to the north (Fig. 5a; Sejrup et al., 1995; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005).\n\n5.1\nTie to the south\nAges of \u223c2.6\u00a0Ma and \u223c1.8\u00a0Ma have been derived from palaeomagnetic and biostratigraphic data for the base of Sequence 5 and the top of Sequence 13, respectively, in the Dutch sector of the southern North Sea (Kuhlmann et al., 2006; Kuhlmann and Wong, 2008). Ottesen et al. (2018) and Lamb et al. (2018) used regional seismic data to trace these surfaces northwards to the central North Sea Basin, where they correlate with the base-Quaternary and slightly below the top of Unit B (Fig. 3). The top of Unit B in this study is therefore placed at \u223c1.7\u00a0Ma (i.e. slightly younger than the top of Sequence 13) (Fig. 10b).\nFurther along the northern tie route, our seismic data show that the age estimates of Ottesen et al. (2018) are consistent with those of Reinardy et al. (2017), who used amino acid and Strontium isotope dating to assign ages to intra-Quaternary reflections in the Utsira High\/Johan Sverdrup region (Figs. 1 and 10b). Although Reinardy et al. (2017) pick the base-Quaternary at a slightly higher level than in other studies (Ottesen et al., 2018; Eidvin et al., 2020; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020), this reflection (R2) is also suggested to be slightly younger, at \u223c2\u00a0Ma compared to \u223c2.6\u00a0Ma. Reflection R3, which corresponds to the top of Clinoform Unit 1 of Ottesen et al. (2018) and sub-horizon C1 of this study, is dated to \u223c1.5\u00a0Ma (Reinardy et al., 2017) (Figs. 3 and 10b). This horizon is the youngest that can be tied to the northern North Sea because the deep marine strait that separated the northern and central\/southern North Sea sub-basins became infilled by subsequent sedimentation (Fig. 2a) (Ottesen et al., 2018). Reflection R4 of Reinardy et al. (2017), which corresponds to the top of Clinoform Unit 3 of Ottesen et al. (2018), is dated to \u223c1.2\u00a0Ma (Figs. 3 and 10b). We perform a tentative jump correlation of this surface to sub-horizon C3 in the northern North Sea. The 10\u201312 prograding slope peak reflections between R3 (1.5\u00a0Ma) and R4 (1.2\u00a0Ma) correspond to a similar number of northwest-prograding clinoforms in the northern North Sea. The rationale behind this tie is that glaciers likely advanced simultaneously to the shelf edge in the two sub-basins.\n\n\n5.2\nSnorre and Visund tie\nA roughly east-west seismic profile links the seismic stratigraphy of the Snorre and Visund fields with the eastern Norwegian Channel beyond Sognefjord (Figs. 1 and 10a). Microfossil and Strontium isotope analyses from cores from these fields suggest that the Basal Pleistocene Unit, which contains some of the oldest Quaternary sediments in the northern North Sea (Fig. 10a), was formed during the Gelasian Stage of the Early Pleistocene, most likely between \u223c2.6 and 1.8\u00a0Ma (Fig. 3) (Eidvin et al., 2020). Because progressively younger prograding units downlap the Basal Pleistocene Unit to the northwest (Figs. 2b and 10a), the top of this unit is diachronous. The C1 sub-horizon above the Snorre Field is located immediately above sediments dated by De Schepper and Mangerud (2017) to be younger than 2.6\u00a0Ma, possibly younger than 1.95\u00a0Ma and older than 1.4\u00a0Ma. This fits well with our suggested age of \u223c1.5\u00a0Ma for the C1 sub-horizon\/top of Clinoform Unit 1 (Ottesen et al., 2018) (Figs. 3 and 10b).\n\n\n5.3\nTroll Field to North Sea TMF tie\nThe sediments that infill the Norwegian Channel above the URU in core 8903 (Fig. 4b) were analysed by Sejrup et al. (1995) using biostratigraphic (foraminifera), geochronological (14C, amino acid, strontium isotopes) and palaeomagnetic data. These data suggest that the lowermost unit, the L6 Fedje till, was formed \u223c1.1\u00a0Ma and that the overlying L5 marine clay was deposited between 1.1 and 0.6\u00a0Ma. By linking the stratigraphy of the Troll Field to the North Sea TMF by a composite south-northwest seismic profile, we suggest that the INC-1 horizon overlying the L6 till correlates with the upper surface of unit P8 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005), which has been assigned to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 10 (\u223c0.34\u20130.37\u00a0Ma) (Figs. 3 and 5a). Unit L4 (L4a and L4b) above INC-2 is also traced to the palaeo-shelf edge, where seismic amplitude maps show that it consists of channelised glacigenic debris-flows which have flowed into the shelf edge incisions created by the M\u00f8re Slide (Fig. 5d). The gravity flows of unit L4 correlate with unit P6 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005), which is suggested to be of MIS 8 age (\u223c0.3\u20130.24\u00a0Ma).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nA regional seismic-stratigraphic framework enabled by 3D seismic data\nThe broad coverage and high resolution of our 3D seismic data enable us to establish a robust framework of relative ages for the sediments of the Quaternary Naust Formation in the northern North Sea (Figs. 2 and 3). We have assigned tentative age estimates to seismic horizons by tying them to existing chronostratigraphic ages, including those from the Utsira High to the south (Reinardy et al., 2017; Ottesen et al., 2018) and the North Sea TMF to the north (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005, 2007) (Figs. 5a and 10, Supplementary Figure 1).\nThere is good consistency between existing age estimates within the lower part of the Quaternary stratigraphy, particularly between the base-Quaternary and horizon C3 along the eastern side of the northern North Sea Basin (Figs. 2 and 10). The base-Quaternary correlates with sediments on the mid-Norwegian margin that record increased volumes of ice-rafted debris from that time (Jansen and Sj\u00f8holm, 1991; Ottesen et al., 2009). A slightly younger age of \u223c2.5\u00a0Ma is suggested for horizon A1, which is the oldest prograding slope horizon mapped in this study (Figs. 2b and 10), because older glacigenic sediments are likely to have existed farther landward but were later eroded during formation of the URU. As detailed in Section 5.1, an age of \u223c1.7\u00a0Ma is assumed for the top of Unit B, based on seismic ties to sediments dated by biostratigraphic and palaeomagnetic data in the Dutch sector of the southern North Sea (Kuhlmann and Wong, 2008; Ottesen et al., 2018), whilst ages of \u223c1.5\u00a0Ma and \u223c1.2\u00a0Ma are suggested for horizons C1 and C3, respectively (Figs. 3 and 10b), based on amino acid and Strontium isotope dating in the Utsira High region of the central\/northern North Sea (Reinardy et al., 2017). The other horizons within units A to C are assigned tentative ages based on the relative thickness of the intervening sediment units (Figs. 2 and 3).\nThe ages of the sediments along the western side of the northern North Sea Basin are less well-constrained. Here rivers crossed the subaerial East Shetland Platform to deliver fluviodeltaic sediments to an east-to northeast-prograding depocenter prior to and during the early Quaternary without a significant change in the depositional pattern (Fig. 4a) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020; Batchelor et al., 2021). The interfingering of eastward- and westward-prograding shelf clinoforms in the deepest, central part of the basin enables correlation of the deep marine part of these fluviodeltaic sediments with units B and C derived from the Norwegian mainland (Fig. 4a). However, the age of the older fluviodeltaic sediments relative to unit A, which is confined to the eastern basin flank, is uncertain.\nIn contrast to the regionally consistent ages that are presented for the lower part of the Quaternary stratigraphy, the correlation of seismic horizons across the northern North Sea reveals a significant difference in the estimated ages of the sediments that infill the Norwegian Channel (Figs. 3 and 5). The potential reasons for these differing age estimates are discussed in the following section.\n\n\n6.2\nThe age of the Norwegian Channel and sediments therein\nAn inconsistency exists in the estimated ages of two sediment units close to the base of the Norwegian Channel \u2013 these are unit L6, which is a till, and unit L5, an overlying layer of marine clay (Sejrup et al., 1995). As described in Section 5.3, these units and their bounding reflections (URU, INC-1 and INC-2) can be correlated from the Troll Field to the North Sea TMF (Fig. 5). Horizon INC-1, which is the upper reflection of unit L6, corresponds to the upper reflection of Unit P8 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005) within the TMF (Fig. 5). Unit P8 is cut by, and hence pre-dates, the M\u00f8re Slide, and has an assumed MIS 10 age (\u223c0.34\u20130.37\u00a0Ma) (Fig. 3). Unit L4 can also be traced to the palaeo-shelf break, where it infills the headwall of the M\u00f8re Slide (Fig. 5). Unit L4 corresponds to unit P6 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2005), which is suggested to be of MIS 8 age (\u223c0.3\u20130.24\u00a0Ma) (Figs. 3 and 5). Although the L5 marine clay cannot be traced confidently to the M\u00f8re Slide headwall, its age is constrained by its stratigraphic position below unit P6\/L4 (Fig. 5). These correlations to the North Sea TMF stratigraphy suggests tentative ages of \u223c0.35\u00a0Ma or slightly older for unit L6, and \u223c0.3\u00a0Ma for L5. This is a significant departure from the ages that have been assigned previously to L6 (1.1\u00a0Ma) and L5 (1.1\u20130.6\u00a0Ma) based on the dating of samples from core 8903 (Sejrup et al., 1995).\nObtaining absolute ages for the glacigenic units of the North Sea TMF (Figs. 2b and 5a) is challenging, and some discussion of their robustness is warranted. The upper part of the North Sea TMF stratigraphy, which dates back to MIS 6 (Unit P4 of Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005), is based on a robust age model from a long core positioned at the flank of the TMF (Lekens, 2001). This core intersects a continuous and well-dated section which can be tied with confidence to the TMF stratigraphy (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2007). Below Unit P4, the dating of the lower North Sea TMF succession is complicated by a scarcity of long cores with good temporal resolution. The age constraints for these sediments are based on long seismic ties along a margin that is heavily dissected by large slides, which introduces significant uncertainties (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005 and references therein). However, a strong indication that the age model provided in Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2007) is also robust below Unit P4 is the observation that the volume of glacigenic debris-flows between P4 and P8 is only about 50% of the volume of such sediments deposited during each of the later MIS 6 and MIS 2 full-glacial periods (Table 1 in Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005). An alternative model, in which no shelf-edge glaciations occurred between 1.1\u00a0Ma and 0.5\u00a0Ma (Sejrup et al., 1995), would have resulted in the significant build-up of contourites on the continental slope above Unit P8, which is not observed within the TMF stratigraphy (e.g. Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Hjelstuen and Grinde, 2016).\nIn addition to the disparate age estimates which arise when the Norwegian Channel sediments are tied to the North Sea TMF, an age of 1.1\u00a0Ma for unit L6 is in conflict with our relative age model for Naust units C and D (Figs. 2 and 10). Most notably, this age seems inconsistent with the considerable amount of sediment that is contained in the interval between the top of unit C3 (age of \u223c1.2\u00a0Ma; Reinardy et al., 2017) and L6. For unit L6 to have an age of 1.1\u00a0Ma, the Norwegian Channel would had have to have been excavated before the deep North Sea Basin was infilled and prior to the associated northerly shift in the focus of sediment deposition to the M\u00f8re Basin that is recorded by the transition from units C and D (Fig. 2a) (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020).\n\nSejrup et al. (1995) assigned ages of 1.1\u00a0Ma and 1.1\u20130.6\u00a0Ma to units L6 and L5 based mainly on the reverse magnetic inclinations shown by some of the samples from the L5 marine clay. These palaeomagnetic data were considered to be reliable because the sediments were assumed to be undisturbed. However, our high-resolution 3D seismic data show significant post-depositional modification of the sediments below the INC-2 (L5\/L4) boundary (Figs. 4b and 9b). Core 8903 is positioned where parallel reflections within L5 become diffuse and where north-south-orientated MSGLs, interpreted to have been produced at the base of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, are observed on the overlying INC-2 horizon (Figs. 4b and 9b). Post-depositional modification of these sediments by ice-stream activity is therefore likely and could explain the reverse magnetic measurements recorded in the samples from core 8903. Indeed, a similar argument has been used to explain three other, younger magnetic reversals within this same core (Sejrup et al., 1995).\nThe correlation of horizons INC-1 and INC-2 to the North Sea TMF (Fig. 5), combined with our relative age model (Fig. 10) and evidence for post-depositional modification of the sediments at the base of the Norwegian Channel (Fig. 9), suggest that the L6 till and L5 marine clay units may be significantly younger than assumed previously (e.g. Sejrup et al., 1995). Based on the correlation of these units with sediments within the North Sea TMF (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005, 2007), we suggest tentative age estimates of \u223c0.35\u00a0Ma for L6 and \u223c0.3\u00a0Ma for L5 (Fig. 3). An important implication of our suggested age model is that it would shift the age of formation of the Norwegian Channel at base URU level to >0.35\u00a0Ma, rather than >1.1\u00a0Ma. Critically, this new model allows adequate time for the North Sea Basin to become infilled, for initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, and for a significant amount of sediment to be deposited in the Norwegian Sea (lower part of unit D; Fig. 2b) prior to the onset of sediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel.\n\n\n6.3\nA new model for the timing of glacial events in the northern North Sea\nWe use our regionally consistent seismic-stratigraphic framework (Figs. 2, 3 and 10) to produce a new model for the hypothesised ages of the key glacial and geological events in the Quaternary evolution of the northern North Sea (Fig. 11\n).\n\n6.3.1\nEarly Quaternary (\u223c2.6\u20130.8\u00a0Ma) infilling of the North Sea Basin\nNaust units A to C record the infilling of the northern North Sea Basin during the early Quaternary by mainly glacigenic sediments derived from Norway (Ottesen et al., 2014, 2018; Batchelor et al., 2017, 2021; L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). The arcuate plan-view geometry of the clinoforms within Unit A (Fig. 2a) and the depositional patterns of glacigenic debris-flows on their surfaces (Fig. 6a and b) show that grounded ice first reached a relatively narrow part of the palaeo-shelf break west-southwest of the Sognefjord palaeo-valley close to the onset of the Quaternary (Fig. 11) (L\u00f8seth et al., 2020). During the deposition of units A and B, a deep-marine strait at \u223c60\u00b0N connected the central and southern North Sea Basin to the North Atlantic Ocean (Ottesen et al., 2018). Our 3D seismic data show that this connection was lost by sub-horizon C1 (Fig. 2a), which was formed \u223c1.5\u00a0Ma based on seismic ties to the Utsira High (Fig. 10b) (Reinardy et al., 2017). After the closing of this deep marine strait, the direction of sediment progradation in the northern North Sea shifted to the M\u00f8re Basin to the northwest (Fig. 2a), whilst the central\/southern North Sea Basin continued to be infilled by sediments derived mainly from the south and east (Ottesen et al., 2018).\nAlthough both the Scandinavian and British-Irish ice sheets had marine-terminating margins in the northern North Sea intermittently during the early Quaternary (Rea et al., 2018), these ice sheets are unlikely to have become confluent until after the central\/southern North Sea Basin became infilled. Prior to the initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, 3D seismic evidence suggests that ice streams from both the Scandinavian and British-Irish ice sheets flowed towards the deepest, central part of the North Sea Basin between \u223c57\u00b0N and 58\u00b0N (Buckley, 2017; Rose et al., 2018; Reinardy et al., 2017), which was the last area of the basin to be infilled (Fig. 11) (Lamb et al., 2018; Ottesen et al., 2018).\n\n\n6.3.2\nInitiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (\u223c0.8\u00a0Ma)\nThe infilling of the North Sea Basin is suggested to have encouraged initiation of the northward-flowing Norwegian Channel Ice Stream by reducing accommodation in the North Sea and enabling confluence of the Scandinavian and British-Irish ice sheets (Batchelor et al., 2017). The base of Unit D corresponds with a northerly shift in the focus of glacial sediment delivery into the M\u00f8re Basin (Fig. 2a), and is located approximately at the base of the North Sea TMF (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005; Ottesen et al., 2018).\nWe suggest that the initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, and hence the original incision of the URU, occurred \u223c0.8\u00a0Ma. This age estimate is based on observations that the Matuyama-Brunhes magnetic reversal (0.78\u00a0Ma) is located close to an URU-equivalent surface along the western side of the northern North Sea (Stoker et al., 1983; Ottesen et al., 2014). An age of \u223c0.8\u00a0Ma for the initial excavation of the Norwegian Channel is also consistent with the seismic-stratigraphic framework presented in this study, including the likely timing of final basin infill in the central\/southern North Sea by \u223c1\u00a0Ma (Ottesen et al., 2018). The Norwegian Channel Ice Stream eroded up to 500\u00a0m of pre-existing sediment from the northern North Sea during successive full-glacial periods (Rise et al., 2008; Ottesen et al., 2016; Baig et al., 2019). In our model (Fig. 11), the early phases of ice-stream activity involved minimal sediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel itself. The eroded sediments were instead deposited in the Norwegian Sea where they comprise the lower part of the North Sea TMF (lower unit D, Fig. 2b).\n\n\n6.3.3\nSediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel (\u223c0.35\u00a0Ma \u2013 present-day)\nOur new age estimates for units L6 and L5 (see Section 6.2) suggest that sediment deposition started to occur within the Norwegian Channel from about or slightly before 0.35\u00a0Ma (Figs. 3 and 11). The shift from predominantly erosion to deposition within the Norwegian Channel could have occurred in response to an increase in water depth caused by the northwards tilting of the margin. Isostatic adjustments, which have long wavelengths but occur quickly (\u223c30\u201340 ka; P\u00e5sse, 1996), can be caused by the removal or deposition of large volumes of ice or sediment. The excavation of the Norwegian Channel resulted in isostatic uplift (Baig et al., 2019), but the process adjusted towards stability after repeated episodes of glacial erosion. Conversely, the delivery of large volumes of sediment to the North Sea TMF led to permanent isostatic subsidence and the tilting of the northern North Sea, including the Norwegian Channel, towards the north. Although the INC-2 horizon presently dips towards the north at an angle of <0.05\u00b0, this results in a deepening of up to 140\u00a0m over a distance of \u223c190\u00a0km (Fig. 5a).\nThe implication is that sediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel took place only after a considerable amount of sediment had already accumulated within the North Sea TMF. This theory fits well with our relative age model (Figs. 3 and 10); it accounts for the difference in estimated ages between the C3 horizon (\u223c1.2\u00a0Ma, Reinardy et al., 2017) and the L6 till (\u223c0.35\u00a0Ma, suggested in this study), as well as the significant volume of sediment that is preserved in the lower part of the North Sea TMF (lower unit D, Fig. 2b).\nThe landforms that are preserved on horizon INC-2 (Fig. 9) enable us to reconstruct the detailed pattern of sediment infill within the Norwegian Channel. An initial stage of focused ice flow from the fjords of western Norway, which formed the grooves and compressional ridges within the grounding zone-wedge-like depositional body outlined by R1 (Fig. 9d), was followed by a later phase of ice-stream flow through the channel, as recorded by the north-south-orientated MSGLs of R2 (Fig. 9b). These events, which are interpreted to have taken place after \u223c0.3\u00a0Ma, document dynamic ice-stream behaviour during growth of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during a mid-Pleistocene glacial period. The switch from a westerly to a northerly ice-stream flow direction in the Norwegian Channel was probably related to the southerly expansion of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and its ice divide during the build-up to full-glacial conditions. A similar, two-stage pattern of ice-stream flow in the northern North Sea is likely to have occurred during other mid-to late-Pleistocene glacial periods. The thick (up to 1\u00a0km) succession of sediments that is preserved above the M\u00f8re Slide in the North Sea TMF (Fig. 2) records the efficient delivery of sediments by the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream to the palaeo-shelf break during the last \u223c0.35\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11) (King et al., 1996; Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2005, 2007; Hjelstuen and Grinde, 2016; Bellwald et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n6.4\nImplications\n\n6.4.1\nGlacial history\nReconstructions of the glacial history of the North Sea and its surrounding land masses (e.g. Mangerud et al., 1996, 2011; Riis, 1996; Sejrup et al., 2005; Stoker et al., 2005; Batchelor et al., 2019; Pedersen et al., 2021) have attached significant weight to the age of \u223c1.1\u00a0Ma that has been assigned to the layer of till (L6) at the base of the Norwegian Channel (Sejrup et al., 1995) (Fig. 4b). The importance of this date for reconstructing past ice sheets is amplified by the dearth of age estimates available for the Quaternary sediments of the North Sea. Glaciation curves based on ages derived from core 8903 suggest that the deposition of this till by the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream \u223c1.1\u00a0Ma was followed by a 0.6\u00a0Ma period of restricted ice sheets that spanned much of the mid-Pleistocene (Sejrup et al., 1995, 2000, 2005; Mangerud et al., 2011).\nWe suggest, based on seismic ties (Figs. 5 and 10, Supplementary Figure 1) and evidence for sediment reworking at the base of the Norwegian Channel (Figs. 4b and 9), that the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream initiated \u223c0.8\u00a0Ma and that the Fedje Till (L6) was deposited at the base of the channel about or prior to 0.35\u00a0Ma. In our new model, the glacigenic sediments that are preserved in the lower part of the North Sea TMF (lower unit D) were deposited during multiple phases of shelf-break glaciation that occurred throughout the mid-Pleistocene, including in the interval \u223c1.1\u20130.5\u00a0Ma that has been assumed previously to have been ice-free (Fig. 11). Our interpretation of extensive grounded ice in the northern North Sea during this period is in agreement with evidence for shelf-break glaciation beyond the mid-Norwegian and western Barents Sea margins during the early mid-Pleistocene (Knies et al., 2009; Montelli et al., 2017). There is also evidence for an expanded southern margin of the European Ice Sheet during this time (e.g. MIS 16, \u223c0.75\u00a0Ma) (Hughes and Gibbard, 2018). Our new hypothesised ages for the formation and infilling of the Norwegian Channel therefore remove the need for an anomalous, extended ice-free interval in the North Sea during the early mid-Pleistocene, which was a period of global climate deterioration and ice-sheet growth (e.g. Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005).\n\n\n6.4.2\nHydrocarbons systems\nWhereas previous reconstructions of Quaternary subsidence and uplift have considered the Naust Formation as a single sediment unit (Goff, 1983; Kubala et al., 2003; Lothe et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2019), our new seismic-stratigraphic framework and hypothesised ages (Figs. 2, 3 and 10) allow for higher-resolution subsidence and uplift curves to be constructed for exploration wells in the northern North Sea. Reliable subsidence curves for Quaternary sediments are needed to investigate wide-ranging geological processes, including the build-up of fluid overpressure, compaction, maturation of source rocks, generation and migration of hydrocarbons, and shifts in migration routes (Osborne and Swarbrick, 1997; Bj\u00f8rlykke, 1999, 2010; Dewhurst et al., 1998; Chapman, 2000). These processes are relevant given that the sediments of the Naust Formation host several gas discoveries, contain injected and extrusive sands (L\u00f8seth et al., 2012), and are the seal for CO2 sequestration in the underlying Utsira Formation (Halland et al., 2014; Lloyd et al., 2021).\nOne of the key implications of our hypothesised younger ages for the formation and infilling of the Norwegian Channel is that the Peon sand at \u223c62\u00b0N (Figs. 1 and 8), which is interpreted as a glaciofluvial outwash fan (Ottesen et al., 2012; Mikalsen, 2015), may have been formed more recently than assumed previously (>0.35\u00a0Ma, rather than >1.1\u00a0Ma). This is based on seismic ties from the Troll Field and the North Sea TMF to the Peon discovery, which show that the age of the Peon sand post-dates the formation of the URU and pre-dates the formation of horizon INC-1 (Figs. 4, 5 and 8). Another implication is that the westward tilting of the Troll Field at \u223c60\u00b030\u02caN (Fig. 1) may have also occurred significantly later than inferred previously (Riis, 1996; Horstad and Larter, 1997; Medvedev et al., 2019). Because most of the westward tilting of the palaeo-oil-water-contact in the Troll Field was completed prior to the infilling of the Norwegian Channel, our new age estimates could shift the timing of this event from >1.1\u00a0Ma to >0.35\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe used large cubes of high-resolution 3D seismic broadband data to reveal the architecture and evolution of the Quaternary Naust Formation sediments that infill the northern North Sea Basin (Figs. 1 and 2). A seismic amplitude map extracted from a surface that cuts the prograding slope clinoforms shows the infill pattern as a series of \u201cstratigraphic growth rings\u201d that document the shifting focus of predominantly glacial sedimentation from close to the mouth of Sognefjord to the M\u00f8re Basin (Fig. 2). These data enable us to interpret more than 20 intra-Naust surfaces across the northern North Sea, establish a seismic-stratigraphic framework of their relative age, and assess the correspondence between existing absolute age estimates (Figs. 3, 5a and 10). Although there is good consistency between age estimates within the lower part of the Quaternary stratigraphy, there is a major difference in the suggested age of the sediments at the base of the Norwegian Channel between core 8903 in the Troll Field and the North Sea TMF (Figs. 4 and 5). Together with evidence for significant sediment disturbance by ice-stream activity towards the base of core 8903 (Fig. 9), this leads us to suggest a new model for the age of these sediments, in which sediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel may have occurred as recently as \u223c0.35\u00a0Ma in response to prior sediment loading and subsidence within the North Sea TMF (Fig. 11). This scenario allows adequate time for the North Sea Basin to become infilled, for initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, and for a significant amount of sediment to be deposited within the lower North Sea TMF prior to the onset of sediment deposition within the Norwegian Channel. Our new model fits well with age estimates derived from the Utsira High\/Johan Sverdrup region to the south and with our current understanding of the glacial history of the Scandinavian and British-Irish ice sheets. The development of a regionally consistent seismic-stratigraphic framework constrained by robust ages is important to construct reliable subsidence and uplift curves to investigate wide-ranging geological processes in the North Sea, including the build-up of fluid overpressure, compaction and maturation of source rocks, and generation and migration of hydrocarbons.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nHL devised the project, interpreted the seismic data and wrote a first draft of the paper.

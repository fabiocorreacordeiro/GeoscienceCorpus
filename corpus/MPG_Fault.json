Herein, we use a high resolution dataset by separating the Pannonian (= Tortonian) stack into 20 lithostratigraphic units, which allow calculating regional differences in sedimentation rates over a time span of \u223c1.6\u00a0Ma. During this time span we recognize an initial phase of high lateral variability in thicknesses, reflecting the influence of paleo-topography on deposition during the early Pannonian. The relief difference of about 300\u00a0m was rapidly filled by lake marls and delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube. Subsequently, lateral variability in sediment thicknesses declined strongly around 11.0\u00a0Ma. At that point the relief was largely sealed, and subsidence became the controlling factor. Our data document a shift of high subsidence rates from the southern VB to the northern VB into three steps, initiated by increased activity of the Steinberg Fault around 10.5\u201310.4\u00a0Ma. Sedimentation rates have been declining during the early Pannonian but reveal a strong pulse in subsidence during the middle Pannonian. The still high sedimentation rates during the late Pannonian indicate persisting extensional tectonics in the VB throughout the Late Miocene and question the prevailing tectonic model of a compressional regime for this time. The lack of uppermost Pannonian deposits in most wells documents a post-Pannonian erosion of about 400\u00a0m in large parts of the VB.\n               ","1":"\n                  The mechanism of large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation in the Tethys domain has long been of interest to petroleum geologists. Located in the northern margin of the Tethys, the Amu Darya Basin (ADB) is well known for its large, indeed giant, gas fields. However, there has been surprisingly little research on the mechanisms of hydrocarbon accumulation in the basin. This paper investigates the accumulation history of the Samandepe Gas Field, a large condensate gas field in the Chardzhou step-fault zone in the northeastern ADB. Trap evolution in the basin is analyzed, the oil and gas sources and hydrocarbon charging periods are determined, and the process of hydrocarbon migration and accumulation explored to establish the relationship between hydrocarbon accumulation and the tectonic evolution of the Tethys. Geophysical logging, organic geochemistry, fluid inclusion analysis, basin modeling are used for analysis. The results show that hydrocarbon accumulation in the Samandepe Gas Field occurred in two stages. First, a lithological \u2018large trap\u2019 formed in a barrier reef belt in the Late Cretaceous Santonian, before the present anticline structure of the gas field formed. This trap was filled with oil generated in Upper Jurassic marine source rocks, forming a lithological paleo-oil reservoir. In the second stage, at the end of the Paleogene, the large trap was reformed as structural traps with reef-shoal reservoirs. Natural gas generated from coal-measure source rocks in Middle and Lower Jurassic strata migrated along basement faults, filling the traps. Excess natural gas displaced the oil, some of which dissolved in the gas, forming \u2018gas washing\u2019-type secondary condensate oil and creating a structural condensate oil-bearing field. The inherited paleo-uplift in the step-fault zone is crucial to large-scale hydrocarbon accumulation in the ADB.\n               ","2":"\n                  The Ordovician carbonate fault-controlled reservoir in the Shunnan area is substantially different from the typical karst reservoir closely related to an unconformity. The development of fault-controlled reservoirs is controlled by the deep and large strike-slip fault in the Middle Caledonian period. The characteristics, diagenesis types, diagenetic fluid evolution characteristics, fluid-rock interactions, and reservoir response of fault-controlled reservoirs were investigated systematically by analyzing 3D seismic, logging, and drilling core data. Production data, reservoir petrology, and chemical filling geochemistry were also used. The formation and evolution of fault-controlled reservoirs are affected by the coupling of the structure, lithofacies, and fluid. The dolomitization in the quasi-syngenetic period in the early stage of Episode I in the Middle Caledonian provided the material basis for the development of fault-controlled reservoirs. The Mg-rich high-salinity thermal fluid in the late Caledonian and the Early Hercynian provided a constructive transformation for the development of fault-controlled reservoirs. In contrast, the transformation of reservoirs by the Si-rich magmatic thermal fluid in the late Hercynian was mainly destructive, and the action range of the deep thermal fluid was strongly controlled by strike-slip fault zones. The releasing bend and superimposed parts of different structural styles in the fault zone have high activity intensity. These are areas where dissolution and transformation of the fluid occur preferentially. Dolomite is often more conducive to the development of fault fracture zones and promotes the dissolution and transformation of the deep thermal fluid. Therefore, the strike-slip fault cutting through the basement causes the hydrothermal fluid to enter the fault, dissolving carbonate minerals and forming a hydrothermal-modified fault-controlled reservoir composed of fractures, dissolution pores, and dolomite intercrystalline pores. The results provide a new approach and direction for the study of different types of deep and ultra-deep carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","3":"\n                  Identifying the timing, geometry, mechanism and multiphase reactivation of the inherited structures on the structural style of the fold-and-thrust belt is important for hydrocarbon exploration and production.\n                  In this work, we present a multidisciplinary approach including field data, seismic profiles, well data analyses, isopach maps, 2D balanced cross-sections construction, and 2D sequential restoration. Such an approach is applied to decipher the multiphase deformation of the NNE-SSW trending deep-seated Kharg-Mish Fault (KMF) that controlled the tectono-sedimentary evolution and structural style of the Gachsaran Anticline (South Dezful Embayment - SDE). Kinematic analysis of the KMF reveals two different mechanisms from normal to reverse faulting (positive inversion) since the Cenomanian. From the Late Cretaceous-Late Miocene, the sedimentary cover thickness \u223c2500\u00a0m decreases along-strike of the Gachsaran Anticline towards the east, over the KMF, due to regional erosion and pinch-out.\n                  The eastern sector of the Gachsaran Anticline shows an angular and smaller wavelength fold in the levels of Asmari and Sarvak formations due to the efficient local middle d\u00e9collements of the Kazhdumi and Pabdeh formations. Different amounts of shortening, 19.4% for the western and 16.7% for the eastern sector, and fore-thrust propagation developed a tear fault that accommodated differential deformation. Long-term structural evolution and strain localization in the eastern sector of the Gachsaran Anticline over the KMF produced dense fracturing. Our study suggests that mechanism and timing of deformation along the pre-existing basement structures are important in structural evolution of the sedimentary cover, oil migration and accumulation in such a hydrocarbon province.\n               ","4":"\n                  The northern South China Sea (SCS) continental margin has a very complex geological history within a multiplate convergent setting and has experienced multiphase tectonic movements, during which the largest significant petroliferous basin, the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB), developed. Along the northern boundary of the PRMB, a prominent wide ENE-striking intraplate deformation zone, the Littoral Fault Zone (LFZ), stretches from west to east and is considered to be the major fault structure that formed during the spreading of the SCS and rifting of the northern continental margin. However, a lack of direct constraints on stratigraphic records and fault intersections due to difficulties with offshore geophysical exploration has resulted in uncertainty about the nature of the LFZ, especially the location, geometry and deep\u2013shallow structural coupling, which are still unclear. In this paper, we use newly collected enhanced images provided by 2D long-offset multichannel seismic reflection profiles across the LFZ Pearl River Mouth (PRM) segment to analyse the deep structural and stratigraphic elements along the LFZ. Combining these data with previous findings, we attempt to advance the understanding of the NE\u2013ENE-striking LFZ nature, evolutionary history and controlling effect on the tectonic and sedimentary processes that led to the formation of the PRMB. The results of this work shed new light on the geodynamic processes surrounding the PRMB. We suggest that the LFZ acted as a northern boundary fault with a three-phase transition over time. The first phase of fault activity initiated as a low-angle basement decollement (phase 1), followed by high-angle SE-dipping normal faults, which were mostly inherited from basement faults and reactivated during the Zhuqiong movement (phase 2). Above these two structures, the faults are characterized by strike-slip faulting, which occurred in the Oligocene (phase 3). The overall geometry of the LFZ shows right-step dextral features in the PRM segment that are obviously segmented by NW\u2013WNW-trending faults. Our results highlight the significant role of this ENE-striking fault system in the basin sub-basin (sag) formation on the northern continental margin of the SCS.\n               ","5":"\n                  Several giant oilfileds have been discovered during recent exploration in the Ordovician carbonates in zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions, Tarim Basin, China. These oilfields are deeply buried (>7000\u00a0m), and most productive wells are found adjacent to fault zones, suggesting faults may play a crucial role in reservoir development. Here, we use petrographic, microanalytical and geochemical techniques on different stages of void-filling calcite cements to decipher the tectonic-fluid evolution history. Vugs are generally occluded by V1 and V2 calcite cements, which precipitated from marine and burial diagenetic fluids. Two major episodes of fluid invasion are evident in each set of fractures from Middle Ordovician strike-slip faults (F1) to Late Devonian to the Permian strike-slip faults (F2). The sub-horizontal fracture-filling F1 calcite cements show the involvement of near-surface marine to marine-evolved brines, given that \u03b418Ocarb, restored \u03b418Ow values and rare earth element and yttrium (REY) profiles of F1-1 calcite cements are comparable to Ordovician seawater. The F1-2 calcite cements are characterized by negative \u03b418Ocarb, positive restored \u03b418Ow, and apparent Ce positive anomalies. The sub-vertical fracture-filling ferroan F2-1 calcite cements with fluorescence show the highest restored T(\u039447) (up to 125\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (up to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW), and an enrichment in MREE, which is consistent with an origin from hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal brines. The subsequent F2-2 calcite cements may have precipitated during the Late Permian from mixing of basinal brines and deeply circulated meteoric water, as suggested by significantly negative \u03b418Ocarb values, cooler restored T(\u039447), negative restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), and flat REY patterns. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of calcite cements are similar to coeval seawater. This study highlights the importance of fault-related fluid circulation in the development of a hydrocarbon reservoir, and may be applicable to other deep carbonate-hosted reservoirs.\n               ","6":"\n                  The present paper investigates the oil migration and lineament distribution in fault zones within a sedimentary basin, showcasing the results from an integrated use of geochemical, and remote sensing data along the Fazenda Bel\u00e9m Fault Zone (FBFZ) in the Potiguar Basin, Brazilian Equatorial Margin. Lineaments were detected from a LiDAR digital elevation model data set using the quantitative method of morphology recognition based on horizontal and vertical curvature calculation and mapping. The polynomial regression-based spatial distribution of 20S\/(20S\u00a0+\u00a020R) C29 steranes is successfully used in oils from offshore and onshore reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin, tracing field-scale oil migration direction. These multidisciplinary analyses revealed that the oil initially migrated from an offshore area along the NE-oriented fault zone, and then parts moved along the branches of this zone to finally reach the areas of the onshore reservoirs. In addition, NE-oriented lineaments enhanced the near-surface fluid circulation, while they commonly correspond to the topographic features and fault zones. Anisotropy tensors and slip- and dilation tendency calculated from the lineament map also indicate that the geometric complexity of the lineament pattern is influenced by present-day and partitioned stress fields in the Potiguar Basin. The integration of remote-sensing and geochemistry analyses at the FBFZ area proved to be effective in approaching the tectonic aspects of a fault zone in a petroleum basin, as well as in investigating the field-scale migration of oil along the fracture corridor in a fault zone.\n               ","7":"\n                  This work reconstructs the evolution of a source-to-sink system in a transpressional setting from compositional changes within its deep-water clastic offshoots. Field-based clast counts on 10 conglomerate beds of three transects, combined with petrographical and mineralogical (XRD) analyses on 14 samples, have been used to integrate the already-existing large dataset developed during more than 60 years of study on the Como Conglomerate (the base of the Gonfolite Lombarda Group, Chattian to Aquitanian \u2013 Northern Italy). The results shed a new light on the terranes involved in the production of sediments and further constrain the evolution of the fluvial drainage in response to the Cenozoic Adria indentation during the post-collisional phases of Alpine orogeny. In particular, it has been possible to track-back the steps during which paleorivers were connected, and later disconnected, with the basin due to the Oligo-Miocene activity of the right-lateral Periadriatic Fault System (PFS). During its transpressive movement, accommodating the Adria westward indentation, the PFS cumulated a total displacement increasing from ca. 20\u00a0km to the west, up to ca. 60\u00a0km, to the east. The results of this study also constrain the post-depositional kinematics of the clastic wedge, which was progressively rotated clockwise and thrust to its present-day position, onto the Southalpine Mesozoic sequence. This model represents a fundamental step forward in the comprehension of how tectonic indentation interacts with surface source-to-sink systems, and demonstrates that tectonic induced connections\/disconnections of fluvial systems are as fundamental as exhumation processes in the transfer of sediments from source to sink areas.\n               ","8":"\n                  The Middle Jurassic limestones of the Vajont Formation, which constitute major parts of the flanks of the Vajont Canyon (Southern Alps, Italy), have been subjected to pervasive dolomitization. The dolomites are localized within fault damage zones. Based on field and petrographic characteristics, two dolostone groups can be differentiated. Group 1, being the most prevailing, corresponds to replacive matrix dolostones. They form non-stratabound plume-like geobodies. They also occur as infill in infrequent veins in the host limestones that occur adjacent to these replacive plume-like dolostone bodies. Group 2, that is less common, consists of saddle dolomite cements. It occurs in breccia and veins or makes up zebra dolostones. The latter cements frequently affect the replacive group 1 dolostones. Fluid inclusion analyses of both dolostone groups indicate comparable salinity values of 1.2\u20135.3 eq. wt.% NaCl with homogenization temperatures of 70\u2013108\u00a0\u00b0C, which in addition of overlapping 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.70811\u20130.70846) reflect similar parental fluids. The estimated salinities, in combination with \u03b418O values (\u22125.5 to \u221214.8\u2030 V-PDB), indicate significant contributions of 18O-depleted fluids postulated to be modified meteoric waters. This origin is supported by the low trace element contents measured in the studied dolostones. These data support that the fault-controlled dolostones in the studied Vajont area precipitated from hot hypo- to mesohaline fluids. These fluids could have circulated along inherited Mesozoic syn-rift fault and fracture corridors. However, another possibility is that fluids circulated along fault and fracture systems that developed during the Neo-Alpine Orogeny (Miocene). Both could have served as efficient deep-seated fluid migration conduits as well as relatively shallow ones facilitating the downward flow of topography-driven meteoric waters.\n               ","9":"\n                  This article presents an overview of regional extensional deformation across the north-facing southern Tethyan continental passive margin of Tunisia during the Aptian and Albian syn-rift stages. Because of the Late Eocene, Late Miocene and Pleistocene orogenic overprinting, the earlier extensional history of the Tunisian Atlassic province had to be reconstructed from balanced and sequentially restored transects across four key fault systems active at the time. These were used to (i) estimate the amount and timing of extension and (ii) calculate the expansion index (EI) for each fault system. The analysis demonstrates the region experienced a very significant amount of mid-Cretaceous extension, representing the last of several Permian-Mesozoic rift events. Two closely linked styles of deformation were recognised: thick-skinned basement involved faulting and shallow listric faulting detached on decollement surfaces within late Triassic evaporites. Both styles of faulting triggered salt diapirism.\n                  Sequential pre-orogenic restorations of a transect across the Tebaga Kebili and Orbata faults in the southern part of this province suggest both experienced a large amount of extensional displacement during the Aptian and Albian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a02.6\u00a0km), recorded by footwall erosion, growth strata, rollover structures and changes in sedimentary facies. A similar restoration across the Labaiedh (M'rhila-Cherichira) fault system further north, identified both thick and thin-skinned extensional movement associated with diapiric growth and salt extrusion reaching a maximum during the Aptian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a00.55\u00a0km). A pre-Tertiary restoration of the Teboursouk fault system in the northern part of the province, demonstrated thick-skinned extension peaking during the Albian (Aptian-Albian extension\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0km). This accommodated a thick sequence of basinal shales to the north, deformed by active diapirism with sea-floor salt extrusion, triggered by deep basement faulting and enhanced by the plastic incompetent character of the thick shale dominant overburden.\n                  Regional extension across the Tunisian Atlassic province during the Aptian-Albian was contemporaneous with a significant change in intra-plate stress across northern Africa, the opening of the South Atlantic and structural reorganization along the East African continental margin. This synchroneity across such a wide region may reflect some still poorly understood deep crustal processes, ultimately responsible for reactivating older rift faults and regional tilting across the province. The associated gravity salt gliding and diapirism bear comparison with the post-rift deformational style of the South Atlantic passive margin. However intra-evaporite decollement surfaces were more local, limited by active thick-skinned faulting with diapirism typically soft linked to deeper fault movement.\n               ","10":"\n                  The Sin\u00fa Fold Belt, located in the southwestern part of the South Caribbean Deformed Belt, northwest Colombia, has been interpreted as the outer portion of an accretionary wedge resulting from the subduction of the Caribbean Plate under the South American Plate. Several geological sections, across and along the offshore portion of the Sin\u00fa Fold Belt, have been constructed through geological interpretation of 2D seismic sections constrained by a few exploration wells. Their analysis has allowed us to quantify the amount of horizontal motion (shortening responsible for the structures and basal detachment displacement) and vertical motion (tectonic subsidence\/uplift and wedge vertical thickening) undergone by the belt over time; unravel its recent evolution consisting of almost no active structures in the south edge and a large amount of active structures northwards; quantify its pore pressure, coefficient of friction and strength using its wedge geometry consisting of high taper angles in the lower continental slope near the deformation front and lower taper angles in the upper continental slope away from it; and understand the aseismic and trench-lacking character of the belt. These observations have been crucial to identify the main features of the morphostructural zones across the belt (Colombian Basin, lower continental slope, upper continental slope and continental shelf) and establish a new along-strike zoning (north region influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp, Sin\u00fa Fold Belt s.s., and south salient influenced by the Uramita Fault).\n               ","11":"\n                  Provenance identification and evolving process restoration for submarine sedimentary systems are crucial for understanding the deposition process of gravity flows and for future evaluations of oil and gas reservoirs. This paper targets a newly discovered late Miocene multibranch submarine channel developed in the Ledong gas field, eastern margin of the Yinggehai Basin, South China Sea. The natural gas sweet spot, Ledong block, located in the intersection area of the channel's three branches, was systematically studied via zircon U\u2013Pb dating, heavy minerals, seismic and well logging approaches, and structure analysis to obtain information about the characteristics of provenance and the process of sedimentation. Detrital zircon U\u2013Pb age distribution and heavy mineral assemblage results indicate that the channel shares similar geochronological signatures of sediment from the rivers in western Hainan Island. The seismic interpretation suggests that the East Branch bifurcates at the intersection area, meeting the North Branch in the northwest and extending southeast to form the South Branch. Active fault movement during the early Miocene provides negative topography for the formation of the gravity flow channel, while the later sea level fall facilitates the transport and deposition of the river sediments. This study finally reconstructs a time series-based sedimentary model to better illustrate the channel evolution process. The development of channel reservoirs in the southeast Yinggehai Basin could be mainly constrained by the fault's activation as well as the Hainan sediment supply. The findings reveal the major provenance constraints for the evolution of a multibranch submarine channel system across the Ledong gas field and are of great significance for future natural gas resource exploration.\n               ","12":"\n                  Seismic resolution and illumination issues are sources of challenges in the detailed imaging and detection of subsurface fault architecture and fluid migration. Improved constraints on resolution can provide input into monitoring requirements and detectability of CO2 leakage, and fault-sealing properties during subsurface visualization of migration pathways. This study explores detection and resolution thresholds via synthetic seismic imaging of a detailed shallow normal fault model with realistic fault architecture including sub-seismic structures of damage zones. The base fault model is built from interpretations of high-resolution P-Cable seismic data and is further developed and conditioned by outcrop-based observations and empirical laws for fracture and deformation band distribution. Damage zones of sandstone layers host deformation bands contrary to shale layers with fractures, while mixed lithologies (shaley sandstone and sandy shale) are subjected to a combination of the two deformation mechanisms. We utilize a 2D point-spread function based convolution seismic modelling to produce the synthetic seismic images. Test scenarios include one baseline fault model without a damage zone (M1), and five more advanced\/detailed fault models incorporating features known from outcrops (M2-M6; damage zones, an isolated fracture corridor, and gas seeps (CO2) along damage zones of faults and in the fracture corridor). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on two selected models test the effect of changing the illumination angle and wavelet. The results show that: (1) faults with damage zones have larger disturbances in seismic signals than faults without damage zones, (2) stronger amplitudes are distinguished for models with CO2-filled fractures, (3) a fracture corridor (5\u00a0m at it widest) is clearly visible where it crosses horizons bounding horizontal layers, (4) sensitivity tests show good imaging for illumination \u226545\u00b0, which is the average dip of the main fault segment, and (5) learnings from fault modelling offer guidance for seismic monitoring.\n               ","13":"\n                  The Sohar Basin, located offshore the East Coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is an area that has seldom been the focus of international oil companies. While all commercial discoveries in the UAE and Oman have been made to the west and south of the Oman Mountains, the Sohar Basin is underexplored and remains prospective. This lack of activity is primarily because the Thamama reservoir, which has yielded huge success to the west of the Oman Mountains is likely not present within the Sohar Basin. However, potential traps, reservoirs, and source rocks are present within the Tertiary succession. The Sohar Basin formed in the late Cretaceous after the obduction of the Semail Ophiolite onto the Arabian Plate. Following a period of tectonic quiescence, which lasted until the Early Eocene, the gravitational collapse occurred along the eastern edge of the present-day Oman Mountains.\n                  Interpretation of both 2D and 3D seismic reveals that the subsurface is comprised of three tectonostratigraphic units, defined as pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic packages. North-South trending thrust faults generate distinct mini-basins within the pre- and syn-tectonic sequences. The post-tectonic sequence is defined by the development of prograding systems in a tectonically quiescent margin formed in the Lower Miocene and which persists to the present day. Deep-water depositional systems dominate the undrilled far-east and south of the basin where the presence of submarine canyon systems and associated basin floor fans is supported by 3D seismic data. In recent times, the Sohar Basin has been subject to extensional faulting likely driven by sediment load caused by a prograding delta system.\n                  The results of this work reveal that multiple untested play types exist within the Sohar Basin, which are comprised of both structural and stratigraphic elements. This paper integrates both a structural and sequence stratigraphic interpretation to provide insights into the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Sohar Basin. Consequently, the fundamentals of play fairway mapping have been employed to unlock the hydrocarbon prospectivity offshore the UAE's East Coast.\n               ","14":"\n                  The surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is among the most important geological events in Earth's history, but the growth of the eastern TP margin that yielded the thickened crust and abrupt topography remains controversial. In this paper, six sample apatite fission-track (AFT) analyses of three boreholes in the Xiji Basin are applied to constrain the Mesozoic-Cenozoic uplift and exhumation history of the eastern Qilian Shan, northeastern TP. Most of the AFT ages range from 134\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0Ma to 117\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0Ma, except for the shallowest sample, with a younger age of 65.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0Ma. Thermal history modeling indicates that the eastern Qilian Shan experienced a three-phase differential cooling history: (1) widespread rapid cooling during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (ca. 174-120\u00a0Ma, Stage 1), (2) regional cooling during the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene (ca. 80-60\u00a0Ma, Stage 2) and (3) widespread cooling during the Eocene-early Miocene (ca. 40-20\u00a0Ma, Stage 3). We conclude that the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous was the main stage of the growth and thickening of the northeastern TP, which was related to the upper-crustal horizontal shortening of the eastern Qilian Shan. Thermal history modeling of the youngest sample and seismic profile analysis imply significant reactivation of the Liupanshan fault zone during ca. 80-60\u00a0Ma. This locally intense uplift and deformation on the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan during the Late Cretaceous was likely induced by the closure of the Neo-Tethys and the continued shortening of the Lhasa-Qiangtang block. Late Eocene-Early Miocene (ca. 40-20\u00a0Ma) cooling of the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan records the coeval crustal extension and exhumation of the northeastern margin of the TP as the far-field effect of subduction of the western Pacific plate. Our AFT data detect no intense late Cenozoic reactivation information for the Xiji region, which indicates that the ca. 15-7\u00a0Ma rapid uplift triggered by fault reactivation was only located in the Haiyuan-Liupanshan fault zone, along the eastern margin of the Qilian Shan, northeastern TP. This multi-phase exhumation history is not beneficial for regional hydrocarbon exploration.\n               ","15":"\n                  High-quality 3D seismic reflection and well data are used to investigate the distribution, evolution history and significance of tectonic faulting in a salt minibasin offshore Esp\u00edrito Santo, SE Brazil. Displacement-length (Dmax-L) plots, displacement-depth (D-Z) plots and structural maps are compiled to understand the growth history of distinct fault families. Interpreted structures include crestal, corridor, listric and keystone faults. Their geometry, orientation and relative distribution reveal important differences. In detail, listric faults were formed in the investigated salt withdrawal basin following a NW to WNW strike, and show multiple bright spots and pockmarks around them. The strata into which listric faults sole out have similar seismic, lithological and petrophysical characters to known Cenomanian to Turonian source rocks, which comprise shales and marls with high gamma-ray values. Low-amplitude to transparent seismic facies further indicate the presence of ductile, highly likely organic-rich shales and marls. As a result, three evolutionary stages can be identified: a) Stage 1 is characterised by the formation of NW- or WNW-striking listric faults, keystone faults and the onset of reactive diapirism; b) Stages 2 and 3 record active diapirism due to a relative increase in sediment loading, documenting the formation of many crestal, corridor and keystone faults. Importantly, normalised leakage factor analyses reveal keystone faults to be the most favourable pathways to fluid migrating in the investigated salt minibasin. Conversely, listric faults are likely to form barriers and baffles to fluid in their lower parts.\n               ","16":"\n                  In rift basins, normal faults conducting and sealing fluids are the main mechanisms for evaluating fault-related reservoirs, and the defined threshold value of fault conduction or sealing is based on statistics. However, fault transmissibility characteristics under a transition condition of fault conduction and sealing have not been clarified. This study used structural deformation and hydrocarbon charging as a foundation to quantitatively characterize fault transmissibility under the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing. This study examined faults occurring in sandstone\u2013mudstone interbeds and used the fault throw and mudstone content as the main variables. The physical simulation results revealed that despite all models exhibiting simple \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture with only a fault core, their internal composition undergoes a sequential change from the mudstone drag, mudstone drag and sliding surface to the mudstone breccia and sliding surface. Similarly, when the fault is in the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing under the constraints of mudstone, a normal distribution is observed in terms of the number of oil-bearing layers, oil-bearing length, and oil-bearing area of the lateral fault conduction. However, when the shale smear factor (SSF) is too high, the \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture mainly comprises the mudstone breccia and sliding surface, which increases the vertical fault transmission and reduces the lateral fault conduction. Conversely, an excessively small SSF, where the fault zone is a \u201cone-layer\u201d fault architecture comprising mainly the mudstone drag or mudstone drag and sliding surface, will restrict the vertical fault transmission and reduce the lateral fault conduction. When the lateral fault conduction near the inflection point of the normal distribution reaches its threshold, the superposition of mudstone along the fault and the presence of mudstone breccia in the fault zone become critical for decelerating the vertical fault transmission and accelerating the lateral fault conduction. The study of normal fault transmissibility characteristics under the transition condition of fault conduction and sealing provides a solid theoretical foundation for the risk assessment of fault-related hydrocarbon accumulation.\n               ","17":"\n                  This study integrates field structural data, petrographic and geochemical (\u03b418O, \u03b413C, \u039447, 87Sr\/86Sr, and elemental composition) analyses and U\u2013Pb dating of calcite veins cutting the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Southern Pyrenees) in order to date and to investigate the spatio-temporal relationships between fluid flow and fold evolution. This E-W trending anticline grew from Late Cretaceous to Paleocene at the front of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet deforming pre-growth and growth sedimentary sequences. U\u2013Pb dating reveals Late Cretaceous to late Miocene deformation ages, which agree with the age of growth strata deposition and the sequence of deformation interpreted from field and microstructural data.

Other ages (20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma) postdate the folding event and have been associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The geochemistry of calcite veins indicates that the fluid flow behavior varied across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline through its growth, showing a compartmentalized fluid system. In the hinge of the anticline and in the upper Santonian to middle Campanian syn-orogenic sequence along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the similar petrographic and geochemical features between all calcite cements and host rocks point towards a locally-derived or well-equilibrated fluid system. Contrarily, along large faults such as the B\u00f3ixols thrust, and in the anticline limbs, the geochemistry of vein cements indicates a different scenario. Cements in large faults yielded the lightest \u03b418O values, from \u22128 to \u221214 \u2030VPDB, and variable enrichment in \u03b413C, 87Sr\/86Sr, elemental composition and \u03b418Ofluid. This is interpreted as the migration of fluids, through fault zones, that evolved from distinct fluid origins. Cements in the fold limbs exhibit \u03b418O and \u03b413C between \u22128 and \u22126 \u2030VPDB and between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02 \u2030VPDB, respectively, the lowest Sr contents and the lowest precipitation temperatures, suggesting that the anticline limbs recorded the infiltration and evolution of meteoric waters. The paleohydrological system in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline was restricted to the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet. The Upper Triassic evaporitic basal detachment likely acted as a lower fluid barrier, preventing the input of fluids from deeper parts of the Pyrenean crustal thrust system.

However, neither the basement nor Hormuz salt are penetrated or imaged by available well and seismic data due to thick Phanerozoic sediments. In this study, we have used the residual gravity anomaly of the sedimentary layer throughout the UAE by subtracting the gravity response of the basement structure from the isostatic residual gravity anomaly. The structure and distribution of the low-density Hormuz salt were then delineated for the first time by applying a 3D constrained layer inversion method on the residual gravity anomaly of the sedimentary layer. Well data were used to constrain this inversion from which the density of the reference model and the isosurface of the Hormuz salt were defined, whilst seismic profiles were used to qualitatively check the location, shape and depth of the domal structures. The inversion model shows that the Hormuz salt is more widespread in offshore than in onshore UAE and generally occurs within NE-SW to N\u2013S trending basins. The inverted Hormuz salt model has a thickness that ranges from 1000 to 4000\u00a0m, with an average thickness of 2100\u00a0m. Moreover, the model suggests that the Hormuz, Ara (central Oman) and East Rub\u2019 Al Khali (Saudi Arabia) salt basins are most likely connected, except in regions of structural basement highs. In addition, the model reveals a low density (\u22642290\u00a0kg\/m3) shallow layer (0\u20136000\u00a0m below the sea level) in the foreland basin, which corresponds to the Aruma and Pabdeh sequences that infill the foreland basin. Many of the offshore hydrocarbon fields in the UAE such as Zakum, Umm Shaif and Sarb are associated with Hormuz salt domes. Also, several hydrocarbon fields adjoin basement highs, which are possibly related to the flexural bulge caused by the emplacement of the Semail ophiolite on the Arabian continental margin. The basement highs are probably bordered by faults, which could have initiated halokinesis of the Hormuz salt. Thus, the 3D inverted model provides a detailed distribution of Hormuz salt bodies, which allows an improved understanding of Palaeozoic hydrocarbon plays in the UAE.\n               ","19":"\n                  Interpretation of over 100,000 line-km of reprocessed 2D, time-migrated, seismic-reflection data from the U.S. Chukchi shelf documents at least four tectonic events in the last 400 m.y. that generated distinct inherited structures. A well stratified economic basement whose internal geometry clearly defines a pre-Mississippian, thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt represents the earliest recognizable tectonism in the area, one that accommodated west-east (present-day coordinates) shortening, probably in the Devonian. (1) The first inversion event, and dominant crustal feature in the Chukchi shelf, is the Hanna Trough, a north-south, failed rift system that accommodated more than 10\u00a0km of Carboniferous-Jurassic syn-rift and post-rift (sag) strata. Carboniferous extensional collapse of the previous orogenic belt to form the Hanna Trough was influenced heterogeneously by the pre-Mississippian contractional fabrics. Many rift-phase normal faults detach along pre-Mississippian thrust faults in discrete negative inversion, creating distinctive synthetic growth strata that constrain the geometry of extension. Other normal faults cut across pre-Mississippian stratigraphy showing more typical rollover geometries in growth strata and dissection of contractional structures in the pre-rift strata in more distributed negative inversion. (2) After a period of Pennsylvanian to Early Jurassic subsidence, in the south-central Chukchi shelf several north-south, rift-phase normal faults were inverted in a second event in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, forming local, asymmetric, positive inversion structures due to west-east shortening likely associated with far-field effects of the Chukotkan orogeny. The Hanna Trough then was buried beneath >2\u00a0km of Cretaceous and Cenozoic foreland-basin deposits during which complex additional deformation occurred in the region. (3) The North Chukchi high resulted from Late Cretaceous-Paleogene deep thrusting, both south- and north-directed, and possible transpressional inversion across a complex older structural fabric. (4) Cenozoic east-west extension and strike-slip faulting in the northern Hanna Trough reactivated Carboniferous rift structures, in the west as dominantly discrete motion on the older faults, and in the east in more distributed fashion coalescing near older rifts and cutting Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contractional structures during a final negative inversion. Documentation of multi-phase structural inheritance in the Chukchi shelf is vital to unraveling the tectonic history and influences on petroleum systems in the area.\n               ","20":"\n                  Pockmarks are morphological expressions of seabed fluid escape along continental margins. Identifying the underlying controls on their formation and spatial distribution is crucial for understanding substrate fluid plumbing systems and has important implications for hydrocarbon exploration, seafloor stability and seabed release of greenhouse gasses. Here, we use 3D seismic reflection dataset and a machine learning approach to present the first evidence for paleo-pockmarks in the Bass Strait, southeast Australia. The paleo-pockmarks are identified in the Bass Basin, within an interval between 250 and 310\u00a0m below present-day seafloor, corresponding to the Miocene carbonate-dominated Torquay Group. The paleo-pockmarks have depths ranging from \u223c29 to 74\u00a0m and areas between \u223c0.01 and 0.8\u00a0km2, with diameters varying between \u223c0.1 and 1.1\u00a0km. The absence of an underlying seal-bypass system such as pipes and faults associated with these paleo-pockmarks discounts a deeper thermogenic source or a potential magmatic-driven fluid system. Rather a biogenic fluid system derived from the degradation of organic-rich layers and pore water expelled during early-stage compaction is hypothesised to drive paleo-pockmark formation. The seismic interval comprising these paleo-pockmarks demonstrates a distinctive seaward progradation and stepping-down configuration, indicating a forced regression. We propose this resulted in the destabilization of hydrostatic pressure triggering the creation of the paleo-pockmarks.\n               ","21":"\n                  The along-strike variation of fault-related inversion folds within curved thrust systems is documented by presenting cases from the Central-Northern Apennines of Italy. Fold structures are reconstructed by integrating geological field data and structural restoration of various key balanced cross-sections, which are also constrained by the detailed interpretation of panoramic views, geological field mapping, and structural analysis. The lateral variation from fault-bend to fault-propagation folding is promoted by selective reverse reactivation of precursor, mainly rift-related, normal faults preferentially located along the oblique and frontal ramps. Their space variability is identified within single curved thrust systems of three different size testifying a scale-invariant phenomenon. Fault-bend reactivation and fault-propagation shortcut folding produce a characteristic fold interference pattern at the salient apex of the curved thrust system. The transition style depends on the pattern of the inherited normal fault template and on the amount of shortening achieved in the salient zone. The modest amount of shortening resulting from fault-related inversion folding along regional curved thrust systems is consistent with a basement-involved thick-skinned thrusting style. Recognition of fault-related inversion fold styles and of their along-strike variations represents a useful predictive tool when unravelling the kinematic evolution of curved orogenic belts resulting from positive inversion. Inversion fold development modes and their diagnostic features are also important for investigations of subsurface Earth resources.\n               ","22":"\n                  Petroleum reserves are abundant in the large-scale lacustrine fan delta reservoirs containing mixed oil in the Baikouquan Formation (MA131 Block, Junggar Basin). However, detecting such subtle reservoirs in the lacustrine foreland basins is challenging. High-resolution sequence stratigraphy, sedimentary basin evolution, and reservoir models are established by integrating the results obtained via wireline log data, cores, thin sections, and seismic data. A fifth-order sequence stratigraphic framework for the Baikouquan Formation is established, which enables the reconstruction of the sedimentary basin evolution and further detailing of the reservoir model, such that the correlation to multistage progradation and retrogradation of the fan delta complex can be determined. The study of core samples led to the identification of eight microfacies, of which sandy debris flows and distributary channels dominate approximately 80% of the depositional system. Stratal slices enable the characterization of the northern Xiazijie and eastern Madong fan-delta systems. The northern Xiazijie fan delta is widely distributed throughout sequences SSQ1\u2013SSQ6, whereas the Xiazijie fan delta underwent, in general, gradual retrogradation during the formation of sequences SSQ6 and SSQ7. The eastern Madong gravity flow fan-delta system only developed during the formation of sequences SSQ1\u2013SSQ5 at the location of an abrupt slope break. There are nine categories of reservoir models in the study area based on the source rocks, faults, and reservoirs. Geomorphology and climate are crucial in controlling the sedimentary infill. Deep faults and an unconformity between the Permian and the Triassic of the Mahu Sag played a decisive role in controlling the hydrocarbon migration pathways. The faults, source rocks, and microfacies together exert considerable control on hydrocarbon accumulation. Within the nearshore fan-delta front, variable reservoir quality can be observed. Crucial factors in improving reservoir quality are fine-grain size and relatively low clay content. This study may facilitate subtle reservoir characterization in other basins.\n               ","23":"\n                  The paper by Sayed et al.2020 presents detailed structural mapping of the Abu Roash Cretaceous outcrop (SW of Cairo) and integrates the mapping results with the tectonic evolution of the Kattaniya basin as one of the northern Egypt inverted basins. I present in this discussion a different age relationship between the folds and faults in the mapped area, where folds form after faults as push-up structures and faults form after folds as tear faults. I also comment on the relationship between the structural deformation of Abu Roash area and the deformation of the Kattaniya basin as the dextral wrenching of Abu Roash area is unique and does not represent the deformation of the northern Egypt inverted basins. Wrenching at Abu Roash formed a push-up structure at a stepover between ENE oriented faults whereas inversion in northern Egypt reactivated NE-SW oriented faults with predominant reverse slip and subordinate strike-slip. The main-bounding fault of Kattaniya basin is not located at Abu Roash outcrop but lies ~35 km to the NW. Basin inversion in northern Egypt continued to post-Early Miocene time, not earlier as suggested by Sayed et al.

A detailed sedimentological and petrophysical assessment, integrated with 3D seismic interpretation, constrained and delineated vertical and lateral facies changes within the field, which is also affected by complex fault and fracture patterns. Siliciclastic geo-bodies have been documented and mapped in 1D, 2D and 3D using seismic stratigraphy, seismic attributes and high-resolution seismic inversion reservoir characterization workflows. The spatial distribution of these geo-bodies appears to show the development of fluvio-deltaic systems in the southern and central sectors of the field, which evolved into marine dominated\/tidally influenced deltaic systems towards the northern and eastern sectors. Two major fluvial channels trends have been identified: SW-NE and W-E, with a dominantly NE trending deltaic progradation. Towards the north, elongated (tidal mouth?) sand bars have been interpreted with a NW-SE trend. An integrated sequence stratigraphic framework was consequently developed to better assess the influence of relative sea level changes on sedimentary facies. This framework pointed to the influence of marine incursions and subsequent flooding surfaces, which lead to the development of shale-rich seals and\/or baffles that could increase the probability of structural-stratigraphic trapping mechanisms in these depositional environments. This integrated workflow was utilized to update a numerical static reservoir model, which further de-risked future drilling locations and potentially charged reservoir volumes.\n               ","25":"\n                  Aptian carbonate rocks of Santos Basin in the Brazilian southeastern continental margin show a highly heterogeneous reservoir quality conditioned by many controlling factors. This study presents a quantitative approach based on an integrated petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical dataset of the Barra Velha Formation (BVF) to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of depositional and diagenetic aspects and the parameters controlling the nature and distribution of the diagenetic phases in Santos Basin pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. In this formation 3 units can be differentiated. The facies with higher Mg-clay content predominate in lower structural positions and regions with low relative relief. Higher proportions of spherulites occur in the transitional zones, and fascicular calcite occurs preferentially in the transitional and higher structural positions. Grainstones are observed in all depositional environments, but with variations in their composition (intraclasts, siliciclastic\/volcanoclastic grain, and clay content). Stratigraphically, facies with higher Mg-clay content predominate in Units 3 (base) and 2 (intermediate), whereas Unit 1 (top) is marked by a greater proportion of grainstones and fascicular calcite. In Unit 1, fascicular calcite crusts tend to expand from the structural high, toward lower areas. The distribution of the main diagenetic products and their association with different facies highlight the role of depositional setting and primary constituents on the diagenetic processes. The tectonic and climatic context of the BVF favored the preferential precipitation and accumulations of Mg-clays in lower structural portions of the basin. The preservation of Mg-clays is also strongly linked to the structural setting, with more intense diagenetic alterations in higher structural areas. Dolomite is a major diagenetic phase in the studied samples, followed by silica. These diagenetic phases are largely associated with Mg-clay alteration and predominate in Unit 1. Mg-clays dissolution, as well as major alteration of carbonate phases, are concentrated in higher structural positions. Given the higher occurrence of faults in these areas and the presence of saddle dolomite, barite, celestine, and fluorite, which are typical products of hydrothermal alteration, part of the dissolution processes may be related to hydrothermal alteration. The depositional and diagenetic aspects indicate a close connection between the hydrochemical evolution of the lake waters with the origin and diagenesis of these deposits.\n               ","26":"\n                  In the last decade, the discovery of unidirectionally upstream-migrating turbidite channels (UUMTCs) has aroused the interest of deepwater geologists due to giant gas fields explored in UUMTCs. However, their architecture, controlling factors and evolution history are unclear enough. Here, 3D seismic data from the Beijiao sag of the southern Qiongdongnan basin (QDNB) are used to document previously undescribed characteristics of seven UUMTCs in the lower middle Miocene. The results show that (1) UUMTCs are 5\u201310\u00a0km in length and 0.5\u00a0km in width and gradually terminate downslope, whose scales are far smaller than normal (relatively large-scale) UDMTCs elsewhere; (2) Stacking patterns of UUMTCs are characterized by unidirectional migration of multiple channel-levee complexes, whose seismic reflections record unilateral transition from high to low amplitudes from channel axis to off-axis positions; (3) Dip gradients (angles) of trajectories of UUMTCs are variable in the alongslope and downslope cross sections; (4) Polygonal faults are absent in the channel axes of UUMTCs and occur in the channel off-axis positions; (5) Channels (C1\u223c7) perpendicular to the slope are characterized by unidirectional migrations in the relatively steep slope, in contrast coeval channels (C8, 9) approximately parallel to the slope are featured by vertical aggradation in the gentle slope.\n                  Unlike terrigenous siliceous lithology of large-scale UUMTCs elsewhere, it is inferred that the lithology of herein (small-scale) UUMTCs is transitional from coarse-grained (carbonate sandstones) debris in the channel axis to fine-grained debris in the channel off-axis positions. Their controlling factors are summarized: carbonate sediment supply, relative sea level fluctuation, alongslope contour currents and local slope configuration. The orientation between turbidity flows and contour currents, controlled by local slope configuration, plays a vital role in the stacking pattern of channels, which are characterized by unidirectional migration of channels perpendicular to the strike of slope and are featured by vertical aggradation of channels parallel to the slope. Dip gradients are for the first time proposed as an optimal parameter for appraising the intensity change of contour currents crossing channels during their interaction, in agreement with the previous flume-tank experiments.

Based on the 3D stress model, the fault stability and pore pressures that are required to slip the faults were estimated.

It is one of the major NW-trending tectonic lineaments affecting the Calabrian Arc and is characterized by a present-day tectonic and gravity-driven deformation. This study investigated the portion of the PSSZ between the offshore Crotone Peninsula, located along the Ionian sea of Calabria, and the central part of the Sila Massif.\n                  A complex tectonic history is documented since middle Miocene onward for the PSSZ. It consists of an alternation of sinistral and dextral transpressional and transtensional tectonic phases correlated with the geodynamic events occurred during the SE migration of the Calabrian Arc.\n                  The shallow expression of the investigated part of the PSSZ consists of a roughly 14\u00a0km wide, ca. 80\u00a0km long NW-trending tectonic zone including synthetic NW- to NNW-trending faults and N-NE antithetic minor structures. The main identified NW-trending faults, which show a development between 30 and 50\u00a0km, are the Sila and Lakes faults in the Sila Massif, and the Marcedusa-Steccato, Fosso Umbro and Tacina faults located in the SW part of the Crotone Basin and in its offshore area. Currently, the fault segments of the Sila Massif exhibit a prevailing normal kinematics with a left-lateral component, whereas a more complex geological framework occurs in the south-western part of the onshore-offshore Crotone Basin. The latter is dominated by gravity-driven movements, associated with the SE migration of the Crotone Megalandslide and with the regional uplift of Calabria, whereas normal kinematics with a small left-lateral component of movement, locally replaced by reverse\/transpressional tectonics, was observed along the southern coast in the late Pleistocene deposits of the Le Castella marine terrace.\n                  The seismological data highlight that some strong earthquakes occurred in 1638, 1744 and 1832, with magnitude Mw between 5.7 and 6.8, might be associated with the Lakes, Fosso Umbro and Tacina faults respectively. In this frame, the PSSZ is proposed as a new potential NW-oriented active composite seismogenic source for the central-northern Calabria.\n               ","29":"\n                  High-resolution multichannel seismic transects that span from oceanic crust domains, and the Central Basin Fault rift to the Kyushu-Palau Ridge are utilized to investigate the dynamic mechanism of the Oligocene tectonic evolution in the West Philippine Basin based on an analysis of sismostratigraphic sequences and the geometries of acoustic substrates. In the oceanic domains, the physiography is characterized by ridges and troughs, and the pelagic stratigraphic succession with transparent facies covers the irregular top of the basement. Relatively homogeneous intracrustal reflections probably correspond to an area of abundant magma supply during the major spreading period. However, a widespread discrete, layered and high-amplitude intracrustal reflector is present in the Central Basin Fault rift that can be interpreted as an area of weaker and unstable magma supply after the major spreading period. The first group of reflectors shows typical low-angle fault shapes; the second and third groups of layered intracrustal reflectors are characterized by spatially limited high-amplitude seismic reflections. Inclined and mounded features of the intracrustal reflectors are interpreted as the result of tectonic processes, suggesting the presence of later magmatic accretion and transtensional tectonics within the acoustic substrate. Additionally, in the Kyushu-Palau Ridge, the anticline that appears within the stratigraphic infills of the basins serves as evidence of transtensional faulting. Overall, we propose that the Oligocene tectonic evolution of the West Philippine Basin occurred during a later transcurrent period due to Oligocene magmatic accretion followed by transtensional tectonics. The changes in the magmatic supply rate and tectonic processes of the Central Basin Fault rift may have originated from the compressive process within the Kyushu-Palau Ridge.\n               ","30":"\n                  The offshore Bangladesh includes the northern Bengal fan, where sediment supply from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers has resulted in the accumulation of up to 20\u00a0km of shallow-marine, fluvio-deltaic and slope sediments that have accumulated during rapid tectonic subsidence since the late Miocene. The high sedimentation rates, along with high organic matter content, make this area favorable for the formation of natural gas from both microbial and thermogenic sources. Here we use multichannel seismic reflection profiles and modelling of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) to present the first evidence for the occurrence of natural gas hydrate in the offshore Bangladesh. First, we analyze the sediments of the shelf and slope areas, which are characterized by downslope sediment transport features and by the presence, in places, of faults\/fractures as well as widely distributed amplitude anomalies and seismic facies that we relate to the presence of gas. A high-amplitude reversed polarity reflection of variable continuity that mimics the seafloor and cross-cut stratigraphy is interpreted as a Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR). The BSR is observed in several areas that are predominantly located in the E-SE of the study area, in water depths of 1300\u20131900 m and at depths below seafloor of 250\u2013440\u00a0m. Sediments above BSR locations generally show higher seismic interval velocities reaching values of \u223c1920\u20131940 m\/s, which are consistent with the presence of gas hydrate in shallow marine sediments. Furthermore, the BSR lies at approximately the same depth as the theoretical base of the gas (methane) hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ), calculated assuming a 3.5 % wt pore water salinity and using existing geothermal gradient and seafloor temperature data from the study region. However, in places, the BSR lies deeper or shallower than the base of the modelled BGHSZ. These discrepancies include areas where faults\/fractures and seismic evidence linked to fluid flow from deeper reservoirs reach the GHSZ disrupting its stratigraphic continuity. At these locations, we suggest that faults\/fractures act as fluid migration pathways causing localized heat-flow perturbations and\/or changes in the hydrate-forming gas composition both likely affecting the depth of the GHSZ.

However, the origin of the dolomites remains controversial due to the influence of volcanism and complex sedimentary environment. Therefore, a composite analysis of mineralogical and geochemical is utilized to study the origin and hydrocarbon generation potential of the P2l dolomite. The results showed that the P2l dolomite was the product of penecontemporaneous dolomitization, burial dolomitization, and local hydrothermal dolomitization. The evidence was as follows: (1) Under microscopy, a large number of dolomites had obvious trigonal rhomboid and zonal structure, indicating the existence of metasomatism. Besides, the P2l was characterized by an arid climate, suboxic-anoxic condition, and high salinity of the lake, with some evaporite minerals and low-order degree of the dolomite (0.4\u20130.6), which suggested that the dolomite was formed by penecontemporaneous rapid crystallization; (2) Part of the dolomites were characterized by a high content of Fe2+ and Mn2+, a moderately positive excursion of \u03b413CV-PDB values (2\u201312\u2030, avg. 7.4\u2030), a negative excursion of \u03b418OV-PDB values (\u221220 to \u22122.3\u2030, avg. \u221210.6\u2030), a high-order degree (0.7\u20130.8), a positive anomaly of Eu, and a certain enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs), indicating that it was caused by burial dolomitization; (3) Most of the dolomites were ankerite, and the speckled dolomite and veins were mostly developed near the fault zone, with a lower value of \u03b418OV-PDB (<\u22128\u2030), an obvious positive anomaly of Eu (1.01\u20131.68, avg. 1.28), and an obvious enrichment of LREEs, indicating a higher formation temperature. A large number of algal blooms caused by volcanic ash led to a high abundance of organic matter (OM) in the P2l dolomites, with total organic carbon (TOC) values ranging from 0.8 to 7.3% (avg. 2.7%). The lower limits of the TOC of the P2l dolomite as an effective source rock were determined to be 2.1%. Moreover, the hydrocarbon potential of the P2l dolomite, with abundant oil-prone OM (Type I and II1 kerogen with hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 142 to 975\u00a0mg\/g) in the stage of early mature to mature (Peak temperature of pyrolytic hydrocarbon peak (Tmax) and vitrinite reflectance (Ro) values ranging from 430 to 451\u00a0\u00b0C and 0.3\u20130.96%, respectively), is considerable.

High contents of brittle minerals and TOC, and traces of clay minerals show that the P2l holds a significant hydrocarbon generation potential.\n               ","32":"\n                  Buried volcanic systems are being increasingly studied due to their potential for hydrocarbon and geothermal exploration and subsurface storage of fluids such as CO2. Whilst widespread secondary porosity and fracturing increase reservoir potential in volcanic rocks and associated epiclastic deposits, these processes often also compromise seal integrity, leading to hydrocarbon leakage. Volcanism was widespread offshore northwestern New Zealand in the Miocene and petroleum has been discovered in the buried Kora stratovolcano. We analyse the petroleum system in this volcano using basin modelling to better understand controlling factors on the petroleum potential of buried volcanos. We reproduce charge of this accumulation from a marine source rock, the Waipawa Formation. In addition, there is significant potential for gas generation from Late Cretaceous coal measures of the Rakopi Formation. Modelling results are consistent with an effective fluid plumbing system and suggest that good quality connected reservoirs are present. In addition, Cretaceous faults that were reactivated in the Miocene act as migration pathways. However, models also suggest that significant amounts of petroleum have leaked during volcanic activity and related early maturation of source rocks. Models further predict that overburden and seal rock quality remain insufficient to support large petroleum accumulations. Low seal quality is consistent with the observation of high amplitude anomalies in reflection seismic data above the Kora volcano that are likely related to gas charged sediments and gas leakage. The occurrence of leakage is also consistent with extensive fracturing and oil shows in marine deposits overlying the volcano. These results highlight that the potential of buried volcanic systems to store petroleum and other fluids depends to a large extent on their structural evolution and burial history. On a global scale, hydrocarbon and greenhouse gas leakage of volcanos emplaced in petroliferous basins could have been significant in earth history with the potential to influence global climate.\n               ","33":"\n                  Prominent outcrops of the Pliocene Orinoco Delta along the southeast coast of Trinidad Island display a well-known, very thick Icehouse succession of storm-wave dominated delta lobes, as part of a 10\u201312\u00a0km thick Neogene continental-margin prism.

As one piece of the topset of the shelf-edge delta clinoform, this conduit displays features of the linkage hub between the landward on-shelf delta systems and the basinward slope deposits.\n                  New fieldwork and a re-examination of the incision-infill reveal new details and suggest three possible origins of the conduit: \u2460 the first is a no river feeder, shelf-edge collapse scar, extending onto the upper slope and infilled by deeper to shallower deposits. This shelf-edge cutting canyon interpretation is supported by the presence of hardground ichnology on the steep walls of the incision and the abundance of chaotic blocks and debrites in the lower two-thirds of the incision infill. \u2461 The second is a shelf channel or valley linking fluvial channels to on-shelf and outer shelf deltas. This river-connected, subaqueous shelf valley origin, is supported by the upward-coarsening nature of the infill succession and especially the occurrence of shallow-water tidal channels in the upper third of the infill. \u2462 The third is a canyon developed mainly during transgression or highstand with a collapsed canyon-head infill and an overlying muddy tidal-channel system that had only limited sediment bypass to the deepwater slope and basin floor. This case represents both the shallow-water and the deeper water features of the infill succession, and is supported by similar large shelf-edge collapse features seen elsewhere in the Cruse and Moruga Formations of the paleo-Orinoco margin. This case, unrelated to river supply, also benefits from slight rotational shelf-edge uplift to trigger collapse.\n                  The known Cedar Grove growth fault was active and located some 4\u00a0km to the west from the present coast on the southeast corner of Trinidad Island. The growth-fault trapped thickened outer shelf to shelf-edge delta-front and delta-plain sediments within the hanging-wall compartment as the fault stretched about 20\u00a0km along strike. All the shelf-edge aggradation and its partial collapse were likely triggered by growth-faulting. After some muddy backfilling and coarse-grained block collapse into the invaginated shelf-edge, this scalloped area attracted a belt of subaqueous tidal channels, thus healing the eroded topography.\n               ","34":"\n                  Changes in stacking patterns of facies, stratal architecture and shoreline trajectory along depositional strike are mainly dependent on along-strike differences in factors such as physical processes (rivers, waves, tides), tectonics, eustatic changes, sediment supply, and local physiography. The lower-upper Ordovician successions (Lashkerak Formation) deposited in a Peri-Gondwana shallow continental shelf have been interpreted using the sequence stratigraphic concepts. This approach allowed to highlight main differences along-strike in the co-existing depositional systems (coastal plains, estuaries, deltas, and shoreline to shelf systems) in the Alborz basin along the northern edge of Gondwana. On the basis of sedimentary and ichnological characteristics, the siliciclastic successions are divided into four facies associations: (i) Wave-dominated estuarine, (ii) Wave-dominated shoreface-offshore complex, (iii) Mixed fluvial (F)- and wave (W)-influenced delta (Fw and Wf), and (iv) Tide-dominated, fluvial-influenced delta (Tf). Six third-order depositional sequences (DS1-DS6) were recognized, each of them are bounded by unconformities and pronounced shifts in the facies. Along depositional strike (NE\/SW- a distance of c. 150\u00a0km), significant intrabasinal changes in sediment supply produced evident lateral changes in the shoreline trajectory and stratal architecture, of the DS1-DS3 (Tremadocian-Floian), may be attributed to differences in physical processes (rivers, waves, tides activity) and topographic irregularities derive probably by different rates of subsidence in the basin. During the deposition of the DS1-DS3, a significant along-strike differences in the composition of ichnological suites and the lifestyle of benthonic organisms, dependent on the relative supremacy of wave, storm, river, and tidal processes. Sedimentary supply and processes are the main controlling factors for the stratigraphic architecture rather than the tectonic activity between Tremadocian and Floian. While during the Darriwilian-Katian interval (DS4-DS6), the tectonic activity predominates with the beginning of extensional phases related to the rifting in the Alborz basin causing the activation of syn-depositional normal faults and the development of block-faulted craton-ward margin. Typically, differential subsidence due to extensional tectonic activity causes the uplift of tectonic blocks west of the Alborz Basin into the emerging areas, on one hand, and simultaneous deepening-upward stacking patterns (i.e., increased subsidence rates) in the hanging-wall depocenters of east of the Alborz Basin, on the other hand. This outcrop-based study suggests that the identification of genetically related depositional units in a larger paleogeographic context is fundamental for understanding along-strike variability in controlling mechanisms of the spatial distribution and stratigraphic architecture of coexisting and linked depositional systems.\n               ","35":"\n                  Large volumes of black and volatile oils have been recently discovered from 7000\u00a0m to 8400\u00a0m below surface in the Tarim Basin. Diamondoids, compounds recalcitrant to thermal stress, have been applied to estimate the extent of oil-cracking, but uncertainties remain concerning additional influences, such as evaporative fractionation and biodegradation. To investigate controls on diamondoid abundance in oil reservoirs, we performed detailed geochemical characterizations of biomarkers and diamondoids of twenty-eight oils from the Halahatang sub-Depression in the Tabei area of the Tarim Basin. Based on the results, the oils belong to one population. Three oils in the northeastern Halahatang area show the coexistence of n-alkanes and 25-norhopanes, indicating that early-expelled oils were severely biodegraded and then mixed with later, fresh charges of oil. Multiple molecular maturity indices suggest that oil maturities increase with depth. Interestingly, 3- + 4-methyldiamantanes, which should be enriched in highly mature oils, are found to be more abundant in less mature oils from shallower reservoirs, with exceptions of only four samples in the northeast. Published data for the eastern Lunnan area display a similar pattern that diamondoids are progressively enriched in shallower oils. The special pattern is interpreted to be the result of phase fractionation induced by a gas-dominated late charge. The late charge of gas firstly extracted diamondoids from deep-buried, highly-cracked oils through evaporative fractionation. As the vapor migrated towards the up-dip direction, decrease of pressure and temperature led to condensation of the diamondoids in the vapor. Briefly, the diamondoids were transferred to relatively shallow reservoirs through a combination of evaporative fractionation and subsequent phase separation. Alternatively, the abnormal enrichment of diamondoids in the northern part may be because of locally vertical charges of highly mature, diamondoid-rich gases through large faults.\n               ","36":"\n                  On the Barents Shelf, the northernmost and least explored hydrocarbon province of the Norwegian Continental Shelf, Upper Jurassic organic-rich shales have traditionally been given most attention as these represent the most prolific source rock unit of the region. However, in the western frontier areas of the Barents Shelf, the Upper Jurassic is too deeply buried. By combining high-resolution 2D seismic data, well logs, and digitalized Rock-Eval data, this study documents the lateral distribution and variability of alternative source rock units within the Lower Cretaceous succession on the SW Barents Shelf. Negative high-amplitude anomalies are traced from shallow basins on the platform westward into deeper basins along the western shelf margin. The anomalies are tied to intervals of increased total organic carbon contents in several exploration wells, and we thus establish the presence of four potential source rock units; these are the (1) upper Hauterivian, (2) Barremian, (3) lower Aptian, and (4) upper Cenomanian units. Based on the distribution of the associated seismic anomalies, we infer that the deposition and preservation of these organic-rich units are coupled to localized, fault bounded depocenters, mainly controlled by Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous rifting and local reactivation events. The lower Aptian stands out as the most significant source rock unit, particularly in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, where it displays a kerogen Type II composition. The distribution and development of this oil-prone source rock unit is linked to an early Aptian fault reactivation event. Due to increased sediment influx in combination with high subsidence rates during the Albian to Cenomanian, potential pre-Aptian source rock units appear to have undergone too deep burial in the Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins to be presently generative. Furthermore, organic matter dilution due to increased sedimentation rates seems to have reduced the overall potential of the upper Cenomanian unit.\n               ","37":"\n                  Convergent plate margins could have an immediate impact on intraplate deformation in the adjacent sedimentary basin. In the Tarim Basin, a strike-slip fault network in the Guchengxu High is adjacent to the Tethys (northern Tibetan Plateau). This paper uses high-quality 3-D seismic data to unravel the geometry and kinematics of the strike-slip fault network and the genetic relationship with the Tethys tectonics. Within the fault network, the left-lateral NNE- and ENE-oriented strike-slip faults are a result of sequential evolution rather than conjugate faults. The sub-vertical ENE-oriented strike-slip faults are widely spaced with stepping-segmented geometry in the west, whereas they are relatively clustered with larger vertical throws close to the Cherchen fault. They were interpreted as a series of the Cherchen fault-related structures due to oblique blocking of the Tazhong Uplift and block deflection. It responded to the Late Ordovician Altyn Tagh\/Tarim collisional orogeny and the Cherchen fault. The NNE-oriented strike-slip faults are characterized by underlying sub-vertical faults and two layers of overlying normal faults. These NNE-oriented strike-slip faults have large transversal compressional components, commonly presenting reverse drags on both sides of the underlying sub-vertical faults. These NNE-oriented faults initiated on pre-existing discontinuities (extensional joints) and offset the ENE-oriented ones when NNW-oriented stress was transmitted to plate interiors during this Late Ordovician orogeny. Afterward, two layers of overlying normal faults formed due to dragging of the covers during the Middle Silurian\u2013Early Carboniferous reactivation and the Late Carboniferous\u2013Early Permian inversion, in response to subduction of the Kunlun Ocean and opening of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, respectively. The strike-slip fault network in plate interiors evolved as immediate responses to the Tethys tectonics at plate boundaries.\n               ","38":"\n                  The Lixian Slope is located in the western part of the Raoyang Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, Northern China. This slope was developed due to exceptionally weak tectonic activities; therefore, it is aptly called a weak tectonic slope. The slope gradients, faults, sandbodies, source rocks, and oil-source correlation were evaluated. During the development of the Lixian Slope, its gradients were usually low (generally less than 1.00\u00b0). Most of the faults have low fault throws (usually less than 30\u00a0m). Moreover, the faults of this slope have poor vertical transporting capacity. The sandstone-to-strata ratios for different Paleogene strata of the Lixian Slope are generally less than 40%, suggesting that the connectivity of sandbodies in the Paleogene strata is poor. In addition, research on the sources of crude oil indicates that the oil in most slope areas originated from Es1x source rocks. The study of the controls on hydrocarbon accumulation in the Lixian Slope indicates the following: 1) the planar distribution of oil and gas reservoirs in the Lixian Slope is strictly controlled by both the Es1x and Ek\u2013Es4 source rocks, the Es1x in particular; 2) the sandbodies, faults, and low gradients control the planar enrichment of hydrocarbons; and 3) the faults and source rocks control the vertical distribution of oil and gas reservoirs. According to the characteristics of and controls on hydrocarbon accumulation, a hydrocarbon accumulation model suitable for a weak tectonic slope is proposed. Finally, a few recommendations for future explorations are suggested. The Es2 and Es1 members, especially those near the NNE\u2013NEE trending faults, are critical target intervals for future exploration operations.\n               ","39":"\n                  The Greater Caucasus doubly-vergent orogenic system has its origin in a Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic back-arc-type basin, floored by an extensively stretched and heavily intruded continental crust that has subsequently been inverted. Our field investigations along the Georgian Military Road in the eastern Central Greater Caucasus provide insights in its tectonic structure and reveal a bivergent orogenic wedge geometry. The southward propagating pro-wedge comprises the Southern Slope tectonic imbricate system developed in the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic basin infill and the Transcaucasian Kartli foreland fold-and-thrust belt and is actively underthrust by the Transcaucasian Dzirula-Shatsky Block. The retro-wedge, on the other hand, incorporates the Northern Slope tectonic zones (including the Homocline Range) and the North Caucasian Terek-Sunzha foreland fold-and-thrust belt that developed in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover of the Scythian Platform. The Main Range forms the axial zone of the mountain belt where crystalline, pre-Mesozoic basement is locally brought to the surface at almost 3000\u00a0m altitude along the Main Caucasus Thrust.\n                  Our study of the regional geology, in combination with paleotectonic reconstructions suggests that the present-day tectonic units of the Caucasus correspond to distinct pre-collisional paleotectonic domains that existed in the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic Neotethys-Eurasia ocean-continent convergence zone. The focus of our study lies on the tectonic interpretation of the Greater Caucasus fold-and-thrust belt. We propose to interprete the major thrusts of the orogen as former normal listric detachments occurring in the Greater Caucasus Basin, that were reactivated as reverse faults and thrusts during the collisional events of the Arabia-Eurasia convergence since the Late Eocene-Oligocene (Alpine inversion stage).\n               ","40":"\n                  Various gases are generated in the subsurface, by diagenetic processes, fluid\/rock interactions, maturation of petroleum source rocks and microbial activity. Often these gases just leak at the surface but sometimes they may accumulate in a subsurface trap. The present study investigates the case of the southern part of the Amadeus Basin, Australia, where exploration wells tested a blend of hydrocarbon (HC), helium (He) and hydrogen (H2). In Mt Kitty-1 well, He- and H2-rich gases were reported (He \u223c9%, H2 \u223c11.4%) with traces of HC, whereas C1 and C2+ HC gases associated with He were discovered in Magee-1 well. Seismic and well data elucidate accumulation of the gas blend within a classical subsurface system with a structural trap, a permeable reservoir and a thick salt layer as seal. This salt, the Proterozoic Upper Gillen, is overlying the Heavitree sandstones and fractured basement reservoirs. The former is dominated by intergranular porosity (\u223c13%), whereas the latter is commonly associated with complex patterns of fractures associated with deep-seated faults. The sources of blended gases are different: thermal cracking of organic matter for hydrocarbons, radiolytic decay of radioelements for helium. Radiolysis, and water reduction as well as oxidation of hydrocarbons are open hypothesizes for H2 generation in the study region. Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic tectonic episodes (e.g. Petermann; Alice Springs) allowed the formation of various structural traps where the gas blend was accumulated.\n                  The large quantity of He, light gas slowly generated by the crustal radioactivity indicates that the seal is very efficient and that accumulations could have been in place for millions of years very likely with an evolving CH4\/H2\/He ratios through time. The presence of gas chimneys and surface depressions in the basin indicate that the generation, and\/or migration of the gases are still active. All the data are consistent with a long-term accumulation of this gas blend, different from the short term H2 retention in the reservoir that was proposed in other contexts such as in Mali.\n               ","41":"\n                  Paleozoic carbonate buried hills with burial depths of more than 4500\u00a0m (14,764\u00a0ft) in the Bozhong sag of the Bohai Bay Basin are rich in natural gas resources, categorized as typical ultradeep fracture-related reservoirs. Based on the data of (sidewall) cores, thin sections, electrical image logs, three-dimensional seismic observations, and physical properties, we evaluated the fracture characteristics and elucidated the dominant controls on effective (unfilled) fractures. Tectonic fractures are the main components in these reservoirs. The intersecting relationships, widths, and strikes of the fractures as well as the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of the fill materials indicate that NWW- and NE-trending tectonic fractures developed. The NWW-trending fractures are related to the compressional tectonic stress field of the Indosinian orogeny and account for nearly 80% of the fractures, with widths ranging from 40 to 160\u00a0\u03bcm; 43% of them are filled with carbonate and quartz. The dissolution of meteoric water mainly occurred with this set of tectonic fractures and formed an upper dissolved zone within 200\u00a0m beneath the weathering crust. Related fill materials have \u22122\u2030 to 2\u2030 \u03b413C and \u22128\u2030 to \u221213\u2030 \u03b418O. The group of NE-trending fractures accounted for approximately 20% of all fractures, with widths ranging from 200 to 280\u00a0\u03bcm, and are related to the faulting during the Himalayan orogeny, which contributed to the formation of subsequent NE-trending fractures and reopened prior NWW-trending fractures. Some fill materials present negative \u03b413C and \u03b418O values, distributed from \u22122\u2030 to \u22126\u2030 and \u221213\u2030 to \u221220\u2030, respectively. These negative values revealed the influence of Cenozoic hydrothermal fluids and organic acids, which contributed to the development of an internal fracture-related dissolved zone that developed beneath 400\u2013600\u00a0m from the top of the basement. The analysis demonstrates that the direction of in situ maximum principal stress is subparallel to the fracture trends, which is the key factor for maintaining the effectiveness of the fractures. The coupling of Cenozoic tectonic reactivation and multiple genetic fluids controls the effectiveness of ultradeep carbonate reservoirs.\n               ","42":"\n                  Fold-and-thrust belts are important locations for oil and gas exploration, but due to the complex sources, migration, and charging histories the exploration risk is extremely high. The Longmenshan belt in the NW Sichuan Basin offers an excellent opportunity to study the genesis and sources of natural gas in fold-and-thrust belt. We synthesize existing geochemical data from \u223c1100 samples from various strata in the Sichuan Basin. Among them, the bitumen biomarkers and the natural gas molecular compositions and stable carbon isotopes in the Middle Permian of different structural belts were analyzed to investigate the gas genetic types and sources. Then, they were compared with natural gas from other strata in the Sichuan Basin. Results indicate that the Middle Permian natural gases in the NW Sichuan Basin are dominated by hydrocarbon gases, with a small amount of CO2 and N2. The identification of the gas origin and gas-source correlation indicate that there are significant differences between the Middle Permian natural gas in different structural belts of the Longmenshan belt. The natural gas in the thrust nappe belt is mainly oil-cracking gas from the Qiongzhusi Formation (Fm) source rock, and the natural gas in the thrust front belt shows obvious mixed-source characteristics, with both kerogen-cracking gas of the Permian source rocks and oil-cracking gas from the Qiongzhusi Fm source rock. However, the natural gas in the unfaulted belt mainly comes from the kerogen-cracking gas in the Permian source rocks. Overall, from the thrust nappe belt to the thrust front belt, and then to a belt that is largely unfaulted, the contribution of deep source rocks controlled by fault migration channels decreases with gradually weakening deformation. This study will help to better understand the petroleum system in the fold-and-thrust belt and optimize the future exploration strategy.\n               ","43":"\n                  Located at the junction between the Beibuwan Basin and the Song Hong Basin in the Gulf of Tonkin, the Bach Long Vi (BLV) island offers a rare window into the Cenozoic geology of Indochina and surrounding region. The island exposes 5\u00a0km-long continuous outcrop of weakly to moderately dipping Oligocene deep-lake deposits along the coastline. Using integrated UAV imaging and modern field methods, we characterized the deformation on the island at unprecedented level of details, and then related these features to regional tectonic events. BLV's mudstone-rich succession was intruded by pervasive sand injectites which consist of three main types: linear dikes, irregular dikes, and irregular sandstone bodies. Linear dikes and irregular dikes are found throughout most of the island. Linear dikes are steeply dipping, trend dominantly ENE, and tends to be thicker close to the top of the island stratigraphy. Irregular dikes have contorted shapes both in plan view and cross-section, and often connect adjacent linear dike segments. Irregular sandstone bodies are located toward the highest part of the island stratigraphy, and are characterized by depositional sands modified by sand injection processes. Most of the sand injectites on BLV constitute an interconnected complex that formed at the same time, probably in the late Oligocene during syn-rift. Sand injectites are later cross-cut by NW-SE left-lateral and its conjugate NE-SW right-lateral strike-slip faulting. The inferred ENE-trending maximum principal stress and NNW-trending minimum principal stress of this deformation is compatible with the regional end-Oligocene inversion as indicated by seismic data.\n               ","44":"\n                  The Liaodong Bay Depression was shaped by the Bohai Bay rift basin (BBRB) and the Tan-Lu strike-slip fault system (TSFS) in the Cenozoic and has undergone a tectonic transition from rifting to strike-slip. Therefore, it is an ideal region to study the transition from rifting to strike-slip. Based on new 3D serial seismic data interpretation, we investigated the types and formation times of the main faults in the Liaodong Bay Depression and restored them within the palaeogeography of each evolution stage. Our results show that the Liaodong Bay Depression underwent a tectonic transition from rifting to strike-slip: (1) The mantle material upsurge caused by the Izanagi plate trapped in the mantle transition zone led to rifting of the Liaodong Bay Depression from the Palaeocene to the Eocene. (2) In the middle Eocene, the change in the subduction direction of the Pacific plate led to dextral strike-slip movement along the Tan-Lu fault zone. (3) The rifting and strike-slip in the Liaodong Bay depression are related, and the transition from rifting to strike-slip occurred from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene. The strike-slip faults developed when rifting was weak in the Oligocene. The transition from rifting to strike-slip faulting formed oil-gas accumulation zones along the strike-slip fault zone and thus resulted in the good oil and gas exploration prospects of this area.\n               ","45":"\n                  The control of normal fault growth by preexisting basement structures is still a worldwide matter of debate. The objectives of the present study are (i) to investigate where rift faults nucleate in continental-scale ductile shear zones and how these zones influence fault architecture; (ii) how subvertical basement fabric controls listric fault geometry and evolution; (iii) how long reactivation of faults lasts; and (iv) which are the implications of fault reactivation for the oil industry. We contribute to these issues by defining the 3-D relationship between preexisting ductile strike-slip shear zones, the geometry and evolution of subsequent rift-related normal faults using airborne magnetic, 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection, and structural data from the Rio do Peixe Basin, a Cretaceous intracontinental basin in northeastern Brazil. Our results indicate that Precambrian mylonitic foliation and faults share a common strike at the surface, but not a common dip, mostly because the Precambrian shear zones are planar and the reactivated faults are listric (curved). The combined magnetic anomaly and seismic reflection help understand the 3-D geometrical relation between inherited structures and Cretaceous brittle reactivation, which is not obvious from the field data. As inferred from subsurface information, the mylonitic foliation (sub-vertical dip) and shear zone boundary (ca. 60\u00b0 dip, parallel to brittle faulting) are not parallel. The basin-bounding faults reactivated along ductile shear zones that separate major terranes with mechanical contrast. We conclude that the map view spatial coincidence of Precambrian ductile shear zones and main brittle faults can be deceiving. Mylonitic foliation and faults are parallel along strike but not along dip, indicating that the geometry of rift faults is not controlled by the mylonitic foliation, but by the mechanical contrast between tectonometamorphic units separated by ductile shear zones.\n               ","46":"\n                  The salt-rich Orpheus rift basin, part of the eastern North American (ENAM) rift system, formed during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic prior to opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Using a dense grid of 2D seismic-reflection lines, data from nearby wells, and information from adjacent ENAM rift basins, we have established a tectonostratigraphic framework, identified key structural elements, and reconstructed the deformation history for the eastern part of the basin. Our work shows that a series of E-striking, S-dipping faults with normal separation bound the basin on the north. Deformation within the basin is complex with forced folds above deep-seated intrabasin faults, detachment folds, detached thrust faults, and salt diapirs. The synrift evaporite sequence consists of an older massive salt unit that underlies a younger unit with two distinct interfingering facies. Facies A, consisting of salt and interbedded sedimentary rocks (likely shales), developed near the border-fault system and its relay ramps. Facies B, consisting of massive salt with few interbedded sedimentary rocks, developed toward the basin center. The youngest synrift unit accumulated exclusively within minibasins near the northern border-fault system. Based on location, this youngest synrift unit likely consists of coarse-grained and poorly sorted alluvial-fan or talus-slope deposits shed from the footwall. All synrift units are intruded by igneous sheets likely associated with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and, thus, are mostly Late Triassic in age (or possibly older). The border-fault system profoundly affected deposition within the eastern Orpheus rift basin by providing pathways for clastic sediment input into the salt-rich basin. These depositional patterns subsequently influenced deformation associated with lateral salt flow during minibasin formation. In regions with interbedded salt, detachment folds and thrust faults developed, whereas salt walls and stocks developed in regions with more massive salt.\n               ","47":"\n                  We describe the structure, stratigraphy, and hydrocarbon potential of the 1000-km-long Tarfaya-Dakhla Basin (TDB) along the Atlantic rifted-passive margin of Morocco. Our dataset consists of a 4885-line km grid of depth-converted industry seismic data tied to three DSDP wells in the deepwater area and exploratory wells on the slope and shelf. Based on mapping of this seismic grid, the tectonostratigraphic events that have affected this margin include: 1) a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rift phase that separated the Moroccan margin from its conjugate margin in eastern Canada began during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic; 2) early passive margin sedimentation consists of Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous passive margin phase consisting of a massive, 14-km-thick, reefal-carbonate platform formed above the rifted margin during the Early Jurassic and was subsequently buried by the 6-km-thick, Early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Boujdour deltaic complex. During this period continued high rates of clastic sedimentation resulted in margin steepening and gravitational collapse during the Valanginian and formed a 480-km-long and 68-km-wide passive margin fold belt characterized by a zone of updip normal faults of 480\u00a0km in length and 30\u00a0km in width and a zone of downdip folds and thrusts of 117\u00a0km in length and 15\u00a0km in width. Geochemical data from DSDP 397 and 369 wells and two pseudo-wells were used to evaluate source rock potential and hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Jurassic to Recent section. Basin modeling reveals that the Jurassic source rocks known from DSDP drilling are presently overmature in the study area with hydrocarbon generation beginning in the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The Lower Cretaceous source rocks are immature except for localized areas, and the Upper Cretaceous is immature across the study area.\n               ","48":"\n                  The Zeit basin is located on the western coast of the Gulf of Suez. It is a major, elongated half-graben structure with faults dipping steeply to the southwest. The Zeit basin contains the thickest Miocene sediments and evaporites in the Gulf of Suez. Many exploration activities have been conducted in and around the study area due to the known presence of hydrocarbon resources. In petroleum exploration, the estimation of basement depth (or sedimentary thickness) is a primary exploration risk parameter, in particular, for estimation of heat flow. The magnetic method is one of the few methods that can be used to study the basement structure and estimate the top basement depth. In this paper, the top basement geometry, distribution of the magnetic susceptibility and the basement depth of the Zeit basin were investigated using 3-D forward magnetic modeling and the 3-D inversion of geo-magnetic data. The 3-D forward modeling of the aeromagnetic field data from the Zeit basin area revealed a NW-SE trending half-graben structure, consistent with the known geology of the study area. Magnetic susceptibility cutoff 0.005 SI was applied to show the subsurface relationships among the basement sedimentary units. The calculated depth of the Zeit basin is around 4\u20135\u00a0km. The magnetic field data, calculated using the Gauss Legendre quadrature method, generally agree with the measured data as well as data calculated using the inversion process.

The No. 5 strike-slip fault system in the Shuntuoguole Low Uplift in the Tarim Basin, China, interacts with Cambrian salt layers at depth. In the present study, a part of this fault system was investigated to assess structural characteristics of the Yijianfang (Ordovician carbonate layer) and the Wusonggeer (Cambrian salt layer) formations. Seismic data reveal three structural styles in the salt layer including transpression, transtension, and pure strike-slip. In transpressional segments, the salt layer is thinned accross the fault plane; transtensional segments involve minor reactive salt diapirs, and pure strike-slip segments display no noticeable variation in the salt thickness. The impact of the deep strike-slip salt tectonics on petroleum exploration in the area is discussed using data from seven wells. Wells in transpressional segments, where the salt is thin, are characterized by good production, whereas those in transtensional segments, where the salt is thick, exhibit poor production. The salt prevents the migration of oil and gas along the strike-slip fault. Strike-slip salt structures examined in the present study improve the understanding of the associated tectonics in the central Tarim Basin and provide insights on hydrocarbon migration and accumulation in the basin.\n               ","50":"\n                  Deep-routed fluid seepage conduits are widely distributed in the Southern South China Sea (SSCS), and gas hydrates have been discovered inside these conduits through drilling and logging.

Multiple types of deep-routed conduits\u2014which typically manifested as mud volcanoes, diapirs, fluid-escape pipes, and paleo-uplift associated faults\u2014were identified. These manifestations were generally accompanied by Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs), blanking zones, locally enhanced reflections, \"pulled-up\" reflections, pockmarks, mounds, and gas plumes, which indicated fluid seepage and possible gas hydrate accumulation. The Sulfate Methane Transition Zone (SMTZ) in the fluid seepage sites occurred at relatively shallow depths of 325\u2013660 cmbsf (centimeter below the seafloor), suggesting a high methane flux and sufficient gas supply. The carbon isotope composition of the methane (\u221292.6\u2030\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b413C\u00a0<\u00a0\u221250.2\u2030) and the detection of ethane, propane, and n-butane, as well as multiple geological configuration biomarkers, all indicate that deep-sourced hydrocarbons and thermogenic gas have migrated into the shallow layer through deep-routed conduits. Several geological and geochemical anomalies, including gas expansion, gas bubbling in piston core sediments, negative pore water chloride anomalies, and \u03b418O enrichment (3.8\u2030\u00a0<\u00a0\u03b418O\u00a0<\u00a04.1\u2030) in the cold seep carbonates, provide evidence of hydrate dissociation during core recovery. The deep-routed fluid seepage and the accompanying hydrocarbon gas supply have a significant influence on the potential thermogenic gas-sourced hydrate accumulation and evolution. Overall, the co-existence of fracture-filling hydrates and pore-filling hydrates formed from the same supply of thermogenic gas and biogenic gas was inferred through comprehensive study and comparison with adjacent hydrate drilling areas. This article is the first systematic study of the characteristics of hydrate accumulation under the fluid seepage background in the Beikang Basin, and it provides a favorable reference for revealing the relationship between deep-sourced fluid seepage and hydrate formation. However, more exploration work needs to be conducted to confirm the above assumptions.\n               ","51":"\n                  In the Hikurangi subduction wedge (New Zealand), a strong relationship exists between tectonic structures and fluid migrations. In the study area, outcropping tubular carbonate concretions, corresponding to the shallow subsurface plumbing systems of paleo-cold seeps, are hosted by Miocene syn-subduction mudstones. New observations demonstrate the presence of migrated solid bitumen within the tubular concretions and in the fault gouge of a major fault zone. A multi-proxy approach was performed to determine the organic matter thermal maturity in the study area (organic matter petrography and solid bitumen reflectance (BR) Rr% (Rr: random reflectance)). We also used Rock-Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance (VR) Rr%, and clay mineral reaction progress (illite K\u00fcbler-Index and clay mineral paragenesis) to determine the diagenesis grade of the rocks. Low Tmax values and clay minerals indicate a thermally immature sedimentary cover. The main source rock of the region, the Waipawa Formation is locally thermally mature (VR\u00a0=\u00a00.86 Rr%) suggesting that tectonic thrust-sheet stacking isresponsible for a structural thickening causing local organic maturation. The seaward propagation of out-of-sequence thrusts at base of intra-slope basins could be responsible for the inititation of biogenic fluid flows sourced in the shallow sedimentary cover that is subjected to deformation above the blind thrusts, leading to the earlier generation of the first carbonate tubular concretions. With the continuation of blind thrusting, deep thermogenic fluids then migrated laterally through fault planes (primary migration) and finally vertically through the intrabasinal pre-existing tubular concretions (secondary migration). In this paper, solid bitumen is used for the identification of a fossil thermogenic fluid migration from the source rock, along faults and through tubular carbonate conduits within a subduction thrust-wedge. The study evidences a multi-genetic tubular concretion formation, related with the timing and style of the deformation, being therefore a potential reliable indicator for the evolution of tectonic activity.\n               ","52":"\n                  Seal integrity is a key property for petroleum exploration. This is even more the case in uplifted basins, as exemplified by the northern Barents Shelf. Uplift may lead to fracturing, decompaction, gas expansion and fluid flow. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanical behaviour of the Jurassic shale caprocks in the Greater Hoop area, where hydrocarbon accumulations are situated as little as 250\u00a0m below the seabed. In this contribution we study the Upper Jurassic Fuglen and Hekkingen formations. We analyse the mechanical properties of six wells in the study area in combination with leak-off tests and 3D seismic data to characterise the caprock variability over the area. Ductility appears to be largely a response to total organic content, with overall sealing properties appearing exceptionally good in southern parts but diminishing to the north in the study area due to increasing silt content and thinning of the more organic rich Hekkingen Formation.\n               ","53":"\n                  The Bunguran Trough is a deep Tertiary basin depocentre in the West Luconia Delta Province, Sarawak Basin, offshore Malaysia. At the centre of the trough, the top of the acoustic basement is \u223c15\u00a0km deep, buried beneath a thick pile of Late Eocene to Quaternary coastal-deltaic sediments of the proto-Rajang-Lupar River delta system. Sediment thickness, bathymetry and gravity data were utilized to re-construct the crustal structure of the West Luconia Delta and the Bunguran Trough. The results indicate an average crustal thickness of 5.3\u00a0km beneath the Bunguran Trough, which is extremely thin compared to the extended continental crust (\u223c15\u201322\u00a0km) beneath the adjacent West, Central and North Luconia provinces. Extreme crustal thinning is confined to the Bunguran Trough, which appears to have steeply faulted boundaries, but the nature of the faults is obscured by the thick sedimentary pile.\n                  Structural evidences from reflection seismic data suggest widespread extensional faulting throughout Sarawak Basin although some major tectonic lineaments may have had significant strike-slip movements due to later reactivation and basin inversion. Both extensional and strike-slip faulting may have contributed to the formation and subsidence of the Bunguran Trough. West Balingian Line is a major fault zone that seems to have had a significant strike-slip displacement history and probably had an important role during basin initiation. Seismic data suggests that this fault zone extends from the Balingian and Tatau provinces into West Luconia as a major strike-slip fault with a releasing bend along which the Bunguran Trough may have developed. Crustal extension in a pull-apart basin may have been initiated by sinistral motion along the fault during Late Eocene-Oligocene. Alternatively, the widespread normal faulting indicates that the Bunguran Trough may have developed as a rift basin which experienced at least two phases of extension before a major inversion event which is marked by the Middle Miocene Unconformity (MMU). The main phase of subsidence in the Bunguran Trough had occurred during the active extensional phase before the MMU.\n               ","54":"\n                  Restoration of interpreted 2D deep seismic lines across Australia's North West Shelf indicates that rifting style changed significantly during multiple phases of extension and continental breakup. Early phase rifting during the Neo-Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, characterised by low-angle detachment faults, crustal-scale necking and hyperextension of the crust (Metamorphic Core Complex Mode), was localised over pre-existing Proterozoic orogenic belts formed adjacent to major cratonic blocks. Subsequent extensional events in the Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic reactivated these low-angle rift fault systems. However, a series of narrow rift basins (Narrow Rift Mode), bound by high-angle normal faults that cut into the upper mantle, also began forming due to changes in the rheological architecture of the lithosphere following previous extension, crustal thinning and post-rift cooling. Wide rift mode extension, wherein extensional deformation was distributed over broad areas, may have occurred prior to, or in conjunction with, the development of more localised narrow rifts (dual mode rifting) in areas such as the Northern Carnarvon and Browse basins. Extensional deformation progressively localised into the narrow rift basins, which in some cases, matured into seafloor spreading centres during breakup, typically outboard of the major low-angle detachment fault systems. The resulting general structural architecture evolution is consistent with several other hyperextended margins from around the world.\n                  The rift events were punctuated by periods of thermal sag, often in conjunction with pulses of compressional deformation associated with plate-scale tectonic events. Structural restoration of 2D regional seismic lines shows a marked difference in the way the different polyphase rift basin elements responded to shortening. Low-angle detachment faults were relatively well oriented for reactivation under compression, leading to the development of inversion anticlines and associated convergent unconformities towards the inboard basin margin. In contrast, high-angle normal fault systems associated with the pre-existing narrow rift basins were poorly oriented for reactivation during compression and tend to be characterised by minor wrench\/flower structures, generally with relatively limited uplift and erosion on the basin margins. Regional in-plane compressional stresses also worked in combination with vertical loading due to thermal decay to downwarp the lithosphere, forming broad rapidly subsiding synclinal basins above axes of the pre-existing rift basins. The evolving structural architecture developed during the compressional events had significant impacts on the associated sequence stratigraphic architecture.\n               ","55":"\n                  The Bohai Bay Basin, a typical intracontinental rift basin, records East Asia's kinematic plate history during the Cenozoic. The rifting process was driven by the counterclockwise rotation in the direction of the Pacific Plate subduction. From the early Eocene to the Oligocene, the rifting process can be divided into three stages: extension initiation, peak extension, and post-extension. The corresponding rifting rate was calculated based on 40Ar-39Ar data. Then, the provenance area evolution of the above three rifting stages was established by combining the detrital zircon U\u2013Pb data and heavy mineral assemblage data (ZTR, GZi, and ATi). According to the results calculated by 40Ar\/39Ar analysis, the topography of the sink area in the western Bohai bay basin was characterized by moderately rising subsidence rates (100\u00a0m\/Ma) during the extension initiation stage (Paleocene-Early Eocene), when surface drainage was restricted to a limited area with steep channel slopes. During this stage, referring to the core description and seismic interpretation results, the fan delta distributes most of the sediment, most of which migrates from the proximal region. Until the peak extension stage, the source-sink system develops as the rate of subsidence increases (200\u00a0m\/Ma), making the sink area larger, and this period involves multiple types of pathways, including synsedimentary faults and erosional valleys. Sediments from Taihang Massif and Jiaoliao Massif infill the subsidence zone at the distal end. Then, in the post-extension stage, the source-sink systems involve a multi-provenance area (i.e., sourcing from both proximal and distal areas), a large sink area, and a gentle channel gradient due to a decrease in subsidence rate (60\u201380\u00a0m\/Ma). Catchment relief, sediment migration distance, and average fault displacement were used, and these parameters were related to the sediment supply (Qs) for the three rifting stages. We find that during extension initiation and peak extension, the source-to-sink systems show a high amount of sand influx (Qsand\/) and that the ratio Qsand\/Qs total shows a proportional relationship with catchment relief and average fault displacement; this relationship is inversely proportional to the catchment-unit area. Also, according to the types of pathways, we classified the source-to-sink systems during this period into three types, steep eroded pathway (Type-I S2S), gentle slope developed with several boundary faults (Type-II S2S), steep slope with observably eroded valleys or fault-troughs (Type-III S2S). The ratio of Qsand\/Qs is only related to the sediment migration distance and average fault displacement in the post-extension stage. Besides the above three types of source-to-sink systems, we found that multi-stage faults developed along the slope (Type-IV S2S) predominated during this stage.\n               ","56":"\n                  In this paper we present a combined analysis of recent swath bathymetric data, very high-resolution seismic and multi-channel seismic profiles, integrated with a vintage crustal seismic profile, acquired in the NW Sicilian Channel (Central Mediterranean Sea). These data have been analyzed with the main aim of studying the gas presence and related features in both the subsurface and at the seafloor, through the recognition of amplitude and velocity anomalies in the entire Miocene-Pleistocene sedimentary succession. Our results shed light on the possible gas origin and migration mechanisms. In particular, we support the hypothesis of a gas derivation by thermal cracking of organic matter and suggest the shaly\/marly intercalations hosted in the Meso-Cenozoic carbonate succession as a possible source rock. Deep lithospheric faults systems and associated fractures provide preferential paths for gas migration and accumulation in the Miocene-Quaternary sandy and carbonate layers. Gas is then able to locally reach the seafloor originating positive (mud volcanoes) and negative (pockmarks) morphologies.\n               ","57":"\n                  Deep burial carbonate reservoirs (>4000\u00a0m) have great potential of reserves for oil and gas exploration, although the matrix reservoirs generally become extremely heterogeneous and tight due to various diagenesis. Hydrothermal dissolution is supposed to be important for formation of high-quality deep burial carbonate reservoirs. However, few studies have focused on influence of minor fluorine-bearing fluid on carbonate reservoir quality. This study integrates petrography, geochemistry and fluid inclusion data to understand impact of fluorine-bearing fluid on deep burial carbonate reservoirs. Mineralogy and mineral distribution suggest that fluorite and concomitant calcite are found in the Ordovician and Cambrian strata of the whole Tazhong area, especially in the vicinity of faults. Calcite associated with fluorite is probably derived from progressive mixture between formation water and fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluid, which is supported by REY pattern of concomitant calcite, surrounding limestone and fluorite, and fluid inclusion microthermometric data of concomitant calcite and fluorite. Fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluid was responsible for the concomitant C2 calcite of high Y\/Ho ratio. Therefore, the superchondritic Y\/Ho ratio of concomitant calcite can be probably used as proxy for identifying distribution of minor fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluid. For thick fluorite bed, influx of fluorite-rich fluid resulted in surrounding limestone dissolution and altered zones between fluorite and limestone. This process simultaneously improves porosity and permeability of high-energy sedimentary facies reservoirs. In contrast, the fluorine-rich hydrothermal fluid through the low-energy sedimentary facies mainly enhanced permeability of the tight carbonate reservoirs rather than porosity. For widespread tight reservoir of high-energy and low-energy sedimentary facies, even minor fluorite-bearing fluids still enhance permeability. The fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluid may influence carbonate reservoirs away from hydrothermal-altered zones. Significance of minor fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluid for widespread tight carbonates has probably been underestimated for deep burial carbonate reservoir.\n               ","58":"\n                  We present a novel seismic interpretational workflow applied to a large gas-chimney located above the Marjoram Gas Field, offshore NW Borneo. The gas-chimney is hosted by a clay-dominated sealing sequence characterised by meter-scale silt beds. The sealing sequence is affected by a complex network of normal faults. The gas chimney, interpretable as vertical anomaly cluster, is composed of several discrete amplitude anomalies and is the result of gas leakage from the crest of a \u223c500\u00a0m thick carbonate pinnacle-reef below. By analysing the seal properties and the anomalies composing the vertical anomaly cluster we argue that the leakage is consistent with migration of gas either along faults or using faults via cross-fault-plane juxtapositions. We show that this process is focussed within a narrow pathway rather than spread over the fault network. Mode I fault opening in response to the large capillary pressure exerted by the long gas column of the subjacent Marjoram Gas Field is postulated to be the cause of leakage.\n               ","59":"\n                  The Barents Sea has experienced intense erosion throughout the Cenozoic due to uplift and repeated episodes of glaciation. This, in turn, has driven large pressure and temperature fluctuations in the sediment substrate along with rearrangement of thermogenic oil and gas accumulations. As a result, some hydrocarbon fields have relatively shallow depths, and natural gas release is widespread. This study focuses on the process of hydrocarbon leakage from the Realgrunnen reservoir - encompassing the Hanssen and Wisting discoveries - to the shallow subsurface caused by repeated cycles of glacial erosion in the central Barents Sea throughout the Quaternary. We apply 2D basin and petroleum system modeling to two seismic sections using data from two wells and run ten different scenarios that test model sensitivity to key parameters. We find that the primary factors governing gas leakage are the erosion amount, its distribution between glacial and preglacial stages, and the timing of the glaciations. Our results demonstrate that intense oil and gas leakage from the Realgrunnen reservoir occurs primarily through widespread faults activated during the first deglaciation episode. Further considerable gas leakage occurs by the seal breach after a critical overburden thickness is eroded and pressure on the reservoir decreases to ca. 9\u00a0MPa. Modeling reveals that the first deglaciation episode causes up to ca. 20% loss of oil and gas from the reservoir, whereas leakage after the seal breach yields a further ca. 15% decrease in gas. Our results are supported by seismic analyses that demonstrate hydrocarbon leakage in the study area.\n               ","60":"\n                  Based on seismic data, we document the differences in the geological structure and evolution on the two sides of the Hengshui Accommodation Zone (HAZ), identify the timing of faulting on faults, and analyze the mechanism of the HAZ. The northern part of the HAZ is characterized by a half-graben controlled by double detachment faults with opposite dips, and the southern part of the HAZ is characterized by a compound half-graben controlled by a single detachment fault with multiple faults. The structural evolution of the southern Jizhong subbasin can be divided into the following five stages: the basement evolution stage; Rift Episode I (Ek-Es4); Rift Episode II (Es3\u2013Es2); Rift Episode III (Es1-Ed); and the Postrift stage (Nm-Ng). Three segments were identified along the HAZ, namely, the Xinle Anticline (XLA), the Ningjin Segment (NJS) and the Hengshui Transfer Fault (HSTF). The XLA is a transverse anticline produced by the fault section of the Taihang Mountain Piedmont Fault (TMPF). The NJS is a transfer fault formed by the differential extension of the Ningjin Fault. As a major part of the HAZ, there are obvious differences in the faults on both sides of the HSTF, and NE-trending Cenozoic faults were mainly on its north side, while the NNE-trending faults formed in the basement stage were distributed on its south side. During the basement evolution stage, NNE-trending basement faults and the HSTF developed by WNW extension. During Rift Episode \u2160 (Ek-Es4), under the NW extension, NE-trending fault segments formed, and pre-existing faults were reactivated. During Rift Episode \u2161 (Es3\u2013Es2), pre-existing faults were subjected to oblique extension, and the NE-trending fault segments on both sides of the HSTF grew into the main fault and intersected with the HSTF. From Rift Episode III (Es1-Ed) to the present, some pre-existing faults have been reactivated, and many new secondary faults in the basin have finally produced the present structural pattern. These results suggest that the continuous transfer of the regional stress field during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic was the driving force for the formation and evolution of the HAZ.\n               ","61":"\n                  The late Middle Devonian Geneseo Formation and its lateral equivalents in the northern Appalachian Basin are significant secondary targets to the extensively explored Marcellus Sub-group. Surface to sub-surface characterization of the mudstone-dominated Geneseo Formation combines detailed observations of facies, facies associations, stratal architecture, stratal geometry, and stratal terminations, in combination with geochemical proxies to assess proximal to distal trends and enable prediction of hydrocarbon play element quality and distribution. Correlations within this mudstone-rich succession are conducted at the parasequence-scale, and incorporate detailed descriptions of four drill cores, >100 outcrops, and mapping of >500 wireline logs.\n                  The Geneseo Formation herein has been subdivided into two depositional sequences comprising three lithostratigraphic units (i.e., Lower Geneseo, Fir Tree, and Upper Geneseo members respectively). The Lower and Upper Geneseo members show systematic aggradational to progradational parasequence stacking patterns, as well as downlap\u2012onlap stratal terminations with underlying strata; these members represent highstand systems tracts. The Fir Tree Member occurs between the Lower and Upper Geneseo members, truncates the underlying Lower Geneseo, shows progradational\u2012aggradational\u2012retrogradational parasequence stacking patterns, and spans two systems tracts: lowstand and transgressive.\n                  Isopach maps were constructed within the high-resolution sequence-stratigraphic framework to better understand thickness trends at the landing-zone scale. Thickness variation across the basin suggests reactivation of basement structures and syndepositional faulting strongly influenced accommodation. Specifically, the N\u2013S trending Clarendon-Linden Fault System appears to have been a western sediment barrier during Geneseo time and the primary depocenter of fine-grained clastics occurs in south-central NY in a structural low. As the Geneseo system advanced, the succession sequentially filled topographic lows from east to west (proximal to distal). Understanding the controls on reservoir quality and distribution of secondary and tertiary targets to the Marcellus can facilitate ranking and prioritization of landing-zones, as well as optimization of well placement for completion design.\n               ","62":"\n                  Superposed events of rock exposure, fracturing, and the hydrological dynamics, are key elements that influence epigenic karstification in carbonate reservoirs. However, they are not fully identified in seismic or well data. One way forward is a multiscale characterization of the porous system to understand karst development, from the pore scale to large caves, confined to high-permeability layers that can reach the basin scale. The present study investigates superposed meteoric dissolution events in carbonate rocks by combining the analyses of depositional setting, diagenesis, stratigraphic architecture, tectonics, and hydrological zones. We performed analyses of 130 plugs collected in 11 outcrops using petrographic, petrophysical, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses. The study area is the Cretaceous Janda\u00edra Formation in the Potiguar Basin, Brazil, where we identified a regional subaerial unconformity-SU (sequence boundary-1). This surface is characterized by a change in facies and depositional system between dolomitic peritidal deposits (depositional sequence 1) and tight-cemented calcite subtidal deposits (depositional sequence 2). A concentration of caves occurs below the SU. We conclude that subaerial unconformities (vadose surfaces) can develop better reservoir qualities with superposed freshwater leaching and karstification. They control the lateral reservoir zonation, whereas faults and fractures provide vertical pore distribution within the vadose\/phreatic hydrological zones. Water table fluctuations can develop multilevel caves and conduits along the epiphreatic zones, increasing the reservoir thickness, which reaches 50\u2013100\u00a0m in the Potiguar Basin. We recognized two previous subaerial unconformities at the basin scale using well and seismic data. These findings may have important implications for assessing reservoir location and quality in large areas.\n               ","63":"\n                  We have used a hovercraft platform drifting with the sea ice to acquire the first digitally recorded seismic reflection data transects across the Canada\/Greenland (89\u00b0N-85\u00b0N) section of the Lomonosov Ridge, central Arctic Ocean. The flat-lying, laterally uniform Cenozoic sediment package on top of the ridge at 87\u00b0N, 60\u00b0 W shows at least four sites with local seismic amplitude anomalies. The common feature is a column (<600\u00a0m wide) of partly discontinuous or chaotic bright reflection events at the center of a <1.5\u00a0km wide dome (amplitude <25\u00a0m) terminating at the seabed in a 8\u201312\u00a0m deep depression. The amplitude anomalies are interpreted as gas-charged fluid escape pipes marked by a pockmark at the seabed. Gas and fluids introduced from below have mobilized the overlying high porosity, low density Eocene bio-siliceous ooze causing the doming. The gas and fluids appear to originate from the top of rotated fault blocks and sub-basalt sediments of Mesozoic or older age deposited when the Lomonosov Ridge was part of the pre-Late Cretaceous continental margin north of Franz Josef Land.\n               ","64":"\n                  The Sylhet Trough of the Bengal Basin in the northeastern Indian Plate had started to develop since the Late Mesozoic Gondwana break-up and subsequent onset of the Cenozoic Himalayan Orogeny. However, very little is known about evolution of the Cenozoic Sylhet Trough in response to the latter tectonic event. Therefore, we aim at providing insights into the nature of basement, variations in structural style, kinematics and possible timing of structural activation(s) and tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Sylhet Trough based on geophysical data interpretation. Results show that the Sylhet Trough is mostly underlain by an attenuated continental or oceanic crust, bounded by a NE-SW-trending geophysical feature in the northwest that corresponds to the boundary with the Precambrian continental crust. The overlying Cenozoic sediments show variations in style of deformations and can be divided into three structural domains. Domains 1 and 2 in the southeastern and northeastern parts of the Sylhet Trough, respectively, are characterized by anticlines that are highly deformed to the east and are mostly associated with west- or northwest-dipping reverse faults. However, the anticlinal trends are deviated from a generalized NS-orientation in the Domain 1 to a dominant NE-SW-orientation in the Domain 2. Many of these anticlines resemble positive flower structures, indicating possible impacts of regional transpression associated with the Dauki and Kaladan faults to the north and east; respectively. In contrast, the Domain 3 to the west shows NE-SW-trending extensional structures. A southward thickening of the Oligocene to Miocene pre-kinematic packages indicates an early episode of foreland basin subsidence, although there is no evidence of a major structural activation. Rather, the presence of the Pliocene syn-kinematic packages indicates a major structural reactivation in response to the E-W and N-S crustal shortening since the Pliocene. This younger episode of structural activation can be directly linked with the late Cenozoic subduction related processes of the Indian Plate to the north and to the east, which is also responsible for the transformation of the Sylhet Trough into a remnant ocean basin. This latter (i.e., Pliocene and onward) episode of crustal shortening played a significant role in structural trap formation and preservation of hydrocarbons in the Sylhet Trough.\n               ","65":"\n                  The Tuofutai Bulge in central Tabei of northern Tarim Basin provides insights into the complex geochemical processes of deep oil accumulations. Fifteen crude oil samples collected from deep Ordovician reservoirs were tested and analyzed with light hydrocarbons (LHs) and diamondoids to evaluate the oil family, secondary alteration, and mixing processes. Results show that the oil samples share similar distribution characteristics of LHs and diamondoids and contain low concentrations of methyldiamantanes, suggesting that they belong to one group and have not been significantly altered by thermal cracking. Geochemistry of LHs and diamondoids indicate that the thermochemical sulfate reduction is limited and negligible, whereas some samples are severely altered by biodegradation. The phase fractionation is mainly related to the leakage of light hydrocarbon caused by geological activities such as tectonic uplift and fault activity, and some samples show weak evaporative fractionation. The biodegradation causes the increase in the values of methyladamantane to adamantane (MAs\/A) and the concentrations of (1\u00a0+\u00a02)-methyladamantane and (3\u00a0+\u00a04)-methyldiamantane. The thermal maturity of oil calculated on the basis of LHs and diamondoids is generally higher than that calculated using saturated and aromatic fractions. The difference of various maturity parameters related to saturated hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, LHs and diamondoids records multiple oil charging and mixing processes.\n               ","66":"\n                  The fault-bend fold, a typical structure in foreland thrust belts, is suitable for hydrocarbon accumulation. Natural fractures are ubiquitously developed and usually interlaced to form a complex network in fault-bend folds, which can play a fundamental role in hydrocarbon migration and enrichment. This study utilized outcrops and the discrete element method (DEM) to simulate and analyze the characteristics, distribution patterns, and development mechanisms of natural fractures in the fault-bend fold. The study anticline, located in the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, is a well exposed fault-bend fold. Statistical results of dips and dip direction of fracture in different structural positions show that the fold-related fractures strike NWW-SEE parallel to the axis of the study fold. The fractures include layer-parallel shortening related fractures (LPSF), interlayer slipping related fractures (ILSF), active hinge parallel shearing related fractures (AHSF), and curvature-related fractures (CF). The LPSF and ILSF are strata-bound fractures, whereas the CF and AHSF are not strictly confined in layers. Furthermore, results of the DEM and outcrop measurements demonstrate that LPSF are formed at the embryonic stage. ILSF and AHSF are formed in the early stage, and the mid-late stage is the main formation period of CF. By integrating strata deformation history with fracture types and development characteristics, a development pattern of fractures within the fault-bend fold has been established, and five deformation panels are developed (panels I\u2013V). From panels I to V, the fracture area density increases consecutively, and panel I (unfolded) is limited to regional fractures. Next, LPSF and ILSF are more highly developed in panel V (forelimb) than in panels IV (strongly folded layers of the backlimb), III (core), and II (weakly folded layers of the backlimb). Moreover, CF are predominantly found in panel III, and AHSF are mostly developed in panel IV.

We use high-resolution 2D and 3D seismic and well data to discuss the influence of different types of pre-existing faults on the evolution of fault networks and basins. The pre-existing faults began to move in the Mesozoic times. In the Cenozoic, the Chengbei fault reactivated, but the Wuhaozhuang fault did not. The Chengbei fault developed \u201czigzag\u201d plane-view geometries and controlled the sedimentary characteristics of the Chengbei sag. In this area, the near-EW-striking faults developed perpendicular to the Cenozoic regional stress direction. The Wuhaozhuang fault did not reactivate and was cut by NNE-striking faults, which controlled the Cenozoic sedimentation. Based on the above mentioned observations, we discuss the factors that influence the reactivation of pre-existing faults, including their geometric characteristics (fault strike and dip), the influence of regional stress, and the heterogeneity of basement rocks. These observations demonstrate the influence of pre-existing faults and regional stress on the later normal faults development and basin evolution.\n               ","69":"\n                  This article describes the results of a comprehensive analysis of the causes of intensive gas emission over a large zone (ca. 80\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220\u00a0km) of the Central Laptev shelf area. The upper parts of 28 sections of common depth point (CDP) seismic lines acquired by the JSC MAGE, covering a total length of 5930\u00a0km over an area of 55,000\u00a0km2, were interpreted and 519 anomalous objects potentially connected with gas saturation were revealed. For the first time, the boundary between frozen and thawed sediments was defined in the Laptev Sea. The absence of subsea permafrost and gas hydrates in the intensive gas seepage zone was determined. The connection between gas seeps and deep-seated faults identified in seismic sections was substantiated. This study demonstrated that seismotectonic factors caused a large spatial window of long-term Earth degassing with direct intensive migration of deep thermogenic gas to the hydrosphere through a system of faults. A zone of potential gas hydrate distribution was observed on the continental slope.\n               ","70":"\n                  Thin-skinned extension detached on salt is mostly well understood. Faults may dip basinward or landward (counterregional) and intersect the top salt or equivalent weld at cusps\/rollers. The polarity of faulting may switch over time, and with sufficient extension, the oldest suprasalt strata separate into rafts with intervening younger depocenters. Salt may break through extensionally thinned overburden to grow as passive diapirs, which can widen during ongoing extension but collapse if the salt supply cannot keep pace with extension. Counterregional normal faults are the most debated structures as they may form by: extension, with the footwall moving basinward relative to the hanging wall; or progressive basinward salt expulsion but only vertical movement of the overburden. Extensional counterregional structures are characterized by: (i) strata that predominantly thicken into the bounding structures, but with areas of basinward thinning due to fault\/salt geometry and displacement transfer; (ii) highly elongate plan-view geometries; and (iii) the presence of coeval distal translation and contraction. The most controversial counterregional system is the Albian Gap of the Santos Basin, Brazil. We use the criteria above to argue that it formed by post-Albian thin-skinned extension, with little\/no extension during the Albian. This contrasts with the Campos Basin along strike to the NE, where Albian and later extension were accommodated on basinward-dipping faults, and is explained by the rift architecture and consequent base-salt dip. The Aptian salt dipped basinward in the Campos Basin and extension was therefore triggered by Albian gravity gliding. However, the base salt dipped landward over a large area of the northern and central Santos Basin, so that Albian gravity gliding was minimal and Late Cretaceous progradational loading drove gravity spreading and the development of the counterregional system. Accommodation for sediment within the Albian Gap was provided in part by stretching and consequent thinning of the underlying salt.\n               ","71":"\n                  Overpressure in sedimentary basins has practical commercial importance for petroleum exploration as the steady maintenance of pore-pressure in reservoirs is important for CO2 sequestration. Traps associated with faults comprise >30% of hydrocarbon discoveries in the Dongying depression, Bohai Bay Basin. However, the way structural inheritance, together with fault reactivation and its development, influence pore-pressure development and overpressure preservation remain poorly understood. This research uses high-resolution 3D seismic data combined with well-log data to investigate the structural evolution in the Lijin and Boxing sags in the Dongying depression and elucidate the influence of structural inheritance on overpressure development. The interpreted data reveal that: 1) five fault families in the Lijin Sag influence overpressure development, 2) three phases of faulting occurred in the Boxing Sag, with fault reactivation predominating in the early Eocene and late Oligocene; and 3) pressure coefficients (Pc) in Eocene strata vary from 0.90 to 1.96 in the Lijin and Boxing sags. In the Boxing Sag, Pc values vary from 0.91 to 1.54 in the Eocene strata, with 99% of overpressure coefficients below 1.50. In comparison, pressure coefficients in the Lijin Sag are significantly higher than in the Boxing Sag, with Pc values varying from 0.9 to 1.96, and 30% of the Pc values are over 1.50. This study concludes that inherited structures significantly control the development of overpressure in sedimentary basins. Systematic fault reactivation often leads to fluid leakage, which has a negative influence on overpressure preservation. In basins with border faults controlling their evolution, high-magnitude overpressure tends to be generated and maintained, favoring the formation of pressure compartments, conditions less ideal for carbon sequestration.\n               ","72":"\n                  The Carboniferous compressional deformation of the Arabian Plate has been causally linked with the Hercynian orogeny. However, this epeirogenic movement occurred far from the Arabian plate. Instead, the Gondwana-directed subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust may be the controlling factor of the Carboniferous structural development of southeast Turkey (the northern Arabian Plate). The tectonic activity resulted in uplift and widespread erosion of a large area and produced granitic intrusions, metamorphism, folding, and faulting. The compressional event was intermitted by theback-arc spreading of the Neo-Tethys Ocean (Middle Permian-Triassic) that occurred because of the detachment of the Cimmerian supercontinent from the Gondwana margin. The spreading of the Neo-Tethys caused the Arabian Plate to be subjected to extensional tectonism. The tectonic overprints of these epeirogenic events on the structural fabric of southeast Turkey have not been studied in detail. Innovations in subsurface imaging techniques, wireline logs, and sufficient-quality data enable the depiction of the traces of the Carboniferous compression and the subsequent Permian\u2013Triassic regional extension. This study explores the structural remnants of the Carboniferous compression and the Permian\u2013Triassic extension in southeast Turkey and their impact on the Paleozoic petroleum system. In conclusion, the Carboniferous, SW- and EW-oriented compressional forces led to major uplift, inversion, and substantive erosion in southeast Turkey. The regional uplift confined the Silurian-sourced oil exploration activities to a narrower area due to the denudation of the Silurian units towards the Carboniferous Arches. Subsequently, the opening of the Neo-Tethys yielded en-echelon NW and WNW-trending horsts and grabens bounded on both sides by normal faults, resulting in the northeastward thickening of the syn-rift units. The horst structures allow hydrocarbon accumulation in the Ordovician Bedinan Formation sandstones tectonically juxtaposed with the Silurian source rock.\n               ","73":"\n                  As petroleum industry tilts towards unconventional petroleum resources, the significance of fractures in exploration and development becomes increasingly prominent. In this study, thin sections and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation, porosity and permeability measurement, mercury injection porosimeter (MIP) and computerized tomography (CT) analysis were carried out to investigate the morphology and development characteristics of intragranular fractures, and their effects on physical properties, reservoir diagenesis, and gas migration of the He-1 Member tight sandstones in the Hangjinqi area. Results show that the tight sandstones have intergranular and intragranular dissolved pores, intercrystalline pores and heterogeneous distributed intragranular fractures. The average porosity and permeability of the tight sandstones with intragranular fractures are 12.76% and 4.70\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0\u03bcm2, while those lack of fractures are 6.06% and 0.574\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0\u03bcm2, respectively. The fracture density increases with the enlargement of clastic-grain size and the content of rigid grains. Results indicate that the intragranular fractures greatly enhance permeability, but they have limited direct contribution to total porosity. And the sandstones rich in intragranular fractures have a more homogeneous and connective pore structure with larger radius of pore throat. Intragranular fractures are beneficial to the latter feldspar and debris dissolution caused by organic acids derived from hydrocarbon generation in coal-bearing strata. The dissolved pores directly enhance the porosity of tight sandstones compared to intragranular fractures, and together they form a percolation network to increase permeability. Faults mainly control the lateral petroleum migration from the south to the north, and intragranular fractures affect the local accumulation of gas. This study helps to illustrate the influences of intragranular fractures on reservoir properties, diagenetic difference, and gas migration of the He-1 Member tight sandstones in the Hangjinqi area, and can guide the evaluation and exploration of tight sandstone reservoirs in the Ordos Basin and other basins with similar settings around the world.\n               ","74":"\n                  The deeply buried Ordovician Lianglitage Formation (>6500\u00a0m) in the Halahatang area, Tarim Basin, is characterized by a paleokarst topography and subsurface, collapsed paleokarstsystems. Based on core and thin-section observation and wireline-log interpretation, this study analyzed basic features of collapsed karst systems and mapped the pattern of collapsed and original karst systems through root mean square (RMS) amplitude and variance attribute fusion. Employment of production data revealed the general rule of these ultra-deep, buried, collapsed systems as reservoirs for oil and gas. This study showed that epigenic subsurface karst systems in the Lianglitage Formation experienced full collapse, filling, and subsequent strong compaction. Passages of subsurface karst systems have a dendritic pattern These ultra-deep and strongly compacted collapsed systems are not favorable for oil and gas production owing to poor reservoir qualities. Factors controlling original subsurface karst development in this area are extensive subaerial exposure during the Falling-Stage Systems Tract (FSST) and Lowstand Systems Tract (LST) periods following deposition of the Lianglitage Formation, faults and fractures formed before or during karstification, and surface drainage systems on top of the Lianglitage unconformity. This study provides a method to comprehensively characterize the features, distribution and mechanism of the ultra-deep buried epigenic karst reservoirs and clarified their low potential as reservoirs for oil\/gas exploration and development. It also helps clarify that the true oil pay reservoirs in this reservoir resulted from hypogene dissolution rather than epigenic karst.\n               ","75":"\n                  Ordovician fractured carbonates under study are over 7000\u00a0m deep in northwest China. Multistage tectonic activities result in numerous fractures along the strike-slip faults, accompanied with karst collapses due to atmospheric freshwater seepage. The resultant cave-fracture system provides numerous channels favorable for the migration and storage of hydrocarbons. Azimuthal anisotropy analyses with wide-azimuth and high-density 3D seismic data facilitate fracture estimation from migrated CRP gathers in this area. Compared with azimuthal velocity variations, azimuthal amplitude variations are quite sensitive to fractures, but suffer many negative factors. Major difficulties with azimuthal amplitudes to map superdeep fractured reservoirs include non-uniform distribution of azimuths and offsets, extremely low S\/N ratio (SNR), anisotropic effect of strike-slip faults, and shielding effect of overlying irregular igneous strata. We propose an integrated scheme with azimuthal P\u2013P amplitude\/frequency attributes for prestack prediction of fractures based on the migrated CRP gathers. First, we analyze the distribution of azimuths, offsets, and bins to identify appropriate bins with the best range of offsets and the uniform distribution of azimuths. The selected wide-azimuthal CMP gathers are regrouped in terms of five azimuths, followed by azimuthal prestack migration. The resulting subazimuthal CRP gathers are optimized by denoising, flattening by residual static correction, and wavelet shaping to improve both SNR and resolution. We then conduct a local stacking in 100\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m bin for the best range of offsets from 1000 to 5600\u00a0m, followed by matched filtering to remove the footprint effect of overlying igneous strata. Frequency-related amplitude attributes are extracted for sensitive analyses in azimuths by ellipse fitting, yielding several optimal attributes for fracture prediction. We demonstrate that the coupled amplitude and frequency attributes in terms of energy percentages are the best in this area. Case studies show the applicability of the presented scheme for detecting superdeep fracture sets from extremely low SNR seismic data.\n               ","76":"\n                  Submarine canyons are major conduits for sediment transfer from continental shelf to deep marine environments. Mass failures and faults play a key role in the initiation and evolution of submarine canyons along convergent tectonic margins, in addition to continental sediment supply. Here we analyze high-resolution bathymetry and seismic data from the Colombian southern Caribbean to investigate the controls on submarine canyon morphology along a convergent tectonic margin. We propose three end-member types of canyons: Type I canyons have a direct connection to a major river associated with high sediment supply. These canyons are highly erosive and cut topographic barriers created by tectonic deformation. Type II canyons are associated with faults at the canyon's head, where the location, orientation, and sinuosity are controlled by fault strike. Also, the presence of faults is related to an increase in the occurrence of mass failures from the steep canyon borders, increasing the depth and width asymmetry. Finally, Type III canyons evolve toward the continental shelf edge through retrogressive mass failures. These mass failures produce erosional scars that merge downslope to create submarine canyons in early stages of development, which later evolve to wider but shallow canyons due to the progressive basinward merging. We argue that the morphology of each canyon type is controlled by the interaction between continental sediment supply, mass failures, shelf width, and fault occurrence. We also demonstrate that seafloor topography influences the size of submarine fan deposits at the mouths of canyons. We identified large fan deposits (>650\u00a0km2) on the continental rise, whereas in piggyback sub-basins we found smaller fans (<60\u00a0km2). Our analysis of downdip canyon morphology and associated deposits can be used to predict the development of submarine canyons and associated fans in convergent tectonic margins worldwide.\n               ","77":"\n                  A cored section (North Jens-1) in the Danish Central Graben spans the \u2018Base Cretaceous Unconformity\u2019 (BCU) in a seismically conformable situation in a basin-centre setting. Multidisciplinary analysis of the core revealed that the apparent simplicity of the boundary in seismic profiles at this location disguises a complex, dynamic geological history. Dark, organic-rich, laminated hemipelagic\/turbiditic Farsund Formation mudstones of late Ryazanian (Surites stenomphalus Zone) age are overlain by a thick slump sheet of upper Ryazanian mudstones, probably derived from relict rift-fault scarps on the basin floor. An erosionally-based gravity-flow bed (a hybrid density-flow deposit) of latest Ryazanian (Peregrinoceras albidum Zone) age forms the lowermost unit of the Valhall Formation. The lower boundary of this bed may record a minor hiatus across the stenomphalus\u2013albidum zonal boundary and represents the BCU, compatible with seismic and log data. The hybrid bed is capped by an intensely burrowed omission surface that represents the first clear indication in this basin-centre location of watermass overturn and the demise of the stratified, poorly oxygenated basin. The biostratigraphy, ichnofabric and fauna\/flora of the succeeding bioturbated marlstones and marly chalks of the lower Valhall Formation (Platylenticeras\/Paratollia Zone) testify to increasingly oxygenated bottom waters and low sedimentation rates in a well-mixed, open marine, oligotrophic system; palynological data indicate that the onset of these conditions was linked to transgression. The North Jens-1 core illustrates the risk of assuming stratigraphic simplicity at the BCU surface in basin-centre, seismically conformable settings. Sedimentary reworking, already characteristic of the Farsund Formation setting, was probably exacerbated by transgressive erosion and accompanying sediment de-stabilization along the graben flanks.\n               ","78":"\n                  A detailed tectono-stratigraphic analysis of the Mesozoic through Present-day structures and sedimentary sequences has been carried-out on a very large merged 3-D seismic survey that covers the great part of the central Exmouth Plateau, northern Carnarvon Basin, NW Shelf of Australia. Four main megasequences bounded by regional unconformities have been delineated. They are; (1) Megasequence-I - Early-Late Triassic pre-extension, (2) Megasequence-II - Latest Triassic (Rhaetian)-earliest Late Jurassic (Oxfordian) syn-extension; (3) Megasequence-III - Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous post-extension; and (4) Megasequence-IV - Early Cretaceous-Present-day passive margin strata. Three populations of extensional faults and a previously unrecognised compressional phase of folding have been identified. The main Mesozoic (Rhaetian-Oxfordian) WNW-directed extension produced domino-style planar extensional faults (Fault System 1) with two principle fault sets; (i) large N\u2013S to NNE-SSW-trending, west-dipping faults and (ii) smaller-scale, largely antithetic east-dipping faults. The large faults are possibly reactivated pre-existing deeper and older faults (possibly related to listric growth faults of the large Lower-to Mid-Triassic Mungaroo delta) as well as completely new faults developed in the upper part of the Triassic Mungaroo Formation. Synclinal hangingwall basins of this system are strongly segmented and underfilled with little (<450\u00a0m) syn-extensional sedimentation.\n                  Fault System 1 was reactivated during the Early Cretaceous-Neogene post-extension stage and strongly influenced the development of the segmented NNE-SSW-trending Fault System 2 in the Cenozoic strata. Two stacked polygonal non-tectonic fault tiers (Fault System 3) separated by little deformed stratigraphy occur within the Berriasian to Pliocene post-extension sequences. In the early post-extension phase, Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous NNE-SSW-directed minor contraction event produced broad WNW-ESE-striking folds in the Triassic-Early Cretaceous strata. This study documents the development of the extensional fault systems and proposes new 4-D tectono-stratigraphic evolutionary models for the central Exmouth Plateau.

However, the main hydrocarbon sources of the gas hydrates remain controversial. The main hypotheses include a shallowly buried microbial gas source or a deeply buried thermogenic hydrocarbon source. In this study, an integrated geochemical-microbial-geological analysis of gas hydrate and sediment samples from sites SC1 and SC2 in the Shenhu area was conducted to investigate the possible hydrocarbon sources, and to identify the signatures of the secondary microbial gases in the gas hydrate reservoirs. The results show that the gas hydrates from sites SC1 and SC2 exhibit the geochemical characteristics of secondary microbial gas (C1\/(C2+C3) >100, \u221250.2\u2030<\u03b413C\u2013C1<\u221247.4\u2030), and the propane (C3) component and liquid thermogenic hydrocarbons (C15+) have been severely biodegraded (a strongly elevated \u03b413C\u2013C3 value and a high abundance of 25-norhopanes). In addition, we discovered that the in-situ Quaternary marine sediments exhibit relatively low generation potential of primary microbial gas because of the extremely low organic matter richness (total organic matter content (TOC)\u00a0<\u00a00.3%) and low in-situ temperatures (5\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C). Furthermore, a relatively high abundance of methanogens (\u223c7%\u201315%) were detected within the gas hydrate reservoir, which may be attributed to the methane generation process of hydrocarbon biodegradation. Moreover, the geological-geophysical interpretations indicate that the distributions of the gas hydrate accumulations and the shallow gas pools are strictly controlled by the effective faults connecting them with the deeply buried thermogenic source rocks. These lines of evidence suggest a significant contribution of secondary microbial methane to sites SC1 and SC2, which further indicates that the main contribution was from deeply buried thermogenic hydrocarbon sources. Our results suggest that the secondary microbial methane within gas hydrates is an important terminal product that has been converted from thermogenic hydrocarbons via microbial degradation, which helps explain why the geochemistry of most of the hydrate-bound gas indicates a microbial origin even though the geological evidence indicates that the gas is mainly sourced from deeply buried thermogenic hydrocarbons.\n               ","80":"\n                  Understanding the development of syn-rift carbonate systems is complex, and their facies distributions can sometimes be difficult to predict due to the combination of key factors such as tectonics, eustasy, palaeogeography and climate.\n                  This research presents an integrated study using 3D seismic, well logs and core data from SE Dahra Platform, in order to investigate the control of synsedimentary faults on reservoir architecture and predict heterogeneous distributions of carbonate facies of the Cenomanian (Lidam) Formation, due to its importance as an oil reservoir in the Sirt Basin.\n                  The interpretation of seismic data indicates the presence of two short-lived extensional fault systems, the NNE-SSW trending Dor Fault, and the NNW-SSE trending Bualawn Fault.

These results indicate that local tectonic deformations and sea-level changes were the primary controls on platform geometry and facies distributions. Additionally, in this study, the Lidam reservoir was divided into two layers (Layer 1 and Layer 2) separated by a thin layer of shale.

This work integrates seismic, well logs and conventional core dataset in order to define the syn-rift sedimentary patterns and their impact on distribution and quality of the reservoir facies. Khatatba Formation comprises two discrete units; the lower unit constitutes lower progradational and upper retrogradational sedimentary packages that are interpreted in terms of discrete rift phases. Nine sedimentary facies associations (FA) were recognized and their stacking patterns are governed by the rift evolution and the interplay between variation in fault offsets and sediment supply. Distal sand bar sandstones, marine shales and organic-rich shales were accumulated during periods of high subsidence. Successive alternation between shallow and deep facies at the base of the lower unit reveals repeated short periods of progradation and retrogradation with an overall progradational trend reflecting an elevated rate of sediment supply.\n                  Episodic fault-controlled retrogradation and progradation continued during the deposition of the Khatatba upper unit where the progradational deltaic facies changes upward into retrogradational marine sediments and aggradational-progradational aeolian and shoreface sandstones. Five hydraulic flow units (HFUs) were identified and their distribution is mostly controlled by the rift evolution. The lowest reservoir quality HFU4 and HFU5 are often associated with the retrograding distal facies accumulated during highest rates of subsidence. These zones do not contribute to more than 10% of the reservoir flow capacity.

We identified the reason for the difference in lacustrine rift basins. Geological and geophysical data, including drilling data, well logging curves, and high-quality full-coverage 3D seismic volume survey data, were used to interpret and analyse the sedimentary system types and their spatial and temporal distribution. The filling evolution of the Baxian sag in the Palaeogene comprised three episodes and had stages where filling occurred.

The entire rifting process could be separated into several multi-episodic sub-processes, with each sub-process undergoing four stages, i.e., initial rifting, strong rifting, stable rifting, and post-fault return. Further, the formation and evolution of faults, particularly boundary faults, control the stratigraphic structure and distribution of sedimentary systems in rift lacustrine basins. Differences in the category and distribution of the sedimentary system illustrate the relationship between fault activity intensity and provenance supply in such basins. Near-source sediments were deposited rapidly in the early stage; subsequently, the basin deepened rapidly. The deep-water deposits and far-source deposits were laid down slowly in the middle and late stages, respectively. Differential activities of boundary faults, influenced by mantle differential convection, controlled the formation and development of rift lacustrine deposits and the differential evolution of the basin.

Within fold-and thrust belts, faults and folds have fundamental roles in controlling hydrocarbon migration, entrapment, and\/or leakage. Past studies have mainly focused on the role of syn-orogenic thrusts, tear faults, and folds in controlling hydrocarbon migration and entrapment. On the contrary, little attention has been dedicated to the role of normal faults in hydrocarbon remobilization during the post-orogenic extension. We combine field and subsurface data with geological evidence from the Ripi oil field, central Apennines (Italy), and propose a conceptual model for hydrocarbon remobilization along post-orogenic normal faults and potential entrapment within shallow reservoirs. Results show that post-orogenic normal faults promoted up-dip hydrocarbon remobilization from oil traps generated during fold-and-thrust belt development. Where pre-orogenic deposits are still covered by syn-orogenic deposits, hydrocarbons moved up-dip along post-orogenic normal faults and impregnated high-porosity sandstone lenses, generating discontinuous and heavy oil reservoirs. On the contrary, where syn-orogenic deposits were eroded in response to orogenic uplift, hydrocarbons leaked at the Earth's surface. Results from this study can be applied to reduce risks during hydrocarbon exploration and appraisal in similar tectonic settings, such as Hellenides and Carpathian fold-and-thrust belts, as well as the southern Apennines of Italy, where the Tempa Rossa and Monte Alpi oil fields, two of the largest onshore oil fields in Western Europe, were discovered in the last decades.\n               ","85":"\n                  The South China Sea (SCS) is a marginal basin characterized by propagating breakup and subsequent seafloor spreading during the Cenozoic.

This system is characterized by wide margins showing a succession of rift basins with thinned continental crust, associated with large extensional detachment faults soling on top of the lower crust.

Relative impedance (\u221290\u00b0 data) and frequency fusion are applied to predict impedance and lithology in carbonate platform-basin architecture. Outcrop seismic modeling clarifies the facies architecture of subtle subseismic clinoforms. Stratal slices are made for seismic geomorphology. We recognized eight seismic sequences and seven seismic facies in 1200-m prograding sediments. As a strongly prograding accretionary margin, the stratal relationships and transitions from platform interior to shelf margin to slope and basin are consistent throughout the basin. Platform interior is characterized by intertidal, supratidal, and salt flat facies; the shelf margin develops microbial reef and shoal facies; the slope and basin facies are dominantly gravity flow and deepwater sediments. The northern and southern areas of the margin, however, are characterized by different slope-to-basin geomorphology and environments. In the north, the shelf edge was cemented, with little reworking of shallow-water sediments to the slope and basin. Gravity failure\u2013related facies, such as gullies and slump aprons, dominate in the slope. No turbidite fans are found in the sediment-starved deep basin. In the south, a series of submarine channels transported shallow sediments long distance to form slope fans and basin-floor fans. Turbidite sediments contain a significant amount of low-impedance sediments from the shelf edge. The syndepositional tectonic trench faults, by initiating channels, are hypothesized to be a new mechanism for sediment transport in a deepwater environment. Such a mechanism provides a clue to help researchers recognize and map deepwater reservoir facies in the basin.\n               ","87":"\n                  There is ongoing debate on whether stylolites act as barriers, conduits, or play no role in fluid transport. This problem can be tackled by examining the spatial and temporal relationships between stylolites and other diagenetic products at multiple scales. Using the well-known Lower Cretaceous Benic\u00e0ssim case study area (Maestrat Basin, E. Spain), we provide new field and petrographic observations of how bedding-parallel stylolites can influence different diagenetic processes during basin evolution. The results reveal that stylolites can serve as baffles or inhibitors for different carbonate diagenetic reactions, and act as fronts for dolomitization, dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization processes. Anastomosing stylolites that pre-date burial dolomitization probably acted as a collective baffle for dolomitization fluids in the study area, resulting in stratabound replacement geometries at the metre-to-kilometre scale. The dolomitization front coincides with stylolites, and can be traced along consecutive anastomosing ones. Such anastomosing stylolites are typical of mud-dominated facies that characterize limestone-dolostone transition zones. Conversely, dolostone bodies tend to correspond to more grain-dominated facies characterized by parallel (non-anastomosing) stylolites. Stylolites subsequently acted as fluid flow conduits and barriers when the burial and stress conditions changed. Stylolitic porosity enhanced by dissolution within dolostones close to faults appears filled with saddle dolomite riming the stylolite pore, and high-temperature blocky calcite cements filling the remaining porosity. The fluids responsible for these reactions were likely released from below at high pressure, causing hydraulic brecciation, and were channelised through stylolites, which acted as fluid conduits. Stylolites are also found acting as baffles for subsequent dolomite calcitization reactions during meteoric diagenesis and occasionally appear filled with iron oxides likely released by calcitization. This example demonstrates how the same type of stylolites (bedding-parallel) can act as barriers\/inhibitors and\/or conduits for different types of diagenetic reactions through time, and how important it is to consider their collective role when they form networks.\n               ","88":"\n                  Multichannel seismic and hydroacoustic data from the Maldives carbonate platform in the northern Indian Ocean document 4\u20138\u00a0km wide and are 70\u2013170\u00a0m thick submarine landslides at water depths greater than 500\u00a0m, potentially associated with extensive fluid escape and the occurrence of gas hydrates. The mobilized sediments are part of giant drift bodies that consist of fine-grained carbonate ooze. Their downslope extent is located adjacent to large gateways that connect the semi-enclosed inner basin of the carbonate platform with the open Indian Ocean. Exposed at the sea-floor are headwall and translational domain of the landslides, showing different kinematic indicators typical for mass transport complexes. The submarine landslides evolved at slightly inclined slopes (<1\u00b0) along a listric basal shear surface (BSS) by downslope progradation and retrogressive failure. Styles of motion include sediment creeping, sliding and slumping. Where the BSS is flat, sediments translate as a large body. Where the BSS is irregular, folded, thrusted and rotated blocks\/ridges occur, associated with secondary listric shear faults. Characteristically for the headwall domain are arcuate depressions which are related to rollover structures in the displaced slide block. The distal toe domain of the submarine landslides is located at the steep (>20\u00b0) part of the platform slope which faces the Indian Ocean. Data show that landslide activity is ongoing.\n                  The likely trigger of slope failure is a combination of gravitational forces and the reduction of sediment shear strength moderated by fluid ascent and the destabilization of gas hydrates. Gas hydrates are suggested to play an important rule, because the top of the gas hydrate stability zone coincides with a significant steepening of the platform slope from 1-3\u00b0 to 10\u201320\u00b0. It is therefore proposed that the dissociation of the gas hydrates, for example during sealevel lowstands might have been an additional trigger of slope failure. During sealevel highstands, gas-hydrate coating of sediment grains may facilitate low-velocity plastic deformation of the strata.\n               ","89":"\n                  Calcite microcrystals and associated microporosity are ubiquitous and extensively developed in Jurassic and Cretaceous carbonate sequences in the Middle East. Clumped isotope analyses of calcite microcrystals in the Lower Cretaceous Thamama-B strata in UAE reservoirs indicate temperatures of 60\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C and burial of 1.5\u20132.5\u00a0km suggesting formation synchronous with and updip of Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction at the Eastern Arabian continental margin. Assuming that recrystallization of precursor calcite to calcite microcrystals requires initially undersaturation to drive dissolution\/re-precipitation a basin-scale 2D reactive transport model (RTM) was constructed. The model is constrained by hydro-mechanical simulations and used to quantitatively evaluate the hypothesis that the formation of calcite microcrystals and associated microporosity is driven by expulsion of compaction fluids during rapid burial.\n                  The combined influence of fluid flux and cooling results in trace net calcite dissolution (porosity increase <0.1\u00a0vol %) focused at depths of 2.7\u20135.1\u00a0km. The presence of even minor amounts of minerals with common ions (dolomite and anhydrite) induces additional dissolution but does not change its\u2019 spatial distribution. Whilst RTMs only yield a minimum estimate of the degree of recrystallization that likely occurs driven by calcite disequilibrium, simulations suggest these reactions occur at temperatures of 95\u2013170\u00a0\u00b0C, markedly higher than those estimated from clumped isotopes of the calcite microcrystals. Mixing of fluids leaked from underlying strata up faults into the lateral flow system could play an important role in burial diagenesis, with the slow leakage dissolving up to ten times greater mass of calcite than a shorter pulse of equivalent fluid volume. A previously unrecognized effect of the introduction of H2S(aq)-rich fluids, derived from accelerated thermal maturation or thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR), into formation water with high CO2(aq) concentration is CO2 degassing that drives net calcite precipitation (<3\u00a0vol %). This suite of numerical simulations suggest that calcite disequilibrium will have occurred in fluids expelled during ophiolite obduction, but that any associated recrystallization will have occurred at depths greater than those inferred from temperatures measured in the calcite microcrystals. Recrystallization at shallower depths may have been associated by fluid-mixing around the injection points, but reaction kinetics suggests that laterally pervasive alteration would require very rapid flow rates. These results suggest that alternative mechanism(s) are needed to be considered to explain the extensively developed calcite microcrystals and associated microporosity in Mesozoic carbonates of the Middle East.\n               ","90":"\n                  The main reservoir quality controls in Triassic Buntsandstein deposits in the Upper Rhine Graben and surrounding outcrops in Germany and France are discussed to be authigenic mineral precipitates and the vicinity to structural elements (faults and fractures). To better understand reservoir quality controls in this lithology, a detailed diagenetic study based on petrographic methods (optical and SEM) in combination with petrophysical measurements (porosity and permeability) on core material (1133\u20131591\u00a0m TVD) was initiated. This case study highlights that large detrital grain sizes and low compactional porosity loss in association with blocky authigenic cements such as quartz and dolomite are beneficial to reservoir quality, whereas variable illite textures have a dual, but opposite effect on reservoir qualities. Grain coating illite (tangential and radial) may preserve intergranular porosity by inhibition of syntaxial quartz precipitation, while at the same time, if present at grain contacts, tangential illite enhances chemical compaction and reduces the available intergranular volume. The presence of early diagenetic carbonate cemented nodules is also beneficial for reservoir quality in stabilizing the grain framework against compactive porosity loss. Overall, detrital grain size and the intergranular volume, as a result of compaction and cementation, are derived as the main reservoir quality controls. The formation of hydrothermally mineralized veins prior to hydrocarbon charging does not show a distinct impact on porosity and permeability in the sandstone matrix. Fractures and interstices between vein minerals such as barite, galena, tetrahedrite, and siderite are equally covered in hydrocarbon residue, as are all present detrital and authigenic minerals in the sandstones indicating that vein precipitates, if not pervasive, do not alter the overall reservoir quality. This study may indicate additional potential to identify high reservoir quality intervals in the studied succession.\n               ","91":"","92":"\n                  With shale oil becoming an increasingly important resource in global oil and gas exploration and development, the breakthrough pressure of crude oil in shale series source rocks has become an important topic for research on hydrocarbon migration. Shale has long been recognized as an effective source and cap rock, with, up to now, the most common method used for breakthrough pressure testing in shale being the gas method. However, this paper sets out a new system for testing the breakthrough pressure of crude oil in siltstone, mudstone, and shale based on differences in electrical resistance between crude oil and formation water. The breakthrough pressure of crude oil with different lithology was tested in different directions using this method. The results show that breakthrough pressure anisotropy can be observed in mudstone, shale, and siltstone, and that the breakthrough pressure parallel to the bedding direction is one fourth or one seventh of the breakthrough pressure perpendicular to the bedding direction. The horizontal breakthrough pressure of shale is one twentieth to one third of that of mudstone and siltstone, and the vertical breakthrough pressure of siltstone is one seventh of that of mudstone and shale. The breakthrough pressure anisotropy of crude oil reveals that the main migration direction in shale series source rocks is in the direction of bedding unless faults or fractures are encountered. The main migration channels in shale series source rocks are in the horizontal direction, and hydrocarbon migration occurs more easily in laminar shale than in mudstone. Horizontal migration is also the principal mode of hydrocarbon expulsion in thick mudstone and shale. The breakthrough pressure experiments on crude oil in this study also reveal the migration directions and modes in intra-source rocks. This improves on the existing oil migration model and has great significance for understanding the migration of oil in shale source rocks.\n               ","93":"\n                  Magma plumbing systems transport and store magma in the subsurface, as well as playing an important role in feeding eruptions and inducing overburden deformation. Whilst the important role of sills and dikes in these systems is well documented, the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of mafic laccoliths and their role in magma transport and eruption is less well understood. This is due to a paucity of well-documented examples from 3D seismic reflection data, and the limited exposure provided by field examples. Here we use 3D seismic reflection data to document for the morphology and emplacement of a multi-lobed laccolith of inferred mafic composition (the Hammerhead Laccolith (HHL)). This middle Eocene-age intrusion was emplaced at <320\u00a0m beneath the paleosurface within the intraplate Bight Basin Igneous Complex located offshore southern Australia. The HHL is composed of multiple convex-upwards, flat-based, laccolith-shaped lobes between 5 and 270\u00a0m thick and 2\u201314\u00a0km long. Inflation of the lobes resulted in the formation of a \u2264150\u00a0m high, compound forced fold at the paleosurface, whose morphology mirrors that of the underlying laccolith. Subsequent drainage of magma from the HHL to feed small-volume lava flows resulted in the formation of collapse faults which focus on the margin of a magma reservoir, similar to those associated with calderas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using 3D seismic reflection data to document the morphology of a shallow mafic laccolith and its relationship to its erupted products, whilst the HHL is notable for possessing characteristics of both classic laccoliths and shallowly emplaced, multi-lobate mafic sills. We highlight the important role of laccoliths in magma plumbing systems, and their potential for inducing both brittle and ductile host-rock deformation. Finally, our detailed mapping of the HHL and its associated forced fold provides a valuable exemplar that may assist the identification of mafic laccoliths using 3D seismic reflection data in energy-rich sedimentary basins.\n               ","94":"\n                  In permeability modeling of fault damage zones affecting porous sandstones, deformation bands are commonly considered low-permeability structures that influence fluid flow. Permeability in damage zones of such rocks exhibits and is influenced by complex networks of deformation bands separated by volumes of seemingly undeformed host rock. This study used deformation band frequency data to delimit and model the fault damage zone subdomains and fault facies in the hanging wall of the Malta Fault segment in the Rio do Peixe Basin, Brazil. We then integrate in situ permeability data collected in deformation bands and interband spaces (deformed host rock located between adjacent deformation bands) with damage zones and fault facies models to estimate the equivalent permeability perpendicular and parallel to the main fault. Our results indicated a logarithmic decrease in deformation band frequency towards the protolith with local variations controlled by minor faults in the damage zone. We identified three damage zone subdomains (inner and outer damage zones and transitional zone), totalizing roughly 200\u00a0m of width. Permeabilities of the deformation bands and interband spaces increase towards the protolith non-uniformly due to the difference in deformation intensity. The deformation bands and interband spaces in the inner and outer damage zones, which comprise fault facies representing the highest deformation intensities, exhibit permeability reductions of 1\u20133 orders of magnitude compared to the undeformed rocks, whereas 0\u20132.5 orders of magnitude reductions were observed in the transitional zone between the damage zone and the protolith. This study provides new perspectives about the permeability in deformation bands and interband spaces by different subdomains of damage zones and fault facies. This information proved is essential for modeling equivalent permeabilities along damage zones and assessing its implications to siliciclastic reservoirs affected by fault zones, where deformation bands are pervasive.\n               ","95":"\n                  High-resolution 3D seismic and borehole data in the Broad Fourteens Basin, Southern North Sea, are used to investigate the relationship between lithology and fault throw distribution, as well as to understand the reactivation and growth histories of faults developed due to tectonic inversion. Two (2) distinct tiers of faults are identified, and their geometry analysed in detail. Tier 1 faults comprise closely spaced sets of normal faults that resulted from the progressive buckling and stretching of Upper Mesozoic strata during Late Cretaceous to Paleogene tectonic inversion. They have been reactivated, but still show net normal throw separations, even though they were formed during a period of regional compression. Tier 2 faults comprise densely spaced sets of normal faults in Paleogene strata with a broad range of strikes, forming a polygonal pattern. These faults relate to early diagenesis but still record the effect of the Paleogene inversion episode. An important characteristic is that Tier 1 faults are highly segmented, and show differences in throw distribution between shale-rich and sandy intervals. These faults are more segmented with relatively small throw maxima of 14\u00a0ms (17.7\u00a0m) in shale-rich intervals, while sandy intervals are less segmented with larger throw maxima of 32\u00a0ms (40.3\u00a0m). Discrepancies in fault throw distribution and segmentation increase the chances of compartmentalisation or localised fluid flow through fault linkage zones, presenting at the same time significant risks when injecting CO2 in subsurface traps. Recognising the effect of tectonic inversion on supra-salt fault geometry, and reactivation histories, can be crucial to the characterisation of faulted hydrocarbon and carbon capture and storage (CCS) reservoirs in tectonically inverted basins such as the Southern North Sea.\n               ","96":"\n                  The Karewa gas discovery highlighted the potential for commercial gas accumulations in the shallow Miocene-Pliocene stratigraphic horizons, thus changing the exploration strategy in Taranaki Basin, New Zealand.

Mild mechanical compaction and low content of authigenic mineral phases aided in the preservation of the primary intergranular porosity.

The fields are combined structural-stratigraphic traps associated with minibasin-scale folds formed at the basin margin. Field A is adjacent to a megaflap fold with an overturned limb that changes abruptly from a thin to a thick sequence of Paleogene strata along trend. The lateral change in fold geometry occurs at an outward bend in the trend of the salt-sediment interface. Field B is a minibasin-scale fold without an associated megaflap and developed along a more linear salt-sediment interface. Middle to Lower Miocene reservoir sandstones in both fields are moderately dipping-to-overturned and pinch-out stratigraphically prior to intersecting the salt-sediment interface. Trap scale folding and variations in megaflap characteristics are interpreted as primary controls on subseismic deformation, comprising primarily of deformation bands (DBs) observed in core and image logs. Spatial distributions, orientations, and frequencies of DBs are documented from well data in Fields A and B and placed into the trap-scale context to consider their origin. One DB set trends parallel to the strike of the folds in both Field A and Field B and formed in response to bed-parallel shortening. The second set of DBs trends at a high angle to the fold strike and formed to accommodate a change in Field A fold geometry. Flow measurements, along with petrophysical characterization, are used to estimate the impact of DBs on subsurface fluid flow, which is then compared to observed flow measured during well-tests.

The process and products of hyperpycnal flow in tectonically-active margins are still poorly understood, and potentially constitute one of the most important deep-water mechanisms in rift basins. This study integrates core data, well-logging and 3D seismic data to investigate the hyperpycnal flow process and dispersal pattern on the Eocene Dongying rift margin. 17 facies, including 5 conglomerate facies, 9 sand facies and 3 mud facies are identified, interpreted as the product of debris flows, traction currents, turbidity currents, transitional flows and lofting plumes, and suggesting the complex blend in flood-triggered hyperpycnal flow on rift margin. Two different hyperpycnal flow types are identified and a related process model is proposed based on facies sequence, distribution, transport mechanism and flood discharge analysis, including seasonal-flood triggered hyperpycnal flow (SHF) and outburst-flood triggered hyperpycnal flow (OHF). The evolution of the hyperpycnal system suggests two dispersal styles, including proximal sublacustrine fan dominated by OHF and distal sublacustrine fan dominated by SHF, respectively. Climate and tectonic movements are suggested to be the main factors controlling hyperpycnal flow generation and deposition on rift margins. The relatively arid climate enhanced seasonal-flood activity and associated sustained and stable SHF, which further prompt distal sublacustrine fan development during a weak rifting period. On the other hand, the generation of outburst-floods can be attributed to the enhanced fault activity, which corresponds to the periodical tectonic movements in the basin. As a result, proximal sublacustrine fans tend to develop in near-shore topographic lows down-dip of syn-depositional faults due to increased tectonic activities, accommodation and enhanced OHF. A deep-water depositional model is proposed for hyperpycnal systems on rift margins by emphasizing the variety in sedimentary process and dispersal patterns controlled by climate and tectonics forces, which may provide new insights into hyperpycnal flow theories and deep-water exploration in world rift basins.\n               ","99":"\n                  Gas hydrates are widespread along convergent margins, but their distribution is highly variable. This variability has been attributed to a range of factors, such as the source of gas and the occurrence of permeable faults and porous or fractured reservoirs. We test these concepts on the Hikurangi Margin, where gas hydrate occurrences of variable character are well-documented by seismic reflection datasets and scientific drilling. We use 3D gas hydrate systems modelling to reconstruct processes of gas generation, migration and gas hydrate formation through time in two thrust ridges at the deformation front (Glendhu and Honeycomb ridges). We compare the results of scenarios using different fault and rock properties with indications for concentrated gas hydrates in reflection seismic data. Gas hydrate distributions are best reproduced by models predicting focussed gas migration through thrust faults and permeable strata. The gas is predominantly sourced from microbial generation beneath the gas hydrate stability zone (HSZ) in sedimentary troughs adjacent to the ridges and migrates up-dip as free gas. During progressive ridge deformation, gas generation shifts to the landward side of the ridges, where strata are rapidly buried, while erosion occurs at the crest of the ridges. A prominent back-thrust in the structurally more mature Glendhu Ridge diverts migrating gas into the HSZ and leads to preferential gas hydrate formation in the landward side of the ridge. Recycling of gas at the base of the HSZ during the past 2 Myrs led to an enrichment of gas hydrates, first in the center of the anticlines and then progressively more in the landward limbs. We propose that this process of diverting gas migration into the HSZ during thrust ridge formation is a common feature not only at the southern Hikurangi Margin, but in many convergent margins with high sedimentation rates and a thick accretionary wedge.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Vienna Basin (VB) formed at the Alpine\u2013Carpathian junction during the Neogene and underwent a complex tectonic history. The about 200\u00a0km long and 60\u00a0km wide basin is interpreted as extensional basin, initiated by lateral extrusion of the Eastern Alps (Decker et al., 2005; Hinsch et al., 2005; Siedl et al., 2020). The frequently cited pull-apart mechanism as proposed by Royden (1985) was not supported by seismic data (Siedl et al., 2020). The basin is composed of several horst and graben structures forming different subbasins (Fig. 1\n), each with its own geodynamic evolution and deviating paleobathymetric developments during the Miocene. The Miocene tectonic subsidence evolution of the VB has been discussed in detail by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and Lee and Wagreich (2016, 2017). Kranner et al. (2021) analyzed the paleobathymetric development during the marine phases of the VB from the Lower Miocene Ottnangian to the Middle Miocene Sarmatian but not for the Upper Miocene due to the lack of foraminifers. The Upper Miocene Pannonian deposits correspond to the Tortonian of the standard chronostratigraphy (Fig. 2\n) and have been integrated also by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and Lee and Wagreich (2016, 2017) in their analyses. These authors focused on the change of the tectonic regime from piggyback basin to extensional systems during the Early and Middle Miocene.\nThe Pannonian deposits of the Vienna Basin reflect a broad range of depositional environments ranging from beach ridges, sandwaves, river channels, delta lobes to deep lacustrine offshore marls (Kov\u00e1\u010d et al., 1998; Harzhauser et al., 2003, 2004; Borzi et al., 2022). The rapid endemic evolution of its mollusc fauna allows for a detailed biostratigraphic subdivision of Pannonian strata (Papp, 1951; Magyar et al., 1999a, 1999b; Magyar, 2021). Harzhauser et al. (2004) correlated the letter zones of Papp (1951) (Zones A to H) with lithological units in wells G\u00f6sting 4 and Eichhorn 1 and subdivided these according to well log patterns. This scheme is applied herein to resolve and correlate a large part of the Pannonian strata spanning for the first time parts of the northern, central and northern part of the southern VB (Fig. 1).\nCross-correlations of well logs in the VB are hampered by the different tectonic settings in the various subbasins during the Early Miocene and most of the Middle Miocene (Kranner et al., 2021). This situation changed with the Sarmatian when well log patterns can be correlated across large parts of the then shallow basin (Harzhauser and Piller, 2004a, 2004b). These studies showed, that the Upper Miocene is better suited for these correlations as the influence of faults was weaker then compared the early to middle Miocene. Consequently, the well logs display similar patterns throughout the VB.\nLittle is known about the Late Miocene tectonic regime in the VB. This study tries to get a better understanding by using well log correlation. Our work aims for integrating wells from the most important hydrocarbon production fields in the Austrian part of the VB to detect lateral changes in sediment thickness. These data are transferred into sedimentation rates to trace regional differences in subsidence across an about 100-km-long NE\u2013SW trending transect. This on its turn will provide new information on the tectonic evolution of the VB.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pannonian succession of the Vienna Basin is divided into the lacustrine Bzenec Formation, which is linked to Lake Pannon, and the Cary and Gbely formations, which formed in floodplain environments (\u010ctyrok\u00fd, 2000; Harzhauser et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). A biostratigraphic zonation of the Pannonian of the Vienna Basin was developed by Papp (1951), who used letters for the zones. The Bzenec Formation comprises the lower Pannonian units A to C of Papp (1951) and the middle Pannonian units D and E of Papp (1951) (units A\u2013E in Figs. 2, 3\u20136). The Cary Formation corresponds to unit F of Papp (1951) and the Gbely Formation covers the units G and H of Papp (1951). Sedimentation was continuous from units A to F. A hiatus might separate the Cary Formation from the Gbely Formation based on biostratigraphic data (Harzhauser et al., 2004) but seismic data are too poor for these shallow units to detect erosional features (Fig. 7B).\nThe Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg fields are the northernmost hydrocarbon production areas in the investigation area (Fig. 1). They are bound in the west by the Steinberg Fault and by the Eichhorn-Rabensburg High in the east. Wells are partly positioned on an uplifted block (e.g., Bernhardsthal 5, 6, 7, Rabensburg 2) and partly on a downthrown block (e.g., Rabensburg 11, Paltendorf 1, T1) (Figs. 3 and 7\nA). The Zistersdorf Depression and the Moravian Central Depression form major depocenters in this region. The Steinberg Fault is also the western border of the Paltendorf field, which is internally structured by the Zistersdorf and the Droesing depressions and the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst. The Spannberg and Pirawarth fields are situated north of the Spannberg Ridge and the Matzen High. The area is bounded to the NW by the Pirawarth Fault. South of the Matzen High and the Spannberg Ridge follow the Bockflie\u03b2, Matzen and Aderklaa fields. Their western border is formed by the Aderklaa-Bockflie\u00df Fault. The Aderklaa High forms an important high zone. The Schwechat field is the southernmost investigated region and is characterized by the Schwechat Depression. Its western boundary is formed by the Leopoldsdorf Fault and the Oberlaa High. To the east, the Schwechat Depression is bounded by the Markgrafneusiedl Fault and the Enzersdorf High.\n\n\n3\nMaterial and methods\n\n3.1\nWell logs\nThe company OMV provided well log data for Resistivity (RES), Spontaneous Potential (SP) and Gamma Radiation (GR) for Pannonian strata of 36 wells with a sample resolution of about 15\u00a0cm (Figs. 3\u20136\n\n\n\n). The selected wells cover a roughly NE-SW trending cross-section through the Austrian part of the VB, crossing several of the most important hydrocarbon production fields (Fig. 1); see Kranner et al. (2021) for descriptions of the fields). Table 1\n provides the acronyms of the wells and lists the thicknesses for the Pannonian units. Quaternary deposits have not been distinguished because these are not well constrained in the wells due to their minor thickness. Thus, the thickness of the uppermost unit in each well may be slightly uncertain.\nThe resistivity log is an electrical well log, which reflect the resistivity of the drilled sediments and is measured in ohm-meter (\u03a9m). Resistivity is generally high in sandstones and comparatively low in shales (Evenick, 2008). The spontaneous potential log measures the natural or spontaneous potential difference between the given depth in the borehole and the surface in millivolts. The SP log has no absolute scale and only relative changes in the SP values are relevant. The SP log is often read against the shale base line, which is defined by the highest SP values in impermeable shales (right side in the illustrated SP logs). This is opposed by the sand line with the lowest SP signals in clean sands (left side in the illustrated SP logs). Gamma radiation is available only for well Spannberg 21. Gamma radiation in well logs is mainly based on the presence of potassium 40, uranium, and thorium. In sedimentary facies, these elements are often associated with clays and these sediments will generally have a higher GR signal than sand and gravel. The presence of fresh\/salt water and the presence of hydrocarbons may complicate these rule-of-thumbs interpretations of RES and SP logs. Nevertheless, the lithologies of the numerous cores that have been drilled in the VB proof that high RES\/low SP values indicate sand and gravel whereas low RES\/high SP values correspond to clay and marl successions (see Asquith et al., 2004 and Evenick, 2008 for an in-depth discussion on electro logs). The investigated well logs display characteristic successions of high\/low SP\/RES values, with characteristic shale line intervals, which allow for an intra-basin correlation as presented in Figs. 3\u20136. These shale line intervals represent flooding surfaces, which are basin-wide phenomena. In addition, we use a subdivision of the logs (units A\u2013G), which corresponds to the terminology of Papp (1951) and Harzhauser et al. (2004).\nSediment thickness of the units is measured along the wells assuming vertical wells. In some cases, units are incomplete due to synsedimentary erosion. The full data set on thicknesses of units in the investigated wells is given in Table 1.\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic data\nA 3D seismic survey is available for the entire region. Seismic data of several seismic vintages (1994\u20132013) were merged to an approximately 1800\u00a0km2 seismic survey called Vienna Basin Super Merge (VBSM). The extension of the VBSM is shown in Fig. 1. Seismic processing was performed by OMV in-house between May 2012 and February 2014. For details on the VBSM and numerous 2D cross-sections see Siedl et al. (2020). Seismic allows for cross-correlation within hydrocarbon fields but in many cases strong tectonic deformation hampers a straightforward correlation of horizons between uplifted and downthrown blocks (see Fig. 7). Moreover, the seismic resolution for the uppermost 200\u00a0m is very poor, because the seismic survey focused on deeper strata. Therefore, especially the Cary and Gbely formations are not well resolved by seismics and the interpretation relies mainly on well logs.\nThe sediment thicknesses have not been corrected for compaction, because no porosity data are available. Thus, the calculated vertical thickness is based on the in situ (gravitational compacted) thickness and do not represent the paleo-thickness. Consequently, the calculated sedimentation rates have to be read as underestimations.\n\n\n3.3\nBiostratigraphic data\n55 samples have been taken from cores in the core-shed in G\u00e4nserndorf (Austria) for micropaleontological analysis and for the detection of macrofossils. All samples were treated with diluted H2O2 (12%) for several hours and sieved with tap water through a standard set of sieves (500, 250, 125 and 63\u00a0\u03bcm) and later on oven dried at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. 10 samples have been analyzed for Calcareous Nannoplankton. All samples were treated for few seconds in an ultrasonic bath. Afterwards smear slides were made drying few drops of suspension on the object glass and fixed using Canada balsam. All smear slides were investigated with a Leica microscope with 1000 magnification. The identified foraminifers and molluscs are given in appendix 1 (barren samples are not shown); data on calcareous nannoplankton are given in appendix 2.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with the software PAST version 4.05 (Hammer et al., 2001).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nWell log correlations\nThe position of Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary was defined in previous projects (e.g. Harzhauser et al., 2004; Borzi et al., 2022) based on the disappearance of marine fossils and the appearance of lacustrine ostracods and molluscs.\n\nUnits A\u2013B: The boundary is often indicated by a short interval of high amplitude RES values of up to about 20\u00a0m (basal part of blue unit in Figs. 3\u20136). This unit corresponds to unit A of Harzhauser et al. (2004) and can be identified easily, where it overlies Sarmatian shale line logs (e.g., Matzen 303, Sch\u00f6nkirchen 233) but is difficult to detect where it follows Sarmatian channel fills (e.g., Strasshof 2, Raasdorf 1). In these cases, we include unit A in unit B. This unit is well developed in southern wells but is absent in northern wells. The boundary between the Sarmatian and Pannonian deposits corresponds to the sequence boundary SB1 of Borzi et al. (2022).\nUnit A is followed by a unit of low RES and SP values, corresponding to zone B of Papp (1951) and unit B of Harzhauser et al. (2004). Unit B is very variable in thickness. In northern fields, it attains only few tens of meters of thickness (e.g., Bernhardsthal wells, Fig. 3) or may even be missing (Rab 2, Rab 10). It is more prominent in the Paltendorf field (m\u00a0=\u00a085\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a025.7\u00a0m) (Fig. 3), slightly thinner again in the Pirawarth, Spannberg and Bockflie\u03b2 fields (m\u00a0=\u00a059\u00a0m; \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a023.5\u00a0m) (Figs. 4 and 8\n) and increases rapidly from the Matzen field (m\u00a0=\u00a078\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a036.8\u00a0m) (Fig. 5), via the Aderklaa field (m\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a078.3\u00a0m) (Figs. 6 and 7C) to the Schwechat field (m\u00a0=\u00a0262\u00a0m, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a0111.4\u00a0m) (Fig. 7). Especially in the southern part of the basin this unit has a characteristic shale line appearance (e.g., Raasdorf 1, Breitenlee 1, Rutzendorf 1) and is subdivided there by a flooding surface (Fig. 6). In northern wells, this unit displays also high amplitude RES values.\n\nUnits C\u2013D1: A short but marked shale line interval separates unit B from unit C1, corresponding to a major flooding surface (= mfs 1 in Borzi et al., 2022). Above this marker bed follows an up to 260-m-thick unit of funnel-shaped or blocky RES and SP logs, characterized by high frequency and high amplitude RES values typically mirrored by SP logs with lower amplitude fluctuations. Unit C1 has an average thickness of 147\u00a0m (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a043.1\u00a0m) and displays a slight NE-SW trend towards a higher thickness with a maximum in the Aderklaa and Schwechat fields (262\u00a0m in Strasshof 2) (Fig. 6). Unit C2 is bracketed by two marked flooding surfaces and represents a single funnel-to serrated cylinder-shaped unit often with coarsening upwards trend. Its mean thickness ranges around 60\u00a0m with moderate variability (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a014.0\u00a0m). Its lowest thickness of about 45\u00a0m is developed in the Paltendorf and Pirawarth fields but no thickness trend was established. Units C3 to C5 comprises about five to six, serrated, funnel-shaped sequences with distinct coarsening upwards trends and high RES values. The sequences often form three more distinct units (e.g., Paltendorf 1, Pirawarth 3, Bockflie\u03b2 15, Aderklaa 78) but may be largely amalgamated into a serrated cylinder-shaped succession especially in the southern wells (e.g., Rutzendorf 1, Mannsdorf 1) (Fig. 6). In some wells, the SP-log of unit C5 is vaguely bell shaped (e.g., Bockflie\u03b2 7, Bockflie\u03b2 17, Kagran 7) (Fig. 6). The thickness of C3, C4, C5 ranges around 42\u00a0m, 36\u00a0m and 45\u00a0m on average with a standard deviation of 10\u201312\u00a0m. The merged thickness of all three units does not show a general trend but a slightly higher thickness is observed in the Paltendorf Field. Another flooding surface separates units C3\u2013C5 from units C6\u2013D2, which again comprise a succession of broad, funnel-shaped to barrel-shaped sequences. These are often well separated into three to four units by short high SP\/low RES intervals forming a distinct serration (e.g., Aderklaa 78, Deutschwagram 2) (Figs. 5 and 6) but may form blocky, amalgamated units in southern wells (e.g., Rutzendorf 1, Wittau 1, Mannsdorf 1) (Fig. 6). Individual units display a similar average thickness (C6\u00a0=\u00a038\u00a0m, C7\u00a0=\u00a031\u00a0m, D1\u00a0=\u00a037\u00a0m) and a comparable variability in thickness (\u03c3\u00a0=\u00a08\u201314\u00a0m). The thickness of units C6\u2013D1 is rather constant across most of the fields except for the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields with a distinctly lower thickness.\n\nUnits D2\u2013E: Units D1, E1, E2, E3 and E4 are characterized by funnel-to serrated cylinder-shaped sequences with high RES and low SP amplitudes. These units are often blocky and amalgamated, thus complicating cross-correlations, but may also form well separated funnel-shapes sequences (e.g., Eichhorn 1, Spannberg 21) (Figs. 4 and 5). The average thickness is similar for all five units (D2\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0m, E1\u00a0=\u00a044\u00a0m, E2\u00a0=\u00a048\u00a0m, E3\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0m, E4\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0m) with a standard deviation around 12\u201316\u00a0m. Unit D2 attains its maximum thickness in the Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields and becomes thinner towards the south. Similarly, unit E2 displays an overall NE-SW trend towards a lower thickness with a drop in the Bockflie\u03b2 region, which is also evident for unit E4. Consequently, the entire package of units D2 to E4 shows a clear trend from a higher thickness of about 250\u00a0m in the Bernhardsthal, Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields via an intermediate thickness of 213\u00a0m in the Pirawarth, Spannberg, Bockflie\u03b2 fields to a slightly lower thickness of about 200\u00a0m in the Matzen, Aderklaa and Schwechat fields.\n\nUnit F: Units F1 and F2 represent serrated bell-shaped curves (e.g., Paltendorf 1, Ringelsdorf 2, Spannberg 21, Deutschwagram 2) followed by a moderately funnel-to cylinder-shaped unit F3 (e.g., Rabensburg 11, Ringelsdorf 2). Whilst unit F1 is present in all fields, units F2 and F3 have a restricted distribution and F3 is limited to the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields (Fig. 3). The average thickness of F1 is 61\u00a0m, 57\u00a0m for F2 and 53\u00a0m for F3 with a standard deviation around 13\u00a0m (F1) and 21\u201323\u00a0m (F2, F3). Unit F1 displays a slight NE-SW trend of decreasing thickness and unit F2, too, shows a distinct decrease in thickness from the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields towards the more southern fields.\n\nUnit G: The topmost units G1, G2 and G3 are only documented from Rabensburg 11, Paltendorf 1, Paltendorf T1 and Ringelsdorf 2 (Fig. 3). These units are moderately serrated cylinder-shaped to vaguely bell-shaped and attain about 69\u00a0m (G1; \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a013.2\u00a0m) and 80\u00a0m (G2, \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a010.0\u00a0m) in thickness. Unit G3 is incomplete in all available records but attains at least 70\u00a0m in thickness. Seismic data of Borzi et al. (2022) document the presence of deltaic bodies in the lower Pannonian and a decreasing occurrence of clinoforms thereafter (Fig. 7). Instead, continuous reflectors predominate in the middle and upper Pannonian (Figs. 7 and 8). Fault related differences in sediment thickness were detected by Borzi et al. (2022) within the deltaic bodies mainly along the Steinberg Fault System along the northwestern margin of the VB. These faults, however, did not play a role for the herein observed trends.\nThe trends in sediment thickness for most units can only be documented from well data, first, because the resolution of the seismic data does not capture these differences reliably and second, because the faults make it difficult to trace single horizons across larger distances.\n\n\n4.2\nBiostratigraphic correlations\nSamples spanning the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary and samples from units B and C1 were analyzed to test the correlation of the wells. The samples were investigated for foraminifers, ostracods, molluscs and nannofossils. Typical upper Sarmatian assemblages of the Porosononion granosum ecobiozone (Papp et al., 1974) have been detected in Rabensburg 2 (710\u2013920\u00a0m), Rabensburg 10 (1000\u00a0m), Rabensburg 11 (1202\u20131580\u00a0m), Spannberg 2 (880 and 1000\u00a0m), Spannberg 21 (866\u00a0m), Pirawarth 003 (725, 730\u00a0m), Pirawarth 005 (765\u00a0m), Zwerndorf 004 (1010\u00a0m), Aderklaa 78 (1250\u00a0m) and Mannsdorf 1 (1075\u00a0m). Deutschwagram 2 (830\u00a0m) yielded mollusc assemblages with Mohrensternia, which is characteristic for lower Sarmatian strata (Papp et al., 1974; Harzhauser and Piller, 2004a, 2004b). Ostracod assemblages with Pannonian Cytherideidae and Candonidae were detected in Aderklaa 78 (820\u00a0m), Deutschwagram 002 (725\u00a0m), Rabensburg 10 (730\u00a0m) and Mannsdorf 1 (820\u2013950\u00a0m). Pannonian lymnocardiid bivalves were recorded from Matzen 109 (690\u00a0m) and Sch\u00f6nkirchen 233 (545\u00a0m) and Pannonian molluscs (e.g., Pisidium sp., Parvidacna? viennense (Papp, 1953) and Pontodreissena minima (Andrusov, 1900)) derive from Rabensburg 10 (730\u00a0m). The investigated nannofossil assemblages are generally dominated by rare and poorly preserved specimens, which were reworked from Cretaceous and\/or Paleocene to middle Miocene strata; e.g., the Cretaceous Micula staurophora (Gardet, 1955) Stradner, 1963 was recorded in Bo 17 (1180\u20131195\u00a0m), Ma 109 (690\u2013695\u00a0m), Sch\u00f6 50 (549\u00a0m). Autochthonous nannofossils are rarely preserved. Dw 2 (510\u2013516\u00a0m) and DwK 3 (725\u2013730\u00a0m) yield the endemic Praenoelaerhabdus banatensis Mihajlovic, 1993, which is indicative for an early Pannonian age (Marunteanu, 1997; Botka et al., 2019).\nThe cross-correlation of these samples allows to trace the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in most of the investigated wells and supports the correlation of the lower Pannonian units in the investigated well as shown in Figs. 3\u20136.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFrom depth domain to time domain\n\nHarzhauser et al. (2004) correlated the letter zones of Papp (1951) with several wells of the Vienna Basin (including well Eichhorn 1) and established a subdivision based on well log patterns (Fig. 9\n). Lirer et al. (2009) performed an astronomical tuning of the Badenian, Sarmatian and Pannonian successions of the Eichhorn 1 well (Fig. 9). The tuning of Lirer et al. (2009) derived an age of 11.42\u00a0Ma for the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in well Eichhorn 1. This is seemingly in contradiction to the 11.6 ma age of this boundary proposed by Vasiliev et al. (2010), ter Borgh et al. (2013) and Magyar (2021). Unit A, which represents the lowermost Pannonian deposits in the VB, comprises coarse siliciclastics in channel fills. Therefore, sedimentation across the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary was obviously not continuous in the VB. In consequence, the age derived by Lirer et al. (2009) would fit assuming a hiatus of about 200 kyr at the position of well Eichhorn 1. This assumption fits to the fact that the shale line unit B attains only 110\u00a0m in Eichhorn 1 but is more than 250\u00a0m thicker in the wells of the southern VB, which would easily allow to \u201caccommodate\u201d the missing 200 kyr. Nevertheless, a clear caveat of the solution by Lirer et al. (2009) is the lack of magnetostratigraphic tie-points.\nHerein we correlated the letter units of Harzhauser et al. (2004) with the model of Lirer et al. (2009) (Fig. 9) to derive calculations of sedimentation rates based on the thickness of each unit in each well (Table 1). Applying the model of Lirer et al. (2009) results in following durations: B\u00a0=\u00a0120 kyr, C1\u00a0=\u00a0160 kyr, C2\u00a0=\u00a090 kyr, C3\u2013C5\u00a0=\u00a0190 kyr, C6\u2013D1\u00a0=\u00a0220 kyr, D2\u00a0=\u00a070 kyr, E1\u2013E2\u00a0=\u00a0130 kyr, E3\u2013E4\u00a0=\u00a0140 kyr, F1\u2013F2\u00a0=\u00a0150 kyr, F3\u00a0=\u00a0100 kyr. For unit G we cannot deduce such relation because we do not know the time hidden in the gap within this unit as discussed by Harzhauser et al. (2004).\nPaleomagnetic data for the Pannonian of the VB are available only for well Spannberg 21, situated at the Spannberg Ridge in the central VB (Paulissen et al., 2011). The data have been acquired onsite during downhole magnetostratigraphic measurements. Paulissen et al. (2011) identified the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary in well Spannberg 21\u00a0at 866\u00a0m based on biostratigraphic data, which is confirmed herein. Paulissen et al. (2011) provided a magnetostratigraphy of the well and correlated the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary with 11.6\u00a0Ma. This age of the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary is in perfect agreement with data by Vasiliev et al. (2010) and ter Borgh et al. (2013) and was also listed by Magyar (2021) in his synthesis on the Pannonian stage and by Borzi et al. (2022) in their discussion on the Paleo-Danube delta. The herein presented cross-correlations, however, question the magnetostratigraphic data of Paulissen et al. (2011).\nThe basal Pannonian unit B is represented in well Spannberg 21 by an about 50-m-thick sequence. Our cross-correlation suggests that this succession corresponds to the uppermost part of unit B, which is overlain by the Paleo-Danube lobes of unit C1. Consequently, the equivalent of the about 250-m-thick lower part of units B and A, as documented herein from the southern wells, is entirely missing in Spannberg 21. Thus, well Spannberg 21 is an unlikely candidate to cover a continuous Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary. Using the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) would also result in unrealistically low sedimentation rates, which range around 0.3\u00a0m\/kyr for units C1, C2, E1\u2013E2, around 0.2 for unit E3-E4 and would even drop below 0.2 for unit D2 (asterisk in Fig. 10\n).\nAnother problem of the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) is the age of about 9.0\u00a0Ma for the uppermost parts of the Pannonian strata in Spannberg 21 (unit F3). At that time, the northern shelf-margin of Lake Pannon was already established in the southern Danube Basin (Magyar et al., 2013), whereas the VB was isolated from Lake Pannon (Harzhauser et al., 2004). In consequence, a difference of 1.1\u00a0Ma appears for the uppermost beds in Spannberg 21 when the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) is compared to the proposed age of units F2\/F3 derived from the model of Lirer et al. (2009). Furthermore, the model of Paulissen et al. (2011) would require correlating the deposits of unit F with the Turolian Mammal Zone 10, but the unit F mammal faunas of G\u00f6tzendorf and Stixneusiedl belong to the Vallesian Mammal Zone 9 (Daxner-H\u00f6ck and H\u00f6ck, 2015). In consequence, we doubt that the magnetostratigraphy of the Spannberg 21 well can be reliably correlated with the astronomically tuned polarity time scale. We emphasize, however, that Paulissen et al. (2011) did not have information from other wells and could not correlate Spannberg 21 with other records as done herein.\n\n\n5.2\nSediment thickness: influence of paleo-topography\nThe variability of thickness of the individual units, expressed as standard deviation from the mean, ranges around 12\u00a0m for units C2 to G2 but is much higher for units B (97\u00a0m) and C1 (43\u00a0m) (Fig. 11\n). This striking variation in thickness of unit B suggests that it fills a paleo-relief of about 300\u00a0m, which was successively flooded during the initial phase of Lake Pannon. This interpretation is in agreement with the absence of unit A in many northern wells (Fig. 7B). The shallow northern VB provided only little accommodation aside from the Paltendorf region, where subsidence along the Steinberg Fault generated a slightly deeper zone (Fig. 7B). Similarly, the region around the Spannberg Ridge was relatively shallow. The transition into the deeper basin started in the Aderklaa region and culminated in the Schwechat Depression.\nWith the termination of unit B, the topography was partly sealed as seen in seismic data, and remaining differences were subsequently balanced by the sand of unit C1. Therefore, unit C1 still shows a NE\u2013SW trend of increasing thickness which, however, is less prominent than in unit B (Fig. 11). In the northern and central VB, unit C1 comprises delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube, which were described and illustrated by Borzi et al. (2022). The subdivision of unit C1 reflects the succession of delta lobe generations overlaying each other (see Borzi et al., 2022; Fig. 4). In the southern wells, unit C1 contains deltaic bodies of yet undefined rivers. A candidate might have been the Paleo-Triesting, which entered the southern VB during the Pannonian (Harzhauser et al., 2004); Wessely (2006). In wells Rabensburg 10, unit C1 directly overlies Sarmatian strata (Fig. 3), pointing to a topographic high in the Rabensburg area. At that time, the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst might have formed a small island in Lake Pannon. Such relief is also seen in the Paltendorf field, where unit B is missing in Ringelsdorf 2 but shows an onlap close to Paltendorf T1 (Fig. 7B). The rather uniform thickness of unit C2 suggests that the former topography was now largely sealed and that differences in local subsidence were moderate (Fig. 11). Consequently, in all overlaying units, differences in sediment thickness can be interpreted as differences in regional subsidence rates because changes in the lake level would be reflected by a uniform signal. This interpretation is supported by seismic surveys, which show a rather homogenous, continuous stack of reflectors in the investigation area, with only minor erosional features and comparatively rare clinoforms above C2 (Figs. 7 and 8).\nUnits C3 to D1 display also a rather uniform distribution (Fig. 8). A slight difference is only visible along the Eichhorn-Rabensburg High with slightly lower subsidence rates during the deposition of units C6\u2013D1. For units D2 to E4, however, a distinct change in subsidence regime is evident. Now highest subsidence rates occurred in the northern VB in the Bernhardsthal, Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields, whereas sedimentation rates were decreasing in the south (Fig. 10). This trend continued during the formation of units F1 to F3. The overall increase in sedimentation rates was also detected by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) as \u201cmiddle Pannonian pulse\u201d (Fig. 12\n) and explained the coeval subsidence phase in the adjacent Pannonian basins complex.\nThus, the data suggest a northward shift of the depocenter during deposition of the middle Pannonian part of the Bzenec and Cary formations. This successive increase in sedimentation rate, however, does not explain the thick upper Pannonian Gbely Formation in the Rabensburg and Paltendorf fields. Based on the assumption that the entire region was leveled after unit C1, a displacement by faulting of the Bzenec and Cary formations of about 350\u00a0m occurred between the Rabensburg 11 and the Paltendorf wells relative to the adjacent Rabensburg and Pirawarth fields. The timing of this displacement postdates the formation of G3.\nOur model reveals sedimentation rates of 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0m\/kyr for the delta lobes of unit C1 (Fig. 12). Subsequently the sedimentation rate decreased continuously down to 0.5\u00a0m\/kyr from 11.1\u00a0Ma to 10.6\u00a0Ma. The sedimentation rate increased afterwards to about 0.7\u00a0m from 10.5 to 10.3\u00a0Ma. For units E1\u2013E2, this model is in perfect agreement with the sedimentation rates derived by Kern et al. (2012, 2013) for the Hennersdorf core, based on spectral analyses of high resolution data on ostracods and magnetic susceptibility. Subsequently, the sedimentation rate decreased again down to values around 0.5\u20130.6\u00a0m\/kyr until 10.1\u00a0Ma (Fig. 12).\n\n\n5.3\nLake level versus sediment input rates versus subsidence\nIt is tempting to correlate the observed shifts in sedimentation rates with lake level changes and climatic trends. The early Pannonian was characterized a low lake level (Magyar et al., 1999a) and arid conditions (Harzhauser et al., 2007). During the middle Pannonian the lake level was distinctly rising, peaking in its maximum extent during Pannonian Zone E (Magyar et al., 1999a; Neubauer et al., 2016). This ecological trend is reflected by the morphological evolution of certain mollusc lineages (Neubauer et al., 2013) and in the stable isotope record of mollusc shells (Harzhauser et al., 2007). The lake level rise coincided with a strong increase in precipitation in central Europe, which resulted in strongly raised runoff (B\u00f6hme et al., 2008, 2011). Therefore, the low sedimentation rates in the lower Pannonian units C2\u2013C7 would correlate with the arid phase, whereas the middle Pannonian rise of sedimentation rates would coincide with increased runoff and a rising lake level.\nThis interpretation, however, is in conflict with the few available numerical data on lake level changes.\n\nBorzi et al. (2022) performed in-seismic measurements of the clinoforms of the Paleo-Danube delta lobes using true vertical-depth seismic data. These data reveal a minimum lake level of 180\u00a0m during the initial phase of the formation of unit C1 and a subsequent decrease of lake water depth down to about 100\u00a0m towards the top of C1. This declining water depth caused switches of drainage direction of some of the delta lobes (Borzi et al., 2022) but the declining accommodation is not reflected in the well logs. A major lake level rise of Lake Pannon (mfs 3 between units C2 and C3) caused the flooding of the margins of the VB, resulting in back stepping of fluvial deposits into the North Alpine Foreland Basin, which led to the termination of delta deposition in the VB (Harzhauser et al., 2003; Harzhauser, 2009; Borzi et al., 2022). This event, however, is not reflected by increased sedimentation rates. Thus, we assume that subsidence is the main factor explaining the lateral and temporal shifts in sediment accumulation. Lake level changes, however, are reflected by the observed successions of minor flooding surfaces serrating the funnel-shaped well logs. Thus, the general subsidence signal is modulated by lake level oscillations.\n\n\n5.4\nDo the records provide indications for compression during the Pannonian?\n\nPeresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) proposed an onset of a compressional tectonic regime in the VB during the late Pannonian, which was adopted in many subsequent schemes depicting the tectonic history of the VB (e.g., Strauss et al., 2006; Lee and Wagreich, 2016, 2017). Their interpretation was based on deformed upper Pannonian strata in the Cary Formation from the Steinfeld outcrop in the southern Vienna Basin (Peresson and Decker, 1997a, 1997b) (corresponding to units F1\u2013F3). This structure, however, was reinterpreted as synsedimentary slump by Exner et al. (2008) and Grundtner et al. (2009). Therefore, the main geological argument for the existence of a compressional regime in the VB during that phase of the late Pannonian was invalidated. The Gbely Formation is the uppermost unit of the Pannonian sediment stack in the VB (comprising the herein studied units G1\u2013G3 and unit H, which is not covered by our data). A late Pannonian age of the Gbely Fm was established based on the mammal fauna, which allows a correlation with the Turolian mammal zones MN 10\/11 (Daxner-H\u00f6ck and H\u00f6ck, 2015), representing a time span of about 9.6 to 8.0\u00a0Ma (Harzhauser et al., 2004). Herein, only 169\u00a0m of this formation were drilled in the Paltendorf area but the formation, which seems to be subdivided by two gaps, attains up to 450\u00a0m in thickness (Harzhauser et al., 2004). This documents considerable subsidence in the northern VB during the late Pannonian until about 8\u00a0Ma. The seismic survey does not reveal any signs of a compressional regime in the upper Pannonian deposits and the fault systems suggest an extensional mechanism (Fig. 7). Especially, the tectonic displacement of units G1\u2013G3 between the Paltendorf region and the adjacent high zones of the Bernhardsthal and Pirawarth areas occurred along a fault after the deposition of the Gbely Formation (see Fig. 7A). This points to ongoing extensional tectonics even after the deposition of the Gbely Formation and is a further argument against a compressional regime during this phase of the Pannonian. Thus, basin inversion occurred at a later stage of basin development. In the adjacent Danube Basin, \u0160ujan et al. (2021) documented the onset of basin inversion around 6\u00a0Ma, which would fit to our data and would be in the stratigraphic range proposed by Peresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) for the VB.\nThe Gbely Formation (units G1\u2013G3) is preserved only in small graben structures but is missing on the adjacent highs. Thus, the lack of the Gbely Formation in most wells and large parts of the VB documents a post-Pannonian erosion of Upper Miocene strata of about 400\u00a0m. This value increases to more than 500\u00a0m in areas where also the Cary Formation is missing. This erosion is evidence for the basin inversion discussed by Peresson and Decker (1997a, 1997b) and based on our data, the onset of this basin inversion occurred distinctly after 8\u00a0Ma.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nFor the first time, the Pannonian of the Austrian part of the Vienna Basin is correlated along a distance of about 100\u00a0km spanning from the hydrocarbon fields in the Bernhardsthal and Rabensburg areas in the NE to the Schwechat Depression in the SE. The investigated well logs display characteristic, laterally repetitive patterns, which allow the separation of distinct sedimentary units, which can be followed along large distances. The basal Pannonian unit displays considerably variability in thickness with a clear NE-SW trend from low to high thickness. This pattern captures the paleo-topography of the VB after the Sarmatian\/Pannonian boundary, when basinal marls rapidly filled the deeper parts of the basin. At that time, subsidence was high in the Schwechat Depression but negligible in the northern VB, where the Eichhorn-Rabensburg Horst formed a small island. Thus, the early Pannonian tectonic regime was similar to that of the Sarmatian, when tectonic subsidence was also higher in the southern VB than in the northern VB (H\u00f6lzel et al., 2008).\nRemnants of the paleo-relief were subsequently filled by the sand of the delta lobes of the Paleo-Danube in the northern and central VB and by other rivers in the Schwechat region. A lake level rise terminated these deltaic developments and a major flooding surface leveled the investigation area. The overlying units C3 to D1 are relatively uniformly developed in the entire investigation area, indicating no marked differences in subsidence in the various hydrocarbon fields. The sedimentation rate was decreasing during this phase from 0.8 to 1.0\u00a0m\/kyr down to around 0.5\u00a0m\/kyr (Fig. 12). We consider the latter value to be an estimate of real subsidence, whereas the initial sedimentation rate is rather a matter of the rapidly filled accommodation space of the paleo-relief. Subsequently, sedimentation rates were increasing on average to about 0.7\u20130.8\u00a0m\/kyr during the middle Pannonian, which agrees with estimates of Kern et al. (2012, 2013), derived by independent methods. This \u201cmiddle Pannonian pulse\u201d has also been observed by H\u00f6lzel et al. (2008) and was related to the coeval major basin-forming subsidence phase in the adjacent Pannonian basins complex. This pulse, however, was not uniform but was accelerated in the northern part of the VB down to the Spannberg Ridge, whereas subsidence remained constant or decreased in the central and southern VB. The middle Pannonian pulse of subsidence was thus especially related to the Steinberg Fault.\nThis reveals a threefold Pannonian subsidence history of the Vienna Basin:\n\n\u2022\n10.4\u201311.0\u00a0Ma: high subsidence in the southern VB and low subsidence in the northern VB\n\n\n\u2022\n11.0\u201310.6\u00a0Ma: uniform subsidence rates throughout investigation area\n\n\n\u2022\n10.6\u201310.2\u00a0Ma: low subsidence in southern VB and high subsidence in the northern VB\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence for a decrease of subsidence during the late Pannonian and the faults, displacing the upper Pannonian strata between the Paltendorf region and the adjacent high zones of the Bernhardsthal and Pirawarth areas by about 350\u00a0m, suggest persisting extensional tectonics rather than compressional tectonics. Thus, basin inversion occurred after 8\u00a0Ma and is reflected by considerably erosion of at least 400\u00a0m of uppermost Pannonian deposits. Therefore, a Pannonian compressional regime of the VB is not supported by our data.\n\n","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDeep fluid flow in sedimentary basins has a profound influence on many diagenetic processes (for example, dissolution, cementation, and dolomitization), and reservoir properties (Morad et al., 2000; Packard et al., 2001; Boles et al., 2004; Ehrenberg et al., 2006; Moradpour et al., 2008; Howarth and Alves, 2016; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020; Stacey et al., 2021a, b). Fractures can be very important in limestones because they can have a major positive effect on permeability (Nelson, 2001; Dewever et al., 2007). Numerous previous studies have described that faults and fractures can act as pathways for early karst (e.g., Choquette and James, 1988; Guidry et al., 2007; Budd et al., 2013). Recently, considerable work has been done on the fault- and fracture-related diagenetic alteration, especially fault-related dolomitization (e.g., Davies and Smith, 2006; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020; Stacey et al., 2021a, b) and burial (hypogenic) karst (e.g., Klimchouk, 2012, 2017; Bertotti et al., 2020). For instance, Cazarin et al. (2019) suggested that large subvertical faults and fractures favor efficient upward movement of aggressive fluids without considerable heat loss. Similarly, Bertotti et al. (2020) proposed that deep strike-slip faults served as pathways for upward fluid flow forming hypogenic caves. These studies created more attention on tectonically-driven fluid flow, which may be of considerable importance for adequately understanding diagenetic processes and predicting reservoir distribution. However, constraining fluid flow in terms of fluid origin, timing and circulation mechanisms in deep burial basins can be difficult due to the complex tectonic activity, such as faults becoming activated and reactivated.\nRecent hydrocarbon exploration in the Tarim basin has revealed that ultra-deep (>6000\u00a0m) reservoirs are pervasively developed at temperatures exceeding 160\u00a0\u00b0C (e.g., Zhu et al., 2018, 2019; Yang et al., 2020a, b). For example, the recently drilled Luntan-1 exploration well produced high-quality oil from Lower Cambrian carbonate at a depth of 8200\u00a0m. To date, this is the deepest oil discovery in China and among the deepest in the world (Yang et al., 2020a). The recent hydrocarbon exploration success in the southern Halahatang oilfield has shown that the strike-slip faults play an important role in reservoir distribution and hydrocarbon accumulation. Highly productive wells are predominantly found adjacent to the strike-slip faults, with oil production increasing with proximity to faults (Sun et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020b). Consequently, substantial work has been carried out on the structural characterization of strike-slip faults (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2019). Previous works have indicated that large cavities, which constitute the main reservoir porosity, formed by epigenetic karst, and\/or fault-related karst (Sun et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). However, more recent studies have proposed that deep-burial dissolution processes might be responsible for hydrocarbon-hosting cavities (Fu, 2019; Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2020; Ukar et al., 2020). Thus, the mechanism for reservoir formation is still controversial in the study area. A better understanding of the origin and evolution of tectonic-fluids is therefore of significance for the origin of deeply buried karst carbonate reservoirs.\nThis study aims to reconstruct the tectonic-fluid flow history and identify the mechanisms for reservoir formation. To achieve these goals, we have studied the petrographic characteristics of the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements from core samples, together with the analysis of in situ carbon and oxygen isotopes (using SIMS), trace elements, rare earth element and yttrium, clumped isotopes and strontium isotopes. These techniques were used to constrain the origin of each of the tectonic-fluid flow. In particular, the study aims to identify: (\u2160) the origin and evolution of tectonic-driven fluids during the basin history; (\u2161) timing of the fluid flow through petrographical and geochemical evidence and circulation mechanisms within the context of regional tectonics; and (\u2162) with new data to address previous hypotheses for the origin of carbonate dissolution and key factors controlling the distribution of reservoirs in deeply buried basins.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Tarim Basin, located in southern Xinjiang province, northwestern China, is surrounded by the Tianshan Mountains in the north, the Kunlun Mountains in the south, and the Altyn Tagh Mountains in the southeast (Fig. 1\nA). Based on primary basement faults and basement structure, the Tarim Basin can be divided into ten tectonic units, comprising six depressions and four uplifts (Jia, 1997). The southern Halahatang Oilfield, investigated in this study, is located in the southern part of Tabei Uplift, between the Awati depression and the Manjiaer depression (Fig. 1A). It consists of the Jinyue, Yueman, Fuyuan, Guole, and other blocks. Our sample wells were collected mainly from the Jinyue, Yueman, and Fuyuan blocks (Fig. 1B).\n\n2.1\nStratigraphic framework\nThe stratigraphy of the Halahatang Oilfield is presented in Fig. 2\n. It comprises a series of Precambrian (Sinian) to Devonian marine strata, Carboniferous to Permian marine-terrigenous strata, and Triassic to Quaternary terrestrial deposits (Li et al., 1996). The reservoir is hosted by an Ordovician marine sedimentary succession. From base to top, the Ordovician succession consists of the Penglaiba (O1\np), Yingshan (O1-2\ny), Yijianfang (O2\nyj), Tumuxiuke (O3\nt), Lianglitag (O3\nl), and Sangtamu (O3\ns) formations (Zhang et al., 2013). Specially, the Yijianfang and Yingshan formations are the predominant hydrocarbon-producing units, mainly consisting of mudstone, grainstone, and bioclastic wackstone (Zhang et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016) (Fig. 2). The Yijianfang and Yingshan Formations form the focus of this study and were deposited in an open platform with the development of local intra-platform shoals (Sun et al., 2016). Previous work has indicated that most of the hydrocarbons in the Ordovician reservoirs were generated from the underlying Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation source rock (Lu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2020b). Three episodes of hydrocarbon charging have been identified in the study region, which occurred in Silurian, Permian, and Paleogene, respectively (Yang et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2020) (Fig. 2). Specifically, the Permian Hercynian orogeny was the main period of hydrocarbon charging.\n\n\n2.2\nRegional structural geology\nThe Tarim Basin experienced a complicated multiphase tectonic evolution (Jia, 1997). During the dismantling of the supercontinent Rodinia, the basement of the Tarim Basin was separated (Ren, 1996). In the early Paleozoic, the north Tarim Block was under an extensional regime, and the South Tianshan Ocean was formed. The south Tarim Block was characterized by a paleo-Tethys trench-arc-basin system (Mattern and Schneider, 2000; Li et al., 2013). The Manjiaer Depression was formed in the east of the Tarim Block during this extensional regime (Gao et al., 2009). The extensional setting lasted until the Middle Ordovician when subduction began, and the Kudi Ocean in the southwest started to close (Li et al., 2013). The tectonic setting of the Tarim Basin evolved from extension to compression. Increasing orogenic activity in the newly formed active margins in the southwest caused the formation of the Tazhong and the Tabei uplifts. In the studied Halahatang region, an \u201cX-shaped\u201d fault array consisting of both northeast-trending (NE) and northwest-trending (NW) strike-slip faults (F1) was formed in compressional regime (Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b) (Fig. 1B). The compressive regime in the south proceeded until the Middle Devonian. During the Late Devonian to the Permian, an active continental margin developed on the northern margin of the Tarim Basin, where the South Tianshan Ocean was subducted toward the north (Chen et al., 1999). The northeast trending (NE) strike-slip faults (F2) were formed in an extensional regime (Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). In the Triassic, the Tianshan Orogenic Belt continued to uplift due to the collision between the Eurasian Plate and the northern margin of the Tarim Block, leading to an intense uplift and erosion in the Tarim Block. From the Jurassic to Cretaceous, the Tarim Basin was characterized by a weak intracontinental extensional tectonic setting. From the Paleogene, the Tarim Basin has been generally influenced by far-field compression due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates (Sobel and Dumitru, 1997).\nIn seismic data, faulting can be classified into three types (Fig. 3\n), in chronological order: (\u2170) Cambrian-Ordovician transpressional faults, which are characterized by positive flower structures; (\u2171) Silurian-Permian transtensional faults displaying negative flower structures; and (\u2172) Triassic-Paleogene en echelon normal faults, with minor displacement (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b).\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nPetrographic analysis\nThis study is based on a detailed petrographic examination of 20 wells from the southern Halahatang Oilfield. A total of 175 thin sections were analyzed using transmitted light and cathodoluminescence microscopy (CL). The CL apparatus used in the study was a Reliotron Relion III model, with a beam voltage of 8\u00a0kV and a current of 300\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcA. Thin section fluorescence was observed under ultraviolet (UV) light via a Zeiss Axioscope A1 A Pol microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (100\u00a0W).\n\n\n3.2\nGeochemical analysis\nIn situ \u03b413C and \u03b418O measurements were performed by SIMS using a Cameca IMS-1280 ion microprobe at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS), Beijing, China. The analytical procedures were described by Rollion-Bard et al. (2003). Instrumental conditions were similar to Liu et al. (2017). Briefly, the analysis spot diameter was 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm. The internal precision for each spot ranges from 0.009 to 0.015 (% Standard Error). The measurement accuracy was less than 0.6\u2030 for carbon and 0.4\u2030 for oxygen with UWC (international calcite standard from University of Wisconsin) and OKA (Chinese primary calcite standard No. GBW04481) as standards. All in situ SIMS results refer to VPDB.\nTrace element (Fe, Mn, and Sr) geochemistry was carried out by electron microprobe analysis (JEOL JXA 8100) at IGGCAS. Quantitative analyses were analyzed using wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS). The microprobe was operated using an acceleration voltage of 15\u00a0kV, a beam current of 10\u00a0nA, and a beam size of 10 \u03bcm. Natural minerals and oxides were used as calibration standards. The peak counting time was 20\u00a0s for all elements, and the background counting time was 10\u00a0s on the high- and low-energy background positions. The detection limits were 145\u00a0ppm for Fe, 100\u00a0ppm for Mn, and 90\u00a0ppm for Sr.\nIn situ analysis of rare earth elements (with yttrium) were determined by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) employing an Element XR HR-ICP-MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at IGGCAS. The approach is similar to that described in Wu et al. (2018), with isotopes measured using a peak-hopping mode. The laser diameter was 35 \u03bcm, and the repetition rate was 8\u00a0Hz. NIST SRM 610 reference glass was used for external calibration, and ARM-1 (Wu et al., 2019) and BCR glass were used for quality control monitoring. The resulting data were reduced based on the GLITTER software (Griffin, 2008). For most trace elements (>0.005\u00a0g\/g), the accuracy is better than \u00b110%, and the analytical precision (1 RSD) is approximately \u00b110%. All measured rare earth element\u00a0+\u00a0yttrium (REY) contents were normalized to the standard Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS; Mclennan, 1989). Normalized Ce, Eu and Pr anomalies were calculated as follows: Ce\/Ce*\u00a0=\u00a0[Ce\/(0.5La+0.5Pr)]SN (Bau and Dulski, 1996), Eu\/Eu*\u00a0=\u00a0EuSN\/(SmSN\n2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0TbSN)1\/3 (Lawrence et al., 2006), and Pr\/Pr*\u00a0=\u00a0[Pr\/(0.5Ce\u00a0+\u00a00.5Nd)]SN (Bau and Dulski, 1996).\nThe measurement of clumped isotope (\u039447) on vug-filling (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and fracture-filling calcite cements (n\u00a0=\u00a023) was carried out at the Laboratory for Environmental Isotope Geochemistry, IGGCAS, using a Thermo Scientific MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For each analysis, 10\u201312\u00a0mg of sample was weighed for clumped isotope analyses using a fully-automated sample preparation system, the Imperial Batch Extraction (IBEX). The CO2 extraction procedures were described by Qi et al. (2020). The detailed instrumentation and measurement procedures followed the description of Wang et al. (2016). Raw isotope data were processed following the procedure provided by Huntington et al. (2009). Non-linearity correction of the raw \u039447 values and data calibration were performed using solid carbonate standards ETH1\u223cETH4 and the InerCarb method were used (Bernasconi et al., 2021). The adopted \u039447, CDES 25\u00b0C values for ETH were given by Bernasconi et al. (2021). The \u039447 value was adjusted using acid fractionation factor for the reaction of the sample at a temperature of 90\u00a0\u00b0C, an acid fractionation factor of 0.088 was used for calcite (Petersen et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022). Two laboratory standards, namely the NB4 (marble) and P1 (coral) were used to monitor and correct for any drift during sample preparation and measurement using IBEX. The \u039447, CDES 25\u00b0C values (\u00b11 SE) of the NB4 and P1 measured using IBEX were 0.476 (\u00b10.002) \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a060) and 0.702 (\u00b10.002) \u2030 (n\u00a0=\u00a035), respectively. The results were converted to the \u039447 values against the absolute reference frame (i.e., CDES) presented by Dennis et al. (2011). Temperatures were calculated following the equation proposed by Swart et al. (2019) for samples reacted at 90\u00a0\u00b0C without applying an acid fractionation factor. The \u03b413C and \u03b418O values were measured and reported in delta notation relative to VPDB scale as determined using a pre-calibrated CO2 tank gas (\u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u221218.14\u2030 VPDB and \u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u221229.73\u2030 VPDB) as a reference gas. The oxygen isotopic compositions of diagenetic fluids (\u03b418Ow) were calculated following the Kim and O'Neil (1997) equation, and the results were reported relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, \u2030).\nThe Sr isotope analyses were carried out using a VG354 solid source mass spectrometer at the Rb\u2013Sr Isotope Ultra-clean Laboratory at the IGGCAS. A total of 21 samples were collected by micro-drill. Measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios were corrected for mass fractionation using 87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.1194. During the course of this measurement, the standard NBS987 yielded a mean 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.710272\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000012.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nPetrography\nTwo major sets of fractures are present in the studied cores based on their orientation, their dip with respect to bedding, and their chronological timing of emplacement indicated by cross-cutting relationships (F1 and F2, respectively). Based on core observations and thin-section analysis, F1 and F2 fractures show variable fracture infillings. The characteristics and sequence of vug- and fracture-filling cements can be summarized as follows:\n\n4.1.1\nF1 fracture-filling cement\nThe NE- and NW- trending fractures (F1) are usually characterized by sub-horizontal or oblique orientations (Fig. 4\nA, C). They are commonly filled by debris and cemented by sparry geopetal calcite cements (Fig. 4A\u2013D). In some cases, they were filled with greenish clay. Some of filled fractures are crosscut by stylolites (Fig. 4C). F1 fractures have widths of up to 2\u00a0cm and lengths of 15\u00a0dm. Pyrite occurs in F1 fractures in some core intervals (Fig. 4A\u2013D). Two main stages of calcite cements were identified in F1 fractures (named F1-1 and F1-2; Fig. 5\nE) based on petrographic and cathodoluminescence (CL) characteristics. Under plane-polarized light, F1-1 calcite cements (<1.6\u00a0cm wide) exhibit fibrous textures and are non-luminescent under CL (Fig. 5A and B). The second stage of calcite cements (F1-2; <1\u00a0cm wide) in fractures have blocky textures and exhibit a dark red luminescence (Fig. 5C and D).\n\n\n4.1.2\nF2 fracture-filling cement\nThe second set of NE trending fractures (F2) (often <3\u00a0mm wide) crosscutting F1 fractures (Fig. 5A and B, 6\nC) and vugs (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, 6B) are generally sub-vertical, and commonly contain dissolution features (Fig. 4E\u2013H). In addition, bitumen occurs pervasively in F2 fractures (Fig. 4E\u2013H) and fluoresces under UV-light (Fig. 7\nA and B). The F2 fractures are mainly cemented by calcite. In some cases, quartz occurs as a cement following calcite (Fig. 6E and F). Abundant pressure solution features such as sub-horizontal stylolites are present in all core intervals (Fig. 7C\u2013F). Sub-horizontal stylolites are crosscut by sub-vertical F2 fractures (Fig. 7C). Based on the cement morphology and CL characteristics, the F2 fractures are filled by F2-1 and F2-2 calcite cements, showing dull, bright orange to red CL, respectively (Fig. 8\nA and B). In some cases, the fractures are lined or filled only by F2-1 cements (Fig. 8D and E).\n\n\n4.1.3\nVug-filling cements\nThe matrix carbonates in the Middle Ordovician of the Halahatang Oilfield are generally non-porous. Vugs are usually largely filled by green clay and blocky calcite cement (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, H, 6A, B, 9\n). Silica and barite (Fig. 6G and H) are locally observed. Overall, there are two stages of vug-filling calcite cements that were distinguished based on their CL characteristics. The first generation of vug-filling calcite cement (V1) that can reach 6\u00a0cm in size exhibits a zoned dull and bright orange CL pattern and is the most volumetrically significant phases. The second generation of vug-filling blocky calcite cement (V2) exhibits dull-to-brown luminescence (Fig. 9B, E), reaching 2\u00a0cm in size. It is noteworthy that sometimes vugs are found in connection with F1 fractures, and they show similar petrographic infillings (Fig. 6A). The detail paragenetic sequence is summarized in Fig. 10\n.\n\n\n4.1.4\nDissolution in matrix and cements\nIn the matrix, minor dissolution pores are present in the studied wells. Some dissolution pores are observed along stylolites. Most vugs are occluded by green clay, and the above described two stages of calcite cements (Fig. 4E and F, 5G, H, 6A, B, 9). Pervasive dissolution occurs in fracture F1-2 (Figs. 5F and 6C), fracture F2-1, and F2-2 (Fig. 4E\u2013H, 6D, 8). Overall, dissolution in the matrix is rarely observed. The predominant dissolution occurs along fractures.\n\n\n\n4.2\nCarbon and oxygen isotope data\nSIMS in situ carbon and oxygen isotopic measurements on vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are given in Figs. 8, 9 and 11\n and listed in Table 1\n. The V1 cements have \u03b418O values varing in the range of \u22125.48 to \u22120.90\u2030 VPDB (mean: \u22122.72\u2030). The \u03b413C values in V1 cements range from \u22121.09 to 2.34\u2030 VPDB (mean: 0.60\u2030). The V2 cements have a broad range of relatively negative \u03b418O values (\u221210.89 to \u22126.02\u2030), with \u03b413C values ranging from \u22122.07 to 0.6\u2030.\nThe F1-1 cements show well clustered \u03b418O and \u03b413C values (\u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.24 to \u22124.64\u2030; \u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a00.9\u20131.2\u2030). Compared with F1-1 cements, the F1-2 cements have relatively negative \u03b418O values and similar \u03b413C values (\u03b418O\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128.43 to \u22124.98\u2030; \u03b413C\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.3 to 0.8\u2030). The F2-1 cements show more negative \u03b418O values (mean: \u22129.46\u2030) and \u03b413C values (mean: \u22120.72\u2030) compared to F1-2 cements. While the F2-2 cements have very negative \u03b418O (\u221218.39 to \u221210.73\u2030), with \u03b413C values ranging from \u22123.75 to 0.57\u2030 (Fig. 11).\n\n\n4.3\nTrace elements\nTrace-element concentrations of the different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 12\n.\n\n4.3.1\nIron\nThe V1, V2, and F1-1 cements have low iron (Fe) values, with mean concentrations less than 440\u00a0ppm (Fig. 12A). F1-2 cements display slightly higher Fe contents. In contrast, the F2-1 cements have significantly higher Fe contents (as much as 4330\u00a0ppm). In contrast, the F2-2 cements are characterized by low Fe contents (less than 365\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n4.3.2\nManganese\nCompared with the V1 cements, the V2 cements display relatively high manganese (Mn) concentrations (as much as 697\u00a0ppm; Fig. 12A). The mean of Mn concentrations of F1-2 cements is significantly higher than that of F1-1 cements, 431\u00a0ppm, and 174\u00a0ppm, respectively. The Mn concentrations in F2-1 cements vary from 108 to 403\u00a0ppm. In contrast, the F2-2 cements display a slight enrichment of Mn concentrations (up to 527\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n4.3.3\nStrontium\nThe V1 cements exhibit relatively high Sr concentrations (up to 660\u00a0ppm; Fig. 12B), whereas V2 cements have relatively low Sr concentrations, ranging between 152\u00a0ppm and 465\u00a0ppm. The F1-1 cements show high Sr concentrations (up to 728\u00a0ppm) compared to F1-2 cements (mean: 261\u00a0ppm). The F2-1 cements show elevated Sr contents (up to 685\u00a0ppm). In contrast, the F2-2 cements are characterized by low Sr contents (mean: 193\u00a0ppm).\n\n\n\n4.4\nRare earth elements and yttrium\nThe distribution of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in the matrix and different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite are presented in Table 2\n and Fig. 13\n and described below.\n\n4.4.1\nMatrix\nThe mean total content of REY (\u2211REY) for the matrix is 37.0\u00a0ppm. The mean of \u2211LREE (28.2\u00a0ppm) displays an enrichment compared to the \u2211HREE (8.9\u00a0ppm). The REY profiles within the matrix have a positive La and negative Ce anomaly (Fig. 13C). The mean ratio between Y\/Ho is 32 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.2\nFracture-filling calcite cement F1-1\nThe mean \u2211REY for F1-1 cements is 17.8\u00a0ppm. The REY profiles within the F1-1 calcite cements have a positive La and more obvious negative Ce anomaly, and enrichment in HREE (Fig. 13A). All Samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Pr anomaly versus Ce anomalies plot, confirming that these are true Ce anomalies present (Bau and Dulski, 1996; Webb and Kamber, 2000). The mean ratio of Y\/Ho is 42.2 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.3\nFracture-filling calcite cement F1-2\nThe F1-2 calcite cements REY profiles display a low mean of \u2211REY (5.3\u00a0ppm), showing Ce positive anomalies (Fig. 13A). The REY within the F2-1 calcite cements are slightly enriched in MREE. The mean ratio of Y\/Ho is 48.7 (Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.4\nFracture-filling calcite cement F2-1\nThe F2-1 calcite cements REY profiles display a relatively low mean of \u2211REY (7.9\u00a0ppm). Strong positive Eu anomalies ranging from 0.9 to 4.3 are clearly illustrated in PAAS normalized REY profiles (Fig. 13B). The Y\/Ho ranges between 41.0 and 80.5.\n\n\n4.4.5\nFracture-filling calcite cement F2-2\nThe mean total content of REY for F2-2 calcite cements is higher than that in the F2-1 calcite cements (43.5\u00a0ppm). The F2-2 cements exhibit a relatively flat profile (Fig. 13B). The calculation of both Ce anomalies and Pr anomalies shows values close to 1 (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho is low (mean: 32.6).\n\n\n4.4.6\nVug-filling calcite cement (V1)\nThe V1 calcite cements REY profiles display a mean of \u2211REY (4.0\u00a0ppm) and apparent Ce and positive Y anomalies (Fig. 13C). Samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Ce\/Ce* versus Pr\/Pr* plot (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho ranges from 39 to 63 (mean 51; Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.7\nVug-filling calcite cement (V2)\nThe V2 calcite cements have mean values of \u2211LREE and \u2211LREE of 2.3\u00a0ppm and 1.6\u00a0ppm, respectively. They show weak anomalies of Ce with a slight middle REE enrichment (Fig. 13C). Most samples cluster within the marine quadrant of a Ce\/Ce* versus Pr\/Pr* plot (Fig. 13D). The Y\/Ho are high (mean 47; Table 2).\n\n\n\n4.5\nClumped isotope thermometry and oxygen isotope of fluid\nThe clumped isotope results of the different stages of vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements are presented in Fig. 14\n and Table 3\n. The clumped isotope values of vug-filling cements range from 0.549 to 0.598\u2030. The fracture-filling cements display a wide range of \u039447 values from 0.470 to 0.611\u2030.\nThe V1 and V2 cements have average clumped isotope temperatures of 63\u00a0\u00b0C and 85\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with similar \u03b418Ow values around +4.2\u2030 VSMOW, respectively.\nThe F1-1 cements show temperatures of 55\u00a0\u00b0C\u201375\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with \u03b418Ow values of +3.0 to +6.4\u2030 VSMOW. In contrast, calculations for F1-2 cements provide relatively higher temperatures of 78\u00a0\u00b0C\u201399\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with \u03b418Ow values ranging from +4.6 to +7.1\u2030 VSMOW.\nThe F2-1 cements suggest considerably higher temperatures of 113\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013145\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with more positive \u03b418Ow values of +7.2 to +9.0\u2030 VSMOW (Fig. 14). Compared to F2-1 cements, the F2-2 cements have decreased calculated temperatures of 82\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013117\u00a0\u00b0C from fluids with more negative \u03b418Ow values of \u22121.4 to +2.7\u2030 VSMOW.\n\n\n4.6\nStrontium isotopes\nThe analytical results are listed in Table 4\n and shown in Fig. 15\n. The matrix spans a wide ranging radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from 0.7086 to 0.7094 (mean: 0.7089). Both the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements have much lower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios compared to the matrix, averaging 0.7085 and 0.7087, respectively.\n\n\n\n5\nInterpretation and discussion\n\n5.1\nPreservation of primary diagenetic signatures\n\n5.1.1\nAssessing recrystallization\nCarbonate recrystallization mainly occurs by dissolution-precipitation reactions driven by geochemical disequilibria between minerals and fluids (Machel, 1997). This process can lead to the alteration of diagenetic phases both petrographically (e.g., increase in crystal size and changes in mineral texture) and geochemically (e.g., carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes, and trace elements), which may result in recrystallized phases reflecting a mixture of the chemical compositions of the primary carbonates and the late precipitated phases (Machel, 1997; Ingalls, 2019). Furthermore, recrystallization may alter the \u039447 compositions of carbonates via the creation of new C\u2013O bonds (Dennis and Schrag, 2010).\nPetrographic and geochemical criteria are used for evaluating the degree of recrystallization of the investigated samples. Patchy fabrics in CL are only observed in the matrix (Fig. 5A and B, 9A, B), while the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements generally exhibit no patchy CL. In addition, clustered 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Fig. 15) for the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements indicate preservation of primary diagenetic information (Luczaj and Goldstein, 2000; Azomani et al., 2013). The matrix seems to have experienced pervasive recrystallization during burial, which is corroborated by the wide range of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Fig. 15). However, the vug-filling and fracture-filling calcite cements exhibit little evidence for recrystallization.\n\n\n5.1.2\nModelling the effects of solid-state reordering on T(\u039447)\nPrevious studies have shown that solid-state reordering of C\u2013O bonds in buried carbonates exposed to temperatures >\u223c75\u00b0C-100\u00a0\u00b0C can alter primary \u039447 compositions over million-year timescales (Passey and Henkes, 2012; Henkes et al., 2014; Stolper and Eiler, 2015). The paired diffusion model by Stolper and Eiler (2015) is used to predict the extent of solid-state C\u2013O bond reordering during burial and exhumation as it is proved to be more suitable for deeply buried sedimentary basins (Lawson et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020).\nThe model shows that both the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements have experienced some degree of solid-state reordering (Fig. 16\n). Thus our samples have apparent T(\u039447) values that reflect solid-state reordering during burial and heating. While a fully reordering could be excluded because the apparent T(\u039447) of our samples are much lower than the blocking temperature of calcite (i.e., \u223c150\u00b0C\u2013170\u00a0\u00b0C; Henkes et al., 2014; Huntington et al., 2015), and all the analyzed samples show the apparent T(\u039447) lower than their present-day maximum burial temperature of 170\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 14). If full reordering occurs, all cements would have shown a common apparent temperature. Therefore, these models suggest that our samples experienced partial C\u2013O bond reordering without complete equilibration of clumped isotopes at present-day maximum burial temperature.\n\n\n\n5.2\nOrigin and timing of tectonic-diagenetic fluids\n\n5.2.1\nVug-filling calcite cement (V1)\nThe V1 calcite cement is the earliest diagenetic phase filling vugs (Fig. 9). The \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb values are within the expected range of Lower-Middle Ordovician marine values (\u22122 to 2\u2030, \u22126 to \u22124\u2030 PDB, respectively; Veizer et al., 1999; Henkes et al., 2018; Fig. 11). Some of the samples display 3\u2030 positive \u03b418O values compared with coeval marine carbonates, which indicates they may have precipitated from evaporated seawater. In addition, V1 calcite cements have significant negative Ce anomalies (Fig. 13C) consistent with precipitation from oxygenated seawater (Tostevin et al., 2016). Low concentrations of Fe and Mn (Table 1; Fig. 12) further support this interpretation. However, the temperatures obtained from the clumped isotopes are around 60\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 3; Fig. 14), which are higher than the surface seawater temperature expected for the Early-Middle Ordovician (approximately \u223c30\u00a0\u00b0C; Henkes et al., 2018). The relatively high \u039447-derived temperature could be caused by solid-state reordering during burial, as discussed above. If we assume that the V1 calcite cements were initially precipitated at approximately 30\u00a0\u00b0C, then gradually buried to peak burial temperature of 170\u00a0\u00b0C at present, the C\u2013O bond would undergo partial solid-state reordering, and the final T(\u039447) would be around 70\u00a0\u00b0C using the reordering model by Stolper and Eiler (2015) (Fig. 16E). Accordingly, we reconstructed the original T(\u039447) based on this model, and the restored T(\u039447) of V1 calcite cements varies between 21 and 24\u00a0\u00b0C. The partial solid-state reordering results in spuriously elevated T(\u039447) values without change in \u03b418Ocarb, leading to the calculation of higher \u03b418Ow values. Therefore, we recalculated the \u03b418Ow values (Restored \u03b418Ow values) based on the restored T(\u039447) values (Table 3). The average restored \u03b418Ow values of V1 calcite cements is \u22122.7\u2030 VSMOW, which is close to the coeval seawater (\u22122 to 0\u2030 VSMOW; Henkes et al., 2018). Overall, the integrated petrographic and geochemical evidence suggests a marine origin for V1 cement.\n\n\n5.2.2\nVug-filling calcite cement (V2)\nThe V2 calcite cements exhibit more negative \u03b418Ocarb values compared to V1 calcite cements (Fig. 11). The measured \u039447 temperatures are high (mean: 85\u00a0\u00b0C). Similarly, we implemented the model of Stolper and Eiler (2015) to reconstruct the original precipitation temperatures. An original cement growth temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C would give rise to a present-day apparent temperature of \u223c90\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 16F). According to the reordering model prediction, the V2 calcite cements formed at restored T(\u039447) values ranging from 53 to 57\u00a0\u00b0C. The restored \u03b418Ow values vary from \u22121.3 to +1.3\u2030 VSMOW (Fig. 14). This suggests that the V2 cements precipitated from modified seawater through water-rock reactions at elevated burial temperatures, which is further indicated by the enrichments in MREE and absence of Ce anomalies in V2 calcite cements (Fig. 13C). Combined with representative burial history curves for the study area (Fig. 17\n), calculated restored \u039447 temperatures of around 55\u00a0\u00b0C might indicate V2 cements precipitated at \u223c1000\u00a0m depth within the shallow burial diagenetic environment.\n\n\n5.2.3\nFracture filling calcite cement (F1-1)\nThe F1-1 cements are cut by bedding-parallel stylolites (Fig. 4C), suggesting they formed early at a shallow depth (<1\u00a0km) (Machel, 2004). The \u03b413Ccarb and \u03b418Ocarb values for F1-1 cements overlap with coeval marine carbonates (Fig. 11). In addition, the restored average \u039447 derived temperatures of 27\u00a0\u00b0C in F1-1 cements (Fig. 14) are consistent with the coeval seawater temperature. The restored \u03b418Ow values in F1-1 cements (mean: \u22121.7\u2030 VSMOW) are in the range of Ordovician seawater (Fig. 14). The F1-1 cements exhibit a seawater-like REY pattern with a negative Ce anomaly and a positive Y anomaly and enrichment in HREE (Fig. 13A). The pronounced negative Ce anomaly suggests oxidizing conditions (Bau and Koschinsky, 2009; Wallace et al., 2017). Samples clustering within the marine quadrant of a Pr\/Pr* versus Ce\/Ce* plot confirms that these are real Ce anomalies (i.e. not an artefact of the La anomaly) (Bau and Dulski, 1996; Webb and Kamber, 2000; Fig. 13D). Furthermore, the high Y\/Ho values (>40) (Table 2) are consistent with a marine origin. Overall, the F1-1 cement is interpreted to precipitate from near-surface marine.\n\n\n5.2.4\nFracture -filling calcite cement (F1-2)\nThe F1-2 calcite cements display lower \u03b418Ocarb values compared to the F1-1 cements (Fig. 11). The restored \u03b418Ow values in F1-2 cements are more positive (mean: +2.9\u2030 VSMOW), suggesting that marine pore waters evolved to basinal brine via water-rock reaction at increasingly elevated burial temperatures (Taylor, 1974). The relatively high restored \u039447 temperatures of F1-2 cement (58\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C) indicate intermediate burial conditions. In addition, positive Ce anomalies and more MREE enriched of F1-2 cement (Fig. 13A) suggest reducing environments. Moreover, the increased Mn concentrations of F1-2 cements compared to F1-1 also indicate reducing environments (Fig. 12A). Together, all these clues suggest that the F1-2 cements have an intermediate burial origin, precipitated from marine-evolved brine that have evolved towards more reducing burial conditions. Combined with regional burial-history curves (Fig. 17), the F1-2 cement was likely formed during Early to Middle Silurian intermediate burial diagenesis.\n\n\n5.2.5\nFracture-filling calcite cement (F2-1)\nThe F2-1 cements are ferroan (Fig. 12). The restored \u039447 temperatures of F2-1 cements are high, ranging from 93\u00a0\u00b0C to 125\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 14). The strong positive restored \u03b418Ow values of F2-1 cement (up to 7\u2030 VSMOW; Fig. 14) indicate basinal brine source. Alternatively, high \u03b418Ow values may be caused by magmatic fluids. Typically, magmatic fluids are characterized by a \u03b418Ow ranging between +6\u2030 and +8\u2030 VSMOW (Hoefs, 2009). Previous studies have documented magmatic activity related to the evolution of the paleo-Tethys developed in the Permian in the Tarim Basin (e.g., Li et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios in fracture calcite are inconsistent with a magma-derived fluid source (Fig. 15) because ophiolites have much lower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (i.e., \u223c0.705; Kawahata et al., 2001).\nThe REY profiles of F2-1 cement are MREE-enriched and have a lessened Ce anomaly, implying these cements precipitated from reduced burial fluids (Haley et al., 2004; Hood et al., 2018), which is in agreement with the high Fe cements (Fig. 12). In addition, some of the F2-1 cements show a positive Eu anomaly (Fig. 13B), which has been associated with hydrothermally-derived fluids (Bau and Dulski, 1999; Koeshidayatullah et al., 2020). However, positive Eu anomalies can also be produced in other processes, including the breakdown of feldspars during burial diagenesis or highly reducing, organic-rich diagenetic conditions (MacRae et al., 1992; Kim et al., 2012). Together, the F2-1 cements are most likely derived from hot basinal brines. The deep-burial processes probably occurred at the end of Permian (Fig. 17), and the regional Permian magmatic activity perhaps provided heat rather than being involved directly, as discussed above.\nThe relatively wide range of the \u03b413C data in F2-1 cements (Fig. 11) may indicate a hybrid carbon source including both seawater and hydrocarbons. The less negative values may have originated from seawater, while the \u03b413C-depleted calcites may be derived from the oxidation of hydrocarbons (Wiggins et al., 1993). This is supported by the observation that some F2 fractures contain large quantities of bitumen and these bitumen-rich fractures have the lowest \u03b413C values for cements (around \u22123\u2030). The hydrocarbon-bearing fluid probably originated from the Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation black shales, which are considered the primary source rocks in the study area (Lu et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2020b).\n\n\n5.2.6\nFracture-filling calcite cement (F2-2)\nThe F2-2 calcite cements are characterized by the most depleted oxygen isotope compositions (as low as \u221218.39\u2030; Fig. 11), which could be formed during a closed-system recrystallization. However, the low restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW) of F2-2 reflects calcite precipitation at higher water\/rock ratios (W\/R; water-buffered) than F2-1 and\/or mixing with meteoric water. The enriched \u03b413C values (Fig. 11) also suggest high fluid-rock ratios. In addtion, the F2-2 cements show a relatively flat profile without Eu anomaly (Fig. 13B) and low Y\/Ho (<34) (Table 2), perhaps suggesting precipitation from meteoric-derived water (Tostevin et al., 2016; Jones, 2019). This is consistent with the notably decreasing \u039447 temperatures in F2-2 cements compared to F2-1 cements (Fig. 14). Altogether, the geochemical compositions of F2-2 cements show that they precipitated at relatively low temperatures from 18O depleted meteoric water. The paleogeomorphology of the region suggests that the northern Tabei (Shaya) uplift high was probably the source of meteoric fluids that percolated far into the southern Halahatang area (He et al., 2019).\nThe restored T(\u039447) of F2-2 ranging between 52 and 86\u00a0\u00b0C suggests that these meteoric fluids were likely heated and mixed with saline brines from deeply buried parts of the basement in the burial environment. Expulsion of these fluids along steep Cambrian-rooted strike-slip faults into the Ordovician strata most likely occurred during the subsequent uplift and cooling episode of the Late Permian (Fig. 17). The decreased temperatures and \u03b418Ow values from F2-2 cements relative to F2-1 cements could be due to the rapid cooling of fluids during thermal convection and meteoric mixing processes. In some cases, the F2-2 calcite cements appear together with quartz cements (Fig. 6E and F). This mineral assemblage may have precipitated during tectonic inversion in the Late Permian. Taken in aggregate, the arguments presented above suggest that the F2-2 cements were likely sourced from basinal brines with the involvement of meteoric fluids.\nOverall, the Yijianfang Fm limestone experienced multiple dissolution-reprecipitation phases during deep burial (Fig. 10). The diagenetic fluids from different stages of vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements are summarized in Table 5\n. Vugs are occluded by V1 and V2 calcite cements. The stable isotope (Fig. 11) and clumped isotope compositions (Fig. 14) reflect that V1 cements are of marine origin. V2 cements probably precipitated at shallow burial depths, which are indicated by increased clumped isotope temperatures and fluid oxygen isotope compositions (restored T\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a053\u201357\u00a0\u00b0C; restored \u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3 to +1.3\u2030 VSMOW; Fig. 14). F1-1 and F1-2 cements precipitated in horizontal fractures that were crosscut by stylolites. Sea water-like REY patterns (Fig. 13A) and clumped isotopes results indicate that F1-1 calcite cements have formed from near-surface seawater. F1-2 cements were probably precipitated in an intermediate burial reducing diagenetic environment during Early Silurian to Middle Silurian, indicated by clumped isotope (restored T\n\nh\n\u00a0=\u00a058\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C; restored \u03b418Ow\u00a0=\u00a0+1.9 to +4.4\u2030 VSMOW) and REY data (prominent Ce positive anomalies). Partial corrosion of F1-2 cements (Fig. 5F) probably indicates a change in fluid chemistry. The late F2-1 and F2-2 cements precipitated in vertical fractures that crosscut the F1 fractures and stylolites. Hot hydrocarbon-bearing F2-1 cements grew from basinal brines, indicated by high restored \u039447 temperatures (up to 125\u00a0\u00b0C) and high restored \u03b418Ow values (up to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW). Fluids that precipitated F2-2 calcites had decreased restored \u039447 temperatures (52\u201387\u00a0\u00b0C) and lower \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW). Combined with relatively flat REY profiles, F2-2 cements are likely sourced from mixed brines and meteoric water. The subsequent uplift at the end of Permian probably led to the involvement of meteoric water from the northern Tabei uplift high, accompanied by quartz cements. Pervasive dissolution was observed to be associated with F2-1 and F2-2 cements (Fig. 4E\u2013H, 8; discussed below).\n\n\n\n5.3\nOrigin of carbonate dissolution\nCore analysis shows that matrix porosities are low, ranging between 0.07% and 6.37% (mean: 1.22%; Sun et al., 2016), and cavities and fracture-vugs are the main reservoir spaces. Cavities occur as bright spots in seismic data (Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). The chance of drilling abnormalities, including bit drops and lost circulation is as high as 80% in prolific wells (Ding et al., 2020). There are some karstic features observed in the Yijianfang Fm, including cracks and vugs filled by green clays (Fig. 5G), and vugs filled with debris and sparry geopetal cements (Fig. 4A\u2013D, 5H). However, there is no definitive evidence yet for large scale near-surface karst. Typical karst breccias were only observed in the Well JY103 in Upper Odovician Tumuxiuke Fm. This is maybe linked to the subaerial exposure of the Middle Ordovician Yijianfang Fm was brief (1.5\u20132 myr; Sun et al., 2016). Instead, there is much evidence of dissolution observed associated with the F1-2 cements (Fig. 5F), indicating that this dissolution occurred during or postdated F1-2 cements. As argued above, the high restored \u039447 temperatures (58\u201378\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (1.9\u20134.4\u2030 VSMOW) and positive Ce anomalies of F1-2 cements reflect precipitation from Early to Late Silurian reducing burial fluids, within the intermediate diagenetic environments (mesogenetic dissolution). The dissolution appears to occur mainly in areas where calcite-undersaturated fluids were able to flow, e.g., along stylolites, grain-dominated facies, and fractures. In many cases, stylolites contain bitumen and other hydrocarbons (Fig. 7C\u2013E) and display fluorescence (Fig. 7F), suggesting that they had acted as hydrocarbon-bearing fluid pathways within the reservoir. The hydrocarbon emplacement is also indicated by the presence of hydrocarbon inclusions in fracture-filling calcite cements (Baqu\u00e9s et al., 2020). Previous studies suggest that the first hydrocarbon emplacement occurred during the Middle-Late Silurian, following uplift (Yang et al., 2020b; Ding et al., 2020), which could generate acidic fluids resulting in burial dissolution (e.g., Mazzullo and Harris, 1992; Beavington-Penney et al., 2008). Moreover, the similar 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of both the vug- and fracture-filling calcite cements (Fig. 15), compared with the coeval Early-Middle Ordovician ocean (87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0=\u00a00.7085 to 0.7089; McArthur et al., 2020), indicate a marine or burial fluid origin. In addition to our data, Li et al. (2019) measured 87Sr\/86Sr ratios for fracture-filling calcite cements, displaying similar low 87Sr\/86Sr ratios.\nVugs related to F2-1 cements have irregular edges (Fig. 8D), suggesting they were formed by dissolution. Based on the chemical signature (ferroan), the high \u039447 temperatures, and positive \u03b418Ow values, the F2-1 cements probably have a deep burial origin. As discussed above, burial fluids are probably hot deep-seated hydrocarbon-bearing brines, heated by magmatism. During the Late Devonian to Permian extensional phase, the older Ordovician faults (F1) were reactivated, and new NE-oriented faults\/fractures (F2) were created (Li et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2019). Thus, tectonically-driven, hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal fluids circulated through fractures, resulting in the precipitation of F2-1 cements and dissolution. The dissolution may be caused by organic acids formed in the second hydrocarbon emplacement event during the Permian (linked to Hercynian tectonism) (Zhu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). In addition, as documented in previous work, as the deep-seated high temperature fluids move to shallower depths along steep strike-slip faults, the temperatures of the fluids become lower, and the fluids can become undersaturated with respect to calcite (van Berk et al., 2015), which could result in dissolution. High-quality seismic data show large-scale strike-slip faults can provide subvertical pathways for fluids to migrate from the Cambrian source rock (Sun et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b) (Fig. 3).\nDuring the following Late Permian uplift, deep circulation of meteoric fluids from elevated recharge areas may have occurred due to reduced temperatures and pressures. The low restored \u03b418Ow values of \u22125.9 to \u22120.9\u2030 VSMOW for F2-2 cement indicate a meteoric influence. Meteoric fluids, probably sourced from the northeast paleo-high (He et al., 2019), circulated into the basin, mixed with hot 18O-enriched brines, and then discharged upwards through the sub-vertical fractures. Variations in the amount of mixing may explain the large range of \u03b418Ow values and temperatures derived from the clumped and stable isotopes (Fig. 14). Such fluids move along fractures and cause dissolution (Fig. 8A), forming enlarged fractures and caverns. The minor quartz cements (Fig. 6E and F) were likely formed during the mixing of cool meteoric water with hot basinal fluids, which is also reported by Cai et al. (2008).\nDeep burial thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR; Orr, 1977; Machel, 1987) could also be a possible dissolution mechanism. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) associated with oil, is expelled from the basin, and sulfuric acid can form by mixing with more oxidized fluids (Hill, 1990). These sulfuric acid-bearing fluids can dissolve the limestone in the subsurface, producing large cave systems. Chang et al. (2017) documented that heavy crude oil, which was produced during the first oil accumulation in the Silurian, is rich in H2S, and sulfur content can be as high as 2%. Thermochemcial sulfate reduction (TSR) usually requires a high temperature (100\u2013140\u00a0\u00b0C) (Machel, 2001; Jiang et al., 2018a, b). Thus, H2S-related dissolution could explain the observed instances of dissolution in F2 fractures, where there is evidence for fluid temperatures over 100\u00a0\u00b0C. However, given the absence of gypsum and depleted \u03b413C values, major H2S-related dissolution is not supported.\nIn summary, the most likely mechanism for the formation of the reservoirs is burial dissolution, especially related to the multi-stage hydrocarbon emplacements along the vertical strike-slip faults. In addition, the late, deeply circulated meteoric water favors the further dissolution along the F2 fractures.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for reservoir studies\nDuring the Middle Ordovician, the tectonic setting of the Tarim Basin changed from extensional to compressional, caused by the closure of the Kudi ocean in the southwest of the Tarim Block (Li et al., 2013). The subduction and collision processes of the orogenic belts caused the development of NE and NW trending transpressional faults (F1) under a pure shear stress mechanism. During the compressive phase, meteoric fluids may have flowed along early F1 faults, resulting in the formation of some cavities and vugs. However, vugs are generally occluded by V1 and V2 cements (Figs. 5G and 9), which precipitated from marine and increasing burial diagenetic environment (see discussion above). The geochemical data of V1 and V2 overlap with that of F1 and F2 (Figs. 11 and 14), indicating that early F1 fractures probably acted as conduits for the deposition of vug-filling cements. In general, the evidence for early meteoric karst in Yijianfang Fm is weak, and this is consistent with recent studies by Fu (2019) and Baqu\u00e9s et al. (2020).\nAs discussed above, hydrocarbon-bearing fluids are involved in several burial dissolution processes (from F1-2 to F2-1 cements related dissolution). The large volume of F2-1 calcite cement indicates that upward migration of hydrocarbon-bearing brines to the Ordovician reservoirs was a widespread process in the studied area (Figs. 8 and 17). Thus, the hydrocarbon-bearing fluids seem the essential dissolution mechanism in the study area. Similarly, the upward migration of hydrocarbons along with hot brine flow along faults was responsible for the oil accumulation observed in the Michigan Basin (Vogler et al., 1981). Statistics on hydrocarbon charging worldwide (Table 6\n) show hydrocarbon charge exists during deep burial, especially in Cratonic Basin.\nUltimately, an involvement of deeply circulated meteoric water sourced from the northern Tabei topographic high during the Late Permian's uplift could further improve the reservoir quality. He et al. (2019) suggested that the reservoir porosity was controlled by deeply circulated karst along faults. However, they did not provide convincing evidence of deeply circulated meteoric water. This study presents geochemical evidence for deeply circulated meteoric water using clumped and stable isotope analyses (negative restored \u03b418Ow values: down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), which seems to contribute to carbonate dissolution.\nThe distinct tectonic-fluid evolution between F1 and F2 fractures may be linked to tectonic stress and\/or strain differences. The early F1 fractures are transpressional (Zheng et al., 2019), conducive to increasing lateral permeability of the fault zone. This likely created favorable conditions for horizontal migration of tectonic fluids (Salvini et al., 1999). Thus, the early meteoric fluids developed mainly along F1 fractures. Nevertherless, as argued above, hot burial fluids along F2 fractures were probably generated during the Late Devonian to Late Permian extensional (transtensional) regime, indicated by (\u2170) negative \u03b418Ocarb and positive \u03b418Ow; (\u2171) high concentrations of Fe and Sr; and (\u2172) enrichments in MREE and some positive Eu anomalies recorded in F2-1 cements. The F2 sub-vertical strike-slip faults probably facilitated deep burial fluid flow. Deep basinal fluid flow require that faults are open, which usually occurs within extensional basins (Hollis et al., 2017; Hirani et al., 2018). Similar fluid-flow evolution scenarios have previously been suggested for extensional and\/or strike-slip faults settings elsewhere in the world (e.g., Davies and Smith, 2006; Klimchouk, 2017; Bertotti et al., 2020).\nTectonic activity is the most likely driving mechanism for fluid flow, as transporting such deep-seated fluids into the near-surface requires high angle, permeable conduits, such as faults. These faults are the conduits for vertical migration of the hydrocarbon-bearing fluids from the Lower Cambrian Yuertusi Formation to the Ordovician Formation during episodes of tectonic activity. It is worth noting that in thin section, a well-developed micro-fracture network is commonly observed. These microfractures are invisible in plane light (Fig. 7G) but are obvious on fluorescent images (Fig. 7H). The strong fluorescence indicates microfractures serve as hydrocarbon migration paths. These microfractures may play an essential role in the hydrocarbon migration in the deeply buried reservoirs. In summary, hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and basement-rooted strike-slip faults may be critical factors controlling the distribution of the deeply buried carbonate reservoirs in cratonic basins.\nIn contrast to the southern Shunbei and Shunnan area, which shows volcanic events-related hydrothermal dolomitization and silicification controlled by strike-slip fault systems (Cong et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021), there is no evidence for these features in our study area. The data presented here suggest that the reservoir porosity is a result of mesogenetic dissolution by several stages of hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and deeply circulated meteoric water. Thus, the reservoir-forming mechanisms in the north and south of the transitional zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions may be different. Further structural and diagenetic work needs to be done to explain the different deep fluid origins in the transitional zone between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions. In future exploration, the reservoirs situated between the Awati and Manjiaer depressions are the most critical industrial exploration target, and the findings of this study may have significant economic implications.\nIn summary, our study suggests that fault-related circulation of hot hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and the deeply circulated meteoric waters were important in producing porosity within the southern Halahatang reservoir. Our work implies that different tectonic regimes can result in distinct fluid flow mechanisms within carbonate reservoirs. The transpressional regime created favorable conditions for horizontal migration of fluids, while the extensional (transtensional) regime facilitated deep burial fluid flow. These findings may be applicable to other geodynamically-active cratonic basins.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nCarbon and oxygen isotope analysis by SIMS, paired with trace elements, REY, clumped isotope, and strontium isotope analyses of calcite cements from different fracture generations are used to reconstruct a history of regional tectonic fluid flow in the Early-Middle Ordovician carbonate reservoirs in the southern part of Halahatang Oilfield. Based on detailed petrographic observations from core samples, two sets of fractures are identified. The first set of fractures (F1) are sub-horizontal or oblique and crosscut by stylolites. The F1 fractures are dominantly filled by debris and sparry geopetal cements. In contrast, the second set of fractures (F2) are sub-vertical, postdate stylolites and mainly cemented by calcite, usually accompanied by bitumen.\nThe F1-1 cements show \u03b418O and \u03b413C values and REY profiles comparable to those of coeval seawater. Moreover, these cements have restored \u03b418Ow values (mean: \u22121.7\u2030 VSMOW) and restored temperatures (mean: 27\u00a0\u00b0C) derived from clumped isotopes that are consistent with Ordovician seawater. All these suggest that they probably precipitated from near-surface marine environment. In contrast, light \u03b418Ocarb, relatively high restored \u03b418Ow values (mean: +2.9\u2030 VSMOW) and high restored \u039447 temperatures (mean: 65\u00a0\u00b0C), as well as the positive Ce anomalies in F1-2 cements, indicate precipitation in a intermediate burial reducing diagenetic environment.\nF2-1 cements may have originated from hot hydrocarbon-bearing basinal brines derived from the Cambrian strata during Permian tectonic activity. This is indicated by the high restored \u039447 temperatures (93\u2013125\u00a0\u00b0C), high restored \u03b418Ow values (+4.9 to +7.0\u2030 VSMOW), and enrichments in MREE in F2-1 cement. Permian extension is the most likely tectonic event that drove the expulsion of the hot fluids from the basin through the newly formed and reactivated fractures.\nThe significantly negative \u03b418Ocarb values (\u221218 to \u22129\u2030 PDB), low restored \u03b418Ow values (down to \u22125.9\u2030 VSMOW), decreased restored \u039447 temperatures (52\u201387\u00a0\u00b0C), low concentrations of Sr, and relatively flat REY profiles in F2-2 cement suggest that the fluid may be derived from mixture of meteoric water and brines. The inputs of meteoric waters may be from the northern Tabei (Shaya) uplift, which experienced deep circulation and migrated into the burial environment along faults during the uplift of the Late Permian.\nOur new data highlights that acidic fluids associated with hydrocarbons may be an important corrosive agent in our study area during the burial. The ubiquitous presence of fluorescence in stylolites and micro-fractures indicates that they acted as pathways for hydrocarbon-bearing fluids flow. Hydrocarbon-bearing fluids and Cambrian-rooted strike-slip faults are critical factors governing the distribution of the reservoirs.\nThis work improves our knowledge that the past complex tectonic-fluid flows occurred in different tectonic regimes, especially a transtensional regime that facilitated late deep basinal brines flow. Because such tectonic settings are widely observed over the world, structurally controlled fluid-flow reservoirs are expected to be found in many other regions, which will ultimately help predict the distribution of deeply buried reservoirs. Thus, our studies here can function as an analog to other deeply buried sedimentary basins.\n\n","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Sin\u00fa Fold Belt (SFB), located mostly offshore northwest Colombia, together with the San Jacinto Fold Belt, located onshore northwest Colombia, are the leading and trailing parts respectively of a NE-SW trending accretionary wedge developed to the south of the Colombian Basin (Fig. 1\na and b). This NW-directed accretionary wedge resulted from eastwards, low-angle subduction of oceanic rocks and sediments belonging to the Caribbean Plate under arc terranes along the northwest edge of the South American continent that belong to the South American Plate (e.g., Ladd and Truchan, 1983; Ladd et al., 1984) (Fig. 1c). In this paper we will focus on the offshore part of the SFB between the Uramita Fault to the south and the Magdalena Fan to the north. This part of the belt is exceptionally well imaged in high quality seismic data.\nMost of the knowledge on the large-scale structure of the SFB come from geological interpretation of seismic reflection profiles, which has allowed the construction of geological sections (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) as well as structural maps (e.g., Vitali et al., 1985; Cediel and C\u00e1ceres, 2000; Flinch et al., 2003b; Cediel, 2011; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) of the belt, and their integration into lithosphere-scale transects from the Colombian Basin, across the Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto belt, to the San Jorge Basin (included in the Lower Magdalena Basin), to the mountain range (Central and Eastern Cordillera) (e.g., Flinch et al., 2003a; Mantilla-Pimiento, 2007; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015; Flinch and Castillo, 2015; Mora-Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2017) (Fig. 1c), or even to the foreland basin developed eastwards of the mountain range (e.g., Vargas and Mann, 2013). Thus, the SFB has been the subject of many studies, not only because of its scientific interest, but because of its hydrocarbon potential explored from the sixties to present day by many oil companies. However, in our opinion some interesting large-scale issues still need to be fully understood. Some refer to the belt kinematics, i.e., belt shortening, basal detachment displacement and vertical subsidence\/uplift, whereas others refer to its geometry, i.e., taper angle, morphology, relief and thickness. Likewise, the interrelationships between its geometry and kinematics, and how these elements influence each other spatially and through time, must be established.\nRegarding horizontal movements of the SFB, some studies have quantified the shortening responsible for the SFB (e.g., Ruiz et al., 2000; Kellogg et al., 2005; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) and the magnitude of tectonic plate motion (e.g., Freymueller et al., 1993; Kellogg and Vega, 1995; Trenkamp et al., 2002), however, neither the amount of displacement along the accretionary-prism basal detachment nor its relationship with the belt shortening and plate motion have been analyzed. As regards vertical movements of the SFB, we are aware of only one study on the subsidence\/uplift in a Colombian Basin section adjacent to the SFB (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019), but there have been no studies of the SFB up to date. With respect to the taper angle, two analyses have been carried out (Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015), but the new data available allow for more detailed measurements of the taper angle, as well as for quantification of its across- and along-strike variations and the parameters that control it. Regarding the SFB relief, recent sedimentation\/erosion processes have been documented in detail (Vinnels et al., 2010), however, this information has not been correlated yet with the activity and kinematics of the underlying structures. Transversal and longitudinal variations in elements such as the SFB morphology, taper angle and crustal thickness have been documented (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Vinnels et al., 2010; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015), however, the relationship between these variations and the belt kinematics has not been examined, and no zoning of the belt has been established yet.\nTo address these issues, we have carried out a geological interpretation of six regional, depth-converted 2D seismic profiles, with the help of a few well-logs and a high-density grid of 2D time seismic profiles. The data obtained have been employed to characterize and quantify large-scale aspects of the SFB, such as horizontal\/vertical motion, taper and morphology, and their variations, together with variations in the structural style, have allowed us to define different morphostructural regions both across and along strike.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe South Caribbean Deformed Belt, developed along the Colombian and Venezuelan coasts, is an accretionary wedge that runs along the convergent margin between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates (Fig. 1a). The Caribbean-Plate relative motion towards ESE since Late Miocene (e.g., Minster and Jordan, 1978; Trenkamp et al., 2002; Pindell and Kennan, 2007) caused different tectonic regimes depending on the shape of the South American Plate boundary. Motion almost parallel to the coastline gave rise to a strike-slip regime in north Colombia and Venezuela, however, motion mainly perpendicular to the coastline produced a compressional setting in the northwestern Colombian coast. The South Caribbean Deformed Belt in northwest Colombia consists of a NE-SW trending double belt called Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto Fold Belt (Fig. 1b), which resulted from a two-stage development (e.g., Galindo and Lonegan, 2013). Thus, the San Jacinto Fold Belt is the innermost portion of the accretionary belt formed by dextral-transpressional collision\/accretion between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates from Paleocene to Oligocene (e.g., Flinch, 2003a, 2003b), whereas the SFB is the outermost part of the accretionary belt and reflects a Late Miocene to Recent compressive stage related to the Andean orogeny (e.g., Duque-Caro, 1979; Ruiz et al., 2000). This complex scenario was caused by the clockwise rotation of the Caribbean Plate from Cretaceous to the present (e.g., Escalona and Mann, 2011; Ardila and Diaz, 2015). The Sin\u00fa-San Jacinto Fold Belt is bounded to the west by the Uramita Fault which separates it from the North Panama Fold Belt (Fig. 1b); to the south it is bounded by the Western and Central cordilleras; to the east, the Romeral Fault Zone separates it from the San Jorge and Plato basins; it is bounded to the north by the Magdalena Fan; to the northeast, it is separated from the Santa Marta Massif by the Santa Marta-Bucaramanga Fault; and to the northwest, the deformation front is responsible for its thrusting over the Colombian Basin. The Sin\u00fa Fault Zone is the eastern boundary of the SFB and the western boundary of the San Jacinto Fold Belt. The SFB developed over a subducting Mesozoic basement (e.g., Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000; Alfaro and Holz, 2014b) and comprises a Cenozoic sedimentary cover mainly made up of shales with sporadic cherts, sandstones, conglomerates and limestones (Duque-Caro, 1979) (Fig. 2\n). The most important structure is an imbricate system of W-directed thrusts and related folds (Fig. 3\n), as well as piggy-back basins filled with thick sequences of syn-tectonic strata (Kolla et al., 1984; Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Flinch et al., 2003a; Vinnels et al., 2010). The thrusts emanate from a deep main detachment located within deep over-pressured shales, which are the source for mud diapirs and related ductile deformation in the host sediments (Shepard et al., 1968; Ramirez, 1969; Shepard, 1973; Duque-Caro, 1979, 1984; Vernette, 1986; Vernette et al., 1992; Brice\u00f1o and Vernette, 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000). These diapirs, together with normal faults, are mainly developed in the trailing part of the belt (Flinch et al., 2003a,b; Mantilla-Pimiento, 2007).\n\n\n3\nData employed\nSix pre-stack depth migrated seismic lines have been interpreted from the geological point of view although only four are shown here (Fig. 1b). The chosen four lines are approximately perpendicular to the belt, i.e., NW-SE, have an average length of 100\u00a0km and reach a depth of around 22\u00a0km. The spacing between them ranges from 35 to 60\u00a0km. Two additional seismic lines are approximately parallel to the belt, i.e., NE-SW, are more than 800\u00a0km long but we have interpreted around 250\u00a0km, and reach a depth of 22\u00a0km. The spacing between these two lines ranges from 30 to 70\u00a0km. Nowadays, pre-stack depth migration is considered the most accurate method to perform depth conversions of time seismic lines, and that guarantees the precision of the measurements of angles and distances taken in the depth-converted seismic lines.\nIn addition, we have interpreted sixty-one 2D time seismic lines acquired in eight different surveys. These seismic lines exhibit two predominant directions: NW-SE, i.e., approximately perpendicular to the SFB, and NE-SW, i.e., approximately parallel to the SFB. This dataset covers an area of approximately 17,000\u00a0km2, the length of the time seismic sections ranges from 23\u00a0km to more than 400\u00a0km, although most of them exhibit a length in between 50 and 150\u00a0km, and reach two-way travel times from 6 to 8\u00a0s. The spacing between the time seismic lines ranges from 1.5 to 5\u00a0km. Both the depth-converted and the time seismic lines were acquired by the oil companies BP-Amoco, BP Exploration, Intercol, Ecopetrol and Gulf Oil Corporation from 1967 to 2004 and were supplied to us by the company Repsol.\nData from six wells has been employed: a) the Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Site 999 (Sigurdsson et al., 1997), located in the Caribbean Sea approximately 400\u00a0km to the northwest of the SFB deformation front, that penetrates more than 1\u00a0km of Upper Cretaceous-Upper Pleistocene strata (Fig. 1a); and b) five exploration wells, located in the continental shelf about 20\u00a0km from the Colombian coast, that penetrate up to 4.5\u00a0km of Neogene-Quaternary strata (Fig. 1b). The exploration wells in the continental shelf were drilled by the companies Colombian Gulf Oil, Provincia Petroleum, Citco Colombia Petroleum Corporation and Phillips Petroleum from 1969 to 1979 and were supplied to us by Repsol.\nUp to nine stratigraphic units have been defined based on the amplitude, frequency, continuity and geometry of the seismic reflectors (Figs. 2 and 4\n). The software Petrel E&P (Schlumberger), Kingdom Suite (IHS Markit) and Move (Midland Valley-Petroleum Exploration Experts) have been used to carry out the geological interpretation of the seismic data and subsequent data analysis. The specific methodology used to decipher each of the different issues discussed below is explained at the beginning of each section.\n\n\n4\nMain stratigraphic features\nThe study area is made up by a Jurassic to present-day succession (Fig. 2). The Cretaceous to present-day succession is mainly siliciclastic and approximately coarsening upwards (from shales in the lower part to shales, sandstones and some conglomerates in the upper part), as well as shallowing upwards (from deep water sediments evolving upwards to shallow water\/transitional environments). Perpendicularly to the Colombian coast, the thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene succession increases from the abyssal plain (less than 1 km\/more than 3\u00a0km) to the continental shelf (5 km\/almost 6\u00a0km) (Fig. 4). Approximately parallel to the Colombian coast in the continental slope, the Mesozoic-Neogene succession increases from the center-south part of the SFB (Fig. 4c) towards the northeast and southwest, whereas in the continental shelf, it reaches its maximum thickness in the south part (Fig. 4d) and decreases northwards. Although the thickness of the Pliocene-Quaternary sequence is quite variable, approximately perpendicular to the Colombian coast it thickens from the continental slope (approximately 1\u20132\u00a0km) to the continental shelf (almost 3\u20134\u00a0km), i.e., similarly to the pre-Miocene sequence. Approximately parallel to the Colombian coast, the Pliocene-Quaternary succession is thin in the south-central part of the belt and thickens both to the northeast and to the southwest. The different stratigraphic units mapped in the seismic lines are bounded by unconformities. In some localities they become angular unconformities that truncate underlying beds and may be onlapped by overlaying beds.\nIn the Colombian Basin, the Cretaceous and Paleocene successions are syn-rift strata (Fig. 2), although a few normal faults cut and offset Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata. Occasionally, the uppermost Pliocene and Quaternary strata are coeval to the normal reactivation of these older faults.\nThe Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata that constitute the SFB, as well as older underlying rocks, are pre-tectonic with respect to the SFB structures, i.e., they are pre-growth strata (Fig. 2). The Pliocene and Quaternary strata exhibit a number of features diagnostic of syn-tectonic deposition associated with faults, folds and diapirs, and therefore, they are interpreted as growth strata. Nevertheless, the lower part of the Pliocene-Quaternary sequence can be also considered pre-growth or growth, while the upper part can be growth or post-growth strata, so that the stratigraphic position of the boundary between these sequences vary from one structure to another because faults, folds and diapirs developed in the SFB are diachronic (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a; 2022b).\n\n\n5\nMain structural elements of the SFB\nThe SFB is a NE-SW trending fold and thrust belt, more than 200\u00a0km long and around 130\u00a0km wide in its widest part, developed mainly in the continental slope and in the continental shelf offshore northwest Colombia (Fig. 1b). In map view it is a curved belt convex to the northwest (seawards) and it is slightly asymmetric, so that it is wider in the central-north part, and a minor recess and salient occur towards the south (Fig. 3). A NNE-SSW trending and approximately rectilinear fault, named Sin\u00fa Fault Zone, separates the SFB trailing part from the San Jacinto Fold Belt (Figs. 1c and 3). The SFB leading part is separated from the Colombian Basin by the deformation front defined by a frontal thrust or a triangle zone. It exhibits a stepped morphology along strike caused by faults that disrupt its continuity, and is the belt tectonic element that best reflects the belt curved shape (Fig. 3). The SFB is covered by the Magdalena Fan towards the northeast, whereas it ends against the NNW-SSE trending Uramita fault towards the southwest (Fig. 1b). In profile view, the SFB is a wedge bounded by a submarine topography gently inclined to the NW and by a basal detachment gently dipping to the SE (Fig. 4). The wedge apex is located seawards, while the thickest part of the wedge, which may reach more than 10\u00a0km of vertical thickness in the study area, is located landwards. Ductile structures, such as folds and mud diapirs, as well as fragile structures apparently developed under contractional (thrusts), extensional (normal faults) and strike-slip (strike-slip faults) tectonic regimes, occur within the SFB. Some of these structures, such as thrusts, folds, mud diapirs and some normal faults, are longitudinal with respect to the belt, and some of them are transverse, such as tear faults and strike-slip faults (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) (Fig. 3). A brief description of these structures is presented below.\n\n5.1\nContractional structures\nThrusts, together with related folds, are the most abundant longitudinal structures, particularly in the continental slope. Their strike bends from approximately N\u2013S in the south portion of the SFB to NE-SW in the north (Fig. 3). Most thrusts exhibit a listric geometry and form an imbricate thrust system that emanates from a SE gently dipping basal detachment located within Paleocene strata (Fig. 4). Although NW-directed thrusts are the most common structures, a few SE-directed thrusts, i.e., backthrusts, occur. Pop-ups and triangular zones developed in those regions where thrusts and backthrusts coexist. Growth ramp folds, in the form of single-hinge anticlines, box-fold type anticlines and anticlinal monoclines, make up the hangingwall of these thrusts (Fig. 4a, 4b and 4c). Two large anticlines and a syncline, interpreted as growth detachment folds, developed in the SFB south salient (Fig. 4d). The imbricate thrust system and related folds developed according to a roughly forward propagation sequence (piggy-back) from southeast to northwest, both at the scale of a few structures and at the scale of the whole SFB (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a). Sporadic out-of-sequence thrusts are recognized, such as those in the transition from the upper continental slope to the lower continental slope. The basins filled in with Pliocene to present-day growth strata, located above the folds in between thrusts, are piggy-back basins (Fig. 4).\nAn E-W trending fault oblique to the trend of the longitudinal structures, named Canoas fault (Vernette et al., 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000), has been mapped in the north part of the SFB (Fig. 3). The thrusts and related folds developed in the south fault block exhibit different morphologies and are much more abundant than those developed in the north fault block, where there are almost no structures. This fault, developed during recent times, is interpreted as an oblique thrust ramp.\n\n\n5.2\nStrike-slip structures\nSeveral faults, sub-perpendicular to the longitudinal structures, i.e., transverse structures, have been identified in the continental slope (Fig. 3). Their strike ranges from WNW-ESE in the south part of the belt to NW-SE in the north part and they are usually sub-vertical. While the strike of the thrusts and related folds cut by these faults is approximately the same in both fault blocks, the number, spacing and geometry of the thrusts and related folds are different in both fault blocks, and therefore, they have been interpreted as tear faults. The activity of some of these faults ended before the deposition of the youngermost sediments, whereas others are active in recent times.\nThe Rosario Fault (Vernette et al., 1992; Ruiz et al., 2000) is a large fault oblique to the trend of the longitudinal structures, i.e., a transverse structure, developed in the north part of the SFB and in part of the Colombian Basin (Fig. 3). It is a right-lateral, steep fault whose average strike is E-W, and it cuts and offsets thrusts and related folds as well as a tear fault. Its activity is relatively young.\n\n\n5.3\nExtensional structures\nSmall-scale normal faults, involving shallow sediments, developed above the steepest limbs of some anticlines that show bathymetric expression in the continental slope. These faults are longitudinal structures, whose average strike is NNE-SSW in the central part of the SFB and NE-SW in the northern area. Most of them are listric, with dips from moderately to gently to the W and NW (Figs. 3, 4a, 4b and 4c). Some of these NW-directed normal faults branch at depth with a gently NW-dipping detachment, which may be the Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR), i.e., the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (Shipley et al., 1979), forming imbricate normal fault systems. NW-directed, listric thrusts, whose dip varies from gently to moderately to the ESE and SE, emanate from the leading edge of the detachment forming toe thrusts. These normal faults and their associated toe thrusts developed in recent times, and are from simultaneous to younger than the thrusts and related folds.\nLarge listric normal faults, dipping both to the NW and to the SE, have been mapped in the continental shelf (Fig. 3). The average strike of these longitudinal structures ranges from NNE-SSW to NE-SW. Gentle rollover anticlines and sets of second-order normal faults occur in the hangingwall of these normal faults. Some faults root into the basal detachment, whereas others are shallower faults that become horizontal at intermediate depths and become toe thrusts. Some of these normal faults were reactivated as reverse and normal faults, remaining inactive in between fault reactivation periods. These normal faults cut and offset the thrusts and related folds, and some toe thrusts related to these normal faults resulted from reactivation of a portion of previous thrusts. These normal faults developed approximately during middle Pliocene time, and their reactivation took place up to present-day.\n\n\n5.4\nMud structures\nDiapirs are longitudinal structures developed mainly in the continental shelf. They exhibit an elongated shape in map view and their main elongation axis ranges from N\u2013S to NE-SE (Fig. 3). In general, the sidewalls of the diapirs are steeply inclined to vertical (Fig. 4a, 4b and 4d). Some overburden sediments located above the crests of the diapirs and the sediments pierced by the diapirs exhibit anticline geometries caused by the intrusion of the diapirs. Crestal-collapse normal faults developed above some mud diapirs. Mud diapirs occur in the hangingwall and foot wall of thrusts, and in the core of some hangingwall anticlines related to thrusts, so that they probably initiated slightly before or synchronously to the thrusts and related folds from Pliocene to present-day. Some mud diapirs are located close to listric normal faults with related rollover anticlines.\n\n\n\n6\nMain structural features of the Colombian basin\nThe Colombian Basin is a large elongated basin located offshore northwest of Colombia (Fig. 1a). Only the south part of the basin adjacent to the SFB has been studied here. It is filled in by sub-horizontal Cenozoic strata on top of Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary and igneous rocks (Fig. 4). All these rocks are involved in a basement high developed in the south part of the study area (Fig. 5\n). In addition, horsts and grabens bounded by NE-SW faults, that dip from moderately to steeply both to the SE and to the NW, occur (Figs. 3 and 5). These normal faults were active mainly during Cretaceous and Paleocene times, however, some normal faults also cut and offset Eocene, Oligocene and part of the Miocene strata. Some of these normal faults propagated up section in recent times and were active as normal faults.\n\n\n7\nAmount of horizontal tectonic motion\n\n7.1\nPlate motion\nThe shortening responsible for the SFB formation in the study area started in the Pliocene and is still active today according to the age of the syn-contractional strata (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022a); this means that this region has been shortened approximately during the last 5.3 Myr. The present-day rates of convergence between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates for this region, estimated by taking GPS measurements during 25 years, are 10\u00a0mm\/yr (Freymueller et al., 1993), 10\u201315\u00a0mm\/yr (Kellogg and Vega, 1995) and 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mm\/yr (Trenkamp et al., 2002). Assuming that these plate motion rates (from 10 to 20\u00a0mm\/yr) remained constant during the whole 5.3 Myr of SFB development, and that the South American tectonic plate remained stationary with respect to the Caribbean tectonic plate, then the Caribbean tectonic plate would have moved approximately from 53\u00a0km to 106\u00a0km from Early Pliocene to present-day.\nSome NE-SW normal faults developed during Mesozoic and\/or Paleogene-early Neogene in the south portion of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB deformation front (Fig. 3), reactivated as normal faults during Pliocene-Quaternary time, may furnish information on the rates of SFB development. Thus, we propose that the Caribbean tectonic plate bended as it subducted under the South American tectonic plate and supported the weight of the overlying SFB while it was being emplaced. This lithospheric flexure probably induced extension in the outer portion of the lithosphere flexure hinge resulting in normal faulting, i.e., flexural extension. This extension was not accommodated by new normal faults in the Colombian Basin but by reactivation of old normal faults with favorable orientation, such as the NE-SW faults mapped in the west part of the study area (Figs. 3 and 6\nb) whose strike may be sub-parallel to the flexure hinge. As the Caribbean tectonic plate subducted, the flexure hinge probably migrated away from the continent at a similar rate to that of the SFB advance seawards (Fig. 6a). This would explain why one of the normal faults located closer to the continent (Cretaceous-Paleocene fault reactivated during Pliocene, intersected by section lines C\u2013C\u2032 and D-D\u2032 in Fig. 3) ceased to be active by the end of the Pliocene, while the normal fault located farther away from the continent (Cretaceous-Paleocene fault reactivated during Quaternary, intersected by section line C\u2013C\u2019 in Fig. 3) ended its activity in recent times. Assuming that the lithospheric flexure hinge migrated from southeast to northwest, the distance between these two normal faults measured perpendicularly to their traces depicted on the map in Fig. 3 could reflect the spatial migration of the lithospheric flexure hinge. This distance divided by the time elapsed between the termination of activity of both normal faults might give us an approximate rate of the lithospheric-flexure hinge migration from the end of the Pliocene to the present-day. Since the distance measured between these two faults is 29\u00a0km and the approximate time difference between the termination of activity of both faults is 2.58 Myr, the rate obtained is 11\u00a0mm\/yr. If we assume that the rate of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration is approximately equivalent to the rate of advance of the SFB deformation front, then the rate of advance of the SFB deformation front from Pliocene to Present, obtained using flexure-related normal faults, is in full agreement with the 10\u201320\u00a0mm\/yr rate of convergence between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates for the study area, estimated during 25 years using GPS measurements (Freymueller et al., 1993; Kellogg and Vega, 1995; Trenkamp et al., 2002). Obviously, the rate of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration estimated should be taken with caution since precise ages of the strata are not available and some assumptions may not be totally correct, such as the direction of migration of the lithospheric flexure hinge.\n\n\n7.2\nOverriding plate shortening\nThe Pliocene to present-day shortening responsible for the SFB has been measured in the continental slope and in part of the continental shelf using the four depth-converted seismic profiles sub-perpendicular to the SFB trend (Fig. 4). The boundary between the pre- and syn-contractional sequences has been used to estimate the shortening. This is an easy identifiable, well imaged and continuous reflector, and its age is approximately Lower Pliocene, although it may vary across the belt. The shortening has been estimated as the difference between the length of the folded\/faulted reflector and the cross-section width in between the sub-vertical pin lines located in the Colombian Basin and the sub-vertical loose lines in the continental shelf (Fig. 4). The shortening has been underestimated because: a) strain is likely to have occurred in the shale succession but it has not been accounted for because the measurement method employed assumes constant bed length, b) the shortening has been only estimated in the continental slope and in a portion of the continental shelf adjacent to the continental slope since we do not have depth-converted seismic profiles across the portion of the continental shelf closest to the coast and on land, and c) the significant amount of sediment volume loss due to water expel during accretion (Moore et al., 2011) has not been considered in our estimations. The shortening obtained using the four seismic sections ranges from 11.3\u00a0km to 22.8\u00a0km. These shortening values are apparent values because the seismic profiles are oblique to the tectonic transport vector. They have been converted to true shortening values using Cooper (1983) equations and taking into account the angle between the direction of the seismic lines and the tectonic transport vector (approximately from N110E to N120E, i.e., WNW-ESE according to Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). The true shortening values range from 13.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71\u00a0km to 23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0km, i.e., from almost 19%\u201330% shortening. These values must be taken with caution due to possible errors made in their measurement, in the geological interpretation of the seismic data and in the depth conversion. Our shortening values are lower than those obtained by Ruiz et al. (2000) and Kellogg et al. (2005) based on the analysis of folds and faults depicted in cross sections, which are 60\u201365\u00a0km (40%) and more than 50\u00a0km (40%) respectively; the reason is that our depth-converted sections do not cover the whole SFB from the deformation front to the boundary with the San Jacinto Belt. However, our shortening values are relatively similar to those obtained by Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015) which range from 27.6 to 31.4\u00a0km (27\u201332%). Taking into account that the estimated shortening has been produced during 5.3 Myr and assuming a constant shortening rate, the average shortening rates range from 2.5 to 4.5\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n7.3\nInterplate slip\nThe consistency between the average rates of tectonic plate motion (measured during 25 years) and those of lithospheric-flexure hinge migration (derived from data covering the last 2.58 Myr), both estimated using different methods, makes it reasonable to assume that: a) the plate motion rates measured using GPS during the last 25 years remained approximately constant during the last 2.58 Myr, and perhaps during the whole 5.3 Myr of SFB development, and b) much of the motion of the Caribbean and South American plates has been accommodated at the edge of the plates with not much intraplate deformation. At subduction plate boundaries, strains accumulate within the overriding plate in response to motion of the down-going plate. To a first approximation, the sum of the margin interplate slip and the shortening in the overriding plate is equivalent to the total plate convergence (Nicol and Beavan, 2003) (Fig. 7\n). Therefore, margin interplate slip can be estimated by subtracting the shortening in the overriding plate from the total plate convergence. Assuming that the motion rate of the Caribbean tectonic plate has been approximately constant from 10 to 20\u00a0mm\/yr over the last 5.3 Myr, then the overriding plate shortening values obtained from the seismic lines represent from 13% to 45% of the total Pliocene-Quaternary movement of the Caribbean tectonic plate estimated above. These percentages are minimum values that would increase if considering the strain, plus the sum of all the SFB shortening from the deformation front to the trailing part of the SFB (Sin\u00fa Fault Zone), plus possible mistakes derived from measurements, interpretation and processing. Thus, the remaining 55\u201387% of plate convergence would be the maximum values accommodated by margin interplate slip, i.e., slip on the subduction thrust. This means that the maximum displacement along the basal detachment would range from 29.15 to 92.22\u00a0km. Taking into account that the shortening has been produced during 5.3 Myr and assuming a constant rate of basal detachment displacement, the average rates of basal detachment displacement range from 5.5 to 17.5\u00a0mm\/yr. If the Caribbean-Plate motion rate in the past had been less than the current one and\/or part of the plate movement would have been accommodated by intraplate deformation, then the displacement along the basal detachment would be less. Apparently, the percentage of basal detachment displacement seems very high with respect to the plate convergence, however, similar values have been obtained in other regions, such as the Hikurangi margin located in the boundary between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates, where \u226580% of the convergent component of relative plate motion was accommodated by interplate slip (Nicol and Beavan, 2003).\n\n\n\n8\nAmount of vertical tectonic motion\n\n8.1\nTectonic subsidence\/uplift\nA backstripping analysis has been carried out to estimate the tectonic component of subsidence in both the SFB and the Colombian Basin. The thickness of the stratigraphic units has been measured in the depth-converted seismic profiles. The ages in million years of the stratigraphic tops have been taken from the International Stratigraphic Chart v 2019\/05 (International Commission on Stratigraphy, 2019). Although the different stratigraphic units are separated by unconformities, we have assumed that no hiatuses occur between them, because no accurate information about their ages is available. We have used the same exponential function of porosity variation with depth for all the stratigraphic units, being the c coefficient equal to 0.5 and the porosity at zero depth equal to 50%, because no porosity well logs are available and all the stratigraphic units are mainly made up of shales. We have assumed that the water depth at the time of sedimentation of the different stratigraphic units was the current water depth in the Colombian Basin, because they are interpreted to be deposited in similar deep-water environments. However, since the deposition of the Pliocene and Quaternary sediments was approximately coeval to the SFB formation, we have assumed that the water depth during their deposition in the SFB was the same as it is at their current location. Standard values of density equal to 3.3\u00a0g\/cm3 for the asthenosphere and 1.0\u00a0g\/cm3 for water have been used. Thus, the numerical values obtained for the tectonic subsidence may not be reliable, however, the trend of the functions obtained probably is. The purposes of this analysis are: a) decipher whether tectonic subsidence or uplift occurred in the different regions and at different times, b) identify variations in the tectonic subsidence\/uplift patterns across strike (Colombian Basin-deformation front-continental shelf) and along strike (south part-central part-north part), c) estimate rates and values of tectonic subsidence\/uplift due to the Pliocene-Quaternary SFB development, and d) link the tectonic subsidence\/uplift patterns to geodynamic phenomena derived from the SFB development.\nFirstly, we have compared two tectonic subsidence curves (Fig. 8\na and b), derived from two stratigraphic columns located in two different structural positions within the Colombian Basin (Fig. 8c). These columns are located in the southwestern part of one depth-converted seismic profile approximately parallel to the SFB trend; one in the downthrown hangingwall and the other in the uplifted foot wall of a normal fault that bounds the graben mapped in the northwest part of the seismic section depicted in Fig. 6b. These two columns have helped us to figure out small-scale variations in the tectonic subsidence pattern in the Colombian Basin. All the stratigraphic units from Cretaceous to present-day occur in the downthrown fault-block column, whereas the Eocene and Oligocene are absent in the uplifted fault-block column due to a hiatus or eroded section. The tectonic subsidence was moderate in both columns from Cretaceous to Paleocene when normal faulting with relatively high displacement took place in the Colombian Basin; null in the uplifted fault block and slow in the downthrown fault block during the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, when sporadic normal faults with relatively small displacement still developed in the Colombian Basin; and very fast during Pliocene and Quaternary in both columns when the development of the SFB caused lithospheric flexuring in the Colombian Basin.\nSecondly, we have compared twelve tectonic subsidence curves (Fig. 9\n), derived from stratigraphic columns located in three different structural positions along the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB trend (Fig. 4). Three columns have been built in each profile: one in the Colombian Basin, one in the continental slope adjacent to the SFB deformation front, and one in the continental shelf adjacent to the SFB shelf break (Fig. 7c). Thus, we have obtained four tectonic subsidence curves in the Colombian Basin, four in the deformation front and four in the trailing part of the belt. Our purpose is to characterize large-scale variations, both along and across strike, in the tectonic subsidence pattern as a result of the SFB development. The path of the tectonic subsidence curves derived from the four columns located in the Colombian Basin is very similar (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). Similarly, the tectonic subsidence pattern obtained for the four columns located in the continental slope is similar (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h), and the tectonic subsidence pattern obtained for the four columns located in the continental shelf is almost identical (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9l). Thus, there are no significant differences along strike. According to the twelve curves, the tectonic subsidence is fast during Paleocene, and slow during Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, although it increases from the Colombian Basin to the continental shelf. The main differences occur during Pliocene and Quaternary. In the Colombian Basin, the Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence increases with respect to the Eocene-Oligocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). In the continental slope, the Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence is similar to the tectonic subsidence during the Eocene-Oligocene-Miocene except for the southernmost profile where uplift occurs (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h). In the continental shelf, a pronounced uplift occurs during the Pliocene-Quaternary (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9l). We believe the Colombian Basin suffered a remarkable tectonic subsidence during Pliocene and Quaternary times because it is located on the Caribbean subducting plate that sank below the South-American overriding plate and supported the SFB tectonic and sedimentary load. The Pliocene-Quaternary subsidence near the SFB deformation front was partially compensated by the belt uplift, and therefore, there was little tectonic subsidence or even some small tectonic uplift. A noticeable tectonic uplift took place in the continental shelf during Pliocene and Quaternary due to the SFB development.\nAlthough the numerical values derived from the tectonic subsidence curves are not reliable, the comparison between values obtained in different times and in different regions might be significant. Thus, we have estimated tectonic subsidence\/uplift values during the SFB development by subtracting the tectonic subsidence values obtained at the end of the Miocene from the values obtained during the Pliocene-Quaternary. While there has been tectonic uplift of approximately 0.6\u00a0km in the southern part of the SFB deformation front (Fig. 9e), in the central and northern parts of the deformation front there has been about 0.2\u00a0km of tectonic subsidence (Fig. 9f, g and 9h). In the continental shelf the tectonic uplift ranges from to 2.6\u00a0km in the southern part of the belt (Fig. 9i), to 2.7\u20133\u00a0km in the central part (Fig. 9j and k), to slightly more than 2.2\u00a0km in the northern part (Figure 9l). Thus, the most similar behavior between the deformation front and the continental shelf in terms of subsidence\/uplift has occurred in the southern portion of the belt where uplift has taken place at both sites. On the contrary, in the central portion of the belt, the behavior has been dramatically different with slight subsidence in the deformation front and large uplift in the continental shelf. The behavior has been intermediate in the northern portion of the belt with slight subsidence in the deformation front and moderate uplift in the continental shelf. Since these figures were achieved during a time span of approximately 5.3 Myr, the average rates of tectonic uplift inferred in the most uplifted region, i.e., the continental shelf, range from 0.4 to 0.6\u00a0mm\/yr.\n\n\n8.2\nVertical tectonic thickening\nThe wedge vertical thickness has been estimated at different localities in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB (Fig. 4) and a map of iso-contours of wedge vertical thickness in the continental slope has been constructed by interpolating the available data (Fig. 10\n). The wedge vertical thickness near the deformation front, measured from the seafloor to the basal detachment, is less than 4\u00a0km in the central profiles across the belt and increases to almost 6\u00a0km in the southern profile, and to more than 5\u00a0km in the northern profile (Fig. 10). The wedge vertical thickness near the shelf break is 10\u00a0km in the northern profile and decreases progressively to approximately 9\u00a0km towards the southern profile. Thus, the difference between the wedge vertical thickness measured in the deformation front and in the continental shelf break is maximum in the central profiles across the belt, minimum in the southern profile, and intermediate in the northern profile.\nThe orthogonal thickness of the whole stratigraphic sequence has been measured at different localities in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB (Fig. 4) and an isopach map has been constructed by interpolating the available data (Fig. 10). The amount of vertical tectonic thickening has been estimated by subtracting the orthogonal thickness of the stratigraphic sequence from the wedge vertical thickness at each locality. As expected, the amount of vertical tectonic thickening increases from the deformation front, where it is 0, to values around 0.5\u20132.1\u00a0km in the shelf break area. The stratigraphic thickness contours and the wedge vertical-thickness contours (Fig. 10) are not strictly parallel but intersect each other more than once. This indicates that the sedimentary basin infilling did not fully control the SFB structure, so that variations occurred along strike. The greatest difference between the magnitude of the isopachs and that of the wedge vertical thickness occurs at the central part of the belt, indicating a greater vertical tectonic thickening in this region. The minimum tectonic thickening occurs in the south part of the belt and an intermediate tectonic thickening occurs in the north part. Taking into account that this thickening occurred during a time span of approximately 5.3 Myr, the average rate of vertical tectonic thickening in the most thickened regions has been 0.4\u00a0mm\/yr.\nThe absolute values of horizontal tectonic motion estimated in the section above have been compared with the values of vertical tectonic movement estimated in this section. The total horizontal motion has been estimated as the sum of the SFB shortening and the displacement along the SFB basal detachment. The vertical motion has been estimated as the maximum tectonic uplift. The horizontal component of motion is far greater than the vertical one; thus, the horizontal motion component reaches percentages higher than 90%, whereas less than 10% has been accommodated as vertical motion.\n\n\n\n9\nRecent motion\n\n9.1\nMorphostructure\nThe SFB reaches around 130\u00a0km in width in its central portion, measured from the Sin\u00fa Fault Zone to the deformation front, decreasing towards both edges to approximately 95\u00a0km to the north and 110\u00a0km so the south (Figs. 3 and 11\na). The width of the continental shelf and its adjacent land, measured from the shelf break to the Sin\u00fa Fault Zone, reaches its maximum value (around 75\u00a0km) in the south part of the belt decreasing progressively to approximately 45\u00a0km in the north. The continental slope can be divided into upper continental slope, bounded by the shelf break and a slope break within the continental slope, and lower continental slope, that extends from this slope break within the continental slope to the deformation front (Fig. 11). The width of the whole continental slope, i.e., from the shelf break to the deformation front including both the upper and lower continental slopes, is maximum in the central part of the belt (almost 40\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and almost 30\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope) and decreases both to the north (almost 30\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and almost 15\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope) and to the south (slightly more than 15\u00a0km wide the upper continental slope and 0\u00a0km wide the lower continental slope).\nThe dip of the seafloor in the continental shelf and in the abyssal plain changes from less than a degree to slightly more than a degree to the NW, whereas the dip of the continental slope seafloor ranges from slightly less than 2\u00b0 to slightly more than 7\u00b0 to the NW (Fig. 4). The seafloor dip in the upper continental slope, from less than 2\u00b0 to almost 4\u00b0, is lesser than the seafloor dip in the lower continental slope, from slightly more than 3\u00b0 to slightly more than 7\u00b0. The seafloor dip in the upper and lower continental slopes increases from the central part towards both the north and south parts of the belt. The seafloor dip difference in the upper versus the lower continental slope increases from less than 2\u00b0 in the central part of the belt up to almost 5\u00b0 in the north and up to almost 4\u00b0 in the south.\nThe seafloor in the continental shelf and in the abyssal plain is approximately a planar surface, but the continental slope seafloor may be either planar or irregular (Fig. 11). The width of the irregular portion of continental slope seafloor increases progressively from south to north, so that almost no irregularities occur in the south part of the belt, whereas the whole continental slope seafloor is irregular in the north part of the SFB (Fig. 11b). The boundary between regular and irregular bathymetry is oblique to the boundary between the upper and lower continental slope, so that, the seafloor in the upper continental slope displays a more regular bathymetry than that of the lower continental slope.\n\n\n9.2\nNeotectonics\nThe seafloor in the SFB shows evidence of recent superficial processes, such as sedimentation, channel and canyon erosion, slumping, etc. (Vinnels et al., 2010). However, these processes have not been intense enough to mask the bathymetric expression of recent thrusts and related folds, recognized as elongated hills in the case of anticlines and elongated depressions in the case of synclines. Since all the structures involve approximately the same lithologies and submarine erosion is similar throughout the entire SFB, we can assume that an irregular seafloor is due to active underlying structures, while a regular seafloor, either because of erosion or because of structures mantled by sediment fill, indicates that the underlying structures are inactive.\nMany structures located in the east portion of the SFB are not topped by seafloor irregularities, whereas many structures located in the westernmost part of the belt have caused bathymetric irregularities in the seafloor (Figs. 11 and 12\n). This suggests that the tectonic activity responsible for the development of thrusts and related folds propagated from ESE (inactive structures at present) to WNW (active structures in recent times). This is in accordance with the forward or piggy-back sequence of propagation of thrusts and related folds deduced from growth stratal patterns (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021, 2022b).\nThe continental slope seafloor in the south edge of the belt is approximately regular, except for the most frontal structure that constitutes the deformation front in this area; thus, only this structure may be presently active, whereas the rest of structures seem to be inactive. The irregular geometry of the whole continental slope seafloor in the north part of the belt suggests that most structures located in this region are presently active (Figs. 11 and 12). The width of the region in which the structures have bathymetric expression, the number of structures developed below the irregular area and the seafloor irregularity is much greater to the north than to the south. This suggests that the tectonic activity of the belt in recent times has been much higher in the north sector of the belt than in the south one. This along-strike variation in tectonic activity could be explained in two different ways. a) If we assume that the Caribbean tectonic plate is slightly rotating clockwise with respect to the South American tectonic plate along an axis located south of the study area, then a larger amount of Caribbean Plate would subduct below the South American Plate in the north part of the SFB than in the south part. b) In the southern profile, the Pliocene and Quaternary sediments are very thick and are distributed throughout the entire profile (Fig. 4d). This could be the result of a possible increased sediment influx during the Pliocene-Quaternary coming from the Atrato River, located south of the study area (Connors, pers. com.). Because of increased sediment, the taper in this region could be maintained (or even be supercritical) without internal tectonic thickening, i.e., without structure activity. If this hypothesis were true, one of the most remarkable consequences would be that uplift produced onshore to the south of the study area could influence the SFB development.\nIn outline, the boundary between regular and irregular bathymetry is not strictly parallel to the strike of the thrusts and related folds developed in the continental slope (Fig. 12). Thus, some structures with no bathymetric expression to the south exhibit bathymetric irregularities to the north, suggesting that the tectonic activity responsible for the development of these particular structures stopped before in the south (inactive part of the structure) than in the north (active part of the structure). This points out that these structures propagated according to a combined frontal and lateral propagation model (Poblet, 2020). Although the available seismic profile grid is not dense enough, it seems that the position of the boundary between active and inactive structures in some localities is controlled by tear faults.\nA positive bathymetric relief, much higher than the adjacent reliefs, developed above a thrust-related anticline located at the boundary between the upper and lower continental slopes in the north (bathymetric profiles 1 and 2 in Fig. 11b) and south-central (bathymetric profiles 6 and 8 in Fig. 11b) parts of the SFB. It is likely that the relief height is somehow related to the amount of thrust displacement and to the age of activity cessation of the underlying structure. Assuming that the temporal factor is the most important controlling parameter, we can state that the structure located at the boundary between the upper and lower continental slopes is younger than the surrounding structures. Thus, this structure would be an out-of-sequence thrust with respect to the general piggy-back thrust sequence. This timing is in accordance with that deduced from growth strata and cross-cutting relationships between this structure and adjacent structures in the geological interpretation of the seismic profiles (Rodr\u00edguez, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n10\nCritical taper\n\n10.1\nTaper measurements\nThe taper angle is the sum of the bathymetric surface slope (\u03b1), measured from the deformation front to remarkable slope changes within the continental slope or to the continental shelf, and the basal detachment dip (\u03b2) (Davis et al., 1983). A large number of points corresponding to the seafloor and the basal detachment have been digitized in each of the four depth-converted seismic profiles depicted in Fig. 4. These points have been adjusted by linear best-fit functions to calculate the average slope of the submarine topography and the average dip of the basal detachment. The coefficients of determination R2 obtained for the best-fit linear functions vary between 0.8 and almost 1 in the case of the submarine topographic slope, and from 0.9 to almost 1 for the basal detachment dip. The values of these coefficients, very close to 1, guarantee that the linear functions obtained are reasonable.\nThe azimuths of the four depth-converted seismic profiles are N154E for the southernmost one and from N132E to N136E for the other three (Fig. 1b). The azimuth of these seismic profiles is not strictly perpendicular to the bathymetric contours (Fig. 11a) and to the trace of the main longitudinal structures on the structural SFB map (Fig. 3). Thus, the average slope of the submarine topographic surface and the average dip of the basal detachment obtained from the four seismic profiles using best-fit functions are not true but apparent dips. The azimuth of the depth-converted seismic profiles forms an angle from 3\u00b0 to 34\u00b0 with the azimuth of the maximum dip line of the main thrust surfaces and that of the main fold limbs. In order to estimate the true average slope of the submarine topographic surface and the true average dip of the basal detachment from their apparent average dips in the four seismic profiles, the following equation has been used:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03c6\n=\na\nr\nc\nt\na\nn\n\n(\n\nt\na\nn\n\n\u03c6\n\u2032\n\n\/\nc\no\ns\n\u03b3\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the true dip, \u03c6\u2032 is the apparent dip measured on the seismic profile using a best-fit function and \u03b3 is the angle between the seismic profile azimuth and the azimuth of the maximum dip line of the longitudinal main structural elements.\nIn addition, the four sections obtained from the seismic profiles (Fig. 13\n) have been compared with the bathymetric profiles obtained from the bathymetric map to double check them (Fig. 11b). The average dips of the upper and lower continental slopes in the section obtained from the center-south seismic profile (Fig. 13c) are very similar, while these dips are different in the bathymetric profiles perpendicular to the bathymetric contours constructed by ourselves (bathymetric profiles 5, 6 and 8 in Fig. 11b). The center-south seismic profile is more oblique to the SFB trend than the rest of profiles. To sort this out, the geometry of the lower continental slope in this profile has been modified (Fig. 13c) according to a 3D surface generated from our bathymetry and a new true slope has been calculated.\nThe taper angle in the lower continental slope ranges from 6.9\u00b0 to 8.4\u00b0, while it ranges from 5.5\u00b0 to 7.2\u00b0 in the upper continental slope (Fig. 14\n). The taper angle estimated in the lower continental slope decreases from the central-south portion of the SFB to the north edge. This decrease occurs because the detachment dip in the north edge increases but the dip of the lower continental slope decreases more. The taper angle in the upper continental slope remains approximately constant along strike, except for the SFB south edge where it increases. This increase is due to an increment in the dip of the upper continental slope in the south part of the belt, although the detachment dip remains approximately constant along strike.\n\n\n10.2\nEstimations of pore pressure, friction and strength\nThe critical angle is the equilibrium angle established at the leading edge of a wedge that can slide along a basal detachment without undergoing internal deformation (Davis et al., 1983). In the SFB, folds related to thrusts and out-of-sequence thrusts giving rise to marked seafloor irregularities in some localities of the transition zone between the lower and upper continental slope (Fig. 11b) contributed to increase the taper, while normal faults and related toe thrusting, as well as erosional unconformities, developed in some portions of the continental slope and the continental shelf (Figs. 3 and 4) contributed to reduce the taper angle. These observations suggest that the SFB taper angle might have been subcritical in some periods and regions, and supercritical in others. A numerical analysis of the parameters that control the taper angle has been carried out in order to gain insight into the understanding of the causes of the across- and along-strike variations of the SFB taper angle.\nSince the critical angle theory is fulfilled for mechanically homogeneous wedges (e.g., Davis et al., 1983), we have assumed that the SFB is a homogeneous wedge, and this has allowed us to perform a simple analytical approach. The fact that variations in the bathymetric surface inclination are reflected in slight changes in the basal detachment dip (Fig. 13) suggest that the SFB may be a mechanically homogeneous wedge, because in non-mechanically homogeneous wedges variations in the slope of the bathymetric surface are not associated with variations in the basal detachment dip (Suppe, 2007). Of course, the basal detachment dip is not the only determining factor to infer whether a wedge is homogeneous or heterogeneous, since, for instance, variations in the strength of the basal detachment could take place due to lithology and\/or fluid pressure changes. In fact, we must keep in mind that the across- and along-strike variations described by Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015), Rodr\u00edguez (2020) and Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021) rather suggest that the SFB is not strictly a homogeneous wedge. Thus, the results obtained should be taken with caution.\nSince the geometry of a wedge depends on the pore pressure and internal friction (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990), first of all, we have searched the literature for the most appropriate range of values for these physical parameters to be applied to the SFB taking into account its characteristics. We have assumed that the pore pressure in the wedge (\u03bb) is approximately equal to the pore pressure at the detachment (\u03bbb) although we admit that the wedge pore pressure may be up to 10% lower than the detachment pore pressure, and that the friction coefficient in the wedge (\u03bc) is equal or greater than the basal friction coefficient at the detachment (\u03bcb) with a maximum difference of 30% between both values. The minimum pore pressure considered is 0.4, since we assume that the sediments within the wedge are close to the fracturing point, and therefore, their pore pressure must be greater than the hydrostatic pore pressure (\u03bbh\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.4). According to Hubbert and Rubey (1959), a pore pressure equal to 1.0 would correspond to a subaerial wedge in which there is no fluid in the pores. Thus, the value of 1.0 has been discarded for the SFB, but values up to 0.9 have been admitted because these values can be reached in overpressured wedges, such as the Makran (Harms in Davis et al., 1983), Barbados (Moore and Von Huene, 1980), Aleutians (Hottman et al., 1979) and Oregon (Moore and Von Huene, 1980) wedges amongst others. The coefficients of internal friction, estimated from fracturing laboratory experiments, range from 0.6 to 1.0 (Dahlen, 1990), being 0.85 the universal value of Byerlee (1978) for most rocks; their corresponding internal friction angles (\u03c6) are 30\u201345\u00b0. Since the resistance of rocks decreases in saturated samples with high clay content (Morrow et al., 1981), coefficients of friction below 0.6 (equivalent to friction angles below 30\u00b0) have been also admitted because the sediments involved in the SFB include a large amount of clays. Summarizing, the range of values chosen are: a) pore pressure in the wedge (\u03bb) and at the base of the wedge (\u03bbb) from 0.4 to 0.9, b) coefficient of friction in the wedge (\u03bc) and at the base of the wedge (\u03bcb) from 0 to 1, and c) angle of friction (\u03c6) (related to the coefficient of friction \u03bc) from 10\u00b0 to 45\u00b0. All the range of values for the pore pressures, coefficients of friction and friction angles, as well as the dips of the detachment measured in the four depth-converted seismic profiles approximately perpendicular to the SFB trend, have been introduced in equation (86) of Dahlen (1990) to obtain theoretical taper angles (\u03b1+\u03b2), wedge strengths (W) and basal detachment strengths (F). This equation is a useful approximation for wedges with narrow taper angles, where the maximum compressional stress axis is almost horizontal and the basal detachment is very weak. The SFB accomplishes these requirements because: a) the taper angles range from 5.5 to 8.4\u00b0, i.e., they are small, b) thrusts and backthrusts with similar dips coexist, i.e., the maximum compressional stress axis is almost horizontal, and c) shales constitute the detachment horizon, i.e., the basal detachment is very weak. Varying the pore pressure 0.1 units and the friction angles 2\u00b0 each time, we have obtained thousands of theoretical taper angles. These results have been compared with the actual taper values measured in the four depth-converted profiles. At first sight, the best pore pressures, coefficients of friction and strength values would be those whose resulting theoretical taper angles were more similar to the actual taper values measured in the depth-converted profiles, however, more issues need to be considered.\nIn order to determine the most appropriate pore pressure, friction and strength values for the continental slope, solutions that do not meet the following three conditions have been discarded: a) the difference between the taper angles estimated using the equation and those measured in the four seismic profiles must be as low as possible (we have assumed that less than 0.867\u00b0 is a good approximation for the upper continental slope and less than 0.838\u00b0 is a good approximation for the lower continental slope); b) the pore pressure, friction and strength values must be the same for the four transects because we have assumed that the wedge is approximately homogeneous; and c) the wedge pore pressure must be equal to or up to 10% lower than the detachment pore pressure, and the wedge friction coefficient must be equal to or up to 30% higher than the detachment friction coefficient. Three solutions meet these conditions for the upper continental slope and four coincidences have been obtained for the lower continental slope (Table 1\n). We have chosen the solutions whose pore pressure, friction and strength values for the upper continental slope are more similar to those obtained for the lower continental slope following the principle that the wedge is approximately homogeneous (solutions framed by red rectangles in Table 1). The taper angle of the upper continental slope measured in the seismic profiles that differs more from the theoretically estimated taper angle is that of the south profile (underestimated by 0.86\u00b0), whereas the taper angle measured in the seismic profiles that resembles more the estimated taper angle is that of the north profile (overestimated by 0.50\u00b0) (Fig. 15\n). The greatest difference between the theoretically estimated taper angle and the measured taper angle for the lower continental slope occurs in the center-south profile (underestimated by 0.83\u00b0), whereas the minimum difference occurs in the center-north profile (overestimated by 0.30\u00b0) (Fig. 15).\nTo double-check the wedge strength and the basal detachment strength obtained for the active part of the SFB, i.e., mainly the lower continental slope, a technique created by Suppe (2007) has been applied. According to this author, the strength of active, mechanically-homogeneous wedges and the strength of their basal detachments can be directly determined from the linear covariation of surface slope (\u03b1) and detachment dip (\u03b2), without strong assumptions about the specific strength-controlling mechanisms. This strategy has been successfully applied to experimental dry sand wedges, the Niger Delta thrust belt, the Taiwan mountain belt, and a particular thrust responsible for an earthquake. The wedge strength and the basal detachment strength obtained for the lower continental slope of the SFB using the linear best-fit function and equations (3) and (4) of Suppe (2007) is 1.74 and 0.27 respectively, although we must admit that the R2 coefficient is 0.4, which indicates that the fit is not very good as only three data points are available (Fig. 16\n). The difference between the values calculated from combining all the parameters in Dahlen (1990) equation and from the linear covariance strategy of Suppe (2007) is 0.287 for the wedge strength and 0.034 for the basal detachment strength, being always greater the values estimated using the linear covariance method. These small differences point out that the results obtained from both methods are consistent, and suggest that they could be reasonable values since they are similar and have been calculated employing methods unrelated to each other.\nThe values chosen in our simulation of the taper angles for the upper continental slope and for the lower continental slope are identical in terms of basal pore pressure, internal friction, basal friction and fault strength, but they differ in the internal pore pressure (0.6 for the upper continental slope and 0.7 for the lower continental slope) and in the wedge strength (1.93 for the upper continental slope and 1.45 for the lower continental slope). The fact that the calculated internal pore pressure is smaller in the upper continental slope with respect to that of the lower continental slope is in accordance with the taper angle measurements, lower in the upper continental slope and higher in the lower continental slope. Thus, the wedge may not be strictly homogenous, but it does not differ too much because the differences in the values obtained are small. The taper-angle controlling parameters obtained here are different from those deduced by previous authors because: a) the input data and the methodology employed here are different from those of previous authors, b) Toto and Kellogg (1992) analysis is based on five topographic profiles whereas the basal detachment dip is supposed to be a constant value, and c) Bernal-Olaya et al. (2015) employed only two sections across the belt derived from the geological interpretation of seismic profiles.\n\n\n10.3\nTemporal and spatial variations of taper angle and pore pressure\nAs mentioned above, some features in the SFB such as thrusts and out-of-sequence thrusts, normal faults and related toe thrusts, and erosive unconformities are responsible for the modification of the taper angle. Nevertheless, taking into account that the basal pore pressure, the internal friction and the basal friction obtained for the upper and lower continental slopes are equal, while the internal pore pressure is somewhat different (Table 1), it seems reasonable to assume that variations in internal pore pressure may have also contributed to taper angle variations. To illustrate these variations, we have constructed a graph in which the bathymetric slope is plotted versus the basal detachment dip for different internal pore pressure values (Fig. 17\n). The basal pore pressure, internal friction and basal friction values employed to construct the graph (0.7, 1 and 0.8 respectively) are the ones chosen in the section above for both the upper and lower continental slopes. The bathymetric slopes and detachment dips measured for the upper and lower continental slopes in each of the seismic profiles have been plotted on this graph.\nThere is a slight discrepancy, whose maximum value is 0.1 units, between the pore pressure values estimated numerically in the section above (Table 1) and the pore pressure values obtained graphically from the bathymetric slope versus basal detachment dip graph shown in Fig. 17. The numerically-estimated pore pressure for the upper continental slope is 0.6 (Table 1), whereas the graphically-estimated pore pressure is generally lower (comprised between approximately 0.5 and 0.55) (Fig. 17). The reason is that the numerically-estimated taper angles are higher than the measured ones (Fig. 15), except for the south profile in which the graphically-estimated pore pressure is higher (around 0.65) because the numerically-estimated taper angle is lower than the measured one. A similar situation occurs for the lower continental slope where the numerically-estimated pore pressure is 0.7 (Table 1), whereas the graphically-estimated pore pressure is lower (it ranges between 0.65 and 0.7) (Fig. 17) in the north and center-north profiles -in this case the numerically-estimated taper angles are higher than the measured ones-, but on the contrary the numerically-estimated pore pressure in the center-south profile is lower than the graphically-estimated one (it ranges between 0.7 and 0.75) -in this case the numerically-estimated taper angle is lower than the measured one-.\nWe documented above that most structures in the lower continental slope are still active, whereas many structures in the upper continental slope are inactive (Fig. 12). Thus, if the present-day conditions remain constant, as the wedge advances seawards and involves undeformed rocks in the Colombian Basin, a new active lower continental slope may develop eastwards. As a consequence, the present-day, active, lower continental slope might become the inactive upper continental slope in the future, and the present-day, inactive, upper continental slope will become part of the continental shelf. If correct, the graph in Fig. 17 might illustrate the path of the taper angle of the present-day lower continental slope over time in each of the profiles across the belt. Except for the south section where there is no lower continental slope and most structures are inactive, and therefore, we are unable to predict its future evolution, the internal pore pressure of the wedge will decrease from values around 0.65\u20130.7 to values around 0.5\u20130.55 (black dashed arrows in Fig. 17). The manner in which pore pressure decreases will be related to the wedge geometry is different along strike. The internal pore pressure decrease in the central part of the wedge will be high (approximately from 0.15 to 0.2 units) and will be accompanied by a decrease in the seafloor slope and an increase in the basal detachment dip. The internal pore pressure decrease in the north portion of the wedge will be small (0.1 unit) and will go along with a decrease in the seafloor slope while the basal detachment dip will remain constant. As a result, both the taper angle and the internal pore pressure of the different along-strike regions of the SFB will become more similar.\nThree types of regions are recognized in the SFB continental slope based on the spatial variations of the taper angle (Fig. 14) and the internal pore pressure (Fig. 18\n). a) A region with relatively high values of taper angle and internal pore pressure is restricted to the lower continental slope in the center-south part of the SFB. b) Two regions with intermediate values of taper angle and internal pore pressure occupy the lower continental slope in the north and center-north part, as well as the upper continental slope in the south part of the belt. c) A region with relatively low values of taper angle and internal pore pressure is restricted to most of the upper continental slope except for the southernmost part. The maps in Figs. 14 and 18 show that the differences between the taper angle and internal pore pressure in the upper continental slope and those in the lower continental slope are maxima in the center-south part of the belt and decrease northwards where both values approximate each other.\n\n\n10.4\nRelationships between pore pressure and sediment thickness\nAs we will see below, some structural and bathymetric differences have been recognized in the SFB continental slope from north to south, however, the greatest difference corresponds to the sediment thickness (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). This is why we suggest that sediment thickness may be one important controlling parameter of pore pressure variations.\nThe pore pressure in the lower continental slope is higher than in the upper continental slope (Figs. 17 and 18). Thus, the degree of compaction of the sediments in the upper continental slope is greater, because the greater grain packaging the larger fluid loss and the larger pore pressure reduction. This is consistent with the fact that the stratigraphic succession prior to the SFB formation, as well as the succession coeval to the SFB formation, is substantially thicker in the upper continental slope than in the lower continental slope (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) (Fig. 10). Perhaps the fact that the structures in the upper continental slope are generally older than those developed in the lower continental slope (Fig. 12), has favored an additional compaction due to tectonic load, which has taken place to a much lesser extent in the lower continental slope (Fig. 10).\nThe pore pressure in the upper continental slope is similar in the north, center-north and center-south profiles, whereas it is higher in the south profile (Figs. 17 and 18). The main along-strike stratigraphic difference in the upper continental slope is the lesser thickness of strata deposited before the development of the SFB in the southern part (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) which probably suffered little compaction, i.e., the pores were hardly modified and little fluid was expelled. The high and fast sediment supply in this region during the SFB development (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021) may have caused a load increase on uncompacted sediments with open pores preventing fluid scape (e.g., Saffer and Bekins, 2006; Shi and Wang, 1985) leading to a pore pressure increase. The presence of more mud diapirs in the south portion of the upper continental slope (Fig. 3) supports the hypothesis of a higher pore pressure.\nThe pore pressure in the lower continental slope is similar in the north and center-north profiles, whereas it is much higher in the center-south profile (Figs. 17 and 18). The main along-strike stratigraphic difference in the lower continental slope is the extremely thinner sedimentary succession in the center-south profile with respect to the rest of profiles (Fig. 4 in Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2021). Similarly to the southern part of the upper continental slope, the thin sedimentary succession previous to the SFB formation probably suffered little compaction. Thus, the fast deposition of sediments synchronous to the SFB formation above poorly compacted sediments caused a notable increase in pore pressure in the center-south region.\n\n\n10.5\nDiscussion on the taper angle analysis\nThe taper angle analysis performed above assumes an approximate homogeneous wedge, with basal pore pressure, and coefficients of internal and basal friction being constant everywhere, and admits that the variation in pore pressure in the wedge relative to the basal pore pressure can reach a 10%. No significant differences between the pore pressure in the wedge and the pore pressure at the detachment have been considered due to the reasons below.\n\na)\nThe equality between pore pressures in the wedge and at the detachment is supported by measurements taken in some wedges such as Taiwan (Suppe and Wittke, 1977), as well as by successful analyses of the taper angle in Taiwan (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990; Dahlen et al., 1984), Barbados (Davis et al., 1983; Dahlen, 1990), and other belts such as the Himalayas, Japan, Peru, Java, Sunda, Guatemala, Aleutians, Oregon, and Makran (Davis et al., 1983).\n\n\nb)\nIn all the analyses of the SFB taper angle carried out up to date (Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015) the pore pressures in the wedge and at the detachment are considered to be equal. Thus, we have followed this assumption suggested by other authors.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, we are aware that, for example, in the Nankai accretionary wedge, the fluid pressure in the wedge is lower than at the basal detachment. Thus, the pore pressure measured within the wedge is 0.58 (Kitajima et al., 2017), whereas the pore pressure near the megathrust fault at the base the wedge reaches approximately 0.85 (Kitajima and Saffer, 2012), so that its variation is slightly greater than 30%. Thus, in order to explore more possibilities in the SFB, we have relaxed the conditions; we have eliminated the limits to the difference between the values of pore pressure in the wedge and at detachment, and between the values of the coefficient of friction in the wedge and at detachment, as long as the theory is fulfilled, i.e., the wedge pore pressure must be equal to or less than the detachment pore pressure, and the wedge coefficient of friction must be equal to or greater than the detachment coefficient of friction. We have looked for those combinations of values whose: a) taper angle obtained is equal to that measured in the seismic profiles or whose difference is less than 0.838\u00b0 and 0.867\u00b0 in the lower and upper continental slope respectively, b) the basal detachment strength and the wedge strength obtained for the lower continental slope are equal to the values obtained using Suppe (2007) best-fit function or their difference is less than 0.04 and 0.3 respectively, and c) the values of the pore pressure and coefficients of friction obtained for the lower and upper continental slopes are as similar as possible. The result obtained is the same as with the more restrictive conditions. This means that the results obtained in relation to these parameters do not depend on the starting assumptions used regarding the limits imposed to the difference between the pore pressures at the wedge and at the detachment, and the coefficients of friction at the wedge and at the detachment.\nIn order to estimate the pore pressure, friction and strength values from the taper angle analysis, we have assumed that the four cross sections presented have reached a critical taper state. However, this might not be the case in the particular situations listed below.\n\na)\nAccording to our results there is higher pore pressure in the lower continental slope relative to the upper slope in the center-south, center-north and north profiles across the belt (Figs. 17 and 18). Another possibility is that the lower continental slope is subcritical and has not reached the critical taper yet. Consistent with this is the fact that this is the area of active deformation with thrusts breaching the seafloor (Fig. 12), and therefore, thickening this part of the wedge.\n\n\nb)\nOur results point out that the pore pressure in the upper continental slope is higher in the south profile than in the rest of profiles (Figs. 17 and 18). This region is the least deformed (Fig. 4), however, one would expect the opposite considering the higher pore pressure. As mentioned in a section above, the occurrence of a thick Pliocene-Quaternary succession all along the south profile may suggest an increased sediment supply by the Atrato River. Because of increased sediment, the taper could be maintained, or even be supercritical, without internal tectonic thickening. This could explain why this section is less deformed despite having a higher pore pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\nAseismic subduction and trench absence\nThe SFB has been interpreted as the front of the westernmost portion of an accretionary prism, known as South Caribbean Deformed Belt, developed as a consequence of the subduction of the Caribbean tectonic plate underneath the South American tectonic plate. This region exhibits at least two peculiarities with respect to other subduction zones: low seismicity related to the subduction zone and absence of a trench near the deformation front.\nAccording to available earthquake catalog compiled by the Arcila Rivera (2018), there have been very few earthquakes in the study area from 1610 to 2014, and their hypocenters are located at depths relatively close to the boundary between the subducting and the overriding plates. Given that the SFB slip rate calculated above is small (average shortening rate in the overriding plate from 3 to 5\u00a0mm\/yr, and average rate of basal detachment displacement from 6 to 17\u00a0mm\/yr) and that young sediments (Pliocene and Quaternary), probably under-compacted and with a high porosity, subduct, this may prevent brittle shear localization. This probably reduces the width of the seismogenic zone resulting in aseismic subduction (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Toto and Kellogg, 1992; Zhang et al., 1993).\nThe geological interpretation of the seismic profiles shows no trench separating the subducting and overriding tectonic plates (Fig. 4). The absence of a trench could be explained as the result of a very slight bending of the subducting plate as shown by the gentle dips of Colombian Basin reflectors in this region (Fig. 4). The reason for this gentle bending is that the Caribbean Plate subducts with a very low dip under the South American Plate (e.g., Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015). Moreover, very few normal faults were active in the Colombian Basin during the development of the SFB (Fig. 3) and their displacement was very small indicating a small amount of extension. Assuming that these faults developed as a consequence of the flexure in the outer part of the lithospheric flexure hinge, this also supports a gentle bending of the subducting plate.\n\n\n12\nMorphostructural zoning\n\n12.1\nAcross strike regions\nThe study area displays variations from northwest to southeast, i.e., perpendicularly to the SFB trend, in terms of bathymetry, stratigraphy and tectonics. Thus, apart from the portion of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB, three regions have been identified within the SFB: a) the lower continental slope, b) the upper continental slope, and c) the continental shelf. The principal characteristics of these zones are illustrated in Fig. 19\n and mentioned in Table 2\n, and their main differential features are described below from the outer to innermost zones using our own data and data from Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021).\n\n12.1.1\nColombian Basin versus SFB\nThe Colombian Basin, developed in the abyssal plain, is located in front of the SFB. The SFB deformation front, which coincides with a slope change, separates it from the SFB, developed in the continental slope, the continental shelf and the onshore area (Figs. 3, 4, 11 and 13). The seafloor in the Colombian Basin is sub-horizontal to gently inclined to the NW (0.3\u20131.4\u00b0) and very regular because only few isolated faults and folds exhibit bathymetric expression, while the seafloor in the SFB reaches greater dips and may be very irregular (Figs. 4, 11 and 13). The Colombian Basin is constituted by a thin succession of Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata over Jurassic rocks, whose thickness increases towards the SFB, while the SFB is made up of a thicker Cenozoic succession which also thickens landwards (Fig. 4). In general, most of the Cenozoic strata are undeformed in the Colombian Basin, while they are quite deformed in the SFB (Fig. 4). Normal faults developed during Cretaceous-Paleocene time, some of them affecting Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata, and some of them reactivated as normal faults during recent times, are the most common structures in the Colombian Basin (Figs. 3\u20135). On the contrary, thrusts and related folds, tear faults, different types of normal faults and mud diapirs occur within the SFB. Tectonic subsidence was fast during Paleocene both in the Colombian Basin and in the SFB, and slow during Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, although it increases towards the SFB (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d). Moderate tectonic subsidence occurred during Pliocene and Quaternary in the Colombian Basin, while slow tectonic subsidence and fast tectonic uplift occurred in the SFB.\n\n\n12.1.2\nSFB lower continental slope\nThe lower continental slope is the most external zone of the SFB. A slope change constitutes the boundary between the lower continental slope and the upper continental slope (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). In this area, the seafloor is the most inclined and irregular of the entire SFB, because many structures are still active (Figs. 11\u201313). This region is formed by the thinnest Cenozoic succession of the SFB (Figs. 4 and 10). Structures such as backthrusts and related folds, continental-slope normal faults with associated toe thrusts, and normal faults reactivated as reverse faults including related folds only occur in this domain (Figs. 3 and 4). The average thrust spacing is intermediate between that of the upper continental slope and that of the continental shelf. Both the thrust dip and displacement are the smallest ones of the entire SFB. The Pliocene-Quaternary piggy-back, syn-tectonic basins related to fold growth and thrust emplacement are the shallowest and narrowest. The dip of the basal detachment, where thrusts branch at depth forming an imbricate thrust system, the depth to the basal detachment, the wedge vertical thickness and the vertical tectonic thickness compared to the original stratigraphic thickness are the smallest of the whole SFB (Figs. 4, 10 and 13). The slowest Eocene-Miocene and Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence and the slowest Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift of the whole SFB occurred in this region (Fig. 9e, 9f, 9g and 9h). Both the taper angle and the internal pore pressure are the highest of the entire SFB (Figs. 14, 15, 17 and 18, and Table 1).\n\n\n12.1.3\nSFB upper continental slope\nThe upper continental slope is the intermediate zone of the SFB. The shelf break, which is a slope change, separates the upper continental slope from the continental shelf (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). The seafloor dips less and exhibits less irregularities than the lower continental slope but it dips more and is more irregular than the continental shelf, since some structures developed near the upper-lower continental slope boundary are still active (Figs. 11\u201313). The Cenozoic strata that constitute this region exhibit intermediate thicknesses between those of the lower continental slope strata and those of the continental shelf strata (Figs. 4 and 10). The most important out-of-sequence thrusts occur in this region and constitute the boundary between the upper and the lower continental slopes. The average thrust spacing is the smallest one of the study area (Figs. 3 and 4). Both the thrust dip and displacement are the highest ones. The depth and width of the Pliocene-Quaternary piggy-back, syn-tectonic basins related to folds and thrusts are intermediate in between those of the lower continental slope and those in the continental shelf. The thrusts branch at depth with the basal detachment forming an imbricate thrust system, and the dip of the detachment is the steepest one. The depth to detachment, the wedge vertical thickness, and the vertical tectonic thickness versus the stratigraphic thickness are intermediate values in between those of the lower continental slope and those of the continental shelf (Figs. 4, 10 and 13). Intermediate Eocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence and intermediate Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift between those of the lower continental slope and those of the continental shelf occurred in this region. The taper angle and the internal pore pressure are the smallest of the SFB (Figs. 14, 15, 17 and 18, and Table 1).\n\n\n12.1.4\nSFB continental shelf\nThe continental shelf is the most internal zone of the SFB (Figs. 3, 11 and 13). The seafloor is the less inclined and most regular of the SFB, since most structures are inactive (Figs. 11\u201313). This domain is made up by the thickest Cenozoic succession of the SFB (Fig. 4). Most the mud diapirs and shale cored anticlines with crestal normal faults, and continental-shelf normal faults, some of them reactivated as reverse faults or as normal faults several times, only occur in this domain (Figs. 3 and 4). The average thrust spacing is the largest one. The Pliocene-Quaternary basins filled in with young syn-tectonic strata are the deepest and widest of the entire SFB. The dip of the basal detachment, from which thrusts emanate, the depth to the basal detachment, the wedge vertical thickness, and the vertical tectonic thickness versus the stratigraphic thickness are the greatest of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13). The fastest Eocene-Miocene tectonic subsidence and the fastest Pliocene and Quaternary tectonic uplift of the entire SFB occurred in this region (Fig. 9i, 9j, 9k and 9\u00a0l).\n\n\n\n12.2\nAlong strike regions\nApart from variations from the external to the internal zones of the belt, there are also along-strike changes, i.e., from southwest to northeast, in terms of characteristics of the structures, as well as stratigraphic and bathymetric features. The belt could be divided into three different regions: a) a south region, which is the south salient under the influence of the Uramita Fault; b) a central region, which is the proper SFB s.s.; and c) a north region under the influence of the Magdalena Fan and Canoas Oblique Ramp. The most important characteristics of these zones are illustrated in Fig. 20\n and presented in Table 3\n, and their main differential features are described below from south to north using our own information plus Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2021) data.\n\n12.2.1\nSouth salient influenced by the Uramita Fault\nThis region corresponds to the south part of the SFB; an entrant separates it from the SFB s.s. to the north, and the Uramita Fault separates it from the North Panama Belt to the south (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). This portion of the belt is narrower than the SFB s.s. but similar to the north region. Unlike the rest of zones, only upper continental slope occurs in this region. The dip of the seafloor in the continental shelf is the lowest of the entire SFB, whereas that of the portion of the Colombian Basin just in front of this region is the highest (Table 3). The bathymetry of the continental slope is the most regular of the belt suggesting almost no recent tectonic activity (Figs. 11 and 12). The Cretaceous-Miocene strata exhibit an intermediate thickness in the frontal part and the highest near the shelf break, so that the 2\u00a0km difference between both thicknesses is intermediate (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the sedimentary succession that fills in piggy-back basins is the thickest one. The vertical thickness of the wedge in the deformation front is the highest, whereas in the shelf break is the lowest, and therefore, the vertical thickness in the shelf break is almost 1.5 times that of the deformation front, i.e., the lowest of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening, i.e., the vertical thickness minus the stratigraphic sequence thickness, is also the lowest. The basal detachment exhibits the highest dip beneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is intermediate and the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is the lowest, thus the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is slightly more than 1 time that beneath the deformation front, being the lowest ratio of the entire SFB. Thrusts and thrust-related folds exhibit an approximately N\u2013S strike, and their average spacing in the deformation front is the lowest together with that of the SFB s.s., whereas in the shelf break is the highest (Fig. 3). The variation between the thrust spacing in the deformation front and in the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, is the smallest one of the whole SFB. An intermediate number of tear faults and mud diapirs with related crestal normal faults and folds occur in this region, while the number of continental-shelf normal faults is the lowest (Fig. 3). The deformation front in the south salient is made up of large detachment folds and a few, minor WNW-directed thrust faults emanating from the basal detachment (seaward-vergent structures) (Fig. 4). The shortening measured here is the smallest of the entire SFB. Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic uplift in the deformation front occurred in this region in contrast to the tectonic subsidence occurred in the other regions; the uplift in the continental shelf is an intermediate value. Thus, this region exhibits the most similar behavior between the deformation front and the shelf break in terms of subsidence\/uplift because uplift has taken place at both sites (Fig. 9). The taper angle measured in the upper continental slope (Figs. 14 and 15) and the pore pressure value estimated in the upper continental slope are the highest ones of the whole belt (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n12.2.2\nSFB s.s\nThis region is the central portion of the SFB separated by a gradual boundary with the north part of the belt, and by an inlet from the south salient (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). The SFB s.s. is the widest portion of the belt. The ratio between the width of the upper continental slope and that of the lower continental slope is extremely variable from less than 1 to 6 times the width of the lower continental slope. The dip of the lower continental slope seafloor may be up to 4 times that of the upper continental slope. The dip of the continental shelf is intermediate between that of the north and south regions, and that of the Colombian Basin in front of this region is the lowest (Table 3). The degree or irregularity of the bathymetry of the continental slope is intermediate in between that of the north and south regions (Figs. 11 and 12). The thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene strata in the frontal part is the lowest and it is intermediate near the shelf break, so that the difference between both thicknesses from 3 to 5\u00a0km is the highest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the succession that fills in piggy-back basins is the thinnest one of the whole SFB. The wedge vertical thickness in the deformation front is the lowest and is intermediate in the shelf break, and therefore, the wedge vertical thickness in the shelf break ranges from almost 2.5 to slightly more than 3 times that of the deformation front, and is the most pronounced ratio of the entire SFB (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening is intermediate. The basal detachment dip beneath the lower continental slope is the lowest one of the entire SFB, but increases to the highest values beneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is the lowest and the depth beneath the shelf break is intermediate; the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is from almost 1.5 times to almost 2 times higher than that beneath the deformation front, being the highest ratio of the entire SFB. The strike of the thrusts and related folds is NNE-SSW, and their average spacing around the deformation front is the lowest together with that of the south region, whereas in the shelf break is the lowest (Fig. 3). The 1\u20132\u00a0km difference between the average thrust spacing in the deformation front versus the one at the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, are the highest ones of the whole SFB. The largest number of tear faults, mud diapirs with related crestal normal faults and shale cored anticlines, and continental-shelf normal faults occur in this region (Fig. 3). The deformation front in the SFB s.s. consists of a symmetrical triangular zone made up of SE-directed thrusts (backthrusts) (landward-vergent structures) in the outer part, and NW-directed thrusts (seaward-vergent structures) in the inner part, all of them emanating from the basal detachment. In some portions of the SFB s.s., the deformation front is a poorly developed triangular zone formed by an imbricate thrust system with sporadic backthrusts (Fig. 4). The shortening measured is the highest of the entire SFB. The maximum amount of tectonic subsidence during Pliocene-Quaternary times in the deformation front occurred in this region together with the north region, and the maximum amount of tectonic uplift in the continental shelf also occurred in this region. Therefore, this region is where the behavior of these two sites in terms of tectonic subsidence\/uplift is the most different (Fig. 9). The taper angle in both the upper and the lower continental slopes are the lowest, and the 1.4\u00b0\u20132.7\u00b0 difference between both taper angles is the highest one of the entire SFB (Figs. 14 and 15). The value of pore pressure in the upper continental slope is the lowest and is the highest in the lower continental slope; thus, the 0.15\u20130.2 difference between both values is the highest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n12.2.3\nRegion influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp\nThis region is the northern part of the SFB, whose boundary to the north is the Magdalena Fan and the Canoas Oblique Ramp, while its southern boundary with the SFB s.s. is diffuse (Figs. 3 and 20 and Table 3). The width of this part of the belt is smaller than that of the SFB s.s. but similar to that of the south salient. The width of the upper continental slope is more than 2.5 times that of the lower continental slope. The dip of the lower continental slope seafloor is from 2.5 to 3.5 times that of the upper continental slope. The dip of the continental shelf is the highest of the whole SFB, whereas that of the Colombian Basin in front of this region is intermediate (Table 3). The bathymetry of the continental slope is the most irregular of the SFB suggesting a lot of recent tectonic activity (Figs. 11 and 12). The thickness of the Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary pile is the highest in the frontal part and the lowest in the shelf break, and therefore, the 0.5\u00a0km difference between both thicknesses is the lowest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 4 and 10), whereas the thickness of the strata that fill in piggy-back basins is intermediate. The wedge vertical thickness in the deformation front is intermediate and is the highest in the shelf break, and thus, the wedge vertical thickness in the shelf break is 2 times that of the deformation front, which is an intermediate value between that of the SFB s.s. and that of the south salient (Figs. 4 and 13), and the vertical tectonic thickening is the highest of the SFB. The basal detachment exhibits the highest dip underneath the lower continental slope which becomes the lowest underneath the upper continental slope (Figs. 4 and 13). The depth to detachment beneath the deformation front is intermediate and that beneath the shelf break is the highest, and therefore, the depth to detachment beneath the shelf break is almost 1.5 times that beneath the deformation front, being this an intermediate value. The strike of the thrusts and related folds is approximately NE-SW, and their average spacing measured near the deformation front is the highest, whereas around the shelf break is intermediate (Fig. 3). The 1.5\u00a0km difference between the thrust spacing in the deformation front and in the shelf break, as well as the number of thrusts, are intermediate values. Tear faults are almost non-existent. The lowest number of mud diapirs including crestal normal faults and folds, and an intermediate number of continental-shelf normal faults, occur in this region. Several structures branch northwards with the Canoas Oblique Ramp (Fig. 3). The deformation front is an asymmetrical triangular zone because the outermost part of the deformation front consists of a SE-directed thrust (backthrust) and a thrust that branches with the backthrust forming a pop-up, whereas the innermost part of the deformation front is made up of NW-directed thrusts (seaward-vergent structures), all of them emanating from the basal detachment (Fig. 4). The shortening measured is an intermediate value. The maximum amount of tectonic subsidence during Pliocene-Quaternary in the deformation front occurred in this region together with the SFB s.s. region, whereas the minimum amount of tectonic uplift in the continental shelf occurred here as well. Thus, the behavior of the deformation front compared to that of the shelf break in terms of tectonic subsidence\/uplift is intermediate (Fig. 9). The taper angle measured in the upper continental slope is intermediate, whereas in the lower continental slope is the lowest, and thus, the 1.3\u00b0 difference between taper angles is the smallest one of the entire SFB (Figs. 14 and 15). The value of estimated pore pressure in the upper continental slope is intermediate and is the lowest in the lower continental slope; the 0.1 difference between both values is the smallest one of the whole SFB (Figs. 17 and 18).\n\n\n\n\n13\nConclusions\nThe post-Jurassic evolution of the Colombian Basin adjacent to the SFB consisted of a Cretaceous-Paleocene extensional event with considerable tectonic subsidence, followed by a slower subsidence event of Eocene-Miocene age during which some normal faults were still active. During Pliocene-Quaternary, the SFB development caused a lithospheric flexure of the Caribbean Plate, accompanied by normal reactivation of previous faults (i.e., flexural extension), which induced high tectonic subsidence in the Colombian Basin.\nThe SFB was initiated by the beginning of Pliocene in the study area and is still active today at a rate of several millimeters per year. The SFB resulted mostly from horizontal motion, mainly displacement along the basal detachment as well as some overriding plate shortening, accompanied by a minor component of vertical motion responsible for tectonic uplift and thickening. The number of active thrusts and related folds increases from the trailing part of the belt to the deformation front supporting a forward propagation sequence. It also varies along strike from the almost inactive salient in the south portion of the belt to the active continental slope in the north part, suggesting a possible slight clockwise rotation of the subducting Caribbean Plate or a possible increased sediment influx due to the Atrato River in the south part of the belt inhibiting structure activity. The SFB can be considered as an approximately homogeneous wedge whose basal pore pressure, and coefficients of internal and basal friction are roughly constant everywhere, whereas the pore pressure is lower in the upper continental slope causing a lower taper angle in the upper continental slope than in the lower continental slope. The small motion rate of the belt and the subduction of highly porous sediments caused an aseismic subduction, and the gentle flexure of the subducting plate prevented the development of a trench. The longitudinal and transversal variations in terms of bathymetry, stratigraphy and structure have allowed us to divide the SFB in three morpho-structural regions across strike: lower continental slope, upper continental slope and continental shelf, and three regions along strike: north region influenced by the Magdalena Fan\/Canoas Oblique Ramp, SFB s.s. and south salient influenced by the Uramita Fault.\nInterpreting seismic profiles across the SFB from the geological point of view with the aid of well logs, quantifying amounts of shortening and basal detachment displacement, carrying out a backstrippping analysis in order to quantify tectonic subsidence\/uplift and vertical tectonic thickening, relating the morphological features to the underlying structure, quantifying the taper angle and their causal parameters in different portions of the belt, as well as establishing a SFB zoning both along and across strike, have proven to be efficient strategies to gain insight into the large-scale structure and evolution of the SFB. These aspects are not only important from the purely scientific point of view but also from the industry point of view because they may be a valuable tool to improve the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons recently reactivated in his region (see Reuber et al., 2021). For instance, the large-scale analysis of the SFB carried out here, especially with regard to tectonic subsidence\/uplift and tectonic thickening, may be useful in obtaining burial data, and therefore, could help in establishing the hydrocarbon generation and migration. In addition, the large-scale history of SFB presented here may serve as analogue for other submarine regions developed under a similar tectonic setting but whose available data are scarcer or of poorer quality.\n\n","11":"","12":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSedimentary basins host significant geological resources including fossil fuels and potential CO2 storage sites. For structural traps associated with these, faults are often important features for seal integrity. For CO2 storage sites in particular, identifying detection and resolution thresholds for gas seeps along faults is of vital importance for site integrity and monitoring.\nFault zones comprise heterogeneous, tabular bodies of rocks that have altered properties compared to the host-rock, from either strain or diagenetic effects. Outcrop studies document faults as narrow, high-strain fault cores with one or several slip surfaces that accumulate most of the throw. The fault core is surrounded by a halo of discrete structures (e.g., fractures and deformation bands) in low-strain damage zones (Fig. 1\n; Wibberley et al., 2008; Braathen et al., 2009; Childs et al., 2009; Fossen, 2010; Torabi et al., 2020).\nDetection and resolution limits in seismic imaging of faults rarely allow identification of this subdivision, although amplitude changes associated with fault zones have been attributed to strained rock volumes (Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Alaei and Torabi, 2017). The limitations in detectability, illumination and resolution cause uncertainties and pitfalls regarding fault geometries (Bond, 2015; Schaaf and Bond, 2019; Michie et al., 2021; Faleide et al., 2021). Such uncertainties are well illustrated by synthetic seismic sections based on simple geological models. To further our understanding of subsurface faults we have to establish and test more realistic models of fault architecture and properties, including deformation zones.\nThe fundamental question addressed by this study is: to what degree detailed fault architectures and gas seeps can be detected and resolved in seismic data? As a baseline case, a high-resolution P-Cable dataset (Planke et al., 2009, 2010) from the Hoop area in the SW Barents Sea is used, which hosts a well-imaged fault forming the basis for a fault model guided by the findings of Faleide et al. (2021). It is worth noting that the present study has a generic focus, and is not a case study of the geological evolution of the Hoop area. The baseline model for this study, M1, consists of a fault (F2 from Faleide et al., 2021) that lacks a damage zone. The baseline fault model is further developed into five alternative models (M2-M6) by incorporating features known from outcrops (e.g., Schueller et al., 2013; Ogata et al., 2014). These include a more realistic fault architecture characterized by a damage zone with deformation bands and fractures dependent on varying clastic lithologies as well as the presence of a fracture corridor (Fig. 1).\nAs an important step towards seismic monitoring of CO2 storage, we introduce gas\/CO2 in potential reservoirs and along the fault and fracture corridor to see the effects in the seismic imaging. Each model forms the basis for 2D point-spread function (PSF)-based seismic convolution modelling (Lecomte et al., 2015) to systematically explore how seismic reflection data, both high-resolution and conventional, image such structures. The seismic modelling tests detection and resolution thresholds for the observation of various fault architectures and gas seepage along these realistically designed faults and allows for the identification of subtle signature-changes attached to fault architecture and gas saturation.\nFurthering our understanding of the ability to image the complexity of fault zones, distribution and composition of the damage zone and identification of potential fluid pathways within them is important for site verification. It is also useful for improving the general understanding of limitations and pitfalls in fault interpretation, thereby potentially contributing to economic de-risking and more sustainable usage of resources.\n\n\n2\nData and geological setting\nThe seismic data guiding the fault models are from the eastern flank of the Hoop Fault Complex, offshore in the Barents Sea, more specifically around the Gemini North well (Fig. 2\n). In this area, Faleide et al. (2021) performed a detailed study of two normal faults (F1 and F2 in Fig. 2c), addressing objective and subjective uncertainties associated with seismic interpretation of faults. In this study, the focus is restricted to fault F2 (Fig. 2c\u2013e).\nThe baseline model in this study (i.e., a fault without a damage zone, M1), builds on interpretations of fault F2 on a WNW-ESE seismic section in the HR14_3D_HFCE1 high-resolution P-Cable seismic volume (Figs. 2e and 3\n) by a test panel with different geological backgrounds, as presented and analysed in Faleide et al. (2021). The high-resolution seismic cube overlap with a conventional seismic cube (Fig. 2b). The P-Cable 3D from 2014 (TGS, WGP and VBPR) has a bin size of 4.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.25\u00a0m, whereas the conventional 3D survey from 2012 (TGS) offers a bin size of 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a018.75\u00a0m. Both seismic datasets have zero-phase polarity, and peaks corresponding to an increase in acoustic impedance are represented as red. The dominant frequency is 150\u00a0Hz (P-Cable) and 40\u00a0Hz (conventional), corresponding to a vertical seismic resolution of about 5\u00a0m and 20\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 2d and e).\nStratigraphy and related elastic properties are constrained from well 7325\/4\u20131 (Gemini North; Fig. 4\n). The gamma ray (GR), photoelectric factor (PEF) and combined density\/neutron porosity logs are used for lithology prediction (Figs. 3b and 4). 1D synthetic seismic traces are created based on the sonic and density logs. For the intervals where density log values are missing, a pseudo-density log is estimated based on standard velocity-density relationships. The time\/depth relations measured in the well provide seismic velocity information (P-wave velocity, Vp) used for depth conversion (Figs. 3 and 4).\nThe targeted succession of this study consists of the Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group and the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Adventdalen Group (Fig. 4; Worsley, 2008). The Kapp Toscana Group, comprising the Snadd, Fruholmen, Tub\u00e5en, Nordmela and St\u00f8 formations, is dominated by variable mudstones, siltstones and sandstones deposited in pro-deltaic, shallow marine, coastal and fluvial environments (Klausen et al., 2018). The St\u00f8 Formation comprises the most mature and well-sorted sandstones of the succession with reservoir-grade deposits occurring in the fine to medium grained cross-bedded sandstones from upper shore-face deposits (Mendoza et al., 2019) and porosity estimates from logs are 20\u201324% (Farazani, 2017). Shales dominate the overlying Adventdalen Group of Fuglen\/Hekkingen to Kolmule formations, which were deposited during a marine highstand cutting off the supply of coarse clastics (Worsley, 2008). Several intervals consist of organic-rich paper shales deposited in deep marine anoxic conditions with high organic productivity. The uppermost deposits comprise the Quaternary above the Upper Regional Unconformity (URU; Fig. 4) that consists of thick prograding wedges of sheet-like clay-silt and sandstone units, transitioning into glaciomarine deposits in the upper parts (Ottesen et al., 2009).\n\n\n3\nMethods and workflows\n\n3.1\nModel building - input to fault and fracture corridor models\nThe baseline model (Fig. 3) is adopted from Faleide et al. (2021) based on fault interpretation and corresponding traced horizons in high-resolution seismic data belonging to one of their scenarios (2.4) in a study addressing seismic interpretation uncertainties of subsurface faults. In this model the fault is interpreted as a single line in the 2D section. The traced horizons and fault segments are depth-converted according to the two-way travel time (TWT) and average velocity information from the Gemini North well. The depth-converted horizons and faults are exported as an image and imported to a graphics program (in an artboard with a reasonable pixel size relative to the size of the model; preferable 1 px\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0m, corresponding to 1\u00a0m sampling) where they are converted to editable traces. Each layer, 32 in total, is assigned a colour indicative of lithology. Since faults are often represented in seismic data by the displacement of layers\/reflections, and not the fault plane itself, fault picks are removed. The resultant model is exported as a PNG file, ready for input to the seismic modelling software.\nThe stratigraphy is divided into four lithologies; sandstone, shaley sandstone, sandy shale and shale. The boundary between the lithologies is based on the GR log response from the Gemini North well, which covers the whole interval. A sand and shale line are set based on the average values for the layers corresponding to well-known sandstone (St\u00f8 Formation) and shale (Fuglen and Hekkingen formations) units (Fig. 4). The sandstone layers in the lower St\u00f8 Formation are the reference for clean sand with GR\u00a0=\u00a070 API and PEF\u00a0=\u00a02.25\u00a0b\/electron. The PEF value supports the definition of sand (Mondol, 2015). The sandstone line is set to 75 API, and therefore all layers with GR\u00a0<\u00a075 is defined as sandstone in this study. The shaley Fuglen Formation is the reference for clean shale, with a high GR response around 160\u2013165 API, along with the fine-grained Hekkingen Formation with values of 130\u2013150 API. Based on these formations the shale line is set to 130 API. The high PEF value of 3.46\u00a0b\/electron supports the shale definition (Mondol, 2015). Rock units falling between the sand and shale lines of the GR log are divided into two mixed lithologies, i.e., shaley sandstone with a GR response of 75\u2013102 API and sandy shale with a GR response of 102\u2013130 API. The combined Density\/Neutron log supports the lithology interpretation (Fig. 4).\nThe baseline model (M1) is further developed by incorporating structural features known from detailed studies of outcrops in the field. Such studies have established robust statistical relationships between fault throw, fault core thickness and damage zone width and intensity (e.g., Bastesen et al., 2013; Schueller et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2016; Torabi et al., 2020), allowing conditioning of fault zone architecture in modelling (Braathen et al., 2009). Empirical relationships between fault throws and the width of the damage zone, established by Schueller et al. (2013), have been utilized to make a damage zone for the F2 fault (Fig. 5\n). Their statistical damage zone model is established for highly porous sandstones, but is herein applied to all units irrespective of lithology for simplification. This approach adheres to the conclusion of Torabi et al. (2020) on fault scaling, advocating that damage zones offer similar trends irrespective of lithology and corresponding style of deformation. Further, the width of the damage zone is considered similar for the hanging wall and footwall to the fault.\nDamage zones can be further subdivided into inner and outer zones (Fig. 5b and c), from differences in spatial frequency of structures (e.g., Berg and Skar, 2005). As fault core widths are on the cm-dm scale, they are herein, for practical purposes considered parts of the inner damage zone. The width of the fault damage zone, with subdivision into inner and outer, is determined based on fault throw, which has a maximum of about 60\u00a0m but varies along the F2 fault (Fig. 5b). The corresponding maximum width of the damage zone is about 50\u00a0m. Throw is calculated for each stratigraphic unit (Fig. 5b), guiding damage zone width and subdivisions of structural element intensity as described in Schueller et al. (2013):\n\n(1)\n\n\nW\n1\na\nv\n=\n3.67\n\nT\n0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nW\n5\na\nv\n=\n2.32\n\nT\n0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nW\n10\na\nv\n=\n1.41\n\nT\n0.44\n\n\n\n\nwhere T\u00a0=\u00a0throw in m and Wx\u00a0=\u00a0width in m from the fault core. The x value of 1, 5 or 10 represents the deformation band density reached at the distance Wx from the fault core, either in the footwall or in the hanging wall (Schueller et al., 2013). Inner damage zones are represented by the W10 zone\u00a0=\u00a0W10av (Eq. (3)), whereas outer damage zones are represented by the W1 zone\u00a0=\u00a0W1av (Eq. (1)) \u2013 W10av (Eq. (3)). As the W5 zone (W5av (Eq. (2))) appears narrow in field observations (e.g., the Bartlet Wash Fault; Fig. 1b), this zone has been omitted.\nFracture corridors, as outlined in Ogata et al. (2014) and Gabrielsen and Braathen (2014), appear as damage zones along faults and around fault-tips, thereby corresponding with fault zone strain outlined above. In two models (M5 and M6), one isolated fracture corridor caused by fold-crest dilation or fault-tip process zone, without shear offset of markers (Ogata et al., 2014), is included (Fig. 5). Joints are implemented structures that are distributed as 20 joints (4 joints\/meter) at the maximum width of 5\u00a0m, trailing off towards the tips, as shown in Fig. 5d and e.\n\n\n3.2\nConditioning elastic properties of lithologies and rock damage\nWith implementation of fault damage, elastic parameters (Vp, Vs, density) vary in layers within the damage zone close to the fault (Fig. 5; Table 1\n). Fault strain in clean sandstone is conditioned as deformation bands, whereas shale units host fractures. For mixed, interlayered lithologies, both deformation bands and fractures are applied. Rock properties are influenced by rock strain (dilation or compaction; e.g., Braathen et al., 2020), partly guided by host-rock porosity. High-porosity sandy layers (>12\u201315% porosity) deform by deformation bands, envisioned as cataclastic shear-compaction bands herein (e.g., Fossen et al., 2007, 2018). Damage zone compaction causes a decrease in porosity and a corresponding increase in velocity and density. For lower-porosity units (<15%), such as shales, the damage zone is dominated by fractures. Contrary to deformation bands, fractures dilate rocks, thereby increasing porosity with corresponding decreases in velocity and density (e.g., Sigernes, 2004; Botter, 2016). Furthermore, fluids in fractures impact elastic properties. For instance, when CO2 in gas phase replaces water in the fractures, there will be an additional decrease in Vp (Agofack et al., 2018). In cases of shaley sandstone, deformation is distributed as 2\/3 deformation bands and 1\/3 fractures, compared to sandy shale with 1\/3 deformation bands and 2\/3 fractures.\nBased on the Gemini North well (Fig. 4), average parameter values for each of the 32 layers are calculated (Table A1 in Appendix A). The Vp is determined based on the check-shot time-depth information (Fig. 4). For layers that are not covered by the Vs and density log data, the parameters are calculated based on the interval Vp and Vp\/Vs ratio for the same typical lithology in the model, and the Gardner's rule (Gardner et al., 1974) relating velocity (Vp; m\/s) and density (\n\n\u03c1\n\n; g\/cm3), respectively:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u03c1\n=\n0.31\n\u2217\n\nV\np\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the damage zones, the elastic parameters are adjusted dependant on deformation by fractures or deformation bands, and the distribution of damage (inner and outer damage zone; Table 1 and Table A1 in Appendix A). The effects of deformation are estimated based on values (percentage interval) for maximum decrease and increase of velocity for siliciclastic rocks, based on Botter (2016), Botter et al. (2014, 2016) and references therein. In the models, deformation bands in sandstones cause a 30% increase in Vp and Vs for the inner damage zone and 15% for the outer damage zone. In lower-porosity units with fractures, the predicted decrease in seismic velocity is 40% for Vp and 30% for Vs in the inner damage zone, while Vp and Vs decrease in the outer damage zone by 20% and 15%, respectively. In mixed lithologies (shaley sandstone and sandy shale), the effects between the two end-member type lithologies are scaled. In shaley sandstone, there is a 10% increase for Vp and Vs for the inner damage zone, and a 5% increase for the outer damage zone. For sandy shale, there is a 20% decrease for Vp and a 10% decrease for Vs in the inner damage zone, while Vp and Vs decrease in the outer damage zone by 10% and 5%, respectively. New densities are calculated with Gardner's rule (Eq. (4)) using the new estimated Vp. The values for Vp, Vs and density are presented in Table A1 in Appendix A.\nIf gaseous CO2 (or other gases) migrates along a shallow fault, as expected above c. 800 m depth, with gas replacing water in the fractures, Vp will decrease. An additional \u223c13% reduction of Vp and \u223c1% reduction of Vs were thus included in the models based on Agofack et al. (2018). These values (Table 1) were used to adjust the elastic parameters both in the inner and outer damage zones for all layers assumed to have fractures filled with gaseous CO2.\nThe fracture corridor is divided into 6 intervals (Fig. 5d,e), and the reduction of Vp and Vs is in the range of 40%\u20132% and 30%\u20132%, respectively, taken the maximum reduction from the inner damage zone for the shale and interpolating to zero-reduction (outside the fracture corridor; Table 2\n). Average Vp and Vs from the shale units are used as a basis for the estimation of reduced Vp, Vs and density within the fracture corridor (Table 2).\n\n\n3.3\nSeismic modelling\nThe main steps of the workflow for the 2D PSF-based seismic convolution modelling (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016) are presented in Fig. 6\n and are similar to Faleide et al. (2021). 2D geological models were first created from depth-converted horizons and fault interpretations (Fig. 6a\u2013c). The models are 1500\u00a0m wide and 450\u00a0m high, and the sampling interval is 1\u00a0m horizontally and 0.2\u00a0m vertically. Each layer of the model was then assigned constant elastic parameters (i.e., Vp, Vs and density; Table A1 in Appendix 1) to further calculate the reflectivity using the Zoeppritz equations (Shuey, 1985, Fig. 6d). Given the lack of detailed survey information and a velocity model for the considered data, a simplified and idealized version of the PSF-based convolution modelling is used by directly designing PSFs from a few key parameters (Lecomte et al., 2016). A generic illumination pattern is thus selected, defined by a regular illumination of all reflector dips until a selected maximum (e.g., 0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0 dip range), in addition to an average velocity, an incident angle, and wavelet extracted from the seismic data. Together these are used to generate a so-called PSDM filter (Fig. 6). The PSF is obtained from a Fourier Transform (FT) of that PSDM filter (Fig. 6e) and convolved with the reflectivity model to obtain a synthetic (PSDM-like) seismic image (Lecomte et al., 2015, 2016). The synthetic seismic image (Fig. 6f) corresponding to the input geological model can then be analysed as a function of various wavelets and the other parameters mentioned above.\nIn addition, noise is added to the synthetic seismic sections to make it more realistic. The colored-noise model is generated by convolution of a random white reflectivity model with the same PSF used for the synthetic seismic described earlier, thus reproducing the same (PSDM-like) filtering effect that the geological models receive in the seismic modelling. The reflectivity range of the noise model was scaled according to the reflectivity range of the input geological model to test different signal-to-noise ratios. All synthetic seismic sections, including the noise components, were also amplitude-calibrated so that an input \u2013 single \u2013 horizontal reflector of strength +1 yields a flat reflection with a peak of amplitude +1. With actual data, such amplitude calibration is performed via wavelet estimation for well ties, this to compensate for non-preserved amplitudes due to seismic acquisition, processing and imaging. With the modelling method used here, the seismic amplitudes are constrained from the PSF, which stems itself both from geophysical parameters (e.g., wavelet, incident angle, illumination pattern, etc.; Lecomte, 2008) and from FFT parameters (size and sampling of the imaged area). The single, unit and horizontal reflector test thus allows to compensate for both effects by a simple normalization. This amplitude calibration allows therefore direct comparisons between input reflectivity and seismic amplitudes (using the same absolute scales for display), the latter resulting, however, from various interferences (constructive and destructive) of the seismic signals after (PSDM) migration, including the possible lack of illumination of steep reflectors.\nA powerful tool for comparison and detection of differences in synthetic seismic sections is to make difference plots. Such difference plots help to emphasize changes between gas-filled vs water-filled damage zones and fracture corridors. Another powerful tool is to compare reflectivity and corresponding synthetic wiggle traces for each model, to see if these match or miss-match, and superimpose seismic wiggle traces for two models together to see the difference in response.\nAs shown in Table 3\n, geophysical parameters such as wavelet, incident angle and illumination pattern are varied to, e.g., represent either the conventional or the high-resolution seismic volumes. The wavelets are extracted from the two seismic data types. For the target area around fault F2 (750\u2013850 TWT interval), the dominant frequencies are 40\u201345\u00a0Hz and 90\u00a0Hz, respectively (power spectrum in Faleide et al., 2021). The wavelet corresponding to the high-resolution seismic data is mainly used to generate the synthetic seismic images of all geological models. The incident angle for the long-offset conventional seismic data is set to 20\u00b0, and for short-offset high-resolution data 0\u00b0. The standard geophysical parameters (Table 3) for all models in this study comprise: a 45\u00b0 illumination angle, implying that reflectors dipping between 0 and 45\u00b0 will be illuminated; 0\u00b0 incident angle representing the short-offset high-resolution seismic data, and the wavelet with frequency of 90\u00a0Hz. Two of the models, M2 and M5, are tested with both wavelets and different incident angles (0\u00b0 and 20\u00b0) to illustrate the resolution differences between high-resolution and conventional data. Model M2 is also generated\/tested with different illumination angles: 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 (as the standard parameter for all models) and 90\u00b0 (perfect illumination).\n\n\n\n4\nResults of seismic modelling\nIn total, six geological models (M1-M6) are tested with seismic modelling targeting fault F2 (Figs. 2c, 3a and 7\n). The models are 1500\u00a0m wide, 450\u00a0m high and consist of 32 layers (Figs. 3 and 5). The main fault and horizon\/layer interpretations are similar in all scenarios, and the widths of the inner and outer damage zone are identical for models M2-M6. F2 bifurcates into two segments (F2a, F2b; Figs. 3a and 5a) at around 240\u00a0m depth; below this, the fault has a dip of 45\u00b0. The two segments above, F2a and F2b, have dips of 25\u201335\u00b0 and 40\u201345\u00b0, respectively. F2a terminates within layer 8 whereas F2b extends to the top of the model. Model M1 (the baseline model; based on Faleide et al., 2021) is F2 without a damage zone (Figs. 3b and 7a); model M2 is F2 with damage zone (Fig. 7b); model M3 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 gas in the footwall and hanging wall (Fig. 7c); model M4 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 gas in the footwall (Fig. 7d); model M5 is F2 with damage zone and an isolated fracture corridor away from F2 (Figs. 5 and 7e); and model M6 is F2 with damage zone and CO2 leaking from a sandy reservoir up into the F2a footwall and in the fracture corridor (Fig. 7f). The elastic parameters vary in the layers within the damage zone close to the fault, and within the fracture corridor for the last two models (Tables 1\u20132 and Table A1 in Appendix A).\n\n4.1\nSynthetic seismic sections of the fault models\nIn the high-resolution synthetic seismic section of model M1 (F2 without damage zone; Figs. 3, 7a and 8\na), splaying of the F2-fault into segments F2a and F2b is clearly detectable. Internal layers in the fault block, between F2a and F2b, are also well imaged. According to the geological input model (Figs. 3b and 7a), F2a terminates within layer 8 and F2b penetrates up to URU at the base of layer 2 (Fig. 5). The fault tip of F2a is identified in the synthetic seismic section (#1, Fig. 8a), while the upper fault tip of F2b cannot be identified, thereby deviating from the geological model (#2). F2a is imaged below the fault block (#3), just before F2a and F2b merge. In the high-amplitude peak (red) in the deeper part, the fault plane itself is imaged, in what appears as a dragged reflective layer along the fault (#4).\nIn model M2 (F2 with damage zone; Fig. 7b), the fault is well imaged and both segments F2a and F2b are associated with strong reflections. The termination of F2b around layer 2 and where F2a tips within layer 8, are clearly seen (#5 and #6, Fig. 8b). Overall, there are more disturbances in the fault block between the two segments than outside this block. A smear of the lower boundaries of layers 10 and 14 from the faulted block, across F2b, can be detected in the synthetic seismic section of M2 (#7, Fig. 8b). Furthermore, parts of F2a below branch-point to F2b show enhanced reflections corresponding to the fault envelope having the widest damage zone (50\u00a0m). Near the branch-point, especially in the footwall of F2a, the amplitude is stronger, ascribed to overlapping, and hence, wider damage zones (#8, Fig. 8b). This is the case for models M2-M6, all consisting of an inner and outer damage zone (Fig. 7). The fault plane is imaged as dipping reflection along the entire fault.\nIn model M3 (Fig. 7c), gaseous CO2 fills all fractures in the hanging wall and footwall damage zones. The synthetic seismic section for this model (Fig. 8c) shows that the fault block between F2a and F2b remains discernible. There are weak reflections between the layers 8 and 10, but there is still an offset in top of layer 8 (#9, Fig. 8c). The layers and zones that are filled with gaseous CO2 appear brighter in the synthetic seismic sections (#8, Fig. 8c).\nModel M4 deviates from M3 in that CO2 is only filling the damage zone in the footwall of F2a (Fig. 7d). The synthetic seismic section of M4 (Fig. 8d) mimics that of M3 (Fig. 8c), clearly showing the termination of both F2a and F2b, and a strong amplitude in the F2a footwall (at #8).\nIn model M5, an isolated fracture corridor has been added to M2 east of F2 (Figs. 5a and 7e). This fracture corridor is well imaged in the synthetic seismic section, as a dipping signal modification, imaged as two to three dipping reflections (#10 in Fig. 9\nc) cutting the horizontal layers. In accordance with the geological model, there is no sign of stratigraphic offset.\nModel M6 presents a fault model with damage zone and a fracture corridor similar to M5. In addition, gaseous CO2 is present in the undamaged thickest sandstone layer in the deep parts and with envisioned leaks to the fractures in the F2a footwall damage zone and the fracture corridor (Fig. 7f). The blue reflections (trough) reflect very strong amplitudes in the footwall compared to the hanging wall. In the hanging wall, the same interval appears as two bright reflections with no reflections between them (#11, Fig. 9d). A depression to the right of the fracture corridor in the geological model (Fig. 7e and f), the sandy shale above the deepest and thickest sandstone layer, can be seen as an isolated depression (channel?) in the synthetic seismic section (#12 in Fig. 9b,d).\n\n\n4.2\nComparison of synthetic seismic sections\nIn the synthetic seismic sections for the fault models with damage zone (models M2-M6), the upper part of F2b is better imaged compared to the model without damage zone (M1) for which F2b does not cut layers 3 and 4 (Figs. 8 and 9). The damage zone and the fracture corridor of fault models M2-M6 appear wider in imaged synthetic seismic sections (Figs. 8 and 9) compared to the geological models (Fig. 7). The synthetic seismic results show that the fault appears better imaged in all cases when damage zones are added, mainly driven by stronger amplitudes (#8, Figs. 8 and 9).\nCO2-filled fractures create stronger (high-amplitude) reflections (models M3, M4 and M6; Figs. 8 and 9) as the change in elastic parameters results in larger changes in velocity and density from the undamaged rock to the deformed rock in the damage zones. The model with damage zone and CO2 in both the hanging wall and footwall (M3; Figs. 7c and 8c) shows less disturbance in the fault block between F2a and F2b than the model with damage zone and water-filled fractures (M2; Figs. 7b and 8b), but less internal layers than the model without damage zone (M1; Figs. 7a and 8a). The upper part of F2b has opposite polarity of the reflections (trough\/peak) in M3 compared to M2 and M4, which, in the upper part are similar since the fractures in M4 are filled with gas only in the footwall of F2a (between #9\/7 and #5 in Fig. 8b\u2013d). Fig. 8 also displays reflectivity and seismic wiggle traces for each model in a key location crossing the F2a and F2b and down to the thick sandstone layer (Figs. 3, 5 and 7). Closely spaced events in the reflectivity log compared to the seismic wiggle trace show widespread evidence of interference. Below the dotted line, the trace are the same for models M1-M5, and above the dotted line the wiggles for each model differs from each other. Where the CO2 is present, the amplitudes are stronger (Figs. 8 and 9).\nAt a first glance, the models with damage zones (models M2-M6; Figs. 7\u20139) appear very similar, however, the difference plots and the superposed seismic wiggle traces for the comparisons between two and two models document differences (Figs. 9e and 10\n). Since M2-M4 have the same fault geometry, the changes in seismic response are related to the effect of CO2 (Figs. 8 and 10), and the same is the case for M5 and M6 (Fig. 9e). In the difference plot between M3 and M4, there are two places along the fault zone where they are similar; hence no signal in the difference plots (Fig. 10c). This is where the thickest sandstone layers are present (Fig. 3b), which have no CO2 within the damage zone as they contain no fractures. The effect of injecting CO2 in the undamaged sandstone, the isolated fracture corridor and in the footwall damage zone above the sandstone layer is clearly visible in the difference plot of M5 and M6 (Fig. 9e).\n\n\n4.3\nSensitivity analysis of key geophysical parameters\nThe effects of utilizing different wavelets and incident angles for M2 and M5 are shown in Fig. 11. The synthetic seismic sections emphasize the importance of resolution in conventional and high-resolution seismic datasets; there is more interference of the reflections in the conventional synthetic section (7 reflections in the interval of 90\u2013200\u00a0m, compared to 14 in the same interval for the high-resolution, Fig. 11). In the conventional synthetic seismic the faulted block in between F2a and F2b is not resolved but is indicated by a disturbance (#13, Fig. 11b,d). Further, F2a and F2b are less prominent in the shallow part (above the faults splay around 240\u00a0m), but they can barely be detected at the termination near top layer 3 and at top of layer 8 (#5 and #6 in Fig. 11\nb,d).\nThe damage zone is not that well imaged in the conventional synthetic seismic sections compared to the high-resolution synthetic section, although it is possible to detect and identify the presence of the structure (#8, Fig. 11). The maximum width of the fracture corridor (5\u00a0m) is near the detection threshold for high-resolution data, and below the threshold for conventional seismic data. Despite this, the fracture corridor in M5 is imaged in both the high-resolution and conventional synthetic seismic section (Fig. 11c and d), with the fracture corridor seen as smeared reflections contrasting the surrounding reflective horizons (#10, Fig. 11).\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis of utilizing different illumination angles; 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 (perfect illumination) on M2 are shown in Fig. 12\n. For 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 illumination the fault is well imaged. However, the 30\u00b0 illumination case has problems imaging most of the fault segments.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nFault imaging in seismic data depends on geological constraints, such as truncation and offset of horizons, fault dip, geometry and intrinsic architecture, location of fault tips and process zones, and width and strain of relay ramps (3D aspects). The constraints combined with geophysical limitations (e.g., resolution) hinders fault interpretation. Most studies applying seismic modelling tools have targeted outcrop scenarios (e.g., Anell et al., 2016; Botter et al., 2017; Rabbel et al., 2018; Eide et al., 2018; Lubrano-Lavadera et al., 2018; Wrona et al., 2020). The advantage of using outcrops as conditioning is that they provide a viable geometric model (small details, geometries, segmentations etc.; Fig. 1). Shortcomings of this include the reliance on single unique locations often lacking measured petrophysical parameters. For some outcrops, samples are taken for laboratory petrophysical measurements but still there are uncertainties regarding how relevant these are making synthetic seismic for a subsurface cases. Another approach to building geological models for input to seismic modelling is by using analogue models (Kjoberg et al., 2017) or numerical discrete element models (DEM; Botter et al., 2014, 2016). This study is based on an approach that combines the impact of seismic and sub-seismic structures, such as damage zones, providing a realistic fault model, and has the potential to narrow the gap between seismic and outcrop data. Structural details known from outcrop studies are combined with shallow subsurface geophysical and geological information based on high-resolution seismic data and well data. The Hoop area was selected because of its unique database for such a generic study addressing to what degree detailed fault architectures and gas seeps can be detected and resolved in seismic data.\n\n5.1\nModel building and conditioning\nThe model building in this study with conditioning of the two damage zone bins (inner and outer), with deformation bands and\/or fractures for a combination of mixed lithologies, comes with uncertainties. These uncertainties can partly be ascribed to fault growth mechanisms and rheology (Braathen et al., 2013) and partly to layer mechanics (Ogata et al., 2014; Ferrill et al., 2017). A model forecasting strict boundaries for deformation bands versus fracture damage zones, based in lithology and thereby excluding lithification effects (compaction, cementation), is a simplification. The forecasted changes in density and velocity for the inner and outer damage zone are therefore associated with uncertainties.\nAs the study is not directly based on outcrop data, where deformation features can be characterized in detail (e.g., types of deformation bands and fractures, frequency distribution etc.), simplifications to the models are made (Figs. 5 and 7). These simplifications are justified by the fact that seismic data resolution is below outcrop resolution, limiting what we can interpret from seismic data. The tuning of velocities for this study are literature based conceptual values (Sigernes, 2004; Botter, 2016; Botter et al., 2014, 2016; Agofack et al., 2018) and the density is estimated based on the estimated Vp. The succession was divided into four lithologies, and each layer is considered homogeneous for simplification (same velocity and density within each layer, differences inside and outside the damage zone; Fig. 5, Table 1 and Table A1 in Appendix A).\nThe basic fault model without a damage zone (M1; Figs. 3b and 7a) is based on high-resolution seismic data and hence represents an intermediate resolution case between outcrop and conventional seismic data (higher versus lower resolution, respectively). Design of the detailed models M2-M6 (Figs. 5 and 7) complies with the mentioned outcrop-derived empirical laws and gross geophysical conditioning. A natural next step would be to build and test fault models based on relevant outcrops having better resolution to make more detailed models to avoid the simplifications applied in this study. Ideally, this outcrop should also be sampled for laboratory measurements of key petrophysical parameters.\n\n\n5.2\nSeismic resolution and imaging of detailed fault architecture\nConventional 3D seismic data represent the norm for detailed fault studies in seismic data, while high-resolution P-Cable data still remains rare. The better resolution in the latter, however, allows greater recognition of details, such as subtle fault geometry and architecture. In this study, the P-Cable data achieves 3\u20137\u00a0m vertical resolution, compared to 15\u201325\u00a0m for the conventional seismic data. Structures at or below seismic resolution are clearly detected in the synthetic seismic (e.g., Figs. 8, 9 and 11). The introduction of gas within fractures of the damage zone (Figs. 8 and 10) and in a separate fracture corridor (Fig. 9), enhances the seismic signature of these features even further. These features are clearly detected in the synthetic seismic sections and show that tuning occurs within the limit of visibility (detection) and limit of separability (vertical resolution) in both types of seismic data (Fig. 11). In the high-resolution data, many of the details are resolved.\nThe fault models based on high-resolution seismic data from the Barents Sea provide a unique opportunity to investigate the use of high-resolution P-Cable data and the application of seismic attributes on both seismic data types for improving our capabilities in fault interpretation and gas detection. One limiting factor is that P-Cable data work best above the first seabed multiple in marine seismic data, hence covering the shallow subsurface (Planke et al., 2010; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2018). In the study area, water depths are about 450\u00a0m (600\u00a0ms TWT), allowing high-resolution data down to 1200\u00a0ms TWT (about 900\u00a0m below the seabed). As the targeted faults, analysed herein are shallow (upper 500\u00a0m below the seabed; Fig. 3), attenuation of seismic energy with depth is limited (Brown, 2011). Also, changes in velocities within the studied depth interval appear moderate (2,2\u20133,2\u00a0km\/s; Table A1 in Appendix A), limiting the impact of burial related compaction on velocity (Bj\u00f8rlykke and Jahren, 2015). There is, however, a decrease in dominant frequency down to the targeted geology, from 150\u00a0Hz to 90\u00a0Hz for the high-resolution data, while the conventional data shows minimal changes.\nThe introduced fault architecture adds sub-seismic structures (deformation bands and fractures) that will ultimately affect the seismic image. Strikingly, these added structures show up in the synthetic seismic sections, and are enhanced when introducing gas within fractures of the damage zones and in the fracture corridor (Figs. 8\u201310). Resolution, and hence identification of fault damage zones, is sensitive to velocity. According to Boadu (1997), fracture-induced velocity changes become insensitive to fracture density at higher strains. This sensitivity reflects a shift to domineering fracture properties overshadowing rock properties.\nWhen comparing seismic data to actual geology, it is important to consider the structural geometry in 1:1-scale so that the fault interpretation can be directly compared to faults in outcrop. Seismic sections are indeed often displayed with a high vertical exaggeration, which actually masks the impact of lateral resolution issues, though it is known that lateral resolution (combined with lack of illumination) are worse than the vertical resolution by at least a factor 2. In this study, most of the synthetic seismic sections are displayed in 1:1 scale (e.g., Figs. 8\u201310 and 12).\nSeismic attributes do not change or improve the objective uncertainty. However, they can be applied in various combinations to highlight details not immediately apparent. The time-slices through the variance cube show signal discontinuities up to 60\u201380\u00a0m wide that could reflect faults with damage zones (Fig. 2c). Given the bin size of the high-resolution seismic data, and the corresponding horizontal resolution, these zones have been sampled up to ten times across the fault zone. The results are promising with respect to mapping the widths of damage zones at different depths in the subsurface for deformed sedimentary units, similar to the conclusions drawn by Alaei and Torabi (2017) from a study of conventional seismic data. Of concern is that both the results of this study, along with those of Alaei and Torabi (2017), yield conceivable damage zones that are wider than those predicted by outcrop-based global trend lines. A strength of the seismic data is the 3D control that we usually lack in outcrops.\nThe fracture corridor in the synthetic seismic sections appears similar to features discernible in the shallow subsurface seismic data of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Serck et al., 2017) and the Hoop graben (Fig. 13\n). When interpreting the subsurface seismic data (both areas are covered by conventional 3D seismic data with 2\u00a0ms processing), these features are overlooked as no obvious explanation is available; they are not minor faults as they lack evidence of throw. Notably, they appear strikingly similar to fracture corridors encountered in the synthetic seismic sections, suggesting they represent tabular zones of joints. As they appear in shale-dominated successions, there could be a link to compaction that triggers polygonal faulting.\n\n\n5.3\nDetection of gas\nFaults are often associated with the formation of structural traps, and structural traps can be potential sites for CO2 storage. The lithology, juxtaposition, damage zone and fault-core will determine if a fault zone will be sealing or act as a potential conduit for fluids (e.g., Ogata et al., 2014). Seismic modelling of CO2 migration within a fault zone can provide insight into the detectability and seismic expression associated with such a scenario. This study focused on the detection of shallow CO2 in a gaseous phase, different from the more higher density supercritical state in which CO2 would be injected in a deeper reservoir. This study indicates that CO2 within fault damage zones and fracture corridors creates a significant signal compared to the base case scenario (Figs. 9e and 10) suggesting that it will be possible to monitor and detect CO2 leakage over time at repository locations.\nA powerful tool for comparison and detection of differences in synthetic seismic sections is the application of difference plots, comparing two images that can identify subtle changes in signals. In our analyses, difference plots especially detect alterations between fault zones with a damage zone with and without CO2 (Figs. 9e and 10).\nMonitoring technologies rely on time-lapse comparative seismic to detect changes with time (Arts et al., 2003; Chadwick et al., 2004; Eiken et al., 2011; Furre and Eiken, 2014), much like the difference plots generated here (Figs. 9e and 10). A recent analysis by Waage et al. (2021) suggests P-Cable technologies can serve as a valuable monitoring tool in detecting even small (low percentage saturation) leakages at 30\u2013300 times the detection limit of conventional seismic data. Further study into the limits in detecting different saturation models, with variations in distribution and changes in seismic parameters, would better constrain the threshold for identifying CO2 migration.\n\n\n\n6\nSummary and conclusions\nThis study explores detection and resolution thresholds in synthetic seismic data on fault architecture and gas seeps associated with a shallow fault imaged in P-Cable, high-resolution seismic data. The results are based on a detailed geological model with viable fault architecture including sub-seismic structures of damage zones, which is conditioned by outcrop-based empirical laws for fracture and deformation band distribution. Elastic parameters are conditioned by strain in four lithologies; sandstone, shaley sandstone, sandy shale and shale; in which damage zones of sandstone layers host deformation bands contrary to shale layers with fractures, or a combination of the two. This study utilized a 2D PSF-based seismic convolution modelling to generate PSDM-alike synthetic seismic data, thus including full resolution and illumination effects, though in 2D only due to the input models.\nThe main findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Adding damage zones to the baseline fault model gives rise to stronger disturbances of the seismic signals within a broader zone; (2) High-resolution seismic data have the ability to detect and outline damage zones in the shallow subsurface; (3) An isolated, narrow fracture corridor is clearly visible as dipping reflections crossing the horizons, which shows no stratigraphic offset; (4) CO2-filled fractures in the damage zone and in the fracture corridor give a stronger seismic response than models without CO2; (5) Sensitivity tests show good imaging for illumination \u226545\u00b0, which is the average dip of the main fault segment; (6) These findings offer guidance for seismic monitoring, e.g., building realistic models for seismic modelling simulating time-lapse (4D) seismic in relation to CO2 storage.\n\n","13":"\n\n1\nIntroduction and study area\nThe geology of the Sohar Basin is poorly understood concerning its initiation, basin fill, and tectonostratigraphic history. The key aim of this study is to define the stratigraphy of the Sohar Basin, place it into a tectonostratigraphic framework, and unravel its tectonic history. With this renewed understanding we can now evaluate the northern Sohar Basin's true hydrocarbon prospectivity. The Sohar Basin covers an area of approximately 30,000\u00a0km2 to the east of the Arabian Peninsula. It spans from the Musandam Peninsula of Oman, through the UAE's waters and south into the Oman Sea (Fig. 1\n).\nThe Sohar Basin is located on the northeastern margin of the Arabian Plate, to the east of the Oman Mountains. The basin formed in the Late Cretaceous after the closing of the Tethys Ocean, subsequent obduction of the Semail Ophiolite, and eventual collapse along the mountain belt's eastern margin (Styles et al., 2006, Ravaut et al., 1997; Levell et al., 2021).\nThe basin is located close to the confluence of three major fold and thrust belts, the Oman Mountains to the south and west, the Makran Accretionary Wedge to the east and the Zagros Fold Belt to the north and west (Fig. 1). The Sohar Basin is bound to the south by the Semail Gap in Oman and to the north and west by a basin bounding extensional fault (Ravaut et al., 1998; Levell et al., 2021, Fig. 1). To the northeast of the Sohar Basin, the Zendan-Minab strike-slip fault system (Jahani et al., 2009) runs from north to south marking the southeastern extremity of the Miocene to Pliocene aged Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt (Stoecklin, 1968; Alavi, 1994; Sherkati and Letouzey, 2004) and the western limit of the Makran accretionary prism (Mokhtari et al., 2008). To the west of the Sohar Basin, the Semail Ophiolite forms the spine of present-day Oman Mountains (Glennie, 1974).\n\n\n2\nRegional geology and tectonics\nFrom Mid-Permian to Lower Cretaceous times, the Arabian plate remained at equatorial latitudes allowing for the development of a passive margin (Pilia et al., 2021). At this time the Sohar Basin was not initiated since the in-situ Gulf of Oman Oceanic crust underlies the sedimentary pile that is approximately 80\u2013100Ma. This is inferred from age dating from the Semail Ophiolite onshore as being ca. 95 Ma (Tilton et al., 1981; Tippit et al., 1981) as well as heat flow measurements to the North and East of Ras al Hadd suggesting an age of 70\u2013100\u00a0Ma (White and Ross, 1979; Hutchison et al., 1981, Fig. 1).\nThe Arabian Plate has gradually drifted to the north from equatorial latitudes to its present day position since the Mid Cretaceous (Scotese, 2016, Fig. 2\n) forming a convergent plate boundary at its northeastern margin which lasted from 95 to 75Ma (Glennie et al., 1973; Ali et al., 2013; Searle and Cox, 1999). This led to the formation of two distinct basins on either side of the Oman Mountains, the Suneinah (Aruma) Foreland Basin to the west (Fig. 3\n, Boote et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 2014), and the Sohar \u201cRetro-Foreland\u201d or \u201cHinterland\u201d Basin to the east (Levell et al., 2021; Naylor and Sinclair, 2008).\nThe Sohar basin formed due to the collapse of the Oman Mountains' eastern flank in the late Cretaceous (Styles et al., 2006), this is marked by the presence of an extensional fault along the Sohar Basin's western margin, very close to the present-day coastline of Oman (Levell et al., 2021) and up into the UAE. During this time eustatic seal level fluctuations governed sediment distribution within the basin.\nThis was followed by a period of tectonic quiescence during the Early Cenozoic to the west of the Oman Mountains. Intermittent compression occurred during the Eocene through to Oligo-Miocene when uplift culminated as a result of the opening of the Red Sea and Zagros Orogeny (Searle et al., 2014; Tarapoanca et al., 2010). Structural deformation began in the Sohar Basin during the Eocene, and in some cases major growth faults were inverted in the Miocene as reverse faults (Levell et al., 2021). This led to the formation of anticlinal ridges, defining the geometry of the northern Sohar Basin and the sediments which were deposited within it at this time. Tectonic quiescence from Middle Miocene to present day allowed for the formation of a eustatically controlled margin as well as a prograding delta system.\nThe total sedimentary pile in the Northern Sohar Basin ranges from 0.5 to 10\u00a0km thick and varies in age from Mid-Cretaceous through to the Holocene, whereas, to the south in Oman up to 9\u00a0km of Miocene to Cretaceous sediment has been interpreted from seismic reflection data (Levell et al., 2021). The stratigraphy in the Sohar Basin is predominantly clastic. The source provenance for much of the sediments preserved in the Sohar Basin was the obducted Semail Ophiolite or uplifted Musandam culmination (Levell et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nData availability and methodology\nThe Geophysical dataset consists of both 2D and 3D proprietary seismic, that covers almost the entire study area of 4400km2.. (Fig. 4\n). The two 3D seismic volumes cover a total of nearly 2600\u00a0km2, and were acquired in 2000 and 2012. Additionally six 2D surveys were acquired in the basin between 1974 and 2014 measuring a total of 2551 line kilometres. In particular, the integration of the two 3D surveys and the Multi-Channel Seismic and Wide-Angle reflection data acquired in 2014 (Ali et al., 2020; Pilia et al., 2015, 2020) was paramount in developing the basin framework used in this study.\nA total of three wells have been drilled within the study area to depths of between 3 and 5\u00a0km where biostratigraphy determined the presence of Holocene to Upper Cretaceous aged strata. These three wells also defined seismic to well ties and interpretation of this data indicates that all wells had targeted structural traps.\nTo create a sequence stratigraphic framework, five regional composite seismic sections were interpreted (Fig. 4). From these, the major sequence stratigraphic and kinematic boundaries were picked. This framework was then used to consistently interpret throughout all of the available 2D and 3D seismic in the area of interest. The interpretation was then integrated into a basin modelling study, which was utilised to understand the petroleum systems and prospectivity.\n\n\n4\nMethods\nSeismic interpretation and mapping was completed in the IHS\u2122 Kingdom (2020) software and depth modeling was done using Kingdom's Dynamic Depth Conversion tool. Furthermore, basin modeling was undertaken in Zetaware's Trinity and Genesis software packages and all figures for this publication were drafted in CorelDraw 2019.\n\n\n5\nStratigraphic interpretation\nA series of seismically defined tectono-megasequences were recognised and picked on five regional seismic profiles (Fig. 4). An interpretation of the seismic facies established a regional facies model based on globally accepted models for both carbonate depositional settings and the clastic shelf to slope model of passive continental margins (Steckler et al., 1993). Well data was used to aid in generating facies maps from Eocene to Holocene. Seismic onlap terminations, key unconformities, and tectonic mega-sequences were picked from 5 key regional composite seismic lines across the study area (Fig. 4). Where possible these megasequence boundaries have been tied to the Arabian Plate Sequence Stratigraphic Boundaries of Sharland et al. (2001), and for the shallower sequences to Al-Husseini (2013), to provide a plate scale context. A chronostratigraphic summary chart showing the lithological relationships and chronostratigraphic units is shown in Fig. 5\n\n.\nDeep marine sediments of Mid to Upper Cretaceous age overlie the Oceanic Crust basement (see Fig. 6). It is represented by a succession of deep marine siliceous rocks including shales and radiolarites with interbedded siltstones. This is followed by the deposition of calcareous mudstones equivalent to the Pabdeh formation in the foredeep to the west of the Oman Mountains deposited during the Paleocene to Middle Eocene (Glennie, 1974; Boote et al., 1990\nZiegler, 2001). These are referred to in this study as the \u201cPre-Tectonic units.\"\nIn the Mid Paleogene (Fig. 5), structural deformation ensued, likely in response to the Oman Mountains uplift and subsequent collapse (Styles et al., 2006), and mini sub-basins formed between anticlinal ridges (Fig. 7\n\n and Fig. 9\n). This enabled shallow marine environments to develop on top of structural highs and source rocks to deposit in the restricted depositional lows. These units are referred to as the Syn-Tectonic units and are seismically defined by clear onlap sequences within localised mini-basins bound by structural ridges (see Fig. 8).\nThis tectonic phase was followed by a period of tectonic quiescence and allowed the development of a deltaic system which prograded from west\/northwest to east\/southeast from the Lower Miocene through to the present day. This delta system is comprised purely of clastic sediments transported from the Oman Mountains and the Musandam Peninsula into the Sohar Basin. These units are referred to as the \u201cPost-Tectonic units\".\n\n\n6\nStructure of the northern Sohar Basin\nThe subsurface structure of the Northern Sohar Basin is influenced by both compressional and extensional deformation. The Mid-Eocene to Cretaceous stratigraphy within the pre-tectonic unit is dominated by compressional deformation where a series of eastward verging anticlines have formed in response to westerly dipping reverse faults (Figs. 7 and 9). These thrusts appear to be detaching within less competent shale units of the Lower Tertiary or within units of similar lithology in the Upper Cretaceous (Figs. 6 and 7).\nClear onlaps onto the structures date their uplift as mid to lower Miocene, with some features suggesting movement as early as the Middle Eocene. High amplitude features run along many synclinal axes within the study area (Fig. 9). Clear downlap geometries onto the top of these anomalies indicate deep marine deposits and are likely to be basin floor fans. The anticlines formed basin floor ridges and minibasins during the Eocene to Lower Miocene and determined sediment distribution within the basin at this time (Fig. 9).\nThroughout much of the northern region of the Sohar Basin the Syn and Post Tectonic sections are un-deformed and simply infill or drape over these anticlinal structures (Figs. 8 and 9). Conversely, towards the south of the study area these Syn and Post Tectonic Units are cut by major extensional faults, which in some cases reach to the seafloor and are active at the present day (Fig. 10\n).\n\n\n7\nTectonostratigraphic evolution of the Sohar Basin\nA detailed tectonostratigraphic evolution model for the Sohar Basin is outlined below and is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nIn the Upper Cretaceous, a subduction zone formed and the Neo-Tethys oceanic crust was obducted onto the Arabian Plate's eastern-most continental margin (Glennie et al., 1973). To the west of the mountain belt the Suneinah (Aruma) Basin formed (Boote et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 2014), marked by the onset of clastic deposition into the foreland basin, with shallow marine carbonates being deposited directly onto the uplifted Semail Ophiolite, known as the Simsima formation (Noweir et al., 1998). In the Northern part of the Sohar Basin, similar shallow marine reef deposits were not encountered in the drilled wells but can be expected close to the mountain belt and shoreline.\nDuring the earliest Tertiary, these shallow marine carbonates were deposited close to the shoreline to the South in Oman and are known as the Seeb Limestone (Levell et al., 2021). To the west of the Oman Mountains, the Pabdeh foreland basin began to form. Deep marine shales were deposited in the foredeep and shallow marine carbonates were deposited along the shoreline (Searle, 2019). Today these are known as the Dammam and Umm-er-Radhuma formations (Noweir et al., 1998, Van Dijk, 2020). Within the Sohar Basin, similar strata can be expected within the deep basin, as proven by the drilled wells, and shallow marine facies would have been deposited along the western margin. This depositional setting persisted until the Middle Eocene when deformation commenced marking the end of the Pre-Tectonic phase.\nThe Mid Eocene to Oligocene period began with the onset of tectonic activity within the Sohar Basin. Thrust cored anticlines (Fig. 7) are likely associated with extension at the basin's western margin. This is concurrent with the major phase of deformation to the west of the Oman Mountains (Searle, 2019). This study interprets that the uplift of the Oman Mountains in the late Cretaceous was followed by \u2018post orogenic collapse\u2019, resulting in extension, and gravity-driven toe thrusting in the Sohar Basin.\nUplift along these ridges led to the development of narrow, deep, and isolated sub-basins within the synclines, as well as secluded shallow marine environments developing on the crests of the anticlines. This would have provided both the optimum conditions for preserving organic-rich source rocks in the lows and the growth of pinnacle and fringing reefs along anticlinal ridges forming barrier islands.\nA significant marine regression occurred during the Lower Miocene and the crests of these anticlines became exposed as isolated islands away from the shoreline (Fig. 10). Fringing reefs would likely have formed around the islands' shorelines with associated talus slopes leading into the restricted narrow basins. Sediment shed from the anticline crests was re-deposited as debris flows and flanks and via basin floor fans along north\/south synclinal axes. Towards the coastline, reefs were able to grow due to the limited clastic influx from the hinterland. This phase defined the beginning of the post tectonic stage which is denoted by tectonic quiescence and the formation of the eustatically controlled delta system that persists to the present day.\nDuring the Mid Miocene to Lower Pliocene, a marine transgression occurred and the coastline back-stepped towards the outcropping Semail Ophiolite. There was a significant change in sedimentation in the Sohar Basin as the carbonate factory switched off and clastic sedimentation dominated. As sea level gradually rose, the delta sequences prograded into the basin indicating that sediment supply was more significant than the creation of accommodation space. The sediment deposited in the shelf areas consisted of sands and silts derived from the ophiolite with abundant clasts of mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, as discovered in the drilled wellbores. The anticlines that were uplifted in Lower Tertiary were buried by deep marine pelagics and frequent turbidity flows. This meant that the anticlines uplifted in the previous tectonic stage were still forming bathymetric ridges on the basin floor. During episodes of eustatic low-stand, deep marine basin floor fans were preferentially deposited along the synclinal axes in a north-south orientation. In the earlier stages of the Mid Miocene these turbidites were confined within the mini-basins forming ponded, stacked fans and great thicknesses of reservoir sands are likely preserved.\nFrom the Lower Pliocene to the Pleistocene, the relative sea-level continued to rise. However, terrigenous influx exceeded the accommodation space resulting in shelf edge progradation. As a result of eustatic sea-level change, canyon systems dominated the shelf edge, and deep incisions can be seen from the 3D seismic as sediment was flushed into the deeper part of the basin to the southeast during lowstands. Shallow marine channels would have run across the shelf during periods of highstand and, in the event of episodic shelf flooding, it is possible that coals and organic beds were preserved. A sea-level drop in the Pleistocene to Holocene led to the denudation of the shoreline, and further progradation of the shelf edge. Clastic influx into the basin continued, and all sedimentary facies belts stepped further into the basin.\nFurther extensional deformation within the Sohar Basin occurred during the Miocene to Holocene (Fig. 11\n). This process is likely gravity-driven and occurred in response to differential loading between the shelf, shelf edge, and the depo-centres of the deltaic system. In the north towards the Oman border and into the Musandam, the subsurface is almost devoid of extensional faulting and comprises only compressional deformation. In the south towards the Oman border, regional-scale extensional features cross-cut all stratigraphic units leaving an overall extensional overprint on the pre-existing compressional architecture. This continues to the south into Oman as demonstrated by Levell et al. (2021) as well as Lawati et al. (2004), (Fig. 16), and discussed by Calvache and Holland (2001), where this same delta system develops into a 60\u00a0km long, seismically imaged gravity-driven slide in Omani waters (Levell et al., 2021).\n\n\n8\nProspectivity and play types\nFollowing an assessment of the wells drilled within the Sohar Basin and integration of the sequence stratigraphic interpretation, a series of prospective plays have been recognised and are summarised in Fig. 12\n. The prospective play types range in age from Eocene to Holocene, many of which contain structural and stratigraphic elements. Potentially the most prospective play within the basin is the Lower Miocene Basin Floor Fan Play. These fans were deposited as sediment was flushed down the synclinal axes of the basin which formed during the Eocene-Oligocene compressional event. The reservoirs directly overlie source rocks deposited within restricted mini-basins, and are sealed by fine-grained pelagic material deposited as a result of high energy turbidity flows. Basin modelling indicates that as the delta system developed these source rocks were buried to sufficient depths enabling hydrocarbons' maturation.\n\n\n9\nSource rock and petroleum systems modelling\nOne of the key risks to consider in the Northern Sohar Basin is the source rocks' presence, maturity, and effectiveness. As discussed earlier, the stratigraphic interpretation indicates a likelihood of a source rock within the deep, narrow mini-basins between the toe-thrust anticlines. To understand the petroleum system, a basin modelling study was undertaken using Zetaware's' Trinity and Genesis software integrating the 2D and 3D seismic, biostratigraphic data, as well as the temperature and vitrinite reflectance data from two wells within the study area for thermal calibration.\nFurthermore, a consistent set of 1D models was built across the area of interest followed by a 3D basin modelling exercise. The results showed a substantial likelihood of an active petroleum system within the northern Sohar Basin, given that the source rock model is accurate, despite the Sohar Basin's position on cold oceanic crust.\n\n\n10\nSource presence and concept\nThere are positive indications for a working petroleum system in the Sohar Basin. This is supported by the fact that hydrocarbon (oil and gas) shows were reported within 6 out of the 9 wells drilled. However, in all of the drilled wells, especially in the Northern Sohar Basin, no rock of good petroleum source quality has been penetrated. A renewed understanding of the Sohar basin using a sequence stratigraphic approach and an assessment of global analogues suggests that organically enriched facies may lie within the \u201cpiggyback mini-basins.\u201d This has been noted nearby in the Makran Accretionary Wedge (MAW) where the present day structural setting is akin to the Syn-Tectonic unit in this study (the proposed source rock model). The organic-rich shales that piston cored have recovered from these analogue mini-basins are testament to this as a viable conceptual model (Bourget et al., 2010, Lahijani et al., 2019; & Schulte et al., 2000).\nIt is also likely that source rock facies of varying quality is present within the pre-tectonic unit. This unit is equivalent to the Eocene-Paleocene of the Pabdeh Group where it is known to have sufficient source quality in Iran and the Foreland basin to the west of the Oman Mountains (Bordenave and Burwood, 1990, Alizadeh et al., 2020). Additionally, within the Fujairah 2 well that penetrated this section in the Northern Sohar Basin, some layers of source quality were found after geochemical analysis. The thickness of the unit (>1\u00a0km) could compensate for the lack of world-class source quality in the basin and so this unit should be considered as a potential source rock.\n\n\n11\nBurial history and maturity modelling\nBurial history plots were created across the basin to visualise the maturation of source rocks through time. Fig. 13\n displays an example burial history curve for a pseudo well generated in the deepest part of the eastern mini-basin where a source rock is predicted to exist. Pre-Tectonic source rocks would begin to mature in the Miocene when the mini-basins formed. Furthermore, potential source rocks in the lower part of the Syn-Tectonic package would commence the generation of hydrocarbons in the latter part of the Miocene or Pliocene. This occurred as accommodation space was created due to subsidence and sediments were flushed into the basin, burying the source rocks to sufficient depth. Within this deep mini-basin in the east the highest maturities are expected to be attained.\nAs shown in present-day maturity maps, the main or peak oil expulsion window is being reached in the lower part of the syn-tectonic unit (Fig. 14\n) and the condensate or wet gas window is being reached at mid pre-tectonic stratigraphic levels (Fig. 15\n). In the syn-tectonic case (Fig. 14) the oil maturities are attained within the two major mini-basins with smaller isolated zones reaching early oil maturity. Whereas in the pre-tectonic case (Fig. 15), every mapped mini-basin is mature for peak oil generation up to wet gas\/condensate generation. This demonstrates that source rocks can attain sufficient maturities to generate and expel hydrocarbons despite being situated on cold oceanic crust.\n\n\n12\nDiscussion\n\nStyles et al. (2006) suggested that extension in the Sohar basin began as early as the Late Campanian during the late stages of the Aruma Basin's development. It is also understood that the toe-thrusts in this part of the Sohar Basin are directly related to this extensional event. Regional-scale seismic interpretation has identified syn-tectonic mini-basins which display seismic onlaps onto structural highs that thin at the edges and thicken into the centre. Biostratigraphic data from the drilled wells within the Northern Sohar Basin suggest that these syn-tectonic packages are of Mid-Eocene to Lower Miocene age. This consequently indicates that if the thrusting and extension along the basin's margin are intrinsically related, this extensional event is of Mid-Eocene to Lower Miocene age.\n\nLawati et al. (2004) as well as Calvache and Holland (2001) suggested that the toe-thrust system is related to the growth faulting along the continental margin in response to sediment loading in the Upper Tertiary (Fig. 16\n). This study suggests that the toe-thrust system is of Eocene-Lower Miocene age and that the extensional system is a more recent feature, which has led to the overall overprint of extensional deformation in the south of the study area. This study has incorporated seismic data (2D & 3D) that extends to the north towards the Musandam, away from the Neogene deltaic depo-centre where the toe-thrust system is still prominent. This indicates that the two tectonic events are decoupled, therefore, a two-stage tectonic history consisting of compression and later extension may now perhaps be more plausible.\nRegarding tectonic history and structural timing, Levell et al. (2021) suggested that one of the major anticlines in the basin (the Damanyat Anticline in the offshore Oman Sea) resulted from Eocene extension followed by a Miocene inversion. The results from this study, however, would suggest that the thrusting occurred first during the Eocene to Oligocene and extension occurred after this in two separate gravity-driven structural episodes. An integrated study running from the Northern Sohar Basin in the UAE's waters down into the Oman sector of the basin in the south would be required to fully understand the drivers behind the structural deformation and ultimate tectonostratigraphic history.\n\n\n13\nConclusion\nThe interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic in both a kinematic and a sequence stratigraphic framework has greatly enhanced the understanding of the Sohar Basin concerning facies distribution and basin fill. This has led to a new tectonostratigraphic model being proposed for the Northern Sohar Basin comprised of Pre-, Syn- and Post-Tectonic units.\nThe Sohar Basin remains prospective for hydrocarbon exploration, where the most attractive stratigraphic traps lie within the undrilled Basin-Floor-Fan Play. The integration of structural geology and sequence stratigraphic principles has been paramount to understanding the geological history of the basin and has unveiled previously un-mapped potential.\n\n","14":"","15":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nSalt minibasins are small basins, or depressions, surrounded by upwelling salt whose movement is dependent on the loading of synkinematic strata onto relatively thick evaporite successions (Jackson and Talbot, 1986; Jackson and Hudec, 2017). This forms a feedback loop between continuous sedimentation in salt minibasins and halokinesis. Primary and secondary minibasins are two fundamental types of basin identified in such settings, resting either on autochthonous or allochthonous salt, or on an equivalent salt weld. Consequently, secondary minibasins do not contain the oldest suprasalt stratigraphy that marks the early stages of halokinesis (Pilcher et al., 2011; Jackson and Hudec, 2017). Distinct fault families may occur around salt minibasins, with their geometry, orientation and distribution being closely related to the growth of the minibasin per se (Lopez, 1990; Rowan et al., 1999). For example, crestal faults are commonly developed above salt structures that surround minibasins, and they usually form planar growth faults rooting into the crests of diapirs, generating symmetric grabens above the latter (Rowan et al., 1999; Van Den Berg et al., 2004). In parallel, corridor faults pertain to faults generated above buried salt pillows, observed to connect discrete, but distant, salt structures. Corridor faults are often planar and comprise structural corridors that are preferential pathways for fluid (Mattos and Alves, 2018). Listric faults are another geometry of faults commonly observed in salt minibasins (Lopez, 1990; Diegel et al., 1995; Rowan et al., 1999). Their dip becomes gentler with depth, a geometry resulting in their characteristic concave-upwards shape (e.g. Bally et al., 1981; Shelton, 1984; Imber et al., 2003). The generation of listric faults in salt minibasins is commonly associated with viscous or ductile layers at depth (Shelton, 1984; Dula Jr, 1991; Imber et al., 2003; Brun and Mauduit, 2008; Bose and Mitra, 2009) or, instead, overpressure build-up due to abnormal pore pressure gradients in faulted stratigraphic intervals (Mcneill et al., 1997; Mandl, 1999; Hillis, 2003; Suppe, 2014; Yuan et al., 2020). Sediment compaction also plays an important role in forming listric faults, as the faults must flatten after they are buried by continued sedimentation, due to sediment compaction (Davison, 1987; Cartwright and Lonergan, 1996; Cartwright and Mansfield, 1998; Xiao and Suppe, 1989). The development of these fault families, especially listric faults, in salt minibasins is significant for hydrocarbon exploration, fluid-flow characterisation and carbon and energy storage, as they can act as effective fluid pathways or, instead, can form favourable traps for fluid (Rowan et al., 1999; Cox et al., 2001; Gartrell et al., 2004).\nAs a typical salt-bearing basin in SE Brazil, the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin comprises multiple fault families developed in the vicinity of growing salt structures (Fiduk et al., 2004; Mattos and Alves, 2018). In this same basin, Demercian et al. (1993) and Fiduk et al. (2004) have related the largest listric faults to extension accomodated on the proximal parts of the margin due to gravitational spreading and gliding of overburden rocks over Aptian salt. Ze and Alves (2016) have shown that relatively small listric faults accommodate strain and stress on the crests of the salt structures. Ze and Alves (2021) have revealed the existence of fluid flow through strata-bound domino faults in vicinity of the study area, whereas Mattos and Alves (2018) have studied the fault families around salt diapirs, showing that fault corridors linking adjacent salt structures are favourable fluid migration pathways. Nevertheless, little is known about the distribution and evolution history of different fault families in large areas of SE Brazil, and the South Atlantic as a whole.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution, evolution history and significance of distinct fault families in a salt minibasin formed in deep-water sectors of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Fig. 3\n\n\n). This work will also implement stress analyses to the interpreted fault families in the study area and indicate the potential fluid flow pathways in salt minibasins. In summary, this paper addresses the following research questions:\n\na)\nWhat is the importance of listric faults and their soling out intervals as structures signing the presence of rheologically weak, muddy successions in salt minibasins?\n\n\nb)\nWhat is the chronology of faulting around salt structures when comparing them to other fault families in the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin?\n\n\nc)\nWhich of the interpreted fault families is more favourable to form fluid-flow pathways in salt minibasins?\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin is located on the southeast continental margin of Brazil and covers an area of \u223c125,000\u00a0km2, of which 107,000\u00a0km2 are located offshore (Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). The basin is bounded to the north by the Abrolhos Plateau, a volcanic ridge separating the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin from the Mucuri and Cumuruxatiba basins. To the south, it is separated from the Campos Basin by a largely political boundary, as there is a continuum of rift, sub-salt and supra-salt units from the Campos to the Esp\u00edrito Santo basins (Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2010; Mattos and Alves, 2018). The Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin includes a series of rift basins trending N\u2013S to NNE-SSW that were formed due to Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous continental rifting and subsequent breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Fiduk et al., 2004; Mohriak et al., 2008; Alves, 2012; Piedade and Alves, 2017). The tectonic evolution of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin is similar to most rift basins in the South Atlantic Ocean, and can be divided into four separate stages: rift onset, syn-rift, transitional, and drift (Chang et al., 1992; Bruhn and Walker, 1997; Cobbold et al., 2001; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa et al., 2012) (Fig. 2).\n\n2.1\nRift-related evolution of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin\nThe rift onset stage of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin occurred in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and was characterised by the initiation of lithospheric extension at a regional scale (Ojeda, 1982; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Fiduk et al., 2004; Mohriak et al., 2008). Moderate tectonism and intense volcanism occurred throughout SE Brazil during this stage, with the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin becoming rapidly filled with coarse-grained fluvial sediment, alluvial fan deposits and localised evaporites (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Mohriak and Rosendahl, 2003).\nThe syn-rift stage lasted from late Berriasian\/Valanginian to the early Aptian (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa, 2011; Qin et al., 2016). It was marked by intense tectonism due to the enhanced lithospheric extension and asthenospheric uplift that accompanied the formation of the Eastern Brazilian Rift (Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999; Mohriak and Rosendahl, 2003). Syn-rift units comprise lacustrine sediments in elongated and faulted sub-basins formed between the Santos and the Sergipe\/Alagoas Basins. Three main facies associations were deposited at this stage: 1) alluvial fan\/fan deltas and transitional deposits, 2) lacustrine marls and shales, and 3) lacustrine pelecypod limestones, usually termed coquinas (Ojeda, 1982; Demercian et al., 1993; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999).\n\n\n2.2\nHalokinesis and Cenozoic evolution\nThe transitional stage occurred from early Aptian to late Aptian\/early Albian, a period of time associated with continental breakup occurring to the east (i.e. outboard) of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves et al., 2020). At this stage, the activity of large faults became concentrated at the locus of continental breakup to the east. Lithospheric extension significantly enhanced regional subsidence as recorded by the deposition of shallow water microbial carbonates, followed by the precipitation and accumulation of >3000\u00a0m of evaporites on the SE Brazil-West Africa conjugate margin (Davison et al., 2012). Such a transitional unit reflects a continental-breakup sequence with a typical regressive-transgressive cycle (Alves and Cunha, 2018; Alves et al., 2020).\nThe drift stage spanned from the Albian to present-day and marks the main phase of ocean spreading between South America and Africa (Ojeda, 1982; Fiduk et al., 2004; Gamboa, 2011). At this stage, tectonic activity was chiefly associated with thermal subsidence and marine deposition predominated in the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999). The drift stage comprises two distinct megasequences: an early drift transgressive megasequence and a late drift regressive megasequence (Chang et al., 1992; Cainelli and Mohriak, 1999). The early drift transgressive megasequence records the deposition of carbonate intervals below muddy and sandy turbidites, representing shallow water environments that deepened upwards until the end of the Cretaceous (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2016). The late drift regressive megasequence was marked by open marine deposition, reflecting the progressive filling of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin's continental shelf and slope (Ojeda, 1982; Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak et al., 2008).\nDue to regional extension and continuous subsidence, halokinesis occurred in the study area in response to differential loading by overburden strata, gravity spreading and downslope gravity gliding on top of evaporite successions (Demercian et al., 1993; Fiduk et al., 2004). Halokinesis lasted from the Albian to Holocene but peaked during the Late Cenozoic (Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves, 2012). It divided the basin into three tectonic domains with different structural styles: proximal extensional, transitional and distal compressional (Rouby et al., 2003; Vendeville, 2005; Gamboa et al., 2010; Mohriak et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2016). The proximal extensional domain includes salt rollers, salt walls along conjugate normal faults, turtle anticlines and rafts (Mohriak et al., 2008). The transitional domain is characterised by salt diapirs, while the distal compressional domain is dominated by allochthonous salt (Demercian et al., 1993; Davison, 2007).\n\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nThis paper uses a high-quality 3D seismic volume acquired in deep-water Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin in 2004, covering 360\u00a0km2 (Fig. 1). It was shot at a water depth ranging from 1630 to 2050 m. The seismic volume was acquired with a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05700\u00a0km array of streamers, and it was pre-stacked time migrated with a 12.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012.5\u00a0m grid line spacing. Seismic data processing included resampling, spherical divergence corrections and zero-phase conversions, all undertaken prior to data stacking (Fiduk et al., 2004; Alves, 2012; Ze and Alves, 2016; Piedade and Alves, 2017). Data are displayed using the European SEG standard for polarity in which a change in acoustic impedance from low to high is shown as a red seismic reflection, and from high to low is shown in black. The seismic volume was processed in the time domain following a sampling rate of 2\u00a0ms, re-sampled at 4\u00a0ms, with a dominant frequency of 40\u00a0Hz. This resulted in a minimum vertical resolution (1\/4 of the wavelet frequency, or \u03bb\/4) ranging from 11 to 19\u00a0m at the depth of strata investigated in this work (Mattos and Alves, 2018). In addition, two wells located in vicinity of the study area provide gamma-ray, lithology and Vp (p-wave velocity) data (Biancardi et al., 2020). Well correlations were also completed to identify lithological variations in the seismic-stratigraphic units interpreted in this study, and a chronostratigraphic framework was established based on Ze and Alves (2021) (Fig. 4\n).\nThe study area comprises a 20-km long, 6-km wide, NE-striking salt minibasin bounded to the west by two salt diapirs (A and B), and by a salt wall to the east (Figs. 1 and 3). Eight (8) key seismic-stratigraphic reflections, including the seafloor, were interpreted every ten lines (125\u00a0m) in our seismic volume (Figs. 5\u20138\n\n\n\n). Three principal stratigraphic units were defined based on their internal seismic reflection characters, bounding reflection terminations, and their relationship with main structural features. Variance time-slices were used to identify relevant fault families around salt structures (Fig. 3), as they clearly show important discontinuities on time slices, including faults and fractures (Brown, 2011).\nFive hundred and thirty-four (534) faults were manually interpreted every two crosslines\/inline (25\u00a0m). They were classified into four different fault families based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures. This procedure guaranteed high-enough accuracy when recording displacement data for distinct fault segments, as it complies with the minimum sampling interval defined in Ze and Alves (2019). The latter authors proposed that minimum throw\/displacement sampling intervals are related to the length of a fault; sampling intervals should be less than 5% of the fault length when the latter is\u00a0<\u00a03500\u00a0m, or 3% of the fault length when this is\u00a0>\u00a03500\u00a0m. In addition, the rose diagrams and histograms of strike and dip of each fault family were plotted by using fault-point data on Move, and the radius value of the rose diagram is plotted as a ratio (Fig. 10\n\n). The fault-point data were received by discretising faults that were interpreted on Schlumberger's Petrel\u00ae into facets, and time-depth conversions were implemented for these data on Move\u00ae.\nLater in our workflow, eight representative faults from the four interpreted fault families were selected to compile displacement-length along fault (Dmax-L) and displacement-depth (D-Z) plots, which were used to evaluate fault growth history in the investigated minibasin (Figs. 11\u201314\n\n\n\n). Fault displacement was calculated using trigonometry rules to discern the throw and heave for a fault, considering the fault as a pure dip-slip fault. Listric faults record a large amount of horizontal offset (heave) and using throw would be a limiting over-simplification in our analysis.\nThe relationship between maximum displacement (Dmax) and length (L) of a fault trace provides insights into the mechanisms of fault initiation, growth and evolution through time (Watterson, 1986; Walsh and Watterson, 1988; Peacock and Sanderson, 1991; Cowie and Scholz, 1992; Kim and Sanderson, 2005). The relationship between fault displacement (D) and depth (Z) provides insights into fault reactivation or nucleation positions (Mansfield and Cartwright, 1996; Cartwright and Mansfield, 1998; Baudon and Cartwright, 2008a; Baudon and cartwright, 2008b).\nStress inversions were completed using the Stress Analysis Module on Move\u00ae, which is based on the direct inversion method of Angelier (1990) by using dip-slip data of the interpreted faults including dip and dip azimuth. We estimated the orientation and distribution of palaeostress tensors responsible for the formation of each fault family observed in the study area, with the exception of listric faults. Listric and keystone faults were formed under the same stress field in the minibasin, suggesting that the palaeostress tensors obtained from keystone faults can be applied to listric faults.\nSlip tendency and leakage factors were also computed in Move's\u00ae Stress Analysis Module using the palaeostress azimuths obtained from stress inversions. For this stage in our analysis, faults and horizons interpreted in Petrel\u00ae were imported into Petroleum Experts Move\u00ae as 3D mesh surfaces, and later filtered for edge triangles. Key fault attributes, including true dip, strike and azimuth for each fault vertex, were created in Move\u00ae using the Attribute Analyser Toolbar. In addition, normalised leakage factors values were also calculated for each fault family, estimating favourable fluid pathways amongst the four fault families. As the palaeostress tensors obtained from stress inversion are not those representing the present-day stress regime, slip tendency and leakage factor analyses in this work comprise certain limitations, and do not fully indicate the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area at present. However, they represent the stresses that generated the faults interpreted in this work, and highlight any changes in the azimuth of such stresses in time and space, in the study area.\nSlip tendency (Ts) indicates the likelihood of a fault to slip, and is defined as the ratio of resolved shear (\u03c4) to normal stress (\u03c3n) (Equation (1); Morris et al., 1996; Lisle and Srivastava, 2004). It has no units and ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of a fault to slip. It is dependent on the differential stress ratio and on the orientation of the fault surface in relation to the orientation of a given stress field. Therefore, the slip tendency can be expressed as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nT\ns\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\/\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeakage factor (L) is a measure of the fluid transmissivity of faults, and is defined as the ratio of pore pressure (Pp) to the difference between normal (\u03c3n) and shear stresses (\u03c4) on a particular fault surface (Equation (2); Mattos and Alves, 2018; Ze and Alves, 2021). Pore pressure used in this study is the normal hydrostatic pressure calculated based on the depth we consider the fault have first nucleated. Leakage factor determines the likelihood of fault-seal failure; the higher the value, the greater the likelihood of a fault to act as a pathway for fluid. Therefore, the leakage factor can be written as:\n\n(2)\n\n\nL\n=\n\n\nP\nP\n\n\/\n\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\nn\n\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSeismic stratigraphy\n\n4.1\nUnit 1 (horizons H0 to H3)\nUnit 1 is the primary seismic interval of interest, comprising a package of low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections somewhat similar to its underlying suprasalt strata (Figs. 5\u20138). The base of Unit 1 is marked by horizon H0, a low-to moderate-amplitude negative reflection tied to the base of Paleocene strata, whereas its top is bounded by a high-amplitude negative reflection defined as horizon H3 (Figs. 5\u20138). Between horizons H0 and H3, we mapped two other horizons (H1 and H2) with moderate-amplitude positive reflections (Figs. 5\u20138). These two horizons (H1 and H2) divide Unit 1 into three different sub-units, respectively named Unit 1a, 1b and 1c (Figs. 5\u20138). The amplitude of internal reflections in Unit 1a is slightly higher than in Unit 1b and 1c (Figs. 5\u20138). Faulting is common inside Unit 1, but most faults do not propagate below its lower boundary (horizon H0). This is likely due to the relatively higher ductility of strata in Unit 1 when compared to the intervals above and below, a character resulting in faults terminating at this level. Unit 1 is up to 600\u00a0ms thick in the salt minibasin of interest, but this value decreases slightly towards the flanks of adjacent salt structures (Fig. 9).\nUnit 1 is composed of shale in its upper part (Unit 1b and 1c) and marl in its lower part (Unit 1a), with varying thickness and relative proportions of shale vs. marl at various locations (Fig. 4). Thin mudstone layers occur as intercalations in the essentially marly Unit 1a. Due to lithological changes, gamma-ray values reveal significant variations at depth. Unit 1b and 1c record high gamma-ray values, especially Unit 1c, but they gradually decrease towards the base of Unit 1b. Importantly, there is an increase in gamma-ray values from Unit 1a to 1b, and this increase correlates with the boundary between shale to marl in well data (e.g., well 1-BRSA-1143D; Fig. 4). Unit 1a presents higher gamma-ray values than Units 1b and 1c above, indicating Unit 1a contains a higher volume of shale than these former. In addition, gamma-ray values continue to increase below horizon H0 towards the top of the Aptian salt, although values in Unit 1 are similar to the underlying suprasalt strata (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.2\nUnit 2 (horizons H3 to H4)\nUnit 2 is bounded at its base by horizon H3, and at the top by horizon H4, a moderate-to high-amplitude positive reflection (Figs. 5\u20138). At the middle of Unit 2 there is one high-amplitude negative reflection that correlates with the base of Eocene strata (Figs. 5\u20138). This unit comprises a 200\u2013500\u00a0ms thick package, which is the thickest (\u223c500\u00a0ms) in the studied salt minibasin (Fig. 9). Unit 2 is the thinnest (\u223c200\u00a0ms) above the salt diapirs (Fig. 9). The unit shows low-amplitude to transparent seismic reflections in its lower part, but its upper part is marked by moderate-to high-amplitude seismic reflections. Faulting is common, with most faults propagating upwards and downwards into Unit 2.\nThe lithology of Unit 2 is very similar to the interval between horizon H1 and H3 (Unit 1b and 1c), as both are composed of shale. However, Unit 2 does not show marked changes in lithology and gamma-ray curves remain high and relatively constant (Fig. 4).\n\n\n4.3\nUnit 3 (horizon H4 to the seafloor)\nUnit 3 is bounded at its base by horizon H4, whereas its top coincides with the seafloor. Its thickness ranges from 400 to 800\u00a0ms, and shows low-amplitude to transparent internal reflections incised by submarine channels in some areas (Figs. 5\u20138). Two other horizons H5 and H6 were interpreted in this unit. Horizon H5 is a high-amplitude positive seismic reflection tied to the base of the Miocene, which is located two reflections above horizon H4 (Figs. 5\u20138). Horizon H6 is a high-amplitude positive reflection under another prominent high-amplitude negative reflection (Figs. 5\u20138). Most faults in the study area offset horizons H4 to H6, and many are truncated on their upper tips by mass-transport deposits (MTDs), which mark the remobilization of seafloor strata due to the influence of gravity forces.\nUnit 3 is mainly composed of clay and shows high, relative constant gamma-ray values in its lower part, especially between horizons H4 and H6 (Fig. 4). Its top part comprises a large volume of turbidites, which present relative low gamma-ray values.\n\n\n\n5\nFault families around salt structures\nFaults developed in the study area comprise four (4) fault families based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures: a) crestal faults, b) corridor faults, c) listric faults, and d) keystone faults (Figs. 3 and 10). Crestal faults include radial and concentric faults developed above salt structures due to halokinesis. Corridor faults pertain to faults connecting different salt structures, forming structural corridors that are preferential pathways for fluid (Mattos and Alves, 2018). Keystone and listric faults were developed in salt minibasins, but their geometries and periods of activity showed significant differences. In this section, we select eight (8) representative faults from the four fault families to compile displacement-length (Dmax-L) and displacement-depth (D-Z) plots (Figs. 11\u201314). These data are used to evaluate the growth history of faults.\n\n5.1\nCrestal faults\nA total of 239 crestal faults were manually mapped over salt diapir A, which is located in the northern part of the study area (Fig. 3). Crestal faults are well developed above this diapir, offsetting horizons H4 to H6 upwards to a depth just below a near-seafloor MTD (Figs. 3 and 5). Downwards, they terminate in Unit 1 to form graben structures above diapir A (Fig. 5). Crestal faults strike towards the NNE and have dips over 42\u00b0 (Figs. 9 and 10).\nCrestal faults 1 (CF1) and 2 (CF2) are respectively 1.5\u00a0km and 1.8\u00a0km long, N-striking, but show opposite dips; CF1 dips to the east, while CF2 dips to the west (Fig. 5). Their maximum displacement reaches 135\u00a0m and 153\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 11). Crestal fault CF1 grew by the lateral linkage of distinct segments, as shown by the rugged profile of its Dmax-L plot. A prominent linkage point is located around the position of profile e (Fig. 11). It is also clear from our D-Z data that the maximum displacement of CF1 occurs around horizon H3, with a decrease in displacement occurring between horizons H3 and H4 (Fig. 11). This suggests fault reactivation during the deposition of Unit 2.\nCrestal fault CF2 is an isolated fault revealing a rugged \u2018C\u2019 type in Dmax-L data (Fig. 11b). However, similarly to CF1, it shows multiple displacement minima values, implying that it was formed by dip linkage. The maximum displacement of CF2 occurs below horizon H3, showing that it first nucleated at this depth (Fig. 11). Interestingly, there are marked drops in displacement around horizon H3, especially around the position of profile g (Fig. 11g), suggesting that fault reactivation occurred at this level.\n\n\n5.2\nCorridor faults\nForty-five (45) corridor faults were recognised in the region between salt diapirs A and B, in the northwest part of the study area (Fig. 3). Corridor faults are NE-striking, with dips over 39\u00b0, and offset strata between horizons H1 to H6 (Figs. 6 and 10). Some large corridor faults also offset strata at horizon H0 and below (Fig. 6). They strike in a similar direction to the radial faults formed between diapirs A and B (Figs. 3 and 9).\nCorridor faults 1 (CoF1) and 2 (CoF2) were chosen as representative corridor faults in the study area (Fig. 3). They are 2.5\u00a0km and 2.2\u00a0km long and dip to the northwest, with displacement maxima of 97\u00a0m and 99\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 12). CoF1 offsets strata between H1 and terminates below the near-seafloor MTDs, while CoF2 offsets strata between H0 and H6. Both faults are single, isolated faults, as they have typical \u2018C-type\u2019 profiles in Dmax-L plots (Fig. 12). Their displacement maxima occur around horizon H3, indicating they nucleate around horizon H3. In addition, both faults record a decrease in displacement between horizons H3 and H4 (Fig. 12). This suggests that fault reactivation occurred at the level of Unit 2.\n\n\n5.3\nListric faults\nTen (10) listric faults were mapped as NW- to WNW-striking structures dipping to the northeast (Figs. 3 and 7\u20139). In plan-view, listric faults are curved, show variable lengths, and are cross-cut by adjacent faults (Figs. 3 and 9). On vertical seismic profiles, they are steep in their upper part but gradually sole out into Unit 1 (Figs. 7 and 8). Their dip ranges from 2\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 (Fig. 10), as they are gentler than the other fault families. Most listric faults are growth faults, i.e. they show thickening in strata adjacent to hanging-wall depocenters, a character that can be used to indicate their relative ages (Childs et al., 2003, 2017). Listric faults also reveal larger displacements when compared to the other fault families; they can be interpreted as structures accommodating extension along a NE-SW direction (Figs. 9 and 13).\nRepresentative listric faults 1 (LF1) and 2 (LF2) are 2.4\u00a0km and 3.2\u00a0km long, with displacement maxima of 1254\u00a0m and 717\u00a0m, respectively (Figs. 9 and 13). They offset strata between horizons H4 and H6, soling out in the uppermost part of Unit 1 (Figs. 7, 8 and 13). Both listric faults are offset by other faults, especially LF1, indicating they were formed earlier than the faults that offset them. Because of these offsetting faults, LF1 and LF2 show rugged shapes in their Dmax-L plots (Fig. 13). For instance, the marked displacement minima recorded between horizons H3 and H4 in D-Z profiles were also caused by younger faults offsetting them (Fig. 13). Displacement maxima in both LF1 and LF2 are recorded between horizons H3 and H4, implying the two faults nucleated at this depth (Fig. 13). Interestingly, the positions of displacement maxima are recorded close to the listric faults\u2019 lower tips (Figs. 7, 8 and 13), indicating they were not formed by the linkage between a steeply dipping fault and a gently dipping detachment. They nucleated around their lower tips, and propagated upwards (with minor downward propagation) to generate their present-day curvature.\n\n\n5.4\nKeystone faults\nTwo-hundred and forty (240) keystone faults were mapped in the salt minibasin of interest and they offset variable strata spanning horizons H0 to H6 (Figs. 7 and 8). Keystone faults are mainly NW-striking, relatively steep (>46.8\u00b0), with a few NE-striking faults occurring in the southern part of the minibasin (Figs. 3 and 8).\nKeystone faults 1 (KF1) and 2 (KF2) were chosen as representative faults in this work. They are 1.4\u00a0km and 3.1\u00a0km long, with displacement maxima of 114\u00a0m and 110\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 14). Both faults strike to the NW and dip to the southwest; they are also relatively steep and offset strata between horizons H1 to H6 (Figs. 7 and 8). KF1 records a displacement maximum around horizon H3 (Fig. 14), indicating that it first nucleated at this level. There is also significant displacement minima below horizon H4 (Fig. 14f), suggesting KF1 might have experienced some degree of reactivation at this level. KF2 is formed by lateral segment linkage as there is significant displacement minima along its striking direction, which correlate with the linkage points observed in variance time-slices (Fig. 3). The maximum displacement value for KF2 occurs near horizon H2 (Fig. 14), showing it nucleated at this level.\n\n\n\n6\n3D visualisation of listric faults and investigated relationship with specific shale units\nListric faults are well developed in the investigated salt minibasin and their lengths vary from 1.8\u00a0km to 4.9\u00a0km. They are also observed at different depths in the study area (Figs. 7\u20139 and 15\n). It is clear that listric faults developed in the south of the minibasin are deeper when compared to similar faults to the north (Figs. 7\u20139 and 15). In addition, growth strata reveal that listric faults in the south were formed earlier than those in the north. Two listric faults in the south of the minibasin were developed in Unit 1, with strata thickening in their hanging-wall depocenters (Fig. 15). In contrast, in the north of the minibasin, LF1 and LF2 sole out at the top interval of Unit 1 (Figs. 7 and 8), and growth strata indicate they were formed after the deposition of Unit 1.\nA key characteristic is that all listric faults analysed in this work sole out at the level of Unit 1, a package of low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections (Figs. 7, 8 and 15). Furthermore, borehole data show that Unit 1 is composed of shale and marl with high gamma-ray values (Fig. 4). Overpressure in Unit 1 is suggested by the existence of large pockmarks close to the upper tips of listric faults rooting at depth in this unit (Figs. 7 and 8). In fact, large-scale pockmarks have been previously considered to indicate the episodic loss of fluid due to overpressure build-up in underlying strata (M\u00fcller et al., 2018). Additionally, listric faults in the study area sole out into Unit 1, but they have not offset its lower boundary.\nWe interpret the formation of listric faults as related to local overpressure based on the mechanism proposed by Yuan et al. (2020). This may also explain the fact that listric faults in the south of minibasin formed earlier and deeper than those in the north, since Unit 1 is deepening to the south and local overpressures were putatively reached earlier in this part of the investigated salt minibasin when compared to its northern part.\n\n\n7\nFluid-flow potential in distinct fault families\nTo understand the orientation and distribution of the principal palaeostress tensors in the study area, stress inversions were completed for all interpreted fault families. Stress inversion results for the 534 faults interpreted in the study area show a stress tensor with a sub-vertical \u03c31 plunging 86.78\u00b0 along an N39.21\u00b0 azimuth. A sub-horizontal \u03c32 plunges \u22122.07\u00b0 along an N349.32\u00b0 azimuth, accompanied by \u03c33 plunging \u22122.46\u00b0 along an N79.41\u00b0 azimuth. However, as there are more than two preferential strike directions for faults in the study area due to halokinesis, we completed stress inversions separately for each fault family to obtain their own principal palaeostress tensors except listric faults (Table 1\n). Listric faults and keystone faults were formed under the same stress field in minibasin, and most listric faults were offset by keystone faults, suggesting that the palaeostress tensors obtained from keystone faults can be applied to listric faults. We thus used the stress inversions results described above to complement slip tendency and leakage factor analyses for each fault family (Figs. 16 and 17\n\n).\nSlip tendency models reveal marked differences among the four interpreted fault families (Fig. 16). Keystone faults record the largest average slip tendency (0.65), with values varying from 0.38 to 0.95 (Fig. 16e). In addition, NW-striking keystone faults record significantly higher slip tendency values than NE-striking keystone faults, meaning that the former (keystone) faults have the highest probability to slip. Corridor faults show the second largest average slip tendency (0.63), with ranges in slip tendency similar to keystone faults, from 0.38 to 0.9 (Fig. 16c). Crestal faults have lower average slip tendency than corridor faults (0.55), and values range from 0.3 to 0.83 (Fig. 16b). Listric faults become the lowest average slip tendency (0.15), with values ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 (Fig. 16d). These observations suggest that listric faults have the lowest tendency to slip.\nNormalised leakage factors were also calculated based on the stress tensor considered for each fault family, and they show similar trends to slip tendency (Fig. 17). The normalised leakage factor values for keystone faults mainly range from 0.45 to 0.95 with an average value of 0.72 (Fig. 17e), showing that these faults have the highest probability of conducting fluid among the four fault families. Corridor faults and crestal faults record similar average normalised leakage factor (0.71 and 0.66), with values ranging from 0.45 to 0.94 and 0.33 to 0.91, respectively (Fig. 17b and c). Listric faults show the lowest average normalised leakage factor (0.3), with values ranging from 0.11 to 0.56.\nAccording to the data described above, we find that keystone faults record the highest values for slip tendency and normalised leakage factors, and NW-striking keystone faults show larger values than other directions of keystone faults. Corridor and crestal faults have similar values for slip tendency and leakage factor. Conversely, listric faults show the lowest values in both slip tendency and leakage factors. Importantly, the dip and depth of faults significantly influences the calculated slip tendency and leakage factor values, as high-angle and shallow faults record higher values for both parameters than low angle and deep faults.\n\n\n8\nDiscussion\n\n8.1\nSignificance of listric faults and their soling out intervals\nOne of the key questions arising from our study concerns the significance of listric faults in salt minibasins. As previously mentioned in this work, listric faults sole out in Unit 1, which is composed of shale and marl with high gamma-ray values, as documented in borehole data (Fig. 4). In addition, multiple bright spots, one known indicator of hydrocarbons, are observed in the lower part of listric faults (Figs. 7, 8 and 15), showing that the lower part of listric faults acts as a barrier or seal to hydrocarbons and other fluids. Large pockmarks are also observed close to the upper tip of listric faults, indicating the existence of local strata overpressures.\nThe strata in which listric faults sole out overlies the thick salt rocks, indicating that potential overpressure occurs in suprasalt strata. These overpressures may be caused by dehydration at smectite-illite transition depths, or by the generation of hydrocarbons from source rocks, both occurring after reaching specific threshold temperatures (Bruce, 1984). The suprasalt strata below Unit 1 were deposited in the early drift-stage, correlating with upper Cretaceous intervals in the Lower Urucutuca Formation (Fig. 2). They comprise Cenomanian to Turonian transgressive marine deposits with type III kerogen, capable of producing high-API oils and gas (Mello and Maxwell, 1990; Fiduk et al., 2004). This kerogen should have reached thermal maturity - though buried at a relative shallow depth of around 1300\u20132000m - because a major thermal pulse in the early to middle Eocene has been recognised on multiple well data from the continental shelf. This thermal pulse is associated with the emplacement of the Abrolhos volcanic Plateau (Meisling et al., 2001; Cobbold et al., 2001; Gibbs et al., 2003; Fiduk et al., 2004). Due to the presence of bright spots in the lower part of listric faults, we suggest that overpressure in the study area was caused by the cracking of hydrocarbons in Cenomanian to Turonian strata, which was locally heated due to the high thermal conductivity of underlying salt.\nThe lower Urucutuca formation is composed of shale and marl, and shows the highest gamma-ray values in the study area (Fig. 4). At the same time, it comprises low amplitude to transparent seismic reflections in seismic data (Figs. 5\u20138 and 15). The interval into which listric faults sole out have similar seismic, lithological and petrophysical characters to Lower Urucutuca strata (Figs. 5\u20138 and 15). In parallel, the interval in question was deposited in an evolving salt minibasin, in which strata is potentially rich in organic carbon due to its restricted ocean circulation (Dow, 1984; Lopez, 1990). Thus, it is highly likely that listric fault sole out in ductile, potentially organic-rich shales and marls, though drilled wells crossing such horizon did not provide total organic carbon (TOC) data. The soling out intervals directly overlie Lower Urucutuca source-rock intervals deposited in the Cenomanian-Turonian (Cobbold et al., 2001; Gibbs et al., 2003; Fiduk et al., 2004), suggesting these intervals may be added to the known source-rock potential of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin.\n\n\n8.2\nFaults as markers of distinct stages of halokinesis\nTectonic faults are one of the most common brittle structures in sedimentary basins and provide important information about the evolution of a sedimentary basin. As part of a typical salt-bearing basin, the formation and evolution of faults in the study area have been strongly influenced by halokinesis. We have identified three evolutionary stages between horizon H0 and the seafloor in the study area, correlating to the drift stage of the Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (Fig. 18\n).\nStage 1 (Paleocene), between seismic horizons H0 and H3, is characterised by the formation of a few NW- or WNW-striking listric faults, keystone faults, and marks the onset of reactive diapirism in the study area. Several WNW-striking listric faults revealing significant strata thickening in their hanging walls were formed during this stage (Figs. 9 and 15), and accommodated displacement along a NE-SW direction. At this same time, NW- to WNW-striking keystone faults were also developed, implying the establishment of a NE-SW direction of extension. However, the activity of salt diapirs and walls was minor during Stage 1, as only few crestal faults and corridor faults were formed around these same structures. Corroborating this interpretation, the thickness of strata between horizons H0 and H3 is relatively constant in the study area (Fig. 10), and no significant erosion occurred on top of salt structures (Fig. 18a). The relatively weak halokinesis can be explained by the absence of significant sediment loading and, as a result, NE-SW extension predominated in the study area during Stage 1.\nStage 2 (Late Paleocene-Early Oligocene), marked by strata deposited between horizons H3 and H4, records active diapirism as a consequence of enhanced sediment loading over the salt, and lead to the development of crestal and NE-striking corridor faults (Fig. 18b). A few NE- and NW-striking keystone faults, plus NW-striking listric faults, were also developed during this stage. Halokinesis was intensified with increasing sediment loads, with salt diapirs and walls developing by active diapirism. NE-striking corridor faults started to form at this stage, synchronously with crestal faults. In contrast to Stage 1, strata are thicker in salt minibasins (up to 450\u00a0m) compared to the units accumulated on top of salt structures (less than 200\u00a0m), proving that significant erosion, or non-deposition, occurred above the latter. Importantly, the development of several NW-striking listric faults and multiple NW-striking keystone faults still denote a predominant NE-SW direction of extension in the investigated salt minibasin.\nWith continuing halokinesis, the salt underlying the minibasins was withdrawn to feed the surrounding salt diapirs and walls, promoting moderate extension along a NW-SE direction (Fig. 18b). This eventually formed NE-striking faults, which intersected the NW-striking keystone and listric faults. Such a cross-cutting relationship is obvious in the southern part of the main salt minibasin as large volumes of salt were withdrawn in this region. Conversely, in the northern half of the minibasin there is only one small salt diapir below horizon H3, leading to the generation of crestal faults with different strikes (Fig. 18b).\nStage 3 (Late Oligocene-Recent), spanning strata between horizon H4 and the seafloor, is characterised by more intense (active) diapirism due to increased sediment loading, a process resulting in the formation of multiple crestal faults around salt structures, NE-striking corridor faults, NW-striking keystone faults and NE-striking keystone faults. These faults present variable geometries, although the main salt minibasin was still controlled by a NE-SW direction of extension, as NW-striking keystone faults were developed during this stage. There was also NW-SE extension in the southern part of the salt minibasin, which led to the generation of the NE-striking faults that intersect NW-striking keystone faults (Fig. 18c). In addition, these same keystone faults were formed after the listric faults considered in this work, and they offset the latter in the study area. Later in the evolution of the salt minibasin, a large mass-transport deposit (MTD) was accumulated near the seafloor due to widespread gravity spreading and downslope sediment movement (Figss. 4\u20137). In fact, MTDs exhibit a high variability in size and internal character in the study area (Biancardi et al., 2020), and truncate the upper tip of several faults, especially crestal faults developed above salt diapirs (Fig. 5).\n\n\n8.3\nImplications for the establishment of favourable fluid pathways\nFaults can act as effective conduits for fluid in sedimentary basins but, conversely, they can also locally act as barriers to fluid along fault zones (Cox et al., 2001; Gartrell et al., 2004). In practice, it is commonly difficult to determine whether a fault acts as conduit or barrier to fluid flow, as its sealing competence is influenced by multiple factors such as the lithology of the strata crossed by the fault, its displacement, fault-gouge geometry, fault geometry in relation to local stress fields, post-deformation cementation, interactions between fluids and host rock, etc. (Caine et al., 1996; Fisher and Knipe, 2001; Koledoye et al., 2003; Manzocchi et al., 2010). In the study area, four (4) fault families are developed around salt structures, and it is of great importance to identify and model the favourable pathways for fluid migrating from deeper strata (e.g. Gartrell et al., 2004; Hovland, 2007; Davison, 2009; Andresen et al., 2011). Fault and fluid flow mapping can also be helpful to predict geohazards associated with fluid flow and seafloor leakage such as submarine slope instability, or the sudden formation of pockmarks and near-seafloor fluid pipes (Elger et al., 2018; Cartwright et al., 2021). In this study, a normalised leakage factor was estimated for each of the four fault families to provide information about which is the most favourable fluid pathways.\nNormalised leakage factors are the highest for keystone faults, ranging from 0.45 to 0.95 for an average value of 0.73 (Fig. 15e). Keystone faults are thus highly likely to act as conduits for fluid. In addition, keystone faults were active during all three evolution stages considered in this work, propagating into Unit 1 \u2013 regarded as a potential source interval. This means keystone faults are more likely to contribute to the migration of fluid from deeply-buried source rocks to shallow reservoirs. Corridor and crestal faults show leakage factor values varying from 0.45 to 0.94 and 0.37 to 0.91, respectively, with average values of 0.71 and 0.66 (Fig. 17). The leakage factor values for corridor and crestal faults are similar to those of keystone faults, suggesting they are also likely to act as pathways for fluid. Most of these faults were formed during Stages 2 and 3 under the effect of active diapirism and have propagated at different depths, including into Unit 1. They were also developed on top of salt diapirs where hydrocarbon tends to accumulate, so the reservoirs close to the upper part of crestal faults and corridor faults are possible exploration targets.\nListric faults have the lowest normalised leakage factor value ranging from 0.11 to 0.56, with an average of 0.4, indicating that they are more likely to act as barriers and baffles to fluid. This character explains the multiple bright spots encountered in the lower part of listric faults. However, listric faults are usually growth faults in the study area, and were mainly formed during Stages 1 and 2. They continued to be active for a long period, promoting the leakage of fluid in their upper parts, and generating large pockmarks above their upper tips. Therefore, based on our leakage factor data, we propose that keystone faults constitute the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area. Corridor and crestal faults also show potential to form pathways for fluid flow, but listric faults are likely barriers to fluid, particularly in their lower parts.\n\n\n\n9\nConclusions\nThis work aimed at understanding the distribution, evolution history and significance of different fault families in a salt minibasin, and any favourable fluid pathways offshore Esp\u00edrito Santo Basin (SE Brazil). The main conclusions of this work can be summarised as follows:\n\na)\nFour fault families are identified based on their geometry, orientation, distribution and relationship with main salt structures. Crestal faults were formed around salt structures together with radial and concentric faults. Corridor faults were developed among discrete salt diapirs, linking them through long corridors of oriented, conjugate fault families. Listric and keystone faults were formed in salt minibasins and were related to important extensional stresses.\n\n\nb)\nThe development of listric faults can indicate the existence of sub-surface overpressure in strata. Moreover, the intervals into which listric faults sole out comprise soft and ductile strata, which is high likely associated with source rocks. These intervals may be added to the known source-rock potential of a given basin, identifying their depth and relative thickness.\n\n\nc)\nThree fault evolution stages are identified in the study area. Stage 1 records the formation of a few NW- and WNW-striking listric and keystone faults in response to the onset of reactive diapirism. Stages 2 and 3 mark a shift to active diapirism in the study area promoted by increasing sediment loading, and lead to the formation of crestal, corridor and keystone faults.\n\n\nd)\nNormalised leakage factors show that keystone faults are the most favourable fluid pathways in the study area. Corridor and crestal faults also show potential as pathways for fluid. Conversely, listric faults are likely barriers and baffles to fluid, particularly in their lower parts.\n\n\n\n\n","16":"","17":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nFolds are important deformation features that occur in compressional belts worldwide (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Mitra, 1990; Verg\u00e9s, 1993). Such structures have largely been a target for oil and gas exploration (Mitra, 1990), and in depleted oil fields, they depict important analogues for the assessment of CO2 storage potential (Mitiku and Bauer, 2013). Geological storage of CO2 (GSC) requires an appropriate reservoir placed at a suitable depth to guarantee efficiency (Alcalde et al., 2014; Bachu, 2000; Sun et al., 2020). However, the presence of fold-related fractures, which have a critical impact on the distribution of the reservoir quality, is not always easy to characterize at depth because they are usually below the resolution of standard geophysical techniques (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Casini et al., 2011; Gutmanis et al., 2018). Therefore, the orientation, extent and the implication of such fracture systems for reservoir potential in the subsurface can only be predicted by using geological models and outcrop analogues (Brandes and Tanner, 2014; Sun et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015). Additionally, the formation of fold-related fractures strongly controls the origin, evolution and distribution of fluids that migrate during folding (Cosgrove, 2015; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Lefticariu et al., 2005). The appraisal of the fold-fracture relationships in natural field analogues is crucial: (i) to predict the orientation of fracture networks (fluid pathways) in areas where outcrops are absent (Bergbauer and Pollard, 2004); and, (ii) to identify the main factors controlling fluid-rock interactions in orogenic systems (Beaudoin et al., 2020; Callot et al., 2013; Ferket et al., 2006; Labeur et al., 2021; Roure et al., 2005; Swennen et al., 2000; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Vilasi et al., 2009). Beyond this, understanding the fluid flow and deformation relationships has become of renewed interest in applied fields mainly related to climate change mitigation (Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS) and in the transition to a net zero emissions energy (exploration of natural hydrogen or geothermal anomalies, among many others) (Benedicto et al., 2021; Cooper, 2007; Macgregor, 1996; Sun et al., 2020).\nDue to the economic importance of understanding the folding, fracturing and fluid flow relationships, several studies have reported the fluid system associated with the evolution of anticlines in the Pyrenees (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016; Martinez Casas et al., 2019; Nardini et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2022; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007) and in other worldwide compressional settings (Barbier et al., 2012; Beaudoin et al., 2011, 2020; Evans et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2009; Lefticariu et al., 2005). However, these studies have mainly focused on the fracture-controlled paleohydrological evolution through time or in fluid flow associated with specific domains of the fold (Cruset et al., 2016). Thereby, the spatial variation in the fluid flow behavior and the extent of fluid-rock interaction at the different structural position of a fold have been much less documented (Evans and Fischer, 2012).\nIn this contribution, we report the absolute timing of deformation together with the spatio-temporal variation of the fold-fluid system and the main factors controlling the fluid origin and distribution in different structural positions of a large-scale fold, using the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline in the Southern Pyrenees as an example. This anticline displays excellent exposures of pre- and syn-orogenic strata involving carbonate and clastic sedimentary units (Mencos, 2010; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Sim\u00f3, 1986). This fact, together with the presence of well data and seismic reflection profiling has allowed previous studies to characterize the fold geometry and the fold-related fracture systems (Mencos, 2010; Mencos et al., 2011; Mu\u00f1oz, 2017; Nardini et al., 2019; Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011; Verg\u00e9s, 1993). However, in this anticline, the fold-related fractures are controlled by the orientation of inherited extensional faults, resulting in asymmetric fracture networks that are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the fold axial trend (Tavani et al., 2011). Consequently, due to the asymmetrical orientation of the fractures and the absence of crosscutting relationships between most of these sets, the timing of deformation has not been entirely constrained. Hence, the main objectives of this contribution are: 1) to appraise the absolute timing of fracturing and the age and duration of fold evolution in an anticline that exhibits well-preserved growth strata that allows us to corroborate the coherence of the geochronological data; 2) to qualitatively evaluate the extent of fluid-rock interaction in fractures; 3) to decipher the origin, distribution and variation of fluids across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline; and 4) to compare our results with those reported in similar compressional settings. In order to address these objectives, we provide field structural data, together with petrographic, geochemical (\u03b418O, \u03b413C, 87Sr\/86Sr, \u039447 and elemental composition) and geochronological (U\u2013Pb ages) analyses of vein cements developed within pre- and syn-folding strata. This robust dataset has been completed with already published data from specific structures of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Labra\u00f1a de Miguel, 2004; Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019). Beyond the regional conclusions, our study provides a well-constrained absolute timing of deformation in an anticline that preserves pre-, syn- and post-folding fractures that do not exhibit a symmetrical orientation with respect to the fold axis, which have important implications for the interpretation of fold-fracture systems. Within this well-constrained structural setting, our study provides new constraints on the duration of fold evolution and further documents the variations and implications of the fluid flow behavior across the anticline during the entire folding event.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Pyrenees consist of an asymmetrical and doubly verging orogenic wedge that resulted from the Alpine collision between the Iberian and European plates from Late Cretaceous to Miocene, causing the inversion of previous Mesozoic rift basins and subsequent growth of the orogenic belt (Choukroune, 1989; Grool et al., 2018; Mouthereau et al., 2014; Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Tugend et al., 2014; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). The Pyrenean structure comprises an antiformal stack of basement-involved thrust sheets from the Axial Zone flanked by two oppositely verging fold-and-thrust belts and their related foreland basins (Fig. 1\na and b) (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; S\u00e9guret and Daigni\u00e8res, 1986). The southern fold-and-thrust belt includes a piggy-back imbrication of Mesozoic-Cenozoic cover thrust sheets that have been detached from the Paleozoic basement along Upper Triassic evaporites (Roure et al., 1989; S\u00e9guret and Daigni\u00e8res, 1986). In the South-Central Pyrenees, these cover thrust sheets are, from north and older to south and younger, the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, active from the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, the Montsec thrust sheet emplaced during the Paleocene to late Ypresian, and the Serres Marginals thrust sheet emplaced from Lutetian to Oligocene times (Roure et al., 1989; Verg\u00e9s and Mu\u00f1oz, 1990). The B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet results from the tectonic inversion of the Organy\u00e0 Basin and its tectonic transport to the south. Its front corresponds to an intricate thrust fault zone of more than 40\u00a0km in length that from east to west forms the Narg\u00f3, B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli thrust segments, interpreted as a fault-propagation by Bond and McClay (1995), while growth anticlines formed in its hangingwall: Roca Narieda, Narg\u00f3, B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990). This study focuses on the westernmost section of these growth folds that corresponds to the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Fig. 2\na and b).\nThe complete stratigraphic record involved in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline includes Upper Triassic to Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic rocks and Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic units (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Mencos et al., 2015; Sim\u00f3, 1986) (Fig. 2c). The pre-orogenic sequence includes up to 5\u00a0km of pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift (pre-orogenic) rocks located in the hanging wall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust. The pre-rift sequence, which is up to a few thousand meters thick (Lanaja, 1987; Mencos et al., 2011), crops out discontinuously in the study area and includes Upper Triassic shales and evaporites, which constitutes the main detachment level in the Pyrenees, and Jurassic dolomitic limestones and dolostones. The Lower Cretaceous syn-rift sequence extensively crops out in the hinge of the anticline. This sequence ranges from a few meters to more than 4000\u00a0m thick, and includes an intercalation of basinal marls, marly limestones and limestones (i.e., the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation), which lower part abruptly evolves to platform limestones (the Setcomelles Member) (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002).\nThe upper Cenomanian to lower Santonian post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence is around 800\u00a0m thick and mainly consists of carbonate rocks divided in five sedimentary formations, which in the study area are known as the Santa Fe, the Reguard, the Congost, the Collada Gass\u00f3 and the Sant Corneli Formations (Gallem\u00ed Paulet et al., 1982; Mencos, 2010; Sim\u00f3, 1986).\nThe syn-orogenic sequence is well-exposed in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and includes more than 1000\u00a0m of upper Santonian to Paleocene sedimentary rocks exhibiting growth geometries. These syn-orogenic rocks, which have been dated using biostratigraphy (G\u00f3mez-Garrido, 1987; Mencos, 2010; Mercedez, 2005; Sim\u00f3, 1986), comprise three shallowing upward sequences grading from turbidites and marls into shallow marine, fluvial and continental deposits (Mencos, 2010; Mey et al., 1968). These three sequences belong to the Vallcarga Formation and to the Areny and the Tremp Groups. The Vallcarga Formation (upper Santonian to middle Campanian) mainly consists of hemipelagic marls. The middle part of this formation consists of a slope-toe chaotic unit (i.e., the Puimanyons Member) developed due to the destabilization of the carbonate platform and characterized by growth faulting and olistostrome resulting from basin margin collapse during the growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli (Bond and McClay, 1995; Sim\u00f3, 1986). The Areny Group (late Campanian to Maastrichtian) deposited during the B\u00f3ixols thrust activity and related B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline growth (Bond and McClay, 1995; Mencos et al., 2011; Robert et al., 2018). This sequence mainly consists of shallow marine to coastal deposits. Finally, the Maastrichtian to Paleocene Tremp Group (i.e., Garumnian facies) includes alluvial, fluvial, lacustrine and carbonate deposits.\nThe structure of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet is composite, formed by the large Santa Fe syncline and the two linked and south-verging anticlines of B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli (the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline) (Fig. 2a and b). The surficial expression of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline crops out along more than 40\u00a0km showing a well-defined geometry in its central-western segment that is characterized by a gently dipping (around 40\u00b0) northern backlimb and a subvertical to overturned southern forelimb.\nDuring the inversion of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front, shortening direction has been determined as NNW-SSE (Tavani et al., 2011). This orientation, which is not perpendicular but slightly oblique to E-W trending inverted normal fault, strongly conditioned the orientation of fractures developed during the evolution of this frontal anticline (Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011).\nThe B\u00f3ixols thrust along the forelimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is well preserved, near the villages of B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca (Fig. 2). Contrarily, around the Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is blind and sealed by syn-orogenic deposits and the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols anticline is cut by decametric to kilometric subvertical strike-slip faults (e.g., Nardini et al., 2019) (Fig. 2). The northern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is cut by well-preserved large normal faults displacing Upper Cretaceous carbonate sequences in Montagut and Sant Joan localities. All these fractures record a significant part of the structural and fluid flow histories of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, which preserves both pre- and syn-orogenic deformation.\n\n\n3\nMethodology\nThis study integrates field, petrographic, geochemical, and geochronological analyses of vein cements and related host rocks from 10 representative localities (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). The field data comprise bedding and fracture dips and dip directions and their crosscutting relationships and kinematics. Such data are plotted in equal-area lower-hemisphere stereoplots to define different fracture systems. Restoration of these fracture systems with respect to the adjacent bedding and estimation of the associated stress orientations have been carried out using Win-Tensor software (Delvaux and Sperner, 2003). For analysis of fault kinematics, this software considers the improved Right Dihedron method (Angelier, 1984), which is an inversion technique that under basic assumptions and limitations (Lacombe, 2012), allowed us to calculate paleostress orientations and stress ratios for the different striated faults present in the study area.\nUp to 185 samples of the involved host rocks and all vein cement generations filling the recognized fractures systems have been selected for petrographic, geochemical and geochronological analyses. Around 135 polished thin sections of these samples have been analyzed for petrographic descriptions with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and a cold cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope operating at 15\u201318\u00a0kV and 350\u00a0\u03bcA current.\nGeochemical analyses have been applied to vein cements and host rocks in order to determine the origin, distribution and temperature of the vein-forming fluids as well as the extent of fluid-rock interaction. These geochemical data consist of (i) stable isotope analysis of 150 representative samples, (ii) the elemental composition of 69 samples, (iii) the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of 43 samples, (iii) clumped isotope thermometry of 21 samples, the results of which were converted to temperatures by applying the calibration method of (Kluge et al., 2015). Calculated \u03b418Ofluid values are expressed in per mill (\u2030) with respect to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). This study also includes U\u2013Pb dates obtained with a laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (LA-ICPMS) at FIERCE (Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center, Goethe University). Details on the different methods and procedures can be found in the supplementary material.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nStudied localities\nThe studied localities record the deformation history and fluid flow events that occurred in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, ten sampling localities were selected as representative of the different fracture networks as well as the involved host rocks already described in the geological setting. The main characteristics of these localities are described below.\nThe B\u00f3ixols locality (B) is located in the B\u00f3ixols village, next to the axial surface of the anticline. In this locality, the contact between the Lower Cretaceous limestones and marls from the syn-rift sequence and the Jurassic dolomitic limestones from the pre-rift succession has been interpreted as the preserved upper part of the main E-W Early Cretaceous extensional fault (e.g., Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Tavani et al., 2011).\nThe Cal Mestre locality (CM) is located 0.5\u00a0km to the northeast of the B\u00f3ixols village, in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols anticline. In this area, the Lower Cretaceous limestones and marls from the syn-rift sequence are broadly exposed exhibiting a minimum thickness of 2500\u00a0m according to well data (Lanaja, 1987).\nThe Montagut (MGT) and the Sant Joan (SJ) localities are in the northern limb of the anticline, affecting Upper Cretaceous limestones from the post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence. The structure of the Montagut locality consists of relatively well exposed systems of normal, oblique-slip and strike-slip faults with a lateral continuity of several kilometers (Fig. 3a\u2013c) (i.e., the Montagut fault system). The structure of the Sant Joan locality includes two conjugate sets of strike-slip faults and a different set of normal faults. The latest set is referred in this study as the Sant Joan fault system (Fig. 3c).\nThe remaining localities are located along the frontal region of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and include fractures that cut pre-orogenic depositional units from the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and syn-orogenic units deposited in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet. The B\u00f3ixols thrust has been studied in Abella de la Conca (ABC), Forat de B\u00f3ixols (FB) and Setcomelles (SET) localities (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In Abella de la Conca and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities, the E-W trending and north-dipping B\u00f3ixols thrust offsets subvertical post-rift Upper Cretaceous limestones along the southern limb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The Abella de la Conca locality also includes a reduced Upper Cretaceous syn-orogenic sequence. The Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality, located 2\u00a0km southwest of the B\u00f3ixols village, preserves a good exposure that allowed to study the evolution of fractures across the B\u00f3ixols thrust zone in a previous paper (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b) (Fig. 4b). In the Setcomelles locality, between B\u00f3ixols and Sallent villages, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is interpreted as a footwall shortcut of the previous Lower Cretaceous Organy\u00e0 fault. In this area, Jurassic dolomitized limestones juxtapose against Upper Cretaceous limestones (Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002) (Fig. 4c). The Sant Antoni (SA), Orcau (OC) and Coll de Narg\u00f3 (CN) localities are aligned along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, involving Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic sequences showing growth strata patterns (Bond and McClay, 1995; Garrido-Meg\u00edas et al., 1972; Mencos et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2017; Verg\u00e9s and Mu\u00f1oz, 1990). The Sant Antoni locality, next to the Sant Antoni dam, comprises the lowest part of the syn-orogenic sequence integrated in the Vallcarga Fm. (Fig. 4d). The Orcau locality, next to the Orcau village, constitutes the middle part of the syn-orogenic unit integrated in the Areny Group. Finally, the Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality, near the Coll the Narg\u00f3 village, involves the upper part of the syn-orogenic sequence integrated within the Garumnian facies from the Tremp Group. In this area, the B\u00f3ixols thrust is buried and the syn-orogenic deposits are deposited in angular unconformity on the front of the anticline and are affected by conjugated systems of veins and strike-slip faults (i.e., the Coll de Narg\u00f3 faults) (Nardini et al., 2019).\n\n\n4.2\nPetrographic description of host rocks\nIn this section, we summarize the main petrographic features of the studied host rocks. The syn-rift Lower Cretaceous Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation, made up of mudstones with isolated sponge spicules and agglutinated foraminifera (Fig. 5\na), features a dark brown to non-luminescence (Fig. 5b). The lower part of the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Fm (the Setcomelles Member) is formed of wackestones, locally packstones, made up of corals, red algae (Agardhiellopsis cretacea), echinoderms, bryozoans and foraminifera. The moldic porosity is filled with micrite sediment with a geopetal distribution, which indicates vadose environment, and the remanent intraparticle porosity is filled by calcite cement (Fig. 5c). The micrite matrix exhibits a brown to dark orange luminescence, whereas the intraparticle micrite sediment shows an orange luminescence and the cement has a non-to bright yellow zonation (Fig. 5d).\nThe Upper Cretaceous post-rift (pre-orogenic) sequence includes five sedimentary formations, which are known as the Santa Fe, the Reguard, the Congost, the Collada Gass\u00f3 and the Sant Corneli Formations. The Santa Fe Fm., including wackestones, locally packstones with calcispheres and planktonic foraminifera, exhibits a very dark orange luminescence. The Reguard Fm. consists of mudstones, locally wackestones, made up of foraminifera (mainly miliolids) and showing a dark brown luminescence. The Congost Fm. is made up of packstones, locally grainstones formed of bivalves, foraminifera, echinoderms, corals, bryozoans and partially to totally micritized components (i.e., peloids) (Fig. 5e). The micritic matrix and the inter- and intraparticle blocky calcite cement are dark brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 5f). The Collada Gass\u00f3 Fm. is formed of grainstones made up of gastropods, bivalves, echinoids, corals, bryozoans, miliolids, peloids, and locally quartz grains. The inter- and intraparticle porosity is cemented by blocky calcite cement, which exhibits a bright yellow luminescence, whereas the skeletal components display a dull to bright brown luminescence. The Sant Corneli Fm. is divided in two members (the Montagut Mb and the Aramunt Vell Mb). The Montagut Mb. consists of peloidal wackestones to packstones with abundant presence of rudists, miliolids, corals, equinoderms and local quartz detrital components. Under cathodoluminescence, these packstones exhibit a dark to bright brown color. The Aramunt Vell Mb. consists of bioclatic grainstones with variable quartz content and abundant presence of miliolids, bryozoans, equinoderms and bivalves. The interparticle calcite cement is blocky and displays a dark orange luminescence.\nThe Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene syn-orogenic successions include the Vallcarga Formation, the Areny Group and the Tremp Group (Garumnian facies). The Vallcarga Formation consist of mudstones that are brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 5g\u2013h). The Areny Group, in the study localities, is composed of grainstones made up of peloids, local bryozoans and miliolids, and upward increasing detrital quartz content. The interparticle blocky calcite cement is bright yellow luminescent. The Tremp Group (i.e., Garumnian facies) is constituted of fluvial-alluvial and lacustrine detrital and carbonate rocks. Detrital units include versicolored clays with abundant Microcodium, fine-grained sandstones and polymictic conglomerates. Carbonate units include red nodular mudstones, grey wackestones with charophytes and oncolytic packstones.\n\n\n4.3\nFracture analysis\nThe folded sequence within the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline is affected by several fracture sets that include the main reverse, strike slip and normal faults affecting the anticline (the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system and the Sant Joan fault system) and the background deformation (centimetric to metric fractures). We use the term \u201cfracture\u201d or \u201cjoint\u201d to include fractures that show no evidence of shear, and we use the term \u201cfault\u201d to exclusively include shear fractures (Bons et al., 2012). The main fracture and fault characteristics (type, orientation, kinematics, and crosscutting relationships) and their distribution within the anticline are described below.\nThrust faults are important deformation features affecting the frontal part of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (in the Setcomelles, Forat de B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca localities). Thrusts are E-W trending and south verging reverse faults dipping between 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 towards the north. These faults include the main B\u00f3ixols thrust that has been associated with the growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Although most of the B\u00f3ixols fault trace has been buried by syn-orogenic deposits, its frontal ramp crops out between B\u00f3ixols and Sallent villages (Setcomelles locality) juxtaposing Jurassic rocks of the hanging wall with Upper Cretaceous carbonates of the footwall. In this locality, the B\u00f3ixols thrust zone is around 15-m-thick and contains a 2-m-thick fault core characterized by a dark grey to greenish fine-grained foliated gouge featuring well-developed S\u2013C structures that indicate top-to-the S and SSE reverse kinematics.\nIn the Forat the B\u00f3ixols and in Abella de la Conca localities, the B\u00f3ixols thrust displaces, and postdate, the vertical to overturned southern forelimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline generating well-exposed fault zones. These fault zones consist of up to 7\u00a0m thick light grey and fine-grained foliated gouges characterized by well-developed S\u2013C structures forming sigmoidal lenses or imbricated lithons, which are bounded by pressure-solution seams or stylolites striking WSW-ENE. The orientation of these stylolites suggests an NNW-SSE shortening direction, and the presence of striation surfaces on the main slip planes together with the S\u2013C structures also indicate reverse kinematics towards the S-SE. The damage zones, surrounding these fault cores, are characterized by different sets of systematically and randomly-oriented calcite veins exhibiting an increase in vein density from the protolith towards the fault core, as described in Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al. (2020b).\nAdditionally, strike slip faults are also important deformation features that have been observed in most of the studied localities affecting the different structural and stratigraphic positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In the Montagut and Cal Mestre localities, WNW-ESE right-lateral strike slip faults cut pre-orogenic units. These faults developed during the strike-slip reactivation of earlier extensional faults due to their favorable orientation with respect to N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction as evidenced by the presence of slickenlines and striae sets showing crosscutting relationships (Martinez Martinez Casas et al., 2019; Nardini et al., 2019; Tavani et al., 2011). In other localities, N\u2013S to NW-SE and less abundant NE-SW strike slip faults are mainly subvertical, regardless of the bedding dips, and show displacements from a few centimeters up to several meters. Deformation associated with these faults is either localized on discrete polished slip surfaces or accommodated along an up to 1-m-thick fault cores formed of brittle incohesive fault rocks. Sub-horizontal slickenlines present on the slip planes indicate pure strike-slip, and locally oblique-slip, kinematics. These faults affect pre-orogenic units in the backlimb (Montagut and Sant Joan localities) and the hinge (Cal Mestre locality) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and syn-orogenic units (Sant Antoni and Coll de Narg\u00f3 localities).\nNormal faults widely occur in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In the pre- and syn-rift sequence (B\u00f3ixols and Cal Mestre localities), normal faults strike WNW-ESE to NW-SE and dip 40\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 towards the NE and SW. These faults include the Organy\u00e0 fault, preserved next to the axial surface of the anticline juxtaposing Jurassic pre-rift and Lower Cretaceous syn-rift sequences, and meter-scale normal faults that only affect the Lower Cretaceous (syn-rift) Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation. In the backlimb of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, normal faults have been observed around the Montagut and the Sant Joan fault systems (Montagut and Sant Joan localities, respectively) cutting the Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic sequence. In the Montagut locality, metric to decametric NNW-SSE extensional faults dip 50\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 either towards the SW or NE. Deformation associated with these faults is mainly localized in discrete slip planes exhibiting subvertical striae sets or in centimetric fault cores constituted of grey to reddish calcite-cemented breccias. In the San Joan locality, metric to decametric NNE-SSW to NE-SW extensional faults dip around 60\u00b0 towards the NW and SE. These faults present subvertical striae sets indicating dip-slip kinematics and have also been observed in the Santa Fe syncline (i.e., in the north of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline). Finally, WNW-ESE extensional faults dipping between 40\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 towards the NE and SW have been locally observed in the syn-orogenic succession in the Sant Antoni locality and locally in the syn-orogenic sequence from the Abella de la Conca locality.\nBed-parallel slip surfaces are commonly developed between well-bedded layers of marls and marly limestones in the syn-rift sequence (Cal Mestre locality) and the base of the syn-orogenic sequence (Sant Antoni and Abella de la Conca localities) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. These surfaces correspond to centimeter-thick and striated discrete planes cemented by calcite.\nOther mesostructures occurring in most structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline correspond to calcite-cemented fractures (i.e., veins) oriented at high angle with respect to bedding. NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW centimetric vein systems dipping between 50\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 have been observed in the backlimb and forelimb of the anticline (Sant Joan and Coll de Narg\u00f3 localities, respectively) affecting pre-orogenic units. These veins have regular shapes and show openings ranging from 1 to 15\u00a0mm. E-W to WSW- ENE calcite veins are also present in the pre-orogenic unit (Cal Mestre locality) and in the syn-orogenic sequence (Orcau and Abella de la Conca localities). These veins are up to 1\u00a0m long and less than 1\u00a0cm thick. In the Orcau locality, veins with similar NW-SE orientation show crosscutting relationships suggesting development of similar fractures during successive fracturing events.\n\n\n4.4\nPetrographic description of vein cements\nThe petrographic description of the different vein cements from fractures using optical and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopes is summarized in this section and in Fig. 6\n.\nCalcite cements precipitated within faults and related fractures across the B\u00f3ixols-San Corneli anticline are characterized by elongated to fibrous crystals ranging in size from 0.1 to 7\u00a0mm, although most common crystals are less than 2\u00a0mm (Fig. 6a). Luminescence features of these cements are generally very homogeneous and vary from dark brown to bright yellow, being dull orange to dark yellow the most common colors observed under CL (Fig. 6b).\nCements from veins that precipitated in bed-parallel slip surfaces share similar petrographic characteristics throughout the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. These cements, which consist of up to 5\u00a0mm elongated to fibrous calcite crystals arranged parallel to both the vein walls and the bedding surfaces, are dark brown to non-luminescent (Fig. 6c\u2013d).\nCalcite cements precipitated in centimetric to metric non shear fractures are mainly characterized by blocky to elongated blocky crystals ranging in size from 0.2 to 5\u00a0mm and locally displaying mechanical twining (Fig. 6e\u2013f). Elongated blocky calcites have been observed in different veins exhibiting elongation direction perpendicular to fracture walls and indicating the mode I opening of the vein (Bons et al., 2012) (Fig. 6f). Under CL, cements within non-shear fractures display three kind of luminescence colors: (i) dark brown to non-luminescence; (ii) orange to bright yellow; and (iii) a non-luminescent to bright yellow concentric zonation (Fig. 6g\u2013h).\nBesides, it is worth noting two correlations observed between the luminescence features of the vein cements and the structural position of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli fold. First, all cements from fractures present in two localities (Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, which are found in the fold hinge and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust, respectively) exhibit a dark brown to non-luminescence. This is the case, for instance, of the veins from bed-parallel slip surfaces explained above (Fig. 6c\u2013d). Second, all cements showing a non-luminescent to bright yellow concentric zonation are found in fractures present in the limbs of the anticline, this is, in Sant Joan and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities as shown in Fig. 6g\u2013h.\n\n\n4.5\nGeochemistry of calcite cements and host rocks\nStable (\u03b418O and \u03b413C) and clumped (\u039447) isotopes, 87Sr\/86Sr ratios and elemental composition of the successive calcite veins and related host rocks are summarized in Figs. 7\u20139\n\n\n and in the supplementary data. In order to discuss all the complexity of the geochemical values, the studied calcite cements have been assembled in three groups (Figs. 7\u20139), according to similarities of the main geochemical features:\nGroup 1 includes dark to non-luminescent calcite cements, similar to their adjacent marine host rocks, either the Lower Cretaceous marls of the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation or the Upper Cretaceous marls of the Vallcarga Formation. These cements also show \u03b413C values and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios similar to their adjacent host rocks, which are typical of marine carbonates (Figs. 7 and 8) (Veizer et al., 1999). They are also characterized by Sr contents higher than 1100\u00a0ppm, Mn contents lower than 200\u00a0ppm, and Y\/Ho ratios higher than 50 (Fig. 9). The \u03b418O values of Group 1 cements are similar to or up to 5 \u2030VPDB lighter than those values of their correspondent host rocks (Figs. 7 and 8b). Their geochemistry generally reflects the composition of their host carbonates. Cements from Group 1 are all cements from fractures and faults present in the hinge of the anticline (Cal Mestre locality) and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (Sant Antoni locality). In addition, 9 representative samples of this Group were analyzed to reconstruct the temperature and composition of the fluids precipitating these cements using clumped isotope measurements. In the hinge of the anticline (5 samples), the obtained \u039447 values range from 0.456 to 0.567\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.028, which translates into precipitation temperatures ranging from 36 to 85\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22124.7 to +3.8 \u2030SMOW. In the base of the syn-orogenic deposits from the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (4 samples) the \u039447 values vary from 0.404\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.022 to 0.509\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015, which indicates precipitation temperatures ranging from 59 to 116\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid from +5.3 to +6.5 \u2030SMOW.\nGroup 2 includes cements that show the lightest \u03b418O values, from \u221214 \u2030VPDB to \u22128 \u2030VPDB, which are up to 10 \u2030VPDB lighter than their correspondent host rocks (Figs. 7 and 8b). These cements have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios between 0.7074 and 0.7080 (Fig. 8a\u2013b), and \u03b413C between \u221212 \u2030VPDB and +2 \u2030VPDB, which may either be similar or lighter than those values of their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 7). Additionally, comparing all cements, calcites from Group 2 exhibit low to intermediate Sr contents (between 390 and 2000\u00a0ppm), intermediate Mn contents (less than 700\u00a0ppm), and intermediate Y\/Ho ratios (between 40 and 80) (Fig. 9a\u2013c). All these calcite cements precipitated in large-scale faults and related fractures affecting different sectors of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Eleven representative clumped isotope measurements of Group 2 cements were completed with 4 previously reported measurements in the area (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019) to reconstruct the temperature and composition of the precipitating fluids. Obtained \u039447 values range from 0.413\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009 to 0.529\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, which correspond to precipitation temperatures ranging from 50 to 110\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22124.3 to +4.2 \u2030SMOW.\nGroup 3 of calcites (Figs. 7\u20139) includes cements characterized by a narrow range of the \u03b418O values, between \u22128 and \u22126\u2030 VPDB (Figs. 7 and 8b), and \u03b413C-depleted values, between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02\u2030 VPDB, which are up to 10\u2030 VPDB lighter than their surrounding host rocks (Fig. 7). The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of these calcites, between 0.7073 and 0.7077, are lower than values of their correspondent host rocks but within the range of Cretaceous carbonates, which range between 0.7072 and 0.7079, approximately (McArthur et al., 2012) (Fig. 8a\u2013b). Finally, these cements display the lowest Sr contents (less than 500\u00a0ppm) and Y\/Ho ratios (less than 60) (Fig. 9). Cements from Group 3 precipitated in centimetric to metric-scale fractures in the backlimb (Sant Joan locality) and forelimb (Coll de Narg\u00f3 and Forat de B\u00f3ixols localities) of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The previous contributions of (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b; Nardini et al., 2019) also reported the temperature of precipitation and composition of the parent fluids for four cements from Group 3 and these data has been complemented with a new clumped isotope measurement. Obtained \u039447 values range from 0.494\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.016 to 0.646\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, which correspond to precipitation temperatures ranging from 40 to 85\u00a0\u00b0C and \u03b418Ofluid varying from \u22121.3 to +4.8 \u2030SMOW.\n\n\n\n5\nU\u2013Pb geochronology of fracture-filling calcite cements\nTwenty-three ages were obtained for different fracture-filling calcite cements (Fig. 10\n), varying from Late Cretaceous (79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma) to late Miocene (9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma). These U\u2013Pb ages were acquired for calcite cements from Group 2 (18 out of 23), which precipitated along the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system and other large faults affecting the entire anticline (Fig. 10), and for cements from Group 1 (3 out of 23) and from Group 3 (2 out of 23). These results together with eight previously published dates (Cruset et al., 2020a,b; Haines, 2008) provide a well constrained absolute timing of deformation and fluid flow in the frontal anticline of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (Fig. 10).\nCalcite cements and clay minerals were dated in the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Setcomelles, Forat de B\u00f3ixols and Abella de la Conca localities. At Setcomelles, previously Ar\u2013Ar dating of clays sampled in a fault core, yielded an age of 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0Ma (Haines, 2008), whereas an U\u2013Pb age of 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma was obtained at Forat de B\u00f3ixols (Cruset et al., 2020b). Both dates are older than the new U\u2013Pb age reported in this study for the B\u00f3ixols thrust at Abella de la Conca (36.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0Ma).\nIn the several faults that constitute the Montagut fault system, which affect the Upper Cretaceous pre-orogenic sequence at the Montagut locality, we obtained 13 U\u2013Pb dates. These dates present important age variations from the oldest one during the Late Cretaceous at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to the youngest one during the late Miocene at 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma. Using this dataset, which has been completed with two previously published dates of the area, we report the formation and\/or reactivation of normal faults and related fluid flow at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma, 48.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u00a0Ma to 43.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma, 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to 16.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0Ma and 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). Therefore, the Late Cretaceous date (79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma) is: (i) the oldest obtained age in this contribution and, (ii) older than the first age documented for the B\u00f3ixols thrust (71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0Ma, Haines, 2008). Ages for the Organy\u00e0 fault and other pre-orogeny fractures were not obtained in this study. In the same way, at the Montagut locality, we document the formation and\/or reactivation of strike-slip faults during precipitation of calcite cements at 58.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Ma, 45.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0Ma to 37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0Ma and 27.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0Ma. The precipitation of calcite cement in strike-slip faults during the Lutetian, coincides with the formation of similar strike-slip faults in other localities, according to the age of their related cements at 43.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0Ma (Sant Joan locality) and 45.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7 (Sant Antoni locality).\nAt the Sant Joan locality, we did not obtain ages for the Sant Joan fault system. However, we measured two dates for calcite veins at 67.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0Ma and 65.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0Ma, which precipitated in metric fractures in this locality. The former age has a mean squared weighted deviate (MSWD) of 10.6. As this value is higher than 2, it could indicate a mixing of ages, an open system, or an incomplete initial equilibration of the Pb isotopes (Rasbury and Cole, 2009).\nOther obtained ages in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline account for the background deformation represented by fracture systems at different scales and studied at distinct localities. In this line, we document the formation of layer-parallel slip surfaces at 61.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.8\u00a0Ma in Cal Mestre Locality. Similarly, we also report the formation and\/or reactivation of meter-scale fractures during the Late Cretaceous to Oligocene, according to precipitation of calcite cements at 67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0Ma, 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, 44.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma to 43.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0Ma and 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10).\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nSequence of deformation and age and duration of fold evolution\nIn this section we stablish the sequence of fracturing based on field data and structural observations and provide absolute age constraints from the U\u2013Pb dating of calcite veins in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline.\nFirstly, we use relative chronological relationships to determine whether the studied fracture and fault systems developed prior, during or after the main folding stage. It must be highlighted that fractures in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline are controlled by the presence of inherited extensional structures, resulting in fractures that do not preserve a symmetrical orientation with respect to the local fold axis (Nardini et al., 2019; Shackleton et al., 2011; Tavani et al., 2011). Therefore, the approaches used to determine the relative age of fracture development are: (i) the crosscutting relationships between different fracture and striae sets; (ii) the relation between fracture orientation and bedding attitude; and (iii) the restriction of fractures to specific pre- and\/or syn-orogenic units. Following these assumptions, we summarize the fold evolution in four stages of deformation, which are in line with previous studies describing the evolution of folds in fold-and-thrust belts (Amrouch et al., 2010; Beaudoin et al., 2015, 2020; Casini et al., 2011; Lacombe et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015):\nPre-orogenic extension: the WNW-ESE to NNW-SSE normal faults in the B\u00f3ixols and Cal Mestre localities only affect pre- and syn-rift (pre-orogenic) units and are consistent with the NNE-SSW extensional regime that predates the Pyrenean compression (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990). Accordingly, these faults have previously been associated with an Early Cretaceous rifting in the area (Ber\u00e1stegui et al., 1990; Garc\u00eda-Senz, 2002).\nLayer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stage: during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, slip directions provided by fault orientations and related slickenlines are consistent with a N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction (Fig. 10), which agrees with the regional tectonic transport direction in the Pyrenees (Choukroune, 1989; Macchiavelli et al., 2017; Srivastava et al., 1990). The estimated stress field calculated for the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust evidences a SSE transport direction, compatible with the estimated N\u2013S to NNW-SSE shortening direction, and a subhorizontal maximum principal stress. The orientation of the conjugate NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, showing a subhorizontal \u03c31, is compatible with the shortening direction reported for the B\u00f3ixols thrust (Fig. 10), and the similar petrographic and geochemical features of the calcite cements found within these conjugate fractures and the B\u00f3ixols thrust accounts for a synchronous development. Besides, opening fractures with similar NNW-SSE orientations developed during successive fracturing events, as evidenced by crosscutting relationships between their associated vein cements (e.g., Fig. 6e). These opening fractures likely developed with a horizontal least compressive principal stress and thus, during compression (Anderson, 1951). Previous studies already reported the formation of NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW fractures during the main folding stage in the western termination of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Shackleton et al., 2011). These NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW fracture orientations have been interpreted as controlled by the regional shortening direction and by inherited extensional structures, respectively (Tavani et al., 2011).\nOther deformation structures, interpreted as developed during the layer parallel shortening and main folding stages include the formation of bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, which is indicative of flexural-slip commonly associated with the main folding stage (Tavani et al., 2011, 2017) as well as the strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults that developed during the pre-orogenic deformation. This reactivation, which is supported by the presence of overprinting striae sets exhibiting oblique-slip and strike-slip kinematics and by the coexistence of two calcite cements in the same fractures, was likely caused due to their favorable orientation with respect to the shortening direction during inversion. In the same way, fractures exhibiting an E-W orientation that is parallel to the fold axis have been associated with local extension due to strata bending, as interpreted other anticlines elsewhere (Beaudoin et al., 2015).\nFold tightening stage: this late deformation stage is represented by fractures that are still consistent with a NNW-SSE shortening direction but are characterized by a constant orientation independently of the bedding dips, and by large faults offsetting the already folded beds of the anticline. These features are indicative of a fold tightening stage (Amrouch et al., 2010; Beaudoin et al., 2020; Casini et al., 2011; Lacombe et al., 2021; Tavani et al., 2015). At this stage, the ongoing shortening is expected to be oriented at a high angle with respect to bedding and the resulting deformation has been interpreted as accommodated by: (i) the formation of thrust faults (B\u00f3ixols thrust in the Forat de B\u00f3ixols and the Abella de la Conca localities), offsetting the steeply dipping forelimb of the anticline; and (ii) strike-slip faults exhibiting subhorizontal striae sets and recording a subhorizontal maximum principal stress regardless of the bedding dips across the anticline (Fig. 10).\nPost-folding normal faulting: normal faults displace already folded beds in the backlimb of the anticline (the Sant Joan fault system and subsidiary faults around the Montagut fault system) in the Sant Joan and Montagut localities, respectively. As this extensional faulting postdate strata tilting, these faults have been attributed to a post-folding extensional stage that could be associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli structure (Mencos, 2010). As reported in other areas elsewhere, positive uplift may induce gravity-driven extension that mainly affects the limbs of anticlines (Morley, 2007; Tavani et al., 2014, 2015).\nBeyond this, U\u2013Pb chronology of the successive vein cements allowed us to refine the absolute timing of vein development, which is in line with the sequence of deformation interpreted from the structural analysis, and to link the four deformation stages in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline with the regional deformation of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet during the evolution of the South-Central Pyrenees. The collected samples of the normal faults interpreted as pre-orogenic deformation have not given measurable ages. Thereby, we provide absolute U\u2013Pb age constraints for the layer parallel shortening and subsequent folding stage, for the late stage of fold tightening and for the post-folding normal faulting, as summarized below.\nThe succession of U\u2013Pb ages measured in calcite veins that precipitated in fractures attributed to the layer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages range from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). These ages are coeval with the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata deposition along the southern flank of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Thus, corroborating the formation of: (i) conjugated NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, (ii) bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, (iii) E-W bed-perpendicular fractures trending parallel to the fold axis, and (iv) strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front during Late Cretaceous to Paleocene times. This is also consistent with previous estimates placing the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols trust sheet and its eastern equivalent structure, the Upper Pedraforca thrust sheet, from 70.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 to 55.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0Ma (Cruset et al., 2020b).\nAdditionally, a sample from the NNW-SSE Montagut fault system, in the region of relay between the anticlines of B\u00f3ixols and Sant Corneli, has given an age of 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (middle Campanian). This age is the oldest associated with a normal fault in the study region and therefore synchronous with the well-preserved Late Cretaceous growth strata deposits at the SW end of the Sant Corneli anticline. Indeed, NW-SE normal faults have also been observed deforming Upper Cretaceous syn-orogenic sediments in the Sant Antoni locality, in the western end of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The formation of the former NNW-SSE normal faults is consistent with the formation of extensional structures oriented parallel to the shortening direction (Tavani et al., 2011). The development of the later NW-SE faults is consistent tectonic instability and basin margin collapse during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and the initial stages of fold growth (Bond and McClay, 1995; Guillaume et al., 2008; Shackleton et al., 2011).\nThe U\u2013Pb ages ranging from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma postdate the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata that fossilizes the B\u00f3ixols structure (Fig. 10). This corroborates the formation of thrust faults offsetting the forelimb of the anticline (B\u00f3ixols thrust in the Forat de B\u00f3ixols and the Abella de la Conca localities) and strike-slip faults across the fold during the tightening of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet including its frontal B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline in Eocene and Oligocene times. This fold tightening is therefore coeval with the tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet to the south over the basal thrust of the South-Central Pyrenean Unit during a period that is characterized by maximum shortening rates (Cruset et al., 2020b; Grool et al., 2018; Verg\u00e9s et al., 2002). During this period, we also report the formation and\/reactivation of NNW-SSE normal faults, NW-SE strike slip faults and E-W to WNW-ESE opening veins, suggesting that these structures successively developed during the entire folding event (Fig. 10).\nU\u2013Pb dating of normal faults interpreted as post-folding structures reveals their formation at 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). Coeval deformation has been documented in the SE Pyrenean thrust sheets through the reactivation of thrust faults and the growth of collapse normal faults dated by means of U\u2013Pb geochronology (Cruset et al., 2020b).\nTo sum up, we interpret the evolution of fractures in the study area as a record of the pre-orogenic deformation, developed previously to 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma (Fig. 11\n). Our data also reveal the layer parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages, which lasted at least from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front (Fig. 11). The late stage of fold tightening from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma, coeval with the tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet to the south over the South-Central Pyrenean Unit basal thrust. Therefore, the absolute dating of mesostructures presented in this study not only corroborates the sequence of deformation interpreted from the field and structural data but also allowed us to provide new constraints on the age and duration of the entire folding event (Lacombe et al., 2021). Thus, we suggest that the layer parallel shortening and folding substages lasted for about 14 Myr, whereas the late fold tightening had a duration of about 28 Myr. This indicates that the entire folding event lasted at least 42 Myr (Fig. 11). These interpretations are in line with recent studies estimating the duration of fold growth in the Pyrenees and elsewhere using direct dating of vein cements (Lacombe et al., 2021).\nBesides, it is worth nothing that this study evidences the continuous formation of similar fracture and fault systems throughout the folding process. Likewise, we report the precipitation of calcite cements with similar petrographic and geochemical features that developed during different deformation stages. Therefore, we conclude that without the absolute timing constraints provided by U\u2013Pb geochronology, different fractures and different fluid flow events that occurred in the several stages of fold evolution would potentially be interpreted as occurred coevally during the same substage of folding. This, therefore, has important implications for the prediction of fracture development and associated fluid flow migrations.\n\n\n6.2\nOpen vs closed fluid behavior and relative extent of fluid-rock interactions\nThe presence of different calcite vein generations developed during the structural evolution of the study area, as well as the wide range of U\u2013Pb ages and isotopic and elemental composition of the vein cements, evidence a complex evolution of the fluid system throughout the entire deformation history.\nIn the Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, present in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits in the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet, respectively, the calcite cements associated with successive episodes of fracturing and vein formation (i.e., Group 1 calcites) do not record significant changes in the cement composition through time (Figs. 7\u20139). Accordingly, all cements from this Group 1 have similar \u03b413C values to their associated carbonate host rocks (Llu\u00e7\u00e0 and Vallcarga Formations, respectively), which in turn yield typical marine values (Fig. 7) (Veizer et al., 1999). The 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the vein cements are similar to those ratios of local host rocks, which also reflect the composition of contemporaneous seawater (LOWESS curve in Fig. 8a). Indeed, the low Mn content of calcites Group 1 and related host rocks, responsible for their dark to non-luminescence, together with their high Sr content (Fig. 9a\u2013b) and high Y\/Ho ratios (Fig. 9c), reveal to be close to the elemental composition of marine carbonates derived from well-oxygenated seawater (Popp et al., 1986). Therefore, the similar petrographic and geochemical features of all calcite cements and host rocks from Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities indicate very low water-rock ratios (i.e., diffusive flow) and precipitation of successive calcite cements in a relatively closed\/rock-buffered system during different fracturing events (Boutoux et al., 2014; Hurai et al., 2015; Vandeginste et al., 2012). In this scenario, the slight \u03b418O-depletion of calcites Group 1 (Fig. 7a), with respect to host rocks and typical marine values, indicates variation in fluid temperatures, from 36 and up to 116\u00a0\u00b0C, and locally in the fluid composition, from \u22124.7 to +6.5 \u2030SMOW, during different events of calcite cement precipitation, as revealed by clumped isotope data. Variations in temperature are expected during different stages of deformation linked to the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. In contrast, the positive \u03b418Ofluid-values, measured in most calcites from Group 1 (Fig. 8c), indicate the presence of formation waters, which is consistent with a scenario mainly involving evolved marine fluids likely trapped in the surrounding Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates present in Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities, respectively. Locally, the negative \u03b418Ofluid-values, measured in two cements from Group 1 (Fig. 8c), likely indicate the infiltration of meteoric waters during the main folding and late fold tightening stages (Fig. 10). However, the similar isotopic and elemental signature between these two cements, the other cements from Group 1 and the adjacent marine host rocks indicate that the fluids precipitating in these veins migrated at relative low rates to equilibrate with the adjacent sedimentary formations. Therefore, we suggest that calcites Group 1 precipitated from formation, likely marine-derived fluids, and locally from meteoric waters, the composition of which was buffered by the adjacent Cretaceous marine carbonates.\nThe geochemical data of calcite cements from Group 2, precipitated in decametric to kilometric faults (the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system, the Sant Joan fault system) and related fractures, evidence a different scenario than that of Group 1 cements. Calcites from Group 2 generally display the more depleted \u03b418O values with respect to those of Group 1 and exhibit up to 10 \u2030VPDB lighter values than their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 7). This \u03b418O-depletion is related to the relative high temperature of precipitation, up to 120\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that the fluids precipitating calcites Group 2 migrated rapid enough through fault zones to avoid efficient isotopic equilibration with surrounding host rocks (Beaudoin et al., 2011). On the other hand, the scattered \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of Group 2 cements (Figs. 7\u20138), their variable enrichment in Mn contents (Fig. 9b), and their differing luminescence characteristics could indicate that the precipitating fluids had distinct fluid origins (marine, connate and\/or meteoric) and that they interacted with different sedimentary units (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Vandeginste et al., 2012). The variable origin of the precipitating fluids is recorded in the \u03b418Ofluid, which yield values, between \u22124.4 and\u00a0+\u00a04.3 \u2030SMOW, that is between the range of meteoric, marine and formation waters. Similarly, the Y\/Ho ratios of Group 2 of cements indicate a variable degree of siliciclastic and marine influence (Fig. 9c). As large-scale faults affect all stratigraphic sequences involved in the anticline, from Jurassic marine to Paleocene continental host rocks, such variation may result from the interaction between the vein-forming fluids and marine (high Y\/Ho ratio) or continental (low Y\/Ho ratio) rocks (Bau, 1994; Nardini et al., 2019). Accordingly, we interpret that calcites from Group 2 precipitated from fluids that did not equilibrated geochemically with the host rocks. As this group mainly concerns large faults and related fractures such as the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut fault system, the Sant Joan fault system, among others, these large fractures acted as efficient conduits for fluid migration during their formation at different stages of the deformation history.\nCements from Group 3 precipitated in centimetric to metric scale fractures in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, where Upper Cretaceous post-rift (pre-orogenic) marine carbonates are widely exposed. The isotopic signature of these cements, ranging between \u22128 and \u22126 \u2030VPDB for \u03b418O and between \u221210 and\u00a0+\u00a02 \u2030VPDB for \u03b413C, fall within the range of meteoric carbonates (Pujalte et al., 2009; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007; Veizer, 2005), although with varying influence of the marine host rocks as evidenced by the positive \u03b413C values of some cements (Fig. 7). The meteoric origin of cements from Group 3 is supported by their 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, which are lower than those values of their adjacent host rocks (Fig. 8a), and by the elemental composition of these cements, yielding the lowest Sr contents with respect to other cements and host rocks. The low Y\/Ho ratios, which indicates the influence of terrigenous sediments (Bau, 1994), and their common CL zonation (Fig. 6), which points to oxidizing-reducing fluctuations, are again characteristic features of the meteoric environment. At outcrop scale, clumped isotopes reveal a progressive increase in precipitation temperatures, from 40\u00a0\u00b0C to 80\u00a0\u00b0C (Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality) and from 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 85\u00a0\u00b0C approximately (Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality), as well as an enrichment in \u03b418Ofluid, from \u22121.8 to +5.9 \u2030VSMOW and from \u22124.2 to +2 \u2030VSMOW, respectively (Fig. 8c). This fact indicates a continuous shift in the fluid composition, from meteoric to evolved meteoric fluids due to water-rock interactions at increasing temperatures during deformation. Therefore, these geochemical features indicate that the fluid system associated with metric fractures that developed in the limbs of the anticline, was open to the input of meteoric fluids, which geochemistry was influenced by the surrounding Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates.\n\n\n6.3\nSpatio-temporal variation of fluids across the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline\nIn this section, we discuss the distribution and variations of fluids in the distinct structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline.\nThe host-rock buffered fluids from which calcites Group 1 precipitated characterizes the paleohydrological system in the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits along the southern flank of the fold, where Cal Mestre and Sant Antoni localities are located, respectively (Fig. 12\n). In the hinge of the anticline (Cal Mestre locality), the Lower Cretaceous mudstones and marls from the Llu\u00e7\u00e0 Formation have a minimum thickness of 2500\u00a0m (Lanaja, 1987). Due to the expected non-permeable character of this unit and its considerable thickness, the small-scale fractures (up to several meters long) occurring in this locality, likely represented poorly efficient conduits to connect different hydro-stratigraphic reservoirs and to prevent isotopic equilibration between fluids and host rocks. A similar rock-buffered fluid behavior has been observed in the core of the el Guix anticline in the Ebro foreland basin, where the \u03b413C and \u03b418O values of fracture-filling calcites are in geochemical equilibrium with their adjacent host carbonates (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2000). Contrarily, in the crestal and shallower domains of anticlines, the fluid system is often the opposite. Examples of this are the Puig-reig anticline, also in the Ebro foreland basin, and the Pico del \u00c1guila anticline in the Sierras Exteriores (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016). These authors concluded that large faults and well-connected fracture networks that developed in response to outer arc extension at fold hinges during fold growth facilitated the opening of the fluid system and the percolation of meteoric fluids in disequilibrium with their adjacent host rocks. These observations, together with that of this study, reveal the compartmentalization of fold structures during deformation.\nIn the base of the syn-orogenic deposits (Sant Antoni locality), the Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones from the Vallcarga Formation were deposited during the early contraction and initial growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline (Ard\u00e8vol et al., 2000). Therefore, the local origin of the fluids in this domain is consistent with the marine setting of deformation that likely affected recently deposited and poorly lithified sediments (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007).\nFluids with limited geochemical interactions with adjacent host rocks from which calcites Group 2 precipitated characterize the fluid system associated with large-scale faults and related fractures, which affect the different structural and stratigraphic positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and developed throughout its whole deformation history (Fig. 12). The development of these large fracture systems facilitated the transfer of fluids between different hydro-stratigraphic units decreasing the extent of interaction between fluids and host rocks, as has already been documented in the frontal domain of the anticline. In this line, according to Nardini et al. (2019), large strike-slip faults from Coll de Narg\u00f3 locality acted as transfer zones for the migration of deeper Late Cretaceous connate waters to shallower non-marine sediments of the Paleocene Garumnian facies. Likewise, the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality acted as an efficient longitudinal conduit for the migration of deep formation waters also derived from Cretaceous carbonates (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). In both examples, these large faults enhanced connectivity between different sedimentary units, allowing heated formation fluids to migrate upward through fault zones with limited equilibration with adjacent rocks (Nardini et al., 2019; Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). These fluids were likely expelled due to vertical compaction linked to thrust sheet emplacement and\/or tectonic horizontal shortening (squeegee-type fluid flow) during continuous compression (; Machel and Cavell, 1999; Oliver, 1986; Roure et al., 2010; Smeraglia et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Trav\u00e9 et al., 1997, 1998; Vandeginste et al., 2012).\nFinally, meteoric and evolved meteoric waters from which calcites Group 3 precipitated characterizes the fluid system in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline, where Forat the B\u00f3ixols, Coll de Narg\u00f3 and Sant Joan localities are located (Fig. 12). Meteoric waters generally infiltrate at high structural reliefs such as the crestal domain of anticlines (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Cruset et al., 2016). However, in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline meteoric fluid percolation was mainly recorded in the fold limbs, and locally in the fold hinge, because most of the crestal domain was eroded synchronously with folding (Tavani et al., 2011). On the other hand, the geochemical and geochronological data of some calcite cements from Group 3 set the initial infiltration of meteoric fluids during the Maastrichtian, during formation of their related fractures at ca. 67\u201365\u00a0Ma (Fig. 10). This fluid flow event coincides with the transition from marine to continental conditions, during the progressive uplift of the structure, coevally with sedimentation of the non-marine continental Garumnian facies (Tremp Group) from Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene (Garc\u00e9s et al., 2020; Plaziat, 1981). Therefore, the emersion of the B\u00f3ixols structure has been recorded by the fluids that migrated through fractures during deformation. This scenario of meteoric fluid infiltration during the main folding stage and during the change from marine to continental conditions have also been reported in other studies focused on the evolution of fold-fluid systems (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Evans and Fischer, 2012; Nardini et al., 2019; Trav\u00e9 et al., 1998, 2007).\nIn conclusion, our data reveal that the fluid flow history and the extent of fluid-rock interaction varied at the several structural positions of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and according to the age and nature of their stratigraphy and the involved fracture networks. This indicates a compartmentalization of the fluid system (Fig. 12). Thus, in the hinge of the fold, at least around Cal Mestre locality, and in the base of the syn-orogenic deposits (Sant Joan locality), the fluid system was locally derived and\/or well equilibrated with the host rocks, revealing a high extent of fluid-rock interaction. These local\/rock-buffered fluids were basically evolved marine and\/or connate waters derived from the adjacent Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous marine carbonates, although influences of meteoric waters were also locally present. Contrarily, along large faults, affecting different parts of the anticline, and in the fold limbs, the paleohydrological system was different. Large faults acted as conduits for the migration of fluids with limited chemical interactions with adjacent host rocks, suggesting that these faults have been efficient conduits for upward fluid flow during their development in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. The fold limbs registered the infiltration and evolution of meteoric waters with varying degrees of fluid-rock interactions at increasing temperatures during deformation (Fig. 12). Therefore, our data suggest that in the studied anticline the relative scale and distribution of fracture networks together with the involved stratigraphy were the main controls on the source, the distribution of fluids and the degree of fluid-rock interactions during deformation.\n\n\n6.4\nScale of fluid flow and comparison with other compressional settings\nIn this section, we evaluate the scale of fluid flow in rocks forming the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and compare our results with other Pyrenean structures and other worldwide compressional belts. The B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet corresponds to the uppermost and oldest emplaced structure of the southern-central Pyrenean cover thrust units. Therefore, the structural position of this thrust sheet, detached along the Upper Triassic evaporites and above Lower Triassic detrital sediments of the Buntsandstein and the Paleozoic basement, allows us to assess the possible input of external fluids derived from these three potential reservoirs. In a previous section, we concluded that advective fluid flow was linked to the presence of major fault zones (including the B\u00f3ixols thrust) and associated fractures, which acted as preferential fluid flow pathways. Therefore, the geochemical signature of calcite cements precipitated in these fractures (Group 2 calcites) provide evidence on the relative scale of fluid flow and the fluid circulation depth. Thus, during precipitation of Group 2 calcites, a maximum temperature of around 120\u00a0\u00b0C was obtained from clumped isotopes in calcites precipitated in fractures associated with the B\u00f3ixols thrust in Forat de B\u00f3ixols locality (Fig. 8c) (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020b). Assuming a normal geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007), these temperatures would have been reached at 3\u20134\u00a0km depth. Considering the thickness of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet (around 5\u00a0km thick), such temperatures imply circulation of fluids along fault zones that were originated in the deeper parts of the sedimentary cover. Indeed, the \u03b418Ofluid of this group of cements, yielding maximum values of +5.5 \u2030VSMOW, indicate the presence of formation waters, as has been explained before, and discard the input of basement-related fluids such water derived from and\/or equilibrated with metamorphic rocks (Sheppard, 1981). In the same way, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the vein cements documented in this study are (1) within the range of marine carbonates (LOWESS curve in Fig. 8a), (2) within the range of synkinematic veins precipitated in the sedimentary cover (i.e., 87Sr\/86Sr\u00a0<\u00a00.710) (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020a), and (3) significantly lower than values of cements precipitated from fluids that have interacted with Triassic evaporites or with Paleozoic basement rocks (Mu\u00f1oz-L\u00f3pez et al., 2020a). All these observations indicate that the fluid system in the study area was restricted to the scale of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and rule out the input of external fluids derived from the underlying Triassic detachment, from deeper cover units such as the Buntsandstein or from the Paleozoic basement. An exception arises for the cement precipitated in the B\u00f3ixols thrust-related deformation at the Setcomelles locality, which exhibits the most radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr ratio in this study, similar to Upper Triassic values (Fig. 8a). Therefore, fluids derived from Upper Triassic evaporites acting as a main detachment of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet could have locally infiltrated the paleohydrological system, as has also been reported in other salt-detached Pyrenean structures (Crognier et al., 2018; Cruset et al., 2020a; Lacroix et al., 2011; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2007).\nThe results presented in this study also reveal that the frontal anticline (the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline) of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet shares a common fluid flow behavior with other worldwide compressional structures above evaporitic detachments. In these structures, the paleohydrological system only involves fluids sourced above the detachment levels, which may act as a lower boundary for the fluid system, preventing the input of fluids from deeper parts of the compressional belt. This fluid flow scenario in the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet is similar to that of: 1) worldwide detachment folds (Beaudoin et al., 2014); 2) other south Pyrenean structures detached in Triassic and Eocene evaporitic units such as the Pico del \u00c1guila and El Guix anticlines (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Trav\u00e9 et al., 2000), the Monte Perdido and Abocador thrusts (Cruset et al., 2018; Lacroix et al., 2011), and the Upper and Lower Pedraforca thrust sheets (Cruset et al., 2020a); 3) other worldwide detached structures such as the Sierra Madre Oriental (Fischer et al., 2009; Lefticariu et al., 2005) and the Central Appalachians (Evans et al., 2012). Contrarily, in the absence of evaporites, a previous study highlighted that the fluid system is open to migration of hydrothermal, likely basement-derived fluids into the overlaying sedimentary cover (Beaudoin et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nOur field and analytical data allowed to date and to analyze the relationships between fluid flow and fold evolution across different structural domains of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline as summarized below.\n\n1.\nThe successive fracture-filling calcite cements identified in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline were assembled in three calcite groups according to petrological and geochemical data. Group 1 includes calcites with similar petrographic and geochemical features with respect to their host carbonates (i.e., non-luminescent calcite cements with \u03b413C values and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios typical of marine carbonates); Group 2 comprises calcites with the lightest \u03b418O values, down to \u221214 \u2030VPDB, and the highest temperature of precipitation (up to 120\u00a0\u00b0C); and Group 3 includes calcites with \u03b418O from \u22128 to \u22126 \u2030VPDB, \u03b413C down to \u221210 \u2030VPDB and the lowest Sr contents.\n\n\n2.\nThe geochemistry of Group 1 cements indicates an essentially closed and\/or rock buffered fluid system in the Early Cretaceous sequence from the hinge of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline and in the upper Santonian to middle Campanian syn-orogenic sequence along the footwall of the B\u00f3ixols thrust.\n\n\n3.\nThe geochemistry of Group 2 cements indicates an open fluid system along the B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Montagut and the Sant Joan fault systems evidencing that these large faults acted as conduits for the upward migration of formation fluids, which evolved from different fluid origins. Group 3 cements indicate the presence and evolution of meteoric waters in the limbs of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. Meteoric fluids likely infiltrated at high structural reliefs during fold growth.\n\n\n4.\nTwenty-three new U\u2013Pb dates were measured in different sets of fracture-filling calcite cements in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline presenting a wide range of ages from Late Cretaceous at 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0Ma to late Miocene at 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma. These age variations are in line with the sequence of deformation inferred from field and microstructural observations.\n\n\n5.\nTen U\u2013Pb ages measured in calcites from fractures attributed to the layer-parallel shortening and subsequent folding stages range from 71.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 to 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ma, coeval with the upper Santonian to Paleocene growth strata deposition along the southern flank of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline. This confirms the development of (i) conjugated NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW fracture sets, (ii) bed-parallel slip surfaces across the fold, (iii) E-W bed-perpendicular fractures trending parallel to the fold axis, and (iv) strike-slip reactivation of inherited extensional faults, during the emplacement of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet and growth of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline along its front during Late Cretaceous to Paleocene times.\n\n\n6.\nFifteen ages that range from 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0Ma and measured in calcites from fractures that cut already folded beds indicate the late tightening of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline during Eocene and Oligocene periods, coeval with the southern tectonic transport of the B\u00f3ixols thrust sheet in the hanging wall of the South-Central Pyrenean Unit.\n\n\n7.\nThe Miocene ages from 20.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 9.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0Ma from normal faults that displace already folded beds in the backlimb of the anticline have been attributed to a post-folding extensional stage that could be associated with the collapse of the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli structure.\n\n\n8.\nThe U\u2013Pb geochronology allowed us to calculate the entire duration of folding for \u223c42 Myr with layer parallel shortening and folding for about \u223c14 Myr, whereas its tightening lasted around 28 Myr.\n\n\n9.\nThe major B\u00f3ixols thrust, the Coll de Narg\u00f3 strike-slip faults and the Montagut fault system acted as preferential pathways for the upwards migration of fluids during compression, whereas background fracturing registered the presence of formation fluids that highly interacted with their adjacent host rocks. The paleohydrological system in the B\u00f3ixols-Sant Corneli anticline was restricted above the thick Upper Triassic evaporitic detachment level and thus comparable to other detached fold and thrust belts as the Central Appalachians and Sierra Madre Oriental as good examples.\n\n\n\n\n","18":"","19":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Phanerozoic tectonic history of the Chukchi shelf records a complex, multiphase history of deformation in Arctic Alaska. We document here the importance of structural inheritance in understanding this rich history. Located northwest of the Alaska North Slope, the U. S. Chukchi shelf comprises almost 200,000\u00a0km2 with present-day bathymetry less than \u223c60\u00a0m. The area of interest is limited to the region north of the Herald Arch thrust system, east of the U. S. \u2013 Russia maritime boundary, south of the North Chukchi Basin, and west of the Alaska coastline (Fig. 1\n).\nPrevious work in the Chukchi shelf (Sherwood et al., 1998, 2002; Kumar et al., 2011; Homza and Bergman, 2019) link the stratigraphy of the Chukchi shelf to that of the better-studied North Slope, where four tectonostratigraphic megasequences are recognized (Lerand, 1973; Hubbard et al., 1987; Bird, 2001, Fig. 2\n). The Devonian and older Franklinian megasequence constitutes a transition from passive margin to foreland-basin sedimentation, culminating with significant fold-and-thrust belt development (Sherwood, 1994). The Mississippian-Triassic Ellesmerian megasequence documents a transition from continental rifting to form the Hannah Trough to passive margin and sag-basin development (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). The Beaufortian megasequence represents a fundamental shift in tectonics in the area during Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting and formation of the North Chukchi and Canada Basins (Hubbard et al., 1987; Houseknecht and Bird, 2004; Hutchinson et al., 2017; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019a). The Brookian megasequence represents a change in provenance and foreland basin deposition from Early Cretaceous (Barremian-Aptian) on in response to Chukotka and Brooks Range orogenesis (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019b; Lease et al., 2022). It is the tectonism associated with these megasequences, as well as superimposed Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic contraction and extension local to the Chukchi region, that drove the ubiquitous structural inheritance present in the Hanna Trough.\n\n\n2\nStructural inheritance\nIt is well known that older deformation can influence subsequent deformation. Implicit in this concept of structural inheritance is that events are temporally distinct with a period of inactivity separating episodes of deformation (Holdsworth et al., 1997). Perhaps the most straightforward type of inheritance is classic fault reactivation in which later fault movement is localized on older faults as a result of decreased material strength (Byerlee, 1978; Handy, 1989) and fluid reactions in the fault zone (Wintsch et al., 1995). This can occur at the individual fault scale through the crustal scale, such as along the Alpine fault in New Zealand, where multiple ages of deformation in the same zone have been documented (White and Green, 1986). Commonly, interactions with pre-existing fabrics act to nucleate later deformation in a more distributed fashion, such as the influence of late Paleozoic basement fabrics on Cenozoic rifts in the Upper Rhine Graben in Germany (Schumacher, 2002).\nStructural inversion (Glennie and Boegner, 1981; Bally, 1984; Cooper and Williams, 1989; Buchanan and Buchanan, 1995) constitutes a particular type of structural inheritance whereby the sense of motion on faults, generally dip-slip, changes over time. While a period of tectonic quiescence is not mandatory, a change in far-field stress is required. The archetype example of inversion on discrete structures occurs as reverse faulting along earlier normal faults. This reactivation forms distinctive asymmetric fault-related folds with long back limbs and short front limbs (Williams et al., 1989). In the extreme, these inverted structures can be so asymmetric that the front limbs are thought of as distinct structures separate from the basement uplift, such as the monoclines in the Colorado Plateau, even though they are clearly tied to the overall, larger contractional uplift (Bump, 2003). Structural inversion is not simply conceptualized within the context of individual structures but also on a regional scale (Tari et al., 2020), for example, the full basin inversion of the Uinta Mountains during the Laramide orogeny (Hansen, 1986). Likewise, it is well known that the many older rift basins form the loci of later orogenic belts, such as in the Pyrenees (Mu\u00f1oz, 1992; Teixell et al., 2018). In these cases, attenuated continental crust serves to focus later contraction (Jackson, 1980). Whether at the local or regional scale, the later uplift in strata above a regional datum was termed positive inversion by Glennie and Boegner (1981).\nIn contrast, negative inversion (Glennie and Boegner, 1981) is the result of early contraction followed by later extension, resulting in subsidence below a regional datum. This is less commonly documented in the literature for discrete structures, perhaps because older thrust faults generally are not at a favorable orientation to resolve significant shear stress during later extension. Imbrication associated with thrust belts however can cause faults to steepen and thus be in more favorable orientations for later changes in the far-field stress (Tari et al., 2021). At the largest scale the concept of negative inversion encompasses extensional orogenic collapse (Dewey, 1988) due to crustal thickening that causes the lower crust to weaken and act as a region of later crustal extension. In some mountain belts detachment horizons in extension likely reactivate older contractional detachments. This is well documented in mountain belts such as the Cenozoic Cordillera of North America (Bally et al., 1966; Constenius, 1996). Repeated inheritance with different structural styles has been recognized in certain mountain belts, such as the control that the extensional Mesozoic Montmell fault in the Catalan Coastal Range, Spain had on Paleogene contractional and Neogene extensional fault systems (Mar\u00edn et al., 2021). Similarly, basement structures have been shown to be reactivated multiple times, such as in offshore Norway (Phillips et al., 2016).\nThere are several ways to identify structural inheritance in seismic reflection data. 1) As discussed above, multiple periods of motion on faults, whether inverted or simply reactivated, are a clear indication of structural inheritance. Coupled with growth strata and multiple unconformities, these are unambiguous indicators of multiple events or styles. A particularly compelling example is the concept of a null point in positive inversion structures, below which there is a normal sense of throw, and above a reverse sense (Williams et al., 1989). 2) Map-view deformational patterns of different ages that have parallel trends are suggestive of reactivation. Holdsworth et al. (1997) termed these \u201cgeometric similarity\u201d inheritance, and point out that when such parallelism of orientation is solely used they may not be reliable indicators of reactivation. Nonetheless, this criterion is useful when orientations with clear spatial overlap are used in conjunction with documented local reactivation of structures to extrapolate to a regional extent of reactivation. 3) Less obvious, but useful for recognition of inversion, are distinctive fault and fold geometries in cross section that differ from expected style. These shapes include the asymmetric positive inversion folds, but also, low-angle, steepening-bend normal faults that occur with negative inversion structures. The utility of these geometries is elaborated on later. Again, these are indirect indicators, and some independent temporal constraint is needed, such as growth strata or unconformities, to document multiple events regionally.\nWe show that every type of structural inheritance outlined above has occurred in the Chukchi Sea area over its complex Phanerozoic tectonic history. We use several seismic-reflection profiles to demonstrate that the tectonic evolution and present tectonic features of the area are better understood within the context of structural inheritance, both at the scale of individual structures and at the broader, basin scale. This framework is relevant to petroleum exploration in this underexplored area, as well the tectonics of the Arctic in general.\n\n\n3\nDatabase and methods\nThis report summarizes selected results from a regional seismic interpretation and mapping study of the subsurface of Arctic Alaska conducted over several years. Approximately 100,000 line-km of reprocessed 2D, time-migrated, seismic reflection lines constitute the primary data available for the Chukchi shelf. Well control is from six exploration wells (Fig. 1), with the deepest penetrated strata the Carboniferous Lisburne Group of the Ellesmerian megasequence (Fig. 2) in the Popcorn, Crackerjack, and Diamond wells (Sherwood et al., 2002). Thus, regional ties to deeper strata have relied on a broader, integrated, regional study of subsurface data that includes the North Slope and Beaufort Sea shelf. In the Arctic Alaska region, data availability includes several 100,000 line-km 2D, and 19 regional 3D seismic datasets, along with hundreds of exploration wells, including nearly 100 penetrations of the pre-Mississippian Franklinian megasequence (Fig. 3\n). These provide indirect constraints on pre-Mississippian strata in the Chukchi region.\nRegional interpretation was conducted using standard seismic interpretation methods with particular emphasis on regional unconformities. Our nomenclature for these is similar to that of Homza and Bergman (2019), with slight modifications and simplifications. The pre-Mississippian unconformity (PMU), marking the top of the Franklinian megasequence delineates inferred pre-Mississippian strata and potentially igneous and metamorphic rocks from younger strata. This surface may contain uppermost Devonian strata above it, but for simplicity we chose to refer to this as the PMU, with analogy to the well penetrations on the North Slope and Beaufort shelf (Fig. 3), where no known pre-Mississippian strata sit above this regional unconformity. The Permian unconformity (PU) defines the top of the lower Ellesmerian megasequence, and the Jurassic unconformity (JU) marks approximately the top of the upper Ellesmerian megasequence but also comprises part of the lower Beaufortian. The Lower Cretaceous unconformity (LCU) is established nearly at the top of the Beaufortian megasequence. The Cretaceous-Paleogene unconformity (KPU) separates Cretaceous and Tertiary strata (Fig. 2). In places, erosion has resulted in composite unconformities, which cut through multiple megasequences. For example, the PMU shown in Fig. 3 represents the top of the Franklinian megasequence, even though on parts of the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms, Brookian strata rest directly on Franklinian and thus that surface also represents the LCU and all older unconformities at these locations. Key mapping surfaces tied to wells, where penetrated, and correlated in seismic data throughout the Chukchi shelf include these five regional unconformities shown in Fig. 2, the approximate top of the Endicott Group in the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence, and the base and top of an acoustically distinct succession in the lower part of Franklinian megasequence. Details of diagnostic criteria for these horizons are discussed below.\nIn addition to interpreting offset reflectors, faults were recognized using the principles of fault-related folding (Suppe et al., 1992; Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Shaw et al., 1997, 2005). These principles recognize fault-cutoff geometries and defined dip domains (regions of homogenous dip) to delineate fold geometries. From these the underlying fault geometries can be inferred that are compatible with fault-related folding equations, and thus structural balancing concepts. Parts of some complex, inherited structures were modeled with the program fbfFor (Connors et al., 2021), which follows the principles of fault-bend folding to produce balanced, kinematic, sequential forward models. The concepts of structural inheritance outlined above, namely the sense of fault offset on multiple horizons, analysis of growth strata and unconformities, regional map patterns, and diagnostic structural styles, were used to infer multiple deformation episodes.\nWith the exception of Fig. 4\n, seismic images are shown with approximately no vertical exaggeration for the deeper reflective section, which is the main focus of this report. The average seismic velocity in the Chukchi shelf for the deeper section is approximately 4400\u00a0m\/s TWTT, based on Grantz et al. (1994) and proprietary industry data. Images displayed with a time axis shown with this average velocity will in general approximate a 1:1 section for the deeper section. Such displays have internal deviations from this, and will likely be modestly vertically exaggerated in the shallower section (up to \u223c1.5:1), but result in time sections that are as close as possible to undistorted. This allows for a more accurate representation of the true structural geometries depicted in these data, in order to understand the complex deformation present. Lateral velocity variations are generally gradual in the Chukchi shelf. One exception is a minor salt diapir west of the Popcorn well, where pullup is present in the time-migrated section as displayed in Fig. 4 at offset 90\u00a0km.\n\n\n4\nNeoproterozoic-early Paleozoic passive margin development, and Devonian folding and thrusting\nA seismic transect across the central Chukchi shelf (Fig. 4) shows that shallower reflectors are mainly continuous across the shelf, whereas deeper reflectors truncate against a less reflective section in angular discordance. In the Chukchi Platform and central Hanna Trough, a prominent, deep reflector separates a weakly reflective to seismically quiescent section from an overlying clearly reflective section. We interpret this as the PMU at the top of the Franklinian megasequence, based on seismic similarity and many well ties to that unconformity beneath the North Slope and Beaufort shelf (e.g., Houseknecht and Connors, 2016). Major structural features of the region are shown in a time surface of the PMU in Fig. 3. These features include the Hanna Trough, a substantial structural low bounded by adjacent highs, the Chukchi Platform to the west, the Arctic Platform to the east, and the North Chukchi high to the north. The present-day depression of the PMU within Hanna Trough grades to the south into the Colville foredeep, a structural low associated with the Cretaceous-Paleogene Brookian orogeny (Houseknecht, 2022). Homza and Bergman (2019) defined the Hanna Trough with respect to the limit of the syn-rift Carboniferous Endicott Group. This corresponds to the structural highs listed above, and extends to the south to a latitude of approximately Point Lay (Fig. 3; Homza and Bergman (2019) their Fig. 10).\nWhile the PMU is the deepest surface that can be unambiguously mapped regionally, deeper reflectors are observed locally, and these inform interpretations of the early tectonic history recorded in the Chukchi shelf. The deepest strata that can be correlated beyond individual seismic lines form a nearly isopachous succession defined by two moderate-to high-amplitude reflectors at the top and base in an otherwise transparent to low-amplitude succession on the east side of the transect shown in Fig. 4 (east of offset 220\u00a0km). No well penetrations of this succession are known and Grantz et al. (1982) interpreted it as sedimentary or metasedimentary strata based on lateral reflector continuity and postulated it to be early Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic in age (their \u201cPzpCs Unit\u201d). Craig et al. (1985) inferred this section to be carbonate based on seismic velocities and Embry (1990) suggested it to be correlative with Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic strata, dominantly carbonate shelf facies, of the Franklinian Basin in the Canadian Arctic Islands (Fox, 1985; Harrison and Bally, 1998; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Dewing et al., 2019). Sherwood (1994) invoked a similar correlation based on seismic similarity (his \u201cCarbonate Unit\u201d), as did Homza and Bergman (2019; their \u201cUndeformed Carbonate Unit\u201d). Kumar et al. (2011) referred to distinct reflectors in this section as \u201cIntra-Franklinian reflectors D, E and F.\u201d Because neither the age nor lithology is definitively known, we refer to this succession as simply the F1 section, indicating its lower stratigraphic position in the Franklinian megasequence (Fig. 4). Although apparent stratigraphic reflectors locally are evident below F1 (Fig. 5\n), we observe no definitive stratal patterns and make no attempt to interpret the age or origin those older rocks.\n\nGrantz et al. (1994) noted that the distinctive F1 section appears to continue into the western Beaufort shelf, east of Point Barrow (Nuvuk). Our correlations are consistent with this and suggest the succession is truncated by Mesozoic rift structures in the Beaufort shelf and may be present farther north and west as attenuated and dismembered blocks. The F1 section can be correlated throughout the Arctic Platform of the Chukchi shelf, the Northeast Chukchi Basin of Grantz et al. (1994), and west into the center of the Hanna Trough. Notably, we do not recognize it in the Chukchi Platform west of the Hanna Trough (Fig. 4) where reflectivity is poor.\nWe concur with previous authors that this several-km thick F1 section may be correlative with Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic strata in the Canadian Arctic Islands and further suggest it may be equivalent to the Neoproterozoic Katakturuk Dolomite and lower Paleozoic Nanook Group platformal succession exposed in the Sadlerochit and Shublik Mountains (Macdonald et al., 2009; Strauss et al., 2013, 2019). Thus, we suggest the F1 section may plausibly represent a Neoproterozoic through Ordovician, or possibly even Lower Devonian, passive margin succession in the Franklinian megasequence in the Chukchi shelf.\nOverlying F1 is a well stratified section that displays discontinuous reflector packages of consistent dip, separated by sharp breaks in dip across interfaces, some of which are flat and others that are dipping (Fig. 5). These dip domains, which commonly display irregular geometry (Fig. 5d), generally flatten to approach the dip of the underlying F1 at depth and are truncated by the PMU (Fig. 5c). Complicating interpretation of this interval are shallowly dipping, conflicting seismic events cutting across other events, such as at offset 87\u2013100\u00a0km in Fig. 5a. Because these mimic shallower reflectors, we interpret these as multiple reflections from shallower interfaces.\nThis section has not been penetrated by wells on the Chukchi shelf, and because of the discontinuous character cannot be clearly tied to penetrations in the North Slope or Beaufort shelf. This section has been interpreted as siliciclastic strata (Craig et al., 1985; Sherwood, 1994) that may be Early to Middle Devonian in age, based on similarity to the Ellesmerian foreland basin clastic wedge in the Canadian Arctic Islands (Miall, 1976; Embry, 1991; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Beranek et al., 2010). Alternatively, the section, particularly the lower part, may be Silurian flysch analogous to that found in the northern Canadian Arctic Islands (Trettin, 1998; Hadlari et al., 2014; Dewing et al., 2019) because the docking of Pearya in the Canadian Arctic Islands is thought be Late Ordovician to early Silurian (Trettin, 1998; McClelland et al., 2012). The F2 section may also be composed of foreland-basin deposits associated with the Arctic Caledonian orogeny which may have continued into the Early Devonian in the Chukchi borderland (O'Brien et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2017). The closest wells to the Chukchi study area that penetrate pre-Mississippian strata are those on the North Slope near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), where Upper Ordovician to Silurian rocks have been penetrated (Carter and Laufeld, 1975; Dumoulin, 2001; Houseknecht and Connors, 2016). Thus, we conclude that this reflective section in the Chukchi shelf is Late Ordovician-Devonian in age and denote it as the upper Franklinian F2 section.\nOur interpretation of the F2 section is that it experienced significant contractional deformation, consistent with the interpretations of Sherwood (1994) and Homza and Bergman (2019). Because of the intense deformation, the large spacing of the 2-D seismic grid available, and the lack of distinctive reflectors in this section, we did not attempt to correlate across all thrust sheets, but instead used fault-related folding principles (Shaw et al., 2005) to constrain structural style and fault and fold geometries locally. Specifically, we interpret the predominately west-dipping domains that are truncated locally as west-dipping thrust sheets cutoff against adjacent thrusts (Fig. 5). These geometries are consistent with contractional, imbricate fault-bend folding (Shaw et al., 2005) indicative of a dominantly eastward vergence and tectonic transport direction. Houseknecht and Connors (2016) recognized similar geometries in reflectors they interpreted to be Franklinian in the Beaufort shelf. We interpret the deformation to be detached at the base of the imbricated Upper Ordovician-Devonian strata because of the absence of these dip panels in the inferred Neoproterozoic-lower Paleozoic passive margin succession (F1, Fig. 5). In places, some intermediate detachment horizons likely are present in F2, with associated front limbs preserved, but several of the thrusts appear to have ramped to a paleosurface, or were later eroded (Fig. 5a and b). The clear angular truncations with the overlying reflectors suggest erosion of the thrust sheets, and the formation of local angular unconformities at the PMU. The irregular nature of this surface may be a relict topography recorded on the top of the fold-and-thrust belt (Fig. 5c).\nNo contractional growth strata are observed in the F2 interval. If an Early Devonian depositional age is correct for F2 and because the pre-Mississippian unconformity separates the Ellesmerian megasequence from the Franklinian megasequence below, then folding and thrusting are plausibly Middle to Late Devonian. As with the F1 succession, the fold-and-thrust belt is predominantly recognizable in the Arctic Platform, and can be mapped as far west as the center of the Hanna trough, but not west into the Chukchi Platform (Fig. 6\na). The poor reflector character to the Franklinian megasequence in the Chukchi Platform suggests highly deformed, steeply dipping beds, and potentially an igneous or metamorphic component to the rocks. Subsequent rifting, discussed below, commenced in the Early Mississippian, substantially modifying and obscuring the older fold-and-thrust belt geometry.\n\n\n5\nMississippian negative inversion\nSeismic events above the PMU are highly reflective, and locally, in the deepest positions, display dips that fan to steeper dips at greater time (e.g., Fig. 4, in the center of the Hanna Trough). These generally abut moderately dipping interfaces, and locally in their upper extents are angularly truncated against flat-lying to gently dipping reflectors (e.g., Fig. 5d, offset 65\u00a0km). We interpret these intervals as expanded lower part of the Ellesmerian growth strata (Endicott Group) in half grabens above mostly west-dipping normal faults in the center and eastern parts of the trough (Fig. 4). These structures define the dominant structural feature in the Hanna Trough, a north-south, failed rift system. Crustal extension is proposed to have commenced in the Late Devonian (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). Because this section has not been penetrated in the Chukchi shelf, the age of the onset of rifting is poorly constrained, but likely was occurring by the Early Mississippian, potentially extending into the Pennsylvanian.\nLying above the growth strata, flat-lying to gently dipping, continuous reflectors are present, tied to well penetrations in the Ellesmerian Lisburne Group (Sherwood et al., 2002). This section locally truncates against steeply dipping reflectors at high angles (e.g., Fig. 5c, offset 65\u201367\u00a0km). We interpret these as upper Carboniferous Lisburne strata pinching out against bathymetric scarps, thereby forming buttress unconformities. These likely mark the cessation of rifting and onset of a sag-basin phase (Homza and Bergman, 2019). There may have been continued minor extension during deposition of Lisburne Group strata because the geometry of strata in this section against scarps is not entirely flat-lying in places, such as can be seen on the east of the Hanna Trough (e.g., Fig. 5d, offset 100\u2013103\u00a0km).\nFanning, antithetic dip (rollover) in half grabens is commonly observed and associated with syntectonic (growth) strata related to displacement on flattening normal faults (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Shaw et al., 1997; and many others). Other evidence for the flattening of many of these faults into a mid-crustal detachment zone is indicated by the structural relief across half grabens where the syn-rift lower Ellesmerian section shows little structural relief across hinges. That is, this relationship suggests that only heave could be accommodated at these positions away from the steeper fault segments, based on area balancing constraints. We interpret the northern part of the Hanna Trough to comprise multiple, flattening normal faults that dip both east and west, based on the constraints outlined above. The main rift geometry and timing interpreted here are broadly consistent with previous interpretations by Sherwood et al. (2002), Kumar et al. (2011), and Homza and Bergman (2019). The greatest throw on these crustal normal faults is more than 4\u00a0s TWTT on several west-dipping faults (Fig. 4, offset 160\u00a0km). Based on typical seismic velocities in the area, we estimate that more than 8\u00a0km of syn-rift and post-rift Carboniferous section is preserved in these half grabens. Crustal normal faults are present in the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms, but because of later uplift and erosion do not preserve syn-rift strata (Fig. 6b).\nThe Hanna Trough demonstrates clear reactivation and inversion as indicated by growth strata, local unconformities, and distinctive fault-related folding geometries. In this section we focus on the first of these events related to Carboniferous rifting. In subsequent sections we discuss the later events, and the role of structural inheritance in their development. The Carboniferous rift-related faults generally offset the entire Franklinian section, and typically cut below the Devonian contractional detachment level (Fig. 5). The presence of pre-F1 high-angle faults, evidenced by expanded reflectors below F1 in Fig. 5a and b at offset 85\u201390\u00a0km, may explain why some Carboniferous faults cut the entire basement section. We suggest this evidence represents growth associated with a pre-F1 rift-related fault that provided a zone of weakness reactivated during Carboniferous rifting.\nNonetheless, at shallow levels the Carboniferous normal faults generally appear to localize on or near older thrusts in the F2 section. The reason for this shallow reactivation is likely because these thrusts are commonly imbricated and are steeper than primary thrust faults. Thus, they would have been in a more favorable orientation to slip in negative inversion when the stress field changed to one where crustal extension dominated; that is, where the maximum compressive stress was close to vertical. The fact that these normal faults also generally cut the older F2 contractional detachment horizon suggests that this surface was not as weak as the heterogenous (and commonly previously faulted) mid-crust during Carboniferous rifting.\nThe structures in Fig. 5a and b shows examples of this relationship of shallow negative inversion of Devonian thrusts, with offset of the detachment horizon and shallowly dipping F1 at depth. A compelling example is the complex structure imaged in the highlighted box on Fig. 5b. The seismic energy here is strong, with clear reflectors and few conflicting or cross-cutting reflectors. Thus, we believe the section has been migrated well, and is indicative of true, complex structural geometry. These same relationships are present along strike in other seismic lines, providing further confidence in the relationships inferred on this structure. The geometry is one in which the hanging wall shows steep, west-dipping reflectors of the F2 section in angular truncation with a shallow, predominantly east-dipping lower part of the Ellesmerian section. Furthermore, there is a relict topography on the PMU unconformity. The F2 section dips west in the hanging wall, close to the dip of the Carboniferous normal fault. In the footwall, the F1 is nearly horizontal. A possible explanation of this odd geometry is shown in the sequential, balanced, forward, kinematic model of Fig. 7\n. The seismic section is not depth-migrated, and thus the model is not meant to exactly replicate the seismic section. Nonetheless, the model satisfactorily explains the observed seismic geometry in the Carboniferous and older section. The model steps shown in Fig. 7a and b illustrate a break-forward, imbricate Devonian fold-and-thrust belt with steep westward dip and subsequent angular truncation by the PMU. Fig. 7c is a model step showing how Carboniferous extension reactivated one of the thrust planes in negative inversion but did not follow the thrust plane down to a detachment, but rather flattened slightly at the older flat-ramp transition and offset the detachment and F1 section at depth. Sedimentation occurred in the accommodation created by the extension (Fig. 7c and d) with gentle antithetic dip into the fault. Had the normal fault flattened to the contractional detachment and formed a large concave bend, and assuming the lower part of the Ellesmerian section was syn-rifting, there should have been significant antithetic rollover into the fault based on extensional fault-bend folding theory (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Connors et al., 2021). This reactivated fault coalesces with another rift-related fault just to west (Fig. 5b) and gently flattens into the center of the Hanna Trough. As discussed above, in other places in the Hanna Trough more pronounced antithetic rollover is observed for many of the large half grabens related to a mid-crustal detachment (Fig. 4).\nAnother unusual structural geometry related to Carboniferous negative inversion is shown in the highlighted box in Fig. 5d. At this locality near the center of the Hanna Trough, Endicott Group strata are generally deeper than 5\u00a0s TWTT (offset 7\u201327\u00a0km) and display bidirectional dip and thicken into a syncline. On the east flank of the syncline, the lower part of the Ellesmerian strata thin and pinch out by onlap onto an inferred, west-dipping Carboniferous normal fault. Although east-dipping strata on the west flank of the syncline are consistent with antithetic rollover on a flattening normal fault, west-dipping strata on the east flank suggest synthetic rollover relative to the normal fault. These observations are consistent with extensional fault-bend folding theory of a convex, extensional fault-bed (Xiao and Suppe, 1992; Connors et al., 2021). Fig. 8\n demonstrates a sequential, balanced, forward, kinematic model that explains this observed Carboniferous and older geometry. The model is not an exact attempt at matching the observed structure, and the absence of post-Carboniferous differential subsidence modeling across the section somewhat obscures the geometry. Nonetheless, we feel it does explain many of the features observed in the seismic record. Fig. 8a thru 8d model a break-forward imbricate Devonian fold-and-thrust belt that developed first, with potentially significant topography. Fig. 8e and f model a thrust that was reactivated in negative inversion during the Carboniferous, but along a fault with both steepening and flattening segments. The convex bend across the steepening segment was due to the previously folded, contractional, second imbricate fault, and the concave bend was due to the normal fault taking advantage of the older contractional detachment horizon. Thus, the normal fault closely mimicked the contractional geometry of the westernmost thrust, resulting in the strange locally thick Ellesmerian section and related synclinal geometry of extensional growth strata. This stands in contrast with the previous example (Fig. 7), in which the normal fault cut across the older detachment. Local reactivation of the older contractional detachment suggests that here, in the center of the Hanna Trough during Carboniferous rifting, the older thrust-fault detachment likely was weaker than the F1 strata in the footwall below the detachment. It is not known why that would be the case. We speculate it may be due to local facies changes, or fluid pressure along the detachment, or that the mid-crust in this locality lacks pre-F1 faults or weak zones. There is likely another reactivation in this complex structure, a component of Cenozoic extension, as discussed in a later section.\n\n\n6\nLate Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion\nAn interval of relative tectonic quiescence persisted from the Mississippian through the Triassic across Arctic Alaska during which the Hanna Trough evolved into a sag basin and the Chukchi and Arctic Platforms remained structural highs (Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019). The upper part of the Ellesmerian megasequence strata reflect this quiescence, with generally carbonate and fine-grained siliciclastic deposition, including a relatively high proportion of petroleum source rocks in the Hanna Trough sag basin (Sherwood et al., 2002). The Lower and Middle Jurassic strata of the Beaufortian megasequence, including the lower part of the Kingak Shale, were likely deposited during this pausing of tectonism.\nTectonic activity was renewed in the Late Jurassic, with the initiation of rifting and opening of the North Chukchi and Canada Basins to the north and northeast, respectively (Grantz et al., 2011; Shephard et al., 2013; Hutchinson et al., 2017). To the south and southeast, closure of the South Anuyi ocean basin culminated in the Chukotka orogen and closure of the Angayucham ocean basin culminated in the Brooks Range orogen, respectively, during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Shephard et al., 2013; Amato et al., 2015; Moore and Box, 2016). The Jurassic rifting events to the north impacted the Chukchi shelf by thermal bulging, rifting, and volcanism in parts of the Hanna Trough (Homza and Bergman, 2019). Strike-slip and contractional deformation of the North Chukchi high and \u201cGrantz transpression zone\u201d probably was under way during the Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) (Fig. 1; Homza and Bergman, 2019), although the age of initiation is not apparent. The closure of ocean basins to the south likely impacted at least the southern Chukchi shelf as fold-and-thrust belts associated with the Chukotka and Brooks Range orogens propagated northward, although the northern extent of Jurassic thrusting was located considerably south of the Wrangel-Herald Arch and current Brooks Range frontal fold-thrust belt shown in Fig. 1 (Moore and Box, 2016).\nBeaufortian strata in the Chukchi shelf were significantly influenced by Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) deformation. In the northern Chukchi shelf and adjacent North Slope, a series of southward off-lapping sequence sets was deposited in response to rift-shoulder uplift associated with opening of the Canada Basin, constructing a series of west-northwest-oriented shelf margins (Hubbard et al., 1987; Sherwood et al., 2002; Houseknecht and Bird, 2004; Houseknecht and Connors, 2015; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019a). However, across much of the Chukchi shelf, Beaufortian strata display eastward clinoform dip and north-oriented shelf margins; this has been interpreted as evidence for positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-phase normal faults (Houseknecht and Connors, 2015), as shown below.\nAlong the southern boundary between the Chukchi Platform and Hanna Trough, several north-trending, rift-phase normal faults display geometries that suggest they were inverted during Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Fig. 6b). For example, in the structure shown in Fig. 9\n\n (offset 87\u201390\u00a0km), growth strata of the lower part of the Ellesmerian thicken in the hanging wall, consistent with a normal sense of motion during Carboniferous faulting. Yet the top of the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence (PU) and the Jurassic unconformity (JU) are structurally higher on the hanging wall than on the footwall by about 0.5\u00a0s TWTT (close to 1\u00a0km), indicating subsequent reverse motion at depth on the fault. Moreover, the upper part of the Ellesmerian (PU to JU) conserves layer thickness, suggesting an intermediate time in which no motion on the fault occurred. Beaufortian strata expand across the front of the structure, and the Lower Cretaceous unconformity is structurally higher on the hanging wall than on the footwall, although the structural relief is less than on the Jurassic unconformity. These observations indicate accommodation was created during this time, with likely growth strata, and constrain the age of inversion to Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.\nThe details of the broader structure are less definitive; for example, a back limb to the structure is not clearly apparent locally. Thus, the structure does not fit the geometry of a classic positive inversion structure as defined by Williams et al. (1989). There are poor reflectors potentially associated with strata of the lower part of the Ellesmerian megasequence on the west side of the line in Fig. 9. Therefore, the structure could be characterized as a basement uplift with a frontal monocline, much like those in the Colorado Plateau (Bump, 2003). Because the upper part of the Ellesmerian section broadly conserves layer thickness in the east limb, and reactivated slip on the older fault is small, the fault-related folding kinematics of the front limb are ambiguous. The structural style in the front limb may involve low propagation-to-slip, trishear kinematics (Allmendinger, 1998), or it may be associated with contractional fault-bend-fold kinematics along a fault flattening to an upper detachment, with minor slip on the detachment dissipated into the center of the basin.\n\n\n7\nComplex Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contraction and positive inversion\nCretaceous and Paleogene tectonics in the Chukchi shelf region mainly involved development of the fold-and-thrust belts of the Wrangel-Herald Arch (frontal belt of Chukotka orogen) and western Brooks Range. These events included significant uplift and exhumation, which shed a huge volume of siliciclastic sediment into the foreland, as well as contractional deformation of the western Colville foreland basin in the southern Chukchi shelf and adjacent North Slope (Mull et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2002; Sherwood et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2015; Moore and Box, 2016; Craddock and Houseknecht, 2016; Craddock et al., 2018; Homza and Bergman, 2019; Houseknecht, 2019b; Lease et al., 2022, Fig. 1). However, the thin-skinned folding and thrusting in this foreland position are locally detached at or near the Lower Cretaceous unconformity and thus no structural inheritance or inversion is apparent.\nIn contrast, Cretaceous to possibly Paleogene contraction in the northern Chukchi shelf is expressed in a different structural style, including complex interactions with older structures. The North Chukchi high (Thurston and Theiss, 1987; Johnson, 1990; Sherwood et al., 2002; Homza and Bergman, 2019, Figs. 3 and 6c), a basement uplift with substantial structural relief between the base of the Hanna Trough on the south to the crest of the structural high (Fig. 10), is the most distinctive expression of this deformation. The Hanna Trough, shown in the south part of Fig. 10, displays regional unconformities that show a reflective character similar to seismic images previously shown, with approximately consistent megasequence thicknesses in this orientation. In the center of the line (offset 45\u201380\u00a0km) a strong series of reflectors cannot be correlated below \u223c1\u00a0s TWTT and deeper data show substantial conflicting energy. Based on regional ties and the reflective character in this image, including local swings in reflectivity, we interpret that these likely are seismic artifacts in an otherwise reflective-poor, seismically quiescent, Franklinian section. The north part of the line (offset 85\u2013100\u00a0km) shows improved reflective character that can be mapped beneath, as well as truncating against, the seismically quiescent section. We tentatively interpret a PMU extending northward, but more work is warranted to better constrain the age of the section below this prominent unconformity. The LCU and KPU can be tied regionally, constraining the age of the younger strata and deformation.\nWe interpret the structural relief (more than 10\u00a0km) across the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high to be the result of large, south-vergent, contractional fault-bend folds along north-dipping imbricate thrusts (Fig. 10). Parallel folding just south of the high (offset 20\u201335\u00a0km) suggests contractional deformation by flexural slip and southward tectonic transport is constrained by the major structural relief through imbrication that brought the top of the pre-Mississippian section close to the seafloor in places. Fold limbs comprising Upper Cretaceous strata in angular truncation by the KPU brackets the timing of latest contraction to Late Cretaceous-early Paleogene. The southward tectonic transport from causative deep thrusts that step up to a local detachment in the lower part of the Ellesmerian section in the center of the Hanna Trough significantly constrains the interpretation. No additional contractional structures that can be linked to this detachment have been observed to the south in the Hanna Trough and, therefore, slip must be transferred back to the north as structural wedges in a triangle zone. Just north of this triangle zone (offset 40\u201355\u00a0km), south-directed thrust imbrication bring Franklinian basement close to the seafloor, providing some of the observed structural relief across the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high. The wedge interpretation requires some late south-directed thrusting to cut the roof thrust, but there may have been a component of earlier thrusting on these faults and associated uplift.\nWe interpret the northern boundary of the North Chukchi high to be bounded by deep-seated, south-dipping thrust faults that ramped northward up to a Cretaceous paleo-seafloor, forming local fault-bend folds. This likely occurred in the absence of significant local sediment cover at the time of thrusting, as constrained by the lack of folded growth strata in the lower Brookian megasequence. We interpret shortening to have commenced in the Aptian, as constrained by folding of the LCU and overlying Lower Cretaceous strata, and truncation by the KPU (offset 85\u201390\u00a0km in Fig. 10). Such deformation would be approximately coeval with deposition of the \u201cKalubik wedge,\u201d a lower Brookian succession unique to the Chukchi shelf that shed southward from the North Chukchi high (Homza and Bergman, 2019). These observations imply that uplift across the southern boundary of the high also occurred at this time, but direct evidence of that timing apparently was obliterated by later thrusting, as discussed above.\nOverall structural relief across the North Chukchi high suggests thrusts root in a mid-crustal detachment, likely as a distributed shear zone with associated crustal thickening, given the inferred depth at the time of deformation. The depth of the inferred detachment is similar to that of the Carboniferous rift-related detachment just to the south (Fig. 11\n). We speculate that the rift-related detachment may have localized the later contractional detachment, although it is difficult to demonstrate the extent of structural inheritance because the contractional inversion is nearly orthogonal to the older normal faults. Sherwood et al. (2002) proposed that the southern boundary of the North Chukchi high was an inverted Carboniferous transform fault that offset the Hanna Trough rift segment from an inferred rift segment in the North Chukchi Basin to the west. If that is the case, then this would indeed constitute true structural inheritance, at a basin-scale.\n\nHomza and Bergman (2019) document this trend of Late Cretaceous to Paleogene contraction also near the Popcorn well (Fig. 6c) which they termed the Popcorn high. We concur with this interpretation and propose that this is a continuation of a \u223c300-km-long regional contractional belt (Fig. 6c), obscured by later Cenozoic deformation. Given the multiple phases of growth to the structures, and the proximity to older Carboniferous rifts, the Popcorn high is another form of structural inheritance whereby the older Carboniferous north-south striking, rift-related normal faults act as strike-slip faults in the Cretaceous to Paleogene. These tear faults bound the southward-transported contractional structures (Fig. 6c). In this scenario the Popcorn high is both a Carboniferous horst, and a later Cretaceous to Paleogene block of imbricate thrusts. The east-west orientation of the line in Fig. 11b thus captures the dip-slip component to Carboniferous extension, whereas the north-south Cretaceous to Paleogene shortening occurs as motion in and out of the plane of the section. Subsequent Cenozoic extension resulted in another structural reactivation, as discussed in the subsequent section.\nLate Cretaceous-early Paleogene structural inheritance in the Hanna Trough is also manifest just southeast of the main North Chukchi high (Fig. 11c). Timing of contraction is constrained by the folded LCU and Lower Cretaceous strata (offset 230\u00a0km), similar to the nearby North Chukchi high (Fig. 10). Superficially, the structure in Fig. 11c looks like a positive inversion structure (Williams et al., 1989) associated with reactivation of a Carboniferous normal fault, with a long back limb and short front limb, a normal sense of motion at depth, and positive relief in the shallow horizons. However, this and other similar structures in the area likely were reactivated in oblique positive inversion. These structures strike in a discontinuous approximately north-south direction (Fig. 6c). If some displacement associated with the North Chukchi high was sent southward along a mid-crustal detachment and encountered Carboniferous normal fault geometries that strike north-south, then highly oblique structures associated with lateral boundaries of this enigmatic Late Cretaceous-Paleogene contractional event are plausible.\n\n\n8\nCenozoic extensional reactivation of rift features\nCenozoic strata in the Chukchi shelf represent a continuation of Brookian megasequence sedimentation associated with northward routing of sediments derived from Chukotka and the western Brooks Range (Thurston and Theiss, 1987; Sherwood et al., 2002; Houseknecht and Bird, 2011; Homza and Bergman, 2019). Most of these previous authors invoke transtensional and transpressional deformation in the Chukchi shelf in the Cenozoic based on interpreted flower structures on vertically exaggerated seismic sections. While some strike-slip component is likely present, it is challenging to ascertain this from a regional 2D seismic grid. When seismic lines in the area are examined with approximately no vertical exaggeration, it is clear that extension is ubiquitous, with a significant inheritance from previous structures.\nInspection of seismic data from the northern Chukchi Platform shows clear reflectors in the top 3\u00a0s TWTT that can be followed across discrete high-angle boundaries, with reflector offset, and in places dip into the boundaries (Fig. 11). These reflector geometries and correlation of regional unconformities indicate fault reactivation during Cenozoic crustal extension along mainly east-dipping, normal faults that are high-angle near the surface and sole to a mid-crustal detachment (Fig. 11a). Ellesmerian growth strata in the eastern grabens indicate Early Mississippian extension. Paleocene to Pliocene structural reactivation is evident by offset of the KPU and post-Paleogene growth strata (Fig. 11a). Ellesmerian strata thin to the west, but the relationship of older faults being reactivated discretely in the Cenozoic holds. On the east side of the line (Fig. 11a, offset 80\u201385\u00a0km), salt deposition in the Carboniferous, with modest reactive diapirism in the Cenozoic (Thurston and Lothamer, 1991; Homza and Bergman, 2019), is consistent with these two phases of crustal extension.\nIn contrast, in the central Hanna Trough, despite the fact that discrete Carboniferous rift-related normal faults mainly dip west, Cenozoic faults dip in both directions, in a more distributed fashion, forming local half grabens (Fig. 11b). In many cases, the seismic imaging is insufficient to resolve the fault geometry at depth, which may suggest these Cenozoic faults sole in a complex fashion into a local detachment in the upper part of the Ellesmerian, or alternatively strain may be distributed below seismic resolution at this stratigraphic interval. The strikes of minor Cenozoic normal faults are difficult to determine because of the modest throw and regional seismic grid spacing. Nonetheless, if the sections are displayed with little vertical exaggeration one can infer a nominally true dip orientation of east and west because these Cenozoic faults are high-angle and thus approximate the primary fault geometry shown in Fig. 11b. Thus, this Cenozoic extension is mostly east-west, mimicking the earlier extension direction.\nSupporting this is the fact that there is an increased amount of Cenozoic extension above the older rifts, and thus these Cenozoic faults appear related to the older extensional fabric, as is interpreted on the fault in the center of the section in Fig. 11b (offset 165\u2013175\u00a0km). This suggests that a local response to renewed crustal rifting occurred in places. A similar localized Cenozoic extensional reactivation is observed above the Carboniferous negative inversion structure shown in Fig. 5d. Cenozoic normal faults also cut the Late Cretaceous inversion structures discussed in the previous section, but not necessarily at original, Carboniferous rifts. An example is observed in the Cenozoic faults on the crest and back limb of the inversion structure in Fig. 11c (offset 220\u2013225\u00a0km). The contrast between distributed Cenozoic extension in the Hanna Trough, and discrete Cenozoic extension in the Chukchi Platform may be due to local variations in mechanical strength in the lithosphere related to the amount of post-rift section in each area.\n\n\n9\nDiscussion\n\n9.1\nTectonic implications\nSeveral observations presented here are consistent with the Chukchi Platform being the hinterland, and the Arctic Platform the foreland, of a major middle Paleozoic convergent margin. These include: 1) the change in seismic character of the F2 (likely Upper Ordovician-Devonian) section across the Hanna Trough, 2) the fold vergence and tectonic transport to the east, and 3) the detached style in the Arctic Platform. Sherwood et al. (2002) proposed that the high magnetic signature in the Chukchi Platform may reflect volcanic arc rocks juxtaposed against sedimentary strata to the east in the Hanna Trough and Arctic Platform. Miller et al. (2017) proposed that the Chukchi Platform is the metamorphic core of the Arctic Caledonian orogen related to the suturing of Pearya onto Laurentia. This would be a southern extension of the Pearya-Laurentia terrane boundary in the Chukchi borderland proposed by O'Brien et al. (2016) based on dredge samples and consistent with earlier dredge and core samples from Grantz et al. (1998). Homza and Bergman (2019) likewise postulated a suture between Pearya and Laurentia along the Hanna Trough. On the eastern flank of the Hanna Trough and western margin of the Arctic Platform thick-skinned contraction involving much of the Franklinian megasequence has been proposed (Kumar et al., 2011). Miller et al. (2017) interpreted this to be the basement-involved thrust front of the Arctic Caledonian orogen. As discussed above, we interpret the F1 to not be involved in contraction, and instead have a detached fold-and-thrust belt lying above it. Thus, this contraction may be a thin-skinned foreland of the final vestiges of the Arctic Caledonian orogen, in the Late Silurian to Early Devonian. Similar aged contractional structures and uplift have been observed in the Canadian Arctic Islands related to the Boothia event (Harrison, 2018; Dewing et al., 2019). Alternatively, the deformation may be analogous with the Early to Middle Devonian Romanzof orogeny in northwestern Yukon and Arctic Alaska (Lane, 2007). The folding and thrusting could also potentially be Late Devonian to Early Mississippian, similar to the Ellesmerian orogeny of Arctic Canada (Trettin et al., 1991; Embry, 1991; Harrison and Brent, 2005; Beranek et al., 2010). In short, at this point timing of the fold-and-thrust belt involving the F2 strata is poorly constrained because timing of the section itself is not well known.\nAt a basin-scale, crustal normal faults that cut the pre-Mississippian unconformity (PMU) are present in much of the same area as the observed pre-Mississippian (likely Devonian) fold-and-thrust belt (compare Fig. 5a and b). These rifts also extend west beyond the main Hanna Trough and into the Chukchi Platform (Figs. 4 and 6b). The close correspondence in space and time of contraction followed by extension, as well as the fault-fold geometries discussed previously, suggest post-orogenic collapse (Dewey, 1988) in the hinterland of the older fold-and-thrust belt to form the Hanna Trough, consistent with the views of Homza and Bergman (2019).\nThe Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-related normal faults resulted in localized west-east shortening (Fig. 6b). The fact that they are localized in the southern Hanna Trough (Fig. 6b) suggests they may be a far-field effect of oblique contraction in the foreland of the Chukotkan orogeny (Houseknecht and Connors, 2015; Homza and Bergman, 2019).\nThe North Chukchi high represents a significant regional, if poorly understood, contractional feature in the Arctic. Formation of it overlaps temporally with contractional deformation in the Wrangel-Herald Arch and western Brooks Range but lies about 200\u00a0km north of the foreland structures (Fig. 1) and nearly 400\u00a0km north of the main orogens (Moore and Box, 2016). Homza and Bergman (2019) pointed out the connection to the east-northeast trending \u201cGrantz transpressional zone\u201d (Fig. 1), although the extent and kinematic role of a transverse component in forming the north- and south-vergent contractional structures remain unknown.\nThe greatest Cenozoic extension is in the northern Hanna Trough and diminishes to the south (Fig. 6c). Unmapped at this time is the complex Cenozoic extension at the margin of the North Chukchi Basin. Related extension may link to the Chukchi borderland (Fig. 1), where existing fault scarps are pronounced in bathymetry (Ilhan and Coakley, 2018). This extension at the margin of the North Chukchi Basin speculatively may be due more to far-field, plate-related mechanisms, perhaps related to opening of the Eurasia Basin and northward propagation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Cenozoic (Shephard et al., 2013).\n\n\n9.2\nPetroleum systems implications\nPetroleum systems elements of the Chukchi shelf are summarized below, based on Sherwood et al. (1998, 2002), Houseknecht et al. (2012), Villegas et al. (2017), Homza and Bergman (2019), and Houseknecht (2021, 2022). Known and potential oil-prone source rocks are concentrated in and near the Hanna Trough, particularly in Carboniferous to Lower Jurassic sag-basin deposits. Known source rocks are present in the Triassic Shublik Formation, distal facies of the Triassic Sadlerochit Group, and Jurassic Kingak Shale. Potential source rocks may occur in the Carboniferous Lisburne Group (Fig. 2). Source rocks also are known in Cretaceous foreland basin deposits of the informally named pebble shale unit (PSU) and gamma-ray zone (GRZ), although these tend to be of lower quality than coeval strata in the North Slope and Beaufort shelf. Source rocks are postulated to occur in Cenozoic strata in the northern Chukchi shelf, most likely in distal facies of Barremian to Turonian and Eocene strata. Known and potential reservoir rocks occur throughout the Phanerozoic stratigraphic section, mainly in sandstone but also in carbonate rocks of the Lisburne Group. Two- and three-dimensional seismic data reveal a spectrum of stratigraphic, structural, and combination trap geometries spanning the stratigraphic column and present across much of the Chukchi shelf. Seals are mainly shale throughout the region and evaporite seals may be present locally in grabens known to contain evaporites within the Ellesmerian megasequence, mainly in the northwestern Chukchi shelf.\nBurial history modeling suggests that oil generation from pre-Cretaceous source rocks occurred during the Early to Late Cretaceous and from Cretaceous and Cenozoic source rocks during the Late Cretaceous to Neogene. Within this temporal context, structural inheritance may have exerted both positive and negative influences on the occurrence and preservation of hydrocarbon accumulations. Early Cretaceous and older structural events likely had little influence on petroleum systems other than creating potential migration pathways and traps for hydrocarbons generated during subsequent burial. However, Late Cretaceous and younger structural events may have influenced petroleum systems elements significantly.\nLate Cretaceous to Paleogene contraction and positive inversion likely post-dated or temporally overlapped hydrocarbon generation in Lower Cretaceous and older source rocks. The most likely positive influence may have been the creation of potential migration pathways and structural and combination traps that may have formed during or shortly following hydrocarbon generation; natural gas trapped in the Burger anticline may be an example. Negative influences may have included uplift and exhumation of strata comprising potential carrier beds and reservoir rocks, resulting in migration to the ground surface or seafloor; the non-productive Popcorn anticline may be an example.\nCenozoic extensional reactivation of rift features likely post-dated or temporally overlapped hydrocarbon generation in Lower Cretaceous source rocks. Positive results may have included creation of diapiric traps (salt domes) and seals in evaporite-bearing grabens and formation of structural traps comprising rotated fault blocks and other transpressional closures; none of these trap types has been tested. Negative results may have included fracture-breaching of older traps and seals leading to remigration of previously trapped hydrocarbons to the ground surface or sea floor.\n\n\n\n10\nConclusion and future work\nWe have presented several seismic examples of structural inheritance in the Chukchi shelf, Alaska. These include: 1) Carboniferous negative inversion of a Devonian east-vergent fold-and-thrust belt widespread within the Hanna Trough and Arctic Platform, 2) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous positive inversion of Carboniferous rift-related normal faults, 3) Late Cretaceous-Paleogene positive inversion in the North Chukchi High, and 4) Cenozoic extension and strike-slip reactivation and negative inversion manifest in a variety of forms in the northern Chukchi shelf. The multiple episodes of reactivation show that structural inheritance can be passed down through multiple generations during the tectonic evolution of an area. The fact that such structures are spatially so close shows how important it is to consider inheritance in an interpretation.\nThe North Chukchi high, particularly its northern boundary, is not well constrained and merits further study. Determining the lateral extent of reactivation and more complete 3D geometry of the North Chukchi high polyphase deformation is a logical next step. Because of the extent of structural inheritance, and changing tectonic transport directions over time, 3D modeling and balancing or restoration based on interpretations from depth-migrated images may be required, and would lend additional confidence in, or modifications to, the interpretations presented here. Such work would require unraveling the Cenozoic extension and strike-slip faulting in the area, in and of itself poorly understood. Mapping out in more detail the nature of Cenozoic extension as it extends into the poorly known North Chukchi Basin and Chukchi borderland would likewise be useful, and has implications for circum-Arctic Cenozoic tectonics.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nConnors: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data Curation, Writing - Original Draft, Writing - Review & Editing, Visualization, Funding acquisition.

It is found in nature in marine settings, including continental margins and deep marine sediments, as well as in sub-glacial and permafrost environments (e.g., Ruppel, 2015; Portnov et al., 2016; Boswell et al., 2020). Submarine gas hydrate formation depends on factors such as the availability, composition and source of gas, pore-size distribution, pore-water salinity, geothermal gradient and seafloor temperature (Dickens and Quinby-Hunt, 1997; Kvenvolden and Lorenson, 2001; Moridis and Collett, 2003). The most abundant hydrate-forming gas in marine sediments is methane (CH4), commonly with small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other small molecule gases, due to the bacterial breakdown of organic matter within the shallow sediments (e.g., Kvenvolden, 1993; Sloan, 1998, 2003; Stern et al., 2011). The presence of heavier hydrocarbons (i.e., ethane, propane) is less common, and is associated with thermo-catalytic production at depth via heating of buried kerogen (e.g., Sloan, 2003; Lu et al., 2007; Bourry et al., 2009). Gas hydrate has the potential to be an important future energy resource, especially in countries that lack other indigenous fossil fuel resources (e.g., Kvenvolden, 1993; Grauls, 2001; Collett et al., 2009; Boswell and Collett, 2011; Arora et al., 2015; Boswell et al., 2020). Vast research programs have been undertaken by countries including the United States, Canada, Japan, India, South Korea, and China in order to explore the long-term goal of exploiting gas hydrates as energy resource in a cost effective and safe manner (e.g., Collett et al., 2014; Arora et al., 2015; Han et al., 2019).\nMultidisciplinary investigations using geophysical techniques (e.g., seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic surveys, well logging) as well as geochemical analyses have been extensively used to explore gas hydrate accumulations on continental margins and permafrost regions (e.g., Minshull et al., 2020). Scientific ocean drilling has provided log and core data to assess the characteristics of gas hydrate deposits, and to test methods for their exploration and production (e.g., Collett et al., 2014, 2019; Boswell et al., 2020). Seismic reflection data may be used to identify the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) beneath the seafloor, which manifests as a high amplitude seismic reflection with negative impedance contrast known as a Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) (Shipley et al., 1979; Brown et al., 1996; Andreassen et al., 1997). BSRs can arise at the boundary between a gas hydrate-bearing layer with high-velocity overlying sediments with a normal velocity (Hyndman and Davis, 1992; Hyndman and Spence, 1992), though they more commonly identify the boundary between sediments containing gas hydrate underlain by a low-velocity zone, typically a few meters to many tens of meters thick, in which there is a small proportion of free gas within the pore space (e.g., Miller et al., 1991; Singh et al., 1993; MacKay et al., 1994; Hovland et al., 1997). Note that the lack of a BSR in an area where stability conditions are present does not necessary imply the absence of gas hydrate (e.g., Chabert et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2011). Seismic evidence of gas accumulations and migration pathways within the GHSZ, such as gas chimneys and pipes, can also be considered as indirect indicators for the presence of gas hydrate (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992) as they show the potential availability of gas for hydrate formation.\nIn this study, we investigate the likely occurrence of natural gas hydrate deposits in the northern Bay of Bengal (BoB), within the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fig. 1\n). Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries and relies on natural gas for much of its energy needs (Masud et al., 2020). However, as domestic reserves are rapidly depleting, the country is now exploring the possibility of developing renewable energy resources and unconventional fossil fuels to sustain the continuous increase in its energy demand (Masud et al., 2020). West of Bangladesh, along the eastern Indian continental margin (Fig. 1), results from expeditions of the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) have proven the presence of conspicuous amounts of gas hydrate accumulations in the Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi Basins (e.g., Collett et al., 2008, 2014; Ramana et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2011; Lorenson and Collett, 2018; Shukla et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). To the east of Bangladesh, large gas fields (Shwe, Shwe phu, Mia; Fig. 1) associated with Pliocene turbidites have also been discovered in the offshore Myanmar in close proximity to Bangladesh shallow offshore exploration blocks (e.g., Yang and Kim, 2014; Zhan et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020). Within the Bangladesh EEZ, the Sangu and Kutubdia gas fields and other non-commercial hydrocarbon fields (Fig. 1), and the high amounts of methane and other higher molecular weight hydrocarbon gases detected in the water column and in the thick sedimentary infill, indicate the existence of both deep and shallow gas reservoirs (e.g., Curiale et al., 2002; Berner et al., 2003). The proximity and similarity to the tectono-stratigraphy of gas hydrate prospective areas offshore eastern India, and the evidence for hydrocarbon systems both offshore Myanmar and within the Bangladesh EEZ itself, are good indicators for the presence of gas hydrates within the Bangladesh EEZ. However, to our knowledge, no published studies have yet investigated the occurrence of natural gas hydrate in this area.\nIn this study, we present a first assessment of the presence and distribution of gas hydrates within the Bangladesh EEZ, using 2D multichannel seismic reflection data. The study is sponsored by the Government of Bangladesh and the data is obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Petrobangla and its subsidiary Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production company (BAPEX). Based on the data provided, we first describe the sedimentary successions of the Bangladesh continental shelf and slope areas, and present evidence for gas indicators, including a discontinuous BSR. We identify seismic interval velocities indicative of gas\/gas hydrate-bearing sediments and use them to provide a qualitative estimate for gas hydrate saturation of sediments. We then model the theoretical base of the methane gas hydrate stability zone and compare it to the observed depth of the BSR. Discrepancies between observations and model results are discussed in terms of possible controls on the gas hydrate system. Our findings provide insights on the gas hydrate potential of this frontier area and can help to guide the planning of future exploration and drilling programs offshore Bangladesh.\n\n\n2\nRegional geologic setting\nThe Bay of Bengal (BoB) represents the north-eastern extension of the Indian Ocean, bordered by India, Bangladesh and the Indo-Burman Ranges of Myanmar (Fig. 1), and contains a sedimentary depocenter comprised of up to 20\u00a0km of Oligocene to Recent sediments (Curray and Munasinghe, 1989; Curiale et al., 2002; Alam et al., 2003). Basin evolution started in early Cretaceous time with the rifting of the Indian Plate away from Antarctica (e.g., Coffin and Lawver, 1998; Curray, 2014). However, the basin did not become a major depocenter until late Eocene time, when the northward-drifting Indian Plate collided with the Eurasia Plate resulting in the initial uplift of the Himalayan and Indo-Burman Ranges (Curray et al., 1982; Lindsay et al., 1991). During Oligocene to late Miocene time, the basin began to fill with sediments derived from the rising Himalayas and transported basinward by large river systems (Curray et al., 2003). During late Miocene and Holocene time, a major phase of continental collision (\u201chard\u201d collision) caused the rapid uplift of the Himalayas and consequent subsidence of the basin to the south (Curray et al., 2003). Increasing amounts of erosional detritus derived from the Himalayas were transported mainly by the Ganges-Brahmaputra River system to the offshore area during this time, forming a prograding delta system and distributing sediments downslope and into the deep ocean via turbidity currents (Curray et al., 2003). Late Tertiary sediments of the BoB are therefore represented by fluvio-deltaic to shallow-marine and deep-marine turbidite deposits, overlain by southward prograding deltaic sequences (Curray and Moore, 1971). This delta system has advanced over time to form the world's largest submarine fan complex, the Bengal Fan, extending over the entire BoB from 20\u00b0N at 1400\u00a0m water depth to 7\u00b0S at 5000\u00a0m water depth over a N\u2013S length of 3000\u00a0km (Curray and Moore, 1971).\nThe Bangladesh EEZ extends seaward to water depths of 2250\u00a0m and comprises the upper part of the Bengal Fan (Fig. 1). Here, up to 20\u00a0km of mostly Tertiary siliciclastic sediments, including deep-to shallow-marine, deltaic and fluvial facies were deposited at high sedimentation rates and contain large amounts of terrestrially sourced organic carbon (e.g., Brune et al., 1992; Curray, 1994; Ramana et al., 2009). The rapid burial of organic-rich sediments favors microbial methane generation (e.g., Ramana et al., 2009), while the presence of multiple deep petroleum systems indicates likely deeper sources supplying thermogenic gas (Curiale et al., 2002). Together with generally low geothermal gradients in this region (25\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C\/km; e.g., Guha et al., 2010; Akbar, 2011) favoring the development of a thick GHSZ (Sloan and Koh, 2008), these factors make the offshore Bangladesh EEZ a promising location for the occurrence of natural gas hydrate.\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nSeismic data\nThis study is based on 2D multichannel seismic reflection profiles acquired during two surveys. Thirteen pre-stack time migrated seismic profiles belong to a College de France (CDF) and TOTAL survey acquired in 2007\u20132008 (Fig. 1). The profiles were acquired using a 10.5\u00a0km-long streamer with 804 channels towed at water depth of 8\u00a0m, and a 6180 in3 tuned air-gun array of 64 air-guns towed at a water depth of 8\u00a0m and a 50\u00a0m shooting interval. Four other post-stack time migrated seismic reflection profiles were acquired by Fugro Geoteam AS in 2010 (Fig. 1). This survey used a 12\u00a0km-long streamer with 960 channels towed at a water depth of 11\u00a0m, and a 6300 in3 single air-gun source towed at a water depth of 10\u00a0m and a 50\u00a0m shooting interval. For both surveys, the processing sequence included SEGY reformatting, navigation merging, amplitude correction, de-signature and zero-phasing, band-pass filtering, noise attenuation, trace editing, velocity analysis, de-multiple (Radon and 2D SRME), and Kirchhoff pre-stack (for CDF\/TOTAL profiles) and post-stack (for FUGRO profiles) time migration. CDF\/TOTAL and FUGRO data are characterized by a dominant frequency of \u223c35\u00a0Hz and \u223c25\u00a0Hz within few hundred meters below seafloor, respectively. Thus, the expected vertical resolution for each dataset is \u223c12\u00a0m and \u223c17\u00a0m within the top few hundred meters depth below seafloor, assuming sediment seismic velocity of 1700\u00a0m\/s.\nManually picked root-mean-squared (RMS) and interval stacking velocities are available at a 500\u00a0m interval along the Fugro profiles and at a 5\u00a0km interval along the CDF profiles, which we used to convert the seismic profiles into depth. Velocities show a vertical picking interval of \u223c100\u00a0ms, thus providing a coarse vertical resolution.\nThe seismic reflection profiles were used to identify variations in seismic facies indicative of key sedimentary features (i.e., mass transport deposits, channel complexes and hemipelagic deposits) along the Bangladesh continental shelf and slope areas. Furthermore, the presence of anomalous seismic amplitude reflections was used to define the presence of potential BSRs and other indirect (i.e., bright spots, gas chimneys) evidence for gas hydrate accumulations (Figs. 2\u20135\n\n\n\n). Interval stacking velocities were also used to investigate the presence of anomalous high- and low-velocity zones within the shallow sediments, which could be related to gas hydrate-bearing and gas-bearing zones, respectively (e.g., Lee, 2004; Chabert et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2014) (Fig. 5).\nVarious seismic attributes were used to examine the frequency and amplitude characteristics of gas-charged sediments (Fig. 4). A root-mean-square (RMS) seismic attribute, which calculates the square root of the sum of the squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window (e.g., Chen and Sidney, 1997), was used to enhance seismic amplitude anomalies related to gas and\/or gas hydrate accumulations along seismic profiles (Fig. 4B). Similar results are given by the Envelope seismic attribute, also known as \u201cInstantaneous amplitude\u201d or \u201cReflection strength\u201d, which calculates the instantaneous magnitude of the analytic signal independent of phase (e.g., Taner et al., 1979; Chen and Sidney, 1997) (Fig. 4C). Finally, a Coherency seismic attribute was calculated to illuminate faults and discontinuities and to identify chaotic textures associated with gas migration pathways, chaotic channel infill, etc. (Fig. 4D). This attribute, which is scaled from 0 to 1, estimates the chaotic signal pattern contained within seismic data measured as the lack of organization in the dip and azimuth estimation method (e.g., Marfurt et al., 1999). To ensure good results, seismic attributes were calculated using short window lengths defined by a number of samples equal to 9 and 33, and by a directional window radius of 1.5 by 1.5, for the respective attributes.\n\n\n3.2\nGas hydrate saturation estimate\nInterval velocities available from seismic data (P-wave velocities) were used to estimate the amount of gas hydrate in sediments using rock physics models linking seismic velocity to the internal rock structure (e.g., Chand et al., 2004; Westbrook et al., 2008). The Hydrate-Bearing Effective Sediment (HBES) model described by Mar\u00edn\u2010Moreno et al. (2017) was used to calculate the P-wave velocity based on a sediment composed by mineral grains and variable amounts of brine, gas, and gas hydrate in the pore space. The Mar\u00edn\u2010Moreno et al. (2017) model builds on the approach of Ecker et al. (1998), who considered two idealized models for gas hydrate formation in the pore space of sand uncemented (for pore floating hydrate) and cemented (for cemented hydrate) sand models (Dvorkin and Nur, 1996; Mavko et al., 2009). These models are used to calculate the frame properties of the dry rock and introduced into the Biot-Stoll model (Biot, 1596a, 1596b; Stoll and Bryan, 1970) to obtain the elastic properties of the gas hydrate bearing sediment.\n\n\n3.3\nModelling of the BGHSZ\nModelling of the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) below the seafloor is used to complement and guide seismic interpretation, as this provides the sub-seafloor depth for the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) which can be compared against the depth of the BSR. The GHSZ thickness is given by the distance between the seafloor and the intersection of the temperature profile with a gas hydrate phase boundary (Mar\u00edn-Moreno et al., 2016). Hence, assuming hydrostatic pore fluid pressure, this calculation depends upon parameters such as bathymetry, geothermal gradient, seafloor temperature, pore-water salinity, and molecular composition of the hydrate-forming gas (e.g., MacLeod, 1982; Sloan, 1998).\nWe compiled bathymetry, temperature, salinity, and geothermal gradient data from the literature and available databases to define the model parameters. We relied on published literature for values of geothermal gradient in the Bangladesh offshore area, which were calculated from corrected bottom-hole temperatures at abandoned exploration well locations (Ismail and Shamsuddin, 1991; Guha et al., 2010; Akbar, 2011) (Fig. 1). Seafloor temperatures were available from the NOAA database at 100\u00a0m water depth-intervals within our study area (https:\/\/www.nodc.noaa.gov\/OC5\/woa18f\/; Locarnini et al., 2019). We calculated average temperature values for each 100\u00a0m interval and linearly interpolated them to create a smooth profile of decreasing temperature with increasing water depth (Figure S1). Note that we assume that seafloor temperature changes are only dependent on water depth.\nOur models consider 100% methane hydrate (Moridis, 2003), 3.5% wt pore water salinity (Miles, 1995), seafloor temperatures between 5.3\u00a0\u00b0C and 2.7\u00a0\u00b0C (https:\/\/www.nodc.noaa.gov\/OC5\/woa18f\/; Locarnini et al., 2019) corresponding to the water depths where BSRs are identified (1300\u20131900 m bMSL) (Figure S1), and geothermal gradients estimated from offshore wells between 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (well locations in Fig. 1; Guha et al., 2010; Akbar, 2011). We used a range of seafloor temperatures and geothermal gradients to consider their uncertainty and impact on the calculated depth of the BGHSZ. The Dickens and Quinby-Hunt (1997) relationship was used to consider pore water salinity effects in Moridis (2003) freshwater methane hydrate stability curve. We assumed hydrostatic conditions and converted depth to pressure with a water density of 1030\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123.\nThe calculated BGHSZ and the observed BSR may differ if the seismic velocities used for time-depth conversion of the seismic data are inaccurate. Also, differences may occur if the observed BSR represents a gas hydrate system affected by heat-flows anomalies, and\/or variable hydrate-forming gas composition (e.g., Ruppel and Kessler, 2017). We do not have constraints on spatial variations in the temperature field, nor on the composition of the hydrate-forming gas, but we accounted for possible time-depth conversion related errors by calculating BSR depth error range for an interval velocity variation between - 100\u00a0m\/s and +200\u00a0m\/s. Such stacking velocities variation was considered reasonable within our depth of interest, which extends to approximately 500\u00a0m below seafloor (mbsf). Over this depth range, the maximum decrease of - 100\u00a0m\/s was set to prevent sediment velocities from becoming too close, or lower than, water velocity. A larger maximum velocity increase of +200\u00a0m\/s was set in order to not exceed the average maximum velocity expected for sediments within the top 500 mbsf (e.g., Cook and Sawyer, 2015).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nOur depth converted seismic reflection profiles across the Bangladesh continental shelf and slope (Fig. 1) provide evidence of the presence and distribution of gas indicators within a variety of tectono-sedimentary features. Here, we first analyze the structural and stratigraphic architectural elements of the Bengal fan deposits, and then present evidence for seismic amplitude and velocity anomalies, indicative for either potential gas-bearing sediments or for BSRs in the slope domain (Figs. 2\u20135).\n\n4.1\nSedimentary and tectonic features\nOn the continental shelf, seismic profiles show the presence of V or U-shaped profiles with an erosion surface at the bottom, filled by chaotic deposits (i.e., slumps and debrites) in their lower parts and by more well-layered high to low amplitude reflections (coarser-to finer-grained sediments, respectively) in their upper parts. Pelagic or hemipelagic drapes often characterize the topmost part of the channel\/canyon infills (Fig. 2A). All these features indicate the predominance, in the shelf area, of incised channels and canyons subsequently infilled. Such sediment dispersal fairways typically develop at an early sedimentary stage due to the strong erosional ability of sedimentary flows (Sprague et al., 2005). Sediments infilling these erosional channels are also typically characterized by an overall fining upward sequence (e.g., Deptuck and Sylvester, 2018; Ma et al., 2020). Chaotic reflection packages showing contorted geometries and erosive bases, with variable internal seismic amplitude and reflection continuity representing fine-grained sediment with coarser-grained sections in some areas are also identified (Fig. 2A and 2B). These are interpreted as mass transport deposits (MTDs) (e.g., Piper et al., 1997). Channels\/canyons and MTDs are embedded in low to high amplitude, parallel to sub-parallel sedimentary layers representing alternating clayey, silty and\/or sandy deposits (BODC-3 Completion Report, 1978); their seismo-stratigraphic character and depositional geometries are consistent with marine regression and transgression phases and their impact on shelf deposition and growth (H\u00fcbscher and Spie\u03b2, 2005). A few near-vertical faults are visible in the shelf domain, extending from near seafloor down to deeper stratigraphic and\/or basement levels. In some cases, the faults are linked or terminate next to amplitude anomalies representing gas-charged layers (Fig. 2E).\nDown the shelf break into the Bengal fan upper slope, seismic profiles reveal sediment transport and accumulation patterns related to the evolution of channelized sediment flows, which we interpret as turbidity currents. In this area, channel incision into underlying deposits is characterized by the presence, on either side of the incision, of parallel to convergent, laterally continuous reflections of low to medium amplitudes with overall wedge-shaped geometry (Fig. 2F, 2H, 2I, 3C, 4). These features are interpreted as channel-levee systems, which generally evolve from incised channels initially formed by erosion and deposition of turbidity currents leading to self-channelization and, thereafter, continuing levee building by over-spilling processes (e.g., Hiscott et al., 1997; Deptuck and Sylvester, 2018). Submarine fans may contain one main channel-levee complex or a series of channel-levee complexes that develop in succession through avulsions (e.g., Deptuck and Sylvester, 2018). In our study area, numerous cut-off loops can be observed within channel-levees (Fig. 2F). These suggest different ratios of vertical aggradation and lateral migration (Schwenk et al., 2005). Medium to high amplitude reflections dominate within the cut-and-fill deposits of the channel-levee systems, whereas well-layered, lower amplitudes often intercalated with medium-amplitude reflections, are present within the levees (Fig. 2F, 2H, 2I). Seismic evidence suggests channel cut-and-fill deposits including mostly coarser-grained sands and gravels, and levee deposits predominantly composed of finely laminated, finer-grained sediments with occasional thin sand-rich intervals, similarly to observations from other channel-levee areas (e.g., Hiscott et al., 1997; Deptuck and Sylvester, 2017; Shukla et al., 2019). At some locations, channel cut-and-fill units are characterized by a chaotic and high-amplitude seismic facies (Figs. 2F and 3C). These chaotic high amplitude reflectors (CHARS) are considered to represent aggraded and migrated channel axes as well as abandoned channel-fill deposits (Schwenk et al., 2005). In between channel-levee complexes, mostly parallel, sheet-like reflectors are characterized by the alternation of low\/medium and high amplitude seismic facie; the latter is interpreted as beds of fine-to medium-grained sand resulting in high amplitude reflection packages (HARPS) (Fig. 2F and 2K). These are interpreted to result from levee avulsion followed by un-channelized turbidity currents flowing in intra-channel lows (Hiscott et al., 1997; Pirmez et al., 1997; Lopez, 2001; Bastia et al., 2010). Slow but continuous hemipelagic sedimentation occurring in the basin, unless remobilized by unconfined turbidite flows, may also constitute part of the sheet-like reflectors characterized by parallel and continuous, low-amplitude internal seismic facies (i.e., clay\/mud) (e.g., Stanbrook and Bentley, 2022). Chaotic and low to medium reflectivity units are also visible on seismic data (Figs. 2G, 3A and 3B). These are interpreted as MTDs both embedded within sub-seafloor sediments, or as slump and sedimentary waves features at the seafloor in proximity to the steep continental slope. The latter directly affect seafloor topography, indicating recent events of slope failure and downslope sediment transfer, which may be driven by eustatic variations and\/or tectonism, but that may also be triggered by gas hydrate dissociation (e.g., Nixon and Grozic, 2007).\nSeismic evidence for fault and fracture systems are widely distributed in the slope area (Figs. 2H and 4), clearly revealed by coherency attributes (Fig. 4D). These systems primarily affect sedimentary units up to 1000\u20131200 mbsf depth, but some faults extend to greater depths (Figs. 3 and 4). Some of the shallow faults and fractures reach seafloor or near seafloor depths (Fig. 4D). Seismic signal blanking and\/or disturbance effects are visible along some faults and are interpreted as evidence for active fluid migration. At seafloor depths greater than 2250\u00a0m, at the edge of our study area, sub-circular depressions are visible at the seafloor, which are interpreted as seafloor pockmarks (Fig. 2K). These seafloor features are underlain by chimney structures, consistent with the escape of fluids to form depressions (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992).\n\n\n4.2\nGas indicators and BSRs\nWithin the shelf deposits, there is evidence for widely distributed seismic amplitude anomalies typically associated with localized free gas accumulations (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992; Liner and McGilvery, 2019) (Fig. 2C\u20132E). Seismic profiles show that some anomalies are localized in small pockets (bright spots), whereas others are more laterally continuous, high reflectivity layers that suggest gas accumulation at the transition between high-permeability, high-amplitude coarse-grained sediments, and low-permeability, low-amplitude finer-grained sediments (Fig. 2C\u20132E). Both types of amplitude anomaly commonly lie at or near the seafloor, and are associated with seismic signal blanking, chaotic facies, and\/or velocity pull-down effects beneath them (Fig. 2C\u20132E). Vertical or near-vertical zones with lower reflection strength than the surrounding sedimentary reflectors are interpreted as gas chimneys, and so pathways for the upward migration of fluids (Judd and Hovland, 1992) (Fig. 2D). Signal blanking and velocity pull-down effects along fault planes are interpreted as indication of fluids, likely including thermogenic gas, using the fault as a migration pathway from deeper reservoirs towards upper stratigraphic levels (Fig. 2E).\nWithin the deposits of the slope domain, high amplitude, negative polarity reflections (bright spots) indicate the presence of gas-bearing zones (Fig. 2H\u20132J). Their appearance is enhanced by seismic amplitude attributes (Fig. 4B and 4C). Some of these bright spots are underlain by signal blanking effects that may arise from signal attenuation by the gas charged layer and by chaotic facies (Figs. 2J and 4), which may be caused by disrupted sedimentary fabric due to gas migration through a fracture network (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992). Seismic observations indicate the presence of gas and gas migration pathways and provide indirect evidence for the potential presence of gas hydrate accumulations in this area.\nIn the slope region, within a water depth range of 1300\u20131900 m, seismic reflections of variable continuity that parallel the seafloor at sub-seafloor depths of several hundred meters are observed, showing high amplitudes with reversed polarity, and crosscutting the background stratigraphy (Figs. 3 and 5). Such reflections are interpreted as BSRs, likely representing the BGHSZ (e.g., Kvenvolden and Barnard, 1983; Hyndman and Spence, 1992).\nSeismic attributes enhance the amplitudes associated with the BSR (Fig. 4B and C). In some places, beneath the BSR, high amplitude layers are observed (Figs. 3 and 4). These layers show a strong negative polarity reflection followed by a strong positive polarity reflection, and they generally lie sub-parallel to the BSR or are dipping to terminate against it (Figs. 3, 4B and 4C, 5). Strong positive polarity reflections may arise at gas-water interfaces (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992; Portnov et al., 2021) and could, therefore, be associated with the base of an interval containing free gas trapped beneath the BGHSZ.\nMapping of the BSR shows it is predominantly located towards the E-SE of the Bangladesh EEZ, in water depths of 1300\u20131900 m and at depths below seafloor of 250\u2013440\u00a0m (Fig. 6\n). The BSR is often discontinuous and observed on seismic profiles over distances of up to 100\u00a0km (i.e., CDF Line 14), which in map view form several areas of varying size (Fig. 6). Fault and fracture systems affect BSR continuity at several locations where they crosscut and\/or terminate at the base of the BSR (Fig. 3A, 3C, 4). Where faults\/fractures terminate at the base of the BSR, they are sometimes associated with abrupt terminations of high amplitude reflections (Figs. 3 and 4). In places, bright spots are visible above the BSR, and are associated with gas accumulations that attenuate the seismic signal and generate blanking effects that obscure the subjacent stratigraphy (Figs. 2J, 3C and 4).\n\n\n4.3\nInterval velocities across BSRs\nStacking velocities provide average interval velocities for sediments down to 500 mbsf, which is near the maximum depth (440 mbsf) at which BSRs are observed. Sediments outside the interpreted BSR areas show average interval velocities between \u223c1600\u00a0m\/s and \u223c1870\u00a0m\/s over this depth range (Fig. 5). Sediments above BSR locations generally show higher interval velocities reaching values of \u223c1920\u20131940 m\/s (Fig. 5). Higher average interval velocities within the BSR areas are consistent with the presence of gas hydrate in shallow marine sediments (Singh et al., 1993; Helgerud et al., 1999; Riedel et al., 2014).\nInterval velocities from seismic data (observed velocities) can be compared with those calculated from rock physics models to estimate ranges of hydrate saturation within sediments, based on the best-fitting parameters. Using the Mar\u00edn\u2010Moreno et al. (2017) model and assuming a sand\/quartz-dominated sediment frame with a bulk modulus of 36\u00a0GPa and a shear modulus of 45\u00a0GPa, a 30% sediment porosity, and methane hydrate-forming gas composition, we find that the interval velocities observed in sediments above the BSR can be explained with a gas hydrate saturation of less than about 5% depending on hydrate habit. The accuracy of the gas hydrate saturation depends on the accuracy of the interval velocities, as the saturation of the different pore phases are calibrated to fit the 'observed\u2019 P-wave velocities. The interval velocities have low resolution, and hence the value of 5% gas hydrate saturation should be interpreted qualitatively as an indicator of low hydrate saturation in the system.\nDecreases in interval velocity from 1900 m\/s to 1700\u00a0m\/s (corresponding to a 220\u00a0m\/s decrease in interval velocity) are observed beneath the BSR in some places (Fig. 5A). This low-velocity zone is often associated with high amplitude reflections that lie subparallel to the BSR or terminate against it (Figs. 3\u20135). The decrease in interval velocities, together with the presence of high amplitude, negative polarity reflections, are consistent with the presence of free gas beneath the BGHSZ. Beneath this free gas zone, high-amplitude, positive polarity reflections are attributed to gas-water interfaces within stratigraphic layers underlying the BGHSZ (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992; Andreassen et al., 1997; Chabert et al., 2011; You et al., 2019).\nAt some locations, velocity inversions beneath the interpreted BSR are less pronounced, and interval velocities for sediments above the BSR fall within the range for potentially non-gas hydrate-bearing sediments (Fig. 5B). Lateral variations in interval velocity along the interpreted BSRs may reflect changes in the saturation of hydrate within the sediments (e.g., Chabert et al., 2011). However, as velocities available for this study have a relatively coarse vertical resolution (\u223c100\u00a0ms; Fig. 5), they may only represent averages of consecutive high- and low-velocity intervals. Nevertheless, BSRs and associated seismic velocities seem to indicate either the occurrence of overlying gas hydrate-bearing sediments showing higher interval velocities, or the presence of underlying free gas-bearing sediments showing lower interval velocities, or both (e.g., Gullapalli et al., 2019). To further support the hydrate-related nature of the identified BSRs, we compare the modelling of the BGHSZ with our seismic observations.\n\n\n4.4\nModelling of the BGHSZ\nWe tested several models using different geothermal gradients between 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and positive perturbations of seafloor temperature of up to 3\u00a0\u00b0C relative to the NOAA data-derived profile (Figures S1). Our results show that with the NOAA data-derived temperature profile (Figure S1), a 25\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 27\u00a0\u00b0C\/km geothermal gradient (Akbar, 2011) gives a BGHSZ much deeper than the seismically identified BSRs and outside their depth error estimates (Figure S2). A geothermal gradient of 27\u00a0\u00b0C\/km to 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Guha et al., 2010) provides a better fit between the calculated BGHSZ and BSRs, particularly a value of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (D; H\u2013H\u2019; I\u2013I\u2019 - Figure S2). Higher values are not reported in the Bangladesh offshore area and would result in a BGHSZ shallower than the seismically identified BSRs. We therefore set a 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km geothermal gradient as a reasonable parameter for the modelling. The calculated BGHSZ nonetheless remains deeper than the interpreted BSRs along some profiles (i.e., A-A\u2019; B\u2013B\u2019; C\u2013C\u2019; D\u2019; E-E\u2019; F\u2013F\u2019; G-G\u2019; Figure S2). On most profiles, a better fit is obtained by assuming a seafloor temperature increase between 2\u00a0\u00b0C and 3\u00a0\u00b0C (Figures S3, S4). Our selected model therefore uses a geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and a seafloor temperature 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C greater than NOAA data (Fig. 7\n), although we do not exclude that temperatures may vary along the seismic profiles.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe Bangladesh gas hydrate system\nOur seismic profile show the morphology of the upper Bengal fan delta front to exhibit an alternation of channel-levees, over bank deposits, mass-transport deposits (MTDs), and irregular features formed by sliding\/slumping (Figs. 2\u20133). We interpret the turbidites to result from confined flows in channel-levee complexes, recorded by fining upward patterns within the channel infill (Fig. 2F and 2I), whereas thin sand-shale alterations are more common in the levees and over bank deposits (Fig. 2F, 2H, 2IF, H, 2I). Tabular-bedded deposits, indicated as HARPS, are interpreted to record unconfined flows (i.e., flows not confined by levees) (Fig. 2F and I).\nThe identification of BSRs in this depositional setting provides insights into the presence and distribution of the natural gas hydrate system in the northern BoB (Fig. 6). BSRs are observed within slope deposits at depths of 250\u2013440 mbsf, in water depths of 1300\u20131900 m (Fig. 6). Slope deposits show an alternation of low and high amplitude reflections interpreted as interbedded sequences of sand, silt, and clay layers, mostly associated with turbidites and channel-levee deposits (Figs. 3 and 4). Although both coarse- and fine-grained intervals may contain gas hydrate, coarse-grained sediments (i.e. sands) generally show the highest gas hydrate saturation potential (e.g., Ginsburg et al., 2000; Boswell and Collett, 2006; Torres et al., 2008; Riedel et al., 2013a, b; Collett et al., 2014; Max and Johnson, 2014). BSRs in the Bangladesh EEZ are predominantly associated with high-amplitude, sheet-like deposits, which we interpret to record deposition during un-confined flows resulting from channel avulsion and\/or turbidity current over-flow (HARPS; Figs. 2H and 3), and with channel cut-and-fills deposits (Fig. 2I). MTDs identified within the slope region may have also played an important role in controlling the gas hydrate-bearing sediments. This is because MTDs provide a rapid accumulation of sedimentary material, which can contribute to changes in the thermal regime of the sub-seafloor sediments. Following these changes, the GHSZ will try to re-equilibrate to the new thermal structure making the BGHSZ to move upwards (e.g., Mandal et al., 2014).\nAlong east Indian margin most gas hydrate occurrences are also associated with deep-water fan deposits (i.e., channel-levee systems) likely to be sand prone reservoirs systems (Collett et al., 2019; Holland et al., 2019). Offshore Myanmar, drilling at the Shew gas field (Fig. 1) indicates hydrocarbon accumulations mainly within the distal lobe deposits (end of channel systems) formed by sandy turbidites (Yang and Kim, 2014); these sandy turbidites are capped by fine-grained (i.e., muddy) hemipelagic deposits, acting as an effective trap for hydrocarbon accumulation (Zhan et al., 2019).\nGiven the proximity and similarity of the Myanmar and eastern India depositional settings with the Bangladesh EEZ, and based on BSRs distribution on seismic data, we infer that coarse-grained deposits associated with confined (channel systems) and un-confined (i.e., turbidite) flows are the most likely to host gas hydrate accumulations within the Bangladesh EEZ.\n\n\n5.2\nBSR character and discontinuity\nThe BSRs identified offshore Bangladesh (Fig. 6) are variable in reflection strength and lateral continuity (Figs. 3 and 4). The seismic expression of a BSR can be controlled by many factors and may, for instance, result from the way in which gas hydrate forms and accumulates within a specific interval (e.g., Shukla et al., 2019), which in turn can be controlled by the way in which gas migrates into the GHSZ (You et al., 2019). For instance, dissolved methane is not sensitive to the capillary entry pressure of the hosting media either to eventual reductions of permeability induced by multi-phase flow and hydrate formation (Bear, 2013), and can migrate in solution until super-saturation induces its exsolution to form free gas accumulations or gas hydrates (Liu and Flemings, 2007). Migration in solution, therefore, likely creates a more homogeneous and laterally continuous distributions of gas hydrate within the GHSZ which may, in turn, result in a more continuous character of the BSR (Foschi et al., 2019). However, the presence of a continuous BSR (Fig. 3C) could also be an indicator of free gas being dispersed in the pores below the BGHSZ, rather than the presence of significant gas hydrate above it (e.g., Holbrook et al., 1996; Max and Johnson, 2014).\nWhen methane migrates in gas phase it may be restricted to pathways with sufficiently large pores and low capillary entry pressures, allowing pore invasion and displacement of the resident pore water (e.g., Fauria and Rempel, 2011). Migration across low-permeability formations may still occur, but it would require gas overpressure able to breach eventual sealing units and form fractures (Cartwright and Santamarina, 2015). Essentially, the focused distribution of available free gas and migration pathways will control the eventual distribution of gas hydrate (e.g., Hillman et al., 2017; You et al., 2019), and may result in a more discontinuous character of the seismic BSR (e.g., Hustoft et al., 2007; Shedd et al., 2012). Although our observed BSRs are quite discontinuous or even absent in places (i.e., Figs. 3A and 3B, 4), their absence does not rule out the presence of gas hydrate which may be present at low saturations (e.g., Chabert et al., 2011).\nActive fluid flow through the GHSZ (e.g., Ramana et al., 2006), often associated with the presence of active faulting (e.g., Fichler et al., 2005), can also have a strong impact on BSR continuity. Our seismic data show that fault and fracture systems reach and crosscut the GHSZ, sometimes also acting as conduits for the migration of fluids from deeper stratigraphic levels (Figs. 3 and 4). Deep fluid sourcing may be evidenced by the presence of low-velocity zones (Fig. 5) indicating free gas trapped beneath the BGHSZ by overlying gas hydrate-bearing sediments of low permeability (e.g., Wang et al., 2020). Gas-charged sediments and gas-water contacts can explain the presence of high amplitude reflections beneath the BSR (e.g., Judd and Hovland, 1992) (Figs. 3\u20135). Elsewhere, fluids entering the GHSZ via faults or fractures may continue migrating at rates too great to allow gas hydrate formation due to reaction kinetics (e.g., Fauria and Rempel, 2011), thus having an impact on hydrate equilibrium conditions.\nLateral variations in the BSR strength and continuity may also result from local perturbations of the gas hydrate stability field (e.g., Shukla et al., 2019). The presence of gas within the GHSZ is indicated by amplitude anomalies that partly or entirely obscure the BSR, which are observed in the shallower areas of its occurrence in water depths of 1300\u20131500\u00a0m (Figs. 3C and 4). The feather edge of the GHSZ, where the base GHSZ lies within tens of meters of seafloor, is considered to be more sensitive to climate-driven factors that may change stability conditions, such as sea level variations and sedimentation rate (Ruppel, 2011). In such a setting, gas hydrate dissociation may result in the release of gas and its migration to seafloor (e.g., Ketzer et al., 2020). However, our shallowest BSR lies at water depths around 1300 mbsl and depths \u2265250 mbsf (I\u2013I\u2032, Fig. 6), and so is unlikely to have been affected by such factors (Ruppel and Kessler, 2017). In the same areas, the presence of seafloor MTDs may be an evidence of past gas hydrate dissociation and\/or rapid migration of methane through faults and fractures to induce slope failure (Fig. 3B). Gas hydrate dissociation can increase local pore fluid pressure in sediment, depending on the ratio of fluid pressure dissipation to fluid release from dissociation, decreasing the effective normal stress and shear resistance (e.g., Hornbach et al., 2004), or ultimately triggering sediment collapse (De La Fuente et al., 2020).\n\n\n5.3\nSeismic velocities across the BSRs\nSeismic velocities can help to discriminate the nature of the acoustic impedance contrasts generating BSRs. In the Bangladesh offshore, interval velocities show that the BSR corresponds, in general, to the base of a higher velocity layer, indicating the likely presence of gas hydrate-bearing sediments (Fig. 5). Interval velocities from sediments outside interpreted BSR areas are generally lower and are presumably linked to non-gas-hydrate-bearing sediments (Fig. 5A). Beneath most areas of the BSR, a decrease in interval velocities is consistent with sediments that do not contain gas hydrate, but most likely contain free gas trapped beneath the GHSZ (Fig. 5). At some locations, the absence of a velocity increase above the BSR (i.e., D-D\u2032, H\u2013H\u2032, I\u2013I\u2019 - Fig. 5B) suggests either an absence of gas hydrate, or that the saturation of hydrate is too low to be resolved (Chabert et al., 2011). Considering the coarse vertical resolution of the interval velocities available for this study (\u223c100\u00a0ms), values for the BGHSZ may be an average of higher velocities due to gas hydrate above and lower velocities due to gas below, thus explaining the absence of an increase above the BSR (e.g., D-D\u2032, H\u2013H\u2032, I\u2013I\u2019 - Fig. 5B). Gas hydrate may also have a patchy distribution, but lateral variations in interval velocities along sedimentary layers are poorly constrained by wide picking intervals (i.e., 5\u00a0km along CDF lines).\nGas hydrates can occur anywhere within the GHSZ, but commonly show a heterogeneous distribution depending on the availability of hydrocarbon gas and pore water, salinity, permeability, porosity, etc. (e.g., Duan et al., 2011; Klauda and Sandler, 2005). At a given location, the top and bottom of the potential zone of gas hydrate occurrence are controlled by the gas (methane) solubility in the pore space and the availability of gas (Ruppel and Kessler, 2017). The top of the gas hydrate occurrence zone (e.g., Riedel and Collett, 2017) may be indicated by an increase in interval velocities, but it is not possible to recognize this offshore Bangladesh due to the low vertical resolution of seismic interval velocities. Another possible indication for the extent of the hydrate-bearing sediments is the presence of high amplitude, positive polarity reflections above the BSR (e.g., Posewang and Mienert, 1999). Strong reflections are observed above the BSR on CDF Line 06 (D-D\u2019; Fig. 5B), but nowhere else on our seismic data. The lack of strong reflections within the GHSZ may be due to a low (less than 5%) gas hydrate saturation in sediments, as estimated from seismic velocities.\nBeneath the BSR, the presence of free gas offers the most plausible explanation for the observed low-velocity zone corresponding to a decrease in P-wave velocities (Fig. 5). The presence of free gas can also explain the high-amplitude reflections, characterized by a negative acoustic impedance contrast followed by a positive acoustic impedance contrast, visible beneath the BSR, which often terminate against it (Figs. 4 and 5); these sub-parallel or dipping reflections may indicate the gas hydrate-free gas and free gas-water interfaces beneath the BGHSZ, respectively (Judd and Hovland, 1992).\nAlthough seismic velocities support their gas hydrate-related nature, the identified BSRs show a variable seismic character and distribution across the study area. This variability is further assessed comparing seismic observations with numerical modelling for the BGHSZ.\n\n\n5.4\nTheoretical BGHSZ\nThe depth of the interpreted BSR generally shows a good match with the calculated BGHSZ, further supporting the gas hydrate-related nature of the BSR (Fig. 7). However, clear offsets are observed in some lines (yellow boxes - Fig. 7).\nThe offsets between observed BSRs and calculated BGHSZ cannot be related to seismic picking errors along the BSR, as this is estimated to be within a maximum of 8\u201315\u00a0m (distance from top to bottom of the negative peak along which the BSRs are interpreted). These offsets may be related to uncertainty in choosing model parameters for the calculated BGHSZ. Assuming a constant 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C seafloor temperature increase, model fit is improved by using a 27\u00a0\u00b0C\/km instead of a 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km geothermal gradient at some locations (Figure S4). BSRs in the E-SE part of the study area are best-fit by a BGHSZ calculated assuming a 27\u00a0\u00b0C\/km geothermal gradient, or by an intermediate geothermal gradient between 27\u00a0\u00b0C\/km and 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Fig. 6; Figure S4). BSRs in the central and W-NW area are instead best-fit assuming a geothermal gradient \u226530\u00a0\u00b0C\/km (Fig. 6; Figure S4). This suggests that geothermal gradient may vary up to 3\u00a0\u00b0C\/km, with higher values to the W-NW and lower values to the E-SE part of the Bangladesh EEZ (Fig. 6). A similar spatial trend was inferred from down-hole temperature measurements along the shelf domain (Guha et al., 2010). However, along-slope variation in geothermal gradients does not explain the observed sudden changes in BSR morphology, including vertical offsets (of up to 100\u00a0m) which do not follow seafloor topographic trends (i.e., A-A\u2019; C\u2013C\u2019; D-; Fig. 7).\nThe depth of the BSR can be influenced by several mechanisms that affect the thickness of the GHSZ, including sediment type (i.e., texture, mineralogy, and porosity) and salinity (e.g., Clennell et al., 1999; Sahoo et al., 2018). Nucleation kinetics of gas hydrate and\/or of free gas bubbles may be inhibited by confinement of the methane-bearing fluid in small pores, and equilibration may also be limited by rates of diffusion of gas, water, and salt components or by advective flows of fluid or heat (e.g., Henry et al., 1999). However, local variations in salinity and\/or pore-size produce only moderate shifts in the position of the gas hydrate stability field (e.g., Milkov and Sassen, 2001; Foschi et al., 2019), which cannot explain vertical shifts of up to 100\u00a0m as observed in our data (i.e., A-A\u2019; Fig. 7).\nThe depth of the BGHSZ is sensitive to both thermal perturbation and to changes in the hydrate-forming gas composition (e.g., You et al., 2019). Most observed offsets between the BSR and the calculated BGHSZ are close to fault\/fracture systems, often associated with evidence for fluid migration (Figs. 7 and 8\n). Fluid migrating through fault systems can be associate with the transport both of heat (e.g., Sain et al., 2011; Shedd et al., 2012), and of deeply sourced thermogenic gases (e.g., Kvenvolden, 1993).\nIn areas where the BSR is shallower than the BGHSZ (C\u2013C\u2019; Fig. 7), the upward shift may be due to warm fluids rising along faults\/fractures observed on seismic data (C\u2013C\u2019; Figs. 7 and 8). However, in most locations BSRs lie deeper than the calculated BGHSZ (A-A\u2032, D-, I\u2013I\u2019; Fig. 7), and are also characterized by the presence of deep fault systems terminating at the BSR or crossing the GHSZ (A-A\u2032, D-, I\u2013I\u2019; Fig. 8). At these locations, the deepening of the BSR could be explained by the presence (even in small amounts) of heavier molecular hydrocarbons (e.g., Collett et al., 2009; Sloan and Koh, 2008; You et al., 2019). Heavier molecular hydrocarbons originating at depth may migrate upwards through focused pathways such as faults and fractures, or simply via diffusion through permeable layers, and increase the thickness of the GHSZ (e.g., Hillman et al., 2017). The presence of deep faults (>1\u00a0km bsf; Fig. 4D) reaching and crosscutting the GHSZ and the seismic evidence for fluid flow along them, together with the presence of low-velocity zones associated with high amplitude seismic anomalies sub-parallel or dipping and terminating against the BSR (Fig. 5), are strong indicators for the existence of a deeper, thermogenic gas (e.g., Hillman et al., 2017; Shukla et al., 2019). Along the east Indian continental margin, seismic data have revealed the presence of faults extending from the near surface to approximately 2000 mbsf within the expected temperature zone of thermogenic hydrocarbon generation; these faults may have acted as conduits for thermogenic gas migration from deep to shallow levels (e.g., Dewangan et al., 2011).\nStudies in diverse geological settings containing gas hydrate have indicated contributions from both microbial and thermogenic methane (e.g., Bourry et al., 2009; Kroeger et al., 2015; Dumke et al., 2016; Hillman et al., 2017; Minshull et al., 2020). A recent study in the Gulf of Mexico has shown that a gradual change in gas mixtures (from thermogenic to microbial sources) may influence the thickness of the GHSZ, and result in non-seafloor parallel BSRs (Portnov et al., 2021). Previous work suggests that the gas hydrate system we identify offshore Bangladesh is also likely to be characterized by mixed gas compositions. Methane concentrations related to bacterial methanogenesis and bacterial oxidation have been detected offshore Bangladesh in surface waters and in continental shelf deposits close to the Ganges-Brahmaputra mouth (Berner et al., 2003). In addition, studies on gas seeps onshore and offshore Bangladesh have shown that, with exception of small bacterial contributions in some surface seep gases and two subsurface accumulations, the gas is predominantly thermogenic (including higher molecular hydrocarbon gases i.e., ethane, butane) sourced at peak generation depths of at least 6\u00a0km within Miocene formations (Curiale et al., 2002). Several thermogenic gas sources may be available in this area, as supported by the existence of deep hydrocarbon systems offshore Bangladesh (Eocene-Oligocene age; Imam and Hussain, 2002), and by reports coming from onshore and offshore exploration wells of commercial discoveries of natural gas in sandstones of the Miocene-Pliocene Surma Group (i.e., Sangu and Kutubdia gas fields; Imam and Hussain, 2002) (Fig. 1). Deeply sourced thermogenic gas may have migrated through faults and\/or permeable layers accumulating within shallower sedimentary units. Gas accumulations at different depth in sediments of the Bangladesh continental shelf is reported in the BODC-3 exploration well (Figs. 1 and 6), and correlated to bright spots at depths between 1000 and 2400\u00a0m bsf (BODC-3 Completion Report, 1978).\nBased on the above evidence, we suggest that localized fluid flow through faults\/fractures may explain the offsets that we observed between the BSR and the calculated BGHSZ (Fig. 7). We recognize that gas hydrate stability may also be influenced by variations in heat-flow that depend on rates of sedimentation as well as sediment type (Hutchison, 1985), different lithologies having different thermal conductivity. However, localized changes due to fluid flow through structural elements (faults\/fractures) are considered to have a primary control on heat flow in the near-surface sediments of the study area. The rise of warm fluids through fault and\/or fracture systems can explain observed BSRs shallower than the modelled BGHSZ (i.e., left end-side of C\u2013C\u2019; Figs. 7 and 8). A similar finding is available from the east Indian margin, where fault and fracture systems related to neo-tectonic activity have been estimated to generate a 15\u201320% increase in heat-flow due to the upward migration of deeply sourced fluids, influencing the distribution of gas hydrates (Dewangan et al., 2011). In addition, offshore Bangladesh, the supply of thermogenic hydrate-forming gases through fault and\/or fracture systems, can explain observed BSRs deeper than the modelled BGHSZ (i.e., A-A\u2032, D-D\u2032, I\u2013I\u2019; Figs. 7 and 8).\nOur results show the complexity of the gas hydrate system identified in the Bangladesh EEZ and highlights the need for further data to better understand the mismatches between seismic observations and modelling results. New surveys should consider the acquisition of 3D seismic reflection data, particularly focusing on the E-SE part of the study area where several BSRs have been identified along the CDF profiles (Fig. 6). 3D imaging at this location would provide better constraints on the spatial distribution and character of the gas hydrate accumulations, and their interaction with tectono-stratigraphic elements in the area. In addition, coring, drilling and downhole logging of physical properties (i.e., electrical resistivity, formation densities, sonic velocities, etc.) at selected locations would help to define the composition, saturation and thickness of the gas hydrate-bearing sections. As a priority location, coarse-grained beds associated with both confined and un-confined turbiditic flows seem to offer the most promising locations for gas hydrate reservoirs within the Bangladesh EEZ. The acquisition and integration of such data would help to guide the identification and characterization of gas hydrate-bearing sediments in order to assess potential exploitation targets in this promising, but yet underexplored, region.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis study provides on the first evidence of gas hydrate occurrence in the northern Bay of Bengal (BoB), offshore Bangladesh, and insights into the controls on its distribution and character. Seismic profiles reveal the presence of BSRs in water depths of 1300\u20131900 m, preferentially located in mixed-to coarse-grained deposits of the slope domain. Calculation of the stability zone for pure methane hydrate demonstrates the gas hydrate-related nature of the BSRs, with a good match between the calculated BGHSZ for a geothermal gradient of 30\u00a0\u00b0C\/km, and seafloor temperatures between 2.7\u00a0\u00b0C and 5.3\u00a0\u00b0C (+2.5\u00a0\u00b0C temperature increase from NOAA-derived temperatures). Nonetheless, in many places the BSR lies above or below the calculated BGHSZ, notably in close proximity to faults and fractures systems. Based on seismic observations, we infer that faults and fractures likely act as pathways for the upward migration of deeper fluids, creating local perturbations in heat-flow and\/or supplying heavier hydrate-forming gases that locally affect gas hydrate stability.\nThese initial results are promising in terms of the occurrence of gas hydrates offshore Bangladesh and should guide future research and exploration initiatives to identify new gas hydrate reservoirs, to better understand their spatial distribution and to quantify the total occurrence of gas hydrates in the EEZ of Bangladesh. Against the backdrop of increasing energy demand, gas hydrates represent a potential solution for the future energy security of Bangladesh.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nVanessa Monteleone: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.; Hector Marin-Moreno: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Validation, Supervision, Writing \u2013 review & editing.; Gaye Bayrakci: Conceptualization, Investigation, Validation, Supervision, Writing \u2013 review & editing; Angus I.

Similar to other discoveries in eastern China, petroleum in the Songliao Basin is typically within or associated with buried volcanic structures related to Mesozoic to Cenozoic rifting (Feng et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2017). Due to their architecture, petroleum systems in these buried volcanic edifices are fundamentally different from those associated with Paleozoic, tectonically overprinted and weathered systems, such as occur in western China (Feng et al., 2014), or with extensive basaltic magmatism and siliceous large igneous provinces (Rohrmann, 2007; Sruoga and Rubinstein, 2007). The sheet-like morphologies of large igneous provinces with extensive lava flows often act as regional seals with significantly greater prospectivity associated with sub magmatic traps than the relatively small igneous reservoirs (Rohrmann, 2007). In western China, due to post-magmatic tectonism, uplift and erosion, the original volcanic structures and facies successions are not well preserved and commonly separated from the cover sequence by a pronounced unconformity (Wenzhi et al., 2009). In contrast, examples of well-preserved Cretaceous and younger buried stratovolcanoes exist in offshore New Zealand sedimentary basins and are imaged by seismic reflection profiles (Bergmann et al., 1992; Bischoff et al., 2017, 2021; Infante-Paez and Marfurt, 2017; Morley, 2018; Kumar et al., 2019). In the Taranaki Basin buried volcanoes of Miocene age have arc affinities (King and Thrasher, 1996; Seebeck et al., 2014), a setting that is not commonly targeted for petroleum exploration globally. Nevertheless, non-commercial oil has been found within volcaniclastic rocks in one of these edifices, the Kora volcano in offshore northwestern New Zealand (Arco Petroleum New Zealand Inc., 1988; Bergmann et al., 1992).\nVolcanism and associated rocks, structures and processes can affect all petroleum systems elements, including reservoir and seal formation, and petroleum generation, migration and accumulation. Volcanic and associated epiclastic rocks vary widely in their physical properties. Depending on the volcanic lithofacies and the degree of alteration and burial they can be either potential seals or reservoirs (Wu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015; Wang and Chen, 2015; Zheng et al., 2018). Processes such as mineral alteration can either destroy or increase porosity and permeability in volcanic rocks and surrounding sedimentary rocks (Wu et al., 2006; Tari et al., 2021), while fracturing often further enhances permeability and reservoir capacity (Magara, 2003; Jiang et al., 2017). In addition, dissolution during subaerial exposure can further enhance the porosity and permeability of volcanic rocks, improving reservoir quality (Zou et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2017; Heap and Kennedy, 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Bischoff et al., 2021). Conversely, volcanic rocks can also provide sealing properties, particularly in rock types such as fine-grained tuffs, lithologies altered to bentonite, massive and non-fractured lavas or coherent subvolcanic igneous rocks (Wu et al., 2006). In other cases, overlying mudstones burying the volcanic edifice are reported to have provided a sealing cap for hydrocarbons (Magara, 2003).\nAlong with the complex architecture of reservoirs and seals within buried volcanoes, styles of petroleum entrapment can vary widely. Traps directly associated with the volcanic plumbing system can be formed by petrophysical contrasts between igneous rocks and their enclosing strata, as well as by deformation of pre-magmatic sequences due to the emplacement of shallow intrusions (Wu et al., 2006; Bischoff et al., 2017). These intrusion-related traps are often considered to be challenging petroleum exploration targets as rocks below volcanic edifices tend to be poorly imaged in reflection seismic data (Bischoff et al., 2017). Structural and paleogeomorphic traps related to buried volcanic edifices typically form by doming and deformation of pre and syn-magmatic strata and draping, differential compaction and faulting of overlying sedimentary successions (Bischoff et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2019). Sedimentary traps include onlap and lateral pinchout of sedimentary strata onto the volcanic edifice (Bischoff et al., 2017; Infante-Paez and Marfurt, 2017). Coarse clastic deposits from subaerial erosion of the volcano may provide reservoirs that are sealed by marine mudstones and shales deposited during the burial phase. In addition, volcanic activity is commonly related to extensional faults that may have been exploited by the magma (Tibaldi, 2015; Morley et al., 2018). Faulting may result in offset of reservoirs and provide migration pathways for petroleum accumulation within volcanic edifices (Feng et al., 2014; Wang and Chen, 2015).\nIn addition to providing structures and mechanisms for petroleum entrapment, volcanism may also play a role in petroleum generation due to heating during magmatic activity and by increasing the thermal gradients near the volcanic edifice (M\u00f8rk and Bjor\u00f8y, 1984; Magara, 2003; Holford et al., 2013; Infante-Paez and Marfurt, 2017; Kutovaya et al., 2019). Magmatic heating may either increase the prospectivity proximal to volcanic edifices by inducing maturation of an otherwise immature source rock or could lead to early overmaturation and source rock depletion around the volcano. Early generated petroleum may leak to the surface rather than accumulate in traps. Venting of greenhouse gases, particularly methane, derived from magmatic heating of organic-rich rocks can have a strong natural contribution to climate fluctuations (Kroeger et al., 2011; Heimdal et al., 2021). For example, it has been argued that on a much larger scale, heating of Cretaceous organic-rich rocks through extensive sill emplacement along the North Atlantic margin could have been one of the driving mechanisms for the Paleocene\u2012Eocene climate maximum (Dickens, 2004; Svensen et al., 2004).\nIn this study we examine how the emplacement and burial of a stratovolcano can impact the maturation, migration, entrapment and leakage of petroleum in sedimentary basins. We analyse the petroleum system associated with the buried Kora volcano in northern Taranaki Basin offshore northwestern New Zealand (Fig. 1\n) using 2D basin modelling. The Kora volcanic edifice is of particular interest due to the discovery of oil on its eastern flank (Arco Petroleum New Zealand Inc., 1988) and possibly related gas leakage suggested by bright spots above the apex and the flanks of the buried volcano (Infante-Paez and Marfurt, 2017; Kutovaya et al., 2019, Fig. 2\n). The architecture of the volcano, it's age and lithological composition has been well studied (Bergmann et al., 1992; Bischoff et al., 2017, 2021; Morley, 2018; Kumar et al., 2019). Previous modelling has addressed the thermal evolution and impact on petroleum generation (Stagpoole and Funnell, 2001; Kutovaya et al., 2019). Here, we focus on the petroleum plumbing system and potential of the buried Kora volcanic system as an analogue for petroleum systems associated with buried volcanoes globally. We investigate whether seismic reflection indications of gas trapped in strata overlying the Kora volcano may be related to fluids that leaked from the volcano and indicate an active petroleum system and seepage to the surface.\n\n1.1\nGeological setting and basin evolution\nThe Taranaki Basin is a Cretaceous\u2012Recent sedimentary basin situated largely offshore of New Zealand's North Island (Fig. 1). Two-phase rifting initiated the formation of the basin in the mid-Cretaceous and led to the separation of Zealandia from Gondwana in the Late Cretaceous (Gaina et al., 1998; Strogen et al., 2017). Terrestrial sandstones, mudstones and coal measures of the Rakopi Formation and the Wainui Member of the North Cape Formation were deposited in NW-trending rift grabens that accommodate up to \u223c4000\u00a0m of sedimentary strata (King and Thrasher, 1996; Raine and Schi\u00f8ler, 2012; Strogen et al., 2017, Fig. 3\n). From the latest Cretaceous onwards, marine deposits of the North Cape Formation transgressed over most of the Taranaki Basin. The northern part of the basin was dominated by deposition of distal fine-grained marine sediments of the Turi Formation through most of the Paleocene and Eocene (King and Thrasher, 1996). Intercalated into the Turi Formation is a 10\u201326\u00a0m thick oil-prone black shale unit, the Waipawa Formation (Killops et al., 1994; Sykes, 2008; Naeher et al., 2019), which is thought to have been deposited during a phase of climatic cooling and falling sea-level in the Late Paleocene (Hollis et al., 2014). The Turi Formation is overlain by sandstones of the Tangaroa Formation that were deposited as deepwater turbidite fans during a Late Eocene sea-level lowstand (Gresko et al., 1992; King and Thrasher, 1996).\nWhen the convergent plate boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates initiated in the Late Paleogene, most of the Taranaki Basin became initially starved of clastic input resulting in the deposition of carbonate-rich rocks of the Tikorangi and Taimana formations in the distal part of the basin (Strogen et al., 2014a). During the Miocene\u2012Recent the evolving plate boundary resulted in widespread hinterland uplift and the deposition of deep marine mud-dominated strata of the Manganui Formation (King and Thrasher, 1996; Bull et al., 2019). Sedimentation rates increased from 12\u00a0Ma onwards, when, after initial reverse faulting mainly at the eastern basin margin, extensional grabens formed in the northern Taranaki Basin (King and Thrasher, 1996). Miocene-Pleistocene normal faults partially re-activated N\u2013S oriented Cretaceous\u2012Paleocene normal faults (Giba et al., 2010), culminating with the opening of the Northern Taranaki Graben, a NNE-trending intra-arc rift system active from the mid Miocene to Pleistocene (Pilaar and Wakefield, 1978; King and Thrasher, 1996; Giba et al., 2010). During the Pliocene and Pleistocene, rapid shelf progradation resulted in the deposition of large, up to 2\u00a0km thick prograding foresets, overlain by relatively thin shelfal deposits (Hansen and Kamp, 2006; Salazar et al., 2015; Anell and Midtkandal, 2017).\n\n\n1.2\nVolcanism\nThe evolution of Zealandia throughout Cretaceous\u2012Recent times was accompanied by widespread igneous activity (Timm et al., 2010; Bischoff et al., 2020; Barrier et al., 2021). In Taranaki Basin, syn-rift Cretaceous volcanism occurred seaward of the present-day Taranaki Basin shelf (Fig. 1), forming a series of large (>5\u00a0km3) volcanic complexes aligned with concurrent Cretaceous faults (Bischoff et al., 2020; Uruski, 2020). The Paleocene-Eocene is characterized by clusters of small-volume (<1\u00a0km3) volcanoes, likely associated with the widespread Cenozoic intraplate volcanic activity in Zealandia and western Australia (Bischoff et al., 2020; Mortimer and Scott, 2020).\nMiocene volcanism in the Taranaki Basin started at ca. 19 Ma and became widespread from 16\u00a0Ma (Giba et al., 2013). Volcanic centers are aligned NE\u2012SW, parallel to the Hikurangi subduction margin east of New Zealand, where the Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Australian Plate (Giba et al., 2013; Seebeck et al., 2014). Subduction-related volcanism was dominantly of basaltic-andesitic calcalkaline composition and associated rocks display a typical island arc geochemistry (Bergmann et al., 1992; Seebeck et al., 2014 and references therein). The NE\u2012SW alignment of the volcanic arc has rotated by about 50\u00b0 from earlier, NNE\u2012SSW oriented activity that started at ca. 25 Ma (Seebeck et al., 2014). Since the Late Miocene, the arc migrated south-eastward due to slab roll-back to the present-day position in the Taupo Volcanic Zone and its NE extension (Seebeck et al., 2014; Mortimer and Scott, 2020, Fig. 1). Miocene volcanic activity in northern Taranaki Basin pre-dated the onset of widespread normal faulting, and although during the Late Miocene it was coeval to faulting, there is limited evidence for direct interaction with regional faulting (Giba et al., 2013). Instead, some volcanic edifices, such as Kora, are associated with Cretaceous rift-related normal faults, and ascending magma may have exploited these zones of weakness (Morley, 2018). However, in addition to re-activation of some of the Cretaceous faults in the Miocene, NE\u2012SW oriented or radial faults (e.g., Kora volcano) are locally associated with volcanic edifices (Giba et al., 2013; Morley, 2018; Bischoff et al., 2017, 2021).\nK\u2013Ar dating of volcanic clasts suggests that igneous activity at Kora may have started as early as 19\u00a0Ma (Bergmann et al., 1992). However, Ar\u2013Ar dating of in-situ phenocrysts and biostratigraphic ages from strata underlying volcanic rocks suggest that the main activity was between 16 and 12\u00a0Ma (Bergmann et al., 1992). Activity resulted in doming of pre-magmatic strata and radial extension due to magma emplacement in the upper crust (depths <\u223c5\u00a0km) and the formation of a stratocone consisting of a central vent and several parasitic vents (Bischoff et al., 2017). Extrusive rocks comprise pyroclastic deposits interbedded with epiclastic sedimentary deposits (Bischoff et al., 2017, 2021). Volcanic activity was also accompanied by the emplacement of multiple sills and dikes beneath Kora's edifice (Bischoff et al., 2017; Morley, 2018; Kumar et al., 2019). During its activity, Kora formed a stratovolcano that may have risen from the deep marine seafloor to an elevation near or above sea-level (Bergmann et al., 1992). After activity ceased at ca. 8 Ma, the cone was partially eroded and eventually buried by marine strata during northward progradation of the Taranaki shelf (King and Thrasher, 1996; Bischoff et al., 2017; Bull et al., 2019).\n\n\n1.3\nPetroleum systems elements of the Kora volcanic system\nThe Taranaki Basin is New Zealand's only petroleum producing basin, with all commercial discoveries situated in the central and southern part of the basin, whilst wells in northern Taranaki Basin were dry or made only non-commercial discoveries. Several volcanic centers have been drilled, including the Cretaceous Romney structure in the deepwater Taranaki Basin seaward of the shelf (Romney-1; Rad, 2015, Fig. 1) and prospects related with the Miocene volcanic arc such as Mangaa and Albacore (Fig. 3). An oil discovery was made by the Kora-1 well, drilled on the eastern flank of the Kora volcanic structure in Miocene volcanic and epiclastic rocks, with additional oil shows in the Eocene Tangaroa Formation (Fig. 2). Oil in Miocene rocks in the Kora-1 well initially flowed at high rates of 1168 barrels per day, and, as tested by the Kora-1A sidetrack well at 668 barrels per day in a long-term test (Arco Petroleum NZ Inc, 1988). However, the 25\u00a0m column accumulation, with an estimated 15 MMbbl of oil in place (OMV New Zealand Ltd, 2011), ultimately was not deemed commercial. The discovery nevertheless led to the drilling of three further wells. Kora-3 and -2 in the eastern flank and near the crest of the volcano also encountered oil shows whereas Kora-4 in the southwestern flank was dry (Bergmann et al., 1992).\nLate Cretaceous rift-related coal-measures of the Rakopi Formation are the most widespread source rock in Taranaki Basin and sourced the largest petroleum discovery in Taranaki Basin, the >6 Tcf Maui Field (Sykes and Snowdon, 2002; Sykes et al., 2012; Kroeger et al., 2021). Similar deposits are likely present in the Cretaceous rift strata in northern Taranaki Basin (King and Thrasher, 1996, Fig. 3). By contrast, the Kora-1 discovery has a clear marine signature and was typed to the Late Paleocene Waipawa Formation (Killops et al., 1994; Sykes et al., 2012).\nThe Kora-1 well targeted the Tangaroa Formation that generally contains good quality reservoir sandstones. However, the interval drilled in Kora-1 had relatively poor reservoir quality with porosities of 10% due to cementation related to hydrothermal fluid circulation (Bergmann et al., 1992; OMV New Zealand Ltd, 2011). By contrast, good reservoir properties were identified in volcaniclastic rocks within and around the Kora volcanic edifice. Volcaniclastics successions form aprons on the flanks of the domed edifice and consist of sets of interbedded primary volcaniclastic and epiclastic deposits (Bischoff et al., 2021). The primary volcanic lithofacies consists of non-welded crystal-rich lapilli tuffs and tuff breccias. These are composed of large plagioclase and amphibole phenocrystals and fragments of volcanic rocks typically immersed in a fine to medium ash matrix. Epiclastic conglomerates typically consist of poorly sorted, sub-rounded volcanic clasts in a microcrystalline tuffaceous matrix. These primary and secondary volcaniclastic layers are generally massive or weakly bedded. Epiclastic deposits have an average porosity of 23% and up to 997 mD permeability, slightly higher than the porosity and permeability of primary volcaniclastic rocks (Bischoff et al., 2021). The high porosity of these rocks is primarily a consequence of extensive secondary mineral dissolution and fracturing. Tuffs are interbedded with epiclastic deposits throughout the Miocene syn-magmatic interval drilled by Kora 1\/1A. In the lower and upper part of the 800\u00a0m thick succession, epiclastic rocks are more dominant whereas in the middle part, Tuffs dominate (Fig. 2). The uppermost 4\u00a0m of the succession is formed by a marine sandstone consisting of reworked rounded volcanic clasts and bioclastic grains in a tight micritic matrix. This rock is well cemented but also contains pervasive fractures that increase porosity and permeability to over 10% and >0.1 mD, respectively (Bischoff et al., 2021). No lavas or subvolcanic rocks were intersected by wells and their extent and properties are unknown.\nThe Miocene volcanic and epiclastic rocks of the Kora stratovolcano are overlain by marine mudstones. However, the seal capacity of these mudstones is considered to be limited to a support an oil column of 40\u2013120\u00a0m, in part due to limited overburden (Bergmann et al., 1992). In addition, multiple faults offset the volcanic edifice and seal rocks, providing potential pathways for fluid migration and reservoir leakage (Bischoff et al., 2021).\n\n\n1.4\nPetroleum systems modelling\nA 2D basin model (Figs. 1 and 2) has been constructed using PetroMod v. 2020 software (Hantschel and Kauerauf, 2009) and a seismic profile from the Kora 3D seismic survey (PGS Geophysical, 2015). The modelling consists of four key components (model construction, thermal modelling, petroleum generation modelling and petroleum migration modelling), with the methods and data underpinning each discussed in the following sections.\n\n\n1.5\nModel construction\nThe 2D model was constructed using inline 1250 of the pre-stack depth migrated Kora 3D survey (PGS Geophysical, 2015) across the center of the Kora volcanic edifice and intersecting the Kora-1\/1A wells. The data have a dominant frequency of 45\u00a0Hz, corresponding to a vertical resolution of up to 30\u00a0m near the crater (Kumar et al., 2019). Reflection seismic data were depth migrated using Kirchhoff 3D pre-stack depth migration and calibrated using horizon picks in the Kora 1 to 4 wells (PGS Geophysical, 2015; see comparison of seismic reflection data with GR wireline log data of Kora-1 in Fig. 2). We have interpreted 16 seismic horizons in the seismic inline to define the geological architecture and to constrain the burial history in the model. The stratigraphy and ages of the mapped horizons are based on Bergmann et al. (1992), King and Thrasher (1996), Bland et al. (2013) and Strogen et al. (2014b). The stratigraphic framework was used to forward-model the evolution of the basin and the volcanic system from the Cretaceous to the present-day. The distribution of sedimentary and volcanic units was mapped from seismic data, following seismic volcano-stratigraphic principles and previous interpretations presented in the literature (Holford et al., 2012; Planke et al., 2015. Bischoff et al., 2017, 2021). Facies interpretation was supported by well log and core data from the well (i.e., Kora 1\/1A) intersected by the model (Arco Petroleum NZ Inc, 1988; Bischoff et al., 2021). Lithological composition and properties assigned to sedimentary facies and volcanic lithofacies (Table 1\n) are based on available well data and previous Taranaki Basin models (Funnell et al., 1996; Kroeger et al., 2017; Bischoff et al., 2021) as well as data from Kora-1\/1A (Arco Petroleum NZ Inc, 1988; Bischoff et al., 2021). Lithological properties define the modelled compaction during burial according to Athy's law (Athy, 1930). For volcaniclastic rocks, scenarios were computed using either a standard compaction model or a model with increased porosity due to secondary processes (Tables 1 and 2\n). The subsidence of the basin and the impact of magma emplacement and evolution of the volcanic edifice was modelled by adjusting the paleobathymetry, using the geometry of the mapped surfaces as a proxy for water depth and the age of a given horizon.\n\n\n1.6\nThermal modelling\nTo constrain the timing of source rock maturation relative to the evolution of the volcanic edifice and the formation of reservoirs, seals and traps we have reconstructed the thermal evolution of the basin. The thermal model was calibrated using corrected bottom hole temperature (BHT; Funnell et al., 2007), drill stem test temperature (DST, Clayton, 2011) and vitrinite reflectance data at Kora-1 (Analabs, 1988, Fig. 4\n). Vitrinite reflectance data below 3200 mbsl reach values of 1.47\u20131.57% Ro (Fig. 4). Previous modelling suggested that these high values are related to volcanic heating (Kutovaya et al., 2019).\nThe thermal basin model is constrained by boundary conditions defined at the seabed and the model base at 10\u00a0km depth derived from earlier models (Kroeger and Funnell, 2012; Kroeger et al., 2013, 2017). The derived heat flow at the base of the model during the Cenozoic varies between 54 and 60\u00a0mW\/m2\n(Fig. S1). Seabed\/surface temperature is based on Ridgway (1969), Hornibrook (1992) and Hollis et al. (2014) and varied between 4 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. S1). Magmatic heating was modelled using the intrusion tool in PetroMod\u2122 with properties derived from Lesher and Spera (2015) and Kutovaya et al. (2019; Table 3\n). Andesite intrusions were modelled to occur as single events at 14 and 12\u00a0Ma replacing sedimentary rocks in areas where igneous rocks are interpreted from the seismic data. Heating of adjacent rocks is assumed to occur exclusively by conductive heat transfer from the intrusive rock bodies. The cooling history of the igneous rocks and associated heat transfer is modelled using the thermodynamic properties specified in (Table 3). To compare the impact on the thermal history and petroleum generation, scenarios with and without magmatic heating were computed (Table 2). Doming implies that magma was also emplaced in the Cretaceous part of the sedimentary succession or the Upper Crust. However, reflection seismic data do not resolve such an intrusion (Bischoff et al., 2017). Previous modelling suggests that thermal effects of a deeper intrusion are not resolvable in well data, as the effect of subvolcanic intrusive heating on vitrinite reflectance would have overprinted the smaller effects of regional heating related to deeper magma emplacement (Kutovaya et al., 2019; see further discussion below). Regional changes in heat flow during Miocene magmatism are already incorporated in the model of Kroeger et al. (2013), which is used as the input for crustal heat flow.\n\n\n1.7\nPetroleum generation modelling\nTwo potential petroleum source rock intervals have previously been proposed to be present in the area, Late Cretaceous terrestrial coal measures and the Late Paleocene marine Waipawa Formation (King and Thrasher, 1996; Stagpoole and Funnell, 2001). The seismic character and geometry of a highly reflective interval in the Late Cretaceous succession adjacent to a fault related to Cretaceous rifting suggests the presence of coal measures and possibly later magmatic intrusions (Bischoff et al., 2017; Infante-Paez and Marfurt, 2017; Kumar et al., 2019; Morley, 2018, Fig. 2). Late Cretaceous coal measures of the Rakopi Formation and the Wainui Member of the North Cape Formation have been drilled by the Tane-1 well (King and Thraher, 1996; Raine and Schi\u00f8ler, 2012) and widely mapped across the northern Taranaki Basin (Arnot and Bland, 2016, Fig. 3). The up to 1500\u00a0m thick high amplitude interval on the flanks of the Kora structure (Fig. 2) is likely related to the Rakopi Formation, rather than the thinner Wainui Member of the North Cape Formation. However, regardless of strong indications, the presence of the Rakopi Formation in this region is unproven, and fluids generated from Late Cretaceous source rocks were so far not encountered in northern Taranaki Basin (Sykes et al., 2012). We therefore model scenarios with and without presence of a Rakopi Formation source rock (Table 2). To model petroleum generation in the Rakopi Formation we use Pepper and Corvi (1995) type III DE organofacies kinetic parameters, as in previous models (e.g. Funnell et al., 2007; Kroeger et al., 2017). Hydrogen Indices of the Rakopi Formation in Taranaki Basin average 300\u00a0mg HC\/g TOC (Sykes and Snowdon, 2002). The average total organic matter content (TOC) of the Rakopi Formation used in the model is 5%, based on data from the Tane-1 well (Matthews et al., 2011, Fig. 3).\nAnalogous to where it has been drilled by the Ariki-1 well, the Waipawa Formation is identified by a negative amplitude reflection at the top of the Paleocene interval in the seismic data (Fig. 2; Kutovaya et al., 2019). However, given the seismic resolution at this depth, it is difficult to map the thickness of the Waipawa Formation from seismic data. Proven thickness of the Waipawa Formation ranges from 10\u00a0m in the nearby Ariki-1 well (Fig. 3) to up to 40\u00a0m, where it outcrops in northern North Island (Sykes, 2008). A thicker unit may have been deposited in Cretaceous-Paleocene grabens proximal to Kora, as opposed to that drilled by wells on structural highs. To account for this uncertainty, we model scenarios using an average thickness of the Waipawa Formation of either 10\u00a0m or 30\u00a0m (Table 2). Waipawa black shale sample analysis yielded an average HI of 400 mgHC\/gTOC and 10.5% TOC (Sykes, 2008). For petroleum generation modelling we use kinetics of Johansen (2005), derived from Waipawa Formation samples.\n\n\n1.8\nPetroleum migration modelling\nFor petroleum migration modelling a hybrid approach was adopted using Darcy flow migration and invasion percolation (Carruthers and van Wijngaarden, 2000; Hantschel and Kauerauf, 2009). The Darcy flow method is used for rocks with low permeabilities, whereas invasion percolation is used for more permeable rocks. The threshold permeability above which invasion percolation is used is lithology dependent and set at 100 mD at 30% porosity. In the Darcy flow method, the flow potential is calculated based on petroleum saturation and pressure differences between cells, resulting in a predicted flow rate. In the invasion percolation method, flow in permeable rocks is assumed to occur instantly within geological timescales. Flow occurs if the fluid pressure overcomes the capillary entry pressure for the target cell, depending on the in situ lithological properties and pressures in that cell. In addition to lithological properties, faults and their properties play an important role in petroleum migration (Manzocchi et al., 2010; Fisher et al., 2018; Kroeger et al., 2021). In PetroMod\u2122, fault migration is computed using the invasion percolation method, where capillary entry pressures for the fault and for all potential outflow cells control flow through or across a fault (Hantschel and Kauerauf, 2009). We model scenarios where faults are either open to migration or have no effect on migration (Table 2). In scenarios allowing fluid migration through faults, cells surrounding the faults are refined (re-gridded to a smaller size) for better pressure calculation, whereas the faults themselves have no associated thickness. Instead, flow is controlled by the properties and pressure conditions in the in- and outflow cells adjacent to the faults rather than properties specifically assigned to the fault itself.\nFour faults were mapped (Fig. 2), two on each side of the Kora volcanic edifice. All faults originated as Cretaceous graben faults and are associated with a synsedimentary change in thickness of Cretaceous\u2012Paleocene strata. The two faults east of the volcanic edifice were re-activated during Miocene graben formation (Giba et al., 2010). The one closer to the paleo-vent has a post-Paleocene vertical displacement of up to 200\u00a0m and offsets strata as young as Pleistocene in age.\n\n\n1.9\nThermal history and magmatic heating\nThe PetroMod\u2122 modelling results provide an excellent fit to DST temperature data, whereas the model predicts up to 17\u00a0\u00b0C higher temperatures than suggested by two of the corrected BHT measurements reported in Funnell et al. (2007; Fig. 4a). These differences suggest that some BHT data may have not been fully corrected for the disturbance of formation temperatures by drilling. Present-day predicted temperatures are very similar in both models a) taking into account the thermal effects of magma intrusion (scenario 1, Table 2; Fig. 4a) and b) not using magmatic heating (scenario 2, Table 2; Fig. 4b). This suggests that for the present day there are no discernible thermal effects of Miocene magmatism. Conversely, vitrinite reflectance predicted by three different kinetics (Sweeney and Burnham, 1990; Nielsen et al., 2017; Burnham, 2019), shows a marked response to magmatic heating (Fig. 4c). Since vitrinite reflectance responds to the temperature history, the model with magmatic heating provides a much better fit to measured vitrinite reflectance data (Fig. 4c and d). These results are consistent with earlier models of Kutovaya et al. (2019).\nModel results suggest that conductive heat transfer from hot magma leads to a steep temperature gradient within a \u223c3\u00a0km radius of influence around the central conduct and vent zone (Fig. 5\n). The model predicts that a maximum extent of magmatic heating has been reached 10 kyrs after volcanic activity started. The modelled heating events are followed by rapid cooling. A thermal gradient similar to the gradient prior to magmatic activity is then re-established within 5 Myrs following the heating event (Fig. 6\na).\n\n\n1.10\nPetroleum generation\nModel results suggest that heating related to volcanic activity had a significant impact on source rocks and resulted in rapid petroleum generation within the \u223c3\u00a0km radius of influence around the central conduit and vent zone (Fig. 5\u20127). Complete maturation of the Waipawa Formation near the volcanic vent is predicted to have occurred within 10 kyrs after the first modelled volcanic activity at 14\u00a0Ma (Figs. 6b and 7\na). Complete maturation of the Rakopi Formation is predicted to have occurred within 2 Myrs following the modelled start of magmatic heating (Fig. 7b). Beyond the \u223c3\u00a0km radius of thermal influence of volcanism, petroleum generation was largely controlled by the depth of burial of the source rocks (Figs. 6c and d and 7c and d). Therefore, at the more deeply buried eastern side of the transect, away from the volcanic edifice, twice as much oil was generated during the Paleocene-Oligocene, before volcanic activity began (Figs. 6d and 7b and d). The rate of oil generation in the eastern part of the transect is predicted to have increased in the Middle Miocene, \u223c2 Myrs before the modelled onset of volcanic activity, due to increased sedimentation rates. The start of oil and gas expulsion, however, in the model, coincides with the beginning of volcanic activity (Fig. 7). Closer to the volcanic main vent zone, expulsion resulted from magmatic heating, whereas further away, it was related to rapid burial by volcaniclastic rocks.\n\n\n1.11\nMigration and charge\nSix different scenarios were computed (Table 2), four of which reproduced an oil accumulation with a column height of up to 42\u00a0m at the structure that was drilled by the Kora-1 well (Fig. 8\n). Consistent with the accumulation encountered by the well, this accumulation is predicted to have been charged from the Waipawa Formation. This was a robust result reproduced in all models run with fault migration and secondary increase of porosity in volcanoclastic sediments. Scenarios that didn't reproduce an accumulation in the Kora-1 structure either did not consider faults as migration pathways (scenario 3, Table 2, Fig. 9\na) or assumed standard compaction for volcaniclastic rocks and no secondary increase in porosity and permeability (Fig. 9b). In all scenarios except scenario 3, faults east of the volcanic edifice acted as pathways for petroleum migration through the relatively impermeable lower Eocene and Oligocene rocks (Figs. 8 and 9). Petroleum is predicted to have then migrated upward through the Miocene succession. Waipawa oil that migrated through the easternmost of the modelled faults is predicted to have separated from the gas phase, with the oil migrating upward along volcaniclastic rocks and accumulating in the structure drilled by Kora-1. Gas is predicted to have leaked through latest Miocene to Pliocene marine mudstones covering the volcaniclastic sequence (Fig. 8). A similar migration pathway associated with a small accumulation and gas leakage to the surface is predicted for the fault closer to the volcanic edifice (Fig. 8). Waipawa oil and exsolving gas is also predicted to have leaked from the small accumulation associated with this migration pathway. In the scenario without faults, only a small proportion of expelled oil migrated through the relatively impermeable lower Eocene interval and reached the Miocene interval. West of the volcanic edifice, faults acting as migration pathways do not intersect the Eocene interval. Hence, even in the scenario with faults open to petroleum migration, little oil reached the Miocene interval and was instead trapped in the Tangaroa Formation. Conversely, models predict the potential for significant amounts of gas generated from the Rakopi Formation to have breached through the sealing lower Eocene and Oligocene intervals and accumulated in Miocene volcaniclastic rocks on the western side of the volcanic edifice (Fig. 8), although the size and location of such predicted accumulations is indicative only, due to the constraints of a 2D model.\nModels predict that there is little potential for petroleum accumulation in the volcaniclastic interval before deposition of the Latest Miocene to Pleistocene marine cover sequence (Fig. 8b and c). The sealing potential of rocks overlying the volcaniclastic interval increased from the latest Miocene onwards due to increasing overburden and compaction. In the model, petroleum started to accumulate near Kora-1 when capillary entry pressure for oil in the overlying seal reached 0.18\u00a0MPa. Prior to that time, petroleum is predicted to have leaked to the surface (Fig. 8b and c). Leaking petroleum included early generated oil from the Rakopi Formation beyond the radius affected by volcanic heating as well as petroleum rapidly generated during Middle Miocene volcanic activity. Therefore, most petroleum generated during volcanic activity was not preserved. Some potential for early entrapment, however, existed in the Eocene Tangaroa Formation assuming volcanic rocks and\/or the overlying Oligocene calcareous rocks acted as seals (Fig. 8c). In addition to the predicted seal capacity some predicted early accumulations are subject to the reconstruction of paleo-waterdepth.\nThe comparison of scenarios with and without volcanic heating (scenarios 1 and 2, Figs. 8 and 10\n), supports the notion that volcanic heating reduced the oil accumulation potential in the Kora volcanic edifice due to early generation and leakage. Overall, the predicted hydrocarbon leakage amounts to up to 10 Mtons\/Myr across the model (Fig. 11\n), equivalent to 0.5 Mtons\/km2\/Myr. Additional scenarios were modelled to test the effects of lower reservoir quality of the volcaniclastic rocks (scenario 4, Table 2, Fig. 9b), variations in the thickness of the Waipawa Formation (scenario 5, Table 2), and the absence of coaly source rocks in the Rakopi Formation (scenario 6, Table 2, Fig. 9c). The results show that assuming reservoir properties consistent with normal compaction rather than an enhanced permeability due to fracturing and diagenesis (Bischoff et al., 2021) reduces predicted petroleum accumulations in these rocks and the accumulation in the Kora-1 structure was not predicted (Fig. 9b). Conversely, results for scenario 5 suggests that a thinner Waipawa Formation would still have provided sufficient charge for the accumulation in the Kora-1 structure. Assuming no source rock in the Rakopi Formation reduces the number and size of predicted accumulations around the Kora volcanic edifice (Fig. 9c), but again, demonstrates that the accumulation in the Kora-1 structure could have been charged exclusively from the Waipawa Formation. However, this scenario also predicts a much smaller amount of gas leakage into the overlying post-volcanic marine sequence.\nTo test whether the amplitude anomalies in the marine sequence could also be related to biogenic methane rather than thermogenic gas, we have run an additional scenario with no petroleum generation from the Rakopi Formation, but, instead, with biogenic gas generation in the marine cover sequence using the approach detailed in Kroeger et al. (2015). Similar to scenario 1 with the Rakopi Formation generating petroleum (Fig. 8a), the model with biogenic gas generation predicts focused migration of gas along faults through the marine cover sequence (Fig. 12\n). Both scenarios are thus consistent with the presence of free gas, as suggested by a high amplitude anomaly in reflection seismic data (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n2\nDiscussion\nPetroleum systems modelling of the Kora-1 volcanic structure approximately reproduced the small accumulation encountered in Miocene volcaniclastic rocks by the Kora-1 well (predicted column height 42\u00a0m versus 25\u00a0m observed). The associated petroleum system is summarized in Fig. 13\n. Consistent with geochemical analysis of Killops et al. (1994) and Sykes et al. (2012), this accumulation is predicted to have been charged from the marine Waipawa Formation rather than from coaly source rocks in the Rakopi Formation. Nevertheless, highly reflective intervals in Cretaceous fault bounded graben structures suggest that coaly source rocks of the Rakopi Formation are present. Petroleum expulsion and migration from these source rocks in depocenters to the southeast and southwest of the Kora structure (Fig. 3) is predicted to charge additional accumulations in volcaniclastic rocks. Models suggest that in a radius of \u223c3\u00a0km around the volcanic vent, rapid maturation of Waipawa and Rakopi formation source rocks has occurred during volcanic activity peaking between 14 and 12\u00a0Ma. A large proportion of petroleum generated during this time is predicted to have leaked to the surface. Leaking petroleum included early generated oil further away from the active volcanic cone that migrated towards the volcano due to doming. This is predicted to have significantly reduced the oil potential in the volcanic edifice.\nPetroleum accumulation is predicted to have occurred after volcanic activity ceased and sufficient overburden was present to seal the accumulation (Fig. 13). However, lack of sufficient seal capacity of the marine mudstone overburden and extensive fracturing of volcanic and sedimentary rocks during and after volcanic activity is inferred to have prevented larger accumulations, as previously suggested by Bergmann et al. (1992) and Bischoff et al. (2021), who also considered seal as a limiting factor. Conversely, charge in the model is not predicted to have been limited by source rock volume, as models with different assumptions for the thickness of the Waipawa Formation predict the same column height accumulation. Predicted leakage through the seal above the structure drilled by Kora-1 is shown in Fig. 8a. Differences between the drilled oil column (25\u00a0m) and the predicted accumulation of petroleum at the Kora-1 well (up to 42\u00a0m) could be explained by differences between predicted and actual seal strength or in the timing of charge as containment of an earlier charge would be further limited by a poorly developed seal.\nModelling emphasized the importance of faults in charging the Kora-1 structure accumulation. The presence of faults that are open for petroleum migration is consistent with high amplitude reflections suggesting gas charge in the cover sequence that are associated with the most prominent reactivated fault east of the crest of the Kora volcano (Fig. 2). In the absence of fault migration through fine-grained Lower Eocene and Oligocene rocks, no charge of the Kora-1 structure is predicted (Fig. 9a). This is consistent with earlier modelling of Funnell et al. (2007), who found that without faults facilitating migration through the Turi Formation, petroleum generation in the relatively thin Waipawa Formation would be insufficient to charge Eocene or Miocene traps. However, charge of the Kora-1 structure is not predicted to have occurred entirely through fault migration. Instead, petroleum is predicted to have bled off the fault and to have vertically migrated through the Miocene succession rather than drained to the surface. Therefore, the permeability of the Miocene succession is also important for charge to occur. Building a basin-wide petroleum systems model requires significant simplification, and hence the complex architecture of the volcaniclastic succession with widely varying rock properties cannot be entirely reproduced. However, the results of the basin models do suggest that rather than migration occurring solely through permeable faults, permeable volcanic and epiclastic lithologies of the volcaniclastic succession are also sufficiently connected to allow petroleum migration. Conversely, and consistent with petrophysical analysis (Bischoff et al., 2021), there is no indication of the presence of effective seals within the volcaniclastic succession. Hence, sufficiently unaltered fine-grained volcaniclastic rocks that could act as seals as proposed by Wu et al. (2006) do not appear to be present or widespread enough to act as a seal in the Kora structure.\nThe standard approach for predicting the permeability of sedimentary rocks in basin models is through calculating reduction of porosity during burial and compaction using an exponential relationship (Athy, 1930). However, modelling shows that secondary porosity and permeability enhancement is critical for suitable reservoir presence and migration pathways to charge the petroleum accumulation in the Kora-1 structure. This is consistent with most observations of volcanic reservoirs that are typically controlled by mineral dissolution and fracturing (Magara, 2003; Wu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015; Wang and Chen, 2015; Jiang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018; Bischoff et al., 2021). Such secondary porosity and permeability enhancement follows relationships that cannot be described by a single function.\nAll scenarios also predicted accumulations in the Tangaroa Formation in local highs and at the contact with modelled igneous subvolcanic intrusions (Figs. 8\u201310). In the absence of petrophysical information, igneous subvolcanic rocks and intrusions were generally modelled to be impermeable. Again, this is a significant simplification as these rocks can similarly be affected by mineral alteration and fracturing as volcaniclastic rocks and often form good quality reservoirs (Wang and Chen, 2015). While amplitude anomalies appear to be associated mainly with faults rather than direct leakage through the central vent area (Fig. 2), it cannot be discounted that leakage has also occurred directly through the central Kora volcanic edifice and through igneous rocks, contributing to the gas anomaly above the top of the structure. In addition, the reservoir properties of the Tangaroa Formation in the model have been solely controlled by its composition and predicted compaction. However, at Kora-1, the porosity of the Tangaroa Formation has been found to have been reduced to 10%, due to quartz and calcite cementation inferred to be related to sub-volcanic hydrothermal activity (Bergmann et al., 1992; OMV New Zealand Ltd, 2011). Nevertheless, charge of the Tangaroa Formation is consistent with shows encountered in the Kora-1 well (Arco Petroleum NZ Inc, 1988). Better reservoir properties in the Tangaroa Formation encountered in the Kora-4 well suggest that alteration of this formation is variable and that there is potential for accumulations in the Tangaroa Formation as predicted by the model. This is supported by the thermal model calibration that is consistent with predominantly conductive heating and doesn't require hydrothermal heating. Hydrothermal activity may have influenced a larger area than the radius of conductive heating predicted by the model and thus affected petroleum generation, migration and accumulation in ways not accounted for in this study. Similarly, the poorly constrained effects of a deeper intrusion were not considered in the model. Such an intrusion could have increased thermal gradients over a wider area around the Kora edifice and could have resulted in more petroleum generation and leakage during magmatic activity.\nWhilst, consistent with geochemical data, the accumulation in the Kora-1 structure is predicted to have been charged almost exclusively by Waipawa oil, modelling shows that presence of a Rakopi Formation source rock is critical for charging additional accumulations in volcanosedimentary rocks on the western side of the Kora volcanic structure. The predicted potential for oil and gas expulsion from the Rakopi Formation is a significant result for petroleum prospectivity in northern Taranaki Basin, where so far, no significant discoveries related to petroleum generation from Late Cretaceous source rocks have been made (Sykes et al., 2012), despite the widespread mapped occurrence of the interval (Arnot and Bland, 2016, Fig. 3). However, as all encountered fluids in Miocene rocks have been typed to the Waipawa Formation (Killops et al., 1994; Sykes et al., 2012), the only possible evidence for petroleum generation from the Rakopi Formation around the Kora volcanic structure remains to be the widespread occurrence of seismic reflection anomalies in the marine cover sequence that are likely related to gas (Fig. 2). Modelling suggests that such gas accumulations are unlikely to be linked to gas migrated from the Waipawa Formation alone, due to the smaller quantity of gas expelled. However, modelling is also consistent with a possible biogenic origin of the gas. A third possibility is that the gas could be CO2, either related to exsolution from the aqueous phase after volcanic activity and cooling of magma (Guilbert and Park, 1986) or derived from coaly source rocks heated by intrusions (Schmidt and McDonald, 1979; Surdam et al., 1984; Higgs et al., 2021). A volcanic source is questionable due to the long inactivity of the magmatic system. Further evidence could lie in the depth of amplitude anomalies since the bulk of any pure CO2 will be in a supercritical phase below a depth of 800\u00a0m (Law and Bachu, 1996), and hence less likely to cause amplitude anomalies. However, while the most pronounced likely gas related anomalies in the marine cover sequence are shallower than 800\u00a0m, some inverse polarity high amplitude reflections are observed at greater depth (Fig. 2).\nOver time, significant amounts of oil and gas are predicted to have leaked to the surface. Leaking petroleum has largely been generated from the Rakopi Formation in scenarios assuming presence of the source rock. Three main factors can be identified that drove leakage of petroleum: 1) early petroleum generation related to volcanic activity before deposition of regional seals, 2) the likelihood of connected permeability across the volcanic structure and effective migration to the surface, 3) doming related to magmatic activity, resulting in the migration and leakage of petroleum generated early beyond the radius of thermal heating through the volcanic edifice. These results significantly impact prospectivity, due to the volume of petroleum lost to the system. Specifically, the potential for discovering oil is significantly reduced due to the leakage of early generated oil. Widespread leakage through the seal is consistent with the common occurrence of oil residues in fractures in the degradational sandstones overlying the volcano-sedimentary succession (Bischoff et al., 2021).\nModelling predicts that petroleum has leaked over geological time at a rate of 0.5 Mtons of hydrocarbons\/km2\/Myr. The \u223c100\u00a0km2 Kora volcanic system could thus have emitted 50 Mtons of gas, with a large proportion of Methane per Million years, not taking into account any release of igneous CO2 directly sourced from the magmatic system. As Kora was only one of many Miocene volcanoes in Zealandia, many of which are located in petroliferous basins (Bischoff et al., 2020), the overall contribution to atmospheric methane and CO2 and impact on the carbon cycle could have been significant over geological time scales. On a global scale, carbon isotope perturbations, for instance at the onset of the Miocene Climate optimum have been attributed to extensive volcanism (Hodell and Woodruff, 1994; Holbourn et al., 2015). Our results highlight the potential for significant greenhouse gas emissions from volcanism in sedimentary basins with petroleum source rocks, similar to the effect of sill emplacement in the North Atlantic (Dickens, 2004; Svensen et al., 2004). As volcanism varied globally due to changes in plate convergence, this could have been a potential climate driver (Reagan et al., 2013).\nIn summary, modelling suggests that at the Kora volcanic edifice there is likely potential for further undiscovered accumulations. This potential depends to a large extent on petroleum generation from the Rakopi Formation and migration of petroleum from Cretaceous rift grabens situated to the southwest and southeast of Kora (Fig. 3). Accumulations are likely to be gas dominated, due to the early leakage of oil. Modelling results support the presence of extensive secondary porosity and permeability proposed for the Kora-1 structure (Bischoff et al., 2021) that has been documented in volcanic petroleum systems elsewhere (Wu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015; Wang and Chen, 2015; Zheng et al., 2018). Limiting factors may be fault leakage or the complex compartmentalization of reservoirs. However, the key limiting factor at Kora was found to be an insufficient seal. For these reasons, when looking at the petroleum potential of volcanic edifices, the size of the structure is likely deceiving in terms of its actual petroleum potential. As seal strength is likely to control the size of potential accumulations, the properties of the cover rock and the depth of burial, and hence also the age of the system are important. Similarly the importance of the sealing potential of marine sedimentary rocks overlying Neogene volcanics and its dependence on overburden has been demonstrated for several sites onshore Japan (Magara, 2003). These results are consistent with a dominance of small gas accumulations in relatively shallow (400\u20132000 m) volcanic reservoirs of relatively young (Cenozoic and Late Cretaceous) age worldwide (Feng, 2008). Conversely, reservoirs sealed by lacustrine mudstones in the in the Songliao Basin in northeast China, where some of the largest gas accumulations in volcanic rocks have been found, are buried to 2800\u20134500\u00a0m (Feng, 2008). Analysis of the oldest marine cover sediment at Kora suggests that a well cemented shallow marine rock was deposited during the early degradational phase of the volcanic edifice (Bischoff et al., 2021). In the case of the Kora structure, this sediment was also extensively fractured and hence has low sealing potential. Bischoff et al. (2021) propose that fracturing of this rock is due to Late Miocene tectonism related to the evolution of the Northern Graben system in Taranaki Basin (King and Thrasher, 1996). Hence, fracturing of these rocks may be specific to the structural evolution and late tectonism in Taranaki Basin. There are examples in China, often in areas with little post-magmatic tectonism, where rocks formed during the weathering and degradation stage have been found to be both reservoirs and effective seals (Zou et al., 2012, 2014). This underlines that understanding the sedimentary and tectonic history of the basin after volcanic activity ceased is critical for assessing the petroleum potential of buried volcanoes.\n\n\n3\nConclusions\nWe used the Miocene Kora stratovolcano in offshore northwestern New Zealand as an example to analyse factors controlling the petroleum potential and fluid flow in buried volcanic edifices. The results of a series of 2D basin modelling scenarios testing the influence of magmatic heating on source rock maturation, rock property distribution and fault migration indicate that multiple factors are critical for the accumulation of petroleum in buried stratovolcano edifices. These are:\n\n1)\nConsistent with petrophysical studies, modelling suggests that extensive fracturing and secondary porosity exist around volcanic edifices, resulting in connected permeability enabling fluid migration and enhancing reservoir potential despite the heterogeneity in volcanic and associated epiclastic rocks.\n\n\n2)\nFaults play an important role in migration through impermeable strata but also facilitate leakage to the surface.\n\n\n3)\nThe potential for petroleum accumulation is limited by seal strength, which is controlled by lithology, thickness and timing of deposition of a sedimentary cover sequence above the volcanic edifice.\n\n\n4)\nThe deposition of a well-cemented shallow marine degradational layer deposited when volcanic activity ceased can be critical for seal formation. The properties of such a deposit depend on the late tectonic and burial history, where in the case of the Kora volcano, Late Miocene extension has likely caused pervasive fracturing of these rocks and significantly reduced seal potential.\n\n\n5)\nPetroleum expulsion from source rocks further away from the volcano and unaffected by magmatic heating that allows petroleum to migrate into the volcanic structure after seal formation is important for charging accumulations.\n\n\n\nThese results emphasize that the geological setting and tectonic and burial history after volcanic activity is critical for the petroleum potential and fluid storage capacity of buried volcanic edifices. The predicted leakage of greenhouse gases from the Kora system associated with widespread Miocene volcanism in petroliferous basins on the Zealandia continent supports the notion that, on a global scale, greenhouse gas emission related to volcanism was significant in the Miocene and modified earth's climate over geological time scales.\n\n","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe presence of a thermally mature and viable source rock unit is one of the key risk factors in oil and gas exploration (White, 1993; Katz, 2005). Several factors may influence the development of a potential source rock unit, including primary organic production, preservation environment, and sedimentation rate (Pedersen and Calvert, 1990; Arthur et al., 1994; Calvert et al., 1996; Bohacs et al., 2005; Katz, 2005). In addition, the tectonic setting of a basin may represent an important first-order control on processes such as accommodation development (e.g. subsidence and burial) and water mass circulation that are vital for source rock development (Demaison et al., 1983; Gawthorpe et al., 2000). Across the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), Upper Jurassic organic-rich shales have traditionally been given the most attention, as these represent the main source rock unit charging most of the largest producing oil and gas fields (Demaison et al., 1983; Cooper et al., 1984; Isaksen et al., 2001; Mar\u00edn et al., 2020). This has left alternative source rock units to be considered as insignificant or even neglected (Ohm et al., 2008). This is also the case for the Barents Shelf, the northernmost and least explored hydrocarbon province of the NCS. Across large parts of the NCS, the widely distributed Upper Jurassic source rock unit was generally deposited during a period characterized by active faulting forming structurally restricted basins that were ideal sites for the accumulation and preservation of organic matter (e.g. Faleide et al., 1984; Leith et al., 1993; Jongepier et al., 1996; Langrock et al., 2003; Mar\u00edn et al., 2020). However, despite its extensive distribution across the SW Barents Shelf, the traditional Upper Jurassic source rock unit only appears to be mature in a narrow belt along the western margin of the Hammerfest Basin and on the margins of the Loppa High (Dore, 1995; Mar\u00edn et al., 2020). In the deeper marginal basins further to the west, the Upper Jurassic source rock unit has been buried very deeply and is over-mature (Ohm et al., 2008). Documenting the presence of alternative source rock units at stratigraphic shallower intervals is, therefore, crucial for exploration success in these frontier areas.\nSuch alternative source rock units may occur in the Lower Cretaceous and Paleogene successions (Leith et al., 1993; \u00d8ygard and Olsen, 2002; Seldal, 2005; Lerch et al., 2017; Sattar et al., 2017). Several exploration wells have confirmed the presence of Lower Cretaceous source rock units in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (e.g. 7321\/9\u20131) and in the western part of the Hammerfest Basin (e.g. 7120\/6-3 S) (NPD Factpages, 2021). Moreover, some petroleum discoveries have previously been linked to Lower Cretaceous source rocks by biomarkers (e.g. wells 7120\/10\u20131, 7120\/1\u20132, 7120\/2-3 S, 6706\/12\u20132, 6305\/8\u20131, and 6405\/7) (Lerch et al., 2017; NPD Factpages, 2021), and on the Mid-Norwegian Shelf are several oil discoveries identified as sourced by Cretaceous source rocks (Matapour and Karlsen, 2017). A regionally extensive, gas condensate-prone source rock unit of early Aptian age have been identified onshore Svalbard at the northwestern corner of the Barents Shelf (Midtkandal et al., 2016; Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2019). In addition, oil stains discovered in sandstones onshore northeastern Greenland indicate the presence of a Cretaceous-age source rock (Bojesen-Koefoed et al., 2020). However, there are large uncertainties related to the presence, stratigraphic position, and lateral distribution of Lower Cretaceous source rock units offshore, particularly in the deep basins along the western shelf margin. The regional significance of Lower Cretaceous source rocks is, therefore, still largely unclear (Dore, 1995; Mann et al., 2002; \u00d8ygard and Olsen, 2002; Seldal, 2005; Lerch et al., 2017). Thus, a detailed investigation of organic-rich units exhibiting source rock potential within the Lower Cretaceous succession seems essential in developing new play models and reducing exploration risk in the western frontier areas of the Barents Shelf.\nBy combining high-resolution regional 2D seismic data, well logs, and a digitalized Rock-Eval database, this study documents the lateral and stratigraphic distribution and variability of potential source rock units within the Lower Cretaceous succession on the southwestern Barents Shelf (Fig. 1\n). In particular, this study applies traditional source rock evaluation methods (sensu Peters and Cassa, 1994) to establish the potential and quality of the recognized potential source rock units in the shallow basins located on the interior platform part of the shelf (e.g. the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and Hammerfest Basin). This analysis will further aid in mapping the lateral and stratigraphic distribution of potential source rock units in the deeper marginal basins (e.g. the Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins). Finally, various factors that controlled the development and distribution of the investigated organic-rich intervals, such as the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the various basins, are evaluated and discussed.\n\n\n2\nGeological framework\n\n2.1\nStructural setting\nThe Barents Shelf is an epicontinental platform situated between the Norwegian mainland in the south, the Svalbard archipelago and Franz Josef Land to the north, and Novaya Zemlya to the east\/southeast (Fig. 1). Following the Caledonian orogeny in the Late Silurian \u2013 Early Devonian, the shelf has undergone multiple phases of extension and subordinate compression, which have resulted in a complex pattern of fault-bounded basins and highs, as well as platform areas and smaller inversion-related structures (Faleide et al., 1984, 1993a, 1993b, 2008; Riis et al., 2014). The main extensional, basin-forming phases occurred during i) the Late Devonian associated with the collapse of the Caledonian orogenic belt, ii) the Late Carboniferous, iii) the Late Permian \u2013 Early Triassic, iv) the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous, and v) finally during the complete opening of the NE Atlantic rift system during the Late Cretaceous \u2013 Early Paleogene (Faleide et al., 2008, 2015).\nThe most important basins for this study include: 1) the Fingerdjupet Subbasin; 2) the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin; 3) Hammerfest Basin; and 4) the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Fig. 1). In general, the evolution of these basins is related to the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous extensional event. A brief outline of their structural development is given below.\n\n2.1.1\nFingerdjupet Subbasin\nThe Fingerdjupet Subbasin is considered to be the shallow northeastern extension of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin. Its southern and western boundaries are defined by the Leirdjupet Fault Complex (LFC) (Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Faleide et al., 1993a), whereas the Bjarmeland Platform and the Loppa High defines its eastern and southeastern boundaries (Gabrielsen et al., 1990, Fig. 1). The Fingerdjupet Subbasin is characterized by a horst and graben configuration, with a series of faults that developed during Late Jurassic extension and local reactivation during the Early Cretaceous (Faleide et al., 1993b). This includes the Randi Fault Set (RFS), situated in the eastern transition to the Bjarmeland Platform (Serck et al., 2017). Furthermore, an Aptian extensional event is well documented in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Faleide et al., 1993a; Clark et al., 2014; Blaich et al., 2017; Serck et al., 2017). This fault activity initiated the formation of localized wedges and contributed to the uplift of the northern parts of Loppa High (Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017). Because of Cenozoic uplift and erosion (Henriksen et al., 2011; Lasabuda et al., 2018, 2021) only the lowermost part of the Lower Cretaceous succession is preserved in the basin.\n\n\n2.1.2\nBj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin\nThe NE\u2013SW-oriented Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin is bounded by the LFC to the east, by the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Complex (BFC) to the southeast, and by the faulted margin of the Stappen High to the northwest (Fig. 1), cf. Gabrielsen et al. (1990). Structuring of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin is also attributed to the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous extensional event (Faleide et al., 1993a, 1993b). Consequently, most of the basin infill is of Early Cretaceous age (Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Faleide et al., 1993a). The basin was affected by faulting and local inversion in association with the BFC and uplift of the Stappen High during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene (Faleide et al., 1993a).\n\n\n2.1.3\nHammerfest Basin\nThe Hammerfest Basin is an elongated ENE \u2013 WSW oriented basin, located south of the Loppa High (Fig. 1). The Ringvass\u00f8y-Loppa Fault Complex (RLFC) separates it from the deeper Troms\u00f8 Basin to the west, while the Asterias Fault complex (AFC) separates it from the Loppa High (Gabrielsen et al., 1990). Its southern border is defined by the Troms-Finnmark Fault Complex (TFFC), which separates the basin from the Finnmark Platform (Gabrielsen et al., 1990). Structuring of the Hammerfest Basin is mainly attributed to extension in Triassic and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times (Berglund et al., 1986; Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Faleide et al., 1993a). Local compression has also been documented (Sund, 1984; Gabrielsen et al., 1997; Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017). Uplift and doming along the central basin axis started in the Middle Jurassic (Berglund et al., 1986) and extended into the Early Cretaceous (Berglund et al., 1986; Faleide et al., 1993a). Consequently, new depocenters formed along the boundaries of the Hammerfest Basin (Mar\u00edn et al., 2017). The uplift ceased in the early Barremian (Faleide et al., 1993a), leaving most of the Barremian \u2013 Aptian succession confined within the faulted boundaries of the basin (Mar\u00edn et al., 2017, 2018b).\n\n\n2.1.4\nTroms\u00f8 Basin\nThe Troms\u00f8 Basin is an NNE \u2013 SSW-oriented basin that transitions southwards into the Harstad Basin, eventually terminating against the TFFC (Fig. 1). The BFC and the Veslem\u00f8y High define its northern boundary, separating it from the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin. The RLFC delineates the eastern boundary towards the Hammerfest Basin, while the Senja Ridge marks its western boundary (Gabrielsen et al., 1990). As the North Atlantic rift system advanced northward during the Middle Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous, deep basins formed along the southwestern Barents Shelf margin (Faleide et al., 1993a, 1993b). The Early Cretaceous extensional event in the Troms\u00f8 Basin was focused along the NE-SW trending RLFC and the BFC. Consequently, the Troms\u00f8 Basin experienced rapid subsidence, creating immense accommodation space for Cretaceous sediments, preserved as an up to ca. 8 km thick succession (R\u00f8nnevik et al., 1982; Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Faleide et al., 1993a, 2008; Clark et al., 2014; Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017; Kairanov et al., 2021). A total of three Early Cretaceous extensional phases have been documented for the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Berriasian \u2013 Valanginian, Hauterivian \u2013 Barremian and Aptian \u2013 Albian) (Faleide et al., 1993a; Kairanov et al., 2021). In addition, Late Palaeozoic salt deposits were mobilized by rapid subsidence and differential loading during Albian times, triggering diapirism in the central parts of the basin (Kairanov et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n2.2\nLower Cretaceous stratigraphy and depositional systems\nThe Lower Cretaceous succession on the Barents Shelf is divided into the Knurr (Berriasian \u2013 Early Barremian), Klippfisk (Late Berriasian \u2013 Hauterivian), Kolje (Barremian \u2013 Early Aptian) and Kolmule (Aptian \u2013 Cenomanian) Formations (Fig. 2\n), collectively assigned to the Adventdalen Group (Parker, 1967; Dalland et al., 1988). Because there are some age-related uncertainties in correlating these units across the various basins, the Lower Cretaceous succession was recently subdivided into seven genetic sequences (S0 \u2013 S6; Fig. 2) bounded by regionally extensive flooding surfaces (Mar\u00edn et al., 2017). Sequences S0 and S1 corresponds to the Knurr and Klippfisk formations, whereas sequence S2 correspond roughly to the Kolje Formation, and sequences S3 to S6 represents the Kolmule Formation (Mar\u00edn et al., 2017, Fig. 2).\nOn the SW Barents Shelf, the Lower Cretaceous succession was generally deposited in open marine shelf environments, affected by periods of restricted bottom circulation (Dalland et al., 1988). The dominant lithology of the succession is grey-brown mudstones with interbeds of siltstone, limestone, and local sandstones (e.g. Worsley et al., 1988; Bugge et al., 2002; Seldal, 2005). The up to 285 m thick (as measured in well 7120\/12\u20131) mudstone-dominated Knurr Formation (Valanginian\u2013early Barremian), and the laterally equivalent carbonate-dominated Klippfisk Formation (Valanginian\u2013Hauterivian) on the eastern platform areas constitute the lowermost part of the Lower Cretaceous succession (Dalland et al., 1988; Smelror et al., 1998). These are both condensed units containing multiple stratigraphic gaps (Smelror et al., 2009). Sandstone units emplaced by gravity-flow process occur locally near structural highs (Seldal, 2005; Sattar et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2018a).\nThe up to 437 m thick (as measured in well 7119\/12\u20131) mudstone-dominated Kolje Formation (Barremian \u2013 earliest Aptian) was deposited in a shelf setting under generally well-oxygenated, open marine conditions (Dalland et al., 1988). A large-scale delta system prograding from the NW, reached the Fingerdjupet Subbasin in Barremian \u2013 Aptian times, as evident by the presence of several clinoform-bearing sequences in the upper part of the Barremian succession (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017; Midtkandal et al., 2019). A regionally extensive flooding surface, which caps the clinoforms, separates the Kolje Formation from the overlying Kolmule Formation (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2017; Serck et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2018b).\nThe up to 950 m thick (as measured in well 7119\/12\u20131) mudstone-rich and sandstone-bearing Kolmule Formation (Aptian\u2013Middle Cenomanian) was deposited in response to significant uplift of the northeastern Barents Shelf, particularly during the Albian. Large amounts of sediments were shed off uplifted terranes and transported towards the rapidly subsiding basins along the southwestern shelf margin, such as the Harstad, Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins (Faleide et al., 1993a, 1993b; Smelror et al., 2009). Consequently, a large delta system prograded from the E to NE onto the SW Barents Shelf in the Aptian \u2013 Cenomanian (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017; Midtkandal et al., 2019). At these times, the shelf was generally characterized by well-oxygenated, open marine conditions (Smelror et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nSeismic data\nThis study includes several high-resolution regional 2D seismic surveys (NBR, 2006\u20132012). The different orientation and spacing (1\u20138 km) of the 2D lines make up a grid that spans the study area, thus forming a regional pseudo 3D-grid. The acquisition of these surveys took place over a period of several years, resulting in varying quality between the surveys. In general, frequencies are in the range of 10\u201350 Hz, while the polarity convention for the dataset is zero-phase normal polarity, following the nomenclature of Sheriff (2002). The description of reflection configurations and seismic geometries follow the terminology established by Mitchum et al. (1977).\nConfidence of the seismic interpretations within the deeper basins is strongly affected by a decreasing seismic quality with depth. In addition, no well data were available for either the central parts of the Troms\u00f8 or the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins.\n\n3.1.1\nSeismic response to organic-rich intervals and mapping of potential source rock units\nMudrocks with total organic carbon (TOC) contents >3 \u2013 4% typically have significantly lower acoustic impedance and higher intrinsic anisotropy than mudrocks with lower amounts of organic content. The general density of kerogen is typical in the range of 1.1\u20131.4 g\/cm3, while mudrocks generally have a density of 2.7 g\/cm3 (L\u00f8seth et al., 2011; Rider and Kennedy, 2011). Organic matter will, therefore, influence the seismic response trough compressional velocity (Vp), shear velocity (Vs), bulk density, anisotropy, and attenuation (L\u00f8seth et al., 2011). A potential source rock unit may thus result in a high amplitude reflection characterized by a negative top and a positive base (L\u00f8seth et al., 2011). Furthermore, the acoustic impedance contrast is relatively stable down to a depth of c. 4500 m and decreases nonlinearly with increasing TOC content (L\u00f8seth et al., 2011). This has clear implications for the Lower Cretaceous succession, which is buried at depths down to 5\u20137 s two-way-travel time, in the deep Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Troms\u00f8 basins (Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Kairanov et al., 2021).\nThe seismic mapping thus specifically targets the top of potential source rock units as these are displayed as negative high-amplitude anomalies in the data. Biostratigraphic age determination of the mapped reflectors are guided by well tops from the publicly available database of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD Factpages, 2021) and from in-house data provided by Wintershall-Dea Norway. In the deep Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins, well 7219\/8-1 S is a key reference point in providing age-control of the Lower Cretaceous succession. In most cases, the targeted reflectors seem to correspond to regionally extensive maximum flooding surfaces documented by previous studies (e.g. Mar\u00edn et al., 2017). Thus, for regional stratigraphic context, the genetic sequence subdivision of Mar\u00edn et al. (2017, 2018a, 2018b), and partly that of Serck et al. (2017), is used for guidance in the Hammerfest Basin and Fingerdjupet Subbasin, respectively (with some minor modifications). In the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the stratigraphic subdivision builds largely on that of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin by correlating the seismic horizons across the LFC and TFC (Fig. 1). In the Troms\u00f8 Basin, the stratigraphic framework used in this study, builds largely on the recent work of Kairanov et al. (2021), and by linking it to the stratigraphic framework established by Mar\u00edn et al. (2017) for the Hammerfest Basin.\nTo investigate lateral variability and distribution of potential source rock units, average negative amplitude maps have been generated for two of the high-amplitude reflectors following the workflow of L\u00f8seth et al. (2011). The negative amplitude map is not very reliable in the deep basins because of deteriorating seismic quality and reflector dimming, making a lateral correlation from the shallow basins a difficult and time-consuming task. Consequently, amplitude maps have only been generated for two of the mapped reflectors. The generation of the amplitude map uses a search window of 5 ms above and 20 ms below the interpretation of the reflector.\n\n\n\n3.2\nWell data\nSeventeen exploration wells have been selected and investigated for this study (Fig. 1 and Table 1\n). All the wells have an established time-depth relationship trough calibration of check shots. Most of the wells exhibit a common suite of wireline-logs including gamma ray (GR), sonic (AC\/DT), density (DEN), and deep resistivity (RDEP). Wireline logs are generally regarded to be a good supplement to seismic data when evaluating the presence of potential source rock units, Thus, to confirm the presence of potential source rock units mapped in the seismic data, wireline log signals are integrated with digitalized TOC logs derived from the Rock-Eval data. The thicknesses of the potential source rock units are estimated from the wireline data and subsequently, TOC samples within the interval, or from stratigraphically nearby intervals, are evaluated (Table 1). The typical wireline response to organic rich units is briefly outlined below.\n\n3.2.1\nWireline responses to organic-rich units\n\n3.2.1.1\nGamma ray log (GR)\nOrganic-rich mudrocks commonly show high GR values because of elevated concentrations of uranium. However, this is not always the case as uranium can be a highly mobile element under the right conditions (Bowker and Grace, 2010; Helleren et al., 2020). In addition, the GR-signal may be subject to various interference from the well casing.\n\n\n3.2.1.2\nSonic log (AC\/DT)\nThe presence of organic matter in mudrocks will lower the sonic travel time (Rider and Kennedy, 2011). This response is evidently more apparent in mature source rocks. However, using the sonic log independently to identify organic rich intervals is problematic, because it is impossible to separate low sonic values caused by the presence of organic matter from low sonic values caused by porosity changes (Rider and Kennedy, 2011).\n\n\n3.2.1.3\nResistivity log (RDEP)\nThe resistivity logs response to a source rock depends on the maturity of the organic matter (Rider and Kennedy, 2011). In immature organic matter, the response will be small due to high conductivity. In mature source rocks where, free petroleum are present in voids and fractures, the resistivity will increase significantly (Rider and Kennedy, 2011).\n\n\n3.2.1.4\nDensity log (DEN)\nMudrocks containing low amounts of organic matter have a higher density matrix (2.67 \u2013 2.72 g\/cm3) compared to pure organic matter (1.1 \u2013 1.2 g\/cm3). The density log will consequently read lower values in organic rich mudrocks (Rider and Kennedy, 2011). The presence of organic matter thus has a distinct effect on the overall mudrock density, which also shifts the acoustic impedance in the seismic data towards negative amplitudes (L\u00f8seth et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nRock-Eval data\nIn order to establish the richness, type, and thermal maturity of the source rock units identified in the seismic and wireline data, traditional source rock evaluation following the principles of Espitali\u00e9 et al. (1977), Peters (1986) and Peters and Cassa (1994) are used. The Rock-Eval data presented here are based on samples derived from either sidewall cores or drill cuttings from the 17 wells. The sample spacing varies between each well (ranging from samples collected every 2\u2013100 m; see Table 1 for sampling interval details), which consequently makes it difficult to achieve a good representation of thin source rock units occurring between the sampled intervals. In these cases, the nearest samples to the interval have been used where applicable. To establish the thermal maturity of the potential source rock units, emphasis has been given to Tmax values as these are numerous throughout the dataset, while the scarce vitrinite reflectance (Ro) data supplement the interpretation when applicable.\nThe Rock-Eval database has been digitalized and implemented into Petrel for each corresponding well. This makes it possible for a direct correlation between the source rock reflections and the Rock-Eval data at any of the well locations. The complete Rock-Eval database, including TOC content, is given in the online supplementary file SF1.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSeismic sequences and bounding surfaces\nSeven genetic sequences (S0 \u2013 S6) and their bounding surfaces (i.e., the BCU, iuH, iB, ilA, ilAl, iuAl, IuCn reflectors of this study, see detailed descriptions below) are recognized within the Lower Cretaceous succession in the study area (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n), conforming to the well-established sequence stratigraphic framework of Mar\u00edn et al. (2017, 2018a, 2018b). Thus, apart from the Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU), which defines the base of the Lower Cretaceous succession, the sequence-bounding surfaces represent regionally extensive maximum flooding surfaces that may be correlated from the Hammerfest Basin and the Fingerdjupet Subbasin westward into the Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins (Figs. 3 and 4; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017). Bellow follows a seismic description of the genetic sequences and their bounding surfaces.\n\n4.1.1\nSequence 0 (Berriasian \u2013 Hauterivian)\nSequence 0 is bounded at the base by the regionally extensive BCU, and atop by the intra upper Hauterivian reflector (iuH). The BCU appears as a high amplitude reflector. The iuH reflector has a negative amplitude with variable magnitude and continuity. In the shallow Fingerdjupet Subbasin and the Hammerfest Basin, sequence 0 has a subparallel to divergent reflection configuration with good continuity and strong amplitudes (Figs. 3 and 4). The sequence has a wedge-shaped geometry, were there is a distinct thickness increase towards the main depocenters. In the deeper Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Troms\u00f8 basins, the reflectors are typically subparallel and discontinuous with low amplitude.\n\n\n4.1.2\nSequence 1 (Hauterivian \u2013 Early Barremian)\nSequence 1 is bounded at the base by the iuH reflector, and atop by the intra Barremian reflector (iB). The iB reflector has a medium negative amplitude with relatively good continuity. The sequence is present in the shallow Hammerfest Basin and Fingerdjupet Subbasin, as well as in the deep Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins, though exhibiting varying thickness and seismic characteristics. In the shallow basins, reflectors are usually parallel to subparallel with strong amplitudes and good continuity. The sequence has a sheet and wedge geometry, where thickness variations are controlled by normal faults. In the Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins, reflectors are subparallel and discontinuous with low amplitude.\n\n\n4.1.3\nSequence 2 (Barremian \u2013 Early Aptian)\nSequence 2 is bounded at the base by the iB reflector and above by the intra lower Aptian reflector (ilA; Fig. 2). Reflectors within sequence 2 are subparallel and continuous with medium amplitude in the Hammerfest Basin. In the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, the sequence is represented by sigmoidal clinoforms with medium to high amplitudes. In the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Troms\u00f8 basins, reflectors have a subparallel to divergent configuration, where wedges are located close to the fault complexes (e.g. LFC, BFC and RLFC). These reflectors have low \u2013 medium amplitude and are discontinuous towards the deeper basin segments.\n\n\n4.1.4\nSequence 3 (Aptian \u2013 Early Albian)\nSequence 3 is bounded at the base by the ilA and atop by the intra lower Albian reflector (ilAl). Reflectors within the sequence are subparallel to chaotic and amplitudes are generally low to medium. In places, the sequence has a wedge-shaped geometry, typically thickening towards basin bounding faults, but generally have a sheet-like geometry in the deep basins. No visible negative high-amplitude anomalies have been detected within this sequence.\n\n\n4.1.5\nSequence 4 (Early Albian \u2013 Late Albian)\nSequence 4 is bounded at the base by the ilAl reflector and atop by the intra upper Albian (iuAl) reflector. Reflector configurations range from continuous and parallel to chaotic in the shallow basins, while they are typically subparallel in the deeper basins. The amplitudes are often medium to low. The external geometry of the sequence has sheet to sheet drape external form.\n\n\n4.1.6\nSequence 5 and 6 (Late Albian \u2013 Cenomanian)\nSequence 5 and 6 are grouped together due to similarities in internal seismic characteristics and the internal lack of extensive and significant negative high-amplitude anomalies. Note however, that these sequences are seismically distinguishable from each other as demonstrated by previous workers (e.g. Mar\u00edn et al., 2017, Figs. 3 and 4). The composite sequence 5 and 6 are bounded at the base by the iuAl reflector and atop by the intra upper Cenomanian reflector (iuCn). The sequences and their corresponding lower and upper bounding surfaces are widespread in the Hammerfest and Troms\u00f8 basins and partly in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin but are missing\/eroded in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 3). Internally, the reflectors of sequences 5 and 6 are typically parallel to subparallel continuous, with medium amplitude. These sequences generally have a \u2018basin-infill\u2019 geometry, where the greatest thicknesses occur in the deepest parts of the respective basins.\n\n\n\n4.2\nPotential Lower Cretaceous source rock units\nFour negative high-amplitude reflectors have been recognized and mapped in detail within the study area. These are the: i) intra upper Hauterivian (iuH; corresponding to flooding surface K0 of Mar\u00edn et al., 2017), ii) intra Barremian (iB; corresponding to flooding surface K1 of Mar\u00edn et al., 2017), iii) intra lower Aptian (ilA; corresponding to flooding surface K2 of Mar\u00edn et al., 2017), and the intra upper Cenomanian (iuCn; corresponding to flooding surface K6 of Mar\u00edn et al., 2017) reflectors. Each of these reflectors correlate to certain wireline signals in the wells and raised TOC contents, which are typically associated with the presence of organic-rich units. The seismic expression, occurrence, typical wireline signal and TOC range of these units are summarized in Table 2\n with a detailed description of each reflector\/organic-rich unit given below.\n\n4.2.1\nIntra upper Hauterivian (iuH) reflector\n\nFig. 5\nA shows the stratigraphic framework for the central basin in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and the transition to the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin over the Ringsel Ridge. In addition, a composite seismic profile trough wells 7321\/7\u20131, 7321\/8\u20131 and 7321\/9-1 shows the interaction between well, reflector and structural setting in Fig. 5B. The iuH reflector is present across the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and can be traced laterally towards the Bjarmeland Platform (Fig. 5B). The reflector is characterized by continuous low \u2013 medium amplitudes, with the strongest amplitudes recorded in the central parts of the basin (see iuH; Fig. 5A). Wells 7321\/7\u20131, 7321\/8\u20131 and 7321\/9\u20131 penetrate the iuH reflector in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 5B). However, the unit corresponding to the reflector has no significant TOC values or wireline signals that would indicate a viable source rock for the area (see iuH; Fig. 6\n).\nThe iuH reflector can be traced from the Fingerdjupet Subbasin over the Ringsel Ridge into the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin (Fig. 5A). In the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the iuH reflector has a lower amplitude compared to Fingerdjupet Subbasin. However, the reflector remains continuous and can be traced southwards parallel to the BFC. Moving east, towards the deeper parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the reflector dims to a discontinuous low amplitude reflector. In the southern parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the iuH reflector is penetrated by well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 7\n). Here, the reflector marks the top of a potential source rock unit ranging from 3620 to 3670 m (Figs. 7 and 8\n). The unit has relatively good TOC content but there is a lack of wireline response to the TOC values (Table 2 and Fig. 8).\nIn the Hammerfest Basin, the iuH reflector is widely distributed, but onlaps towards the uplifted central high (Fig. 9\n). The reflector has a medium amplitude with good continuity in the NW corner of the basin but increase in amplitude towards the uplifted central high (see iuH; Fig. 9). In the transition to the Troms\u00f8 Basin, the reflector dims but remains continuous until the reflector extends past the RLFC. In wells 7120\/8\u20133, 7120\/6-3 S, and 7119\/9\u20131 the unit corresponding to the iuH reflector have an average thickness of 17 m, and record increased TOC contents (Table 1 and Fig. 10\n) The wireline logs show a response to the increased TOC values with a drop in DEN values, and increase in both RDEP and AC values (e.g. iuH reflector in well 7120\/6-3 S; Fig. 10).\nFurther towards the west, the iuH reflector is downfaulted along the RLFC into the deeper Troms\u00f8 Basin. The reflector quickly loses its seismic characteristics due to deeper burial but can be traced along the NE margin of the Troms\u00f8 Basin. At this location, the iuH reflector is discontinuous and characterized by low amplitudes. However, towards the deeper parts of the Troms\u00f8 Basin, the reflector is too obscure to be traced with confidence due to the large burial depth and the poorer-quality seismic signal. In addition, there are no well data available from the deep basin.\nBased on the seismic amplitudes, the wireline signals, and the elevated TOC contents, the iuH reflector is interpreted to represent a potential upper Hauterivian source rock unit in the Hammerfest Basin. The iuH reflector thus marks the top of this unit in well 7120\/8\u20133, 7120\/6-3 S, 7119\/9\u20131 and 7120\/9\u20132, which have a clear GR-log trend with associated high TOC values (Fig. 10). Data from well 7120\/6-3 S record high TOC values close to the Loppa High and the AFC. However, at this location the amplitude is lower than on the central high. In addition, well 7120\/8\u20133, 7119\/9\u20131 and 7120\/9\u20132 indicate that the organic-rich unit may hold potential in the central parts of the basin. This could indicate that the organic-rich unit is more widely distributed in the Hammerfest Basin, not only occurring in localized depocenters near the Loppa High and the Finnmark Platform.\nDespite a small increase in TOC in well 7321\/7\u20131, the low amplitude of the reflector coupled with the unfavorable wireline signals and the generally low TOC values, indicate that there is no potential associated with iuH reflector in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. In the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the iuH reflector has a low \u2013 medium amplitude associated with the unit in well 7219\/8-1 S. This 50 m thick unit has relatively high TOC values. However, the low RDEP values show little to no response to possible liquid petroleum in the unit.\n\n\n4.2.2\nIntra Barremian (iB) reflector\nThe iB reflector is extending across the entire Fingerdjupet Subbasin as a continuous, but low amplitude negative reflector (Fig. 5A). The reflector is penetrated by three wells in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and may be correlated to a unit which record a relatively small increase in TOC contents (Fig. 5B; Table 2). However, the TOC levels are relatively low and wireline logs indicate there is no significant response to the slightly increased TOC values (see iB reflector; Fig. 6). From the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, the iB reflector can be traced to the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin over the Ringsel Ridge (Fig. 5A) and further south, parallel along the LFC and BFC. The reflector is generally discontinuous and characterized by a low amplitude close to these fault complexes. Towards the deeper parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the reflector dims significantly and becomes difficult to interpret. The iB reflector intersects well 7218\/8-1 S in the southern parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, where the reflector marks the top of an up to 250 m thick unit with elevated GR and moderate TOC values (Table 2 and Fig. 8).\nThe iB reflector is distributed over the entire western margin of the Hammerfest Basin. The reflector is continuous, has low \u2013 high amplitude characteristics, and interacts with all the wells in the area. However, the reflector has its strongest amplitudes in the NW corner of the Hammerfest Basin, and the reflector dims towards the uplifted central high (Fig. 9). Hence, the nearby wells 7120\/6-3 S and 7120\/5\u20131 are regarded as key wells for the iB reflector (Table 2). Furthermore, in well 7120\/6-3 S the reflector marks the top of a 48 m tick unit, where the highest TOC values are in the uppermost section of the unit (Table 2; Figs. 9 and 10). Laterally, the TOC content in this unit decrease, demonstrated by well 7120\/8-3 situated on the central high and well 7119\/9-1 located towards the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Fig. 10). At the western transition towards the Troms\u00f8 Basin, the reflector is downfaulted along the RLFC and becomes impossible to trace in the deeper basin segments. However, the reflector is traced close to the RLFC in the NE parts of the Troms\u00f8 Basin. At this location, the reflector is discontinuous and has a low amplitude. There are no wells in the Troms\u00f8 Basin that may provide age-control or wireline data.\nBased on the wireline logs, TOC values and amplitude characteristics the iB reflector may represent a potential intra Barremian source rock unit in the NW part of the Hammerfest Basin (i.e. wells 7120\/6-3 S and 7120\/5\u20131). The negative amplitude of the reflector increases in magnitude towards the Loppa High and the AFC, this might indicate an increased potential. Laterally, the extensive reflector is penetrated by all the wells on the western margin of the Hammerfest Basin, but the TOC contents and wireline values measured in the corresponding unit do not indicate widespread potential. In the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, the iB reflector is of low amplitude and the TOC content is low in wells 7321\/7\u20131, 7321\/8\u20131 and 7321\/9\u20131. In addition, there is no response in the RDEP or GR log. Hence, there is no evidence for an intra Barremian source rock unit in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. In the adjacent Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the iB reflector marks the top of a unit exhibiting increased GR values in well 7219\/8-1 S. However, there are no increases in the TOC values nor do the wireline logs indicate that there is any source rock potential.\n\n\n4.2.3\nIntra lower Aptian (ilA) reflector\nThe ilA reflector is widespread in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin but is eroded on the local highs (i.e. well 7312\/8\u20131; Fig. 5B). Amplitude characteristics varies laterally, but the reflector has a distinct negative amplitude in the central basin and the southern parts of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 5A). These negative high amplitudes are illustrated in the negative amplitude map, which show the lateral extent and magnitude of the negative ilA reflector in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin (Fig. 11\nA). Smaller bright-spots are also sporadically present north of well 7321\/9\u20131 and towards the eastern margin of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 11A). Distribution of these high amplitudes are delimited by local highs controlled by the TFC, LFC and RFS (Figs. 5A\u201311A).\nThe ilA reflector is eroded in well 7321\/8-1 but it intersects wells 7321\/7\u20131 and 7321\/9\u20131 (Fig. 5B). In well 7321\/7\u20131, there is little indication of a potential source rock unit as the c. 50 m thick unit have low TOC and GR values (Fig. 6). In addition, the RDEP and AC logs do not display any elevated values (Fig. 6). In well 7321\/9\u20131, the ilA reflector marks the top of a 24 m thick unit (levels 961\u2013985 m; Fig. 6), which internally contains five sections of high GR-values and elevated TOC contents (Fig. 6) In addition, the DEN values drop and there is a significant increase in RDEP values (Table 2 and Fig. 6).\nThe ilA reflector is also mapped in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin. The strongest negative amplitudes are in the NE part of the basin, dimming southwards (Fig. 11A). However, it is still possible to trace it parallel to the LFC and BFC towards well 7219\/8-1 S, where the reflector has good continuity and a medium amplitude (Fig. 11A). The reflector is also extending laterally towards the deeper parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, where the reflector dims into a low amplitude reflector of poor continuity (Fig. 11A). Well 7218\/8-1 S penetrates the ilA reflector and a 159 m thick unit (Table 1). The unit has a clear increase in TOC values and wireline logs show a small response to the increased TOC values (Table 2 and Fig. 8).\nThe ilA reflector has a basin-wide distribution in the Hammerfest Basin and typically has a medium to high amplitude with good continuity (Figs. 9\u201311B). High amplitude patches are sporadically distributed, with some confined to NW part close to the AFC (Fig. 11B). These high amplitude patches are located some distance away from key wells such as 7120\/6-3 S and 7119\/9\u20131 (Fig. 11B) but interact with others (e.g. 7120\/7\u20133).\nThe ilA reflector marks the top of increased TOC values in multiple wells in the Hammerfest Basin (e.g. 7120\/6-3 S, 7120\/7\u20133 and 7119\/9\u20131; Figs. 9 and 10). The thickness of these units varies between each well (Table 1) and common for these units is the lack of wireline response to the elevated TOC values (Table 2). When traced laterally across the RLFC, the ilA reflector changes into a low amplitude reflector with poor continuity, which persists across major parts of the Troms\u00f8 Basin. (Fig. 11B). The reflector has medium amplitudes with good continuity in the NE part of the basin (Fig. 11B). Here, the reflector is located at depth of c. 5500 ms, implying that any organic matter has most likely reached very high maturity. In addition, there are no wells in the Troms\u00f8 Basin that penetrate the ilA reflector to confirm its potential.\nBased on wireline logs, increased TOC values and amplitude characteristics, the ilA reflector is interpreted to represent a potential source rock unit in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. The potential may extend from well 7321\/9\u20131 towards the deeper parts of the basin in the southern and central parts of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. In addition, bright spots recorded within the RFS north of well 7321\/9\u20131 may indicate some potential. The reflector also shows favorable amplitude characteristics in the NE part of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, in proximity to the LFC and the Ringsel Ridge.\nIndication of a viable source rock unit is also documented in the Hammerfest Basin. Although there are several wells recording elevated TOC contents, there are no other favorable indications in the wireline data (e.g. well 7120\/6-3 S, 7120\/7\u20133 and 7119\/9\u20131). However, the negative amplitude map suggests sporadically distributed bright spots that may indicate an increased potential in the NW part of the basin (i.e., near the AFC). In the NE margin of the Troms\u00f8 Basin, the ilA reflector has increased amplitude compared to in the rest of the basin. However, it is positioned at a depth of c. 5500 ms, which implies that any organic matter most likely has reached very high maturity.\n\n\n4.2.4\nIntra upper Cenomanian (iuCn) reflector\nThe iuCn reflector is only present in the deeper parts of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin as it is eroded in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and across the Stappen High. (Fig. 12\nA). The iuCn reflector is continuous with low \u2013 medium amplitudes, which increases to medium \u2013 high further south in the basin towards well 7219\/8-1 S (Figs. 7\u201312A). Elongated high amplitude anomalies are also present in this area (Fig. 12A). The reflector terminates against the BFC on the western margin of the Loppa High but extends across the Veslem\u00f8y High to the west of well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 12A). In well 7219\/8-1 S, the corresponding 43 m thick unit records a small increase in TOC values (Table 2). However, the wireline logs indicate that there is no significant response to the TOC content (Fig. 8).\nThe iuCn reflector is present along the entire western segment of the Hammerfest Basin, delimited by the Loppa High and the Finnmark Platform (Fig. 12B). The reflector is continuous and has a medium \u2013 high amplitude, where local high amplitudes occur along the western margin of the basin and towards the Loppa High (Fig. 12B). High amplitude patches are located around key wells such as well 7120\/6-3 S near the Loppa High, and well 7120\/7\u20133 towards the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Fig. 12B). The iuCn reflector is penetrated by all the wells in the western Hammerfest Basin, but common for these wells is that there is no indication of elevated TOC values associated with this event.\nThe iuCn reflector is traced from the Hammerfest basin across the RLFC into the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Fig. 13\nA). Here, the amplitude characteristics changes to a lower amplitude, but remains continuous. The reflector extends laterally throughout the basin and the negative amplitude map shows that strong negative amplitudes are present in the central parts and along the basin edges (Fig. 12B). NNE \u2013 SSW-oriented, elongated amplitude anomalies are also present across the basin (Fig. 12B).\nWell 7218\/11\u20131 is one of few wells that penetrates the iuCn reflector in the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Fig. 13A and B). From the seismic data, it is clear that this well is positioned in a half-graben setting near the basin margin (Fig. 13B). At this location, the iuCn reflector has a low \u2013 medium amplitude (Fig. 13B). The corresponding 121 m thick unit in the well has elevated TOC values, but wireline logs indicate that there is little to no response to the increased organic matter beneath the iuCn reflector (Table 2 and Fig. 8).\nAlthough the iuCn reflector is penetrated by key wells in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya, Hammerfest and Troms\u00f8 basins, there are no TOC values or wireline signals that convincingly demonstrate the presence of a potential upper Cenomanian source rock unit. However, there are some elevated TOC values in well 7218\/11\u20131. The general lack of response in the wireline logs may indicate that the concentration of organic matter is too low to produce a signal characteristic for prolific source rock units.\n\n\n\n4.3\nSource rock evaluation of the organic-rich units\nBased on the mapping of the four high-amplitude negative reflectors in the seismic data (i.e. the iuH, IB, ilA, and iuCn reflectors; Table 2) combined with analyses of the wireline and TOC data, four organic-rich units representing potential source rock units are suggested. These includes: 1) upper Hauterivian, 2) Barremian, 3) lower Aptian, and 4) upper Cenomanian units. These potential source rock units occur atop of sequences 0, 1, 2 and 6, respectively (Fig. 2). Source rock characteristics based on the available Rock-Eval data (see Table 1 for sample interval, and the online supplementary file SF1 for the raw data) are given for each of these potential source rock units. The main characteristics of the units with highest potential are summarized in Table 3\n.\n\n4.3.1\nCharacteristics of the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit\nThe characteristics of the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit is shown in Fig. 14\n. In general, most of the analyzed samples have poor potential indicated by low S2 values (S2 < 2.5 mg\/g) and variable TOC content (1.0\u20135.7 wt %; Fig. 14A). They also have low HI (50\u2013150 mg HC\/g TOC; Fig. 14B) and OI values (1\u201375 CO2\/g TOC; Fig. 14C). Furthermore, the same samples appear to be mature with Tmax values of 430\u2013460 \u00b0C (Fig. 14B) and near the vitrinite reflectance trend line 0.88% (Fig. 14B). Collectively, the majority of the samples indicate that kerogen Type III dominates the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit and that gas is the main expelled product (Fig. 14C).\nA few sample points deviate from the general trend of the organic-rich unit and may reflect more localized potential. This includes samples from wells 7120\/8\u20133, 7120\/6-3 S and 7120\/9\u20132, which all show higher potential (Table 3 and Fig. 14A). However, these units are relatively thin and contain few sample points (Table 1). Well 7120\/6-3 S contains the most prolific sample of the Hauterivian organic-rich unit. These samples have higher HI values and plots within the kerogen Type II field (Fig. 14C). No vitrinite reflectance data is available for well 7120\/6-3 S.\n\n\n4.3.2\nCharacteristics of the Barremian organic-rich unit\n\nFig. 15\n shows the source rock evaluation of the samples from the Barremian organic-rich unit. The general trend shows that most of the samples have a poor potential indicated by low S2 values (S2 < 2.5 mg\/g) and a variable TOC content (1.13\u20134.88 wt %; Fig. 15A). In addition, most of the samples have low HI values (50\u2013150 mg HC\/g TOC) and Tmax values of 430\u2013470 \u00b0C (Fig. 15B). The samples also have low OI values (1\u2013100 CO2\/g TOC; Fig. 15C). In total, most of the data indicate a mature (Fig. 15B) kerogen Type III dominated (Fig. 15C) organic-rich unit, with poor potential (Fig. 15A).\nThe source potential of the Barremian organic-rich unit seems to be very localized demonstrated by samples in wells 7120\/6-3 S and 7120\/5\u20131, as these stand out as the most prolific ones (Table 3 and Fig. 15A). The most prolific sample is taken from well 7120\/6-3 S and has a S2 value of 19.82 mg\/g and TOC values of 4.88 wt% (Fig. 15A). In general, samples in well 7120\/6-3 S exhibit higher hydrogen content (Table 3 and Fig. 15B). In addition, Tmax values are on average 440 \u00b0C, while the vitrinite reflectance (Ro) ranges between 0.6 and 0.88% (Fig. 15B). Collectively, the Barremian organic-rich unit in well 7120\/6-3 S has excellent potential with a kerogen Type II composition and is further classified as an early mature to mature oil prone source rock unit.\n\n\n4.3.3\nCharacteristics of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit\nThe source rock evaluation on the samples from the lower Aptian organic-rich unit is shown in Fig. 16\n. Most of the samples are plotting in the poor potential area with low S2 values (S2 < 2.5 mg\/g) and generally low TOC content (1.5\u20133 wt %; Fig. 16A). These samples have HI values close to 100 mg HC\/g TOC and are plotting around Tmax values of 440 \u00b0C to the right of the Ro = 0.6 vitrinite reflectance trend line (Fig. 16B). The same cluster also has variable OI values (1\u2013100 CO2\/g TOC) coupled with low HI values (Fig. 16C). Collectively, this indicate that most of the lower Aptian organic-rich samples have a kerogen Type III composition where the expected product would be gas.\nA few samples from wells 7321\/9\u20131, 7219\/8-1 S, and 7120\/7-3 deviate from the general trend and indicate a localized higher potential (Table 3 and Fig. 16A). The most prolific samples for the lower Aptian organic-rich unit are from well 7321\/9\u20131 and have a kerogen Type II composition (Table 3; Fig. 16A and B) No vitrinite reflectance data are available for this source rock unit but based on Tmax values and the vitrinite reflectance Ro = 0.6 trend line, the organic-rich unit is early mature (Fig. 16B). The organic-rich unit has also low OI values and high HI values, implying that the organic-rich unit is high quality and that the main expelled product is oil (Fig. 16C).\nMultiple samples from the organic-rich unit in well 7219\/8-1 S and 7120\/7\u20133 also indicate elevated potential (Table 3). However, this unit has significantly lower HI values compared to well 7321\/9\u20131 and has a kerogen Type III composition (Fig. 16A and B). The exceptional high Tmax values in well 7219\/8-1 S plot to the right of the Ro = 0.88% vitrinite reflectance trend line, indicating that the organic-rich unit is mature at this locality (Fig. 16B). Furthermore, based on the OI and HI values the main expelled product is gas from the organic-rich unit in well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 16C). In contrast, the samples in well 7120\/7-3 plots to the left of the Ro = 0.88 vitrinite reflectance trend line (Fig. 16B) and within the oil window (Fig. 16C).\n\n\n4.3.4\nCharacteristics of the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit\nThe source rock evaluation performed on the samples from the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit is displayed in Fig. 17\n. Apart from samples in well 7218\/11\u20131, most of the samples show a unimodal distribution with very poor potential, indicated by low S2 (S2 < 2.5 mg\/g) and TOC values (0.83\u20131.49 wt %; Fig. 17A). These samples also have low HI values (20\u2013110 mg HC\/g TOC) and variable Tmax values (422\u2013435 \u00b0C; Fig. 17B). This indicates that the small amount of organic matter is most likely of kerogen Type IV\u2013III composition (Fig. 17A and B) and that the main product is gas (Fig. 17C).\nThe exception is well 7218\/11\u20131 which overall shows a better potential with substantially higher TOC and S2 values (Table 3 and Fig. 17A). Samples from 7218\/11\u20131 also have higher HI values and slightly lower Tmax values compared to the low potential samples (Table 3 and Fig. 17B). Hence, these samples plot left of the vitrinite reflectance trend line Ro = 0.6 (Fig. 17B). In addition, three samples of vitrinite reflectance are available for the unit. These samples have little spread and have an average Ro value of 0.3%. In total, this classifies the organic matter in well 7218\/11\u20131 as a kerogen Type II-III (Fig. 17C) where the main expelled product is oil (Fig. 17C). However, based on the Tmax values and the vitrinite reflectance samples, the organic-rich unit is classified as immature at the well location.\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nThe presence of four organic-rich units of variable source rock potential has been documented within the Lower Cretaceous succession on the SW Barents Shelf, these are the: (1) upper Hauterivian (2) Barremian, (3) lower Aptian, and (4) upper Cenomanian organic-rich units (Table 3). These units have different characteristics which result in varying potential across the region. This may reflect variations in depositional environments and oxygen levels, organic productivity, and preservation potential governed by amongst other factors such as sedimentation rate, basin configurations and hydrodynamic conditions.\nDuring the Early Cretaceous, active rifting in the SW Barents Sea resulted in a typical rift configuration with fault-bounded basins separated by structural highs (e.g. Faleide et al., 1984, 1993a, b; Marin et al., 2018a, b). At times when the structural highs were submerged, well-oxygenated hydraulic regimes may have persisted across the highs, whereas stagnant, oxygen deficient conditions may have prevailed in the deeper parts of the basins due to physical restriction and reduced bottom water circulation (e.g. Langrock et al., 2003). Consequently, wells targeting the structural highs that formed during the Early Cretaceous structuring-events, typically sample Lower Cretaceous stratigraphy which most likely exhibit low quantity and quality organic matter. Thus, elevated TOC and HI values, as well as increased source potential are generally expected for the deeper parts of the Early Cretaceous fault-bounded depocenters (e.g. Karlsen et al., 2004: Karlsen and Skeie, 2006). In addition, the data only give an indication of the remaining potential at the prevailing levels of thermal maturity. At early burial, the organic matter was less mature and had higher quality and quantity. Understanding variations in depositional environments and burial history of the potential source rock units is therefore essential. Below, a depositional model for each of the organic-rich units are presented, emphasizing various factors controlling their source potential, particularly focusing on the areas where they have been confirmed by exploration wells and thus hold the greatest potential.\n\n5.1\nControls on source rock distribution and potential\nTo form a viable source rock unit there must be sufficient primary biological productivity in the depositional environment (Calvert et al., 1996). Primary productivity near continental margins in the marine environment is dependent on nutrient influx either by fluvial run-off or upwelling of deep marine water (Demaison et al., 1983). The Loppa High which is situated in the center of the study area, was subaerially exposed during the Early Cretaceous (Faleide et al., 1993a; Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017) and was most likely a crucial source for influx of both sediments and nutrients (e.g. Seldal, 2005; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017, 2018a; \u00c4rlebrand et al., 2021). In addition, the warm and humid climate characterizing the Cretaceous period, promoted increased organic productivity and biotic changes (Leckie et al., 2002; Scotese et al., 2021) that was crucial for organic matter to be deposited (e.g. Rogov et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, the formation of fault bounded depocenters on the SW Barents Shelf and further south along the western margin of the NCS during the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous (e.g. Langrock et al., 2003), resulted in restricted circulation and anoxic conditions that ensured optimal preservation conditions, further prohibiting oxidative processes, degradation and consumption of organic matter (Demaison and Moore, 1980). These anoxic to suboxic conditions are also regarded as being the product of climatic variations associated with oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) (Leckie et al., 2002; Midtkandal et al., 2016; Rogov et al., 2020). However, the variations and differences in richness and quality of the organic matter is strongly linked to regional and local paleogeographic factors that affected the basin infill history.\nOther controlling factors include grain size and sedimentation rate. Grain size has implications towards preservation of organic matter, as coarse-grained sediments may allow circulation of oxygenated bottom waters into the sediments (Bordovskiy, 1965). In the study area, this could be a localized issue near active sediment source areas such as the Loppa High but for the wider SW Barents Shelf, most of the Cretaceous sediments appear to consist of marine mudrocks with low permeability. Sedimentation rate has a crucial control on the concentration of organic matter, as high rates will cause a dilution effect (Ibach, 1982). According to literature, sedimentation rate should ideally be approximately 1 mm\/year (Ibach, 1982; Bohacs et al., 2005). This could be problematic for potential source rock units situated in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Troms\u00f8 basins, as the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous rifting phase caused rapid subsidence and increased sedimentation rates along the RLFC and BFC (Faleide et al., 1984, 1993a, 1993b; Kairanov et al., 2021). In addition, the arrival of large prograding delta systems in the Barremian to early Aptian (from the NW) and in the Albian to Cenomanian (from the E to NE) may locally have contributed to increased sedimentation rates and consequently lowered the source rock potential in the receiving basins during these times.\n\n5.1.1\nDepositional model and source rock potential of the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit\nThe evaluation of the Hauterivian organic-rich unit shows that most of the samples have a kerogen Type III composition with variable TOC content and low S2 values (S2 < 2.5 mg\/g). This includes the wells in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (7321\/7\u20131.7321\/8\u20131, 7321\/9\u20131) and the southern parts of Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin (7219\/8-1 S). The unit was established as mature to overmature in the shallow basins and essentially overmature in well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 14A). Based on the maturity data in well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 16) and the lateral mapping of the iuH reflector, we interpret that there is presently no source rock potential for the Hauterivian organic-rich unit in the deep basins, caused by deep burial and compaction. However, a few wells in the Hammerfest Basin (7120\/8\u20133, 7120\/6-3 S, 7120\/9\u20132) have higher potential indicated by higher S2 and HI values (Fig. 14A and B). The most prolific samples are taken from well 7120\/6-3 S, located close to the NW part of the Hammerfest Basin (Figs. 9 and 10).\nThe upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit is also present in a more condensed form towards the central high of Hammerfest Basin (e.g. wells 7120\/8\u20133 and 7120\/9\u20132, Fig. 14). The iuH reflector extends further towards the transition to Troms\u00f8 Basin. In this transition, the reflector is part of the down-stepping array of normal faults of the RLFC. Source rock evaluation done on samples from wells located in this transition (e.g. 7120\/7\u20132, 7120\/7\u20133, 7119\/9\u20131, 7119\/12\u20133 and 7119\/12\u20131) confirms that the iuH reflector is not associated with a high potential source rock unit (Fig. 14). This supports our interpretation of a localized prolific upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit confined to a restricted depocenter, such as the NW part\/segment of the Hammerfest Basin.\nAccording to Ohm et al. (2008) the Knurr Formation (which includes the Hauterivian organic-rich unit of this study; Fig. 2) has a higher potential than the Kolje and Kolmule formations. Their study was predominantly focused on the Hammerfest Basin, where most exploration wells in the SW Barents Sea are located. Their initial findings suggest a low potential for the Knurr Formation, which is in accordance with our source rock evaluation (Fig. 14). However, we emphasize that there is an increased potential in the shallow depocenter of Hammerfest Basin (i.e. in well 7120\/6-3 S, NW part). Still, very few exploration wells have drilled the thick sedimentary successions in these depocenters, as most exploration wells typically target structural highs.\nThe SW Barents Shelf was subject to multiple episodes of rifting during the Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous extensional event (Faleide et al., 1984, 1993a, 1993b; Gabrielsen et al., 1990; Serck et al., 2017; Kairanov et al., 2021). The elevated potential documented in the NW part of the Hammerfest Basin is clearly linked to the patchy occurrence of smaller fault-bound depocenters that formed during the earliest Cretaceous. It is well known that structural confinement of marine basins may result in restricted water circulation, which eventually lead to oxygen deficient conditions that promote the preservation of organic matter (Demaison and Moore, 1980; Demaison et al., 1983).\nWe thus envisage that the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit in the Hammerfest Basin was deposited and preserved in a partly restricted marine setting, between the subaerially exposed Loppa High and the uplifted central arch (Figs. 10\u201318\nA). This depocenter formed in response to faulting along the AFC, which was initiated in the Late Jurassic \u2013 earliest Cretaceous (Wood et al., 1989; Gabrielsen et al., 1990). The uplifted central arch acted as intrabasinal highs where onlap terminations in sequence S0 and S1 indicate periodic subaerial exposure (Fig. 10) (Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2018b). To the north, the Loppa High was subaerially exposed at these times (Faleide et al., 1993a, 1993b) due to periodic and differential uplift that shifted the drainage patterns and promoted the development of incised valleys that routed sediments to the basin (Fig. 18A) (Indrev\u00e6r et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2018b). In this configuration, the NW corner of the Hammerfest Basin was a partly restricted, bounded between two subaerially exposed structural highs (Mar\u00edn et al., 2018b). Consequently, this gave the characteristic wedge shape of sequence S0 and S1 in the NW corner but also resulted in increased preservation potential for organic matter. (Fig. 18A). Deep-water conditions prevailed in the central parts of the Hammerfest Basin which was connected to the Troms\u00f8 Basin in the west securing better water circulation (Fig. 18A; Mar\u00edn et al., 2018b).\nThe kerogen Type III composition characterizing the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit, suggest that most of the organic matter is of terrestrial origin or of a partly oxidized type possibly including a resedimented fraction (Tissot et al., 1973; Peters, 1986; Peters and Cassa, 1994). The nearby subarial exposed Loppa High was most likely a source for the organic matter, which was transported to the basin by gravitational processes (Fig. 18A). In contrast, the source rock unit in well 7120\/6-3 S has a more dominant kerogen Type II composition (Fig. 14C). This may indicate that organic matter accumulated under restricted water circulation which allowed suboxic to anoxic conditions to develop (Demaison and Moore, 1980; Demaison et al., 1983). The nearby sediment source area also ensured high nutrient influx into the marine environment, allowing high productivity under the warm and humid climatic conditions that prevailed during the earliest Cretaceous (Fig. 18A).\n\n\n5.1.2\nDepositional model and source rock potential of the Barremian organic-rich unit\nThe iB reflector is widely distributed on the SW Barents Shelf and is penetrated by wells in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin and the Hammerfest Basin. Despite its wide distribution, most samples belonging to the Barremian organic-rich unit indicate a mature unit with a kerogen Type III composition yielding low generation potential (Fig. 15; Tables 2 and 3). Similar to the upper Hauterivian organic-rich unit, the most prolific unit occurs in well 7120\/6-3 S and 7120\/5\u20131 at the NW corner of the Hammerfest Basin (Fig. 15 and Table 3). At this location, the Barremian organic-rich unit have a kerogen Type II composition (Fig. 15C).\nIn the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, the iB reflector is located on top a SE-prograding sequence which probably was sourced from the Svalbard Platform that experienced significant uplift in the Barremian (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2017; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017; Midtkandal et al., 2019). In many prolific basins elsewhere, an elevated source rock potential (i.e. kerogen Type II\u2013I) is commonly reported within the top-set to bottomset of similar large-scale prograding clinoform successions (Barker, 1982; Kosters et al., 2000; Ulmishek, 2003). However, based on the mapping of the iB reflector and the lack of response in the wireline and Rock-Eval data (i.e. 7321\/7\u20131, 7321\/8\u20131 and 7321\/9\u20131), we conclude that the Barremian organic-rich unit does not have any potential in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin.\nThe source rock evaluation conducted on samples belonging to the Barremian organic-rich unit in well 7219\/8-1 S indicate that organic matter is of kerogen Type III and do not hold any potential based on low S2 and HI values (Fig. 15A and B). In addition, the unit is classified as post-mature based on Tmax values and two vitrinite reflectance samples (Fig. 15A). This has wider implication towards the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Troms\u00f8 basins, as any organic matter that belong to the potential Barremian organic-rich unit is most likely post-mature in the deeper basinal segments.\nDuring deposition of the Barremian organic-rich unit, the NW part of the Hammerfest Basin continued to be an important fault-bound depocenter, and the central arch and the Loppa High were still uplifted, both acting as source areas and exhibiting first-order controls on the basin configuration which was essential for anoxic conditions to be maintained (Fig. 18A).\nThe long-lived restricted character of the NW depocenter of the Hammerfest Basin governed water circulation and promoted water stratification and anoxic bottom water conditions (Fig. 18A). Increased fluvial run-off (from the Loppa High) and increased primary productivity influenced by the warm and humid climate and an associated oxygen consumption in the water mass further promoted anoxic bottom water conditions (Fig. 18A). This interpretation is coherent with the kerogen Type II composition of the Barremian organic-rich unit in well 7120\/6-3 S (Fig. 15).\n\n\n5.1.3\nDepositional model and source rock potential of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit\nThe seismic mapping and source rock evaluation of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit indicate that there is an elevated potential in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and possibly also in the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and Hammerfest basins (Table 3). The unit in well 7321\/9\u20131 was established to be the most prolific and is linked to negative amplitudes occurring in localized fault bounded depocenters in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 11A).\nThe negative amplitudes concentrated around well 7321\/9\u20131 also extends laterally towards the NNE (Fig. 11A) and appear to be confined to half-grabens (Fig. 5B) that most likely link up with the NNE \u2013 SSW-oriented RFS (Fig. 11A), cf. Serck et al. (2017). However, the strongest negative amplitudes are confined to the main depocenter of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 11A, controlled by the N\u2013S and NNE \u2013 SSW trending faults belonging the TFC and RFS (Serck et al., 2017). Strong negative amplitudes are also present in the southern part of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 11A). These amplitudes occur in a downfaulted section close to the LFC associated with a distinct thickness increase of the sequence S3 strata. This may indicate a connection to the suggested reactivation event in the early Aptian (Serck et al., 2017).\nIn the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, the lower Aptian organic-rich unit has kerogen Type III composition and is late mature in well 7219\/8-1 S (Table 3). The dim negative amplitudes surrounding well 7219\/8-1 S (Fig. 11A) further indicate that this area does not hold any high concentration of organic matter. However, based on the lateral mapping, the unit is most likely extending from well 7219\/8-1 S parallel to the nearby fault complexes (i.e. BFC and LFC) and could possibly be associated with the strong negative amplitudes present in the NE corner of the basin (Fig. 11A). It thus appears that the lower Aptian organic-rich unit preferably accumulated along the NE basin margins where conditions were favorable. The amount of TOC in marine sediments is controlled by the abundance and availability of organic matter, preservation and the degree of dilution by sedimentary input (Pedersen and Calvert, 1990). It thus seems that the lower Aptian organic-rich unit was subjected to less dilution effect further north towards the LFC. This may relate to a less active local source area of limited extent (i.e. Ringsel Ridge), possibly coupled with delimited or structurally diverted drainage patterns along the major fault complexes in the area. Consequently, this limited sediment input and the dilution effect in this area. In well 7219\/8-1 S, the elevated TOC values of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit are confined to a thick interval (159 m; Tables 1 and 2), possibly indicating that depositional conditions were favorable in places, but were generally negatively affected by high sedimentation rates.\nThe source rock evaluation and the seismic mapping indicate that the lower Aptian organic-rich unit has less potential in the Hammerfest Basin (Fig. 16). The elevated hydrogen content in wells 7120\/6\u20131 and 7120\/6-3 S is coupled to relatively low S2 and TOC values (Fig. 16), indicating a limited potential in the NW part of the basin. Well 7120\/7\u20133 is located in the middle of a cluster of high negative amplitudes. Here, the lower Aptian organic-rich unit is demonstrated to be one of the most prolific intervals of the whole succession (Table 3), indicating that there were favorable conditions for organic matter to accumulate and be preserved in the faulted transition to the Troms\u00f8 Basin. These conditions seem to be very localized as no other wells located in this transitional zone contain the lower Aptian organic-rich unit (e.g., wells 7119\/12\u20131, 7119\/12\u20133 and 7119\/9\u20131). This points to organic matter accumulation in depocenters along the RLFC.\nThe structural development of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin with multiple phases of faulting have clearly governed deposition and preservation of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit. The basin development is attributed to reactivation of the N\u2013 S- and NNE\u2013 SSW-oriented fault complexes (i.e. LFC, TFC and RFS), which follows the trend of older structural lineaments (Serck et al., 2017). These fault complexes were active during the latest Jurassic \u2013 Hauterivian and later reactivated in the early Aptian (Serck et al., 2017).\nConsidering this development and the distribution of the lower Aptian organic-rich unit, we suggest that it accumulated in restricted shallow, half-graben basins associated with movements along the TFC and RFS (Fig. 18B). The rates of subsidence increased during the latest Jurassic \u2013 Hauterivian rifting, eventually creating increased bathymetric relief, and promoting the development of syn-tectonic growth wedges near the TFC and RFS (Serck et al., 2017) (Fig. 5A). The subsequent arrival of the SE-prograding clinoform succession (sequence S2, Mar\u00edn et al., 2017b) during the Barremian filled much of this relief, but was most likely delimited by uplifted footwall highs (Serck et al., 2017) (e.g. location of well 7321\/8\u20131; Fig. 5B). Fault reactivation during the early Aptian renewed the creation of accommodation space in the half-grabens. Coupled with the eustatic sea-level rise and ocean anoxia in the early Aptian (e.g. Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976; Jenkyns, 1980), this created an ideal setting which allowed organic matter to be preserved in a localized, structurally restricted marine basin (Fig. 18B). The negative amplitude map supports this interpretation, as the greatest negative amplitudes are observed in the half-grabens along the TFC and RFS (Fig. 11A). In addition, the kerogen Type II composition indicates that the organic-rich unit were deposited in a marine environment under anoxic conditions (Demaison and Moore, 1980; Demaison et al., 1983).\nFurthermore, the OAE1a has been recorded on the Svalbard Platform (Midtkandal et al., 2016) and linked to a time-equivalent regional extensive lower Aptian flooding surface (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2019). Here, a lower Aptian source rock unit associated with the flooding surface is located atop of a thick coal-bearing paralic succession, testifying to its proximal position near the northern margin of the Barents Shelf at these times. This unit apparently has a localized wet gas potential (e.g. Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2019). Although representing deposition under principle different structural settings (i.e. platform versus half graben), the source rock unit on the Svalbard Platform may represent a lateral equivalent to the unit documented in well 7321\/9\u20131 (e.g. Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2019) testifying to the high productivity in this period. However, to confidently establish a link between the lower Aptian source rock unit in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin and the OAE1a, carbon and oxygen isotope methodologies should be implemented in the future (e.g. Herrle et al., 2015; Midtkandal et al., 2016; Vickers et al., 2016). There is also the issue of age uncertainties in well 7321\/9\u20131 (Corseri et al., 2018). However, the time-equivalent deposition of the kerogen Type II-III source rock unit on the Svalbard Platform may indicate that the lower Aptian source rock potential is of regional significance, but dependent on structural confinement to generate an oil-prone source rock unit (Grundv\u00e5g et al., 2019).\n\n\n5.1.4\nDepositional model and source rock potential of the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit\nBased on the lateral mapping and evaluation of the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit, we suggest that this unit has greatest potential in the northern part of Troms\u00f8 Basin at the transition to the Veslem\u00f8y High (Figs. 13B\u201317). At this location, well 7218\/11\u20131 penetrated an immature unit with a kerogen Type II\u2013III composition (Table 3). This suggests that the upper Cenomanian unit could have source rock potential in similar restricted settings. In addition, the strong negative amplitudes located in the transition to Veslem\u00f8y High and the Senja Ridge could indicate that the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit has increased potential in relation to these highs (Fig. 12B). The elongated amplitudes seen in the amplitude map (Fig. 12) seem to follow the orientation of the seismic lines and could indicate amplitude differences between the surveys.\nOne central question is whether this potential can be correlated to the negative amplitudes seen in the Troms\u00f8 Basin (Figs. 12B and 13A). The restricted character of the depositional setting of the mudrocks sampled in well 7218\/11-1 makes such correlation difficult for a wider basin perspective. In addition, exploration wells drilled on local highs and in association with salt domes do not provide the stratigraphic information needed (i.e. 7219\/8-1 S, 7119\/9\u20131, 7119\/12\u20133). The Cenomanian source rock potential is, therefore, still unknown in the Troms\u00f8 Basin. This is coupled to the likelihood that the basin was well oxygenated and subject to high sedimentation rates associated with the arrival of the delta system prograding from the E and NE during the late Albian and Cenomanian (i.e. sequences 5 and 6; Mar\u00edn et al., 2017, Fig. 2).\nIn the Hammerfest Basin, strong negative amplitudes occur in the proximity of well 7120\/7\u20133, possibly indicating abundant organic matter in this area (Fig. 12B). However, the source rock evaluation conducted on samples from well 7120\/7-3 shows that there is no Cenomanian source rock potential here (Fig. 17A). Towards the NW corner of the Hammerfest Basin, well 7120\/6-3 S records elevated hydrogen content in the upper Cenomanian unit (Fig. 17C). However, the source rock evaluation shows that the unit has low TOC and S2 values, which limit the potential.\nThe upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit was deposited in a half-graben situated on the northern edge of the Troms\u00f8 Basin, as part of the Veslem\u00f8y High (Fig. 18C). The development of this half-graben is attributed to the formation a series of NE\u2013SW-striking faults, possibly belonging to the BFC and RLFC (Kairanov et al., 2021). In this area, Valanginian \u2013 late Barremian and Aptian \u2013 Albian faulting have been documented (Faleide et al., 1993a; Kairanov et al., 2021). This faulting eventually led to rotation of fault blocks and the formation of localized half-graben basins (Fig. 18C). During the Cenomanian, the Veslem\u00f8y High was subject to uplift (Kairanov et al., 2021), further restricting the half-graben basins and limiting oxygenated water circulation. This is supported by the kerogen Type II-III composition of the organic-rich unit, which indicates that anoxic to suboxic conditions must have prevailed during deposition (cf. Demaison and Moore, 1980; Demaison et al., 1983).\n\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for exploration\nExploration well 7219\/8-1 S provides an important stratigraphic control for all the Lower Cretaceous organic-rich units in the deep Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins and adjacent areas (Fig. 2). The source rock evaluation conducted on samples from the four potential source rock units investigated in this study, provides an indication as to the potential in the deeper basinal segments.\nData from well 7219\/8-1 S establish the lower Aptian unit to be kerogen Type III dominated and in the late mature stages, still part of the oil window. Hence, we conclude that any organic matter deposited before the early Aptian is most likely post-mature in the deeper basinal areas along the RLFC and BFC. This has implications for hydrocarbon exploration in these frontier areas along the western shelf margin. However, the lower Aptian organic-rich unit is considered to have the greatest potential and should consequently be considered when exploration strategies are discussed for the SW Barents Shelf. The presence of a mature to late mature lower Aptian source rock unit in well 7219\/8-1 S, may thus represent a local source for exploration targets in the areas surrounding the RLFC and BFC, as well as towards the flanks of the deep basins (Fig. 11A). Because the traditional Upper Jurassic source rock unit is overmature in these areas (Dore, 1995; Mar\u00edn et al., 2020), the lower Aptian source rock unit could present a viable alternative. However, as there is limited well control in the deep basins, seismic attributes and lateral mapping is key to understanding the distribution and potential of any source rock units distributed along the fault complexes.\nWe also demonstrate that the lower Aptian unit in well 7219\/8-1 S can be traced laterally into the strong negative amplitudes in the NE corner of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, confined between the uplifted Stappen High and the LFC (Fig. 11A). This location and similar settings thus seem to be key locations for the occurrence of the lower Aptian source rock unit. Furthermore, the Lower Aptian unit in well 7321\/9\u20131 is established to be the most prolific (Table 3). The patchy occurrence of strong negative amplitudes located in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin (Fig. 11A) could potentially indicate local accumulations of organic matter, with similar characteristics to the source rock unit established in well 7321\/9\u20131. However, the Fingerdjupet Subbasin is also one of the most uplifted areas on the SW Barents Shelf (Lasabuda et al., 2021), which further complicate exploration.\nThe upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit could potentially be a viable option for the wider Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins. However, this unit is absent in the Hammerfest and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins. The only documented occurrence is in well 7218\/11\u20131 in the transition to the Veslem\u00f8y High (Fig. 13B). We therefore suggest that the greatest potential of the upper Cenomanian organic-rich unit is most likely linked to the development off the structural highs, as faulting along their margins developed half-graben depocenters which promoted the formation of restricted marine basins suitable for organic matter to accumulate. A basin wide distribution thus seems unlikely due to the generally well oxygenated waters prevailing the region at these times (e.g. Smelror, 2009).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nBy combining 2D seismic data, amplitude maps and wireline logs with total organic carbon (TOC) and Rock-Eval data, this study documents the presence of four potential source rock units within the Lower Cretaceous succession on the SW Barents Shelf. These are the: (1) upper Hauterivian (2) Barremian, (3) lower Aptian, and (4) upper Cenomanian units. We demonstrate that the deposition and preservation of these units are coupled to localized and restricted fault bound depocenters which developed during multiple episodes of fault activity, mainly attributed to Late Jurassic \u2013 Early Cretaceous rifting and local reactivation events along the western Barents Shelf margin.\nThe Hauterivian and Barremian organic-rich units exhibit TOC contents in the range of 1.0\u20135.7 wt % and show the greatest potential in the NW part of the Hammerfest Basin. They do not show any potential in the deeper Troms\u00f8 and Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya basins. This is mainly due to deep burial and dilution effects related to regionally high sedimentation rates associated with progradation and the arrival of a large delta system from the west and northwest during the late Albian to Cenomanian times.\nThe lower Aptian organic-rich unit exhibits TOC contents in the range of 0.57\u20135.3 wt % and shows the greatest potential by well 7321\/9-1 located in the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. It can be traced laterally from this well towards strong negative amplitudes in the central parts of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, across the Randi Fault Set and further into the southern part of the Fingerdjupet Subbasin. These negative amplitudes may possibly indicate favorable TOC contents, thus resembling the lower Aptian source rock unit in well 7321\/9\u20131, which exhibits high TOC contents (4.0\u20135.3 wt %). The negative amplitude reflector associated with the lower Aptian source rock unit in well 7321\/9\u20131 can also be traced across from the Fingerdjupet Subbasin into the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Basin, where the unit appears to be composed of kerogen Type III organic matter in the late mature stages (i.e. well 7219\/8-1 S). This indicates that the lower Aptian unit could potentially be a viable source rock unit along the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8yrenna Fault Complex and the Terningen Fault Complex.\nThe Cenomanian organic-rich unit only appears as an immature, kerogen II-III dominated unit confined to a half-graben situated in the northern part of the Troms\u00f8 Basin, at the faulted transition to the Veslem\u00f8y High. Correlation towards negative amplitudes located in the deeper basin segments is difficult due to poor well control. Although, the unit can be traced across the Troms\u00f8 Basin, there is no indication of a viable source rock of basinal or regional significance.\n\n","37":"","38":"","39":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Greater Caucasus mountain range, situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, is an outstanding landmark at the crossroads between Asia and Europe (Fig. 1\n). The Caucasus forms an orogenic system whose geologic structure and position in the Alpine-Himalayan belt is determined by the still converging Eurasian and Arabian lithospheric plates (Allen et al., 2004; Gamkrelidze, 1986; Jackson, 1992; McClusky et al., 2000; Tan and Taymaz, 2006; Vernant et al., 2004). During the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic times, the region belonged to the now vanished Neotethys-Eurasia ocean-continent convergence zone (Adamia et al., 2011; Adamia and Zakariadze, 2011). It has undergone, since the Late Triassic, a history of regional extension and compression summarized as the Cimmerian (Eo-, Meso-, Neo-) and Alpine stages (Nikishin et al., 2001; Vincent et al., 2011). The Greater Caucasus mountain range arises from the inversion, during the Alpine stage, from the former Greater Caucasus Basin. This intracontinental rift basin evolved in a back-arc rift setting linked to north-directed subduction under the Lesser Caucasus to the south (Sosson et al., 2016). The Mountain range develops an overall doubly verging orogenic wedge, with important along strike changes in geometry from west to east. The main transport direction is to the South (Dotduyev, 1986), towards the pro-wedge domain of the orogenic wedge, as opposed to the north-directed thrusts of the retro-wedge (Forte et al., 2014a; Mosar et al., 2010; Sosson et al., 2016).\nThe objective of our paper is to discuss the present-day structural setting along a crosg section through the whole Greater Caucasus, and link the different tectonic zones to their original paleotectonic setting. We thus introduce a new paleotectonic reconstruction of the Greater Caucasus Basin. Hereafter, we present the results from field investigations along the Georgian Military Road in Eastern Georgia and Russai, and adjoining valleys, between Tbilissi and Vladikavkaz (Fig. 2\n), and summarize earlier works that to present the general tectonic structure of this part of the Central Greater Caucasus (GC). Collecting new structural data such bedding dips, cleavage orientation, fold axis trend and axial surfaces, as well as faults and thus detailing and densifying existing map data, made it possible to produce a new set of geological maps (appendixes) and to extract kinematic information. Fieldwork was conducted in the frame of sevral projects over a period of several years between 2010 and 2018.\nIn the light of an inferred intracontinental and doubly verging character of the GC orogen (Mosar et al., 2010), the delimited and described tectonic units are restored into a pre-collisional (Early Cenozoic) rift setting, from which the present-day structure of the Caucasus region and more specifically the Greater Caucasus is inherited.\n\n\n2\nRegional geology and geodynamics of the Caucasus\nThe highest mountain range in the Caucasus region, the Geater Caucasus (GC), is a doubly verging fold-and-thrust belt (FTB), which originated from the tectonic inversion of a Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic intracontinental rift, the GC Basin, that bordered the Scythian Platform (southern part of the East European\/Russian Platform) to the south (Adamia and Zakariadze, 2011; Gobarenko et al., 2015; Mosar et al., 2010; Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016; Yilmaz et al., 2014) (Fig. 1). Prior to the Arabia-Eurasia collision, this deep marine basin was located to the north of the active margin of the continental Eurasian plate in a supra-subduction setting with respect to the northward-directed subduction of the Neotethys Ocean (Adamia et al., 1977, 2011; Golonka, 2004; Nikishin et al., 2001; Philip et al., 1989; Sosson et al., 2016; Zonenshain and LePichon, 1986). The GC Basin developed following the Late Triassic accretion of the Cimmerian Terranes to Eurasia and the initiation of the Neotethys subduction at the southern edge of the Eurasian plate (Eo-Cimmerian event) (Golonka, 2004; Nikishin et al., 2001; Stampfli et al., 2013). Lower Jurassic back-arc extension separated the Transcaucasian-Lesser Caucasus (South Caucasus) domains from the Scythian Platform (North Caucasus), thus opening the GC rift-basin (Golonka, 2004; Khain, 2007). Rift activity encompassed the Middle Jurassic period and intensely thinned the continental crust underlying the basin (Adamia et al., 1977, 2011; Adamia and Zakariadze, 2011; Khain, 2007; Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016). This hyperextension of the continental crust is recorded in the present axial part of the GC belt by a mid-ocean ridge basalt-like (MORB) magmatism that occurred during the Lower-Middle Jurassic in the GC Basin axis (Panov and Lomize, 2007; Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016). A regionally observed Bathonian unconformity (Mid-Cimmerian event) marked the onset of the post-rift thermally subsiding basin development (Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016).\nMarine sedimentation within the GC Basin began in the Sinemurian (in places Late Hettangian (Adamia et al., 2011; Khain, 2007) and included the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Early Paleogene (Dotduyev, 1986; Adamia et al., 2011; Nikishin et al., 2001; Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016; Blackbourn et al., 2021). Terrigenous and hemipelagic deposits, mainly shales, characterized the pre-Callovian basin infill (Adamia et al., 1977; Saintot et al., 2006; Yakovlev, 2012), whereas thick flysch-like units composed of siliciclastic and carbonate turbidite sequences define the Upper Jurassic to Late Eocene times (Nikishin et al., 2010; Saintot et al., 2006; Yakovlev, 2012). In total, the thickness of the basin infill exceeds 10\u00a0km (Adamia et al., 2011).\nThe Late Eocene-Oligocene is considered as the period of beginning of the Alpine orogenic stage (Mosar, 2010; Saintot et al., 2006; Saintot and Angelier, 2002; Sosson et al., 2016; Trifonov and Sokolov, 2014; Vincent et al., 2017; Yakovlev, 2012) i.e. the incipient tectonic inversion of the GC Basin (Nikishin et al., 2010). The closure of the Neotethys and the initiation of the Arabia-Eurasia continent-continent collision in the Late Eocene-Oligocene (e.g. at 36\u00a0Ma (Ballato et al., 2011), 35\u00a0Ma (Allen and Armstrong, 2008), 35-30\u00a0Ma (Jolivet and Faccenna, 2000), or 30-25\u00a0Ma (Neill et al., 2015) rapidly transferred the compression northwards and induced the tectonic inversion and incipient uplift of the GC (Vincent et al., 2007, 2016). The Arabia-Eurasia collision and the onset of the orogenic process in the GC is marked in the Caucasus region first by the regional deposition of the mud-prone, gypsiferous, and organic-rich Maykop formation (Oligocene-Lower Miocene) in isolated euxinic basins of the eastern Paratethys (Adamia et al., 2011; Adamia and Zakariadze, 2011; Allen and Armstrong, 2008; Vincent et al., 2016), and then by the formation of the foredeeps adjacent to the GC (Adamia et al., 2011; Almendinger et al., 2011; Ershov et al., 1999, 2003; Khlebnikova et al., 2014; Mikhailov et al., 1999; Nikishin et al., 2010; Timoshkina et al., 2010). Furthermore, on both sides of the GC, Oligocene (Maykop) and younger sediments display divergent paleocurrents, away from the axis of the growing orogenic range (Vincent et al., 2007, 2016) and comprise erosional material derived from the crystalline core of the GC and from inverted Jurassic to Eocene basin deposits, thus indicating a subaerial sediment source since Oligocene (Khlebnikova et al., 2014; Vincent et al., 2016).\nWe divide the present Caucasus region into five large-scale tectonic domains that are (Fig. 1), from north to south, (1) the Fore-Caucasus superimposed on the Scythian Platform and comprising the Azov-Kuban Basin in the west and the Terek-Caspian Basin in the, east separated by the Stavropol High (Mikhailov et al., 1999); (2) the Greater Caucasus sensu lato forming the main topography; (3) the Transcaucasian domain, which consists of the Dzirula-Shatsky block (including the overlying Rioni and Kartli foreland basins) and the Ajara-Trialeti FTB bordering this block to the south (Tari et al., 2021b); (4) the Lesser Caucasus-South Caspian domain that spans the Mtkvari (Kura)-South Caspian Megadepression (Khain and Bogdanov 2006) and the former intra-island arc units of the Lesser Caucasus to the south (Artvin-Bolnisi block, Somkheto-Karabakh and Talysh FTB (Adamia et al., 2011; Sosson et al., 2016; Yilmaz et al., 2014); (5) and the South Armenian domain situated to the south of the Sevan-Akera suture zone and corresponding to the eastern part of the Taurides-Anatolides-South Armenian microplate (Sosson et al., 2010, 2016).\nThe Greater Caucasus orogen in the broad sense trends rectilinearly from the Kerch Strait, east of Crimea, to the Absheron Peninsula in eastern Azerbaijan (Khain, 1975). Its northern portion is formed by the southern edge of the Scythian Platform that is drawn and incorporated into the orogen in domains such as the uplifted Laba-Malka Homocline to the west and the Terek-Sunzha and Dagestan FTB to the east (Gamkrelidze and Shengelia, 2005; Khain, 1975; Sobornov, 1996, 2021\nYakovlev, 2012). The southern active deformation front of the GC orogen includes the offshore Tuapse Trough in the Black Sea (Almendinger et al., 2011; Nikishin et al., 2015), the Western Georgian Rioni foreland FTB (Tibaldi et al., 2017), and the Eastern Georgian-Azerbaijani Mtkvari (Kura)-Kartli foreland FTB (Forte et al., 2013; Mosar et al., 2010).\nIn a narrower sense however, and in the light of a paleotectonic affiliation, the Pshekish-Tyrnyauz Fault and the Racha-Lechkhumi Fault separate the GC from the Scythian Platform to the north and from the Transcaucasian domain to the south, respectively (Adamia et al., 1977; Khain, 1984, 2007; Yakovlev, 2012). The Main Caucasus Thrust (MCT) (Dotduyev, 1986) forms the largest internal fault and runs along strike the core of the GC core over more than 1000\u00a0km (Mosar et al., 2010; Yakovlev, 2012). Along the MCT's western part, pre-Mesozoic basement is exhumed (Main Range) (Somin, 2011), whereas in the east, it separates sedimentary rocks of Lower and Middle Jurassic ages (Mosar et al., 2010). The MCT divides the GC into a northern (the Main Range and Northern Slope) and southern domain (the Southern Slope) (Trifonov and Sokolov, 2014) and is considered as a major inherited structure of the former GC Basin axis.\n\n\n3\nThe Greater Caucasus structure along the Georgian Military Road (Georgia \u2013 North Ossetia-Alania)\nIn order to densify existing information, we collected structural data in outcrops along, and in vicinity of the Georgian Military Road between Ananuri and the Georgia-Russia border in the Darial Gorge, i.e. along the rivers Aragvi and Terek (Tergi) and some tributary rivers (Fig. 2; supplemental material 1\u20133). Geological maps and published results pertaining to the structural geology of the North Caucasian (Russian) part of this area supplemented our field observations made in Georgia. Running between Tbilisi and Vladikavkaz, the Georgian Military Road is a major route passing the GC mountain belt across its axis and hence permits insight into its tectonic structure. At this longitude, the GC comprises in its core the Main Range zone framed to the south and north by the tectonic units of the Southern Slope zone and Northern Slope zone, respectively. Combining all available data with field observations we compiled a new geological-tectonic map of the area (Fig. 3\n; see also detailed 1:100\u2032000 map in supplemental material 1,2,3 and detailed map legend in supplemental material 4).\n\n3.1\nStructural zones of the Greater Caucasus\n\n3.1.1\nMain range\nIn respect to the topographic crest of the GC and its tectonic structure, the Main Range zone represents the most internal tectonic zone (Figs. 1\u20133). It builds up the core of the GC FTB and is delimited to the south by the Kazbegi thrust (local name of the MCT in the Military road area (Mosar et al., 2010)) and to the north by the Buron-Lars thrust, both mostly E-W striking structures. The Buron-Lars thrust may possibly correspond to the Psekish-Tyrnyauz Fault farther west in the central GC north of Mt Elbrus (Figs. 1 and 2). The Main Range zone comprises the oldest rocks along the investigated section, namely Upper Paleozoic granitic rocks exposed as the Dariali and Gveleti crystalline basement massifs (Gamkrelidze and Shengelia, 2005) brought to the surface along the steeply north-dipping Amali and Gveleti thrusts. The pre-Mesozoic basement massifs are witnesses of a polyphase geological history including the Baikalian, Caledonian, and Variscan events. They include Devonian-early Carboniferous arc-volcanism associated with supra-subduction zone ophiolites and numerous late-post Variscan intrusives of Permian age. Traces of Alpine deformation are widespread in the granitic rocks and expressed in form of folds, fractures, and cataclastic and mylonitic shear zones. Sinemurian to Toarcian folded terrigenous clastic rocks, mainly hemipelagic shales, are found around the massifs in tectonic contact. In places, the Sinemurian sediments overlay unconformably the granitic rocks, whereas at others Upper Carboniferous phyllite and quartzite (Gavrilov et al., 1999) constitute the lithological transition from crystalline basement to deep marine sedimentary basin fill. Across the Main Range zone, abundant dolerite sills and dykes intruded the granitic rocks of the Dariali and Gveleti massifs, as well as, the shales of Sinemurian-Pliensbachian age which form impressive cliffs and outstanding outcrops in the Stepantsminda area. Locally, the Pliensbachian shale hosts intercalated MORB-like tholeiitic basalts in form of agglomerates and pillow-lavas of Aalenian age (Adamia et al., 2011; Saintot et al., 2006). Their occurrence is restricted to the southern periphery of the Main Range zone in proximity to the MCT and to a tectonic klippe (Figs. 2 and 3), forming the outstanding Chaukhi mountain peaks (Fiagdon-Chauki \u201cnappe\u201d). The subvolcanic and subaqueous volcanic features in the Main Range zone relate to paroxysms of magmatic activity associated to important rifting and crustal extension in the GC Basin development throughout the Lower Jurassic and Aalenian (Adamia et al., 1977; Khain, 1975; Panov and Lomize, 2007).\n\n\n3.1.2\nSouthern slope\nThe Southern Slope zone extends from the MCT in the north to the Kartli Basin in the south, and exposes the Lower Jurassic to Eocene fill of the former GC Basin in a succession of south to SSW-directed thrust slices, i.e. imbricates (Figs. 2 and 3). Four largely ESE-WNW trending tectonic subzones are recognized in the Southern Slope zone, each delimited by major thrusts and characterized by specific lithologies exposed at surface.\nThe Kazbegi-Lagodekhi zone features Toarcian to Bathonian argillaceous-sandy rocks, mainly hemipelagic shales, and extends from the MCT in the north to the Truso thrust in the south. The latter and the Gudauri thrust delimit the Upper Jurassic Kolosan-Pakhviji calciturbidite zone to the north and south, respectively. To the south, the Mestia-Tianeti flysch zone comprises Cretaceous to Eocene mainly siliciclastic and clastic limestone turbidite deposits. It lies south of the Gudauri thrust and overrides the Transcaucasian tectonic units to the south, i.e. the Gagra-Java zone and the Kartli Basin. Finally, the Ksani-Arkala parautochthonous zone, which exposes Aalenian sandy shales and Bajocian calc-alkaline volcaniclastics (\u201cPorphyrite series\u201d) in its core (Adamia, 2004; Gudjabidze and Gamkrelidze, 2003), forms an isolated and restricted thrust slice that was detached from the underthrusting Gagra-Java zone (Gamkrelidze and Kuloshvili, 1998). The frontal part of the Mestia-Tianeti zone, including the Ksani-Arkala zone, features a complex imbrication of southerly-directed thrust slices (\u201cnappes\u201d) (Leonov, 2016), where erosion subsequently exposed numerous tectonic windows and klippen that developed along flat lying thrusts (Gamkrelidze, 1991; Gamkrelidze and Gamkrelidze, 1977). Locally, in this part of the GC, the thrust slices contain late Eocene olistostrome deposits featuring predominantly olistoliths of Upper Jurassic reef limestone and Bajocian volcaniclastics (Maisadze, 2008). Outcrops throughout the Mestia-Tianeti flysch zone also feature syn-sedimentary structures in form of normal faults and slumped rock layers disrupting the regular bedding of the turbiditic deposits. They attest to the pre-collisional extensional character of the former GC Basin with structural high interpreted to be tilted blocks and to soft sediment slope instabilities that occurred within it.\nThe most striking feature of the Southern Slope zone is its exclusively south-vergent character of its E-W to ESE-WNW trending structures (Figs. 3\u20135\n\n). The W-E to WNW-ESE regional structural trend is given by the bedding dip data, the thrust surface direction and the fold axes (also the cleavage\/bedding intersection lineation (Figs. 4 and 5A).\nThe top-to-the-south movement is clearly expressed by the thrust orientation and dip to the N-NNE (Figs. 3 and 4; 5A), and the dipping of the fold axial surfaces to the N-NNE (Figs. 3 and 4; 5 A, B, C). The recurrence of Upper Cretaceous limestone flysch embedded in Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic flysch in the Mestia-Tianeti zone allows the distinction of a series of kilometric near-cylindrical folds, whose subhorizontal axes generally have an E-W orientation (Fig. 4). Across the Southern Slope zone, the Jurassic to Early Paleogene strata are deformed in tight to isoclinal folds. These southward inclined to overturned folds are associated to the southerly-directed throw along the thrusts during the Alpine inversion phase. Non-cylindrical folds with NW-plunging axes characterize the Kolosan-Pakhviji zone, in particular. Additionally, we can observe that fold axis are deviating fom there horizontal position and are sheared into the general thrust inclination towards the direction of transport. This can especially be seen in the Kolosan-Pakhveji Zone (Figs. 3, 4 and 5B, C), but also to the north and south, and is linked to the important shear component associated with the top-to-the south transport. The very low-grade metamorphic conditions (<300\u00a0\u00b0C) have favoured the formation of a penetrative rock cleavage that is found mostly in clay rich rocks (see also Vasey et al., 2020). Cleavage planes measured over the entire area of the Southern Slope are regularly dipping towards the north and are subparallel to the fold axial planes, and are thus identified as axial-planar cleavage concomitant to the folding and implicitly thrusting (Fig. 4). This foliation developed as fracture cleavage in the competent sandstone and limestone beds and as slaty and pencil cleavage in the clay-rich rocks.\nImportant deformation zones characterize and are indicative of the presence of major thrusts, particularly in road cuts in the Mestia-Tianeti zone along the Military Road (Fig. 5A). Here, the otherwise regularly north-dipping turbidite layers become increasingly deformed and dislocated in proximity to these thrust zones, resulting in local accumulation of small-scale reverse shear zones and folds. As a major discontinuity in the core of the GC, the MCT presents itself as a roughly 100\u00a0m wide deformation zone exposed by a steep road cut north of Stepantsminda (see also Vasey et al., 2020). The deformation induced by the top-to-the-south-directed throw along this thrust is expressed at different degrees over the thrust zone as discrete fault planes, shear zones and fault breccia and cataclasites in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian shales and dolerite intrusions. Measured reverse fault planes in the entire investigated area strike in average ESE-WNW to E-W and reflect the general trend of the larger-scale structures of the Southern Slope zone (Fig. 3; 5A).\n\n\n3.1.3\nNorthern slope\nThe Northern Slope zone consists of two E-W trending tectonic subzones, the internal Digoro-Ossetian folded zone and the external Homocline Range zone. The Digoro-Ossetian zone extents north of the Main Range zone (Fig. 6\n). Pre-Callovian, sandy-argillaceous Lower and Middle Jurassic rocks arranged in a series of north-directed thrust slices (Gavrilov et al., 1999) characterize this tectonic zone. Tight, north-vergent, overturned folds further indicate north-directed sense of movement along the thrusts. The degree of folding and cleavage intensity in this zone decreases steadily from south to north, i.e. from the internal towards the external part of the zone, and cleavage disappears completely towards the Homocline Range zone (Gavrilov et al., 1999). Overall, this reflects the transition from the folded domain to the uniformly dipping homoclinal parts of the Northern Slope zone. In the Homocline Range zone, the Upper Jurassic to Eocene platform-type carbonate-sandy rocks form a northward plunging homoclinal structure expressed at surface by a succession of E-W trending cuestas (the topography ranges from 3000m near the main range to 1000m in the northern foreland). South-directed movement along north-dipping thrusts that developed in Kimmeridgian-Tithonian evaporites of this zone (Sobornov, 1996), resulted in the doubling of the Upper Jurassic-Cretaceous lithological sequence and the subsequent emplacement of small tectonic klippen. The eastern part of the Homocline is in a transition zone to the eastern GS foreland north of Vladikavkaz, the east Dagestan foreland FTB (Mosar et al., 2010; Sobornov, 2021).\nTo the north, and constituting the foothills of the GC, Oligocene and Miocene at first euxinic (Maykop formation) then detrital molasse-type sediments of the Terek-Caspian Basin overlie the Homocline Range zone, locally in unconformable manner (Sobornov 1996, 2020). The Pliocene-Quaternary Akhchagilian-Apsheronian clastics, like in much of the Fore-Caucasus area, unconformably cover older rock formations of the Terek-Caspian Basin (Adamia et al., 2011; Mikhailov et al., 1999; Sobornov, 1996). East of Vladikavkaz, gentle anticlines and synclines developed in the sediments of the Terek-Caspian Basin as the continuation of westward plunging structures of the Northeastern GC (Dagestan FTB) (Pismennyi et al., 2006, Sobornov, 2020).\n\n\n\n3.2\nThe Greater Caucasus - A doubly vergent fold-and-thrust belt\nIn agreement with Mosar et al. (2010), we interpret the GC orogen at the longitude of the Georgian Military Road as a doubly vergent FTB. Its pro-wedge includes the Southern Slope and northern Kartli Basin, whereas the retro-wedge developed in the Northern Slope and southern Terek Caspian Basin. From the core (Main Range zone) to the external parts of the mountain belt, the thrusting style evolves from thick-skinned crustal ramp-dominated to thin-skinned d\u00e9collement-dominated. In general, both styles of deformation coexist along the belt (Mosar et al., 2010; Saintot et al., 2006).\nIn the subsurface, the Main Range zone forms a triangular shaped domain that is limited to the south by the MCT and to the north by steep back-thrusts. It contains a large antiformal structure that exposes the pre-Mesozoic basement massifs in its core, to form the highest summits of the GC. This central zone corresponds to the area of highest uplift observed in the GC and is associated to this triangular zone above the MCT (Mosar et al., 2010).\nTo the south, a succession of imbricated thrust slices with top-to-the south-west rooted in the basement, characterizes the tectonic structure of the pro-wedge. The wedge actively propagates southwards into its own Cenozoic foreland and thrusts onto the Transcaucasian Dzirula-Shatsky block (Khain, 2007), a basement culmination that is exposed transversally due to the orogenic loading of the GC and the Ajara-Trialeti belts on both sides (Banks et al., 1997). This basement ridge corresponds to the southern margin of the former GC basin. The pro-wedge incorporated the autochthonous Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic cover of this basement block (including the parautochthonous Gagra-Java zone) and actively deforms the overlying late Cenozoic foreland basin deposits of the Kartli Basin (Gamkrelidze, 1991; Banks et al., 1997; Gamkrelidze and Kuloshvili, 1998; Adamia et al., 2010), hence referred to as the Kartli foreland FTB. The GC pro-wedge, i.e. the Kartli foreland FTB (Tari et al., 2021a, 2021b), is bound to the south by the north-vergent structures of the Ajara-Trialeti FTB (Alania et al., 2015; Tari et al., 2021b).\nAccording to (Sobornov, 1996, 2021), two stacked wedges that propagate northwards into the subsurface of the Terek-Caspian Basin define the structure of the retro-wedge in this part of the GC. This structures can be correlated to the East with the Dagestan foreland fold-and-thrust belt. The internal (lower) wedge is detached along a d\u00e9collement that ramps from the basement in the mountain belt to the Tithonian evaporites of the Scythian Platform. Back-thrusts cutting across the Upper Jurassic-Cretaceous rocks constrain its roof. The wedge comprises a thrust duplex, whose stacking tilted the overlying sediments of the Scythian Platform and created the north-dipping homoclinal structure. The external (upper) wedge is floored and roofed by a flat hinterland-verging thrust in the Tithonian evaporites and a back-thrust in the Maykop mudstones, respectively. The arcuate Terek-Sunzha folded zone delimits this wedge to the north with the Terek anticline forming its northernmost structure at the surface. The tectonic wedging is accounted for the lack of surficial hinterland-verging (north-directed) thrusts in this part of the North Caucasus (Sobornov, 1994, 1996, 2021).\nThus, the small and medium scale structures observed in the field, and described in detailed profiles and on detailed geological maps, constrain our understanding of the larger subsurface built of the GC FTB. The prominent south-directed movement can be derived from the structures associated to thrusts and fold geometry. Thickness of layers and outcropping basement, both to the south and the north, help constrain the deeper structures and the thick-skinned tectonics (Figs. 3 and 6). This includes the central section where uplift is the most prominent and recent, the importance of the MCT and the doubly vergent geometry of the overal orogene. This latter aspect is especially support by the north-directed thrusting in the northern GC. This is clearly shown in the Dagestan foreland area (Sobornov, 1994, 1996, 2021), and has also been proposed and discussed in Mosar et al. (2010).\nThe beginning of the orogenic process and subaerial uplift can be dated as far back as earliest Oligocene, possibly even Eocene, following an important Paleocene unformity (Egan et al., 2009; Mosar et al., 2010; Vincent et al., 2016). Significant uplift started as early as earliest Oligocene (Avdeev and Niemi, 2011; Vincent et al., 2016a), with a post-Sarmatian age (\u223c12 My) climax as documented by Sarmatian marine shell found on the summit of Mount Shadhag (4250m) in N Azerbaijan (ref. in Mosar et al., 2010). Tectonic geomorphology studies in the southern foreland basin have demonstrated that anticlines are actively growing into the foreland (Forte et al., 2010, 2013, 2014b; Mosar et al., 2010) into the orogenic sedimentary foreland basin. Shortening rates between 6 and 14\u00a0mm\/y are in agreement with geodetic data. Local shortening represents some 40% (Forte et al., 2013). Together, with information from seismicity and GPS, these latter studies reveal a still actively growing orogenic wedge (Ismail-Zadeh et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n4\nThe Greater Caucasus prior to the Arabia-Eurasia collision\nPrevious works on the geodynamic evolution have largely described and constrained the different paleotectonic domains that existed during Mesozoic-Cenozoic times in the larger Caucasus region (e.g. Adamia et al., 1977; Barrier and Vrielynck, 2008; Dotduyev, 1986; Gamkrelidze, 1986; Golonka, 2004; Kazmin and Tikhonova, 2006; Khain, 1975; Nikishin et al., 2001, 2011; Panov and Lomize, 2007; Popov et al., 2004; Rolland, 2017; Sosson et al., 2010; Vincent et al., 2016). The focus hereafter lies on the paleotectonic and tectonosedimentary domains of the former southern part of the Eurasian continental plate, i.e. its southern margin and more specifically the Greater Caucasus Basin (Fig. 7\n). The proposed paleotectonic reconstruction is a semi-quantitative restoration, based on our new regional section (Fig. 6) and on map information. We suggest that the structural inheritence from the paleotectonic setting determines the future nappe tectonics and development of distinct domains similarly as proposed in Mosar et al. (2010) and Egan et al. (2009) in the Eastern Greater Caucasus. Unlike numerous previously published basin reconstruction, we here propose a semi-quantitavely length balanced reconstruction, based on length\/width and thicknesses that are taken from our section. We also use a concept of rift formation associated with asymmetric development of tilted blocks above listric faults and the formation of two rift shoulders (see also Mosar, 2003). The reconstruction proposed herein is at scale, and tries to apply realistic crustal\/lithospheric dimensions.\nThe area situated north of the Lesser Caucasian-Pontian active margin, i.e. in a back-arc position (Adamia et al., 2011; Ershov et al., 2003; Golonka, 2004; Nikishin et al., 2001; Zonenshain and LePichon, 1986), consisted of a system of NW-SE trending extensional (thinned-crust) basins separated by basement horsts (Trifonov and Sokolov, 2014) and flanked by shelf-like platforms (Adamia et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2011; Dotduyev, 1986) showed the distribution of the main facies types including reefal complexes and associated this setting to the existence of two similar basin margins, to the north and to the south (Dotduyev, 1986). During the Early Cenozoic, the combined current territory of Georgia and the bordering Russian North Caucasus extended from the Lesser Caucasian volcanic arc to the south to the Scythian Platform to the north. It comprised two deep-marine intracontinental extensional basins with tilted block margin geometries, whose late Cenozoic tectonic inversion gave rise to the GC and Ajara-Trialeti mountain ranges (Mosar et al., 2010; Saintot et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2016; Yilmaz et al., 2014). The GC Basin developed, as did subsequently the GC FTB, between the Scythian Platform to the north and the Transcaucasian Dzirula-Shatsky (Georgian) block to the south.\nSince the Triassic, the Dzirula-Shatsky block formed a relatively uplifted shelf-like unit that flanked the GC Basin to the south (Vincent et al., 2016). The basement of this block is exposed as the present Dzirula Massif in Central Georgia and has been at near surface since the Late Paleozoic, indicated by unconformably onlapping Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and volcaniclastics (Adamia et al., 2011; Mayringer et al., 2011; Vincent et al., 2016; Gamkrelidze and Shengelia, 2005). During the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic, the southern shelf of the GC Basin shallow-water is characterized predominantly by carbonate sedimentation (Adamia et al., 2011; Vincent et al., 2016) accompanied during the Middle Jurassic by an important subduction-related andesitic and basaltic volcanism (Mengel et al., 1987). The Dzirula-Shatsky block retained its carbonate platform character throughout the Upper Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleocene, and Early Eocene, exemplified by Upper Jurassic coral-dominated reefs that developed on its northern margin (Guo et al., 2011) and nummulitic limestones that accumulated on it in a shallow warm-water environment during most of the Ypresian and Lutetian times (Lygina et al., 2016). The northern margin of the Dzirula-Shatsky block is considered as a distinct zone, the Gagra-Java zone, characterized by the deposition of a thick island arc volcaniclastics interval during Bajocian times (Adamia et al., 2011) thought to be derived from the southren margin. The large Racha-Lechkhumi Fault separates the Gagra-Java zone from the Dzirula-Shatsky block and can be considered a bouding fault of a major tilted block at the southern margin of the GC Basin (s.l.) which has been inverted during alpine deformation. Cretaceous to Eocene intra-arc rifting separated the Dzirula-Shatsky block from the Lesser Caucasian (Artvin-Bolnisi and Somkheto-Karabakh) continental fragment, opening the deep-marine Ajara-Trialeti Basin (Adamia et al., 2011; Yilmaz et al., 2014). Thus, the isolated position of the Dzirula-Shatsky shelf between the GC Basin to the north and the Ajara-Trialeti basins and the Eastern Black Sea to the south explains the scarcity of siliciclastic material deposited there (Vincent et al., 2016).\nThe southern continental shelf of the Scythian Platform bordered the GC Basin to the north during the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic (Fig. 7; Adamia et al., 2011; Adamia and Zakariadze, 2011; Ershov et al., 2003). Here, deposition of shallow-water siliciclastic sediments derived from the East European platform to the north dominated during Jurassic to Eocene times (Vincent et al., 2016). Coal lenses are a commonly observed feature in siliciclastics of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian. Upper Jurassic coral reefs bordered the southern edge of the Scythian Platform shelf that are well preserved in the western GC (Dotduyev, 1986; Guo et al., 2011). During the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian, the western and especially the eastern domain of the Scythian shelf developed as a lagoon environment where deposition of evaporites occurred (Dotduyev, 1986; Mikhailov et al., 1999; Sobornov, 1996). The present Laba-Malka homoclinal zone in front of the Central GC corresponds to the uplifted southern margin of the Scythian Platform (Adamia et al., 2011; Khain, 1975; Sobornov, 1996; Yilmaz et al., 2014). This questa dominated landscape reaches up to altidues of 3000\u00a0m. a.s.l. Its complex, multiphase, basement is exposed as the Pre-Mesozoic units of the Bechasyn zone and the Fore Range (Gamkrelidze and Shengelia, 2005; Somin, 2011) and is overlain unconformably and in a generally northward onlapping manner by the Mesozoic shallow-water sediments of the continental shelf domain (Pismennyi et al., 2004). The basement of the Scythian Platform is characterized by a succession of inherited horst-and-graben paleostructures, e.g. the Fore Range that represents a Late Paleozoic depocenter between the then elevated Main Range and Bechasyn blocks and that was filled with Devonian to Permian volcano-sedimentary clastics (Upper Paleozoic \u201cmolasse\u201d) (Somin, 2011). We consider the Pshekish-Tyrnyauz Fault as the northern boundary of the GC Basin given that the present Main Range features Lower-Middle Jurassic marine siliciclastics squeezed in narrow graben-synclines between the pre-Mesozoic basement blocks (Khain, 1975, 1984; Trifonov and Sokolov, 2014). Furthermore, the occurrence of Middle Jurassic dolerite sills and dykes, gabbroic and granitic batholiths (Somin, 2011), and MORB-like effusive rocks in the Main Range indicate that it pertained rather to the extensional basin domain than to the bordering platform domain or that it formed, at least, the basin-shelf transition, developing in a thinned continental crust.\nIn the light of the above-described pre-collisional tectonic setting, we interpret the Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic GC Basin at the latitude of the Georgian Military Road as an asymmetric rifted intracontinental basin of passive margin-type with numerous separate crustal blocks interpreted to be formed by crsutal-scale listric tilted blocks and associated half-grabens (Kalberguenova et al., 2018). The listric fault half-graben geometry is recognize from profiles in the northern GC and can be deduced from outcrop exposures in the central uplifted pre-Mesozoic basement. The detailed geometry of the paleotectonic structures in the main GC basin remains largely unknown and we here propose a classic listric fault driven tilted-block and halfgraben geometry.\nThe extension induced by the back-arc rifting intensely thinned the continental crust underlying the GC Basin, leading to partial melting of the asthenosphere and development of associated MORB-like tholeiitic magmatism during the Middle Jurassic. During the Alpine stage, subsequent to the Late Eocene-Oligocene Arabia-Eurasia collision, the rifted and tilted blocks were structurally inverted along the listric normal faults that were reactivated as south-directed thrusts hence developing the Southern Slope imbricate fan. The main crustal detachment fault was reactivated as a deep-seated low-angle thrust in the subsurface of the East Georgian GC. These major faults host the bulk of the deformation associated with the GC development and remain active, as exemplified by earthquake focal mechanisms and ongoing seismicity identified along the thrust interpreted in our tectonic cross section (Fig. 6; Tan and Taymaz, 2006; Legendre et al., 2017). The frontal part of the Southern Slope zone, complicated by numerous thrust slices and characterized by tectonic-gravitational mixtite (linked to inverted crustal tilted blocks), is restored as the junction between the Transcaucasian Dzirula-Shatsky basement block (including the Gagra-Java zone) and the deep flysch basin with thinned crust (Leonov, 2016). The MCT represents a reactivated major extensional fault that was in proximity to the axis of the basin, i.e. where the continental crust was the most thinned, due to the local accumulation of crustal extension-related magmatic features (batholiths, dolerite sills\/dykes, and pillow lavas). Recent dating of shear zones along the MCT indicate Jurassic ages (190-135\u00a0Ma) and corroborate our interpretation (Vasey et al., 2020).\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nExtensive fieldwork combined with a compilation of existing data, along the Georgian-Russian military road and in the near vicinity, made it possible to re-assess the tectonic architecture of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. A new compiled and revised geological-tectonic map allowed us to revisit, and locally re-define the major structural units and their relevance in both the paleotectonic and alpine tectonic setting.\nThe Greater Caucasus is an actively propagating doubly verging fold-and-thrust belt resulting from the tectonic inversion of a Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic intracontinental rift. This Greater Caucasus Basin initiated during the Lower Jurassic and evolved into a hyperextended continental lithospheric basin in the southern Eurasia margin as a consequence of Mesozoic extensional tectonics induced and controlled by the northward Neotethys subduction located to the south (Cimmerian stage). As such the basin evolved in a back-arc setting north of the active margin of the Lesser Caucasus. The continued Arabia-Eurasia convergence and subsequent collision in the Late Eocene-Oligocene led to the closure of this deep marine basin, resulting in the inversion of the inherited extensional structures and formation of important underthrusting and stacking of tectonic units (Alpine stage) and the formation of an important orogenic wedge.\nOur study along the Georgian Military Road (Eastern Georgia - North Ossetia-Alania) highlights the tectonic units and confirms the doubly verging structure that builds up the eastern Central Greater Caucasus fold-and-thrust belt. Thus, the pro-wedge of the orogen comprises the south-verging Southern Slope imbricate fan (deformed Mesozoic-Early Cenozoic basin fill) whose active deformation front reaches far to the south into the post-Eocene Kartli foreland basin, which itself evolved from a purely flexural stage into a wedge top setting. The Transcaucasian Dzirula-Shatsky block is actively underthrusting the Greater Caucasus orogen. The retro-wedge of the north GC incorporates, from the core of the mountain belt (basin axis) to its hinterland (Scythian Platform), the Main Range, a triangular-shaped structure uplifted along the Main Caucasus thrust, and the Northern Slope duplex stack that wedged to the north creating the homoclinal structure that is characteristic of the central North Caucasus.\nDetailed structural investigation allowed us to document and confirm the thrust and fold geometry and the associated kinematics. The regional fold trend and thrust orientation is W-E to WNW-ESE. South of the basement units of the Main Range, the main transport direction is top-to-the south with an important shear component that can be recognized in a strain concentration in the major thrust zones, and regionally also by a gentle reorientation of fold axes into the transport direction. Associated with the fold development, a slaty cleavage develops under low-grade metamorphic conditions, espacially in the domains of the Southern Slope.\nWe restored the present tectonic units of the Greater Caucasus to their pre-collisional counterparts in a rifted basin setting, characterized by numerous tilted basement blocks, between what was the Scythian Platform shelf to the north and the Dzirula-Shatsky shelf to the south. Accordingly, the units of the Southern Slope imbricate fan spanned the southern portion of the Greater Caucasus basin from the Dzirula-Shatsky horst to the south to the axial part of the basin to the north. The Lower-Middle Jurassic basaltic magmatic basin axis is preserved as the southernmost portion of the Main Range zone today. The Main Range and the Northern Slope are interpreted as the portion of the basin located to the north of the basin axis, hence forming the transition towards the Scythian Platform shelf. Major thrusts of the orogen (e.g. Main Caucasus Thrust, Pshekish-Tyrnyauz Fault, and Racha-Lechkhumi Fault) correspond to inherited, normal listric detachments of the former extensional rift, that were reactivated as reverse faults during the Alpine inversion stage. The MCT is thus a major, and still active, structure separating the core and northern slopes of the GC orogen from the southern slopes, as well as a major inherited, extensional fault located in the GC basin center.\nIntegrating existing data, densified by fieldwork, made it possible to propose a new unified tectonic map of the area of investigation, which subsequently allowed us to propose a new paleotectectonic model, based on modern understanding of rift formation.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nJon Mosar: Supervision, conceptualization, project management, investigation, fieldwork, writing, review, editing, visualizazion, J\u00e9r\u00e9miah Mauvill: Investigation, fieldwork, writing, visualizazion, data curation.

Evidence of leakage is common, and it is frequently observed on seismic data (Andresen et al., 2011; Arts et al., 2004; Cartwright and Huuse, 2005; Foschi and Cartwright, 2016; L\u00f8seth et al., 2009). However, case studies using detailed analysis of the associated expressions of hydrocarbon anomalies to understand the leakage path and origin are relatively few (Foschi and Cartwright, 2020).\nThe most common seismic evidence of leakage from topseals is probably that of gas chimneys (Judd and Hovland, 1992; Heggland, 1997, 1998). Gas chimneys were known in the industry back in the 50's although well-known examples were published in the 80's in association with the discovery of large oil fields in the Central Graben of the Norwegian North Sea (e.g., Munns, 1985). Of the various early definitions of gas chimneys, we adopt in this study that proposed by Heggland (1997), who described gas chimneys as zones of seismic disturbance characterised by distortion of amplitudes and phase of the background reflectivity (Heggland, 1997). The interest in gas chimneys as evidence of leakage, combined with the strong deterioration of the seismic imaging that accompanies their geophysical detection, allowed several theories to be postulated in the last 30 years. An incomplete and brief list of works addressing the significance of gas chimneys in chronological order is then presented below.\nIn 1998, Bjorkum (1998) theorized gas chimneys as a form of exsolution of gas escaping in solution from hydrocarbon fields. The mechanism invoked was related to the fact that water can move across capillary barriers (even at irreducible water saturations, Teige et al., 2005) and that a substantial proportion of gas can therefore move in-solution across the caprock and exsolve due to pressure drop above the seal. In the following year, Granli et al. (1999), in an early attempt to improve the imaging across gas chimneys, showed that the analysed gas cloud from the Tommeliten gas field was emplaced by migration of free phase gas leaking across the caprock, but via fault-related conduits.\nA few years later L\u00f8seth (2002) postulated that gas chimneys above the Gullfaks South Field were formed by hydraulic fracturing of the seal and added, therefore, in the mechanism of their formation a condition of overpressure. The author reached this conclusion because of the high pore-fluid pressure and thermogenic gas concentration encountered within the drilled chimney with respect to nearby offset wells (L\u00f8seth, 2002). The combination of (i)high pressure, (ii)generation of fractures and (iii)formation of gas chimneys was then studied in the following years. Arntsen et al. (2007), among others, modelled the gas chimney above the Tommeliten Alpha field as a fracture network filled with gas. The imaging resulting from the seismic forward modelling was comparable with the seismic response from the real analogue.\n\nHeggland (2005, 2013) then recognised that the position and the geometry of gas chimneys could reflect the location of seal failure and that using these observations the interpreter could increase the rate of discoveries. Bello et al. (2017) extended Heggland's (2005) work in trying to address the presence of high pressure within gas chimneys. The authors concluded that, within a population of about 80 examples, only a subset of the analysed gas chimneys was indeed associated with a condition of overpressure. That study demonstrated that overpressure might not be related to gas chimneys but could not address whether a condition of overpressure was present before, or during, leakage.\nBack with the same line of research of Arntsen et al. (2007), Rubino et al. (2011) presented a geological model composed of patchy distribution of CO2 in stacked layers but without a fracture network. The seismic output resulting from the forward modelling was very similar to previously reported gas cloud observed on seismic data (e.g., Arts et al., 2004). On the same line of research of Granli et al. (1999), instead, Warner et al. (2013) demonstrated that the gas chimney above the Tommeliten Alpha structure (same example as in Arntsen et al., 2007) was consistent with poorly resolved layers charged with gas. The results, based on anisotropic full-waveform inversion techniques, were in line with the models proposed by Rubino et al. (2011), indicating stacked gas-charged reservoir and no fractures.\nLater, Foschi et al. (2014) reinterpreted about 50 gas chimneys from the Falkland Plateau Basin, as stacked gas-related amplitude anomalies, and called these features vertical anomaly clusters (VACs). The interpretational framework, consistent with the works of Rubino et al. (2011) and Warner et al. (2013) allowed a more systematic analysis of these leakage phenomena. Moreover, the interpretational approach raised the potential to define the migration mechanism based on the distribution and characteristics of the anomalies composing VACs (Foschi et al., 2014). Foschi et al. (2018) applied the VAC-related type of analysis to stacked gas reservoirs belonging to gas chimneys from offshore Netherlands (Blocks A and B). The cross-stratal migration responsible for the formation of the documented VACs, reconstructed using the centroids of the constituent stacked anomalies, was demonstrated to occur in a specific region within the common centre of the VACs. In Foschi et al. (2018) an overpressure of the gas phase (capillary pressure) was assumed to be necessary to overcome the capillary entry pressure of the seals in between the reservoirs but not necessarily as such to fracture the overburden (Foschi et al., 2018).\nIn this study, we analyse a large gas chimney above the Marjoram Gas Field, offshore NW Borneo (Fig. 2\n\n, inset). We apply and test the same interpretational framework as used for the analysis of stacked gas reservoirs documented by Foschi et al. (2018). We analyse the geometry of leakage in relation to overburden and seal characteristics and where the gas provenance is demonstrability linked to the reservoir underneath. We interpret the gas chimney as a structure characterised by an organised distribution of gas in layers (c.f. Rubino et al., 2012; Warner et al., 2013) and consistent with VAC's type mode of gas migration (Bertoni et al., 2018; Foschi et al., 2014, 2018).\nThe aim of this study is to demonstrate a rigorous method of defining the dominant leakage pathway and mechanism above the Marjoram Gas Field. The methods applied in this work, based on centroid and other analyses (c.f. Foschi et al., 2018), show that gas migrates vertically along faults but that the across-strata migration demonstrably focusses into a narrow central corridor of a fault array that also intersects the reservoir of the Marjoram Gas Field beneath. The workflow used in this study can be integrated into seal assessment workflows applied to oil and gas fields, but also to subsurface storage of CO2.\n\n1.1\nConceptual background to centroid analysis\nAs experimentally demonstrated, the injection and spreading of a non-miscible fluid into a fully saturated homogenous horizontal media (e.g., methane or CO2 in water-wet reservoir) produces a sub-circular region (e.g., Zhao et al., 2016) whose centroid, the arithmetic mean of the point-coordinates of that region, approximately matches with the location of the injection point (Foschi et al., 2018). Similarly, the centroid of a sub-circular gas accumulation, interpreted for instance on seismic data, under specific circumstances, can provide the location of the injection of gas into the observed host formation (Foschi et al., 2018) (Fig. 1A). If the fluid conforms to structure (stratigraphic or fault trap) or the fluid is injected within a dipping reservoir (e.g., Luo et al., 2011), or the injection of gas occurs next to, or at, an impermeable barrier, such as a sealing fault, the centroid, resulting by the geometry of the gas accumulation, do not match the injection points (Fig. 1A).\nWhen the migration process occurs across multiple reservoirs, such as in VACs, the positions of the centroids of the constituent gas accumulations provide the position, and the geometry, of the three-dimensional (3-D) migration pathway (Foschi et al., 2018) (Fig. 1B). The pathway can be related to a region of focussed migration across the porous media (capillary invasion), expressed as vertical distribution of centroids, or to a dipping conduit, such as a fault, where centroids are distributed following the dip of the conduit. Multiple trends of centroids highlights multiple conduits (Fig. 1B).\n\n\n\n2\nData and methods\nThe database used in this study is a combination of 3-D dual-azimuth broadband seismic data and well data. The seismic data were acquired by Sarawak Shell Berhad in 2012 and cover an area of 3100\u00a0km2 (Fig. 2, inset). The data volume is characterised by a bin size of 25\u00a0m and a sampling interval of 4\u00a0ms. The data was processed using a sequence suitable for preserving low frequencies and was finalised using American polarity \u2013 an increase of acoustic impedance contrast is characterised by a positive reflection coefficient (RC\u00a0+\u00a0Peak). The dominant frequency is 40\u201345\u00a0Hz (within the first 2\u00a0s TWT below the seabed) and yields a seismic resolution of \u223c10\u00a0m (c.f. Widess, 1973).\nThe well data comprises logs measured after the drilling of the two boreholes Marjoram-1 and Marjoram-2 (Fig. 2). The well data include gamma-ray, resistivity, sonic, and density logs, among others. The well database includes also well reports, inclusive of cuttings and lithological description of the encountered formations, fluid samples analysis, pressure data (pressure tests), and leak-off tests (LOTs). Shell International BV made these reports and other supporting information available, including depth-to-time converted surfaces of the main stratigraphic horizons and cultural data (e.g., coastline, license blocks and field outlines).\nThe methods used in this work comprise standard reflection seismic interpretation and amplitude extraction, on both amplitude and variance attribute, using Schlumberger's Petrel software, and geometrical analysis tools. These tools, including the centroid analysis (c.f. Foschi et al., 2018), have been developed in Mathworks's Matlab. A simple time-to-depth conversion of key horizons was performed using a one-dimensional (1-D) interval velocity function consisting of two layers, water (1500\u00a0m\/s) and overburden (1600\u00a0m\/s). The latter was estimated from well logs and check-shot tables.\n\n\n3\nThe central Luconia province\nThe Central Luconia province is bounded to the East by the West Baram Delta and to the West by the West Luconia and the East Natuna basins. A structural lineament known as the West Baram Line bounds the eastern margin of Central Luconia and separates the province from the West Baram Delta (Fig. 2, inset; Doust, 1981). Bathymetrically, the Central Luconia province exhibits a flat seabed surface dipping gently to NE and characterised by a water depth of about 200\u00a0m. In the north-eastern portion of the Central Luconia, a NW-SE oriented slope reflects the structural change from the Central Luconia to the adjacent West Baram Delta (Epting, 1980). The study area and the Marjoram Gas Field are located along this structural lineament (Fig. 2, inset).\nThe Cenozoic sedimentary column of the Central Luconia is characterized by a total thickness of about 2500\u00a0m (Fig. 3\nA). The sedimentary package towards the North of the province is divided into 8 cycles (I to VIII) with age ranging from Eocene to the Present. Each cycle is regressive and is separated by transgressive stages (Ko\u0161a, 2015). The occurrence of carbonate features, such as carbonate build-ups and platforms, is observed throughout the sedimentary package, however during the Middle to Late Miocene (Cycle IV-V) the basin experienced a major period of carbonate deposition (Epting, 1980). Carbonate pinnacles and mega platforms developed mostly in the central and northernmost portions of Central Luconia with thick edifices spanning the entire sedimentary column (>2000 m). The carbonate build-ups are characterised by transgressive to high-stand carbonate facies. The margins of the major platforms and pinnacles are generally composed of high-energy formations, such as coral framestone. The internal facies are instead generally more mud-dominated limestone (Lau et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2016). Carbonate build-ups in the southern portion of Central Luconia are more influenced by siliciclastic input (Rankey et al., 2019).\nThe Central Luconia province does not show evidence of tectonic activity after Middle Miocene (Epting, 1980). This condition is reflected by the absence of recent structures in the province and by a negligible anisotropy of the stress field (King et al., 2010). Nevertheless, minor normal faults, related to differential compaction, are often observed along the margins of the carbonate platforms. These affect the immediate formations above the carbonate build-ups and the overburden (see later).\nThe Central Luconia province is a very prolific area with over 65 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of thermogenic gas discovered to date (Janjuhah et al., 2018). The petroleum system is sourced from high-maturity Late Oligocene\/Early Miocene Cycle I coals and terrestrial organic matter (Fig. 3A) (Lau et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2016). The main reservoir targets are represented by over 200 carbonate build-ups (Epting, 1980). The sealing unit is represented by an Upper Miocene \u2013 Pliocene shale-rich package (Cycles IV to VI) (Fig. 3A) (Lau et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2016).\nThe seal unit includes thief-sand intervals mainly within the upper Cycle V (Lunt and Madon, 2017). The Marjoram Gas Field, which represents the focus of this study, is a 2.4 TCF gas field (P50; gas initially in place) located to the NE of Central Luconia (Fig. 2 inset). The two wells Marjoram-1 and Marjoram-2 were drilled in 2014 and 2016 respectively, and gas composition is consistent with a wet-gas mixture.\n\n\n4\nGeological and geophysical observations\n\n4.1\nReservoir\nThe Marjoram reservoir consist of a Post-Mid Miocene (Cycle IV) reefal carbonate (Lau et al., 2014; Mehta et al., 2016). The lithology of the reservoir is consistent with clean limestone with just a 20\u00a0m bed of muddy limestone (marl) towards the top of the interval (Fig. 4\n). Analysis of log data confirms a porosity range for the \u2018cleaner\u2019 carbonate facies of 0.20\u20130.25 and importantly no barriers\/baffles are present within the carbonate reservoir section (i.e., net-to-gross\u00a0=\u00a01). The hydrocarbon saturation is about 0.82 (water saturation, Sw\u00a0=\u00a00.18) (Fig. 4).\nPressure data collected during the drilling of Marjoram-1 (Fig. 4) and Marjoram-2 is consistent with continuous gas columns of 188\u00a0m and 167\u00a0m, respectively. The total column from the GWC to the crest of the pinnacle is 455\u00a0m. Formation pressure testing revealed that the reservoir is \u223c0.8\u00a0MPa above hydrostatic. The geofluids within the reservoir section exhibit a \u201cwet\u201d composition dominated by methane and other light hydrocarbon phases (methane 55% by weight).\n\n\n4.2\nSeal and overburden\nThe overburden, the sedimentary interval from the ToC to the seabed, constitutes the sealing formation of the Marjoram Gas Field. The overburden encompasses the entire sedimentary column from Cycles IV to VIII (Fig. 3A) with a total thickness of about 1130\u00a0ms TWT, or about 900\u00a0m (using an interval velocity of 1600\u00a0m\/s; Fig. 3). Above the Marjoram Gas Field, the overburden exhibits two contrasting seismic facies here called Units 1 and 2 (Fig. 3B).\nUnit 1 extends from the seabed to a \u201cV\u201d shaped erosional surface, called here \u201cV horizon\u201d, located at about 370\u00a0ms TWT below seabed (or 300\u00a0m; Fig. 3B). Unit 1 exhibits seismic facies dominated by bright undulating reflections characterised by anomalies of both positive and negative response (Fig. 3B). The seismic facies is consistent with vertically stacked 20\u201350\u00a0m thick mass-transport deposits, and oriented perpendicular to the shelf break (direction of sediment flow): approximately NE. Unit 1, based on cuttings from Marjoram-2, is composed of interbedded shale, silt and minor sand lenses, the latter occasionally overpressured.\nUnit 2 extends from the V Horizon to the ToC (Fig. 3B). The average thickness above the Marjoram gas Field is in the order of 600\u00a0m. Seismically, Unit 2 is predominantly composed by parallel reflections characterised by low to moderate amplitude response (Fig. 3B). This second unit, based on cuttings from Marjoram-1, is composed of shaly claystone with interbedded minor thin siltstone layers. Gamma-ray logs show relatively high readings with values in the order of 100 API (Fig. 3B) and minor heterogeneities.\n\n4.2.1\nStructural features\nA network of normal faults transects Unit 2 from the immediate top reservoir to the top of Unit 2 (Figs. 3B and 5\n). The faults in the network dip to SE at about 50\u201360\u00b0 (Fig. 3B). The fault system is poorly resolved within the gas cloud, so a tentative reconstruction of the faults above the crest of the reservoir was carried out by mapping discontinuities observed on amplitude maps (Fig. 5A, inset). Variance attribute was also used to highlight continuity of the individual horizons and fault segments. The result of this analysis, shown on two representative surfaces at the middle and the base of the gas cloud (Fig. 5B and C, respectively), shows that the faults in the network are characterized by lengths in the order of a few kilometres and spacing of a few hundred meters (Fig. 5A). The fault network is oriented mainly N\u2013S and runs parallel to the eastern flank of the carbonate pinnacle hosting the Marjoram Gas Field (Fig. 5B, rose diagram).\nA major fault, named here \u201cF-100\u201d, transects the overburden and the reservoir along the eastern portion of the carbonate build-up hosting the Marjoram Gas field, from North to South. Fault F-100 is continuous at the shallow section (Fig. 5B) although clear gas-related distortions are visible within the core of the gas cloud (Fig. 5B, \u201cd.\u201c). The fault, and the reflectivity in general, at depth, are obscured by the prominent gas cloud (Fig. 5C). The lack of imaging and signal deterioration preclude us to assess whether the fault is a continuous feature or composed of linked segments.\nF-100, and the main NNE-SSW fault system, are currently inactive as all the encountered fault tips terminate at the top of Unit 2 (Fig. 3B).\n\n\n4.2.2\nTrap capacity and seal strength\nThe structural relief of the trap, from the spill-point to the top of the pinnacle is about 500\u00a0m. The Marjoram Gas Field is then underfilled by 40\u201350\u00a0m. The strength of the seal (overburden), evaluated using leak-off tests performed during the drilling of Marjoram-1 and Marjoram-2, is characterised by a fracture closing pressure (FCP) gradient of 16.4\u00a0kPa\/m (Fig. 4, pressure plots). The FCP gradient was reconstructed using well formation test data retrieved within a window of 500\u00a0m above the ToC and so are representative of the portion of the intact seal hosting the gas cloud. The extrapolation of the gas gradients, retrieved from pressure and fluid density information from Marjoram-1 and Marjoram-2 (Fig. 4), reveals that at the crest of the carbonate pinnacle, located at 1768\u00a0m TVDSS, the pressure exerted by the gas column within the reservoir is approximately equal to FCP. The Marjoram Gas Field is at, or very close to, its top seal's FCP limit (Fig. 4), and is likely to be leaking hydrocarbons at present.\n\n\n\n4.3\nVertical anomaly cluster\nThe gas chimney above the Marjoram Gas Field is clearly identifiable as a region of seismic amplification and distortion of reflectivity relative to the off-structure background (Fig. 3B, inset). This leakage feature has an irregular volume that crudely enclose a 3-D stack of elliptical shapes in map view and is entirely hosted within Unit 2 (Fig. 3B). The root of the gas chimney is at the crest of the carbonate pinnacle, which is in the SW of the gas field (GWC; Fig. 2). The gas chimney, interpretable as a vertical anomaly cluster (VAC, c. f. Foschi et al., 2014) has been divided into 10s of amplitude anomalies (see Data and Methods). The clearest interpretable anomalies, 12 in total, have each been individually included in this study and analysed.\n\n4.3.1\nAmplitude anomalies: acoustic description\nThe anomalies composing the VAC above the Marjoram Gas Field are soft in polarity and characterised by an acoustic amplification (in arbitrary amplitude units) around three times the background value (Fig. 6\n, inset). The amplification is interpreted to be related to the gas expelled by the underlying field and similar to the normal expression of amplifications attributable to free gas observed on seismic data (e.g., Sheriff, 1975). The amplification within the amplified zones is heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a ceiling amplitude response is observed within the strongest amplified regions (see acoustic impedance around 33000 in Fig. 6 inset). This lack of variation of amplitude in the high value range is interpreted to be caused by the lack of sensitivity of the seismic reflection response to variations of gas saturation (c.f. Domenico, 1974).\nMost of the anomalies observed within the VACs are characterised by a sharp decrease of amplitude at their centres (Fig. 6, question marks). This characteristic is interpreted to be caused by transmission artefacts (c.f. Sheriff, 1975) deriving from the ray paths through the shallower amplitude anomalies composing the VAC (Fig. 2B) and described in gas chimneys elsewhere (e.g., Arts et al., 2004; Arntsen et al., 2007; Foschi et al., 2018). The decrease of amplitude at the centre of the AAs is prominent at the basal anomalies, such as AA-100, where a continuous interpretation across the centre of the VAC is not possible (Fig. 6). Nevertheless, the free-gas regions responsible for the resulting anomalies are interpreted to be continuous across the attenuated regions (Fig. 6, insets, blue area\/contour).\n\n\n4.3.2\nAmplitude anomalies: geometrical description\nThe geometrical description of the amplitude anomalies was based on the shape of their outer margins extracted at the interpreted amplitude cut-off (e.g., Fig. 6, insets). The amplitude cut-off was evaluated for each anomaly by defining background and amplified regimes. The exact threshold amplitude was calculated in the middle of the two defined average regimes. This method allowed to overcome the issue of local acoustic impedance ranges and local amplifications. The areas of the margins were further simplified and added to that of their respective central attenuated areas (Fig. 6, insets). These final combined margins and central area maps have then been used for geometrical and centroid analyses (Fig. 7\n).\nThe 12 anomalies exhibit an areal extent from 0.1 to 6.0\u00a0km2 and are crudely elliptical in shape (their eccentricities measured using approximate axes lengths averages \u223c0.8). The area of the anomalies is affected by both structural elements (e.g., AA-420, shown later) and partial illumination (e.g., AA-250, Fig. 7, inset). These factors produce an unclear variation of area with depth. Nevertheless, the variation in area from anomaly AA-450 to AA-800 is small (std\u00a0=\u00a00.55). The distribution of the anomalies within the VAC is asymmetric. The anomalies located towards the top of the VAC are located to the SW with respect to the basal anomaly AA-100 (Fig. 7). Although this result will be explored more in detail with the centroid analysis it is worth noting here that the diagonally-offset distribution of the anomalies composing the VAC is different from previously reported analysis of stacked anomalies (Foschi et al., 2018), but also different from typical gas chimneys (Arntsen et al., 2007; Bello et al., 2017) and CCS related carbon dioxide clouds (e.g., Arts et al., 2004).\nThe juxtaposition of (1) the amplitude maps and calculated margins with (2) the depth contours of the relative time-to-depth converted host reflections (see Data and Methods), reveals that the anomalies do not precisely conform to structure. By looking at Fig. 8\n (and accompanying Fig. 5A) AA-600 does not fill the shallower portion of the structure located at the footwall of F-100 and diverges with respect to the depth contour by about 20\u201325\u00a0m (Fig. 8, inset). The lack of conformity to structure could be related to lithological variation within the host units (small-scale stratigraphic trapping) or to a dynamic state of the gas in place or to velocity anomalies in the overburden. The application of a 1-D velocity model for conversion from time to depth could also be insufficient to resolve the exact geometry of the overburden and verify whether the anomalies conform to structure.\n\n\n4.3.3\nAmplitude anomalies and faults\nThe 12 anomalies are all transected by the NNE-SSW oriented normal faults that cut the overburden hosting the VAC (Figs. 3B and 5). The amplitude amplification of the anomalies is continuous across the fault intersection towards the centre of the VAC (e.g., Figs. 6 and 8). This condition suggests that minor faults do not produce a flow barrier for the spreading of gas within the faulted host formations (discussed later). Far from the centre of the anomalies the margins are instead characterised by a sharper, planar offset pattern (e.g., Fig. 6). This evidence implies that fault displaces the hosting media but that the gas phase keeps hydraulic conductivity across the fault.\nConversely, larger faults, such as F-100, seem instead to affect the extent of a number of anomalies at the centre of the VAC by cross-fault sealing (see Fig. 7, inset). Specifically, F-100 bounds anomalies AA-400 to AA-450, in that they are present mainly within the hanging wall of this fault (e.g., AA-400, Fig. 9\n), and anomalies AA-500 and AA-540 whose shapes are shifted sinistrally with respect to the portion of the anomalies belonging to the footwall block (e.g., AA-500, Fig. 10\n). This evidence suggests that F-100 acts partially as barrier for lateral gas flow and affects the morphology of the VAC at its centre.\n\n\n4.3.4\nCentroid analysis\nThe centroids of the amplitude anomalies were calculated using the outline shapes (Foschi et al., 2018), i.e. the margins only and neglecting variations of amplitude, attenuations, and loss of signal within the anomalies (e.g., Fig. 6, blue contour). The position of the centroids was also evaluated in relation to structural features, such as faults. The centroid analysis is presented firstly with reference to two representative anomalies, AA-500 and AA-430, whose centroids are located at the centre of their simplified margins (Figs. 10 and 11\n).\nAnomaly AA-500 (Fig. 10) exhibits attenuation and other transmission artefacts but is roughly subcircular in shape. Because of this shape we interpret that the spreading of gas was not influenced by structural barriers and that the centroid can be interpreted as the point, or region, subject to gas injection into the mapped horizon. For anomaly AA-500 the interpreted injection point is also placed a few 10s of meters distant from the interpreted fault F-100 (Fig. 9). This close distance, between the interpreted injection point and the fault F-100, suggests that the latter might act as the region of gas injection into the host horizon.\nConversely, anomaly AA-450 (Fig. 11) is characterised by semi-circular shape indicating that gas was not able to spread in all directions. In this case the shape is affected by fault F-100 and the centroid is not interpreted as the injection point. For anomaly AA-450 the locus of gas injection could be placed anywhere between the actual centroid and fault F-100. Because AA-450 is part of a stack of anomalies the position of the injection point will be evaluated later once all other centroids are presented (see Discussion).\nWe then extend the centroid analysis and interpretation to all 12 anomalies and integrated the centroid distribution against the position of the crest of the reservoir, the fault network (interpreted towards the top of the VAC), and the GWC of the Marjoram Gas Field. The centroids of 3 anomalies, namely AA-200, AA-250 and AA-630, presented in the results, were discounted from the analysis and discussion because of their interpretation was only partial (Fig. 7, inset).\nThe result of the centroid analysis for the entire stack of anomalies (Fig. 12\n) shows that 12 centroids are in an area around, and to the East, of the crest of the reservoir (C, Fig. 12). The centroids follow a NE-SW oriented trend with an R2 of \u223c0.4. By removing the centroids of the partially interpreted anomalies (Fig. 7, inset) the R2 increases to 0.8 (55\u00b0N). The centroids are clearly spread along a \u223c1.8\u00a0km long corridor characterised by a trapezoidal geometry on map view. Importantly, the depth of the centroids decreases systematically from NE, at the base of the VAC (AA-100), to SW, at the top of the VAC (AA-800). This specific geometry defines then a clear inclined track from the base to the top of the VAC and rising to the SW. This pathway is interpreted to be the potential locus of the successive gas injection points for the formation of the VAC (see Discussion).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nSignificance of the distribution of centroids\nIn Foschi et al. (2018) the (1)focused distribution of injection points within a narrow, vertical, columnar volume, (2)the relatively simple horizontal geometry of the host formations, and (3)the lack of structures, implied the presence of a vertical central region of focused fluid flow connecting several stacked reservoirs in vertical succession (vertical conduit, Fig. 1). The 9 selected injection points mapped above the Marjoram Gas Field are instead distributed along a plunging corridor (Fig. 11) whose root, here assumed to be the deepest centroid (belonging to AA-100), is located close to the crest of the reservoir and the location where F-100 intersects the ToC (Fig, 11). This specific distribution implies the presence of a preferential pathway which could be related to a fault, or several faults.\nThe presence of structural features within the overburden, in particular fault F-100 (e.g., Fig. 8) could have provided a preferential migration pathway for the formation of the VAC and is the simplest interpretation of the evidence. A more complex pathway whereby free gas flows via several pathways (c.f., Arntsen et al., 2007), not necessarily linked to fault F-100, could still take place. Nevertheless, the high R2 resulting from the mapped injection points suggests that a single conduit is responsible for the migration of gas.\nBased on the argument above, the injection points of anomalies AA-400, AA-420, and AA-450 could be relocated (Fig. 13\nA) or removed from the centroid analysis (Fig. 13B). The first option would see the centroids to move towards the intersection of the anomalies with fault F-100 (the most likely conduit). This relocation could be justified by the fact that some of the centroids are observed to be close to the fault F-100 intersection with the amplitude anomalies (e.g., A-500, Fig. 10). This manipulation of the centroids would increase R2 to 0.88 (43\u00b0N) (Fig. 13A). The second option is instead to exclude the centroids from the centroid analysis. This operation is favored as a clear representation of fault F-100 is not possible within the disturbed region within the core of the VAC. The exclusion of the centroids of anomalies AA-400, AA-420, and AA-450 would increase R2 to 0.94 (45\u00b0N) (Fig. 13B).\n\n\n5.2\nMigration pathway\nThe migration of hydrocarbons across the overburden needs to satisfy certain observations related to the VAC, such as the position of the injection points, the relationship between the anomalies and fault F-100, and other evidence related to the overburden including the structures and the pressure data. Because of poor imaging and lack of detailed knowledge of the permeability structure within and surrounding the conduit region (e.g., damage zone, number of fractures), the migration of gas through the overburden could be achieved either by (1) a combination of cross-stratal and horizontal migration stages (Fig. 13C), or (2) exploiting fault F-100 and the damage zone related to it (Fig. 13D).\nA \u201cstaircase\u201d migration model requires as many stages of cross-stratal migration as stages of fluid flow along strata (Fig. 13C). For the vertical migration ones there must need a sort of conduit region for each step or a condition where the capillary pressure is larger than the capillary entry pressure of the intraformational seal (Berg, 1975). This scenario requires gas anomalies conforming to structure and a sequence of crestal culminations aligned exactly to the linear conduit reconstructed using the centroids. As observed on a representative map related to anomaly AA-650, the anomalies do not conform precisely to structure and the centroids are not placed at the indicated crestal culminations (Fig. 8, inset, c).\nMoreover, within this model, the presence of two crestal areas, at the hanging wall and the footwall of fault F-100 (Fig. 4), should force gas to migrate vertically to two separate crests and result into two groups of stacked anomalies, not just one, as observed. This model seems then implausible; the alternative model is that the conduit belongs mainly to fault F-100 and its damage zone volume and that the individual anomalies composing the VAC are formed by injection of gas from this fault into the intervening host formations (Fig. 13D).\n\n\n5.3\nMechanism of migration\nMigration of hydrocarbons along faults is a challenging problem that have been extensively studied for several decades (Allan, 1989; Aydin, 2000; Smith, 1966). Faults are complex conduits that can activate and allow fluids to migrate along them (e.g., Sibson, 1982) and constitute one of the most important seal by-pass systems for fluid migration across seals (Cartwright et al., 2007). Even during inactive periods faults may retain a permeability structure, that under specific boundary conditions can allow fluid migration (Caine et al., 1996).\nBecause the fault network above the Marjoram Gas Field is no longer active (Fig. 2B) it is excluded that gas migration, and the formation of this large VAC, occurred during fault slip. Therefore, we suggest that fault F-100, and its damage zone, could have been dilated because of large capillary pressure (e.g., Cox, 1995; Grauls et al., 1994). Looking at the reconstructed pressure profile previously presented, the pressure exerted by the long gas column of the Marjoram Gas Field matches the fracture closing pressure of the overburden (Fig. 4, pressure plots). This evidence, as previously anticipated, not only suggests that gas overpressure could have dilated fault F-100 allowing fluids to leak but could also justify that fault F-100 acted as the dominant conduit responsible for all the necessary stages of vertical gas migration to the top of the VAC (Fig. 13D).\nThe emplacement of the large gas cloud, that would then have started from high capillary pressure at the base of the fault (top reservoir), would have then proceeded sequentially, from the base to the top of the VAC. For each intervening host formation, the injection of gas at the observed injection points would have drain water radially emplacing the documented subcircular gas anomalies (Fig. 13D). The migration process occurring in the overburden (Fig. 3), given the large gas column in the reservoir (Fig. 4, pressure plots), could be still ongoing at present.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications\nThe specific distribution of the injection points of the analysed VAC above the Marjoram Gas Field highlights that the migration of free-phase gas along fault F-100 may not occur along a large volume of the fault damage zone (Ligtenberg, 2005), but instead it seems more likely restricted to a quite narrow corridor, spanning horizontally a few hundred meters (Fig. 13B). This mode of leakage is similar to the mechanism invoked by Foschi et al. (2018), and in line with works of Rubino et al. (2011), where the charge of stacked reservoir-like intervals occurs specifically along a central conduit region of focussed fluid flow rather spread along the entire extent of the gas-charged reservoir.\nAnother important point is that migration of gas along fault is often expected to proceed along the maximum dip of the fault where the buoyancy forces point along the direction of maximum pressure gradient between the overpressure region (e.g., the top reservoir) and the sea surface. Nevertheless, the direction of flow here observed diverges from a pure parallel direction of flow along the maximum dip of fault F-100 (Figs. 10 and 13B). This migration direction suggests that a preferential permeability pathway, which is likely to be formed once the fault open under excess pressure (mode I, e.g., Gudmundsson, 2011), represent the most efficient mechanism to release hydrocarbons from the Marjoram Gas Field.\nThe restricted, and \u201cdiagonal\u201d pathway reconstructed in this study using the centroid analysis requires certainly further analysis (e.g., fault F-100, Fig. 3B). It is also true that the mechanism here invoked may well represent the dominant migration process rather than the full one \u2013 it is indeed expected that a proportion of gas escaping the Marjoram Gas Field could be driven along more pathways and may include a certain component of migration by capillary invasion in the sealing units (Jain and Juanes, 2009) and even a component of migration of gas in solution (Bjorkum et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the results point dominantly to a single migration mechanism, focused into a single migration pathway.\nThe implications from this work apply directly to those topseal-related tasks required for production and decommissioning from leaky hydrocarbon fields. The use of seismic data (Cartwright and Huuse, 2005), and detailed analysis, such as the one presented in this study, should provide more information on where hydrocarbon escape from topseals and specifically where the weakest part of the seal is with respect to the extent of the reservoir (Foschi and Cartwright, 2020). From a monitoring perspective analysis of this type should be routinely used, and updated on repeated seismic campaigns, to spot changes that could indicate a variation of the dominant mechanism of gas migration (escape) from the monitored site (e.g., CCS sites; Arts et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe main conclusions are as follows:\n\n1.\nThe Marjoram Gas Field is a multi-TCF gas field obscured by a large gas chimney composed of 10s of amplitude anomalies and consistent with the definition of vertical anomaly cluster\n\n\n2.\nDetailed analysis of the vertical anomaly cluster, using centroid analysis, reveals a precise pathway for gas leakage across the overburden\n\n\n3.\nIntegration of the geophysical observations with pressure test data shows that mode I dilation of a fracture induced by the 455\u00a0m gas column in the reservoir is responsible for leakage\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorship contribution\nM.F. developed the study, interpreted, and integrated the geophysical data, wrote the manuscript.

The dimensions of the ridge exceed those of the Alps in central Europe as the flat top is elevated up to 3\u00a0km above the flanking abyssal plains.\nThe Canada\/Greenland side (89\u00b0 N- 85\u00b0 N) of the Lomonosov Ridge is below the broad stream of old heavily ridged sea ice flowing out of the Arctic Ocean (Rigor et al., 2002) and is only accessible for seismic profiling from drifting ice stations. The exception is a 10\u00a0km long multichannel seismic section acquired by icebreaker (Knudsen et al., 2017) across the ridge perimeter at 89\u00b0 N (Fig. 1, green track). As a result, the only seismic transects available across the level top of the ridge are a single drift track collected in 1965 from the ice drift station Arlis II using a five kilo-watt sparker recording on electrostatic paper (Ostenso and Wold, 1977) and three traverses made in 1985 by the Soviet ice station North Pole -28 (Fig. 1, red track). The seismic source used on North Pole-28 (NP-28) was blasting caps fired at 500\u00a0m intervals (Gramberg et al., 1991; Langinen et al., 2009). The signals were recorded on analog tape and later digitized. The first ridge transects between 89\u00b0 N and 85\u00b0 N producing modern seismic data (Fig. 1, white tracks) are three complete and one partial crossings obtained during the Fram-2014\/15 ice drift (Kristoffersen et al., 2016). This was single channel seismic data from a 0.3-L air gun source digitally recorded at 25\u00a0m shot spacings. Here, we report on four crestal sites showing local seismic amplitude anomalies forming wide pipes flanked by up-bent layering. We suggest an origin related to gas-charged fluid migration from deeper pre-Cenozoic hydrocarbon source rocks.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Alaska-facing side of the Lomonosov Ridge (Fig. 1) represents the continental margin between Greenland and west Siberia in the pre-Cenozoic Arctic Ocean (Blakey, 2020). The Lomonosov Ridge was rifted off the continental margin of Mesozoic polar Europe as the North Atlantic mid-ocean ridge system propagated into the Arctic Ocean during the Paleocene (Wilson, 1963; Johnson and Heezen, 1967, Karasik, 1968; Vogt et al., 1979, Glebovsky et al., 2006; Moran et al., 2006). The Lomonosov Ridge appears aseismic within the time span covered by the instrumental record (http:\/\/nnsn.geo.uib.no\/intaros_eqcat\/), with the exception of a possible submarine volcanic eruption experienced by the Soviet ice drift station North Pole 3 in 1956 (Gakkel, 1958).\nThe Lomonosov Ridge may be divided into three segments (Fig. 1, insert) based on its morphology and the tectonic trends of its internal crustal blocks (Rekant et al., 2019). The Siberian segment is formed by numerous narrow parallel blocks and the Central segment has two large slightly oblique trending parallel blocks. The North American segment is dominated by smaller blocks in the narrow part near the North Pole and a large block south of 89\u00b0 N (Fig. 1). The sediment deposits on the Central segment of the ridge as studied by seismic surveys and scientific drilling (Fig. 1, ACEX site) show a Mesozoic wedge prograding towards Alaska capped by a 420\u00a0m thick flat-lying early Eocene-Recent sediment section (Jokat et al., 1992; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2005, Moran et al., 2006). The flat-lying section consists of an upper \u02de193\u00a0m thick unit (Unit 1\/1-1\/4) of unconsolidated silty clay younger than late early Miocene (Fig. 2\n). An apparent \u02de 26-million-year stratigraphic gap within subunit 1\/5 (\u02de6\u00a0m thick) separates the upper clays from the underlying early Eocene dark homogeneous silty clay (Unit 1\/6, 22\u00a0m thick) which overlies a ca. 93 m thick sequence (Unit 2) of bio-siliceous silty clay and ooze (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2005; Moran et al., 2006; Backman et al., 2008). This apparent stratigraphic gap could possibly represent an extended period of slow sedimentation from latest Eocene to early late Miocene (Poirier and Hillaire-Marcel, 2011; Chernykh and Krylov, 2017). The lowermost unit of silty clay to mudstone (Unit 3) extends into the earliest Eocene and rests with an angular unconformity on sandy sediments of Campanian age (Jokat et al., 1992; Backman et al., 2008).\nThe North American segment of the Lomonosov Ridge was studied by three seismic transects of the ice drift station NP-28 (Fig. 1). Langinen et al. (2009) correlated the acoustic reflection pattern of the upper 0.4\u00a0s at 88\u00b0 N with the Cenozoic section at the ACEX drill site. The underlying <1\u00a0s thick sediments above acoustic basement at this latitude are thickest on the Alaska-facing side of the ridge.\nThe post-Early Eocene history of the Lomonosov Ridge as documented by scientific drilling on the Central ridge segment, is dominated by hemipelagic sediment deposition with a contribution of fines contributed by bottom currents and coarser material brought in by sea ice (Moran et al., 2006). The hemi-pelagic section forms a uniform drape over the flat top and is tapered along the ridge perimeter over the highest part of the ridge (Jokat et al., 1992; Langinen et al., 2009) by contour-following bottom currents (Bowden, 1960; Hunkins et al., 1969; Bird et al., 1982; Rudels et al., 1999; McCave et al., 2001). Along-ridge sedimentation rates are only known for the middle to late Quaternary part and appear to vary by a factor of more than five (N\u00f8rgard Pedersen et al., 2007; Sell\u00e9n et al., 2008; Polyak and Jakobsson, 2011). The sediment supply during this period was highest at the Siberian end of the Lomonosov Ridge and lowest over the end north of Canada\/Greenland.\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\nOld and heavily ridged sea ice makes the area south of 89\u00b0 N on the North American segment of the Lomonosov Ridge inaccessible for seismic surveys by icebreakers. We have used a hovercraft platform (Fig. 3\n) drifting with the sea ice at about 5\u00a0km\/day to acquire about 1000\u00a0km of seismic reflection data (Kristoffersen et al., 2016). The data reported here was obtained in ambient temperatures between \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C and \u221243\u00a0\u00b0C during the polar night from December 2014 through February 2015. Our sound source was a single 0.3-L (20 inch3) air gun at 3\u00a0m depth below the ice powered by a diving compressor. The signal was received by a single hydrophone suspended just below the <2\u00a0m thick ice at a 25\u00a0m offset from the source and recorded at a 2\u00a0ms sampling rate (Fig. 3). The oscillations from the air bubble released by the air gun delayed by about 60\u00a0ms presented an extra challenge as the working air pressure was sometimes allowed to decay 10\u201320\u00a0bar below the nominal 140\u00a0bar value. Removal of the bubble pulse therefore required accurate tracking of the variation in arrival time of the pulse followed by a trial-and-error procedure to estimate its effective frequency content (Kristoffersen et al., 2021). The processing sequence includes time variable bandpass filtering (10\u2013140\u00a0Hz), enhancement of coherent events in the tau-p domain, source deghosting and Kirchoff time migration. The dominant frequency at the seabed is \u02de60\u00a0Hz and \u02de40\u00a0Hz at 1\u00a0s (two-way travel time) sub-bottom depth giving a resolution (\u03bb\/4) of 8\u201310\u00a0m. The zero-phase data is displayed following the SEG-polarity convention. For travel time-depth conversion in the Cenozoic sediments, we use a compressional velocity of 1.6\u00a0km\/s based on the results from the ACEX drill site (O'Regan et al., 2010).\n\n\n4\nResults\nA seismic transect across the North American segment of the Lomonosov Ridge at about 87\u00b0 N shows sediments onlapping the acoustic basement from the Alaska side (Figs. 1 and 4\n, upper panel). The total sediment thickness ranges from 0.7\u00a0s (two-way travel time) in the west to 0.2\u00a0s in the east. We first established a tentative seismic stratigraphy by acoustic signature correlation of the undisturbed hemi-pelagic Cenozoic sediment cover on the top of Lomonosov Ridge at 87\u00b0 N with the reflection sequences across the ACEX drill site (Figs. 1 and 2). The characteristic features at 87\u00b0 N (Fig. 2, left column) are two close reflection events around 1.8\u00a0s (reflectors B and C) and a package of high amplitude reflectors from 1.93\u00a0s to 2.1\u00a0s. This pattern matches the reflectivity pattern across the ACEX drill site except for a much thinner section of the soft-to-hard silty clay of Unit 1 above reflector B (Fig. 2). The correlation suggests the reverse standard polarity reflector B at 87\u00b0 N corresponds to the top of the bio-silicious silty clay to mudstone (Unit 2) of ACEX. We consider reflector D to be time equivalent to the top of the silty clay Unit 3 (early late Eocene) associated with a 40\u201350\u00a0m thick Opal A-C\/T reaction zone (Ogawa et al., 2008; O'Regan et al., 2010).\nThe seismic data show distinct seismic amplitude anomalies below the seabed at four separate locations (Figs. 1, 4 and 5\n). Sites 1 and 2 are within 5.4\u00a0km of each other. Sites 3 and 4 are separated by 15\u00a0km and Site 3 is about 150\u00a0km away from Site 1 and 2. The acoustic stratigraphy at the four sites (Figs. 5 and 6\n) is characterized by:\n\ni)\nA \u02de 600\u00a0m wide column of seismic amplitude anomalies centered within a <1.5\u00a0km wide zone of up-bent reflection events (Figs. 5 and 6).\n\n\nii)\nShort bright reflection segments of reverse standard polarity are present within the amplitude anomaly column at all sites and the columns terminate in a depression at the seabed, except at Site 2 (Figs. 5a and 6a).\n\n\niii)\nThe up-bending starts at reflector D at sites 1 and 2 and increases slightly upwards (Fig. 6a) while up-bending at sites 3 and 4 also involves strata below reflector D (Fig. 6b).\n\n\n\nThe column of amplitude anomalies at Site 1 starts with bright reflection segments at the level of reflector D in the vicinity of a fault trace (Fig. 6a). The fault may extend down to high amplitude reflections at 2.5\u00a0s depth (Fig. 5a). These reflections appear flat over distances >3\u00a0km. The thickness of the high amplitude reflection package is 50\u00a0ms or more (>100\u00a0m assuming 4\u00a0km\/s). Below sites 3 and 4, the amplitude anomaly columns are positioned directly over the crests of rotated blocks which are internally stratified (Fig. 5b and c).\n\n\n5\nInterpretation\n\n5.1\nThe seismic amplitude anomalies\nThe numerous short bright reflection segments present in the columns of amplitude anomalies at sites 1\u20134 suggest the presence of free gas in the sediments (L\u00f8seth et al., 2009). Also, the acoustic images across sites 1\u20134 are similar to seismic images of stratigraphy where focused expulsion of fluids and gas has been documented (L\u00f8seth et al., 2001, 2009; Svensen et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2005; Hansen, 2006; Judd and Hovland, 2007; Moss and Cartwright, 2010; Hustoft et al., 2010; Gay et al., 2012; Cartwright and Santamarina, 2015; Maestrelli et al., 2017). We interpret the stacked chaotic reflections forming these columns or pipes of amplitude anomalies at each site to be conduits for fluids and gas expulsion, possibly related to a fracture network (Arntsen et al., 2007; Jain and Juanes, 2009). Although hydro-fracturing is commonly cited to explain how wide pipes will form in fine-grained sediments, there is thus far no published direct evidence for in situ fractures in pipes as identified in the seismic data (Cartwright and Santamarina, 2015) except for rare outcrop examples (Morley, 2003; L\u00f8seth et al., 2011). The more continuous reflections at sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 6a, reflectors A and B) may have minor fractures and faults of dimensions which are unresolvable in our seismic data.\n\n\n5.2\nThe origin of up-bent acoustic layering\nAny sediment deformation from a tectonic event can be ruled out as published and unpublished seismic data from the Central and North American segments of the Lomonosov Ridge show no evidence of local horizontal tectonic deformation within the Cenozoic sediment section beneath the level top of the ridge (Jokat et al., 1992; Jokat, 2005; Langinen et al., 2009; Sauermilch et al., 2018; Rekant et al., 2019; Weigelt et al., 2020). Our single channel vertical incidence seismic reflection data provide no velocity information and no offset range to facilitate attribute analysis. The apparent up-bent acoustic layering at all sites could be a velocity effect (pull-up), sediment deformation or both. These effects are discussed below.\n\ni)\nvelocity:\n\n\n\nHigher velocities could derive from the presence of methane-derived authigenic carbonates and\/or hydrates. Authigenic carbonate form near the sediment-water interface sourced by methane-rich fluids, but carbonate lumps and pavements associated with pockmarks may not be resolved by conventional seismic reflection data (Hovland et al., 1987; Judd and Hovland, 2007; Magalh\u00e3esa et al., 2012; Judd et al., 2020; Kravchishina et al., 2021). The syn-depositional process of carbonate production from methane is unlikely to contribute to the velocity anomalies at sites 1\u20134. It would require local methane input throughout deposition of the siliclastic Unit 1 and the mud-bearing siliceous oozes of Unit 2.\nGas hydrates in the sediments can increase the compressional velocity by 1\u00a0km\/s or more depending on the degree of hydrate saturation (Lee et al., 1993; Guerin and Goldberg, 2005; Madof, 2018). The apparent up-bending of layers at sites 1\u20134 could be a velocity anomaly related to emplacement of hydrates in veins or fractures generated by gas overpressure. This has been suggested for the well-surveyed CNE03 chimney below the Nyegga pockmark field on the southeastern V\u00f8ring Plateau (Westbrook et al., 2008; Plaza-Faverola et al., 2010). The presence of hydrate was inferred from a high-velocity (up to +0.3\u00a0km\/s) region in the upper 250\u00a0m below the seabed. The magnitude of the apparent up-bending at CNE03 is 50% higher than at sites 1\u20134 on the Lomonosov Ridge.\nGas hydrates may be inferred from the presence of a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) or reduced seismic amplitudes (Shipley et al., 1979; Lee and Dillon, 2001; Hornbach et al., 2003). There is no credible evidence of a BSR at the predicted depth of 0.2\u00a0s below the seabed on the Central and Siberian segment of the Lomonosov Ridge (Jokat, 2005; O'Regan and Moran, 2010; Weigelt et al., 2020). This depth corresponds to that midway between reflectors C and D (Figs. 2 and 6). On the North American segment of the Lomonosov Ridge, the four crossings (Fig. 1) acquired during the Fram-2014\/15 ice drift (Kristoffersen et al., 2016) have been scrutinized for indications of a BSR reflection cross-cutting the tapered sediment strata at the ridge perimeter (Shipley et al., 1979; Berndt et al., 2004). No such indications were found. Amplitude blanking, another common characteristic of free gas above hydrate-bearing sediments (Shipley et al., 1979), is also not observed in the area of sites 1\u20134. However, the absence of a BSR does not necessarily mean methane is absent (Xu and Ruppel, 1999). Formation of hydrates and a BSR requires a supply of gas exceeding the solubility in seawater and losses due to diffusion and the sulphate reduction process (Zatsepina and Buffett, 1997; Borowski et al., 1999). We infer that any gas hydrate concentration is low and the effect on the compressional wave velocity at sites 1\u20134, is too small to explain the sediment deformation as a velocity pull-up.\n\nii)\nSediment deformation:\n\n\n\nThe up-bent layering at sites 1\u20134 could also indicate the presence of mobilized sediments as suggested for the upward convex mound structures observed on the Gjallar Ridge, offshore mid-Norway (Hansen et al., 2005). The type A and B mounds on the Gjallar Ridge (Fig. 11 and 13 in Hansen et al., 2005) are interpreted to have formed by forceful upward migration of a mobilized clay-rich ooze-fluid mix driven in part by the buoyancy of exsolved gas. The mounds on Gjallar Ridge have no clear evidence of rim-synclines as is also the case on the Lomonosov Ridge (Fig. 6).\nThe Cenozoic section on top of the Lomonosov Ridge appears undisturbed, but includes a unit of Eocene bio-silicious ooze (Unit 2) of reduced stability (Kristoffersen et al., 2007; O'Regan et al., 2010). The up-doming at sites 1 and 2 starts at reflector D, equivalent to the base of the high porosity and low-density bio-silicious silty clay and mudstone of Unit 2. This strongly suggests the up-doming was driven by sediment mobilization within this unit (Figs. 2 and 6a). The inferred trigger was pressure induced by fluids and gas from a deeper hydrocarbon source (Fig. 5). At sites 3 and 4, the doming starts slightly deeper than reflector D and the column of amplitude anomalies extend down to the top of rotated fault blocks which may indicate pipe formation at higher pressures and supply rates of fluids and gas (Fig. 5b and c).\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nThe physical properties and stability of the cenozoic sediment section\nUsing the stratigraphic framework proposed in Fig. 2, we consider the observed sediment properties at the ACEX drill site (O'Regan et al., 2010) as an approximation for the condition at the sites of our seismic amplitude anomalies (Figs. 1, 2, 4\u20136). Based on consolidation and shear strength measurements on the drilled core material, those authors concluded that the Cenozoic section is in a state of under-consolidation or over-pressure despite low sedimentation rates. Furthermore, their one-dimensional compaction modelling suggests the overpressure is supported by fluids in excess of the estimated contribution from mechanical compaction or liberated by Opal A-C\/T transformation (O'Regan et al., 2010). Thus, the flat-lying Cenozoic section at the top of the Lomonosov Ridge is in a state pre-conditioned for pipe formation or sediment mobilization driven by gas-charged fluid migration (Huuse et al., 2010). In particular, the stability of the bio-silicious ooze of the Eocene Unit 2 is reduced; its density is \u02de0.4\u00a0g\u00a0cm3 lower than the overlying sediments, the porosity is high (40\u201360%) and the permeability is low in the lower part of the unit (Fig. 2). In this respect, the sediments share physical property characteristics with the mud rocks of the Hordaland Group in the North Sea or the Brygge Formation off mid-Norway where evidence of extensive sediment mobilization has been observed (L\u00f8seth et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2005).\n\n\n6.2\nPipe architecture\nThe bright reflection segments indicate the presence of gas-charged sediments (Fig. 6). The mode of gas migration through sediments is to a large extent controlled by grain size and fracturing would be the dominant process in clays and mudstone (Jain and Juanes, 2009). Fracture networks would develop in the fine-grained hemi-pelagic Cenozoic sediments on the Lomonosov Ridge and collectively form pathways to the seabed in response to gas overpressure introduced from below. The anomalous seismic amplitude patterns at sites 3 and 4 are more chaotic throughout the length of the pipes than at sites 1 and 2. This suggests the extent of the fracture networks along with the distribution of gas and hence the compressional velocity distribution is more complex (Arntsen et al., 2007). A grey-scale plot with trace amplitudes illuminated from above enhance subtle trace-to-trace vertical low amplitude trends which may be interpreted as anastomosing pathways of the internal pipe architecture (Fig. 5c). The pipes appear to be slightly wider at the base (Fig. 5c, yellow dashed outline).\n\n\n6.3\nThe timing of fluid and gas expulsion\nSeabed pock marks are considered diagnostic of blow-out event(s) (L\u00f8seth et al., 2001, 2011, Hovland et al., 2002). Each amplitude anomaly pipe at sites 3 and 4 extends to a seabed depression interpreted as a pockmark (Fig. 6b). The mobilized sediments involve the entire stratigraphic column suggesting long term gas leakage until recent times particularly at Site 3 (Fig. 6b). At Site 1, truncated reflectors below a drape \u033437\u00a0ms (\u02de 30\u00a0m) thick frame a paleo-pock mark (Fig. 6a). Later gas leakage into the drape is indicated by a small bright spot within the drape just above the center of the truncated level. The drape covering the blow-out event(s) may have been deposited in <4 million years as the average Pleistocene sedimentation rate was 1.17 cm\/ka for the central part of the Lomonosov Ridge (O'Regan et al., 2008) and 0.75 cm\/ka at the Canadian end of the ridge during the late Quaternary (N\u00f8rgaard-Pedersen et al., 2007). At Site 2, the signal amplitude of the seabed reflection is enhanced, suggesting gas leakage until recent times (Fig. 6a).\n\n\n6.4\nPossible sources of the deep fluids and gas\nThe Eocene sediments recovered at the ACEX site (units 1\/6, 2 and 3) had a content of total organic matter (TOC) in the range of 1\u20135% of algae-type origin accumulated under anoxic-euxinic conditions (Stein et al., 2006; Stein, 2007). However, the low overburden (\u02de 200\u00a0m) has resulted in a state of thermal maturity insufficient for hydrocarbon generation (Mann et al., 2009). Therefore, possible source rocks for the gas have to be the underlying Mesozoic or older stratigraphic levels (Moore et al., 2011).\nAt site 1, the gas-charged sediments above reflector D appear to be connected to high amplitude reflections at 2.5\u00a0s depth via a fault (Fig. 5a). The reflections are interpreted as the distal ends of lava flows as they lack cusp-like terminations characteristic of intrusions (Malthe-S\u00f8rensen et al., 2004; Planke et al., 2005). Permeability anomalies associated with the fault may have allowed fluids and gas from over-pressured sub-basalt hydrocarbon sources to escape to the seabed at Site 1. The communication between the pipe at Site 2 and a source region at depth is less clear (Fig. 5a). At sites 3 and 4, the pipes are located directly above rotated stratified fault blocks (Fig. 5b and c). We suggest that these fluid and gas expulsion pipes at sites 3 and 4 have been sourced from hydrocarbon reservoir(s) with a connection to their respective fault blocks.\nThe paleo-position of sites 1\u20134 was north of Franz Josef Land prior to Late Cretaceous rifting and opening of the Eurasia Basin during the Cenozoic (Fig. 7\n). An up-to 500\u00a0m thick section of basalt flows with interbedded tuffs, sandstones, shales and siltstone of Hauterivian to Albian age (130-100\u00a0Ma) is present on Franz Josef Land (Dibner, 1978, 1998; Campsie et al., 1988; Corfu et al., 2013; Shipilov, 2016). The volcanics are considered to be part of a larger High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP) (Buchanan and Ernst, 2006; Drachev and Saunders, 2006) which we assume may also include the basalts on Lomonosov Ridge being the continental margin to the north at that time (Fig. 7). If so, the primary source of fluids or gas which mobilized the shallow sediments at sites 1\u20134 were beds of possibly Early Cretaceous age or older. At that time, the Arctic Ocean was a closed basin with restricted connections to the global ocean (Zakharov et al., 2011; Akhmetiev et al., 2012; Schroder-Adams, 2013; Brikiatis, 2014; Blakey, 2021). Two periods during the Mesozoic, i.e. the late Jurassic and the middle Triassic are characterized by deposition of organic-rich marine muds on the circum-arctic continental margins (Leith et al., 1993; Stein, 2007; Moore et al., 2011). The late Jurassic is represented by the Upper Kingak Formation on the Alaska North Slope, the Husky Formation on the McKenzie Delta, the Ringnes Formation in the Sverdrup Basin and the Aagardfjellet Formation (Dybvik, 1985; Ohm et al., 2019; Weniger et al., 2019) in the Svalbard area. Examples of organic-rich middle Triassic muds are the Shublik Formation on the Alaska North Slope, the Murray Harbour and Hoyle Bay Formations in the Sverdrup Basin and the Botneheia Formation on Svalbard. The fluid escape pipes discovered on the Lomonosov Ridge thus represent the first indications of hydrocarbon source rocks present on the pre-Cenozoic continental margin of polar Europe.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nLocal seismic amplitude anomalies in the sediments 0.3\u20130.8\u00a0s (\u02de240\u2013500\u00a0m) sub-bottom are present at four separate locations in water depths of \u03341200\u00a0m on top of the North American segment (89\u00b0N-85\u00b0N) of the Lomonosov Ridge. The acoustic sections across the sites show <1.5\u00a0km wide and <25\u00a0m high domes with a central pipe (width <600\u00a0m) of amplitude anomalies ranging from continuous to chaotic. These features are considered to represent sites of gas-charged fluid migration terminating at the seabed as a pock mark. The doming and pipe formation was generated by mobilization of unstable high porosity and low density Eocene bio-siliceous ooze triggered by intruding free gas and fluids from deeper pre-Cenozoic hydrocarbon source beds. The paleo-position of the pipes was the continental margin of a restricted Mesozoic polar basin, which experienced deposition of hydrocarbon source rocks during the late Jurassic and the middle Triassic.\n\n","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nDespite their simple mineralogy, carbonate rocks typically undergo heterogeneous post-depositional diagenesis that can significantly alter their original textures and petrophysical and mechanical properties. Diagenetic processes like dissolution, cementation or mineral replacement are intimately linked to the diagenetic fluids that circulate through the pore space, and are therefore controlled by the available flow pathways and volume of fluid delivered to the reaction zone (Whitaker et al., 2004). In turn, the resulting diagenetic products impact the permeability and further reactivity of the evolving rock, creating highly complex feedback relationships that are challenging to decipher and predict. Understanding the factors that determine the distribution of diagenetic products is key for the study of the evolution of sedimentary basins and orogens, and also for predicting permeability anisotropy and reservoir quality (e.g., Moore, 2001; James and Jones, 2015). A wide range of studies have focused on the identification of the main controls on fluid flow in carbonate rocks and how they determine the distribution of diagenetic products (e.g., Agar and Hampson, 2014, and references therein). These studies include: (i) characteristics of the pores, which are controlled by the rock's depositional textures and diagenetic history, (ii) distribution and properties of fracture networks, (iii) type of pore fluids (marine, meteoric, basinal brines, etc.), their properties (temperature, pressure, salinity, etc.) and the forces that drive them to and from the reaction sites. However, less attention has been paid to stylolites as structures capable of partitioning fluid flow and creating permeability anisotropy that ultimately determines where, how and when diagenetic alterations take place.\nStylolites are usually rough dissolution surfaces that form during intergranular pressure-solution (e.g., Merino, 1992; Koehn et al., 2007; Toussaint et al., 2018). Bedding-parallel stylolites, also called diagenetic or sedimentary stylolites, form during burial and compaction as a response to layer-normal compression associated with the load of the overburden sediments. Stylolites are ubiquitous in most carbonate formations, present variable distributions depending on the host rocks (Ehrenberg et al., 2016) and often form complex anastomosing networks (Ben-Itzhak et al., 2014; Humphrey et al., 2020). These structures have historically been considered barriers to fluid flow across stylolites because they can collect insoluble material (e.g., clays, mica, oxides, sulphides, organic matter) while they grow (e.g., Nelson, 1981; Finkel and Wilkinson, 1990; Alsharhan and Sadd, 2000). Moreover, their growth can lead to a significant reduction of the overall porosity and permeability of the host rock because the dissolved mineral can re-precipitate nearby in the form of cement, thus controlling flow pathways for fluids that can induce further diagenetic reactions (Fabricius and Borre, 2007; Vandeginste and John, 2013). However, other studies have shown that fluids can also flow across stylolites (e.g., Neilson and Oxtoby, 2008; Morad et al., 2018), especially at their flanks and tips (Carozzi and von Bergen, 1987; Van Geet et al., 2001; Koehn et al., 2016; Humphrey et al., 2019). Stylolites can also be filled with cements, suggesting that fluids can be advected through them under certain conditions and precipitate minerals (Paganoni et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2018). Recently, laboratory permeability tests on core plugs have reported situations in which stylolites might not influence the overall vertical permeability of the rock in any way, because the measured permeability perpendicular to stylolites was the same as that in samples with no stylolites (Heap et al., 2014, 2018; Rustichelli et al., 2015). Furthermore, these authors also showed that stylolites can increase the overall rock permeability along the direction parallel to the stylolite plane. Koehn et al. (2016) proposed a new classification of stylolites in which their geometry and formation mechanisms determine whether they can be barriers to fluid flow or not. Bruna et al. (2019) recently reviewed the knowledge on how the formation and evolution of stylolites can define their behaviour with respect to fluid transport and cementation and concluded that further studies are required in order to fully understand the range of behaviour that these structures can present. In summary, deciphering the impact of stylolites on their host rock permeability is important to understand the flow of diagenetic and mineralizing fluids, and also for petroleum migration (e.g., Neilson et al., 1998; Baron and Parnell, 2007; Paganoni et al., 2016).\nWithin the framework of the ongoing debate on the impact of stylolites on fluid flow, it is critical that we can understand how these structures control the formation of other diagenetic products such as cements, replaced mineral phases and dissolution vugs. A key to constraining the influence of bedding-parallel stylolites on carbonate diagenesis is the careful examination of their spatial and temporal relationships with different diagenetic products at multiple scales. In this way three end-member scenarios can be proposed (Fig. 1\n). The first scenario considers that stylolites act as conduits for fluids and, therefore, the diagenetic reaction progresses from connected stylolites outwards (Fig. 1a). A second situation can arise when stylolite porosity and permeability are the same as those of the host rock and, therefore, they do not control fluid flow, and diagenetic reactions are not influenced by them (Fig. 1b). Finally, a third end-member case is one in which the diagenetic fluid cannot overcome stylolites so that the reaction is constrained to either side of the stylolite and, therefore, they act as reaction baffles (Fig. 1c). These scenarios assume that the diagenetic fluid can transport enough solutes to the reaction site, by advection-diffusion, and that the reaction will occur if the fluid reactivity and environmental conditions are appropriate. Finally, another hitherto key aspect not considered is that stylolites in nature often appear arranged in networks rather than in isolation (e.g., Ben-Itzhak et al., 2014; Humphrey et al., 2019; Humphrey et al., 2020). One should therefore evaluate how stylolites may collectively impact fluid flow, transport and reactions, and what the role of networks of stylolites is on these processes.\nWith the aim of tackling the questions above and improving our understanding of the controls that stylolites exert on fluid flow, transport and diagenetic reactions, we present and discuss examples from shallow-marine Upper Aptian-lowermost Albian carbonates of the Benassal Formation (Fm) in the Benic\u00e0ssim area (Maestrat Basin, E. Spain). We examine mineral replacement reactions (dolomitization and dolomite calcitization) at multiple scales, dolomite recrystallization, dissolution, and precipitation of saddle dolomite, calcite and iron oxide cements. Building upon the extensive previous knowledge of the area (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2013, 2015, 2018; Gomez-Rivas et al., 2014; Humphrey et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), we provide new observations and analyses of outcrops and samples to decipher (i) whether individual stylolites act as baffles\/inhibitors or enhancers of different types of diagenetic reactions, (ii) whether the same structures can exhibit different transport behaviour and, finally, (iii) to what extent large-scale diagenetic alterations (i.e., with dimensions of metres to kilometres) can be controlled by stylolite networks.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Early Cretaceous Benic\u00e0ssim carbonate platform (Maestrat Basin, E. Spain) (Fig. 2\na and b) constitutes a world-class example of syn-rift shallow-marine carbonate deposition (Salas et al., 2001) and fault-controlled hydrothermal dolomitization (Yao et al., 2020). In this area, a >1600\u00a0m-thick succession of syn-rift shallow-marine Upper Aptian-lowermost Albian limestones of the Benassal Fm was partially dolomitized as a result of the flow of warm brines that were advected from the underlying sedimentary and basement rocks along large-scale faults, which acted as feeders for dolomitizing and subsequent mineralizing fluids (Fig. 2c; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2013; Gomez-Rivas et al., 2014; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015, 2018; Yao et al., 2020). The host rock succession, which is stacked in three transgressive-regressive sequences, underwent a complex diagenetic history (Fig. 2c; Fig. 3\n), including mechanical compaction, early calcite and dolomite cementation, chemical compaction, two phases of replacive dolomitization, burial dissolution, local brecciation (in the vicinity of faults), calcite cementation, sulphide mineralization and, finally, calcitization of dolomite as well as late meteoric calcite cementation (see Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015 for a complete description of the paragenesis). The first dolomitization phase (RD1) mimicked the original limestone texture while the second dolomite phase (RD2) formed by recrystallization of RD1.\n\n\n3\nPrevious work\nField and petrographic observations show that bedding-parallel stylolites formed soon after deposition during the early diagenetic stages in close association with the Early Cretaceous rifting. In this regard, chemical compaction by stylolitization predated dolomite cementation and replacive dolomitization stages (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015, 2018) (Fig. 2b). Humphrey et al. (2020) investigated the prevalence of the different stylolite types in the most representative carbonate depositional facies of the Benassal Fm, using the classification of Koehn et al. (2016). Suture-and-sharp peak and wave-like stylolites are ubiquitous in all the facies analyzed, with grainstones also featuring rectangular layer-type stylolites (Fig. 4\n). Facies with relatively homogeneous components, such as bioclastic and ooidal\/peloidal grainstones, tend to present parallel (i.e., non-anastomosing) stylolites with large spacings and low amplitudes (Fig. 4a and b). Stylolites in mud-supported facies, with heterogeneous grain compositions, poor sorting and meter-scale bedding, typically have high amplitudes, they are normally closely spaced and tend to form anastomosing networks (Fig. 4c and d).\nBurial curves indicate that dolomitization took place at depths of less than 1\u00a0km during the Late Cretaceous post-rift period (Fig. 2c). The dolomitizing fluid was a seawater-derived brine that interacted and exchanged with the underlying Permian-Triassic and Paleozoic basement rocks (Gomez-Rivas et al., 2014). Post-replacement cements include burial calcite cement filling intercrystalline porosity, and hydrothermal saddle dolomite and blocky calcite cements in the vicinity of faults (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2018). Dolomite calcitization released Fe from the dolostones and was caused by the circulation of meteoric fluids, which took place more intensively in areas close to major faults (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015). The Benic\u00e0ssim and equivalent rocks in the Maestrat Basin host Mississippi Valley Type metal sulphide deposits that were dated by U\u2013Pb at 62.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma by Grandia et al. (2000). Moreover, two events of Alpine deformation were identified from fracture and vein networks in the area, with a first strike-slip event with WSW-ENE-oriented horizontal compression and a second oblique-slip event with SW-NE-oriented principal compressive stress (Gomez-Rivas et al., 2012).\nDolostones in the Benic\u00e0ssim area crop out as seismic-scale geobodies with geometries ranging from massive patches around large-scale faults, which were interpreted to have acted as entry points of dolomitizing fluids, to very well-defined stratabound geobodies that extend for long distances away from them (Yao et al., 2020). The dolomitized stratabound units in the studied outcrops have thicknesses of up to 150\u00a0m (Fig. 5\na) and replace limestones that were deposited mostly during the regressive cycles of the two uppermost transgressive-regressive sequences of the Benassal Fm (see Yao et al., 2020 for a detailed study of the relationships between sequence stratigraphy and dolomitization).\n\n\n4\nMethods\nExpanding upon extensive research on the Benic\u00e0ssim area, we have carefully mapped and examined diagenetic replacement fronts at variable scales, ranging from the km-to the \u03bcm-scale, away from large-scale faults and within the stratigraphic and structural context. We have re-examined more than 300 thin sections analyzed in previous studies (e.g., Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2013, 2015, 2018; Gomez-Rivas et al., 2014; Humphrey et al., 2020, Yao et al., 2020). Moreover, 20 additional samples of selected reaction fronts were collected for a detailed characterization of such surfaces. Samples were collected with a portable drill, to acquire cylinders with a diameter of 1\u201d. Double-polished thin sections were made from those samples. Details of stylolites and diagenetic reaction fronts were systematically studied with standard petrographic and cathodoluminescence microscopy, the latter with a Technosyn Cold Cathode Luminescence model 8200 MkII, with operating conditions of 15\u201318\u00a0kV and gun current of 300\u2013350 A. Thin sections of existing and new samples were carbon-coated for their study using an ISI ABT-55 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at 15\u00a0kV at the University of Aberdeen.\nStylolites were classified according to Koehn et al. (2016). The term wave-like stylolites also includes the so-called wispy seams and pressure-solution seams (with peak amplitude <1\u00a0cm) of Alsharhan and Sadd (2000). Depositional textures of the limestones are defined using the scheme of Dunham (1962), including modifications by Embry and Klovan (1971).\n\n\n5\nResults\nThe field analysis of diagenetic reaction fronts cropping out in the Benic\u00e0ssim area where dolostone geobodies are stratabound revealed that bedding-parallel stylolites commonly form dolomitization fronts, and thus define the contact between dolostones and host limestones (Figs. 5 and 6\n). Less frequently, stylolites appear separating the two dolomite textures RD1 and RD2 (Fig. 6) or form the interface between dolomite and calcitized dolomite (Fig. 7\n). Additionally, stylolites are in some specific cases found open, with the stylolitic porosity partly enhanced by dissolution and filled with saddle dolomite and calcite cements and, in some other cases, with iron oxides (Fig. 8\n). In this section we describe the characteristics of the relationships between stylolites and five types of diagenetic reactions: dolomitization, dolomite recrystallization, dissolution, cementation and dolomite calcitization.\nA close look at the outcrops away from faults reveals that dolomitization fronts are always extremely sharp at the centimetre to metre scale, parallel to bedding and very frequently coincide with suture-and-sharp peak and wave-like stylolites (Fig. 5b\u2013d). The statistical analysis by Humphrey et al. (2020) of stylolite morphology and their statistical distributions revealed that dolomitized units tend to have stylolite distributions similar to those of relatively homogeneous non-dolomitized grainy facies (e.g., bioclastic and ooidal\/peloidal packstones and grainstones). However, limestones with anastomosing networks of stylolites, which are typically poorly sorted and mud-rich, frequently bound sets of dolomitized beds. In such cases, anastomosing stylolites coincide with dolomitization fronts (Fig. 5b\u2013d).\nField observations in the areas where dolostones are stratabound indicate that the dolomitization fronts weave up and down following consecutive stylolites (Fig. 5b\u2013c), and this is especially evident in facies in which stylolites form anastomosing networks and merge with or abut each other. Stylolite networks in such situations typically show the same geometry and distribution on both sides of the dolomitization front, so that these fronts do not necessarily coincide with bed surfaces or boundaries between different types of facies (Fig. 5b). On the contrary, fronts are embedded within the same poorly sorted and mud-rich facies.\nThe observation of dolomitization fronts at the microscale revealed that suture-and-sharp-peak and wave-like stylolites, as well as the reaction fronts associated with them, are not sharp and discrete at the scale of millimetres but have a width of up to a few tens of microns (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a\u2013c shows an illustrative example of a reaction front bounded by a series of stylolites. In the central part of this micrograph, the dolomitization front is limited by an up to 100\u00a0\u03bcm wide single pressure-solution zone (Fig. 6d). However, laterally two other stylolites bound the front resulting in a partial dolomitization of the rock volume between the two consecutive stylolites (Fig. 6b\u2013c). Pressure-solution zones corresponding to stylolites that are visible at the outcrop and thin section scale are not discrete surfaces at the microscale but have a certain width. These zones present a relatively high concentration of iron oxides (Fig. 6d) with some scarce clay minerals, mostly illite, as observed using SEM analysis. However, a massive and continuous residue at the pressure solution zone cannot be observed in the Benic\u00e0ssim stylolites. The absence of a systematic and continuous stylolite residue is consistent with the lack of clastic components in the >1600\u00a0m thick Benassal Fm sediments (Yao et al., 2020).\nThin sections show that stylolites also appear separating the two different types of replacive dolomite, RD1 and RD2, previously reported by Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al. (2015) (Figs. 3 and 6a,g). RD1 pervasively replaced micrite, skeletal and non-skeletal grains as well as pre-dolomitization calcite cements, causing a mimetic replacement that did not significantly alter the original porosity and permeability of the limestone. RD2 replaced RD1 in the most permeable areas resulting in non-mimetic, medium to coarse planar-s to non-planar-a crystal mosaics with higher porosity and permeability than RD1 dolomite. The main differences between RD1 and RD2 are the larger crystal size of the latter, and that RD2 crystals have RD1 core and clear edges. SEM examination of stylolites within dolostone reveals that stylolites pre-date dolomite crystal formation, because dolomite crystals systematically overprint stylolites (Fig. 6e,h-i). In thin sections these stylolites are observed to separate RD1 and RD2 crystals mosaics, suggesting that stylolites acted as recrystallization fronts (Fig. 6g). All the stylolites of Fig. 6g belong to the same anastomosing network, where the relative angle they form with each is a sectioning effect. Distinguishing between RD1 and RD2 at outcrops is difficult, and their differentiation is mainly based on thin section analysis. This implies that it is not possible to systematically evaluate and quantify the lateral extent and frequency of stylolites acting as recrystallization fronts.\nA relatively high proportion of the Benic\u00e0ssim dolostones appears calcitized (i.e., dedolomitized) in the volume of rock near outcrop surfaces and in the vicinity of faults (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015) (Fig. 7). This calcitization is associated with the formation of Fe oxides that give the characteristic brown\/orange colour of dolostones on outcrop surfaces (Fig. 7a and b). Bedding-parallel stylolites can also be found coinciding with dolomite calcitization fronts, so that the calcitization reaction only affected (or mostly affected) the rock volume on one side of the stylolite. The Benic\u00e0ssim dolostones have a variable but relatively high amount of Fe (up to 28,600\u00a0ppm; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015), and when dolomite is calcitized this Fe is not incorporated in the structure of the newly formed calcite crystals but is released to form Fe oxides (Fig. 7c, e). Moreover, the flow of meteoric fluids, likely subsaturated with respect to dolomite, resulted in the formation of irregularly distributed vuggy porosity. Both Fe oxides and newly formed pore space can be identified in hand specimen, and by optical and SEM petrography (Fig. 7e and f). Fe oxides can be found within stylolites (Fig. 8g).\nContrary to dolomitization, the processes of dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization are more heterogeneously distributed and difficult to be spatially characterized. Therefore, unlike the case of dolomitization, the systematic quantification of the relationships between stylolites and the processes of dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization from outcrop studies would require the collection of a very large number of core plugs that would damage the outcrops too much.\nBedding-parallel stylolitic porosity in the Benic\u00e0ssim dolostones is also found filled with saddle dolomite and calcite cements, which were interpreted to have formed from hydrothermal fluids (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2018, Fig. 8a\u2013f). The replacive dolomite appears partly dissolved in the proximity of one to 10\u00a0m-scale faults, such as those shown in Fig. 5a. That dissolution process appears to not affect limestones. Dolostones contain elongated vuggy pores that follow stylolites (Fig. 8a\u2013d,f). These dissolution features have a width of millimetres to centimetres, and can sometimes be up to about 2\u00a0m long. These type of dissolution pores are aligned parallel to bedding planes and concentrate along stylolites of the same types as those forming dolomitization fronts. Stylolitic pores are generally filled with saddle dolomite cements that rim the pores formed by dissolution (Fig. 8d,f). These cements typically have a white to pale yellowish colour and millimetre crystal size and are composed of mosaics of blade-shaped non-planar dolomite crystals. The remaining porosity left by the saddle dolomite cement rims is filled with coarse subhedral blocky calcite cement characterized by coarse and white to pale orange crystals. This cement commonly engulfs fragments of the host dolostone and saddle dolomite (Fig. 8e) and can be found in contact with etched margins of replacive dolomite and\/or saddle dolomite crystals indicating that host rock dissolution preceded its precipitation. Partly dissolved stylolites filled with these cements, and related to brecciation, typically branch away from faults (Fig. 8b).\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nStylolites and stylolite networks as diagenetic reaction baffles\/inhibitors\nThe Benic\u00e0ssim case study demonstrates how individual stylolites and anastomosing networks of stylolites can act as vertical (and sometimes also lateral) baffles for successive diagenetic reactions (Fig. 9\n). This section discusses several aspects of this relationship from their timing to the role of stylolites as baffles for dolomitization, dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization reactions at multiple scales.\n\n6.1.1\nRelative timing of stylolite formation versus dolomitization\nThe statistical analysis of stylolite types and their distributions presented in Humphrey et al. (2020) shows how the vast majority of stylolites in the Benic\u00e0ssim area are of the suture-and-sharp peak and wave-like type. Both types of stylolites grow in a non-linear fashion, present a low roughness and can potentially collect insoluble material (Koehn et al., 2016). Therefore, according to the morphology and formation conditions of these two stylolite types (i.e., absence of pinning structures and rare straight teeth), they should have a relatively high sealing potential compared to the other stylolite types (i.e., rectangular layer and seismogram pinning). These observations corroborate results of drill core sample studies by Vandeginste and John (2013) from the Canterbury Basin (offshore New Zealand).\nAt Benic\u00e0ssim, stylolite dolomitization fronts frequently occur in facies where stylolites form anastomosing networks (i.e., in mud-rich beds; Fig. 4b), while most of the dolostone volume replaced grainy facies units with a certain amount of mud and parallel stylolites (Fig. 9). This point is supported by the following observations: (i) dolomitized rocks tend to feature stylolite distributions similar to those of the well-sorted grainy facies (i.e., bioclastic and ooidal\/peloidal packstones and grainstones), and (ii) the systematic petrographic analysis of dolostones shows that such type of grainy facies is preferentially dolomitized (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015). Stylolite roughening tends to be favoured in grainy facies because the quenched noise of grains triggers the pinning process (e.g., see Koehn et al., 2007; Koehn et al., 2012). Accordingly, stylolites in grainy facies tend to accommodate dissolution by roughening, while strain in muddy facies can be preferentially accommodated by forming new seams instead of roughening the existing ones. Therefore, spacing of bedding-parallel stylolites is typically smaller in mud-dominated facies, favouring the formation of anastomosing networks. Anastomosis is also promoted by the cannibalization of pre-existing stylolites, a process that is also enhanced in lithofacies with grain size heterogeneity and poor sorting (Ben-Itzhak et al., 2014). At the large (half-graben) scale dolostones dominantly replace grainy limestone facies. However, stylolites control the dolomitization fronts at the outcrop scale. The presence of anastomosing stylolites in dolomitization front zones compared with the non-anastomosing character of stylolites in most dolostones can explain why the dolomitization reaction stopped at these levels and did not progress further to upper or lower strata (Fig. 9). The dolomitization fluid could invade the host limestones corresponding to facies with non-anastomosing stylolites but would be stopped in rock containing anastomosing stylolite networks that would have collectively acted as reaction baffles. This can be explained by the weaving of the reaction fronts up and down and by the stylolite distribution being very similar in the proximity of the observed fronts and on both of the front sides (see Fig. 6). Fluid flow cannot easily bypass anastomosing stylolites, as they abut on other stylolites thus inhibiting fluids infiltrating laterally. Dewit et al. (2014) described high-temperature dolostone bodies bounded by a unit of thick-bedded bioclastic wackestone alternating with nodular limestone beds. They interpreted that this massive limestone acted as an impermeable unit and that dolomitizing fluids could only overcome it by flowing through faults. In our case, wackestones and nodular limestones also bound dolostone, but the stylolites they host actually control the replacement reaction front locally.\n\n\n6.1.2\nStylolites and anastomosing stylolite networks as dolomitization reaction baffles\nThe fact that anastomosing stylolites acted as collective baffles to the dolomitization fluids reveals that it is the network of stylolites rather than individual ones that constrain the dolomitization reaction to one side of them by channelling fluid flow parallel to layering. Apart from the lithological control (muddy versus grainy facies), this phenomenon explains the stratabound character of the replacement reaction, as observed in many case studies of hydrothermal dolomitization (e.g., see Davies and Smith, 2006; Dewit et al., 2014). An individual stylolite by itself may not be able to constrain the diagenetic fluid, but the ensemble of partial fluid baffles in the form of a network of connected stylolites would constitute an efficient diagenetic fluid baffle. In such a scenario, a stylolite-bound volume of rock would be invaded by the diagenetic fluid that induces the replacement reaction. When the fluid overcomes the barrier of an individual stylolite, it will invade the whole the rock volume enclosed by the neighbouring stylolite, as indicated by the sequence of arrows in Fig. 5e. This mechanism of overcoming (or not) consecutive flow baffles explains why replacement is constrained by stylolites and why the front weaves up and down following them. Evidence supporting the role of anastomosing stylolites in constraining the reaction front is that such stylolite networks typically show a similar geometry and distribution in the vicinity of the front and on both sides of it (Fig. 5b). The strong continuity and lateral extension of networks of suture-and-sharp peak and wave-like stylolites contribute to the marked stratabound character of dolostone geobodies in the eastern side of the Benic\u00e0ssim half graben, where they extend laterally for at least 7\u00a0km away from the feeding faults. A similar case of kilometre-scale continuity of stylolite networks was described by Ben-Itzhak et al. (2012) in northern Israel.\nThe role of stylolites as dolomitization reaction baffles observed in outcrop becomes more complex at the small scale. Petrographic observations from optical and SEM show how reaction fronts enforce a certain width. This width can range from a few tens of microns when the front is formed by a single stylolite (Fig. 6f) to a few millimetres when it is constrained by two consecutive stylolites (Fig. 6b). However, individual stylolites tend to be more discrete planes when found either in limestone or dolostone, but become a more diffuse pressure-solution zone when they coincide with the dolomitization front, forming a transition zone in which both calcite and dolomite crystals can be found (Fig. 6b,d).\nSimilar observations of stylolites bounding dolostones were described by Narkiewicz (1979) in a case study of hydrothermal dolomitization of Upper Devonian carbonates from Southern Poland. This author suggested that stylolites, especially horse tail ones (i.e., wave like), formed a barrier to dolomitization, and that stylolites within limestones contain dispersed dolomite rhombohedra. Narkiewicz (1979) also described how in certain cases the replacement front is gradual over a few centimetres, a feature that we have also observed at the petrographic (mm) scale. Miller and Folk (1994) also described stylolite-controlled burial dolomitization of the uppermost Triassic Portoro Limestone of Liguria (Italy). These authors interpreted that dolomitization fluids were fed by faults and then were buffered in their proximity. They also observed dolostones systematically bounded by bedding-parallel (wispy) stylolites, which clearly pre-date dolomitization, as in our case study. Miller and Folk (1994) also observed partial dolomitization in between two consecutive stylolites, in a way that one stylolite could not constrain the reaction, but the following stylolite could halt it. This represents another example in which the stylolite network rather than individual stylolites controlled the progress of the replacement reaction. Thus, the case studies of Narkiewicz (1979) and Miller and Folk (1994) share very similar characteristics with the Benic\u00e0ssim outcrops, in terms of the dolomitization mechanism, type of stylolites and arrangement of dolomitization fronts with regard to stylolite networks.\nThe stylolites analyzed with SEM in this study do not contain a continuous insoluble residue (Fe oxides and clay minerals). Accordingly, it is not the presence of impermeable insoluble minerals that stops the flow of the dolomitization fluid, or at least it is not the only mechanism. Instead, there should be a different mechanism to explain why the dolomitization reaction can be constrained by stylolites. A potential explanation is that dolomitization can be constrained when it reaches a surface in which the characteristics of carbonate grains are different. Differences can be a consequence of local variations in mineral composition of the carbonate components (e.g., high-Mg calcite or low-Mg calcite), different reactive surface area or surface energy when there are partially dissolved crystal facets (e.g., Hadjittofis et al., 2021), and the presence of small amounts of insoluble material. In such a scenario a rough surface resulting from chemical dissolution can potentially act as a baffle and not allow the reaction front to progress, without the need of a continuous volume of insoluble and impermeable residue.\nThe progressive lateral jump of the dolomitization front up and down between neighbouring stylolites reveals that a single stylolite may not act as an insurmountable barrier to transport, but the statistical combination of multiple barriers in the form of a connected stylolite network can stop a diagenetic reaction. The overall distribution of stylolites can define anisotropy of permeability at the metre to kilometre scale, and thus result in anisotropy of advective transport (Fig. 9). Additionally, the merging or cannibalization of stylolites during the formation of anastomosing networks can enhance the porosity heterogeneity and can also help explain to their role as dolomitization reaction baffles. This process can enhance the concentration of insoluble material where pressure solution is focused on anastomosing stylolite zones within mud-rich limestones. In such situations stylolites are not only baffles to vertical fluid flow but also to horizontal transport. Peacock et al. (2017) demonstrate by means of numerical models how the progressive addition and interaction of stylolites during the progressive formation of bedding-parallel stylolite networks can result in porosity heterogeneity, in a way that porosity can be lower close to stylolites and higher away from them.\n\n\n6.1.3\nStylolites as dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization reaction baffles\nExamples of stylolites separating two dolomite textures have also been found in the Benic\u00e0ssim area (see Fig. 6). This indicates that pressure-solution structures also acted as baffles for diagenetic fluids producing recrystallization at the small scale (Fig. 9). RD2 crystals have a slightly depleted oxygen isotopic composition compared to RD1, and this was interpreted to result from a higher temperature fluid (Allan and Wiggins, 1993; Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015). Compared to dolomitization, the process of dolomite recrystallization is heterogeneous and its lateral and vertical extent is difficult to quantify in the field.\nThe role of stylolites as dolomite calcitization reaction baffles is not as systematic as that of dolomitization fluid flow barriers, because the process of synchronous dolomite dissolution and calcite precipitation is normally widespread and heterogeneous, according to the literature (e.g., see review article by Schoenherr et al., 2018 and references therein). This is also the case for calcitization in the Benic\u00e0ssim area, where it has been interpreted as related to the infiltration of meteoric water and therefore restricted to subaerially exposed rock volumes (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2015). Calcitization in the Benic\u00e0ssim area is associated with dolomite dissolution because this process resulted in a texture change with the calcitized dolomite having a cavernous texture (with millimetre-sized cavities), as previously described by Ayora et al. (1998), and occasionally coarse grained. A close look at dolomite calcitization fronts at the microscale indicates that this process is progressive, as revealed by the strong variability in its intensity depending on the sample chosen or even within the same sample (Fig. 7). The presence of stylolites acting as barriers to dolomite calcitization fluids has also been reported in studies of mudstones of the Zechstein Ca2 Stassfurt carbonate of the Southern Permian Basin in NW Germany (Koehn et al., 2016; Schoenherr et al., 2018; Humphrey et al., 2019). Although the extent and distribution of dolomite recrystallization and calcitization products are difficult to quantify, the Benic\u00e0ssim case study demonstrates that stylolites can act as barriers for these fluids. Geochemical and reactive transport models suggest that dolomite calcitization is a relatively slow diagenetic reaction, which takes tens to thousands of years to partly replace significant rock volumes (Escorcia et al., 2013). In such a scenario, stylolites can control the permeability of the calcitizing rock and thus locally determine the distribution of the resulting product (Fig. 9).\n\n\n\n6.2\nStylolites as diagenetic fluid flow conduits\nStylolitic porosity in the study area is filled with saddle dolomite and blocky calcite cements (Fig. 8), indicating that some stylolites were open at some stage and acted as conduits for the fluids (Fig. 9). Cemented stylolite porosity is only found within dolostones (i.e., not in non-replaced limestones) and in the proximity of faults. Field and petrographic observations indicate that stylolitic porosity was enhanced by dissolution, and later cemented first by saddle dolomite, which rims the stylolitic pore space, and then by blocky calcite cement. Therefore, this cemented secondary porosity is extremely localized and overall has a very limited volume (e.g., that of the dolostone and burial calcite cements filling such stylolitic porosity). Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al. (2018) studied these cements and concluded that both resulted from the flow of high-temperature brines. Moreover, hydraulic brecciation took place synchronously with cementation because clasts of replacive dolostone and saddle dolomite are engulfed by blocky calcite crystals (Fig. 8e). This type of brecciation (J\u00e9brak, 1997) indicates that fluids were overpressured. The processes of dissolution, saddle dolomite cementation, hydraulic brecciation and blocky calcite cementation probably took place a long time after dolomitization, either during the early Paleocene ore deposit formation event or during the Alpine compression stage (Eocene to mid Oligocene; Salas et al., 2001). As explained in section 3, the Alpine orogeny in the study area is characterized by the presence of calcite veins and occasional tectonic stylolites that formed because of horizontal to subhorizontal compression during two different stages (Gomez-Rivas et al., 2012). Following the model of Staude et al. (2009), the circulation of hot fluids would have been triggered by a reduction of the overburden pressure, while horizontal to subhorizontal compression could have contributed to the opening of stylolites next to faults. In such a scenario hot and overpressured fluids would flow through these structures causing dissolution, brecciation and cementation (Mart\u00edn-Mart\u00edn et al., 2018). Some of these stylolites belong to the same network as those bounding dolomitization fronts. Accordingly, stylolites can exhibit a dual behaviour, first acting as baffles and later as conduits for diagenetic fluids, depending on the burial conditions and the characteristics of the diagenetic fluids.\nThe role of stylolites as conduits for diagenetic fluids in diverse diagenetic settings has been documented in the literature. Stacey et al. (2021) described low-amplitude stylolites cross-cutting (and thus post-dating) four phases of hydrothermal replacive dolomite in the Middle Cambrian Cathedral Fm of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, and how they are filled with a late dolomite cement. As in the case of Benic\u00e0ssim, these authors relate this cement to hydraulic breccias related to fluid volume expansion. Barnett et al. (2015) observed stylolites acting as conduits for mesogenetic corrosive fluids, as well as for the formation of secondary microporosity offshore Mumbai (India). Chandra et al. (2014) also observed dissolution associated with transport along stylolites in a giant Paleogene reservoir. They describe how stylolites and related tension gashes were opened during tectonic uplift and served as conduits for reactive fluids that dissolved the host rock and delivered sulphides, silica and aluminium. As in the Benic\u00e0ssim case study, they also suggest that such fluids could have been fed by faults. Olierook et al. (2014) described a case study in which stylolites contain halos of quartz cements and are sealed in fault zones. Braithwaite (1989) proposed fluid overpressure as a key mechanism to enhance permeability along stylolites, while Paganoni et al. (2016) reported a case study in an Abu Dhabi hydrocarbon reservoir where hot brines and oil migrated along stylolites during horizontal compression. They found that such brines resulted in precipitation of carbonates, clays and other minerals around stylolites, changing their role from conduits during brine flow to their present-day behaviour as barriers to vertical fluid flow. The Benic\u00e0ssim case of stylolites acting as conduits for high-temperature overpressured fluids shares key similarities with all these studies, showing how a change of burial, stress and fluid pressure conditions can switch their impact on permeability and thus on diagenetic reaction patterns.\nThe present study shows an integrated example of how stylolites and stylolite networks can control the distribution of diagenetic reactions from the millimetre to the metre and even kilometre scales. The successive dual behaviour of stylolites and stylolite networks at Benic\u00e0ssim as baffles and conduits for fluids depending on the burial and stress conditions, as well as the host rock characteristics, is summarized in Fig. 9. Understanding this dual behaviour has key implications not only to unravel the diagenetic history of an area, but also in terms of societal challenges. Stylolites can play a role in petroleum migration and entrapment systems (Dunnington, 1954; Ehrenberg et al., 2016), ore deposit distribution (Tucker, 2015; Humphrey et al., 2019) and can also potentially control mineral reactions in geothermal reservoirs or CO2 storage sites. This contribution reveals how the presence of insoluble material is not the only control on the transport behaviour of stylolites, but how studying networks of stylolites is as important as analysing individual ones. Further systematic work is required to fully understand how these structures determine fluid migration and mineral reactions.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nThe main conclusions of this study are:\n\n1.\nIndividual stylolites can act as baffles\/inhibitors for different types of diagenetic carbonate reactions. We report examples of stylolites acting as fronts for dolomitization, dolomite recrystallization and dolomite calcitization reactions.\n\n\n2.\nNetworks of anastomosing bedding-parallel stylolites, rather than individual stylolites, can control the geometries and extent of large-scale, metre- to kilometre-scale diagenetic alterations, such as dolomitization. The replacive dolomitization reaction at Benic\u00e0ssim was controlled by stylolite networks in a way that the stratabound dolomitization front weaves up and down following consecutive anastomosing stylolites depending on whether the reactive fluid could or could not overcome the baffles formed by stylolites. The anastomosing network acted as a collective baffle in mud-dominated limestone facies, preventing them from undergoing replacement by dolomite. In contrast, most dolostone units have parallel and non-anastomosing stylolite networks, which correspond mostly to limestones dominated by grainy facies.\n\n\n3.\nStylolites acting as diagenetic reaction barriers lack a continuous seam of insoluble material at the microscale, and are normally a few tens to hundreds of microns wide. Their role as reaction baffles\/inhibitors must then be due to their different reactive surface area or slight variations in carbonate mineral composition compared to the reacting limestone components.\n\n\n4.\nSome of the same stylolites that were baffles to fluids subsequently acted as fluid conduits when the tectonic stress, burial conditions and\/or fluid pressure changed. At Benic\u00e0ssim, stylolites within dolostones close to faults are partly dissolved and filled with saddle dolomite riming the stylolite pore and high-temperature blocky calcite filling most of the remaining porosity. The fluids responsible for these reactions are interpreted to have been released at high pressure, also causing hydraulic brecciation. Stylolites are also found filled with iron oxides resulting from the dolomite calcitization process associated with meteoric fluids.\n\n\n\n\n","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":""},"Creator":{"0":["Harzhauser, Mathias","Kranner, Matthias","Mandic,

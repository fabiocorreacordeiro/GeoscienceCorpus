Ancient orogens offer a favourable setting to isolate the contribution of lithology, as tectonically driven rock uplift is typically negligible and rock strength variability can exert a critical role on the evolution of the topography. The Anti-Atlas in NW Africa is a late Paleozoic orogen comprising a well-preserved, elevated, relict landscape delimited by non-lithological knickpoints, that was uplifted during a regional late Cenozoic phase of topographic rejuvenation. Here, we combine a geomorphic analysis with 10Be-derived denudation rates to quantify bedrock erodibility and get insight into the surface evolution of the Anti-Atlas and the adjacent Siroua Massif. Specifically, we show that 10Be basin-wide denudation rates for the relict landscape are rather uniform and range from 5 to 12 m\/Myr. These rates agree with long-term rates estimated from different methods suggesting that the relict topography archives erosional quasi-erosional steady-state conditions at least since the latest Cretaceous. The uniformly low 10Be denudation rates in the relict topography are consistent despite the variability in channel steepness and topographic relief that correlates with changes in rock type. The expansion of this analysis to the denudation rates of the downstream portion of the landscape, allows to demonstrate a linear relationship between denudation and channel steepness for catchments draining quartz bearing lithologies. This provides the chance to constrain a narrow range of bedrock erodibility values for different rock-types (quartzite, granitic and sedimentary rocks). These values are comparable with estimates from other slowly deforming settings. Specifically, our compilation from tectonically inactive to slow tectonic regions indicates that bedrock erodibility does not change significantly across different climatic zones and precipitation regimes. This highlights the critical role of lithology in controlling the production of topographic relief in post-orogenic\/slow tectonic settings. Finally, we calculate the predicted denudation rates for the steeper portions of the landscape that adjusted to the new uplift rates based on the linear correlation between erosion rates and normalized steepness indices. These rates range from 20 to 50 m\/Myr and agree with the direct measurements from two catchments.\n               ","1":"\n                  Dissolved Rare Earth Elements (REE) and radiogenic neodymium (Nd) isotope composition (\u03b5\n                     Nd) of seawater are widely used geochemical tools in studying marine processes, but their modern ocean budgets are poorly understood. Recent discoveries of large benthic fluxes of REE with unique \u03b5\n                     Nd signatures from marine sediments, particularly in the deep-sea, have led to a \u201cbottom-up\u201d hypothesis, which suggests that early diagenesis below the sediment-water interface (SWI) controls the ocean's REE and \u03b5\n                     Nd budgets. To investigate such sedimentary processes, we created a reactive-transport model for the biogeochemical cycling of Nd and \u03b5\n                     Nd in marine sediments. Here, we attempt to quantify the roles of authigenesis, marine silicate weathering and reverse weathering in the diagenetic cycling of Nd and \u03b5\n                     Nd at a deep-sea (3000 m) site on the Oregon margin.\n                  Our model predicts that, at this site, Nd carried by Fe\/Mn oxides into sediments eventually transforms to authigenic Nd-phosphate, during which \u223c9% of the incoming solid Nd flux is released as a dissolved benthic flux back to the overlying bottom water. We also find that the classic reversible scavenging formulation applied to Nd co-cycling with Fe\/Mn oxides is inconsistent with the data. Rather, a co-precipitation formulation, assuming Nd is structurally incorporated into Fe\/Mn oxides, successfully simulates the data. The model also shows that authigenesis alone cannot explain the pore water and authigenic \u03b5\n                     Nd, which are both more radiogenic than bottom water at this site. However, the weathering of volcanic silicates sourced from the local subduction zone can successfully explain \u03b5\n                     Nd. We suggest that, because reverse weathering by authigenic clay formation maintains the under-saturation of primary silicates in pore water, marine silicate weathering can proceed. The processes we model likely affect the sedimentary cycling of many other trace elements and isotopes, with much broader implications for the understanding of ocean biogeochemistry.\n               ","2":"\n                  China's Chang'E-5 (CE-5) mission has collected 1.731 kg samples from a young mare basalt unit (named P58\/EM4) in the northeastern Oceanus Procellarum region of the Moon. Accurate tracing of the provenance of returned samples is essential for understanding their laboratory measurements, which can provide critical information about the Moon and the inner Solar System. In this article, the provenance, chemical composition, formation, and evolution processes of the regolith at the CE-5 landing site are analyzed by using remote sensing observations and crater ejecta deposition models. A comprehensive search based on crater ejecta thickness model shows that 1892 impact craters in P58 likely deposited \u223c0.56 m of primary ejecta at the landing site, whereas 4 impact craters outside P58 deposited 0.05 m of distal ejecta that further excavated and reworked \u223c0.5 m thick local mare basalt. Twelve craters within 1 km from the CE-5 landing site are estimated to contribute \u223c0.49 m (~88%) of the ejecta materials, and their ejecta source regions are investigated using the Maxwell Z model. Among these 12 craters, Xu Guangqi and a smaller crater near the landing site are the two most volumetrically significant contributors (~0.3 m and \u223c0.12 m). Craters more than 1 km distant from the landing site deposited fewer exotic materials, but some of them could have delivered low-Ti materials to the sampling site. Finally, the regolith stratigraphy at the landing site is investigated based on the identified and assumed impact sequence by using a Monte Carlo-based ejecta ballistic sedimentation model. The results reveal a depth-varying FeO\/TiO2 abundance profile at the landing site, suggesting that the sedimentation of distant ejecta can reduce FeO\/TiO2 abundance of the underlying layer by \u223c1 wt.% at \u223c0.5 m depth. Our results provide key information on sample provenance and regolith stratigraphy of the landing site, which is crucial to deciphering the returned CE-5 samples.\n               ","3":"\n                  The 900-km-long Yushu-Ganzi-Xianshuihe fault system that separates the Bayan Har and Qiangtang\/Chuandian blocks is a primary tectonic structure in central eastern Tibet. Being one of the world's most seismically active fault systems, it hosted 12 \n                        M\n                        >\n                        7\n                      earthquakes since the 18th century, and its future seismic risk has been the subject of extensive research over the past two decades. Previous studies have suggested that the western segment of the fault system differs largely from its eastern segment in strain accumulation and release, but the origin of such difference remains unknown. Here we use Sentinel-1 data to produce a complete map of present-day deformation for the entire fault system, in order to explore the along-strike variation in fault slip behaviour. Based on the InSAR deformation map, we solve for fault kinematic parameters including slip rate, locking depth and dip angle using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo inversion approach. Slip rate on the Dangjiang-Yushu-Ganzi fault is consistently \u223c5\u20136 mm\/yr, only half of that on the Xianshuihe fault. This rate difference originates from nonuniform deformation mechanism within the Bayan Har block, with the western part of the block deforming more rigidly than the eastern part. Both historical and modern earthquake catalogues show that the western fault segment has only recorded \n                        M\n                        >\n                        7\n                      earthquakes whereas the eastern segment has seen many small-to-moderate ruptures in addition to large earthquakes. These observations imply that the western fault segment may be more structurally mature than the eastern segment, which agrees with the long-term fault propagation as indicated by geochronological data and fault geometrical complexities. We calculate the seismic moment deficits along the fault system and find that several segments, e.g. the Dangjiang fault and the Manigange segment of the Ganzi fault, have accumulated a large seismic moment (equates to an \n                        \n                           \n                              M\n                           \n                           \n                              w\n                           \n                        \n                        >\n                        7\n                      earthquake) since the last major event.\n               ","4":"\n                  The mechanisms of short-term (105\u2013106 years) and high-magnitude (>20 m) sea-level oscillations have long been debated involving glacio- and aquifer-eustasy, largely owing to the sparse robust evidence for the presence and significance of aquifer-eustasy, and lack of knowledge about the hydrological dynamics behind it. Non-marine\/continental greenhouse archives (e.g., lake level) and their temporal correlation to marine successions (e.g., sea level) could provide clues to aquifer-eustasy. The Songliao Basin (SLB) in Northeast China is one of the largest Mesozoic terrestrial inland basins and provides a terrestrial archive of nearly all Cretaceous successions. The greenhouse late Santonian\u2013early Campanian lower Nenjiang Formation (K2n1+2), recovered from three boreholes in the SLB, provides a unique opportunity for validating and decoding aquifer-eustasy. Initially, the cyclostratigraphy of logging gamma ray (GR) and thorium (Th) series from three boreholes was implemented, which in conjunction with precise geochronological (U\/Pb zircon) ages renewed the chronology framework of the SLB. Using the astronomically tuned GR and Th datasets, the lake level of the SLB, which was recovered from sedimentary noise modeling and presented as a proxy for the water table of the groundwater reservoir, showed a clear out-of-phase relationship with the coeval sea level, validating the aquifer-eustasy hypothesis. The lake level of SLB shows prominent \u223c1.2 Myr cycles and a well-coupled relationship with sea level and obliquity modulation, indicating that orbital obliquity drove the lake level and modulated water exchange between ocean and continent during the Cretaceous greenhouse period.

The close correlation between the reported marine incursion layers and the lowstand of sea level casts a doubt on the marine incursion hypothesis in the SLB; thus, more work is needed to reconcile this paradox. Overall, this study provides the first robust geological evidence for aquifer-eustasy and decodes its role in Cretaceous short-term eustasy.\n               ","5":"\n                  The target is the non-secular, non-seasonal, interannual ice-mass redistribution over the Antarctica continent, as observed by the satellite mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) for the period from 2002 to 2016. We employ the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and complex EOF (CEOF) methods on the GRACE monthly time-variable gravity in the form of the mascon data. We find three separate phenomena on different timescales that are hitherto unreported: (i) EOF Mode 1 represents an interannual standing \u201cseesaw\u201d pattern largely concentrates along the coast, which we refer to as the Antarctica Coastal Dipole (ACD), with turnarounds coincident with ENSO events, relative to precipitation anomalies, whereas Mode 2-3 both correlate with the Antarctica Oscillation (AAO); (ii) the leading CEOF Mode shows two different propagating waves, one is the Eastward Propagation (EP) with the periodicity of \u223c4.7 years most evident in the East Antarctica, may be induced by the Antarctica Circumpolar Wave; (iii) another is a Westward Propagation (WP) with \u223c2 years periodicity in the West Antarctica that mainly travels from the Ronnie Ice Shelf to the Ross Ice Shelf, may relate to AAO.\n               ","6":"\n                  Paleointensity data can yield insight on the state of the geodynamo, providing constraints on deep Earth events and enabling analysis of long-term trends in the paleomagnetic field. The Ediacaran (635 Ma\u2013539 Ma) is a period of discrepant paleomagnetic behaviour that was recently characterised by sustained, extremely weak, paleointensity. The interval also coincides with some of the most recent estimates for Earth's inner core nucleation (ICN) age, determined from numerical geodynamo models and analysis of long-term paleointensity data. However, the field strength during the subsequent Cambrian period (540 Ma\u2013485 Ma) is largely unknown with almost no data.\n                  Here, we provide high-quality paleointensity results for the Cambrian. A Grenville dyke (\u223c590 Ma) that was baked by the Chatham-Grenville stock (532 Ma), slowly cooled at a rate controlled by the stock and recorded the paleointensity averaged over this interval (up to several tens of thousands of years). The characteristic paleomagnetic directions of the dyke are well-defined and consistent with those previously obtained from the Chatham-Grenville and Mont Riguad stocks.\n                  Paleointensity data were obtained using multiple methods and indicate an extremely weak field during a period coincidental with evidence for hyper-reversing activity extending into the late Cambrian. The dipole strength is similar to that of the \u2018ultra-weak\u2019 Ediacaran and may suggest that this paleomagnetic behaviour persisted into the Cambrian.

However, the relative importance of these two mechanisms has not hitherto been quantified. In this study, applying Gaussian Process regression to reconstruct irregular seamount topography above and under the sedimentary layer, we calculate an accurate map of volcanism distribution within the Pacific plate. We find that previous erupted volumes have been underestimated by 75% on average. Our results show that (1) the total erupted volume postulated to be plume-related makes up only 18% of total Pacific intraplate volcanism, and (2) the volume statistics for plume-related seamounts and those along the Large Low-Shear-Velocity Province margins are nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the intraplate seamounts. We conclude that proposed plumes account for only a minority of the volume of intraplate volcanism in the Pacific plate, implying that shallow rather than deep processes are dominant.\n               ","8":"\n                  Aeolian bedforms are the signatures of wind interaction with unconsolidated, granular surface materials. Transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) are widely distributed on Mars but their formation remains enigmatic. China's Zhurong rover explored four crescent-shaped TARs, with two horns generally facing south, during the first 107 sols in southern Utopia Planitia, Mars. Rover images show that these bedforms have distinct light and dark variations on their surfaces that likely result from the combination of a bimodal distribution of particle sizes and the crust formed by the accumulation of aeolian dust. Two of these bedforms exhibit erosional forms on their west sides, where megaripples facing in a direction different from that of the crescentic bedforms they disrupt were created by more recent winds from the northeast. Differing erosional configurations of each of these bedforms in close proximity to each other are probably related to the angle between the bedform crest and the wind direction, and may further suggest that erosion of TARs starts from their two flanks. Secondary ridges of TARs widely recognized on Mars could be megaripples formed during this erosion process. At the Zhurong landing site, TARs degraded into megaripples, suggesting that they might share similar formation and evolution mechanisms there and elsewhere on Mars.\n               ","9":"\n                  The formation and dissolution of salt giants impacts ocean chemistry on thousand-million year timescales. Gypsum precipitation and weathering changes the oceanic calcium concentration with implications for the carbon cycle and global temperatures. However, the connectivity of salt giants with the global ocean is necessarily restricted, making the timing of Ca2+ extraction and return more uncertain. Here we reconstruct the final phase of gypsum precipitation of the Late Miocene Mediterranean Salt Giant using micropaleontology, sedimentology and 87Sr\/86Sr analyses on the most complete record preserved at Eraclea Minoa on Sicily and explore its implications for global climate. Precessional gypsum-marl couplets (Upper Gypsum) characterize the last 200 kyrs (Stage 3) of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC; 5.97\u20135.332 Ma) in both intermediate (500\u20131000 m) and deep (>1000 m) Mediterranean basins. The interbedded selenitic gypsum layers contain well-preserved calcareous nannofossil assemblages dominated by Reticulofenestra minuta, a marine species which tolerates stressful conditions. Marine water is also required to explain the gypsum 87Sr\/86Sr data, which describe a small range of ratios (0.708704\u20130.708813) lower than coeval ocean water. Mass-balance calculations indicate that during gypsum precipitation, the Atlantic made up \u226420% of a Mediterranean (\u201cLago-Mare\u201d) water mass dominated by low salinity discharge from large river systems and Eastern Paratethys. This suggests episodic extraction of calcium and sulfate ions from the ocean throughout MSC Stage 3. The marls commonly contain shallow (30\u2013100 m) brackish-water ostracods of Paratethyan (Black Sea) origin. Marls with Paratethyan ostracods are also found in both marginal (<500 m) and deep Mediterranean settings. This indicates that marl-deposition was not synchronous across the basin, but that it occurred in intermediate and deep basins during base-level lowstands at insolation minima and on the shallow Mediterranean margins during insolation maxima-driven highstands. These high-amplitude base-level fluctuations exposed the evaporites to weathering, but ponded the products in the Mediterranean basin until reconnection occurred at the beginning of the Pliocene.\n               ","10":"\n                  Impact-related damage in minerals and rocks provides key evidence to identify impact structures, and deformation of U-Th-minerals in target rocks, such as monazite, makes possible precise dating and determination of pressure-temperature conditions for impact events. Here a laser-driven shock experiment using a high-energy laser pulse of ns-order duration was carried out on a natural monazite crystal to compare experimentally produced shock-deformation microstructures with those observed in naturally shocked monazite. Deformation microstructures from regions that may have experienced up to \u223c50 GPa and 1000\u00b0C were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Experimental results were compared with nanoscale observations of deformation microstructures found in naturally shocked monazite from the Vredefort impact structure (South Africa). Raman-band broadening observed between unshocked and shocked monazite, responsible for a variation of \u223c3 cm\u22121 in the FWHM, is interpreted to result from the competition between shock-induced distortion of the lattice, and post-shock annealing. At nanoscale, three main plastic deformation structures were found in both naturally and experimentally shocked monazite: deformation twins, mosa\u00efcism, and deformation bands. The element Ca is enriched along host-twin boundaries, which further confirms that the laser shock loading experiment produced both comparable styles of crystal-plastic deformation, and also localized element mobility, as that found in natural shock-deformed monazite. Deformation twins form in the experiment were only along the (001) plane, an orientation which is not considered diagnostic of shock deformation. However, both mosa\u00efcism and deformation, expressed in SAED patterns as streaking of spots, and the presence of extra spots (more or less pronounced), are interpreted as unambiguous nano-scale signatures of shock metamorphism in monazite. Experimentally calibrated deformation features, such as those documented here at TEM-scale, provide new tools for identifying evidence of shock deformation in natural samples.\n               ","11":"\n                  Long-term relationships between stream chemistry and discharge are regulated by watershed subsurface structure and biogeochemical functioning.

The VGP path includes centuries during which the VGP position is stable and centuries during which its motion accelerates. We recognize both clockwise and counterclockwise VGP paths, mostly developing inside the surface projection of the inner core tangent cylinder in the Arctic region. The VGP path seems to follow the appearance of Br patches of normal magnetic flux, especially those located under Siberia and Canada areas, but also those that may cause peculiar paleomagnetic features such as the Levantine Iron Age Anomaly.\n               ","13":"\n                  Understanding magma genesis and the evolution of intensive parameters (temperature, pressure, composition, degree of melting) in the mantle source of highly active volcanic systems is crucial for interpreting magma supply changes over time and recognizing cyclic behavior to anticipate future volcanic behavior. Major and trace elements in olivine are commonly used to study variations in mantle lithologies and melting conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) affecting the mantle over time. Here, we track the temporal evolution of primary melts through the most recent cycle of explosive and effusive eruptions at K\u012blauea (Hawai\u2018i), which spans the last \u223c500 years. We report major and trace elements in olivine from the last explosive period (\u223c1500 \u2013 early 1820\u2019s Keanak\u0101ko\u2018i Tephra) and the most recent decade of the current effusive period (2018 LERZ, 2015\u20132018 Pu\u2018u\u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d, 2008\u20132018 lava lake and 2020 eruption in Halema\u2018uma\u2018u). Scandium concentrations in olivine allow characterizing changes in mantle source between 1500 and 2018, and suggest that the recent (2015\u20132018) magma feeding the Pu\u2018u\u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d cone did not significantly interact with the magma that erupted in the LERZ in 2018. The evolution of olivine and melt compositions over the past 500 years is not easily reconcilable with variations in mantle potential temperature, pressure of mantle melt pooling and storage, or oxygen fugacity. Instead, Sc, Mn, and Co concentrations and Ni\/Mg ratio in high forsterite (Fo >87) olivine advocate for an increase in the proportion of clinopyroxene in the mantle source associated with a slightly higher degree of partial melting from 1500 to 2018. Changes in primitive melt compositions and degrees of mantle melting may well modulate magma supply to the crust and formation-replenishment of steady or ephemeral summit reservoirs, and thereby control transitions between explosive and effusive periods at K\u012blauea. Analyzing trace elements in olivine at K\u012blauea and elsewhere could therefore provide important clues on subtle changes occurring at the mantle level that might herald changes in volcanic behavior.\n               ","14":"\n                  Melting properties of the deep mantle remain controversial due to experimental difficulties; e.g., reports of solidus temperatures of mantle-relevant compositions span over \u223c700 K at 2000 km depth. This situation limits our understanding of the thermochemical state of the Earth's interior. Using the laser heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC), we performed new experimental determination of the solidus profile of ultra-dry pyrolite and the solidus of two compositions of (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3 bridgmanite (Bg). Melting was detected (i) from -the correlation between laser power and sample temperature, -changes of sample texture and -the level of visible light absorption, for all samples, (ii) using X-ray diffraction, for the MgSiO3 composition and (iii) after scanning electron microscope observations, for selected Fe-bearing samples. Special care was given to using ultra-dry experimental chambers and to determination of sample temperature. In particular, we discuss the wavelength-dependent thermal emission of silicate samples, which lowers the solidus by 100 to 300 K, compared to the grey-body assumption.\n                  The solidus of MgSiO3-Bg is in good agreement with previous reports using ab initio calculations and shock wave experiments. We observe a net decrease in the solid-liquid Clapeyron slope at 60(3) GPa and 4400(200) K, which can be related to rapid pressure-induced coordination change of Si in the melt. (Mg0.955,Fe0.045)(Si0.993,Al0.007)O3 Bg melts 600\u2013800 K lower than MgSiO3-Bg. Its solidus evolves smoothly with pressure, suggesting progressive Si coordination change in the melt. In the pressure range investigated (24\u2013135 GPa) Clapeyron slopes suggest rapid decrease of the volume of fusion, from 14 to 2% for MgSiO3 and from 9 to 3% for (Fe,Al)-bearing Bg, assuming congruent melting. By comparing the solidii of various silicates, it appears that the higher the number of cations, the less pronounced is the curvature of the solidus. This observation suggests that the relatively ordered structure of simple liquid compositions with a limited number of distinct network-modifying cations frustrates the coexistence of tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Si polyhedral.\n                  The solidus of pyrolite presents a smooth evolution from 2200(100) K to 3950(200) K in the same pressure interval. This is very similar to our previous work on chondritic-type mantle. The new solidus is 200\u2013300 K lower than that of KLB-1 peridotite, which can be related to more incompatible elements in pyrolite. It remains problematic that our solidus plots several 100 K higher than other recent measurements performed on pyrolite; we discuss the possibility of a higher water content in previous samples, compared to our experiments. Assuming a dry lowermost mantle, our results imply a core-mantle boundary temperature lower than 3950(200) K. Modeling the melting diagram at the core-mantle boundary suggests a pseudo-eutectic melt significantly depleted in SiO2, compared to the composition of the mean mantle.\n               ","15":"\n                  The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is a complex and poorly understood region of the Earth. The existence of melt or partial melt at the CMB is strongly debated with evidence coming from a range of sources. While partial melt has been inferred in specific locations using seismology, often as an explanation for ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs), no global layer of melt has been observed despite evidence that such melt should accumulate at the CMB.\n                  Using high frequency synthetic seismograms we have systematically examined the effect of a one-dimensional melt layer at the CMB on the global seismic wavefield. We find that PKKP diffracted waves are an extremely sensitive, robust and previously underutilised seismic phase for studying the CMB and, in synthetic testing, could resolve very thin melt layers. We have constructed a global data set of PKKP diffracted observations to attempt to observe or exclude melt at the CMB. We find that within the bounds of our data, we are unable to robustly exclude or observe a melt layer at the CMB on the order of single kilometres thick. The presence of a thin layer of unobservable melt at the CMB would have profound impacts for the internal dynamics of the Earth.\n               ","16":"\n                  Listwaenite, a distinctive rock formed by carbonation of peridotite, is important for understanding carbon fluxes and storage in the deep Earth. In northern Oman, this lithology occurs near\/at the base of the Semail Ophiolite and has been proposed to have formed in the mantle wedge during Late Cretaceous obduction and ophiolite emplacement. Listwaenite occurs as tabular sheets associated with post-obductional extensional faults. Specifically, listwaenite formed in (1) extensional duplexes bound by shallowly-dipping normal faults, (2) moderately- to steeply-dipping extensional faults, and (3) layers that overlie rocks of the metamorphic sole and unmetamorphosed platform carbonates. Two dolomite veins cutting listwaenite yield near-identical LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of 60.3 \u00b1 15.4 and 55.1 \u00b1 4.7 Ma (2 standard error). Thus, listwaenite formed prior to or is coeval with the \u223c60-55 Ma veins. One carbonate listwaenite sample yields a LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age of 64.31 \u00b1 6.28 Ma. Further six listwaenite samples yield imprecise ages of \u223c33-3 Ma. Thus, listwaenite is interpreted to have formed during at least two post-obductional deformational events in the Oman Mountains. Hydrothermal circulation of carbon-rich fluids along upper crustal extensional faults facilitated listwaenite formation. Our results indicate that listwaenite formed during post-obductional extension, challenging models of listwaenite genesis in the mantle wedge during obduction.\n               ","17":"\n                  Whether lithospheric stress can reach the maximum level predicted by the Christmas-tree strength envelope is a fundamental question but with controversial answers. There is little controversy that a deforming lithosphere in high heat flow regions is likely critically stressed, i.e., at full yield at all depths, as described by the envelope. But different conceptual frameworks offer opposite views for very cold lithosphere, either at full yield or far below yield. Here, we use simple numerical models to investigate stresses in end-member cold cratonic lithosphere (e.g., Canadian Craton) in comparison with end-member warm plate-boundary lithosphere (e.g., Canadian Cordillera). The two key elements of our modelling are (1) that lithospheric stress builds up elastically with horizontal tectonic loading not only in the elastic\u2013frictional brittle regime but also in the viscoelastic ductile regime, and (2) that the stress level is limited by the available tectonic force. In a cratonic lithosphere, the limiting tectonic force is sustained by competent rock material over a large depth range, represented by the competent thickness Tc that exceeds 90 km. The lithosphere undergoes mostly elastic deformation at a stress level of a few tens of MPa. While weakly stressed strong lithosphere can still produce limited earthquakes at shallow depths due to structural and stress heterogeneity, the lithospheric stress under horizontal tectonic loading is theoretically predicted to be orders of magnitude lower than predicted by the Christmas-tree envelope. Stresses in a real lithosphere may substantially deviate from this theoretical level because of spatiotemporal variations in rheology and structure. For example, the stress memory of past loading history in cold lithosphere may or may not be erased by more recent tectonic stresses. Because much of previous scientific debates on lithospheric stress levels and comparison with seismicity were focused on topographically induced flexural stress, we also investigate the effect of vertical loading. We show that the effective elastic thickness Te derived from the flexural response is a reasonable proxy for Tc derived from horizontal tectonic loading; a very large Te such as > 80 km is generally associated with very low tectonic stress far below yield. However, the flexure-induced bending stress is not directly comparable with seismicity because it may either enhance or suppress seismogenic stress in the crust.\n               ","18":"\n                  The deuterium-to-hydrogen (D\/H or 2H\/1H) ratio of Martian atmospheric water (\u223c6\u00d7 standard mean ocean water, SMOW) is higher than that of known sources, requiring planetary enrichment. A recent measurement by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity of Hesperian-era (>3 Ga) clays yields a D\/H ratio \u223c3\u00d7SMOW, demonstrating that most of the enrichment occurs early in Mars's history, reinforcing the conclusions of Martian meteorite studies. As on Venus, Mars's D\/H enrichment is widely thought to reflect preferential loss to space of 1H (protium) relative to 2H (deuterium), but both the cause and the global environmental context of large and early hydrogen losses remain to be determined. Here, we apply a recent model of primordial atmosphere evolution to Mars, link the magma ocean of the accretion epoch with a subsequent water-ocean epoch, and calculate the behavior of deuterium for comparison with the observed record. In contrast to earlier works that consider Martian D\/H fractionation in atmospheres in which hydrogen reservoirs are present exclusively as H2O or H2, here we consider 2-component (H2O-H2) outgassed atmospheres in which both condensing (H2O) and escaping (H2) components \u2013 and their interaction \u2013 are explicitly calculated. We find that a \u22482-3\u00d7 hydrospheric deuterium-enrichment is produced rapidly if the Martian magma ocean is chemically reducing at last equilibration with the primordial atmosphere, making H2 and CO the initially dominant species, with minor abundances of H2O and CO2. Reducing gases \u2013 in particular H2 \u2013 can cause substantial greenhouse warming and prevent a water ocean from freezing immediately after the magma ocean epoch. We find that greenhouse warming due to plausible H2 inventories (pH\n                        \n                           \n                              =\n                           \n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                           \n                           \n                        \n                        1\n                        \u2212\n                        \n                           \n                              10\n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                           \n                        \n                      bars) yields surface temperatures high enough (T\n                        \n                           \n                              =\n                           \n                           \n                           \n                              s\n                           \n                           \n                        \n                        290\n                        \u2212\n                        560\n                      K) to stabilize a water ocean and produce an early hydrological cycle through which surface water can be circulated. Moreover, the pressure-temperature conditions are high enough to produce ocean-atmosphere H2O-H2 isotopic equilibrium through gas-phase deuterium exchange such that surface H2O strongly concentrates deuterium relative to H2, which preferentially takes up protium and escapes from the primordial atmosphere. The efficient physical separation of deuterium-rich (H2O) and deuterium-poor (H2) species via condensation permits equilibrium isotopic partitioning and early atmospheric escape to be recorded in modern crustal reservoirs. The proposed scenario of primordial H2-CO-rich outgassing and escape suggests significant durations (>Myr) of chemical conditions on the Martian surface conducive to prebiotic chemistry immediately following magma ocean crystallization.\n               ","19":"\n                  The Mg\/Ca ratio of seawater increased from \u223c1.5 to its present value of 5.4 over the Neogene, indicating a fundamental imbalance in the Mg\u2013Ca cycle during the late Cenozoic.

Their morphologies and morphometrics are investigated through high-resolution imaging science experiment (HiRISE) orthoimage and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) products. A total of 5089 TARs are identified, with barchan TARs being predominant (97.6%). Morphometric analysis shows these TARs to be small and symmetrical aeolian landforms, with an average crest\u2013ridge lengths of 33.9 \u00b1 20.5 m, profile widths of 9.4 \u00b1 3.8 m, profile heights of 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 m, profile-height-width ratios of 0.04 \u00b1 0.02, and profile symmetry ratios of \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.13. In-situ observations from the Navigation and Terrain Camera (NaTeCam) show the crests of the TARs to be dark and sharp, while the flanks are interlaced by dark and bright materials. Close-up Multispectral Camera (MSCam) images reveal the TARs to be coated by granules of \u223c1.5 mm in diameter. Given the morphometric characteristics and the presence of coating granules, the TARs in the landing area could be categorized as megaripples. Buffered crater counting (BCC) technique-derived absolute model age (AMA) reveals the formation time, or the last active period of the TARs, could be as recent as 1 Ma in the Late Amazonian. The morphometrics and direction of the horns of the barchan TARs suggest the winds for the formation of TARs blew mostly from the north. During the spring-summer transition period (Ls: 50\u00b0\u201393\u00b0), the Mars Climate Station (MCS) had recorded local bimodal winds in the landing area, with the speed of the northerly wind in the afternoon being a little stronger than the speed of the southerly wind in the morning. These observations are consistent with the wind fields described in the Mars Climate Database (MCD), which imply the northerly winds during the northern winter season to be responsible for the net sediment transport to the south. Two TARs observed in-situ with secondary NW-SE trending crest-ridges indicate that forked TARs might form given sufficient time (i.e., in the order of millions of years) under modern wind conditions, i.e., the TARs may be currently reworked, if only extremely weakly.\n               ","23":"\n                  Several studies have suggested that the Earth's upper mantle is slightly enriched in light molybdenum isotopes relative to bulk Earth, defined by chondrites, but there is no consensus on the presence of this subtle but potentially notable signature.

However, the initiation mechanisms and tectonic evolution of the Tanlu fault remain controversial, in part due to the absence of constraints from deep structures. In this study, we inverted 5\u2013150 s surface-wave dispersion data collected from 253 permanent stations and 111 temporary stations in the vicinity of the central-southern Tanlu fault and obtained both isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic shear-wave velocity (Vs) models in the crust and upper mantle simultaneously. The new Vs models reveal unprecedented multiple patterns of anomalies. There is, for example, an arc-shaped pattern of fast directions found in the South China plate (SCP), providing direct evidence of the sudden termination of the Tanlu fault at its southern end; orogen-parallel fast directions and high-velocity anomalies were detected beneath the Dabie and Sulu orogens, which are believed to be the residue of the delaminated lithosphere. Based on the evidence collected, we propose a four-stage tectonic model for the Tanlu fault. The tectonic model suggests that the area has been subjected to multiple geologic processes since the Early Mesozoic, including oceanic-continental collision, continental-continental collision, break-off of oceanic slabs, lithospheric delamination, and convective erosion resulting from corner flow. As such, the proposed tectonic model reconciles the newly discovered Vs anomalies as well as various previous findings, providing profound insight into regional deformations and the evolution of the Tanlu fault and its adjacent areas.\n               ","25":"\n                  Wrinkle ridges are important landforms on Mars and other planetary bodies and result from horizontal tectonic shortening. This study provides insights into the subsurface of selected wrinkle ridge sites, based on exposures provided by steep escarpments and crater slopes that crosscut wrinkle ridges. We mapped the complex fold and fault patterns and measured fault dips, where faults appear planar. The fault pattern underneath wrinkle ridges is diverse and is dominated by reverse faults and thrusts. The predominance of one fault system leads to morphological asymmetries of many wrinkle ridges. The upper tip of the dominant thrust fault is commonly situated beneath the steeper wrinkle ridge slope and may outcrop at its base. Polarity changes of wrinkle ridges along strike go along with a change of the dominant thrust direction. Symmetric wrinkle ridges are formed when a conjugate system of thrusts exists in the subsurface. Several wrinkle ridges display a main thrust fault whose dip angle bends over to a shallower dip at depth. The measurements of average dip for primary thrust and backthrust faults are 37\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0 and 28 \u00b1 2\u00b0, respectively. In general, most of the examined wrinkle ridges are characterized by a multitude of subsidiary and backthrust faults. With the limitation that the uppermost 500-1000 m of the wrinkle ridges subsurface are accessible in this study and despite the large morphological and structural variability of wrinkle ridges, the kinematics of fault-propagation folds models seem to show a large match to our observations and measurements. Likewise, continuum mechanics models show a good fit to the obtained structural data. Fault-bend fold models and simple buckle folding models seem less compatible with observations.\n               ","26":"\n                  Closed-basin lakes respond strongly to climate related changes in their water balance.

These new Zr isotope data reveal the same fundamental NC-CC dichotomy observed for several other elements, where CC meteorites are more anomalous compared to NC meteorites and are shifted towards the isotopic composition of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). For Zr and other elements, the CC composition is reproduced as a mixture of materials with CAI-like and NC-like isotopic compositions in approximately constant proportions, despite these elements exhibiting disparate nucleosynthetic origins or different cosmo- and geochemical behaviors. These constant mixing proportions are inconsistent with an origin of the dichotomy by thermal processing or selective dust-sorting in the disk but indicate mixing of isotopically distinct materials with broadly solar chemical compositions. This corroborates models in which the NC-CC dichotomy reflects time-varied infall from an isotopically heterogeneous molecular cloud. Among NC meteorites, the isotope anomalies in Zr are linearly correlated with those of other elements, which likewise reflects primordial mixing. Lastly, the new Zr isotope data reinforce the notion that Earth incorporated s-process enriched material from the innermost Solar System, which is not represented by known meteorites. By contrast, contributions to Earth and Mars from outer Solar System CC-like materials were limited, indicating that these planets did not form by pebble accretion, which would have led to high CC fractions.\n               ","28":"\n                  In isolated fracture networks in the Precambrian Shield, long-term water and rock interactions produce saline anoxic fluids that host extant microbial communities deep within the continental subsurface.

These estimated formation temperatures are too low for CH4 to be formed solely through thermogenic degradation of organic matter.

For extraterrestrial bodies, the crater size-frequency distribution dating method, including a crater production function and a chronology function, was established based on the radiometric ages of Apollo and Luna samples from the Moon. Recently, the radiometric age of a sample from Chang'e-5 mission added a data point where there was previously a gap in sample ages, and an updated lunar chronology function was proposed. This research aims to recalculate the Martian surface dating model from the newly updated lunar chronology function. The calculation takes account of the differences in impact rates, impact velocities, surface gravities, the threshold diameters of craters' transition from the strength to gravity regime and from simple to complex crater structures on the Moon and Mars. We use the Neukum production function, although other production functions could also be implemented with our method. A series of Martian isochrons is derived, and an approximated analytical form production function is provided for convenient applications in future studies. The Martian chronology function is finally obtained through fitting crater frequencies larger than 1.0 km in diameter with the corresponding ages of the isochrons. The resultant Martian PF and CF in this research are largely comparable with previous results. Based on the refined lunar chronology function, our model will enhance the reliability of the estimating Martian surface ages and we suggest it be used in future studies.\n               ","30":"\n                  Since the onset of plate tectonics, continents have evolved through a balance between crustal growth, reworking, and recycling at convergent plate margins. The term \u201creworking\u201d involves the re-insertion of crustal material into pre-existing crustal volumes, while crustal growth and recycling respectively represent gains from and losses to the mantle. Reworking that occurs in the mantle wedge (\u201csource\u201d contamination from slab material) or within the upper plate (\u201cpath\u201d contamination), will have contrasting effects on crustal evolution. However, due to limited access to deep crustal and mantle rocks, quantifying source vs. path contamination remains challenging. Based on the 4-dimensional record of the fossil (Ordovician) Famatinian continental arc (Argentina), we demonstrate that source contamination plays a dominant role in imprinting mafic to granitic rocks with crustal oxygen-hafnium (O-Hf) isotopic compositions. We argue that source contamination at convergent plate margins significantly increased the diversity of O-Hf isotopic signatures of continents over geologic time. Our interpretation implies that crustal evolution models attributing this isotopic diversity dominantly to intra-crustal reworking may be over-simplistic and may underestimate continental growth in the last 2.5 billion years.\n               ","31":"\n                  Core formation may modify the stable isotopic signatures for both the mantles and cores of differentiated planetary bodies.

Here we integrate new (U-Th)\/He and fission-track dates of detrital zircons with previously published thermochronology to document a significant out-of-sequence thrust in the core of Taiwan orogen. The thrust, informally named the Tayulin fault system, is identified by structural kinematics and offset metamorphic temperature trends, low-temperature thermochronometric dates, and seismic tomography. The OOST appears to be composed of three segments that crop out along the western flank of the Backbone Range. The apparent age-elevation profiles suggest a relatively slow exhumation rate, <1.0 mm\/yr, in the early stages from 8 Ma to 2 Ma followed by a stage of significantly higher exhumation rates, ranging from 2.3 to 6.5 mm\/yr after 2 Ma. The early slow exhumation stage is related to regional folding and foliation development. In contrast, we suggest the younger rapid exhumation stage is related to slip on the out-of-sequence thrust.\n               ","35":"\n                  Mars lacks ongoing tectonic activities such as volcanism and mountain-building processes. Modern plate tectonic movements on the Earth's surface are driven primarily by the descent of subducted slabs into the mantle. Slab crust made of dense eclogite metamorphosed from the Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt provides an important driving force for slab subduction. Thus, mantle convection inside Mars can be hindered if the density contrast between Martian slab crust and the ambient Martian mantle is sufficiently smaller than that of Earth. To evaluate this hypothesis, we carried out high pressure-temperature phase equilibrium experiments on three different Martian basalts: Yamato 980459, NWA 8159, and GUSEV basalt (Humphrey). The GUSEV basalt and NWA 8159 undergo partial or complete melting along the Martian areotherm due to their high Fe content, suggesting that both compositions are geochemically evolved. Yamato 980459, the nearly primitive Martian basalt, on the other hand, would transform to a low-density eclogite at a depth of \u223c250 km. The density contrast between a Martian crustal slab made of Yamato 980459, and the ambient Martian mantle is much smaller than that for Earth's mantle. Calculated slab sinking torques and velocities further suggest that sustained buoyancy-driven subduction of thin slabs was unlikely early in Martian history. Additional experiments exploring wider composition and pressure-temperature ranges are needed to fully understand the consequences of Martian mantle compositions and cooling history for the tectonic history of Mars.\n               ","36":"\n                  Understanding mantle flow is key to elucidate how deep Earth dynamics relate to tectonics at the global scale. The convective mass transport is reflected in lateral variations of the gravity field, seismic velocities, as well as deformations of the Earth's surface. Yet, upper to mid-mantle dynamics have been difficult to constrain at the medium scales of thousands of km. Here, we analyze the second-order horizontal derivatives of seafloor topography and of the gravity potential over the Pacific and Northern Indian ocean basins, and provide evidence for periodic undulations of 1600-2000 km wavelength in both signals, elongated along the direction of absolute plate motion. We investigate potential crustal and lithospheric sources and show that at least part of this signal must originate below the lithosphere, with alignments of sub-lithospheric upper mantle mass excess below seafloor lows. Furthermore, we find that these alignments coincide geographically over wide areas with similarly periodic slow seismic velocity fingers located at upper mantle depths. These two fields may thus record an intermediate scale of mantle convection below ocean basins, which cannot be explained by purely thermal convection and requires instead lateral variations in composition in the upper mantle. Elucidating the nature of the detected mass excess sources coincident with the slow seismic velocities calls for a joint dynamical modeling of all observations in a thermo-chemical context.\n               ","37":"\n                  Conventional planet formation theory suggests that chondritic materials have delivered crucial atmospheric and hydrospheric elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and hydrogen (H) onto primitive Earth.

Here we present a volatile evolution model during the assembly of Earth and Earth-like planets. Our model includes impact losses, atmosphere-mantle exchange, and time dependent effects of accretion and outgassing calculated from dynamical modeling outcomes. Exploring a wide range of planetesimal properties (i.e., size and composition) as well as impact history informed by N-body accretion simulations, we find that while the degree of CNH fractionation has inherent stochasticity, the evolution of C\/N and C\/H ratios can be traced back to certain properties of the protoplanet and projectiles. Interestingly, the majority of our Earth-like planets acquire superchondritic final C\/N ratios, implying that the volatile elemental ratios on terrestrial planets are driven by the complex interplay between delivery, atmospheric ablation, and mantle degassing.\n               ","38":"\n                  The Saglek-Hebron Complex in Northern Labrador, Canada, hosts some of the oldest rocks on Earth.

The source involved in the formation of the Saglek-Hebron Eoarchean felsic crust appears to be younger and more depleted compared to that of the Saglek-Hebron mafic-ultramafic rocks, but similar to the source of the Eoarchean granitoids from the Itsaq gneiss complex in SW Greenland. This may suggest the formation of a Hadean highly depleted mantle reservoir at the scale of the North Atlantic Craton, perhaps resulting from the extraction of Hadean mafic crust.

Burial of BC in the ocean sequesters atmospheric CO2 into a long-term carbon sink, likely exerting a positive influence on mitigating global warming. However, the abundances, sources, and burial of sedimentary BC in marine sediments remain poorly constrained, hindering us from accurately understanding the mobilization and sequestration of BC and its roles in the ocean carbon cycle. Here, we investigate concentrations and isotopes (13C and 14C) of BC among grain size-fractionated surface sediments along a across-shelf transect from the Yangtze River prodelta to the Okinawa Trough to decipher the fate of BC in the East China Sea (ECS). Our results show that the bulk BC concentrations decrease firstly from the Yangtze River prodelta to the outer shelf and then increase to the Okinawa Trough. Grain size-fractionated BC concentrations vary along the transect, which we mainly attribute to the differential mobilization of BC driven by hydrodynamic processes. We argue that BC is aged during the mobilization, which results in an older 14C ages of BC found seaward. After considering biomass- and fossil-derived BC apportionments based on 14C balance calculation, we think that BC aging may be verified by more fossil-derived BC burial in the Okinawa Trough. We estimate that BC may account for \u223c15% of sedimentary organic carbon (SOC), and up to \u223c30% of terrestrial SOC buried in the ECS. BC burial fluxes decrease along the transect, and are heterogeneous in different size fractions, indicating differential sequestration of BC in the shelf and trough. We further estimate that 685 Gg\/yr of BC is sequestered in the ECS, and 491 Gg\/yr in the prodelta area, with \u223c30% being continental biomass-derived BC. We suggest that increasing biomass-derived BC production on land and burying it in the ocean may serve as a powerful means for sequestrating atmospheric CO2, potentially contributing to carbon neutrality.\n               ","40":"\n                  This study reports results from thermodynamic phase equilibrium and trace element modelling of mafic magmatic underplating and solid-liquid interaction in the lower continental crust (LCC) in intraplate settings. The arrival of underplating basalt sills into thin (\u223c30 km at 8 kbar) and thicker (\u223c45 km at 12 kbar) andesitic and basaltic LCC precursors was simulated with heating and batch-melting to yield refractory residues. Continued magmatic invasion of the LCC was then modelled at the same pressures with hybridisation between the residual solids and basaltic and picritic liquids (at 80:20 and 50:50 proportions). The first finding is that hybridisation with basalt increases the stability fields of 2-pyroxene-plagioclase and garnet-clinopyroxene-plagioclase granulites, by far the dominant LCC xenoliths found in anorogenic settings. The second finding pertains to situations when the liquid proportion of the hybrid system is lower than the fraction of the incoming mafic liquid. The resulting liquids share many characteristics with silicic volcanic rocks in continental flood basalt (CFB) provinces, including low Al and high Ti-concentrations. Stoichiometric melting reactions from 80:20 residual andesite:basalt hybridisation reproduce trace element patterns of silicic eruptives with potential for decoupling of Sr-Nd-Pb isotope systematics, as found in CFB rhyolites and LCC xenoliths. Incongruent melting of hornblende and garnet (the A in AFC) from the residual solid and dominant peritectic fractional crystallisation of plagioclase (the FC in AFC) from the liquid occur. A notable feature of LCC-picrite hybridisation is that solid residues after felsic liquid extraction, when subjected to higher pressure, are buffered to olivine and quartz-free compositions. Consequently, if these high-pressure granulite residues delaminated, they would convert to the bi-mineralic high-Mg eclogites found as xenoliths in kimberlites. The modelled residues also have the Sr-enrichment and positive Eu-anomalies of eclogite xenoliths. Solid-liquid interaction in intraplate settings has been and remains a significant process in crustal growth and evolution.\n               ","41":"\n                  Numerical dynamo simulations cannot operate at the physical conditions of Earth's core, yet they often produce fields that appear morphologically similar to the present geomagnetic field. A key issue is therefore to decipher under what conditions \u201cEarth-like\u201d simulations can be achieved. Recent work has shown that a set of simulations undertaken along a specific path in parameter space smoothly approach the QG-MAC dynamics that are expected in Earth's core, whereby the leading order force balance is Quasi-Geostrophic with Magnetic, Archimedean and Coriolis forces equilibrating at first order. However, a systematic link between QG-MAC balance and morphological features of the simulated fields has yet to be established. Here we assess a suite of 67 simulations using established compliance criteria for the field morphology and scale-dependent force balances to quantify the internal dynamics. Morphological compliance with the modern geomagnetic field does not imply a single underlying force balance or vice versa; however, the majority of compliant simulations, including all those approaching a realistic value of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, are in QG-MAC balance. Simulations that simultaneously achieve excellent morphological compliance with Earth's modern field, QG-MAC balance, and high Rm, are confined to an intermediate range of dipolarity (the ratio of energy in the dipole field to the energy truncated at degree 12 at the outer boundary). Reversing simulations in this dipolarity range maintain dominant QG-MAC balance during polarity transition, though inertia makes a non-negligible contribution to the force balance.\n               ","42":"\n                  Flow in the mantle's bottom boundary layer plays an important role in shaping structures and processes in the deep mantle; however, knowledge of lowermost mantle flow patterns remains elusive. In particular, the influence of remnant slabs on lowermost mantle flow is poorly known, although it is likely that slabs play an important role in driving flow and thus in controlling key aspects of lowermost mantle behavior. Measurements of seismic anisotropy can yield relatively direct constraints on slab-induced lowermost mantle flow; however, such observations are challenging to make. We take advantage of the excellent raypath coverage beneath the northeastern Pacific Ocean provided by the USArray deployment in North America to provide detailed sampling of a region that has a long subduction history, with remnant slabs likely impinging on the core-mantle boundary. We present observations of coherent, strong shear wave splitting of SKKS and Sdiff phases across USArray stations and show through global wavefield modeling that the splitting is due to lowermost mantle anisotropy. A stacking approach enables us to make robust estimates of lowermost mantle splitting parameters, which we model by considering realistic mineral physics scenarios. Under the assumption of simple horizontal shear deformation, our observations are consistent with generally north-south flow directions for either a post-perovskite or a bridgmanite mineralogy; ferropericlase cannot explain observations.

These collective observations have been used to propose that a stagnant-lid, or single-lid, tectonic regime operated at this time, between periods of plate tectonics in the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. In our reappraisal of the mid-Proterozoic geological record, we not only assess the viability of the single-lid hypothesis for each line of evidence, but also that of the plate tectonic alternative. We find that evidence for the single-lid hypothesis is equivocal in all cases, whereas for plate tectonics the evidence is equivocal or supporting. We therefore find no reason to abandon a plate tectonic model for the mid-Proterozoic time period. Instead, we propose that the peculiarities of this enigmatic interval can be reconciled through the combination of two processes working in tandem: secular mantle cooling and the exceptionally long tenure and incomplete breakup of Earth's first supercontinent, where both of these phenomena had a dramatic effect on lithospheric behaviour and its resulting imprint in the geological record.\n               ","44":"\n                  Adakites with continental origin have K-rich compositions distinctive from the sodic, subduction-related adakites and are generally considered as partial melting products of thickened mafic lower crust at high pressure conditions (above 1.5 GPa; >50 km depth). In order to compare the geochemical differences and to constrain their source compositions and partial melting conditions, we compiled published data for the sodic adakites related to subduction processes in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) and the potassic adakite-like rocks related to continental collision in the Lhasa Terranes (LT) of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the spatial similarity of Sr-Nd isotopes and nature of inherited zircons, the origin of the CAOB sodic adakites is best explained by fluid-fluxed melting of low-K arc basalts, while the LT potassic adakites are best explained as generated by fluid-fluxed melting of rocks similar to the voluminous high-K Linzizong mafic volcanic successions (LVS). The phase equilibria and trace-element modeling reveal that these low Mg# mafic sources would expand garnet stability to pressures as low as 7-8 kbar and fluid-fluxed melting (X(H2O) = 2-3 wt%) would significantly decrease the modal content of plagioclase, resulting in melts with \u201chigh pressure\u201d signature (e.g., high Sr\/Y and La\/Yb). This paper provides an alternative model for the origin of sodic or potassic continental adakites arguing that they originate from fluid-fluxed melting at garnet amphibolite facies at normal lower crustal pressures (10-11 kbar). Our findings highlight the importance of the source composition and fluid content in generating the \u201chigh pressure\u201d signatures of adakites, which may also explain the origin of Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorites (TTGs).\n               ","45":"\n                  The typhoon-generated microseisms, originating from the complex energy coupling and transferring among the Atmosphere-Ocean-Solid Earth spheres, can be detected remotely by seismometers as the strongest ambient seismic noise.

Here we present a comprehensive investigation of microseisms generated by typhoon Kalmaegi (September 2014) based on multiple-instrument constraints from observations including terrestrial and ocean-bottom seismic stations as well as ocean buoys. To understand the generation mechanisms, we apply an improved frequency-domain beamforming method to seismic array data leading to successful location of double-frequency (DF) microseism source regions. For comparison, we calculate the typhoon-induced ocean waves and theoretical source regions of the DF microseisms using the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere\u2013wave\u2013sediment transport modeling system with validation by ocean buoy observations. Both observations and numerical modeling results reveal two different generation mechanisms for typhoon-induced DF microseisms during the lifespan of Kalmaegi. When over the Philippine Sea, the DF microseisms were generated mainly by opposing ocean waves from two distinct storms. After Kalmaegi entered the South China Sea, the DF microseisms were generated mainly by the fast-moving typhoon with source regions just trailing behind, with the minimum frequencies determined by the typhoon translation speed. DF microseisms generated in coastal source regions were not detected by ocean bottom seismometers, suggesting that DF microseisms might not effectively propagate across the ocean-basin seafloor covered by thick sediments, owing to severe seismic attenuation and spreading losses.

The OMAT and estimated content of submicroscopic metallic iron (SMFe) in the regolith show no obvious variations between the rock-shielded and unshielded regolith during the CE-5 descent, indicating the disturbance from rocket exhaust did not affect regolith maturity. Similar results on the effects of rocket exhaust were obtained from analyzing the regolith maturity along the CE-4 rover's traverse.

Here, we use 2D numerical models to study the evolution of initially delaminated SCLM whose density is initially larger than that of the ambient mantle. Our simulations reveal that after the dense lithospheric segments sink into the hot mantle, the increasing thermal buoyancy and\/or removal of the dense components reverse their trajectory, and most of these segments eventually relaminate to the base of the above lithosphere. The time needed for the relamination process to complete is 100-300 Myr since initial delamination, with the exact value depending on the buoyancy of the SCLM and the mantle viscosity. Both delamination and relamination could generate a rapid hundred-meter to kilometer scale surface uplift. After the relamination, the subsequent cooling of the SCLM causes gradual subsidence by \u223c2 km. This model provides a novel explanation for the observed Phanerozoic vertical motion of many cratons. According to our models, the delamination-to-relamination evolution mode could occur repeatedly during the past one billion years, as could reconcile the apparent long-term intactness of cratonic crusts and the temporal variations of cratonic topography.

To investigate the cause of this earthquake and its aftershocks, we applied a Vp\/Vs model-consistency constrained double-difference (DD) seismic tomography method to the earthquake arrival time data from the dense seismic networks in Japan to image the velocity structures at the hypocenter areas. Compared to the conventional DD tomography, the new method can determine the Vp\/Vs model with high resolution and precision. The reliability of the seismic tomography results is testified by checkerboard resolution test. The velocity profiles show that the oceanic crust and uppermost part of the oceanic mantle are characterized by low Vs and high Vp\/Vs due to hydration reaction, while the lower oceanic mantle is associated with high Vs and low Vp\/Vs anomalies that are likely caused by serpentine dehydration. The mainshock of the Mw 7.1 earthquake sequence is located at the boundary between the low velocity layer and underlying high velocity zone. The aftershocks are mainly distributed within the low velocity layer. The rupture plane inferred from the aftershock distribution and mainshock focal mechanism solution has penetrated \u223c10 km into the slab and extended \u223c50 km along a direction nearly parallel to the trench. These observations have suggested that the Mw 7.1 earthquake sequence occurs as a result of reactivation of a pre-existing fault likely created at the outer-rise before subduction. The association of the mainshock with the velocity anomaly edge suggests that this earthquake sequence is probably caused by dehydration of the mantle serpentines, which increases the pore pressure on the fault. Besides, the variation of rock mechanics at the hypocenter area of the mainshock also facilitates the nucleation of the whole earthquake sequence.\n               ","50":"\n                  The later stages of Earth's transition to a permanently oxygenated atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE; \u223c2.43\u20132.06 Ga) is commonly linked with the suggestion of an \u201coxygen overshoot\u201d during the \u223c2.22\u20132.06 Ga Lomagundi Event (LE), which represents Earth's most pronounced and longest-lived positive carbon isotope excursion. However, the magnitude and extent of atmosphere-ocean oxygenation and implications for the biosphere during this critical period in Earth's history remain poorly constrained. Here, we present nitrogen (N), selenium (Se), and carbon (C) isotope data, as well as bio-essential element concentrations, for Paleoproterozoic marine shales deposited during the LE. The data provide evidence for a highly productive and well-oxygenated photic zone, with both inner and outer-shelf marine environments characterized by nitrate- and Se oxyanion-replete conditions. However, the redoxcline subsequently encroached back onto the inner shelf during global-scale deoxygenation of the atmosphere-ocean system at the end of the LE, leading to locally enhanced water column denitrification and quantitative reduction of selenium oxyanions. We propose that nitrate-replete conditions associated with fully oxygenated continental shelf settings were a common feature during the LE, but nitrification was not sufficiently widespread for the aerobic nitrogen cycle to impact the isotopic composition of the global ocean N inventory. Placed in the context of Earth's broader oxygenation history, our findings indicate that O2 levels in the atmosphere-ocean system were likely much lower than modern concentrations. Early Paleoproterozoic biogeochemical cycles were thus far less advanced than after Neoproterozoic oxygenation.\n               ","51":"\n                  Direct inorganic silica precipitation was a major silicon sink in the Paleoproterozoic oceans, whereas the diagenetic silica replacement of peritidal carbonate rocks became an increasingly important sink for silica in Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. The unique widespread bedded chert documenting transition from platform margin to basinal environments in the Yangtze Block, South China, during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition (ECT, 550-521 Ma), however, remains enigmatic. Here, we report consistently low Germanium\/Silicon (Ge\/Si) ratios (0.2-0.5 \u03bcmol\/mol) of the ECT Liuchapo cherts. The low (Ge\/Si) ratios, combined with rare earth elements (REE) analysis, point to normal seawater source for the Liuchapo cherts. The primary nature of the chert was verified by Oxygen isotopes (\n                        \n                           \n                              \u03b4\n                           \n                           \n                              18\n                           \n                        \n                     O) of silica and thus the measured Ge\/Si ratios of the cherts could represent the maximum estimate of seawater Ge\/Si ratios during ECT. Seawater during ECT has a significantly lower Ge\/Si ratio than that of the modern marine. Low Ge\/Si requires a high fraction of seawater germanium to be buried by a non-SiO2 sink. We speculate that germanium removal may be associated with a very active iron cycle driven by oscillating redox during ECT. The iron redox cycle may also effectively shuttle seawater silicon to sediments, causing bedded cherts precipitation. This study suggests that silica precipitation may be directly linked to the redox cycling of iron, and that this linkage favors silica precipitation regardless of its saturation state in the ocean.\n               ","52":"\n                  Archaean supracrustal rocks carry a record of mass-independently fractionated S that is interpreted to be derived from UV-induced photochemical reactions in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.

In this study, we analyze and characterize a slow slip event that occurred in the Eastern Sea of Marmara in 2016. To characterize the temporal history and the location of this event, we combine for the first time in this region different types of geodetic data (strainmeters and GNSS stations) and seismicity. We propose two interpretations to explain the observations: either the slow event initiated on the western part of the Armutlu fault and then propagated approximately 40 km eastward, or it initiated on the western section of the Armutlu fault, and then jumped onto a perpendicular fault after propagating ca. 15 km. We deduce these interpretations from forward modeling of the strain and displacement data.

The alluvial-to-fluvial Lujiatun and lacustrine Jianshangou beds of the lower Yixian Formation yield exceptionally well-preserved three-dimensional and articulated dinosaur and mammal fossils, and two-dimensional primitive birds\/feathered dinosaurs, respectively. Published 40Ar\/39Ar ages for the two fossil beds have uncertainties of \u00b1 0.4 to 1.0 Ma (\u00b1 2\u03c3 analytical uncertainty), and these reflect the measurement of large, and potentially heterogeneous, populations of feldspar crystals. More precise constraints on the timing and duration of biological radiation recorded by this sequence can further quantify evolutionary patterns and rates of diversification of important Early Cretaceous animals and plants. Single crystal 40Ar\/39Ar fusion experiments on sanidine from intercalated ash beds yield dates that constrain the deposition of the Jianshangou and Lujiatun fossil beds to between 125.374 \u00b1 0.085 and 125.572 \u00b1 0.120 Ma, and 125.541 \u00b1 0.099 and 125.793 \u00b1 0.127 Ma, respectively. These ages indicate that the lower part of Jianshangou fossil bed was deposited nearly contemporaneously with the Lujiatun fossil bed. Thus, mass mortality events reflected by dinosaur fossil concentrations in the Lujiatun fossil bed and feathered dinosaur\/primitive bird fossils in the Jianshangou fossil bed were nearly coeval and short-lived. These 40Ar\/39Ar ages, combined with astrochronologic and paleomagnetic results from the lacustrine sediments in the Jianshangou fossil bed, not only refine the duration and rapid radiation of primitive birds and feathered dinosaurs in the deposit, but also suggest that the distribution of magnetic polarity chron boundaries within the Barremian stage in the current geologic time scale (GTS 2020) requires a revision.\n               ","55":"\n                  The Serpukhovian (mid-Carboniferous) mass extinction has been ranked fifth among the major Phanerozoic biodiversity crises, based on its ecological impact.

Our results shed fresh insights into recent debates on the role of H2O2 in the formation of these secondary minerals in the modern Earth, geological past, and other planets. The isotope effect experimentally quantified in this study are needed for future improvements of planetary atmosphere and solar nebular evolution models. We highlight the importance of further experimental and theoretical efforts to quantify isotope effects in H2O2 chemistry that are representative of natural systems.\n               ","57":"\n                  Marine ironstone is a Phanerozoic biochemical sedimentary rock that contains abundant primary iron. Although rare, ironstone is conspicuous in the Paleozoic sedimentary record. Its iron source remains contentious, with traditional models invoking a continentally derived source. Increasing sedimentologic evidence suggests that many Paleozoic ironstones formed along favourably oriented continental margins where coastal upwelling delivered ferruginous waters, with the postulated source of iron being deep-ocean hydrothermal fluids. Thus, deep-water redox conditions are potentially a critical control on the concentration of iron in early Phanerozoic seawater and the accumulation of ironstone. We report novel in situ strontium isotopic and europium anomaly data from five geographically and temporally distinct Ordovician-Silurian ironstones from the Rheic and Iapetus oceans to test the emerging ferruginous upwelling model. These data provide robust evidence that ironstone formed from marine fluids with a component of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal waters that remained largely unmixed during transport to the locations of ironstone accumulation. These results imply that the deep oceans must have been oxygen deficient to allow local or regional enrichment in hydrothermal iron. Such conditions are interpreted to have been associated with a spatiotemporally variable redox-stratified global ocean with anoxia beneath an oxic surface layer. Thus, sedimentologic and geochemical data presented herein agree with other paleoredox proxies that suggest rising oxygen levels in the Neoproterozoic gave way to early Paleozoic oceans with dynamic redox conditions. The temporal record of Paleozoic ironstone suggests redox stratification, poor deep-ocean ventilation, and upwelling-related ironstone genesis persisted until the Devonian but not into the Carboniferous.\n               ","58":"\n                  The striking coincidence of the Franklin large igneous province (LIP) and the Sturtian glaciation onset ca. 717 million years ago (Ma) has inspired the hypothesis that either basaltic weathering or stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection of the Franklin LIP plunged Earth into global glaciation. The cool background climate just before the Sturtian has been commonly invoked by such initiation models. Difficulty in definitively linking these concepts with geological evidence has precluded complete demonstration of a snowball trigger mechanism. Here, we report that Franklin-aged magmatism was not only present in Laurentia and Siberia, but also in South China, where the Hubei\u2013Shaanxi Magmatic Province formed at 720 Ma, revealing widespread magmatic provinces immediately preceding the onset of the Sturtian snowball Earth. Geochronological and geochemical data suggest that the geographically widespread magmatic provinces were emplaced over a short duration (ca. 720\u2013717 Ma) and likely related to a mantle superplume beneath supercontinent Rodinia. We propose that low-to-mid-latitude volcanism prior to the Sturtian by a few million years enhanced global weatherability and created the background cool climate for the superimposed shock of stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection of the terminal Franklin eruption. Such widespread 720\u2013717 Ma volcanism on different continents may have driven the Sturtian snowball initiation.\n               ","59":"\n                  Layered intrusions are fossilized mafic magma chambers in the Earth's crust. The pathways that led to crystallization and solidification of layered intrusions have been hotly debated as the growth model of primocrysts (the earliest-formed crystals) in mafic magma chambers remains enigmatic. In this study, we carried out high-resolution elemental mapping of mm-scale olivine primocrysts from the Sept Iles layered intrusion (Canada), the third largest one in the world, with a focus on phosphorus (P) zoning of olivine. Our results reveal that complex P zoning of olivine with intense dissolution textures is ubiquitous in the \u223c4.7 km-thick Layered Series of the intrusion. The P-rich zones of olivine are featured with dendritic, hopper and sector-zoned patterns, which are attributed to significant magma undercooling. Thermal modeling based on a 1-D conductive cooling model suggests that initially hot parental magma intruding into cold country rocks would result in high degrees of undercooling (-\u0394T >60 \u00b0C) in the margins (i.e., floor, roof and sidewalls) of magma chamber, facilitating rapid growth of dendritic olivine, which may be then spread within the magma chamber by dynamic convection and crucial to construct initial crystal framework of a solidifying magma chamber. Additionally, diffusion modeling based on the P gradients in olivine suggests a minimum cooling rate of 2.7 to 3.3\u00d710\u22123 \u00b0C\/year in the center of the intrusion, similar to the averaged cooling rate of other layered intrusions (e.g., Bushveld, Stillwater and Skaergaard) reported in previous studies. This indicates that rapid cooling (ca. 10\u22122 to 10\u22123 \u00b0C\/year) at high temperature (>800 \u00b0C) may be predominant regardless of the size of magma chambers. Our study demonstrates that P zoning of olivine is powerful in decoding crystallization and thermal histories of mafic-ultramafic intrusions.\n               ","60":"\n                  The coseismic slip during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake has been revealed to reach the Japan trench axis, but the detailed slip behaviors in different zones along the trench remain an unsolved problem. To investigate the along-trench structures that directly affect the coseismic activities, we collected densely distributed seismic reflection data south of the major coseismic slip zone in the region of 36\u201337.5\u00b0N. Our seismic data document numerous local structural variations along different segments of the study zone: varying thicknesses of incoming sediments; chaotic structures in the north and fold-and-thrust belts in the south at the wedge front; different morphologies of the subducting plate, correlating with the physical properties above the plate interface and influencing, in turn, shallow megathrust slip and tsunami genesis. The southern limit of the 2011 event large coseismic rupture zone at \u223c37\u00b0N works as a transition zone, which appears to correlate with the landward extension of a subducting channel in the deep places, and the shallower detachment fault structures in the graben beneath the trench axis that are less developed than those in the large slip zone further north. It also appears to correlate with the different elastic properties along the basal layer of the overriding plate caused by regionally various thickness and lithologies.\n               ","61":"\n                  Water is an essential ingredient in transforming primitive mantle-derived (mafic) rocks into buoyant (felsic) continental crust, thereby driving the irreversible differentiation of Earth's lithosphere. The occurrence in Archaean cratons of sodic granites of the tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite (TTG) series, high-MgO variolitic basalts, high-Mg diorites (sanukitoids) and diamonds with harzburgitic inclusion assemblages, all require the presence of hydrous fluids in Earth's deep crust and upper (lithospheric) mantle since at least the Paleoarchaean (3.6\u20133.2 billion years ago). However, despite its importance, where and how water was stored in Archaean crust, and how some water was transported into the upper mantle, are poorly understood. Here, we investigate Archaean crustal fluid budgets through calculated phase equilibria for three protolith compositions \u2014 a low-MgO mafic (basaltic) composition, a high-MgO (picritic) composition and an ultrahigh-MgO ultramafic (komatiitic) composition \u2014 that are representative of mafic to ultramafic magmatic rocks in Archaean greenstone belts. We show that the mode and stability of hydrous minerals, in particular chlorite, is positively correlated with protolith MgO content, such that high-MgO basalts can store up to twice the amount of crystal-bound H2O than low-MgO basalts. Importantly, ultrahigh-MgO rocks such as komatiite can store four times as much H2O, most of which is retained until temperatures exceeding 700\u00b0C. Warmer geotherms in the early Archaean favoured dehydration of hydrated high-MgO and ultramafic rocks in the deep crust, leading to hydration and\/or fluid-fluxed melting of overlying basaltic rocks to produce \u2018high-pressure\u2019 TTG magmas. Burial of Archaean mafic\u2013ultramafic crust along cooler geotherms resulted in dehydration of ultramafic material within the lithospheric mantle, providing the source of enriched Archaean basalt that was parental to large volumes of ancient TTG-dominated continental crust.\n               ","62":"\n                  We report detailed field measurements of the 2021, Mw7.4 Maduo earthquake surface rupture south of the Kunlun fault, near the northern boundary of Tibet's Bayan Har block. In the field, the dominantly left-lateral surface rupture length was \u223c151 km, along the poorly known Jiangcuo fault, with maximum horizontal and vertical displacements of \u223c2.1\u00b10.2 to 2.9\u00b10.2 m (up to 3.6\u00b10.2 m at one site) and \u223c1.2\u00b10.2 to 1.8\u00b10.2 m, respectively. The rupture, which propagated bilaterally from a roughly central epicenter, terminated in well-defined, \u223c20 km-long horsetail splays, as predicted by Coulomb stress failure, consistent with the very young age of the still growing Jiangcuo fault, which may be trying to bypass the Anyemaqen restraining bend in order to connect directly the Kokoxili and Maqen segments of the main Kunlun fault. 14C dating at one site (Cuoerjiala) implies long return times (\u22656500 years) for M7+, Maduo-type earthquakes, in keeping with a slow horizontal slip rate of \u223c0.55\u00b10.03 mm\/yr and the subdued geomorphic expression of the fault. In the broader Tibetan tectonics framework, the Jiangcuo fault may be better interpreted as a kinematic streamlining of the Kunlun fault bend, rather than a result of diffuse deformation across the Bayan Har terrane.\n               ","63":"\n                  Magnetotelluric (MT) imaging results from mineral provinces in Australia and in the United States show an apparent spatial relationship between crustal-scale electrical conductivity anomalies and major magmatic-hydrothermal iron oxide-apatite\/iron oxide-copper-gold (IOA-IOCG) deposits. Although these observations have driven substantial interest in the use of MT data to image ancient fluid pathways, the exact cause of these anomalies has been unclear. Here, we interpret the conductors to be the result of graphite precipitation from CO2-rich magmatic fluids during cooling. These fluids would have exsolved from mafic magmas at mid- to lower-crustal depths; saline magmatic fluids that could drive mineralization were likely derived from related, more evolved intrusions at shallower crustal levels. In our model, the conductivity anomalies then mark zones that once were the deep roots of ancient magmatic-hydrothermal mineral systems.\n               ","64":"\n                  In lakes and oceans, links between modern sediment density flow processes and deposits preserved in long-term geological records are poorly understood. Consequently, it is unclear whether, and if so how, long-term climate changes affect the magnitude\/frequency of sediment density flows. One approach to answering this question is to analyze a comprehensive geological record that comprises deposits that can be reliably linked to modern sediment flow processes. To address this question, we investigated the unique ICDP Core 5017-1 from the Dead Sea (the largest and deepest hypersaline lake on the Earth) depocenter covering MIS 7-1. Based on an understanding of modern sediment density flow processes in the lake, we link homogeneous muds in the core to overflows (surface flood plumes, \u03c1\n                     flow<\u03c1\n                     water), and link graded turbidites and debrites to underflows (\u03c1\n                     flow>\u03c1\n                     water).

We conducted SPH simulations that closely reproduced the impact experiments.\n                  Our results suggest that cratering on heterogeneous targets displaces and ejects boulders, rather than fragmenting them, unless directly hit. We also see indications that as long as the energy required to disrupt the boulder is small compared to the kinetic energy of the impact, the disruption of boulders directly hit by the projectile may have minimal effect on the crater size.\n                  The presence of boulders within the target causes ejecta curtains with higher ejection angles compared to homogeneous targets. At the same time, there is a segregation of the fine ejecta from the boulders, resulting in boulders landing at larger distances than the surrounding fine grained material. However, boulders located in the target near the maximum extent of the expanding excavation cavity are merely exhumed and distributed radially around the crater rim, forming ring patterns similar to the ones observed on asteroids Itokawa, Ryugu and Bennu. Altogether, on rubble-pile asteroids this process will redistribute boulders and finer-grained material heterogeneously, both areally around the crater and vertically in the regolith. In the context of a kinetic impactor on a rubble-pile asteroid and the DART mission, our results indicate that the presence of boulders will reduce the momentum transfer compared to a homogeneous, fine-grained target.\n               ","67":"\n                  Icelandic basalts have low oxygen isotope (\n                        \n                           \n                              \u03b4\n                           \n                           \n                              18\n                           \n                        \n                     O) values compared to other ocean island localities.

Here we report Ba isotope compositions for granites from the Jurassic Qitianling batholith in the Nanling Range, South China that hosts several large tin deposits.

Such unbalance between supplied (input) and erupted (output) magma rates is thought to result from steady, degassing-driven, convective magma overturning in a shallow conduit\/feeding dyke. Here, we characterize shallow magma circulation at Stromboli volcano by combining independent observations of heat (Volcanic Radiative Power; via satellite images) and gas (SO2, via UV camera) output in a temporal interval (from August 1, 2018 to April 30, 2020) encompassing the summer 2019 effusive eruption and two paroxysmal explosions (on July 3 and August 28, 2019). We show that, during the phase of ordinary strombolian explosive activity that preceded the 2019 effusive eruption, the average magma input rate (0.1-0.2 m3\/s) exceeds the magma eruption rate (0.001-0.01 m3\/s) by \u223c2 orders of magnitude. Conversely, magma input and output rates converge to an average of \u223c0.4 m3\/s during the summer 2019 summit effusion, implying an overall suppression of magma recycling back into the feeding system, and hence of excess degassing. We find that, during the effusive eruption, the peak in SO2 emissions lags behind the thermal emission peak by \u223c27 days, suggesting that magma output, feeding the lava flow field, initially dominates over magma input in the conduit. We propose that this conduit mass unloading, produced by this initial phase of the effusive eruption, leads to an overall decompression (of up to 30 Pa\/s) of the shallow plumbing system, ultimately causing ascent of less-dense, volatile-rich magma batch(es) from depth, enhanced explosive activity, and elevated SO2 fluxes culminating into a paroxysmal explosion on August 28. Our results demonstrate that combined analysis of thermal and SO2 flux time-series paves the way to improved understanding of shallow magmatic system dynamics at open-vent volcanoes, and of the transition from explosive to effusive activity regimes.\n               ","70":"\n                  Chemical analyses of 2,618 (1,640 new and 978 published) fluid inclusions in marine halite were used to define paleoseawater [Ca2+] and [SO\n                        \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                              2\n                              \u2212\n                           \n                           \n                           \n                              4\n                           \n                           \n                        \n                     ] over the past 550 million years (Myr).

This study presents new simulations of pCO2 and surface temperatures using a spatially resolved climate-carbon cycle Earth system model fed with refined continental reconstructions and new estimates of solid Earth degassing. First, in order to quantify the respective roles of paleogeography and degassing, the impact of continental drift alone is investigated. This is done by calculating its imprint on continental weathering rates throughout the Ordovician under a constant pCO2, and by testing different topography inputs. Secondly, the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to paleogeography and carbon degassing changes is investigated by coupling the climate and carbon cycles in the GEOCLIM model. Based on our experiments we show that, although Early Ordovician high temperatures can be replicated within error margins, our new constraints cannot explain the intense cooling over the Mid to Late Ordovician, even if a progressive enhancement in Earth surface weatherability is taken into account. By using GEOCLIM in an inverse modelling approach, we calculate that the theoretical degassing necessary to reach proxy-derived temperatures for the Early Ordovician is three-to-five times higher compared to modern values. Further, in order to simulate the following Ordovician cooling trend, the solid Earth degassing must be reduced to modern-day values in only 30 Myrs. We conclude that, if accepting the veracity of the high Early Ordovician temperatures, alternative sources but also sinks of carbon must be considered to explain the climatic shift over the period.\n               ","72":"\n                  Ordovician-Silurian transition (OST) sections of South China contain extremely high mercury (Hg) concentrations (>1000 ppb) of uncertain provenance.

The rock sample, analyzed by the X-ray diffractometer onboard the Curiosity rover, also contained feldspar, cristobalite, and opaline silica (\u00b1Si-glass). Monoclinic tridymite is extremely rare on Earth, and has only been discovered in silicic volcanic environments, high-temperature impact settings, and extraterrestrial rocks. We review the most common formation pathways of natural tridymite and run thermodynamical models to investigate possible formation mechanisms. We consider the broader context of the sample to propose a formation and transport mechanism based on: (1) the mineralogical assemblage of the mudstone and rocks in the vicinity, (2) the composition of the mudstone layer, and (3) the overall geological context. Based on the large amount of tridymite, the high SiO2 and low Al2O3 concentration of the mudstone, and the low temperature context within distal lacustrine mudstone, we propose that an explosive eruption released Si-rich ashes, which were deposited into Gale crater's watershed as a tridymite-rich ashfall along with cristobalite, feldspar, Ti-oxide, and Si-rich glass, when Gale was still a lake (Hesperian). The dissolution of Si-rich glass and mineral sorting during transport would have concentrated tridymite, caused opaline silica precipitation, and relatively lowered the Al2O3 concentration. This scenario implies that explosive volcanism on Mars occurred during the Hesperian and might not be restricted to basaltic eruptions, revealing the complexity of Mars magmatism.\n               ","74":"\n                  In this study we use the Groningen gas field to test a new method to assess stress changes due to gas extraction and forecast induced seismicity. We take advantage of the detailed knowledge of the reservoir geometry and production history, and of the availability of surface subsidence measurements and high quality seismicity data. The subsurface is represented as a homogeneous isotropic linear poroelastic half-space subject to stress changes in three-dimensional space due to reservoir compaction and pore pressure variations. The reservoir is represented with cuboidal strain volumes. Stress changes within and outside the reservoir are calculated using a convolution with semi-analytical Green functions. The uniaxial compressibility of the reservoir is spatially variable and constrained with surface subsidence data. We calculate stress changes since the onset of gas production. Coulomb stress changes are maximum near the top and bottom of the reservoir where the reservoir is offset by faults. To assess earthquake probability, we use the standard Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion assuming instantaneous nucleation and a non-critical initial stress. The distribution of initial strength excess, the difference between the initial Coulomb stress and the critical Coulomb stress at failure, is treated as a stochastic variable and estimated from the observations and the modelled stress changes. The exponential rise of seismicity nearly 30 years after the onset of production, provides constraints on the distribution of initial strength. The lag and exponential onset of seismicity are well reproduced assuming either a generalized Pareto distribution, which can represent the tail of any distribution, or a Gaussian distribution, to describe both the tail and body of the distribution. The Gaussian distribution allows to test if the induced seismicity at Groningen has transitioned to the steady-state where seismicity rate is proportional to the stressing rate. We find no evidence that the system has reached such a steady-state regime. The modeling framework is computationally efficient making it possible to test the sensitivity to modeling assumptions regarding the estimation of stress changes. The forecast is found robust to uncertainties about the ability of the model to represent accurately the physical processes. It does not require in particular a priori knowledge of the location and orientation of the faults that can be activated. The method presented here is in principle applicable to induced seismicity in any setting provided deformation and seismicity data are available to calibrate the model.\n               ","75":"\n                  In this paper, sea-level fluctuations during the Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE) are investigated.

New stable isotope data, zircon U-Pb geochronology, carbonate petrology, conodont and foraminifer biostratigraphy from the Carnian of the Sichuan Basin and comparison to the well-dated coeval successions of the Dolomites allow pinpointing with unprecedented precision this sea-level fall and determine that it occurred after the onset of the first, but prior to the third negative \n                        \n                           \n                              \u03b4\n                           \n                           \n                              13\n                           \n                        \n                     C shift of the CPE.

Facies analysis and sequence stratigraphy of units deposited during the ensuing sea-level rise in the Sichuan and Dolomites, further show that a Tethys-wide crisis of microbial carbonate production and drowning of carbonate platforms were followed by a recovery of marine calcification, widely testified by the deposition of oolitic bodies. Whereas a Tethys-wide recovery of microbial carbonate production is documented at the end of the Carnian, this increase in chemical calcification occurred earlier, at the beginning of the Tuvalian, and suggest that global transformations in carbonate systems coincident with the CPE were complex and share commonalities with other times in the geological record when a similar evolution was linked to ocean acidification.\n               ","76":"\n                  Cerberus Fossae is a long and narrow graben system located approximately 1000 km southeast of Elysium Mons, Mars. These structures have long been thought to be dike-induced, and are the focus of renewed attention due to the detection of seismic activity in this area by InSight. Here we report that structural modeling and linear elastic fracture mechanics provide strong evidence that the Cerberus Fossae grabens are dike-related structures, and that their intrusion may have released significant amounts of seismic energy. The modeled dike apertures are between \u223c175 and 750 m, and their aspect ratios are consistent with fluid-induced fractures formed in a weakened host rock. We observe densely fractured terrains in high-resolution images of the graben walls, confirming the presence of a weakened crust underneath Cerberus. We used dike geometry and plausible mechanical properties to calculate the source moment released by dike opening and inflation in two scenarios; using the present-day dike dimensions (Md) and in dikes with downscaled sizes to represent smaller intrusions (md). These yielded values between 2.7\u22c51016 and 1.3 1021 Nm. From these we estimate that the Cerberus diking events may have expressed seismically through a marsquake series with cumulative moment magnitudes (Mw) between 4.6 and 7.8. InSight has so far detected seismic events with Mw magnitudes as low as 1. Therefore, these results suggest that if the emplacement of even smaller dikes than those inferred below Cerberus is currently taking place, intrusion-induced seismicity could be detected by InSight.\n               ","77":"\n                  Subduction of oceanic lithosphere transports surface H2O into the mantle. Recent studies show that dense SiO2 in the form of stishovite, an abundant mineral in subducted oceanic crust at depths greater than \u223c270 km, has the potential to host and transport a considerable amount of H2O into the lower mantle, but the H2O storage capacity of SiO2 phases at high pressure and temperature remains uncertain. We investigate the hydration of stishovite and its higher-pressure polymorphs, \u03b2-stishovite and seifertite, with in situ X-ray diffraction experiments at high pressures and temperatures. The H2O contents in SiO2 phases are quantified based on observed increases in unit cell volume relative to the anhydrous SiO2 system. Density functional theory (DFT) computations permit calibration of water content as a function of volume change based on interstitial substitution of H2O. Regression of our experimental data indicates an H2O storage capacity in stishovite of \u223c3.5 wt% in the transition zone and shallow lower mantle, decreasing to about 0.8 wt% at the base of the mantle. We find that SiO2-bearing subducted oceanic crust can accommodate all the H2O in slab lithosphere that survives sub-arc dehydration. Hydration of silica phases in subducted oceanic crust and their unparalleled capacity to host significant amounts of H2O even at high mantle temperatures provides a unique mechanism for transport and storage of water in the deepest mantle.\n               ","78":"\n                  Earthquake precursory phenomena like foreshocks are common but the physical processes which produce them and lead to rupture are poorly understood.

Their presence is evidenced by synchronizations of deep and shallow seismic activities in the slab. Probabilities that these synchronizations could be due to chance are infinitesimal (<10\u22125). We show that a significant part of the activity in this subduction occurs during these bursts and that they are responsible for the foreshock sequence which preceded the earthquake. These observations support the existence of fluid channels connecting the deep slab, where water is released during dehydration, to the shallow seismogenic zone.\n               ","79":"\n                  The 2021 Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in the Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland, was followed by effusive lava outflow lasting six months.

Additionally, we relocated the preceding earthquake swarms of 2017, 2019 and 2020 and found that they form two branches along the oblique plate boundary, which coincide with the WSW-ENE trending cluster of the 2021 swarm. These branches form a stepover of \u223c1 km offset, forming a pull-apart basin structure at the intersection with the dyke. This is the place where the eruption occurred, suggesting that magma erupted at the place of crustal weakening.\n                  The strong seismic activity started with a ML 5.3 earthquake of 24 February 2021, which triggered the aftershocks on the oblique plate boundary and in the area of magmatic dyke, both in an area of elevated Coulomb stress. The seismicity shows a complex propagation of the dyke, which started at its northern end, migrated southwestward and then jumped back to the central part where the effusive eruption took place. The observed N-S striking focal mechanisms are interpreted as right-lateral antithetic Riedel shears that accommodate the left lateral slip along the oblique plate boundary. The co-existence of seismic and magmatic activity suggests that the past seismic activity weakened the crust in the eruption site area, where magma accumulated. The following ML 5.3 earthquake of 24 February 2021 triggered the seismic swarm and likely perturbed the magma pocket which led to the six-months lasting eruption that started on 19 March.\n               ","80":"\n                  In an active thrust-fold belt, the drainage evolution, such as the alternation between transverse and longitudinal rivers, will influence the surface erosion within the range and the sedimentary sequence in the foreland basin. However, knowledge of the controls of changes in transverse or longitudinal drainage patterns in an uplifting range is limited. The Yumu Shan, on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, is an example for a young and active thrust-fold range that shows evidence for drainage reversals since \u223c3 Ma. The materials we used are the late Cenozoic depositional sequences around the Yumu Shan. Analyses of the lithology, grain size, roundness, and clast orientation of gravel deposits on the northern and southern flanks, combined with the results of cosmogenic nuclide burial dating, reveal that a transverse river, the Liyuan River, crossed the Yumu Shan range during 3.0\u20131.8 Ma by eroding weak Cenozoic sedimentary rocks. After 1.8 Ma, however, this transverse river was deflected and flowed along the edge of the range, and a longitudinal river developed along the back flank of the range. This process was synchronous with the exposure of resistant Paleozoic rocks by the continuous uplift of the range. After comparison with other potential controlling factors for drainage reversals, such as variations in rock uplift, climate or upstream aggradation, we find that the change in bedrock resistance was the most likely control on the change from a transverse to a longitudinal drainage pattern in this relatively young thrust-fold belt. Furthermore, through comparison with a series of active fold-thrust belts worldwide, we propose a simple conceptual model for the drainage evolution of active fold-thrust belts. In the earlier stage of the uplift, the exposed soft sedimentary rocks will cause transverse (antecedent) rivers to cross the range. After the continuous uplift of the range, resistant rocks cause the deflection of a transverse river and its change to a longitudinal river along the back flank of the range. In the final stage, after the several million years to around ten million years of uplift, with the development of a mature range, the local base level of the foreland will greatly fall, promoting a return to a transverse drainage pattern by headward erosion and capture of longitudinal rivers.\n               ","81":"\n                  Subducted oceanic serpentinite carries H2O, ferric iron, carbon and sulfur into the subduction zone, where they are stepwise released during dehydration. These C-O-H-S fluids are intimately linked to magma oxidation and ore formation within magmatic arcs. However, the mechanism of transfer of carbon, sulfur and ferric iron into fluids is poorly known. It is also controversial whether the C-O-H-S fluids can oxidize arc magmas. We present new thermodynamic models for serpentinite to predict the species produced in C-O-H-S fluids during subduction. Closed system modeling provides molar concentrations of species at different P-T conditions, and shows that reducing species generally have high solubilities at low P-T conditions. Oxidizing species mainly partition into the fluid at higher P-T conditions. The concentration of iron in fluids is much lower than that of other major elements. Open-system fluid fractionation shows that only 5-14% of the carbon is lost to the mantle wedge, while the loss of sulfur is as high as 55-100% at sub-arc depths. Almost all carbon and sulfur lost are released as oxidizing species. The redox properties of the fluids are controlled by sulfur, resulting in an oxygen fugacity of the fluids that is 0.6-0.95 log units higher than the HM buffer. Sulfur loss is a function of the whole-rock composition (e.g., Mg\/Si, Al, Ca, and especially Fe3+\/Fetot ratio) and the geothermal gradient of the subduction zone, with elevated sulfur fluxes predicted for serpentinite in cold subduction zones. The maximum amount of sulfur released in a cold subduction regime is 5.5 times higher than in a warm subduction regime. Our modeling results are consistent with petrological observations and global-arc-basalt oxygen fugacity calculations and highlight that the C-O-H-S fluids released from the subducted slab may contribute considerably to the composition of arc magmas.\n               ","82":"\n                  Although the nature of the early Martian climate is a matter of considerable debate, the presence of valley networks (VN) provides unambiguous evidence for the presence of liquid water on Mars' surface. A subaerial fluvial origin of VN is at odds with the expected phase instability of near-surface water in the cold, dry Late Noachian climate. Furthermore, many geomorphic properties of VN (e.g., deep U-shaped valleys with constant widths; longitudinal profile reversals) are inconsistent with surface water flow. Conversely, subglacial channels exhibit many of these characteristics and could have persisted beneath ice sheets even in a cold climate. Here we model basal melting beneath a Late Noachian Icy Highlands ice sheet and map subglacial hydrological flow paths to investigate the distribution and geomorphometry of subglacial channels. We show that subglacial processes produce enough melt water to carve Mars' VN; that predicted channel distribution is consistent with observations; and corroborate reversed channel gradient measurements of VN consistent with subglacial formation mechanisms. We suggest that, given a sufficient historical global water inventory and Late Noachian geothermal heat flux, subglacial hydrology may have played a significant role in the surface modification of Mars.\n                  \n                     Plain language summary. Thousands of valley networks on Mars appear to have been carved by flowing water, and exhibit branching characteristics akin to river networks on Earth. Their origins, however, remain enigmatic for two primary reasons. First, ancient Mars was potentially cold, dry, and unable to support liquid water on its surface. Second, many physical characteristics of the valleys are inconsistent with features formed by precipitation and runoff. On Earth, water flowing beneath ice sheets produces channels with similar characteristics to Mars' valley networks. Here we model the deposition and evolution of Martian ice sheets and show that melting at the ice sheet base is likely even under cold and dry surface conditions. The volume, regional distribution, and flow patterns of melt are consistent with the volume and dynamics needed to carve the observed valley networks. A subglacial origin for Mars' valley networks accounts for their formation in a cold, dry climate and produces valley characteristics that match observations.\n               ","83":"\n                  Climate-triggered fluctuations of surface masses, including ice and water, can cause transient stress in the Earth's crust, further affecting the slip behavior of faults over different temporal and length scales.

Here, we utilize a numerical model in a case study of the Malawi (Nyasa) Rift to understand the response of faults to mass fluctuations on the Earth's surface. The water level of Lake Malawi rose 600 m over the last 150 kyr, and significantly influenced the stress state of faults in rift valley. We find that such water load fluctuations can exert 4.6 MPa normal stress on fault planes and produce a negative Coulomb stress (down to \u22122.0 MPa) on fault planes as well as a pronounced reduction of slip (\u223c2 m) on fault planes within the rift. Moreover, along-strike differences in fault geometries and their position relative to the center of the water column load resulted in variable along-strike stress and slip changes. These results suggest that lakes that develop within continental rifts play an important role in the evolution of extensional faulting.

Despite the widespread use of the two methods, there has been surprisingly little research on how well the sediment budgets produced by these two approaches reconcile with one another, which highlights the lack of quantitative understanding of errors for sediment budgets measured with remote sensing in planetary research. Therefore, there is a general need to expand our knowledge of sediment budgets. Here we use a background review and analog case study of an aeolian dunefield in Grand Canyon, Earth to frame a path forward for addressing shortcomings of remote sensing sediment budgets on Mars. We estimate a 53% percent difference in the sediment budget determined with remote sensing relative to in-situ methods for a simple endmember scenario of a dunefield within a unimodal wind directional regime and no external sediment supply. However, when we incorporated key sources of uncertainty in remote sensing change detection following methods commonly used by geomorphologists on Earth, the estimates of sediment budget differences relative to the in-situ method spanned a much larger range, from 3% to 138%. Our case study also suggests that sediment budget errors could be much larger under more complex wind direction, sediment supply, and physiographic settings, and that variability in those landscape characteristics might be used to better estimate errors for dunefield sediment budgets. We conclude that by comparing sediment budgets derived from in-situ measurements of sediment fluxes and from remote sensing measurements at many more analog sites on Earth, the aeolian research community, and the geomorphology discipline, could gain an understanding of the errors of the remote sensing method, which is used by investigators on other planetary bodies such as Mars. This could improve the ability to quantify sediment budgets on Mars \u2013 and, in the future, other planetary environments where high-resolution topographic data are available \u2013 as well as directly improve our ability to interpret extraterrestrial landscape evolution related to climate, weather, and geologic history.\n               ","87":"\n                  Mechanisms responsible for the long-term subsidence of intracontinental basins such as the Williston Basin in North America remain enigmatic, partly due to the thick sedimentary layer commonly found in the basins that prevents reliably imaging the deep crustal and upper mantle structures using some of the most-commonly employed seismic methods such as receiver function analysis. In this study, we used receiver functions recorded by 274 USArray and other stations in the Williston Basin and adjacent areas to investigate the layered structure of the crust in the hydrocarbon-rich intracontinental basin. After the removal of strong reverberations on the receiver functions associated with a low-velocity sedimentary layer using a recently developed time-domain deconvolution approach, two positive arrivals representing downward increases of seismic velocities are imaged beneath the basin and the area to the west. The top interface has a depth of about 40 km at the depocenter of the basin, and gradually shallows eastward to about 30 km beneath the Superior Craton, and the deeper interface has a mean depth of about 65 km beneath the Williston Basin. The layer between the two interfaces may represent an eclogitized or garnet-rich lower crustal layer. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that continuous retrograde metamorphic reactions in the previously-thickened lower crust during the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogeny resulted in the subsidence of the intracontinental Williston Basin.\n               ","88":"\n                  Body wave observations of the Earth's inner core show that it contains strong seismic heterogeneity, both laterally and radially. Models of inner core structure generated using body wave data are often limited by their parameterisation. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether features such as anisotropic hemispheres or an innermost inner core truly exist with their simple shapes, or result only from the chosen parameterisation and are in fact more complex features. To overcome this limitation, we conduct seismic tomography using transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo on a high quality dataset of 5296 differential and 2344 absolute P-wave travel times. In a transdimensional approach, the data defines the model space parameterisation, providing us with both the mean value of each model parameter and its probability distribution, allowing us to identify well versus poorly constrained regions. We robustly recover many first order observations found in previous studies without the imposition of a priori fixed geometry including an isotropic top layer (with anisotropy less than 1%) which is between 60 and 170 km thick, and separated into hemispheres with a slow west and a faster east. Strong anisotropy (with a maximum of 7.2%) is found mainly in the west, with much weaker anisotropy in the east. We observe for the first time that the western anisotropic zone is largely confined to the northern hemisphere, a property which would not be recognised in models assuming a simple hemispherical parameterisation. We further find that the inner most inner core, in which the slowest anisotropic velocity direction is tilted relative to Earth's axis of rotation (\n                        \u03b6\n                        =\n                        \n                           \n                              55\n                           \n                           \n                              \u2218\n                           \n                        \n                        \u00b1\n                        \n                           \n                              16\n                           \n                           \n                              \u2218\n                           \n                        \n                     ), is offset by 400 km from the centre of the inner core and is restricted to the eastern hemisphere.

A numerical model is used to investigate the prevalence of these regimes and the change in shape (of horizontal cross-section) of the dyke's solidus and mobile melt extent (MME) isotherms. For static magma, the solidus narrows from its initial shape throughout cooling while the MME initially narrows prior to widening. Magma reinjection leads to widening of the MME after each injection, with a lesser to no response in the solidus aspect ratio. For static magma, the minimum dyke width at which meltback occurs is inversely proportional to the country rock temperature (with no meltback for country rock below specific temperatures determined by the specific magma properties). Considering reinjection allows for meltback at significantly lower country rock temperatures and a power law relationship is determined between this meltback width and the reinjection period. Injection of superheated magma gives rise to further widening of the MME during cooling with no effect on the solidus shape, as well as decreasing the country rock temperature required for meltback.\n               ","90":"\n                  Aerobic oxidation of methane (MOx) is an important biologically mediated process that consumes methane in a wide range of environments.

These ghost-like particles provide a direct measure of the amount of heat producing elements (HPE: Th & U) in the Earth and in turn define the planet's absolute concentration of the refractory elements. The geoneutrino flux has contributions from the lithosphere and mantle. Detector sensitivity follows a 1\/r2 (source detector separation distance) dependence. Accordingly, an accurate geologic model of the Near-Field Lithosphere (NFL, closest 500 km) surrounding each experiment is required to define the mantle's contribution. Because of its proximity to the detector and enrichment in HPEs, the local lithosphere contributes \u223c50% of the signal and has the greatest effect on interpreting the mantle's signal.\n                  We re-analyzed the upper crustal compositional model used by Agostini et al. (2020) for the Borexino experiment. We documented the geology of the western Near-Field region as rich in potassic volcanism, including some centers within 50 km of the detector. In contrast, the Agostini study did not include these lithologies and used only a HPE-poor, carbonate-rich, model for upper crustal rocks in the surrounding \u223c150 km of the Borexino experiment. Consequently, we report 3\u00d7 higher U content for the local upper crust, which produces a 200% decrease in Earth's radiogenic heat budget, when compared to their study. Results from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments are at odds with one another and predict mantle compositional heterogeneity that is untenable. Combined analyses of the KamLAND and Borexino experiments using our revised local models strongly favor an Earth with \u223c20 TW present-day total radiogenic power. The next generation of geoneutrino detectors (SNO+, counting; and JUNO, under construction) will better constrain the HPE budget of the Earth.\n               ","92":"\n                  Relative to more mature fault zones, immature fault zones that have accumulated smaller total displacement are characterized by less efficient strain localization and more complicated earthquake ruptures. How differences in maturation are reflected in regional-scale upper-crustal fracturing is not well known. Recently, complicated earthquake ruptures associated with immature fault zones, such as the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake in New Zealand, have occurred in areas that are in regional proximity (<100 km away) to more mature faults. Here we examine whether inefficient strain localization in less mature fault zones is associated with a broader distribution and anomalously elevated concentration of fractures over distances of tens of kilometers. We use regional seismic arrival-time tomography in a broad area around the Kaik\u014dura earthquake to investigate lateral variations in Vp and Vp\/Vs. Focusing on the extensively faulted but compositionally uniform Torlesse-Pahau terrane in the Marlborough region where the earthquake occurred, we attribute lateral variations in Vp and Vp\/Vs to differences in concentration of fluid-filled fractures. Using numerical models relating seismic velocities and fracturing, we solve for the lateral variation in concentration of \u223c0.01 aspect ratio fluid-filled fractures. We find that areas near the Kaik\u014dura rupture have >3% elevated fracture porosity compared to the adjacent area to the north. The elevated regional fracturing in the Kaik\u014dura area is interpreted to result from more distributed deformation, and broader distribution of earthquakes, due to inefficient localization of strain from a regionally uniform strain rate field, highlighting the relationship between relative maturity of upper-crustal fault zones and lateral variability of regional upper-crustal properties.\n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           Plain language summary:\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  When earthquakes occur in immature fault zones (areas that have accumulated small total displacement), they tend to rupture multiple poorly developed faults of diverse orientations.

How these differences in maturation are reflected in the regional distribution of fractures is not well known. Here we use the arrival times of P and S waves from earthquakes to constrain seismic velocities (Vp and Vp\/Vs) and use numerical models to relate seismic velocities to fracture concentration. We focus on the Marlborough region of the South Island, New Zealand, where immature fault zones recently ruptured during the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake but which also has more mature fault zones <100 km away. We find elevated fracture concentrations (3% higher fracture porosity), indicative of more distributed deformation along immature fault zones relative to more mature fault zones. In immature settings, fracturing is not as effectively localized along individual fault traces, leading to a broadly distributed fracture network.\n               ","93":"\n                  We perform numerical simulations of sequences of earthquake and aseismic slip on planar rate and state faults separating dissimilar material within the 2-D plane strain approximation. We resolve all stages of the earthquake cycle from aseismic slip to fast ruptures while incorporating full inertia effects during seismic event propagation. We show that bimaterial coupling results in favorable nucleation site and subsequent asymmetric rupture propagation. We demonstrate that increasing the material contrast enhances this asymmetry leading to higher slip rates and normal stress drops in the preferred rupture propagation direction. The normal stress drop, induced by the bimaterial effect, leads to strong dynamic weakening of the fault and may destabilize the creeping region on a heterogeneous rate and state fault, resulting in extended rupture propagation. Such rupture penetration into creeping patches may lead to more frequent opening of earthquake gates, causing increased seismic hazard. Furthermore, bimaterial coupling may lead to irregular seismicity pattern in terms of event length, peak slip rates, and hypocenter location, depending on the properties of the creeping patches bordering the seismogenically active part of the fault. Our results highlight robust characteristics of bimaterial interfaces that persist over long sequence of events and suggest the need for further exploration of the role of material contrast in earthquake physics and models of seismic hazard.\n               ","94":"\n                  Geochemical heterogeneities observed in the mantle are usually attributed to recycling of oceanic lithosphere through subduction. However, it remains hotly debated where recycled material stagnates, and how quickly it can be liberated back to surface. This knowledge gap hinders our understanding of mantle circulation and the chemical evolution of the Earth. Here we address these questions using a combination of geochronology and geochemistry from South China Sea (SCS) seamounts. The Shixingbei seamount lavas formed during active seafloor spreading at c. 19.1 Ma show limited geochemical variability, whereas the Zhenbei-Huangyan seamount chain formed during the post-spreading stage at c. 7.8 Ma and displays a wide range of compositions. However, melt inclusions in olivine and plagioclase from the Zhenbei-Huangyan basalts show considerably greater isotopic variability than seen in the whole rock compositions of both the SCS syn- and post-spreading lavas. A previously unidentified third mantle source component (FOZO) revealed by olivine-hosted melt inclusions along with both depleted (DMM) and enriched (EMII) mantle components is required in the source region to explain the observed isotopic and chemical variability. On the basis of our results, the age of the recycled ocean crust and sediments in this region are estimated to be c. 120 \u2013 350 Ma. We infer that these enriched components in the SCS lavas come from the mantle transition zone. Variations in mantle source heterogeneity coupled with melting process control spatial\u2013temporal (spreading vs. post-spreading stage) geochemical variations of lavas from the SCS and surrounding areas. Together with the results from published studies, we propose that marginal basins are one of the major locations on Earth where oceanic and\/or continental lithosphere is transferred into the upper mantle and transition zone, representing an important source of upper mantle heterogeneity. We provide a simple conceptual model linking plate subduction and upper mantle heterogeneity and the volcanism in the SCS and surrounding areas.\n               ","95":"\n                  Cosmochemical considerations suggest that sulfur is a candidate light alloying element in rocky planetary cores, such that the high pressure-temperature (P-T) Fe-S phase relations likely play a key role in planetary core crystallization thermodynamics.

To 200 GPa, Fe5S2 and Fe are observed to coexist at high temperatures while Fe2S polymorphs are identified with Fe at lower temperatures. An updated Fe-rich Fe-S phase diagram is presented. As this hexagonal Fe5S2 expresses complex Fe-Fe coordination and atomic positional disorder, crystallization of Fe5S2 may contribute to intricate elastic and electrical properties in Earth and planetary cores as they crystallize over time. Models of a fully crystallized Fe-rich Fe-S liquid in Earth's and Venus' core establish that Fe5S2 is likely the only sulfide to crystallize and may deposit in the outer third of the planets' cores as they cool. Fe5S2 could further serve as a host for Ni and Si as has been observed in the related meteoritic phase perryite, (Fe, Ni)8(P, Si)3, adding intricacies to elemental partitioning during core crystallization. The stability of Fe5S2 presented here is key to understanding the role of sulfur in the crystallization sequences that drive the geodynamics and dictate the structures of Earth and rocky planetary cores.\n               ","96":"\n                  The surface of Mercury is enriched in sulfur, with up to 4 wt.% detected by the NASA MESSENGER mission, and has been challenging to understand in the context of other terrestrial planets. We posit, that magmatic S was mobilized as a gas phase in volcanic and impact processes near the surface, exposing silicates to a hot S-rich gas at reducing conditions and allowing conditions for rapid gas-solid reactions. Here, we present novel experiments on the reaction of Mercury composition glasses with reduced S-rich gas, forming Ca- and Mg-sulfides. The reaction products provide porous and fragile materials that create previously enigmatic hollows on Mercury. Our model predicts that the gas-solid reaction forms Ca-Mg-Fe-Ti-sulfide assemblages with SiO2 and aluminosilicates, distinct from formation as magmatic minerals.

Here we show that massive gypsum deposits of the Mediterranean salt giant \u2013 the youngest salt giant on Earth \u2013 formed in a particularly dynamic biogeochemical environment controlled by orbitally-driven climate oscillations at the precessional scale. Using multiple sulfur isotopes combined with a steady-state sulfur cycle model, we show that, prior to gypsum precipitation, more than 80% of its constituting sulfate was first microbially reduced into sulfide, possibly stored as elemental sulfur, and then almost completely microbially reoxidized back to sulfate. This \u201ccryptic\u201d sulfur cycling contemporaneous to gypsum precipitation implies both negligible net sulfate consumption and sulfide production, despite a significant benthic flux of organic carbon remineralized through microbial sulfate reduction. This is the first known evidence of cryptic sulfur cycling in the geological past.\n               ","98":"\n                  Elevated water contents in various lunar materials have invigorated the discussion on the volatile content of the lunar interior and on the extent to which the volatile element inventory of lunar magmatic rocks is controlled by volatility and degassing. Abundances of moderately volatile and siderophile elements can reveal insights into lunar processes such as core formation, late accretion and volatile depletion. However, previous assessments relied on incomplete data sets and data of variable quality. Here we report mass fractions of the siderophile volatile elements Cu, Se, Ag, S, Te, Cd, In, and Tl in lunar magmatic rocks, analyzed by state-of-the-art isotope dilution-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The new data enable us to disentangle distribution processes during the formation of different magmatic rock suites and to constrain mantle source compositions. Mass fractions of Cu, S, and Se in mare basalts and magnesian suite norites clearly correlate with indicators of fractional crystallization. Similar mass fractions and fractional crystallization trends in mafic volcanic and plutonic rocks indicate that the latter elements are less prone to degassing during magma ascent and effusion than proposed previously. The latter processes predominate only for specific elements (e.g., Tl, Cd) and complementary enrichments of these elements also occur in some brecciated highland rocks. A detailed comparison of elements with different affinities to metal or sulfide and gas phase reveals systematic differences between lunar magmatic rock suites. The latter observation suggests a predominant control of the variations of S, Se, Cu, and Ag by mantle source composition instead of late-stage magmatic degassing. New estimates of mantle source compositions of two low-Ti mare basalt suites support the notion of a lunar mantle that is strongly depleted in siderophile volatile elements compared to the terrestrial mantle.\n               ","99":"\n                  We analyzed broadband and low-frequency events recorded on Mars and made the first detection of horizontally polarized shear wave reflections, which help constrain the crustal structure at NASA's InSight lander site. Coherent signals from five well-recorded marsquakes appear to be independent of the focal depth and are consistent with SH-wave reflections off the topmost crustal interface (8 \u00b1 2 km). This phase confirms the existence of the \u223c8 km interface in the crust and the large wave speed (or impedance) contrast across it. The range of acceptable parameters determined from the detected SH-wave reflections differs from the majority of the vertically polarized shear wave models resulting from a previous receiver function study, indicating that the velocity of the vertically polarized waves is larger than that of horizontally polarized waves. We propose that this inconsistency results from the presence of seismic anisotropy within the top crustal layer at the lander site.

It has been recognized that low Au grades generally characterize porphyry deposits in thick continental arcs, like the Andes, where the magmas are likely to differentiate at depth. In contrast, Au-rich porphyries are mainly found in thin island arcs, for example, those of the southwest Pacific, or associated with short extensional periods in continental arcs, where the magmas are likely to experience relatively shallow differentiation. However, the key factors that control this difference remain debated. This study shows that the Au grade of giant porphyry deposits and La\/Yb ratios of the ore-associated suites are negatively correlated (\n                        r\n                        =\n                        \u223c\n                        0.7\n                     , \n                        p\n                        =\n                        \n                           \n                              10\n                           \n                           \n                              \u2212\n                              7\n                           \n                        \n                     ). We attribute the negative correlation to be mainly due to varying sulfide saturation histories, modulated by the depth of magma differentiation.\n                  Magmas differentiating in deep crustal reservoirs are likely to reach sulfide saturation early due to high pressure and early depletion of FeO (calc-alkaline trend). Early sulfide saturation causes most Au to be held in cumulus sulfides, making it unavailable to enter ore-forming fluid released in the upper crust, resulting in Au-poor porphyry systems. In contrast, magmas evolving in shallow reservoirs are likely to experience late sulfide saturation because of the high sulfur solubility induced by low pressure and the high FeO content of the melts (tholeiitic trend). Late sulfide saturation enhances the potential of a magmatic system to form Au-rich porphyry deposits due to the high Au content of the magma at voluminous fluid saturation and efficient Au transfer from melt to the ore-forming fluids via sulfide-fluid interaction. The link between average magma differentiation depth and Au content is supported by platinum-group element geochemistry of the porphyry ore-forming suites, which shows that the magmas differentiating at shallower depths (lower La\/Yb) reach sulfide saturation later and therefore have higher Au concentrations than those that differentiate at deeper levels (higher La\/Yb). Numerical models for ore-associated magmas with different sulfide saturation histories indicate that variations in the Au grades of giant porphyry deposits can be explained by the variations in the timing of sulfide saturation. Based on the results, we propose that Au concentration in the magma, modulated by average magma differentiation depth and sulfide saturation history, is one of the critical factors controlling the Au grade of giant porphyry Cu deposits.\n               ","101":"\n                  Barred olivine (BO) chondrules are small ferromagnesian silicate igneous droplets with unique dendritic textures that are considered to have formed in the early solar system during one or more brief high-temperature episodes, followed by rapid cooling in a gas. Rapid cooling rates of 100\u20137200 \u00b0C\/h during chondrule formation have been proposed based on experiments attempting to reproduce BO crystal textures. However, the BO texture has never truly been reproduced under such rapid cooling conditions. Here, we experimentally show that true BO textures can be produced either after rapid cooling (>50 \u00b0C\/h) following by reheating step or by cooling rates slower than 10 \u00b0C\/h. Regardless of the thermal history considered, the chemical compositions of glass inclusions trapped within olivines of BO chondrules imply a final slow cooling rate one to two orders of magnitude below previous estimates. Such slow cooling rates are consistent with those estimated for plagioclase-bearing porphyritic chondrules and magmatic type-B Ca-Al-rich inclusions, suggesting that slow cooling rates are common to all similar chondritic objects.\n               ","102":"\n                  Lithological and isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle archive the mantle's melting history and fingerprint crustal recycling processes coupling the deep Earth with the terrestrial biosphere. Oceanic basalts, consisting of ocean island basalts (OIBs) and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), are invaluable tools for studying the chemical evolution of the mantle because they sample mantle heterogeneity at a variety of depths and length scales. In this study, we probe mantle heterogeneity by exploring the systematics of stable Ca isotopes in OIBs and MORBs.

Calcium-isotope variability in OIBs requires two-component mixing of melts with distinct \u03b4\n                     44\/40Ca values, one of which is a high-degree melt consistent with derivation from average peridotite with BSE \u03b4\n                     44\/40Ca. The melt-mixing endmember with isotopically light Ca (\u22640.70\u2030) must be a deep, low-degree melt. This low-degree melt cannot be derived from a peridotite source with BSE \u03b4\n                     44\/40Ca, but instead requires either a source with lower-than-BSE \u03b4\n                     44\/40Ca or a different source mineralogy. The isotopically light, low-degree melt is consistent with derivation from a pyroxene- and garnet-rich source, but the effects of mineralogical heterogeneity in the source regions of OIBs cannot be easily distinguished from the possible influence of Ca isotope heterogeneity in the mantle. Regardless, mixing of melts from a shallow peridotite source and a deep source appears to be a ubiquitous part of OIB petrogenesis.\n               ","103":"\n                  The global climate of the Ordovician Period (486.9 to 443.1 Ma) is characterized by cooling that culminated in the Hirnantian glaciation.

A lack of accurate gridded climate data is a major obstacle to land surface modelling, which is contributing to uncertainties in climate simulations. Here we developed a monthly gridded dataset of temperature and precipitation for MH China through applying eight interpolation methods to 159 pollen-based climate reconstructions for January and July from previous studies. The gridded dataset is consistent with these input records and other independent climate reconstructions at 62 sites.

The noble gas elemental and isotopic composition of the Earth's mantle traces the sources of Earth's volatiles as well as evolution processes, such as mantle degassing and regassing via subduction. However, ubiquitous shallow-level atmospheric contamination of mantle-derived samples has hampered determining the deep mantle heavy noble gas (Kr, Xe) isotopic and elemental composition. Moreover, the present-day elemental composition of the mantle reflects mixing of initial volatiles with atmospheric noble gases recycled through subduction that makes understanding the elemental signatures acquired during accretion difficult. Using a recently-developed protocol, we previously measured the krypton and xenon isotopic and elemental compositions of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland plume sources, which have among the most primitive helium and neon isotopic signatures, sampling one of the least degassed, most primordial mantle reservoirs. Based on these measurements, here we introduce a new approach to correct for recycling and hence determine the initial noble gas elemental ratios of the deep mantle. Our study leaves room for a substantial proportion of 36Ar in the mantle to be primordial in origin. Most importantly, we show that the deep mantle, prior to the injection of any atmospheric volatiles, was depleted in Xe relative to Kr by about two orders of magnitude when compared to chondritic compositions, and the Xe depletion was larger in the mantle than in the modern-day atmosphere. Unlike the atmosphere that has protracted history of Xe depletion through the Archean, the deep mantle xenon depletion was acquired very early in Earth's history, most likely during accretion. Hence, missing xenon in the Earth's interior and in the atmosphere appears to be two distinct problems. Three possible scenarios, potentially acting in sync, may have led to the mantle xenon depletion: Xe partitioning into the core, magma ocean outgassing and a xenon deficit in the Earth's parent bodies, such as comets.\n               ","107":"\n                  The laminated sedimentary sequence of Ecuador's Laguna Pallcacocha is one of the most widely cited proxy records of Holocene El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. Previous efforts to reconstruct flood-driven laminae from Laguna Pallcacocha relied solely on sediment color, a useful but non-specific metric of flood events. We improved the chronology with 210Pb and additional 14C dates over the past millennium, which allows for comparison of the sedimentary record with historically documented El Ni\u00f1o events. Additionally, we use elemental composition derived from X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) to reconstruct flood history at Pallcacocha. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the XRF dataset identifies minerogenic flood-driven clastic laminae. The first principal component (PC1) of the XRF data and red color intensity are positively correlated over the past 7.5 kyr, but the color record fails to capture high frequency variability that is preserved in the XRF dataset during the early Holocene (approximately 7.5-11 kyr BP). The new XRF dataset indicates moderate El Ni\u00f1o activity during the early Holocene, suppressed El Ni\u00f1o activity in the middle Holocene, and enhanced El Ni\u00f1o activity during the late Holocene. This pattern is relatively common among other ENSO records, and has been attributed to long-term changes in tropical insolation. Some intervals-most notably between 3-2 kyr BP and during the last millennium-deviate from expected trends if insolation was the sole forcing mechanism. Previously proposed mechanisms linking ENSO to latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ and ocean-atmospheric variabilities in other ocean basins appear to play an additional role in modulating Holocene ENSO development, as demonstrated by statistically significant correlations between the revised Laguna Pallcacocha flood history and proxy records from the Atlantic.\n               ","108":"\n                  IODP Site U1518, drilled during IODP Expeditions 372 and 375, penetrated a large-offset (\u223c6 km) thrust, the P\u0101paku fault, rising from a megathrust that hosts recurring slow slip events along the Hikurangi margin. Although drilling intersected the fault zone at only \u223c300 m below the seafloor within porous silty mudstone, it exhibits intense tectonic ductile deformation, including finely banded mudstones contorted into decimeter-scale folds; elongate mudstone clasts with grain tail complexes; stacked and truncated silt beds in distorted mudstones; and soft sediment injections. Locally, these ductile features are overprinted by brittle deformation, including normal faults, fracture arrays, and breccias. The more consolidated hanging wall is dominated by brittle structures, whereas the footwall exhibits ductile and brittle deformation that decreases in intensity with depth. The intense tectonic ductile deformation and asymmetric distribution of structures across the fault zone at Site U1518 can be explained by seafloor overthrusting. The emplacement of the hanging wall upon the footwall flat overrode high-porosity, undeformed, and previously unburied sediments, localizing shear deformation within these weak sediments. In contrast, the overconsolidated hanging wall preferentially experienced brittle deformation during folding and displacement. Interstitial pore water geochemical profiles at Site U1518 show a repetition of near-seafloor diagenetic sequences below the fault, consistent with overthrusting of previously unburied strata. The preserved diagenetic profiles in the footwall suggest that overthrusting occurred within the last 50-100 kyr, and indicate little along- or across-fault fluid flow at the location of Site U1518. Thus the P\u0101paku fault appears to define a low-permeability seal that restricts footwall consolidation, maintaining locally high pore fluid pressures and low fault strength. If similar low permeability structures occur elsewhere along the margin, they could support regionally high pore pressure conditions favorable to the occurrence of SSEs on the Hikurangi megathrust fault.\n               ","109":"\n                  To assist the identification of precursors to ruptures in segmented fault networks, we build discrete element method simulations of two parallel faults that are underlapping or overlapping, in releasing or restraining steps.

Elliptical craters record the trajectories of impacting materials and can thus be used to characterize the impactors' dynamics and facilitate crater interpretations. Here, we report evidence of a unique Saturn-orbiting impactor population, distinct from any previously described source population. This population is identified through global mapping and analysis of the elliptical crater populations on Saturn's moons Tethys and Dione. We report the presence of a strong signal of east\/west oriented elliptical craters located in the equatorial latitudes of both satellites. Poleward of 30\u00b0 the orientations of these craters become more widely distributed. On Tethys, a survey of a high latitude area (30\u00b0-60\u00b0 N) reveals that the non-elliptical craters are better matched by the production function constructed from craters on Triton than from the Jovian moons, although the high likelihood of planetocentric material in both the Saturnian and Neptunian systems precludes us from determining an absolute age using the Triton derived production function. Rather, we can conclude that the mid-sized Saturnian satellites have been strongly affected by a potentially similar collisional environment to Triton, giving rise to a Triton-like crater population along with a unique population that is not observed at Triton. Origin scenarios for the elliptical craters on Tethys and Dione would have to explain the orientation and latitudinal clustering of east\/west oriented craters, as well as the characteristics of the azimuthally isotropic population, which requires evenly distributed cratering across each satellite without a preferred impact direction. These characteristics can serve as constraints on the formation and evolution of the Saturnian satellites.\n               ","111":"\n                  The Icelandic plume, a major mantle upwelling located beneath the North Atlantic Ocean, plays a dominant role in controlling periodic uplift of continental margins and of oceanographic gateways during Cenozoic times.

To detect giant slope failures consistently throughout the region, we train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), AlexNet and U-Net, with Sentinel-2 optical data and TanDEM-X topographic data on elevation, surface roughness, and curvature. We validated the performance of these CNNs with independent testing data and found that AlexNet performed better when learned on topographic data, and UNet when learned on optical data. AlexNet predicts a total landslide area of 12,000 km2 in a study area of 450,000 km2, and thus one of Earth's largest clusters of giant landslides. These are mostly lateral spreads and rotational failures in effusive rocks, particularly eroding the margins of basaltic plateaus; some giant landslides occurred along shores of former glacial lakes, but are least prevalent in Quaternary sedimentary rocks. Given the roughly comparable topographic, climatic, and seismic conditions in our study area, we infer that basalts topping weak sedimentary rocks may have elevated potential for large-scale slope failure. Judging from the many newly detected and previously unknown landslides, we conclude that CNNs can be a valuable tool to detect large-scale slope instability at the regional scale.

The ore and sulfide samples from the studied systems have positive \n                        \n                           \n                              \u03b4\n                           \n                           \n                              202\n                           \n                        \n                     Hg (0.70 \u00b1 0.39\u2030, 1SD, n = 49) and negative \n                        \n                           \n                              \u0394\n                           \n                           \n                              199\n                           \n                        \n                     Hg values (\u22120.12 \u00b1 0.05\u2030, 1SD, n = 49).

The volume of sediment currently stored in two major catchments was estimated using high-resolution LiDAR and geometric reconstructions of depth to bedrock. Seismic reflection data in Moran Bay reveals post-glacial sediment preserved behind a submerged moraine, which isolates the bay from the larger Jackson Lake depocenter. The volume of post-glacial sediment stored in the canyons and bay totals 173.82 \u00b1 19.5336.0 (\u00d710\u22123 km3), which translates to a catchment-wide sediment production rate of 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 mm\/yr. The rock-equivalent sediment volume in Moran Bay is 4.4 \u00b1 0.9 (\u00d710\u22123 km3), only \u223c2.6% of the total post-glacial volume. While the estimated sediment production rate in the canyons is similar to the uplift rate, the denudation rate derived from Moran Bay sediment is 0.004 \u00b1 0.001 mm\/yr, implying highly inefficient post-glacial sediment transport. The fluvial system has been disequilibrated by glacial erosion such that interglacial valley profiles lack the steepness needed to transport sediment, delaying sediment evacuation until the next glacial advance, or until uplift sufficiently steepens the fluvial system so that it regains efficiency. Furthermore, colluvial production rates in the deglaciated valleys are close to long-term denudation and uplift rates, suggesting that once topography has been equilibrated to glacial erosion processes, subsequent glaciers do not need to produce much bedrock erosion, but mainly sweep out accumulated sediment to maintain equilibrium.\n               ","118":"\n                  Water and molecular hydrogen evolution from Apollo sample 14163 and lunar regolith simulants LMS-1, a mare simulant, and LHS-1, a highlands simulant, were examined using Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) in ultra-high vacuum. LMS-1, LHS-1, and Apollo 14163 released water upon heating, whereas only the Apollo sample directly released measurable quantities of molecular hydrogen. The resulting H2O and H2 TPD curves were fit using a model which considers desorption at the vacuum grain interface, transport in the void space between grain-grain boundaries, molecule formation via recombination reactions and sub-surface diffusion. The model yielded a most probable H2O formation and desorption effective activation energy of \u223c150 kJmol\u22121 for all samples. The probability distribution widths of the effective activation energies were \u223c100\u2013400, \u223c100\u2013350, and \u223c100\u2013300 kJmol\u22121 for LMS-1, LHS-1, and Apollo 14163, respectively. In addition to having the narrowest energy distribution width, the Apollo sample released the least amount to water (103 ppm) relative to LMS-1 (176 ppm) and LHS-1 (195 ppm). Since essentially no molecular hydrogen was observed from the simulants, the results indicate that LMS-1 and LHS-1 display water surface formation, binding, and transport interactions similar to actual regolith but not the desorption chemistry associated with the implanted hydrogen from the solar wind. Overall, these terrestrial surrogates are useful for understanding the surface and interface interactions of lunar regolith grains, which are largely dominated by the terminal hydroxyl sites under both solar wind bombardment and terrestrial preparation conditions.\n               ","119":"\n                  There has been extensive debate about how to link sedimentary oxygen isotope records to changes in solid Earth and surface processes.

Among the 14 REE, neodymium (Nd) has received the most attention because its radiogenic isotope composition, expressed as \u03b5\nNd = [(143Nd\/144Nd)sample\/(143Nd\/144Nd)CHUR \u2212 1] \u00d7 104 where CHUR is the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir, gives additional constraints on the oceanic cycles of the REE (Goldstein and Hemming, 2003).\nThe applications of marine REE proxies have been hampered by our limited understanding of their modern oceanic budgets. Studies of marine Nd cycle have long identified a \u201cmissing source\u201d problem: the known riverine and atmospheric inputs are too small to balance the global budgets, and some \u223c90% of the required sources needed to maintain the ocean inventory appears to be \u201cmissing\u201d (Arsouze et al., 2009; Bertram and Elderfield, 1993; Tachikawa et al., 2003; Goldstein and Jacobsen, 1988).\nRecently, the discovery of large benthic fluxes from marine sediment, with \u03b5\nNd values that also satisfy the isotope budget, provides a promising candidate for this \u201cmissing source\u201d, leading to the \u201cbottom-up\u201d hypothesis of the marine REE cycles (Abbott et al., 2015a; Du et al., 2020; Haley et al., 2017). In this hypothesis, the sedimentary flux is the dominant source of ocean REE, and seawater \u03b5\nNd signatures are acquired at the sediment-water interface (SWI) rather than at the river\/atmosphere-ocean interface. Anomalous behavior of \u03b5\nNd at the SWI has been documented (Grenier et al., 2013; Lacan and Jeandel, 2005; Lambelet et al., 2018), suggesting that processes involved in Boundary Exchange are indeed critical to trace element and isotopic budgets. It is thus important to understand the mechanisms of early diagenesis within sediments that derive these benthic fluxes, and how these processes contribute to the broader concepts of Boundary Exchange (Jeandel, 2016).\nIf correct, the \u201cbottom-up\u201d hypothesis would significantly change our interpretations of marine REE proxies; for example, the use of \u03b5\nNd to trace paleo-circulation (Abbott et al., 2022; Du et al., 2020, 2018). However, studies of pore water REE concentrations and \u03b5\nNd are scarce and mostly observational, with the mechanisms regulating the flux obscured by the complexity of sedimentary processes.\nHere we report a reactive-transport model of the early diagenesis of Nd and \u03b5\nNd in marine sediments with the intent of establishing the \u201cbottom-up\u201d hypothesis in mechanistic and quantitative terms. We focus on deep-sea sediments where the benthic flux is the largest yet measured, potentially dominating the global budget (Abbott et al., 2015b; Du et al., 2020). We also present a test application of the model to a deep-sea site on the Oregon Margin, to date the only region for which a comprehensive pore water dataset exists (Abbott et al., 2019, 2016, 2015b, 2015a). We test three processes hypothesized to be critical in the diagenetic Nd cycle: (1) authigenesis of Fe-Mn oxides and phosphates (Schijf and Byrne, 2021; Takahashi et al., 2015; Bi et al., 2021; Abbott et al., 2016); (2) weathering of lithogenic sediments, for example silicate minerals (Abbott et al., 2022; Blaser et al., 2019; Du et al., 2020; Jeandel and Oelkers, 2015; Lacan and Jeandel, 2005), and (3) reverse weathering through conversion of biogenic silica to authigenic clay (Aller, 2014; Mackin and Aller, 1984). These processes are likely important for the sedimentary cycle of many trace elements and isotopes (TEIs), and our general modeling approach as well as the specific results for this site thus have implications for the global budgets of these TEIs. Our model also helps illuminate how authigenic phases acquire \u03b5\nNd diagenetically, thus providing key insights for the use of authigenic \u03b5\nNd in paleoceanography.\n\n\n2\nStudy region\nPaired REE and \u03b5\nNd measurements in pore water and sediment, as well as ancillary data needed by the model, have only been made by Abbott et al. (2019, 2016, 2015b, 2015a) at three sites on the Oregon margin, Northeast Pacific (Fig. 1\n). We choose to model site HH3000 at 3000 m water depth, because it has one of the highest benthic Nd fluxes yet measured (\u223c30 pmol\/cm2\/yr). The water column here has a uniform \u03b5\nNd of \u22122.4 \u03b5, but pore water \u03b5\nNd (\u22121.8 \u03b5) is more radiogenic, the first evidence that diagenetic processes can decouple bottom and pore water \u03b5\nNd.\nThe site underlies oxic bottom water (\u223c100 \u03bcM) and has a low organic carbon rain rate (200 \u03bcg\/cm2\/yr) (Lyle et al., 1992). These conditions lead to a weakly reducing shallow sediment package, with dissolved Mn (\u223c50 \u03bcM) higher than Fe (<10 \u03bcM) in pore water (Abbott et al., 2016). Sediments are composed mainly of terrigenous materials (\u223c90 wt%) with moderate organic carbon (OC) (\u223c1.8 wt%), significant biogenic opal (\u223c6 wt%), but negligible carbonate (\u223c0.05 wt%). The accumulation rate is \u223c13 cm\/kyr (Abbott et al., 2016; Lyle et al., 1992). Terrigenous sediments are delivered by small coastal rivers that drain across the Oregon Coastal Range and Cascade Arc. The mineral assemblage consists of quartz, plagioclase, chlorite and muscovite\/illite, with minor clinopyroxene, amphibole and volcanic glass (Abbott et al., 2019), reflecting their sources in the igneous and low-grade metamorphic rocks of the continental arc (VanLaningham et al., 2008).\n\n\n3\nDiagenetic modeling\nOurs is a classic 1D reactive-transport model describing the distributions of dissolved species in pore water and solid species in sediments (Boudreau, 1997). Physical transport includes molecular diffusion, burial and bio-irrigation for dissolved species, and bioturbation and burial for solid species. The model includes the classic sequence of organic matter decomposition, and uses the continuum formulation of the reactivity of organic matter. The model also includes secondary redox reactions, dissolution of biogenic opal, CaCO3 and precipitation of FeS\/FeS2. We also model pH for speciation calculations. Complete model details are given in the Supplementary Methods; here we only present those that relate to Nd and \u03b5\nNd.\nWe model 144Nd and radiogenic 143Nd as two separate tracers. The convention for reporting radiogenic \u03b5\nNd is to remove the natural and instrumental stable isotope fractionation by normalizing the 143Nd\/144Nd ratio to a fixed 146Nd\/144Nd ratio of 0.7219. A model of \u03b5\nNd thus has no need to consider stable isotope fractionation. Modeled Nd concentration is the sum of these two isotopes divided by the summed natural abundance (0.35971).

(5) when \n\n\n\u03a9\n\n\nillite\n\n\n>\n1\n.\n\n\n3.5\nModel simulations\nWe perform two types of simulations: baseline simulations and simulations that further add silicate weathering and reverse weathering. The baseline simulations include the sediment biogeochemical reactions and the authigenic Fe\/Mn oxides and phosphate phases, and we test both the reversible scavenging and co-precipitation formulations. In the silicate weathering and reverse weathering simulations, silicate phases are added to the sediments to study their behavior. We test the model sensitivity to the dissolution rates of silicates, and the precipitation rates of authigenic clay during reverse weathering.\nThe model domain is the top 50 cm of the sediment, representing \u223c3500 years of sedimentation. This depth domain is discretized into 200 intervals, with finer grid spacing close to SWI to capture the large biogeochemical gradients there, resulting in 6600 coupled and stiff differential equations in the baseline simulations. Boundary conditions and the model solution are described in the Supplementary Methods.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nSediment biogeochemistry\nThe model reproduces the classic redox sequence at site HH3000 (Fig. 2\n). The depth-integrated OC remineralization rate is 0.5 mmol\/m2\/d, typical of this margin at similar water depth (McManus et al., 2012). The remineralization pathway is dominated by aerobic respiration (37.6%) and sulfate reduction (52.6%) (Fig. 2a). Despite its importance, sulfate reduction is still far from complete, with only \u223c0.5 mM of SO4 consumed in the top 50 cm (Fig. 2f) and little formation of Fe sulfides (\u223c0.12 wt%, Fig. 2e). Denitrification (8.0%) and MnO2 reduction (1.6%) also contribute to carbon remineralization, but there is little FeOOH reduction (0.25%) and methanogenesis is negligible (Fig. 2a). Organic carbon respiration slightly decreases pH from \u223c7.7 in the bottom water to \u223c7.3 in the deep pore water (Fig. 2i). Pore water total silica concentration is relatively high (\u223c620 \u03bcM, Fig. 2g) because of high opal content.\nIn the model, the surface bioturbated layer is \u223c 6 cm thick. To fit the OC profile (Fig. 2d), the initial age of OC in the continuum reactivity model is 60 yr, higher than that of fresh phytoplankton but within the range observed in deep-sea studies (Arndt et al., 2013). To fit the dissolved phosphate profile (Fig. 2h), the required P\/C ratio is 1\/170, lower than the classic Redfield ratio (1\/106). Together, the lower reactivity and P\/C imply the presence of refractory terrestrial OC at this site (Hastings et al., 2012).\nAssuming sediments below 6 cm represent the lithogenic background, the excesses of MnO2, presumably authigenic, are \u223c0.45 wt% near the surface (Fig. 2d) (Abbott et al., 2016). Modeled surface sediment MnO2 (\u223c0.05 wt%) has to be lower than this value to fit the pore water Mn profile (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the surface enrichment might be a transient feature, or that other interfaces or microbial processes are involved but not modeled. Estimated authigenic (0.5 wt%) and modeled (0.2 wt%) FeOOH are similar (Fig. 2d). The authigenic enrichment of Fe is thus much lower than Mn, given the higher lithogenic background for Fe (\u223c5 wt%) versus Mn (\u223c0.07 wt%). Model results are consistent with elemental mapping using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), which shows that Fe is located mainly in silicates, while Mn is enriched in amorphous nanoparticles that are likely authigenic (Abbott et al., 2019). Modeled Mn cycling is more intense than Fe cycling, at rates one order of magnitude higher for Mn than Fe (Fig. 2d). The modeled benthic Mn flux is 0.14 \u03bcmol\/m2\/d, in the range of measurements at similar depths at this margin (McManus et al., 2012). The modeled benthic Fe flux is \u22120.005 \u03bcmol\/m2\/d, also consistent with measurements (McManus et al., 1997).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nAuthigenesis\nAuthigenesis has typically been considered the main process affecting the early diagenesis of REE (Haley et al., 2004; German and Elderfield, 1989), which in turn has justified the assumption that pore water and authigenic Nd are simply derived from bottom water Nd at the SWI (Goldstein and Hemming, 2003). Here we investigate to what degree authigenesis alone can explain the observations of the diagenetic Nd cycle.\n\n5.1.1\nAuthigenic Fe\/Mn oxides and co-precipitation\nOur co-precipitation formulation is controlled by the partition coefficients (D). We use the results of the GEOTRACES Pacific GP16 cruise (Haley et al., 2021; Lam et al., 2018) to derive these parameter values. \n\n\nD\n\n\nN\nd\n\/\nM\nn\n\n\n is calculated as \n(\nN\n\n\nd\n\n\nauth\n\n\n\/\n\n\nMnO\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\/\n(\nN\n\n\nd\n\n\nd\n\n\n\/\nM\n\n\nn\n\n\nd\n\n\n)\n. \nN\n\n\nd\n\n\nauth\n\n\n is the measured particulate Nd corrected for lithogenic background, using a lithogenic Nd\/Al mass ratio of \n3.375\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n and measured particulate Al. Data for authigenic MnO2, FeOOH, dissolved Nd and Mn are from the cited studies (Haley et al., 2021; Lam et al., 2018). We find \n\n\nD\n\n\nN\nd\n\/\nM\nn\n\n\n=\n0.025\n and \n\n\nD\n\n\nN\nd\n\/\nF\ne\n\n\n=\n0.005\n in the deep-sea (>2500 m). Using these values, the fluxes of Nd carried by MnO2 and FeOOH into sediments at the study site are 612 and 40 pmol\/cm2\/yr, respectively, based on the MnO2 and FeOOH fluxes in the model (Supplementary Information).\nFor co-precipitation, the modeled pore water and authigenic Nd agree well with measurements (Fig. 3\n). MnO2 reduction (by POC, Fe2+ and H2S) is predicted to be the major source of pore water Nd (Fig. 3d), while Mn oxidation (by O2) is a small sink. The depth-integrated MnO2 reduction source (647 pmol Nd\/cm2\/yr) far outweighs the Mn oxidation sink (35 pmol Nd\/cm2\/yr). In comparison, FeOOH reduction (by POC and H2S) is a much smaller source of pore water Nd (Fig. 3d), while Fe oxidation (by O2 and MnO2) is a relatively larger sink. The depth-integrated FeOOH reduction source (120 pmol Nd\/cm2\/yr) slightly exceeds the Fe oxidation sink (80 pmol Nd\/cm2\/yr).\n\n\n5.1.2\nAuthigenic Fe\/Mn oxides and reversible scavenging\nThe reversible scavenging formulation is controlled by the adsorption constants (\n\n\nK\n\n\nads\n\n\n). We use values of \n\n\nK\n\n\n\nads\n\n-\n\n\nMnO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n7\n\n\n (M\u22121) and \n\n\nK\n\n\n\nads\n\n-\n\nFeOOH\n\n\n\n=\n0.8\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n7\n\n\n (M\u22121), to deliver the same amount of Nd to the sediment via Fe\/Mn oxides as in the co-precipitation simulation (Supplementary Methods).\nThese model results cannot explain the pore water Nd profile (Fig. 4\n). Modeled peak Nd concentration is far deeper than measured (Fig. 4c). Model sensitivity tests show that by varying \n\n\nK\n\n\nads\n\n\n the magnitude of the peak Nd concentration would change, but it would not affect the depth of the peak (Supplementary Fig. 1). This is because, in the presence of MnO2 and FeOOH, Nd remains in the adsorbed form, and is converted to dissolved Nd only when the concentrations of oxides greatly decrease (Fig. 4b). In contrast, in the co-precipitation formulation Nd is released to pore water as soon as oxide reduction begins (Fig. 3d). The failure of reversible scavenging is perhaps not surprising given that reversible adsorption is a first step toward irreversible structural incorporation (co-precipitation), and laboratory experiments have identified the gradual structural incorporation of adsorbed trace metals into Mn oxides (Atkins et al., 2016).\nMost existing ocean models rely on reversible scavenging to explain increasing seawater REE (and other TEIs) concentrations with increasing water depth in the open ocean (Arsouze et al., 2009; Siddall et al., 2008), on the premise that the concentrations of particulate scavengers decrease with depth. However, no ocean REE model has included Fe\/Mn oxides, despite the fact that they are amongst the most important scavengers, especially in the deep ocean (Schijf et al., 2015). If Fe\/Mn oxide concentrations in seawater increase with depth, as recent GEOTRACES results have shown (Lam et al., 2018), reversible scavenging onto Fe\/Mn oxides would predict a decrease, rather than an increase, of seawater REE concentrations with depth. Our results do not necessarily indicate that adsorption is unimportant, but rather that the reversible scavenging formulation in present ocean models may be unsuitable to describe this process, or that kinetic rather than equilibrium process may better describe particulate-dissolved interaction in seawater. We suggest that future studies need to include Fe\/Mn oxides to robustly evaluate the appropriateness of reversible scavenging.\n\n\n5.1.3\nAuthigenic phosphate\nSolid REE concentrations in Pacific sediments are most strongly correlated to phosphate, more so than Fe\/Mn oxides and other elements (Bi et al., 2021). Also, bio-apatite becomes strongly enriched in REE post-deposition (Toyoda and Tokonami, 1990). Diagenetic Nd formed on foraminiferal tests is associated with oxides, but also phosphorous (Roberts et al., 2012). Transformation of labile Fe\/Mn oxide-associated REE to stable phosphate phases has been identified in pelagic sediments, suggesting phosphate is likely the ultimate sink of REE (Takahashi et al., 2015). Whether REE form their own phosphate minerals, are incorporated into authigenic Ca-phosphates, or are taken up by biogenic phosphate, is unclear. In the model, we choose rhabdophane, a common REE mineral forming in low-temperature environment (Gausse et al., 2016; Liu and Byrne, 1997; Pearce et al., 2013), as the authigenic phosphate (NdPO4), largely because relevant thermodynamic data exist.\nLiterature values of \nlog\n\u2061\n(\n\n\nK\n\n\ns\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\nNdPO\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n) at standard state and zero ionic strength are in the range of \u221226 \u223c \u221224 (Gausse et al., 2016).

Model sensitivity tests show that the higher end of solubility estimates fits the pore water Nd profile better (Supplementary Fig. 2), which could be because either greater pressure leads to higher solubility than reported values at the standard state, or because NdPO4 formed in sediments is less crystalline than the versions used in some solubility experiments (Gausse et al., 2016).

Pore water becomes oversaturated below \u223c1 cm. Close to the SWI, solid NdPO4 that is formed in the over-saturation zone beneath is brought up to the under-saturation zone by bioturbation, and its dissolution is a greater source of pore water Nd than MnO2 reduction (Fig. 3d, e). Overall, phosphate precipitation is the dominant sink of pore water Nd, far surpassing that of Fe\/Mn oxidation (Fig. 3d\u2013e). As modeled oxides disappear below 30 cm, the model predicts pore water Nd concentration that are nearly at equilibrium with NdPO4 (Fig. 3g). The modeled total (MnO2, FeOOH and phosphate related) authigenic Nd concentration (\u223c9 ppm) also matches estimates based on an operationally defined acid-reductive leaching (Abbott et al., 2016). Though leaching studies of authigenic Nd have traditionally focused on the role of Fe\/Mn oxides, it is well-known that the acetic acid used in these studies can also extract authigenic and biogenic phosphates (Ruttenberg, 1992).\n\n\n5.1.4\nAuthigenesis and benthic flux\nThe benthic Nd flux in the model is affected by molecular diffusion and bio-irrigation (i.e., convective exchange between pore water and bottom water due to the activity of benthic organisms) (Supplementary Methods). Using the co-precipitation formulation and including authigenic phosphate, the modeled diffusive flux is 39 pmol\/cm2\/yr, agreeing well with the estimate (24\u223c41 pmol\/cm2\/yr) based on the measured pore water profile (Abbott et al., 2015b). The model uses the bio-irrigation parameterization of Meile and Van Cappellen (2003), derived from the globally measured O2 flux. The resulting bio-irrigation Nd flux is 20 pmol\/cm2\/yr. This value is an upper limit because the impact of bio-irrigation on other dissolved species is likely weaker than on O2 (Meile et al., 2005). Taken together the total benthic flux is 59 pmol\/cm2\/yr.\nThe authigenic minerals influence the benthic Nd flux in different ways. Both MnO2 and NdPO4 are sources of pore water Nd at the SWI, and thus support the benthic flux. However, when integrated over the sediment column, MnO2 is a net source of pore water Nd while NdPO4 is a net sink (Fig. 3d\u2013f). In contrast, FeOOH is a sink of pore water Nd at the SWI and thus decreases the benthic flux (Fig. 3d\u2013f), despite the fact that FeOOH is a net source of pore water Nd integrated over the sediment column.\nIn summary, in the baseline simulation including only authigenesis, the early diagenetic Nd cycle at the study site can be described as near total (\u223c91%) conversion of Nd carried by incoming MnO2, and to a lesser degree FeOOH, to authigenic NdPO4, with a small fraction (\u223c9%) returning to bottom water via diffusion and irrigation. Since, in this model, all Nd sources ultimately come from incoming water column-derived Fe\/Mn oxides, modeled pore water and authigenic \u03b5\nNd are the same as bottom water (Fig. 3i).\n\n\n\n5.2\nSilicate weathering\nThe observed relatively small \u03b5\nNd difference (+0.6 \u03b5) between pore water and bottom water is an indication that bottom water \u03b5\nNd is strongly influenced by pore water \u03b5\nNd because of a large benthic flux (Abbott et al., 2016). To explain this difference additional processes must be invoked. Much larger differences between pore water\/authigenic and bottom water \u03b5\nNd exist elsewhere, linked to smaller benthic flux or reactive lithogenic sediments (Abbott et al., 2016; Blaser et al., 2019; Du et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2013). Moreover, variations in authigenic \u03b5\nNd on glacial-interglacial timescales are only on the order of 1\u223c2 \u03b5, sometimes correlated to changes of lithogenic sediment \u03b5\nNd (Du et al., 2020 and references therein). It is thus important to understand \u03b5\nNd differences on this order of magnitude for robust circulation reconstruction.\n\n5.2.1\nThe reactive spectrum of silicate minerals\nOur next model iteration investigates the impact of marine silicate weathering on the diagenetic cycle of \u03b5\nNd, focusing on mineral reactivity. We model four phases: basaltic glass, clinopyroxene, chlorite and plagioclase (albite): all present in the study region (Abbott et al., 2019; VanLaningham et al., 2008). Volcanic glass, often derived from ash deposition that reaches far into the ocean interior, is ubiquitous in Pacific sediments (Du et al., 2020; Straub and Schmincke, 1998). Clinopyroxene is a mafic mineral that is commonly found in sediments near volcanic arcs. Chlorite often exists as a clay mineral, as the metamorphic alteration production of igneous minerals (Griffin et al., 1968). Plagioclase is not necessarily volcanic but it is the most abundant primary silicate mineral, after quartz, in marine sediments (Li and Schoonmaker, 2014). Collectively they represent a large range of silicate reactivity in terms of abundance, dissolution rate and solubility.\nWe add these phases separately to the baseline model, with deposition fluxes that are proportional to the total incoming sediment: 2 wt% of basalt glass and clinopyroxene, 10 wt% of chlorite and 20 wt% of plagioclase respectively, based on published abundance data in the study region (Abbott et al., 2019; VanLaningham et al., 2008; Zemmels and Cook, 1973). Interrogation of the GEOROC database (Supplementary Methods), either using data from the Cascade Arc or other convergent margins, suggests that the average Nd\/Si molar ratios of basalt glass, clinopyroxene and plagioclase are \n1.9\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n, \n1.8\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n and \n1.9\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with the partition coefficients of Nd in silicates (Taylor and McLennan, 1988). For chlorite, we use the average Nd\/Si ratio (\n1.6\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n) of clay minerals from rivers draining volcanic terrains, as compiled by Bayon et al. (2015). In comparison, the average Nd\/Si ratio of volcanic rocks from the Cascade Arc is \n1.7\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n, similar to that of basalt glass, clinopyroxene and clay, but 1-order of magnitude higher than plagioclase. The average \u03b5\nNd of Cascade volcanic rocks is +6.2 \u03b5 which we use for all four silicates. Dissolution parameters for these phases are reported in Supplementary Table 6.\nWe further assume that during silicate weathering the Nd\/Si dissolution rate ratio is the same as the Nd\/Si ratio in silicates (i.e., congruent dissolution). In the laboratory dissolution experiment of Pearce et al. (2013), the ratio of gross Nd\/Si release, estimated using \u03b5\nNd, from three basalt samples at the end of 121 days is \n\u223c\n2.5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n. This value is similar to the Nd\/Si ratio in their basalt samples (\n\u223c\n2.1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n), supporting our assumption. No other experimental studies of Nd and \u03b5\nNd during silicate dissolution exist to our knowledge, thus whether this assumption is true for other silicates is presently not tested.\nField-derived weathering rates are often lower than laboratory-derived values, a conundrum that has been attributed to inadequate dissolution rate laws, the loss of reactive surface sites due to occlusion, fluid transport limitation and the influence of secondary phases on saturation state (e.g., Maher et al., 2006). For example, Maher et al. (2006) suggested that the plagioclase dissolution rate in deep-sea sediments is 105 times lower than in the laboratory for the linear TST rate law at their study site. To investigate our model sensitivity, we vary the silicate dissolution rates by 6 orders of magnitude, from the laboratory-derived rates to values 1 to 5 orders of magnitude lower.\nAt higher dissolution rates, silicates are quickly consumed, while at lower rates greater amounts of minerals are preserved (Fig. 5\n). The modeled pore water Nd concentration, however, do not respond linearly to changes of dissolution rate (Fig. 5\u20136\n). In the upper sediment (<10 cm), dissolved Nd still largely agrees with the observed concentrations (Fig. 6), as silicate Nd release at even the highest dissolution rates are slower than Nd release from MnO2\/NdPO4 (Fig. 3). In the deeper sediment, modeled dissolved Nd exceeds the measured values at intermediate dissolution rates, but neither with the highest nor lowest rates: the former because the silicates are spent and the latter because dissolution is slow at all depths. Modeled dissolved Si is subject to a similar influence (Fig. 5).\nModel sensitivity also depends on mineral abundance, Nd\/Si ratio and solubility (Fig. 5\u20136). Modeled Nd, Si concentrations and \u03b5\nNd are not sensitive to dissolution of basaltic glass nor clinopyroxene because their Nd and Si reservoirs are small due to low abundance at the study site (Fig. 5a\u2013h, 6a\u2013h). In contrast, modeled Si concentration is very sensitive to plagioclase dissolution (Fig. 5i\u2013l) because it is more abundant and thus has greater potential to affect pore water chemistry, such as pH. This in turn drives large changes of Nd speciation and dissolved Nd concentration (Fig. 6i). The influence on \u03b5\nNd is however limited too because low Nd\/Si in plagioclase leads to a small Nd reservoir. In comparison, despite a relatively high abundance and large Nd reservoir, modeled \u03b5\nNd is not much more sensitive to chlorite dissolution rates because of its relatively low solubility (Fig. 5m\u2013p, 6m\u2013p).\n\n\n5.2.2\nBest-fit silicate weathering models\nConsidering the fit to observed pore water \u03b5\nNd, Nd and Si concentrations, the best-fit models include the weathering of volcanic phases such as basaltic glass and clinopyroxene, at dissolution rates within 2 orders of magnitude of laboratory-derived rates (Fig. 5a\u2013h, 6a\u2013h), and with their presence at <2 wt%. This relatively high reactivity may be explained by their \u201cfreshness,\u201d because of direct volcanic ash deposition, or fast physical erosion of volcanic rocks in the Costal Range and Cascade Arc, coupled to short transport times in coastal rivers and efficient dispersal of fluvial sediments on the Oregon margin (Wheatcroft and Sommerfield, 2005). In contrast, to explain pore water \u03b5\nNd requires that nearly all plagioclase dissolves, inconsistent with its observed abundance at \u223c20 wt%. The model using chlorite cannot fit Nd concentration and \u03b5\nNd simultaneously, and its abundance at \u223c10 wt% also suggests it is likely not reactive. The inferred low reactivity of plagioclase and chlorite implies that at site HH3000 these minerals are probably not of volcanic origin (i.e., sedimentary or metamorphic), and have experienced loss of reactivity before reaching the seafloor.\nAdding silicate weathering increases diffusive benthic Nd fluxes from 39 pmol\/cm2\/yr in the baseline model to 41\u223c42 pmol\/cm2\/yr in the best-fit models (the range is given for basalt weathering using dissolution rates that are \n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n times of laboratory-derived rate). Thus, the impact of silicate weathering on the elemental Nd benthic flux is likely non-measurable at site HH3000. In contrast, the \u03b5\nNd of the flux increases from \u22122.4 \u03b5 to \u22121.7 \u223c \u22121.3 \u03b5, a significant difference given the analytical uncertainty (\n2\n\u03c3\n=\n0.27\n\n\u03b5\n). Modeled pore water \u03b5\nNd is more radiogenic than bottom water (\u20132.4 \u03b5), and importantly, the trend of pore water \u03b5\nNd deviating toward bottom water \u03b5\nNd at \u223c5 cm is reproduced (Fig. 6c, 6g). This depth is where MnO2 reduction rate is at a maximum, and thus is the peak release for seawater derived Nd (Fig. 3d).\nModeled authigenic \u03b5\nNd is similar to pore water, but has a smoother profile (Fig. 6d, 6h), as authigenic phases integrate over longer timescales and are subject to bioturbation. However, modeled authigenic \u03b5\nNd is still not as radiogenic as the operationally defined leachate \u03b5\nNd (Abbott et al., 2016), suggesting that the leach likely extracts some non-authigenic components that are refractory under in situ sediment conditions but reactive in laboratory leaching (Abbott et al., 2022, 2016; Du et al., 2016). If the lower pH and wash off of major cations during leaching increases the dissolution rates and under-saturation of silicate minerals like plagioclase and chlorite, enough silicate Nd could be released, just as our model demonstrates (Fig. 6p). At site HH3000, a combination of \u223c8.5 ppm truly authigenic Nd (\u22121.8 \u03b5) with \u223c0.5 ppm Nd extracted from silicates (+6.2 \u03b5), can explain the leachate Nd (\u223c9 ppm and \u223c \u22121.2 \u03b5).\n\n\n\n5.3\nReverse weathering\nAuthigenic clay formation during reverse weathering can affect the saturation state of primary silicates by influencing pore water Al concentration (Maher et al., 2006), thus indirectly controlling the diagenetic Nd cycle. In the \u201cbest-fit\u201d silicate weathering models discussed above, we included reverse weathering using an authigenic illite precipitation rate of 10\u221219 mol\/m2\/s, as suggested by a previous study (Maher et al., 2006), but \u223c6 orders of magnitude lower than laboratory-derived rates (Marty et al., 2015).\nWe ran further sensitivity tests of the influence of reverse weathering by varying the authigenic illite precipitation rate (Fig. 7\n): 10\u221219 mol\/m2\/s in the \u201cnormal clay\u201d model; 10\u221216 in the \u201cfast clay\u201d; 10\u221222 in the \u201cslow clay\u201d, and 0 in the \u201cno clay\u201d (no reverse weathering) models. At the study site illite is also a detrital mineral through riverine input (VanLaningham et al., 2008). Therefore, in the model, we add a detrital illite flux that represents 2 wt% of the total sediment. We model the total illite concentration, with the authigenic fraction as the excess above the detrital input. In these tests we include basalt weathering as discussed previously, at a dissolution rate 10\u22121 times the laboratory-derived value.\nClose to the SWI (<0.2 cm), modeled Al and Si concentrations are positively correlated because of co-release by basalt and opal dissolution, but they become anti-correlated at depth because of authigenic illite formation, except in the \u201cno clay\u201d model wherein the positive correlation persists (Fig. 7e\u2013f, 8\n). At depth, the Al concentration converges to equilibrium values with respect to illite solubility in the \u201cfast clay\u201d model, but reaches an asymptote to values that are congruent to Si with respect to opal in the \u201cno clay\u201d model. Pore water total dissolved Al in the upper sediment increases from \u223c1 nM in the \u201cfast clay\u201d model to \u223c1000 nM in the \u201cno clay\u201d model (Fig. 7e), reducing basalt under-saturation, until over-saturation (Fig. 7g). Authigenic illite concentration is <1.2 wt% in all models.\nPore water Al was not measured at HH3000. We compare the modeled Al-Si relationship with published seawater and pore water data to evaluate if model results are reasonable (Fig. 8). Al-Si trends in the \u201cfast clay\u201d and \u201cnormal clay\u201d models follow that of deep ocean water (GEOTRACES Intermediate Data Product Group, 2021) and East China Sea pore water (Mackin and Aller, 1984). Al-Si trends in the \u201cnormal clay\u201d and \u201cslow clay\u201d models bracket pore water data from the North Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Amazon shelf (Mackin and Aller, 1986, 1986; Stoffyn-Egli, 1982; Van Beueskom et al., 1997). The Al speciation in the model considers only hydrolysis, but if other ligands are present, which is likely in reality, then the same free Al3+ concentration in the model would lead to greater total Al concentrations. Thus the modeled total Al concentration is likely a lower limit. Overall, we consider the \u201cnormal clay\u201d model the best option given its consistency with literature data and the uncertainty in Al speciation. As long as the precipitation rate is higher than in the \u201cslow clay\u201d model, reverse weathering will drive basalt weathering, and modeled pore water \u03b5\nNd will agree with observations (Fig. 7l).\nFinally, whether Nd is directly incorporated into authigenic clay is unknown. If it is, and assuming the same Nd\/Si ratio as primary silicates, the authigenic illite sink for Nd (<3 pmol\/cm3\/yr) (Fig. 7a) would be much smaller than the phosphate sink (\u223c200 pmol\/cm3\/yr) (Fig. 3d), and thus negligible.\n\n\n\n6\nImplications and perspectives\nThe modeled diagenetic Nd cycle at the study site is summarized in Fig. 9\n. Our aim was to investigate the roles of commonly suggested sedimentary processes, rather than comprehensively consider all potential processes. That the model successfully simulated observations indicates co-cycling with Fe\/Mn, authigenic phosphate formation, silicate weathering and reverse weathering are indeed among the most important at the study site. Future studies should aim to examine other potential processes, such as the role of organic ligands and colloids in pore water.\nOur study paves the way for modeling diagenetic Nd cycling at other sites and regions where the relative contributions of the studied processes may differ. For instance, site HH200 on the Oregon shelf (200 m) has a much larger pore water to bottom water \u03b5\nNd difference (+1.6 \u03b5) than the study site HH3000 (+0.6 \u03b5), corresponding to a greater abundance of volcanic phases like glass and clinopyroxene in sediments (Abbott et al., 2019). One would thus expect silicate weathering to be more important than at the deep-sea site HH3000.\nOur study also has global implications. With authigenesis alone, a benthic flux only produces regenerated Nd (Fig. 9), with significant impact on the oceanic budget of Nd concentration but not \u03b5\nNd. In contrast, silicate weathering produces a new external source of Nd (Fig. 9), which may have a small impact on the Nd concentration but a significant one on \u03b5\nNd, particularly when the \u03b5\nNd difference between seawater and reactive silicate phases is large. This contrast in elemental versus isotopic sensitivity mirrors seawater observations and implies that diagenetic transformation at the SWI is likely a key component of Boundary Exchange (Jeandel, 2016). The apparent conservative behavior of seawater \u03b5\nNd, in the presence of non-conservative Nd concentration due to benthic flux, can be preserved in the first case but not in the second. The reality is likely somewhere in-between (Du et al., 2020). We suggest the differing response of Nd concentration versus \u03b5\nNd to the benthic flux is key to resolving the \u201cNd paradox\u201d (Goldstein and Hemming, 2003).\nOur results may also explain why, globally, benthic Nd fluxes do not correlate to redox parameters such as bottom water oxygen and OC rain rate (Du et al., 2018). For example, strong redox cycling on the continental shelf does not convert to high benthic Nd flux (Abbott et al., 2015b; Deng et al., 2022) as it does for Fe and Mn (McManus et al., 2012, 1997). We suggest that the non-redox-sensitive Nd sink (phosphate) may play a more important role than the redox-sensitive source (Fe\/Mn oxides). If phosphate precipitation\/dissolution is fast enough, pore water Nd concentrations will be largely controlled by phosphate solubility, and only weakly dependent on redox cycling.\nOur model illustrates the indispensable role of pore water TEI data in constraining diagenetic processes and fluxes across the SWI. In our best-fit models, with 2 wt% basalt\/clinopyroxene supply to sediments, only <0.4 wt% remains at the surface, and none below 10 cm. Such small fractions are virtually undetectable by solid phase analysis methods, let alone when the solid phases have disappeared completely and leave only an imprint on pore water. Thus, it is likely not possible to study such processes using solid phase analysis alone: pore water TEIs may be our only source of evidence.\nThe processes investigated here also affect the diagenesis of other TEIs (Little et al., 2020; Jeandel, 2016). Presently, the application of diagenetic modeling to TEIs is limited by the scarcity of comprehensive pore water data and measurements of the fluxes of all solid components into sediments. As fluxes at the SWI are increasingly seen to be a key part of the global ocean budgets of TEIs (Homoky et al., 2016), it is important for further pore water and sediment trap TEI studies, as extensions of the GEOTRACES water column surveys.\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe created the first reactive-transport model for Nd and \u03b5\nNd in marine sediments, and quantified the roles of authigenesis, silicate weathering and reverse weathering in the early diagenetic Nd cycle at the deep-sea site HH3000 on the Oregon margin.\nThe model correctly captured the biogeochemical processes at the site and successfully simulated the observed pore water Nd profile using the co-precipitation formulation of Nd co-cycling with Fe\/Mn and authigenic phosphate formation. In the simulation, we found that MnO2 reduction is the main source of Nd in pore water, phosphate formation is the main sink, and Fe cycling plays a minor role. Benthic Nd flux is mainly driven by MnO2 reduction and phosphate dissolution close to the SWI. In contrast, the model cannot reproduce the pore water Nd profile via the reversible scavenging formulation of Nd co-cycling with Fe\/Mn.\nWe further included silicate weathering and reverse weathering to simulate pore water \u03b5\nNd. We studied the model's sensitivity to the dissolution of basaltic glass, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and chlorite, representing a wide range of mineral reactivity, abundance and solubility. The model correctly simulated pore water \u03b5\nNd (and other data) if it includes the weathering of basaltic glass or clinopyroxene with relatively high dissolution rates, supporting the hypothesis that weathering of volcanic sediments is responsible for the relatively more radiogenic \u03b5\nNd of pore water and authigenic phases in the Pacific. Furthermore, we show that reverse weathering is necessary to maintain relatively low pore water Al concentrations, thus enabling the undersaturation of primary silicates and indirectly contributing to the diagenetic Nd cycle.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJianghui Du: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft.

The geomagnetic field is generated by a self-sustaining geodynamo in the outer core through the movement of liquid iron by processes such as thermal and chemical convection. Reliable paleointensity data can therefore provide a vital constraint for numerical models aiming to solve related deep Earth problems and allow for statistical models that inform on core evolution (Aubert et al., 2009; Driscoll and Evans, 2016). They can also allow the testing of hypotheses such as the existence of an approximately 200 Myr quasi-periodicity in dipole strength which may be related to mantle forcing of the geodynamo (Biggin et al., 2012).\nSeveral geodynamo model outputs show that inner core nucleation (ICN) would produce an increase in average geomagnetic field strength observed at its surface (Aubert et al., 2009; Davies et al., 2022); the mechanism being the additional power generated from compositional convection and latent heat release driving the geodynamo (Buffett, 2010). However, a study by Landeau et al. (2017) found that the change from a \u2018top-down\u2019 to \u2018bottom-up\u2019 power regime may supress any intensity increase at Earth's surface; instead suggesting that a shift in field morphology might be more apparent.\nSome studies also predict that a dipole low preceded ICN (Bono et al., 2019; Driscoll, 2016; Landeau et al., 2017), and tend to suggest a nucleation age during or soon after the Ediacaran period (e.g., Labrosse, 2015; Driscoll and Evans, 2016; Bono et al., 2019; Mittal et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2022). Anomalous paleomagnetic field directions (Halls et al., 2015) and extremely weak paleointensity (Bono et al., 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2020; Thallner et al., 2021a,b) are reported throughout the Ediacaran period (635\u2013541 Ma). It is not entirely clear, however, that this anomalous behaviour is due to a weak-state geodynamo caused by substantially diminished thermal convection. We highlight that weak and unstable field behaviour can alternatively arise in geodynamo simulations from strong forcing whereby the multipolar transition is crossed (Olson, 2007).\nRegardless of the scenario, current paleointensity data do not present a well-populated, continuous time series of dipole moments, particularly in the early Phanerozoic to the Precambrian (Biggin et al., 2015; Bono et al., 2022), and variability resulting from secular variation or mantle forcing of the geodynamo could easily be misconstrued as a signal of ICN (Lloyd et al., 2021a). A greater understanding of long-term variability (10\u2013100 Myrs) of dipole moment is clearly necessary to help inform on these long-term trends and identify features related to the deep Earth; this requires additional reliable data from key time periods.\nThere are almost no data to determine whether the anomalously weak Ediacaran field extends into the Cambrian period (541\u2013485 Ma) and younger. For this reason, we have yet to identify the point at which the dipole moment begins to grow into the strong (on average) dipolar field known to exist for much of the late and post Paleozoic era (Biggin et al., 2015; Bono et al., 2022). This makes the mid-Paleozoic period a particularly interesting time for paleomagnetic research, particularly since several recent geodynamo and core-mantle models predict ICN ages as young as 400 Ma (Davies, 2015; Davies et al., 2022; Mittal et al., 2020). Unfortunately, only a single time-instantaneous paleointensity exists for the entire Cambrian period from the Ntonya Ring Complex intrusion in Malawi at 522 \u00b1 13 Ma (McClelland and Briden, 1996).\nHere, we revisit a study by McCausland et al. (2007), which obtained 40Ar\u201339Ar radiometric ages and consistent primary paleomagnetic directions for rocks of key Cambrian ages; the Chatham-Grenville (531.4 \u00b1 3.4 Ma) and Mont Rigaud (533.2 \u00b1 1.1 Ma) stocks of western Quebec and eastern Ontario. These early Cambrian stocks also baked and slow-cooled several \u223c590 Ma Grenville dykes, which are well-defined in terms of their geochemistry, petrography, and rock magnetic properties (Halls et al., 2015; Thallner et al., 2021a). In the original study, the Chatham-Grenville stock and nearby baked dykes displayed similar shallow directions, in contrast to those from distal parts of the same dykes. In addition, the paleomagnetic directions are equivalent to those of the nearby Mont Rigaud stock of similar age, and its baked host rock (McCausland et al., 2007).\nLocating most of the original 2007 sites more than a decade later was not possible, however, we were able to identify one of the \u223c590 Ma Grenville dykes that was baked by the Chatham-Grenville stock. Plutonic rocks are often challenging to produce reliable paleointensities from due to the presence of multidomain grains. The baked dyke has more favourable magnetic properties, but recorded a paleointensity over the same interval of time, which was likely several tens of thousands of years (see Discussion). From this dyke, we are able to report the first whole-rock paleointensity results for the Cambrian in almost three decades. These new data give an insight into the Cambrian paleomagnetic field, with possible implications for the state of the geodynamo.\n\n\n2\nGeological background & previous work\nThe Chatham-Grenville stock intruded into the Grenville structural province of the Canadian Shield. It can be divided into four units based on its structural features; two syenitic (Fig. 1\na; units 1 and 2) and two granitic intrusions (Fig. 1a; units 3 and 4). The two hornblende syenite units intruded first and are separated by a screen of country rock and an igneous breccia. These were followed by true granite units (3 and 4) with very little mafic mineral content (Higgins, 1985); the sequence represents a simple progressive increase in silica content (Greig, 1968). Unit 1 cross-cuts members of the east-west trending 590 Ma Grenville dyke swarm (Kamo et al., 1995).\nPrevious paleomagnetic directions were obtained from the Chatham-Grenville stock, the neighbouring Mont Rigaud stock of similar age, and from the Grenville dyke (McCausland et al., 2007). The two stocks and the baked section of Grenville dyke produced consistent shallow easterly directions that are interpreted to be of primary origin. Several positive baked contact tests were carried out from the baked zone of host gneiss and two of the 590 Ma Grenville dykes adjacent to unit 1 of the Chatham-Grenville stock. Both stocks produce a combined pole of 11.9\u00b0N, 4.6\u00b0E (\n\u03b1\n95\n=\n4.8\n) with a Q value of 6 (Van der Voo, 1990); this in is agreement with other Laurentian poles of similar ages (500\u2013550 Ma), which define the apparent polar wander path for Laurentia during this time (McCausland et al., 2007).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nSamples from the Chatham-Grenville stock (hereafter generally referred to as syenite samples) and the baked dyke were collected in 2017. Sites were labelled SCG1 to SCG8, where site SCG2 (baked dyke) and SCG3 are the originally named CG6 and CG3 (McCausland et al., 2007) respectively; all our other sites were not originally sampled. All samples used in this study were obtained using a hand operated drill and oriented using a magnetic compass and sun compass where possible. Specimens were named using a hierarchical approach such that, for example, a full inch cylindrical specimen named SCG2-6A denotes site 2, core 6, specimen A. An additional number (1 or 2) following the letter denotes a half specimen (where specimen A has been cut in half), and a further number is a 5 mm microwave specimen that has been drilled out of a half specimen.\n\n3.1\nRock magnetic experiments\nRock magnetic measurements were performed on samples from each site. A Magnetic Measurements Ltd Variable Field Translation Balance (VFTB) was used to obtain hysteresis loops, backfield coercivity, saturation isothermal remanence magnetization (sIRM) and high-field thermomagnetic curves of the saturation magnetization (MS-T). Hysteresis loops were measured using RockMagAnalyzer (Leonhardt, 2006), and corrected for the paramagnetic contribution to the slope above 0.5 T. Ratios of hysteresis parameters, remanent saturation magnetization\/saturation magnetization (MRS\/MS) and coercivity of remanence\/coercivity (BCR\/BC), were used to determine bulk domain stability (Paterson et al., 2017). Curie temperatures (TC) were calculated using the second derivative of the MS-T heating curves with a 3-point running average applied. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility (k-T) experiments were carried out up to 700\u00b0C in air, using an MFK1-FA Kappabridge with CS-3 furnace (AGICO).\nThe magnetic minerals present were analysed with a high-resolution, variable pressure Zeiss Gemini SEM 450, based within the University of Liverpool SEM Shared Research Facility. Backscatter electron imaging (BEI) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used for mineral identification and semi-quantitative elemental analysis for two thin sections; one from the intrusion (sample SCG3-5B) and another from the baked dyke (sample SCG2-6C).\n\n\n3.2\nPaleointensity experiments\nThe Shaw double heating technique (Shaw-DHT; Yamamoto et al., 2003), thermal Thellier method (Tauxe and Staudigel, 2004) and microwave method (Hill et al., 2002) were used to obtain paleointensity results. In addition, the Pseudo-Thellier method (Paterson et al., 2016) was used to check results from other methods. All measurements (except microwave) were performed using an automated RAPID 2G superconducting rock magnetometer in a magnetically shielded cage where the residual field was less than 100 nT. An Agico JR-6A spinner magnetometer was also used on some samples to measure the natural remanent magnetization (NRM).\nPaleointensity experiments were mostly limited to specimens from the baked Grenville dyke (site SCG2) with a small number of Shaw-DHT experiments performed on the syenite samples. The Shaw-DHT method protocols are well-documented (e.g., Lloyd et al., 2021b; Yamamoto et al., 2003); it compares the alternating field (AF) demagnetization spectrum of an NRM with that of a laboratory induced thermal remanent magnetization (TRM). Any alteration is measured by comparing the demagnetization spectrum of an anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), which is imparted prior to, and following the laboratory heating (TRM); the difference between each pair of equivalent ARM steps is applied as a correction to the corresponding TRM step.\nSeveral of the experimental inputs here were varied to test for non-linear TRM and alteration effects on the paleointensity estimate. The direct current (DC) bias fields used in the ARM and TRM varied from 30 to 70 \u03bcT and 10 to 20 \u03bcT respectively. Hold durations used to acquire the TRMs varied from 10 to 50 minutes. Two experiments were carried out in a Magnetic Measurements Ltd MMTD thermal demagnetizer and heated in a vacuum at 60\u00b0Cmin\u22121 to 500\u00b0C, then more slowly (5\u00b0Cmin\u22121) to 610\u00b0C; their hold durations for TRM1 (2) were 10 (25) minutes and 20 (30) minutes respectively. A third experiment used a Magnetic Measurements Ltd MMTDSC fast cooling thermal demagnetizer; hold durations were set for TRM1 (2) at 40 (50) minutes. Maximum AF demagnetization for all experiments was 100 mT with all samples heated to 610\u00b0C. The pseudo-Thellier method was applied to eight of the same samples that underwent Shaw experiments from the baked dyke; however, these are used only as a check on the Shaw results rather than as stand-alone results.\nThermal Thellier experiments were performed on 26 specimens from the baked dyke (Supplementary Table 5) using the IZZI+ protocol (Tauxe and Staudigel, 2004; Yu et al., 2004); this consisted of a sequence of alternating \u2018zero-field\u2019 and \u2018infield\u2019 paired heatings steps (ZI, IZ) in air, to a set of increasing temperatures. Partial TRM (pTRM) checks were measured after every two step pairs to continually assess the fidelity of the magnetic minerals throughout the experiment. Two separate experiments were carried out using AF pre-measurement treatments of 5 mT and 10 mT respectively; these were applied before each of the measurement steps to remove part of the viscous components of the magnetic signal. TRM bias fields were set to 15 and 8 \u03bcT respectively and hold durations were 50 minutes throughout. The selection criteria used to analyse the results of all experiments are given in Table 1\n.\nAn experiment was carried out to determine whether any of the paleointensities were affected by a difference in cooling rate. This was performed on ten of the samples from the first Thellier experiment and involved three infield heatings with alternating cooling durations (fast, slow, fast), where the slow cooling step took place over 20+ hours in a custom built, slow cooling oven with thick thermal insulation and no fan, at an approximate rate of \u223c0.4\u00b0C min\u22121 (Biggin et al., 2013).\nTwelve further paleointensity experiments were conducted on a 14.2 GHz microwave paleointensity system with low-temperature SQUID magnetometer (Suttie et al., 2010). The system produces magnons (quasi-particles associated with spin waves) to demagnetise small cylindrical cores (5 mm diameter) as the energy is increased; this is analogous to the mechanism of heat\/phonon in thermal experiments. The IZZI+ protocol was used in combination with the quasi-perpendicular method; the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) makes an angle of at least 45\u00b0 with the lab field (Hawkins et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nRock magnetic & microscopy results\nHysteresis parameters, analysed in terms of their bulk domain stability (BDS; Paterson et al., 2017) reveal that all the syenite samples are likely dominated by multidomain or large vortex state grains (Fig. 2\na, b). Their BDS values are an order of magnitude lower (\u223c0.01) than the threshold value (0.1) that was empirically determined to reject the specimens likely to yield the poorest paleointensity results (based on thermal experiments; Paterson et al., 2017). Samples from the baked dyke are distinctly grouped in a more stable region, significantly closer to BDS \u2265 0.1 but still below the threshold.\nThermomagnetic analysis of MS-T curves identifies distinct average TC values for the dyke and stock; the TC of the main ferrimagnetic phase range from 570\u2013580\u00b0C in the dyke and 580\u2013590\u00b0C in the stock (Fig. 2b, c & d). Therefore, pure magnetite or low Ti-titanomagnetite is recognised as the magnetic remanence-bearing mineral in the baked-dyke. High-temperature susceptibility (k-T) curves from the baked dyke are highly reversible, suggesting that the bulk magnetic material is not susceptible to alteration during heating (Fig. 2d).\nBackscatter electron (BSE) images from syenite sample SGG3-5B show large, altered magnetite grains in addition to various other opaque minerals of irregular size, shape, and alteration textures (Supplementary Figure 1). BSE images from dyke sample SCG2-6C (Fig. 3\na\u2013d) and their EDS analysis show a bimodal distribution of grain types; large grain assemblages (>100 \u03bcm) of altered and cracked low-Ti titanomagnetite that host large grain segments of high-Ti titanomagnetite or ilmenite. In addition, small trellis-like grains are apparent throughout and resemble oxidation state C2\/C3 (Figure 3b; Haggerty, 1991). These larger grains are surrounded by small (typically <5 \u03bcm to submicron) magnetite grains, some of which include high-Ti lamellae (Fig. 3d), scattered throughout the sample. In contrast to the larger, altered grains, these finer grains appear to be in pristine condition.\n\n\n4.2\nPaleomagnetic results\nSamples from the stock are dominated by multidomain grains (Fig. 2), and paleomagnetic directions obtained by AF demagnetization of the same sites were all randomly scattered (Supplementary Table 1). Representative samples from each of the sites underwent a pilot Shaw paleointensity experiment, which further confirmed that these are poor magnetic recorders (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, they are deemed unreliable for paleointensity determination and no paleointensity results are reported.\nThe NRM measured in dyke samples was very strong (\u223c10 Am\u22121). A significant overprint (as much as 90% of the total NRM) was present in all the specimens from the dyke, which was observed in the original 2007 study (McCausland et al., 2007). A principle-component analysis of the overprint reveals grouping of declination and inclination according to where the samples were obtained on the outcrop, which strongly suggests that an isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) was imparted by a lightning strike. However, the IRM did not affect the most stable magnetic fraction and was generally removed by AF demagnetization to 10\u201315 mT (Figs. 4\nb & c). After removal of the IRM, the Grenville dyke produces an average characteristic remanence direction (D = 93.9\u00b0, I = 22.7\u00b0, \n\u03b1\n95\n=\n4.9\n, k = 74.2, n = 11 specimens; Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Table 2) that overlaps with the average ChRM direction from the Chatham-Grenville stock (D = 89.3\u00b0, I = 30.1\u00b0; \u03b1 95 = 6.2, k = 38.8; N = 15 sites; McCausland et al., 2007).\nA large portion of the remanence is carried by low coercivity grains, which are overprinted by the IRM (Figs. 4b & c); it was therefore necessary to accept lower than usual f-values (Table 1; Supplementary Tables 2\u20135). However, after removal of the IRM, the amount of remanence remaining in each half-inch cylindrical specimen remained high in magnitude (0.5\u20131 Am\u22121 or 0.5\u2013\n1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n Am2; Fig. 4c). The Shaw method selection criteria used to assess the quality of the paleointensity slope have been adjusted stricter than usual to counterbalance the low fraction of remanence (Table 1).\nFourteen paleointensity results are obtained from the baked dyke from three independent methods; these are precise and consistently weak with an overall site mean of 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcT (Table 2\n).\nThe Shaw method produces the most results (10 out of 23 were successful) with a mean paleointensity of 3.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcT. The accepted specimens demonstrate little ARM alteration when comparing the demagnetization spectra of ARM0\/ARM1; the average alteration of successful specimens is 10% \u00b1 6%. Although slopeT is not used here as a strict selection criterion in the Shaw method (Lloyd et al., 2021b), all values were within 10% of unity, and all slopeT\n\n|\n\n\nk\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n|\n\u2264\n0.2\n (Figs. 5\na\u2013e; Supplementary Table 2).\nThe Pseudo-Thellier (PsT) method produces consistent results that are in support of, albeit weaker than, the other results; 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcT (n = 5\/8; Figs. 5f\u2013h; Supplementary Table 3). The error associated with the calibration factor is large (at least 25%; Paterson et al., 2016), although in absolute terms this would be less than 1 \u03bcT. Shaw results are obtained from the same specimens and so PsT results are used for cross-validation only. A single paleointensity result of 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcT was obtained using the microwave method (Figs. 5i & j; Supplementary Table 4). Specimens failed for several reasons, such as excessive curvature and alteration; however, the single result is moderately good quality (q = 5.0) and is consistent with results from other methods.\nThermal Thellier Arai diagrams all show an initial, large rapid loss of NRM (without pTRM gain), which is likely due to removal of the IRM. Similar effects observed in a non-heating (PsT method) technique suggests that this is not alteration related. Thellier experiments produced 3\/26 successful results (each from a separate core) after applying selection criteria (Table 1; Supplementary Table 5). For these accepted results, there are three well-correlated components distinctly evident in the Arai diagrams and orthogonal plots (Figs. 5k\u2013p). After the removal of the IRM, there is an intermediate component identified between blocking temperatures \u223c540\u2013570\u00b0C, after which the primary remanence unblocks. This small range of stable remanence is likely carried by a narrow size range of single domain grains scattered throughout the samples, consistent with BSE images (Fig. 3).\nRock magnetic experiments place the Curie temperatures firmly between 570 and 580\u00b0C (Fig. 2b & c) and a short experiment also confirmed that all the remanence is removed by 580\u00b0C. The bulk susceptibility was also measured after each pTRM check and remained stable throughout the thermal experiments (Supplementary Figure 3), which suggests that alteration of the magnetic minerals is low. This is consistent with the low ARM alteration observed in Shaw experiments, in k-T curves and in the accurate pTRM checks of successful Thellier specimens (Figs. 5k\u2013p).\nSince only 3\/26 of the Thellier experiments were successful, we carried out further analysis using the \u2018Bias Corrected Estimation of Paleointensity\u2019 (BiCEP) method (Cych et al., 2021) to aid the interpretation. Seven specimens were selected (Supplementary Table 6) based on their directional information (\u03b1 and MAD; Table 1) and parameters associated with alteration (\u03b4CK \u2264 12% and DRATS \u226417%), but with no constraint on the linearity of paleointensity slope applied.\nIn the BICEP method, instead of excluding specimens based on a set of selection criteria, the amount of bias for each specimen is predicted using the curvature of its Arai diagram as a metric. Firstly, the data from a site are resampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to produce several thousand pseudo samples. Bayesian statistics are then used to calculate the curvature with uncertainties, and an average paleointensity slope for each specimen. Resampling the data produced 21,179 effective samples providing a site mean paleointensity of 4.4 \u03bcT with a 95% confidence interval of 3.0\u20136.0 \u03bcT (Figs. 6\na & b). The calculated average paleointensity slope appears to be biased high with increasing curvature (Fig. 6a); these values hold less weight in determining the site-mean value. The site-mean result is classed as category C, which means that more samples are required to be analysed to provide a robust level of confidence. Nevertheless, the BiCEP results provide support for the successful Thellier results and show that multiple specimens were consistently producing similar strength paleointensity estimates. Moreover, they support the weak field results gathered throughout the study by multiple methods.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nPaleointensity fidelity\nThe site level paleointensity result for the baked dyke is considered robust with 14 specimen level results obtained by three independent methods and is supported by Pseudo-Thellier and BiCEP MCMC results. The number of Shaw results also far exceed the minimum requirement to achieve an accurate paleointensity (\u00b110% of the true mean) using the specified selection criteria (Lloyd et al., 2021b).\nBDS values for the dyke are slightly below the threshold for which reliable paleointensities are more likely. BDS is empirically based on the thermal Thellier-Coe method and is therefore undefined for the Shaw method; nevertheless, the bulk magnetic material likely includes an unstable MD contribution (Figs. 2a, 3a & b). The Shaw method uses a single heating to acquire a full TRM and is therefore less affected by MD remanence (Biggin and Paterson, 2014; Lloyd et al., 2021b), which is possibly why more results are obtained using this method. The other successful results produce linear paleointensity slopes which suggest that those results are unaffected by MD remanence. We therefore consider that the dyke mean estimate meets the QMD criterion of Biggin and Paterson (2014) in our assessment of the quality of paleointensity (QPI). The baked dyke (site SCG2) meets all the QPI criteria except QLITH (the site-mean averages more than one sample lithology), producing a high score of 9\/10. The individual scores and the reasons for obtaining these are outlined in Supplementary Table 7.\nThe primary remanence is associated with high unblocking temperatures (Figs. 5k\u2013p; Supplementary Table 5), and there is evidence of thermally stability; this is from near unit slopeA1 in Shaw specimens (low ARM alteration; Supplementary Table 2), and by stable bulk susceptibility and successful pTRM checks in Thellier specimens (Supplementary Figure 4; Figs. 5k\u2013p).\nThe Grenville dyke was baked by the 532 Ma Chatham-Grenville stock and carries similar shallow paleomagnetic directions to those reported for the stock. As part of the host rock for the stock, the dyke cooled slowly at a rate determined by the stock and therefore carries a paleointensity obtained over a prolonged time-period, rather than a nearly instantaneous record that would normally be expected for a dyke. Using a simple thermal diffusion estimate, which assumes a rate of 10\u22126 m2\ns\u22121, and taking a range of stock sizes between 3 km (unit 1) and 10 km (units 1 & 2 emplaced together), we estimate the overall cooling period to be at least several tens of thousands of years (Biggin et al., 2013). The cooling time through the blocking temperature of the ChRM may be substantially less because of quenching effects associated with the margin, but is nevertheless likely to be several kyr.\nA cooling rate experiment (e.g., Morales et al., 2006) was carried out on 26 dyke specimens from the Thellier experiments. A mean difference of just +2% is recorded when comparing each total TRM from the fast (20 minutes) and slow cooling (24 hours) durations; when comparing only the successful specimens, this value is +1.3%. This approximates a 1% correction per order of magnitude difference in cooling rate. When scaled by the difference between the cooling rate estimated to have occurred in nature (\u223c10 kyr) and that of the laboratory, this becomes a correction factor of \u223c8%. These results suggest that the paleointensity values may slightly overestimate the field by up to 0.4 \u03bcT. We choose, however, to not apply such a small correction, and calculate a virtual dipole moment (VDM) from the site-level paleointensity (3.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcT) of 0.94 \u00b1 0.14 \u00d7 1022 Am2. All specimen results that pass selection criteria are equally weighted (PsT results are excluded; Table 2).\nSince the geomagnetic polarity reversal frequency may have been extremely high at the time these rocks cooled (see below), we cannot rule out that a polarity reversal took place during the cooling of the dyke. If this were the case, then the paleointensity may be unrepresentative of the long-term average by virtue of being biased low by weak transitional fields. We note, however, that the occurrence of a rapidly and strongly changing field is not supported by the directions revealed by stepwise demagnetisation in these samples.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for the geodynamo and paleomagnetic behaviour\nThese new data are considered alongside existing dipole moments for the time period 600\u2013250 Ma (Fig. 7\na); we use the most current version of the fully QPI scored Pint database (v.8.0.0; Bono et al., 2022), in addition to several \u2018post-Pint\u2019 data (Hawkins et al., 2021; Shcherbakova et al., 2020; Thallner et al., 2021a, 2021b). The data are filtered using QPI \u2265 3 and number of samples per site (N) \u2265 3. We also distinguish between data that have evidence of a primary TRM (QTRM; Fig. 7b). Interestingly, requiring QTRM removes many of the high values from the dataset, including the only other Cambrian result (Fig. 7b). We note that in both datasets, the variance of the estimates within any single time interval is comparable to the magnitude of any long-term trend. This is a characteristic feature of PINT, likely reflecting a combination of secular variation and measurement error. This does not, however, preclude the detection of intervals, exceeding 10 Myr in duration, with distinctly different average dipole moments (Hawkins et al., 2021; Kulakov et al., 2019).\nThe other paleointensity estimate from the Cambrian period yields a slightly higher VDM of 3.0 \u00d7 1022 Am2 at 522 \u00b1 13 Ma (McClelland and Briden, 1996). These data, from the Ntonya Ring Complex are affected by several factors; most specifically, laboratory alteration was described by the authors as massive, with failed pTRM checks that were subsequently corrected. Additionally, an extremely small fraction of remanence was used (1%) for the paleointensity estimate, and the potential for contamination from chemical remanent magnetization was acknowledged along with the presence of multidomain grains. The estimate is assigned a QPI score of 4 out of 10, which is higher than our applied general minimum (\u22653) and are therefore retained in our analysis; however, we would suggest that they are associated with large uncertainties.\nThe new data presented here pass all but one QPI criteria (QLITH), and we therefore regard the results as reliable. They present a similarly \u2018ultra-weak\u2019 dipole moment (0.9 \u00d7 1022 Am2) at 533 Ma to the Ediacaran dipole moment (0.7 \u00d7 1022 Am2) interpreted to be an indication of incipient ICN at 565 Ma (Bono et al., 2019). These measurements are recorded over a prolonged period of time and are considered to average paleosecular variation.\nThe extremely weak dipole at 532 Ma here coincides with a period of potential hyperactive reversal rates (>20 Myr\u22121) during the Tommotian and Atdabanian (Gallet et al., 2019). An additional period of similar, better-defined hyperactivity is also observed between \u223c500\u2013505 Ma before rates slow to \u223c1.5 Myr\u22121 towards the onset of the Moyero superchron at 486 Ma (Gallet et al., 2019). The characteristics of available paleomagnetic data during this time therefore support a new period of negative correlation between average dipole strength and reversal frequency, which is similarly observed for other prolonged periods of Earth history (Biggin et al., 2012). A recent study (Eid et al., 2022) highlights the absence of a clear negative correlation over the interval 0\u2013155 Ma using the world paleointensity database, although they speculate that this may be due to insufficient sampling rather than an intrinsic geomagnetic feature. Extending slightly further back in time, the relationship is supported by Kulakov et al. (2019) who analysed an updated version of the PINT database for 65\u2013200 Ma.\nThis negative correlation has aided statistical analyses of the paleomagnetic field in the pursuit of identifying long-term trends. Periodic weak-field observations that occur 10\u2013100 Myr prior to the onset of three Phanerozoic superchrons (e.g., Bono et al., 2019; Doubrovine et al., 2019; Hawkins et al., 2021, 2019; Shcherbakova et al., 2020, 2017; Thallner et al., 2021) are hypothesised to reflect part of a long-term (200 Myr) quasi-periodicity in dipole strength (Biggin et al., 2012). The timescale of quasi-periodicity has further been linked to mantle forcing through subduction flux (Hounslow et al., 2018).\nOur new result strengthens the hypothesis, although the stark lack of data for the 100 million years following our 532 Ma Chatham-Grenville result is also apparent. New paleointensity estimates from the early Paleozoic and, in particular, the Moyero reversed polarity superchron (467\u2013486 Ma), are required to test the hypothesis more thoroughly (Fig. 7).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe have produced a high-quality and precise paleointensity estimate using four different methods from the Cambrian period. The determination is from a \u223c590 Ma Grenville dyke that was baked and subsequently slow-cooled by the Chatham-Grenville stock at 532 Ma, recording the Cambrian paleomagnetic field strength over several thousands of years. The site produces an extremely weak VDM of 0.94 \u00b1 0.16 \u00d7 1022 Am2, which is similar to the ultra-weak Ediacaran results interpreted to be a sign of ICN age. These new data are coincidental with a potential period of reversal hyperactivity similar to the Ediacaran and may indicate that the same paleomagnetic behaviour persisted into the Cambrian. The data fit well with the hypothesis of an approximate 200 Myr quasi-periodicity in average dipole strength; however, the lack of paleointensity data for the early to mid-Paleozoic (\u223c540\u2013430 Ma) currently impedes any significant clarification of this hypothesis, or for any potential proxy paleointensity signal of ICN age.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nSimon J.

However, an assumed rigid lithosphere cannot explain the occurrence of massive active volcanoes away from plate boundaries. To explain intraplate volcanism, two classes of melt-generating mechanisms, mantle plumes (e.g., Morgan, 1971) and non-plume processes (i.e. tectonic plate processes, e.g., Anderson, 2000) have been proposed.\nThe discovery of the northwest-oriented lineament of the Hawaiian archipelago led to the birth of the mantle plume model (Morgan, 1971; Wilson, 1963). The mantle plume model proposes an upwelling of abnormally hot material that rises from the lowermost mantle in the form of narrow conduits and produces large volumes of volcanism on the surface (Coffin and Eldholm, 1994; Morgan, 1971; Sleep, 1990; Wilson, 1963). Seismic studies suggest that current active \u201chotspots\u201d (i.e. the proposed surface locations of active mantle plumes) usually appear above thinner mantle transition zones (Courtier et al., 2007) and the margins of Large Low-Shear-Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle (Lau et al., 2017; Torsvik et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2015). However, due to the difficulty of magma volume calculation, the quantity of magma brought by mantle plumes to the surface has not yet been assessed.\nIn order to explain the occurrence of magma away from hotspots, some volcanism has been attributed to lateral flow of plume material (Phipps Morgan et al., 1995; Sleep, 1997). Whilst of interest, this hypothesis is not easily testable and could potentially be used to explain any intraplate volcanism, in particular where information on local lithosphere thickness is absent. Given this, it is beyond the remit of the present paper to attempt further quantification of this potential effect.\nOther studies propose that shallow, non-plume processes cause widespread intraplate volcanism, such as intraplate lithospheric extension (Anderson, 2000; Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger and Natland, 2003), plate flexural deformation (Hieronymus and Bercovici, 1999), thermal contraction (Gans et al., 2003; Stuart et al., 2007), plate-boundary forces such as slab pull and ridge push (Hirano et al., 2006), sub-lithospheric processes generating upwelling flow via density heterogeneities (Ballmer et al., 2007; Bonatti and Harrison, 1976), and asthenospheric shearing coupled with viscosity heterogeneities (Conrad et al., 2011, 2010). These non-plume mechanisms challenge classic plate tectonic theory and the mantle plume model. It is debated whether deep mantle processes dynamically supply intraplate volcanism since it was proposed 50 years ago. We contribute to this debate by quantifying the conceivable relative importances of the two melt-generating mechanisms in a way that has not been attempted before.\nIn this paper we compare the geographic distribution of intraplate volcanism, both proposed and not proposed to have been produced by plumes. The Pacific plate is the best region for our study because it contains abundant seamounts far from the plate boundaries and is underlain by the largest LLSVP (Fig. 1\n). Three outcomes are possible, and have the following implications for mantle geodynamics:\n\n\u2022\nOutcome 1: Most seamount volume is attributed to mantle plumes implying that, within plate interiors, erupted melt volumes are consistent with whole-mantle convection bringing material up from the lower mantle.\n\n\n\u2022\nOutcome 2: Most seamount volume has not been attributed to mantle plumes implying that, within plate interiors, volcanism is dominated by upper-mantle convection driven by non-plume processes.\n\n\n\u2022\nOutcome 3: Roughly equal proportions are found for plume- and non-plume-related volcanism, supporting both processes making an approximately equal contribution to Pacific intraplate volcanism.\n\n\n\nA number of studies have mapped seamount locations and estimated their distributions globally (Craig and Sandwell, 1988; Kim and Wessel, 2011; Kitchingman et al., 2007; Wessel, 2001; Yesson et al., 2011). The database of Kim and Wessel (2011) models seamounts as ideal elliptical cones and includes ellipse major-axis, minor-axis and height in order to estimate seamount volume. However, the accuracy of estimated seamount volumes is highly influenced by how well idealized geometries represent observed seamounts, which can be highly irregular in shape (Zhao et al., 2020). Furthermore, the calculated volume can be seriously underestimated by thick sediment coverage obscuring a significant fraction of the seamount by blanketing its base (Wessel et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). Our study advances previous seamount volume estimates by (1) taking account of irregular seamount topography, and (2) correcting for the varying sediment thicknesses that obscure the bases of the seamounts.\nOne critical problem is to separate the seamounts proposed, and not proposed, to have been fed by plumes. Within the Pacific plate, different seamount chains have been attributed to plumes by different authors (Courtillot et al., 2003; Morgan and Morgan, 2007; Sleep, 1990; Torsvik et al., 2006). We categorize seamounts based on these previously published lists. For the main text, we use the list of Courtillot et al. (2003). We also study seamounts along the Pacific LLSVP margin to investigate seamount generation proposed to be linked to plumes guided by the LLSVP margins (Torsvik et al., 2006).\n\n\n2\nData and methods\n\n2.1\nData and general approach\nTo quantify seamount volume over the Pacific plate, we use the SRTM15+V2.0 global bathymetry grid (Tozer et al., 2019). Bathymetry is provided at a spatial sampling of 15 arcs (\u223c500 m) and is derived from a combination of satellite altimetry and multi-beam and single-beam shipboard measurements over selected areas. We first apply a white top-hat filter to the bathymetry data to isolate short-wavelength seamount topography above long-wavelength seafloor (Zhao et al., 2020). We validate the extracted seamount locations with the database of Kim and Wessel (2011). Subsequently, we apply large-scale Gaussian Process regression to the top-hat results to determine seamount structure above the seafloor in order to extrapolate structure beneath the sediment to the basaltic basement (i.e., the top of the oceanic crust) (Supplementary Figs. S1-S3). Local sediment thickness is extracted from GlobSed-V3 (Straume et al., 2019). Finally, we map the spatial distribution of seamount volume on the Pacific plate by calculating a volcanic equivalent layer thickness (VELT), and examine the relationship between volume and seafloor age (Seton et al., 2020). In the following, we further expand on the algorithmic details of each step of the workflow.\n\n\n2.2\nReconstruction of above-basement topography\nThe first step in our workflow is to isolate irregular seamount topography above the seafloor. To that end, we utilize a top-hat transform, which is an image processing technique that picks small elements from 1D signals and 2D images (Meyer, 1979). For example, for 2D images, the white top-hat function allows the extraction of peaks in a gray-tone image that are smaller than some reference structuring element (Matheron and Serra, 1988; Vogt and Del Valle, 1994). For digital elevation models (DEMs), this operation permits extraction of positive relief features with specific size and shape properties (Tripathi et al., 2000). Thereby, only the information for the higher elevation peaks with wavelengths smaller than the structuring element are kept. The white top-hat filter has been successfully applied to isolate seamount topography above the seafloor in the South China Sea while removing oceanic plateaus and fracture zone scarps (Zhao et al., 2020).\nThe next step in our workflow is to extrapolate the above-seafloor seamount topography to the depth of the basaltic basement, where basement depth is determined by local sediment thickness. This extrapolation is only performed on seamounts that have their bases partially obscured by sediment (i.e., not seamounts that are completely buried) since here we only use bathymetry data. To that end, we first apply a Gaussian Process (GP) regression to the above-sediment bathymetry as computed by the white top-hat transform. A GP represents a distribution over functions by approximating the distribution with a mean function and a covariance function. In this work, the distribution of functions of interest is the distribution of bathymetry, \nh\n(\nx\n)\n, above some reference plane (the basement) and throughout a spatial domain indexed by the coordinates x. For the purposes of introducing GPs, we assume that our analysis area is relatively narrow (e.g., tens of kilometers) such that the reference plane is constant throughout. The following discussion closely follows that of (Rasmussen, 2003). Our aim is to draw realistic samples of bathymetry from a GP approximation:\n\n(1)\n\nh\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\u223c\n\nGP\n\n\n(\nm\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n,\nk\n\n(\nx\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n where \nm\n(\nx\n)\n is the mean function and \nk\n(\nx\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n is the covariance function describing the covariance of bathymetry between points x and \n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n. More concretely, given vectors of length N of bathymetry and coordinates, \nh\n, \nx\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nN\n\n\n, we aim to construct an approximating Gaussian distribution:\n\n(2)\n\nh\n\u223c\nN\n\n(\nm\n,\n\nK\n)\n\n,\n\n\n where \nm\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nN\n\n\n is now the mean vector and \nK\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nN\n\u00d7\nN\n\n\n is the covariance matrix for a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Note, we adopt the vector notation as \n\n\nm\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\nm\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\n, \ni\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n, and \n\n\nK\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n=\nk\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n)\n, \ni\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n and \nj\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n. The covariance matrix \nK\n is thus constructed by evaluating the covariance function \nk\n(\nx\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n at unique combinations of the coordinates in \nx\n. There are a number of classes of covariance functions (also referred to as kernels) commonly used, and each has different characteristic roughness, shape, lengthscale, periodicity, etc. in order to model a diverse range of functions. Here, we use the radial basis function (RBF) kernel:\n\n(3)\n\nk\n\n(\nx\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n=\nA\ne\nx\np\n\n(\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n(\nx\n\u2212\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n which is described by the hyperparameters A and \u03c3, which are the amplitude and lengthscale, respectively, of the kernel. For our purposes, the kernel amplitude controls the amount of modeled vertical variation in bathymetry while the lengthscale controls its roughness. Note that the kernel has an \n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n dependency, which is consistent with the gravity-derived bathymetry that nominally follows Newton's law of gravity. The RBF kernel is thus the optimal kernel choice for modeling the statistics of the SRTM15+V2.0 bathymetry used in this work.\nTo formulate the prediction equations for the GPs, we first designate the vectors of the spatial coordinates, \nx\n, and above-seafloor topography, \nh\n, as the GP inputs and outputs, respectively. These vectors comprise the entire training data and are populated by the outputs of the white top-hat transform. Note that only above-seafloor topography over a certain threshold is included in the training data (see workflow at the end of this section). The inputs for prediction, i.e. the test data inputs, consist of the spatial coordinates, \n\n\nx\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nM\n\n\n, not included in the training data. Nominally, these coordinates correspond to regions where above-seafloor topography is below the height threshold used for the training data. Then, to predict bathymetry, \n\n\nh\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\u2208\n\n\nR\n\n\nM\n\n\n, at these coordinates, we use the joint distribution:\n\n(4)\n\n\n[\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\u223c\nN\n\n(\n\n[\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n,\n\n[\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\n\u204e\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n where we use the notation \n\n\nK\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n=\nk\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n)\n, \ni\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nN\n and \nj\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nM\n, and \n\n\nK\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\u204e\n\u204e\n\n\n=\nk\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n,\n\n\nx\n\n\nj\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n)\n, \ni\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nM\n and \nj\n=\n1\n,\n\u2026\n,\nM\n. Using standard rules for conditional Gaussians, we can then write the posterior predictive distribution from the joint distribution as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n|\nh\n\u223c\nN\n\n(\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n+\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\nT\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n(\nh\n\u2212\nm\n)\n\n,\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\n\u204e\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\nT\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, for given values of the kernel hyperparameters, the covariance matrices and vectors can be evaluated at the training and prediction coordinates in order to compute the posterior mean and covariance matrix for the bathymetry at the prediction coordinates.\nThe hyperparameter values can significantly influence the smoothness of the predicted bathymetry. We aim for a predictive distribution that does not overfit the training data and generalizes well to unseen prediction coordinates. To that end, we perform a non-linear optimization for the hyperparameters by maximizing the log marginal likelihood for the training data:\n\n(6)\n\nlog\n\u2061\np\n\n(\nh\n|\nx\n,\nA\n,\n\u03c3\n)\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\nlog\n\u2061\n\n|\nK\n|\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n(\nh\n\u2212\nm\n)\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n(\nh\n\u2212\nm\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\nN\n\n\n2\n\n\nl\no\ng\n\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe final key algorithmic choice involves the value of the mean function at the training and prediction coordinates. Here, we set the mean function to be zero at all coordinates. In addition to simplification of the above equations, this encourages the bathymetric predictions to trend towards zero away from the training data. Within our context of recovery of bathymetry covered by sediments, this design choice is mathematically equivalent to placing the basaltic basement as the reference plane (\nh\n=\n0\n), and the spatial pattern at which the predicted topography reaches that reference plane is informed by the covariance structure represented by the kernel and the optimized hyperparameters.\nIn order to scale this procedure to the entire Pacific plate, we divide the Pacific region into square tiles with side lengths of 6 degrees with a 0.5 degree overlap between each tile. For each tile, we independently implement the following workflow: (1) extract bathymetry from the SRTM15+V2.0 grid (Tozer et al., 2019); (2) apply a white top-hat filter (using a disk structuring element with a radius of 20 km) in order to isolate short-wavelength bathymetry from the long-wavelength seafloor; (3) add bias computed from a 2D bilinear ramp associated with the local sediment thickness, extracted from GlobSed-V3 (Straume et al., 2019); (4) construct GP training data by randomly selecting bathymetry points above a height-above-seafloor threshold (500 m); (5) perform GP hyperparameter optimization; and (6) predict bathymetry at all points within the tile. In step (2), the short-wavelength bathymetry values are referenced above the seafloor. Therefore, the purpose of step (3) is to bias the observed bathymetry to be above the basaltic basement, which is now the reference plane. Step (6) is the final prediction step where the below-sediment bathymetry is extrapolated using the optimized kernel hyperparameters, along with associated uncertainties computed from the diagonal of the posterior predictive covariance matrix. A more rigorous uncertainty analysis would likely incorporate uncertainties associated with the sediment thickness grid. Nevertheless, we can utilize the GP uncertainties as a qualitative check on the bathymetry predictions. Since the GP mean functions are set to zero, we limit spurious bathymetric predictions between seamounts that are separated by large distances within the tile.\nIn summary, we use a white top-hat filter to isolate irregular seamount topography from the seafloor and GP regression to extrapolate the base of the seamount that is partially obscured by sediment. These results are used to obtain the spatial distribution of above-basement seamount volume over the entire Pacific, thus permitting a comparison of the seamount volume between proposed plume and non-plume volcanism, as described in the next section.\n\n\n2.3\nQuantification of seamount volume distribution\nFollowing Conrad et al. (2017), we map the spatial distribution of seamount volume on the Pacific plate by calculating a volcanic equivalent layer thickness (VELT) using a moving window of \n300\n\u00d7\n300\n km (Fig. 2\n). For computing the VELT grid for the entire Pacific region we assemble the tile predictions of predicted bathymetry above the basement and average the values in the overlap regions to minimize tile boundary artifacts. We use an identical procedure for assembling the VELT uncertainty grid where uncertainties are computed with simple propagation of uncertainties of the bathymetric values.\nTo further assess the spatial distribution of seamount volume, we examine the relationship between volume and seafloor age (Seton et al., 2020). Seafloor age increases with distance from the spreading center (Supplementary Fig. S4), thus providing a convenient context to compare spatial and temporal distributions of seamount volume. We divide our VELT grids into bins of equal age (\u223c4 Ma) and compute a mean VELT, \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n, for each age bin:\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nVELT\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\n,\n\n\n where VELTi is the VELT value for i-th grid cell, and N is the total number of grid cells for the given age bin.\n\n\n\n3\nSeamount volume distribution on the Pacific plate\n\n3.1\nSpatial distribution of seamount volume\nThe greatest volcanic volumes are located in the western Pacific, where VELT can reach up to 700 m on the old oceanic crust (Figs. 2A and 2B). The asymmetric distribution of VELT between the eastern and western Pacific is consistent with earlier findings that the largest seamounts lie on the oldest crust (Conrad et al., 2017; Kim and Wessel, 2011; Wessel, 1997) (Fig. 2C). Comparison of VELT above the seafloor with VELT above the basaltic basement (i.e., adding volume buried by sediment) shows that the largest corrections for sediment cover occur for the areas with larger VELT in general (Fig. 2D). This trend is consistent with a straightforward geometric reasoning that larger seamounts will have larger absolute volumes covered by sediment. Areas with thick VELT are mainly along the large seamount chains with various ages of activity, including currently active seamounts (Fig. 2E). High values of VELT are associated both with chains attributed to plumes (e.g., Hawaii and Samoa) and to non-plume processes (e.g., the Tokelau chain, the Gilbert chain, the Line islands and scattered seamounts on the oldest crust) (Courtillot et al., 2003) (Fig. 2E). After removing seamounts classified as plume-related by Courtillot et al. (2003) and re-computing VELT, we find that the change in the spatial distribution of VELT is minor\u2013the old seafloor in the western Pacific still has the greatest volume of intraplate volcanism (Fig. 2F).\nSince the bathymetric grid (SRTM15+V2.0) is constructed using a combination of satellite gravity and ship soundings (Tozer et al., 2019), uncertainty is introduced. One source of uncertainty comes from deriving bathymetry from satellite gravity. Satellite-derived bathymetry is limited by the wavelength band resolvable and small seamounts are not resolved (Smith and Sandwell, 1997; Tozer et al., 2019). We constructed a synthetic grid and confirm that, if any, those potentially unresolved small seamounts (height < 1000 m) are unimportant in the quantification of seamount volume distribution for the Pacific (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, there are misfits between shipboard measurements and satellite-derived bathymetry. For seamounts, the misfits are highly correlated and can be explained to a significant degree by the gravity effect of uncompensated bathymetry (Watts et al., 2020). Uncertainty analysis described in the supplement suggests that when the RMS error of the seamount height is < 500 m, the misfits have a minimal effect on the VELT distribution result (Supplementary Fig. S6). We thus conclude that the distribution of volcanism we calculate based on SRTM15+V2.0 (RMS of \u00b1180 m, Tozer et al., 2019) is reliable.\n\n\n3.2\nIntraplate volcanism vs. crustal age\nConsistent with the map view of the VELT distribution (Fig. 2), the relationship between volume and seafloor age shows that larger volcanic volumes concentrate in older crust (Fig. 3\nA). Two prominent peaks occur at seafloor ages of \u223c120 Ma and >\u223c160 Ma. The peak around \u223c120 Ma corresponds to the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, most of which lies within the Cretaceous magnetic quiet zone (84-124 Ma), the Line islands (emplacement ages of 70-100 Ma) and the Samoan seamounts (emplacement ages of <43 Ma) (Fig. 2E). The other peak at >\u223c160 Ma (Fig. 3A) corresponds to scattered seamounts emplaced at 70-100 Ma (Fig. 2E). From the difference between the crustal and emplacement ages, it can be seen that most of these large seamounts formed on lithosphere that was, at the time of eruption, older than 20 Myr in both near-ridge and off-ridge settings (Watts et al., 1980).\n\n\n3.3\nVolume bias analysis\nIn order to compare our VELT results to prior work on seamount volume quantification, we also compute \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n using the elliptical cone model from the database of Kim and Wessel (2011) (Fig. 3A). We confirm that this yields a total seamount volume vs. seafloor age trend very consistent with our total VELT vs. seafloor age results (Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n computed using the cone model is underestimated by 75% (Figs. 3A and 3B) as a result of neglecting irregular shape and sediment blanketing.\nIrregular seamount shapes and densely clustered seamount groups in particular cause large biases in computed volume using idealized cone shapes. The proportion of volume exposed above the sediment layer (the ratio of volume above the seafloor to volume above the basaltic basement) mainly falls in the range 60%-85% of total volcanic volume (Fig. 3C). There is a generally negative correlation between exposed VELT proportion and sediment thickness (Fig. 3C). Sediment coverage is a significant confounding factor for quantifying seamount volume.\nA bias of 75% is significantly larger than previously reported (Kim and Wessel, 2011). The larger standard deviation (\u03c3) we obtained for \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n for seafloor ages >80 Ma (Fig. 3A) is a reflection of the wide range of seamount sizes in the mid-aged and old Pacific.\nA striking increase in \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n occurs for seafloor ages >140 Ma (Fig. 3A). However, total VELT or total volcanic volume in this age range is low for the oldest Pacific seafloor (Supplementary Fig. S7A) because it is relatively small in area\u2013a large part of Jurassic Pacific seafloor has been subducted. While it is impossible to estimate the subducted Mesozoic seamount volume, we use \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n as our comparison metric (as opposed to total volume) to partially account for varying areas within observable seafloor age ranges.\n\n\n\n4\nMantle plume influence\n\n4.1\nPlume-attributed volcanism distribution\nTo investigate the contribution of seamounts proposed to arise from mantle plumes, we divide the seamounts into four categories (Table 1\n). For each category, we compute \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n vs. seafloor age (Fig. 4\n) and the frequency distribution (i.e., histogram) (Fig. 5\n). First, we compare the chronological distributions of the erupted volumes produced by all seamounts in the Pacific plate (Cat. 1), seamounts not attributed to plumes (Cat. 2), and seamounts that are attributed to plumes (Cat. 3). There is great disagreement among authors concerning which volcanoes are produced by plumes and which are not (Courtillot et al., 2003; Morgan and Morgan, 2007; Sleep, 1990; Torsvik et al., 2006). In this discussion, we use the list of Courtillot et al. (2003) and include their \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d plumes in Cat. 3 (i.e., 10 plumes). We found that the choice of plume list had little influence on the overall results (Tables 2\n and S1, Figs. 4D and S9). VELT is plotted against seafloor age in Fig. 4A and cumulative total volume is shown in Fig. 4B.\nThe first three \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n categories vary synchronously where seafloor age is <140 Ma and show a striking peak at 120 Ma and a minor peak at 90 Ma (Fig. 4A). This tight correlation indicates that the three categories of volcanism have had similar distributions since the Cretaceous. In the oldest oceanic crust (>140 Ma), \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n for Cat. 1 and Cat. 2 is greatest while Cat. 3 has very low \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n (Fig. 4A). This shows that plume-related volcanism is predicted to account for only a very small fraction of the intraplate volcanism in the older part of the Pacific plate. The plot of cumulative VELT across the entire Pacific (Fig. 4B) further illustrates this point by showing proposed plume volcanism (Cat. 3) only accounts for 18% of the total (Cat. 1). Moreover, plume-attributed products cannot be distinguished from the rest on the basis of frequency distribution of individual seamount volumes (Figs. 5 and S8). The products attributed to plumes and those attributed to non-plume processes essentially form a single statistical population.\n\n\n4.2\nVolcanism distribution above LLSVP margins\nThe LLSVPs have been proposed to be relatively long-lived, dense bodies in the lower mantle (Lay, 2005). Torsvik et al. (2008) proposed that deep mantle plumes rise from their boundaries, citing as evidence a spatial correlation with large igneous provinces (Bower et al., 2013; Davies et al., 2012; McNamara and Zhong, 2005; Zhang et al., 2010). Old plume products may have been transported away from the LLSVP margin, but our computations show that no recently active hotspot exists above the current LLSVP margin in the oldest seafloor. Here, we compare seamount volcanism above a 1000-km-wide band forming the LLSVP boundary (Cat. 4) and the volume of all seamounts in the Pacific (Cat. 1) (Fig. 4A). The chosen LLSVP boundary corresponds to the seismic velocity anomaly of \u22121% dln (Vs) in the SMEAN model at 2800 km depth (Becker and Boschi, 2002). In the mid-aged Pacific plate, \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n for Cat. 4 changes synchronously with the other three categories with peaks at 90 Ma and 120 Ma. Using different widths for the LLSVP margin gives similar results (Supplementary Fig. S9).\nIn contrast to the results for plume-related volcanism (Cat. 3), seamounts above the LLSVP margin are highly concentrated in old seafloor with a constant increase of \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n for ages >150 Ma (Fig. 4A). In the oldest seafloor (>170 Ma), almost all of the seamounts are located above the LLSVP margin (\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n of Cat. 4 overlaps \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n of Cat. 1), which is simply because a large proportion of the old oceanic crust is within our LLSVP margin (Fig. 4C). However, these large values of \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n are not associated with proposed plumes (i.e., \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n of Cat. 3 stays low), indicating that intraplate volcanism above the current LLSVP margin in the oldest seafloor is mainly sourced by non-plume processes.\nThe LLSVP margin includes a progressively larger area of the seafloor as it youngs from \u223c20 Ma to 0 Ma (increasing from \n0.8\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n km2 to \n1.2\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n km2, Fig. 4C) while the contribution to the total volume of intraplate volcanism made by seamounts on young seafloor stays low. Moreover, there is no intraplate plume in any lists above the LLSVP margin for seafloor < 20 Ma (Fig. 4E). It is generally assumed (though not proven) that the Pacific LLSVP has been stationary relative to the spin axis of the Earth during the past 300 Myr (Torsvik et al., 2008). If this is correct, our results show that, in the last \u223c20 Ma, intraplate volcanism in the young crust above the LLSVP margin is mostly contributed by non-plume-related seamounts.\n\n\n4.3\nVolcanism volumes for different plume lists\nWe also compute plume-related VELT using other lists for the Pacific (Figs. 4D and 4E, Table 2), i.e., nine (Cat. 3 excluding Hawaii), and four (Torsvik et al., 2006). For tests using more lists, see the supplement where we present results for twelve plumes (Morgan and Morgan, 2007) and two \u201cprimary\u201d plumes\u2013the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville seamount chains\u2013considered by Courtillot et al. (2003) to originate from the core-mantle boundary (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. S8). Notably, the \u201chotspotting\u201d technique (Wessel and Kroenke, 1997) is effective to map out the potential plume-like upwelling seamounts. The list of hotspots suggested by \u201chotspotting\u201d method (Wessel et al., 2006) adds three more \u201chotspots\u201d to the list of Morgan and Morgan (2007) (Supplementary Table S1). However, these additional \u201chotspots\u201d are likely formed by short-lived and discontinuous intraplate volcanism originating at very shallow mantle depths, which is suggested to be built by regional plate extension (Ito et al., 1995; Koppers and Staudigel, 2005). Therefore, these additional seamount chains are not included in the hotspot category.\nUsing different plume lists to compute both \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n (Fig. 4D) and the probability density distribution of the plume-related VELT (Supplementary Figs. S8A-S8D) gives very similar results. Overall, \n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u203e\n\n shows that proposed plume-related seamounts are mainly concentrated on mid-aged seafloor (90-120 Ma) except for the seamount volume distribution that excludes Hawaii (Figs. 4D and SE). That is to say, only the Hawaiian seamount chain includes seamounts that produce large enough volumes to significantly change the distribution of proposed-plume-related volcanism in the Pacific plate. Thus, in this respect, proposed-plume volcanism volume in the Pacific plate is heavily dependent on Hawaii alone.\n\n\n4.4\nSeamount volume histograms\nA histogram of individual seamount volumes, based on the database of Kim and Wessel (2011), further distinguishes different kinds of intraplate volcanism (Fig. 5A). The seamounts are divided into those excluding plumes (Cat. 2), those attributed to plumes (Cat. 3), and those above the LLSVP margin (Cat. 4). All three categories show similar exponential distributions for seamount volumes smaller than 15000 km3 (Fig. 5A). Four outliers have volumes >15000 km3. Among them, three belong to the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The other outlier, the SIO Guyot, lies on the westernmost edge of the Mid-Pacific mountains (Nemoto and Kroenke, 1985) (Fig. 5B), which is not considered to be plume-fed (Clouard and Bonneville, 2001; Courtillot et al., 2003). SIO Guyot is an exceptionally large seamount built by non-plume processes. Its large volume, \u223c18000 km3, offers some indication of the seamount volumes that researchers accept can be produced without the involvement of mantle plumes.\nThe spatial density of the VELT grids allows for well-formed histograms that exhibit approximately exponential probability densities for all categories. We further apply a kernel density estimation smoothing operator to the histogram bins to obtain continuous probability curves while maintaining relevant frequency variations (Fig. 5C). Consistent with Fig. 5A, all the probability curves are similar for values of VELT < 900 m. When VELT > 900 m, the curve for Cat. 3 is higher than the other three categories, indicating more large seamounts in the plume category compared with the others. When VELT > 1250 m, the curves of Cats. 3 and 4 are very similar and both are systematically higher than Cats. 1 and 2. This confirms that these large seamounts are systematically interpreted as plume-related. As discussed above (Figs. 4D and 5A), the majority belong to the Hawaiian-Emperor system. Except for these exceptionally large seamounts, in general, the similarity of the probability density curves suggests that on the Pacific plate intraplate volcanism considered to be related to plumes does not have a volume distribution that is significantly different from non-plume volcanism.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe spatial distribution of VELT expresses the supply of melt to Earth's surface. Our results show volcanism proposed to be plume-associated (including both \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d plumes) only contributes 18% of the volume of total intraplate volcanism (Fig. 4B). Of all proposed plumes in the Pacific plate, Courtillot et al. (2003) consider only Hawaii and Louisville to originate from the lowermost mantle. Other studies have contested this and reject the plume hypothesis entirely (Anderson et al., 2014). Our estimated plume VELT represents an upper bound of the erupted volume attributed to the most widely accepted plumes.\nAlthough different authors have proposed many different plume lists (e.g., Morgan and Morgan, 2007; Torsvik et al., 2006), the volume budget is dominated by the Emperor-Hawaiian system and the inclusion of smaller features does not significantly change the above findings (Figs. 4D and SE). The interaction between mantle plumes and mid-ocean ridges is proposed to have generated massive volumes of melts that is preserved as oceanic plateaus (Madrigal et al., 2016; Taylor, 2006). We manually extracted the bathymetry associated with oceanic plateaus based on the polygons of Madrigal et al. (2016) and computed the VELT contribution (Supplementary Fig. S10). Even considering all of them to be plume-generated, the maximum proportion of plume-related VELT (including ten plume-related seamount chains and oceanic plateaus) is still less than 50% of the total intraplate volcanism.\nWe also considered an extreme scenario where the oceanic crust is thickened at the base of the plume-related seamounts due to magmatic underplating (Watts and Ten Brink, 1989) but not under non-plume seamounts. For the few seamounts with well-defined crustal structures, the ratios between the volume of intra-crustal magmatic intrusions and extrusive volcanism are 10%-30% (Hawaiian volcanoes; Flinders et al., 2013), \u223c40% (Hawaii seamount chain; Watts and Ten Brink, 1989), or 53.2% (Louisville seamount chain; Contreras-Reyes et al., 2010). Assuming an end-member scenario where all proposed plume-related seamounts have large intrusive bodies and no non-plume-related ones do, we recompute the VELT distribution by simply multiplying the plume-related VELT by 140% (Supplementary Fig. S11). Results show these intrusive volumes have minor implications for the overall spatial distribution of mean VELT. As for the total volume of seamount volcanism, the fraction of intraplate volcanism from plumes increases from 18% (excluding intrusive bodies) to 23.5% (including intrusive bodies). Therefore, while plumes are proposed to have produced most of the oceanic plateaus and large-sized seamounts, these do not account for the majority of the total observable intraplate volcanism of the Pacific plate.\nSimilar work by Conrad et al. (2017) proposed that intraplate volcanism is sourced from asthenospheric melts while some local areas with higher volcanism, such as the older Pacific, might require additional melts from the deep mantle. Our accurate mapping of seamount volcanism further clarifies that these postulated additional melts from the deep mantle account for at most 18% of total intraplate volcanism in the Pacific plate. Our results therefore indicate that plume processes do not dominate the intraplate volcanism, the majority of which is likely related to non-plume processes.\nThe method we used can be expanded to other oceans. Sediment thickness varies more in other oceans (e.g., in the Atlantic, sediment cover ranges from 0 to >1 km; Straume et al., 2019), implying that volcanism has been even more underestimated in these areas. It would also be interesting to perform similar studies for the continents. In this way, investigation into the source of intraplate volcanic activity on Earth can advance.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nY.Z. devised the project, conducted the computation and analyses, and wrote the original manuscript; B.R. developed the computational framework, performed the numerical calculations, improved writing and wrote the methodology section; G.R. edited the manuscript, provided critical feedback, improved writing and data visualization; W.D. led the funding acquisition, jointly discussed the results and provided suggestions for further improvement of the figures and writing.

Salt giants have formed only episodically in Earth history, typically as a consequence of the tectonic restriction (opening or closing) of the connection between the global ocean and a mid-latitude marginal marine basin (Warren, 2016). Model experiments simulate the atmospheric CO2 and temperature consequences of evaporite deposition and weathering events assuming a constant oceanic supply of Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n ions to the marginal basins, or a constant riverine Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n flux from continental weathering, both lasting an estimated 1 million years (Shields and Mills, 2020). The heterogenous geological record of these salt giants, however, suggests that the ocean-marginal basin connectivity must have varied considerably (Warren, 2016), impacting the duration and intensity of ion fluxes in relation to evaporite precipitation and weathering during the formation of a salt giant. Reconstructing, the nature and timing of that variable connectivity, its relationship with gypsum precipitation and base-level changes is a critical step in quantifying the importance of this mechanism in driving carbon cycle change.\nThe most recent of the Earth's salt giants accumulated in the Mediterranean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC; 5.97\u20135.332 Ma). This formed as a consequence of Late Miocene tectonic uplift of the Gibraltar region which restricted marine exchange between the Mediterranean Basin and the Atlantic Ocean (e.g. Krijgsman et al., 2018). The Mediterranean's environmental response was dramatic, resulting in the precipitation of >1 million km3 of evaporites (e.g. Roveri et al., 2014a). Three evaporitic episodes with different connectivity configurations have been distinguished (Roveri et al., 2014a): Stage 1, dominated by gypsum-marl couplets which are thought to have been deposited during restricted two-way Atlantic-Mediterranean exchange (e.g. Reghizzi et al., 2018); Stage 2 comprises an up to 2 km thick halite layer resulting from Atlantic inflow but no Mediterranean outflow (e.g. Krijgsman et al., 2018); and Stage 3 in which gypsum alternates with brackish-water, ostracod-bearing marls where the connectivity scenario is controversial (Andreetto et al., 2021a). It has proved difficult to explain both the outcrop data, which mostly suggest a relatively full Mediterranean, and evidence from deep-sea cores and seismics, which suggest low water conditions (see Andreetto et al., 2021a for summary). These different base level reconstructions have implications for Atlantic-Mediterranean connectivity at the end of the MSC and its impact on ocean chemistry.\nPrevious attempts to reconstruct Mediterranean hydrology, paleoenvironments and connectivity during Stage 3 have involved 87Sr\/86Sr (M\u00fcller et al., 1990; Roveri et al., 2014b; Garc\u00eda-Veigas et al., 2018) because water sources of different origin (i.e. ocean, lakes, rivers, groundwater) have distinct 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (e.g. Reghizzi et al., 2018; Andreetto et al., 2021b, 2022; Bista et al., 2021). A solely geochemical approach to Stage 3 has proved inconclusive however, because more than one combination of potential source waters can result in the same geochemical signal. In this multi-proxy study, we combine new and existing sedimentological and paleontological observations with 87Sr\/86Sr analyses on selenite gypsum crystals and ostracod valves from the Eraclea Minoa section (Caltanissetta Basin, Sicily; Fig. 1\n).\nEraclea Minoa is the most complete sedimentary record of Stage 3 exposed on land and previous works have described evidence of both Atlantic and Eastern Paratethys influence (Grossi et al., 2015; Vasiliev et al., 2017; Garc\u00eda-Veigas et al., 2018). The succession shows strong precessional cyclicity from which an astronomical age model has been derived (van der Laan et al., 2006; Manzi et al., 2009). Unlike age-equivalent marginal exposures, which are dominated by continental clastics, the Caltanissetta Basin was, during Stage 3, at intermediate depths (500-1500 mbsl) and accumulated both gypsum and ostracod-bearing marls, allowing the Sr isotopic characterization of both lithological elements. This dataset allows us to reconstruct Stage 3 connectivity and consider its impact on Late Miocene ocean biogeochemistry and climate.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\nThe Eraclea Minoa section (37\u00b023'36\u201dN, 13\u00b017'10.38\u201dE) is \u223c223 m-thick and comprises seven gypsum-marl alternations (Fig. 2\n). This Upper Gypsum succession is overlain sequentially by the Arenazzolo Fm., a \u223c6-7 m-thick fine to medium-grained sandstone, and the Pliocene Trubi marls (Fig. 2). Field work to log and sample the Eraclea Minoa section was undertaken in Spring 2001 and September 2020 and 2021.\nSelenitic gypsum can preserve biomineralized structures (Pellegrino et al., 2021), so twenty selenite crystals were selected from gypsums II to VII for micropaleontological screening. Crystals were cleaned of surface dirt using a brush and MilliQ purified water, sliced with a cleaned box cutter into 1-2 mm-thick splits and qualitatively analyzed, prior to carbon-coating the slices. Samples were then analyzed at the Electron Microscopy Centre at Utrecht University using a JEOL Neoscope II JCM-6000 table-top SEM equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Probe Microanalyser JEOL JXA 8530F.\nWe expanded the available ostracod and gypsum 87Sr\/86Sr dataset at Eraclea Minoa (Grossi et al., 2015; Garc\u00eda-Veigas et al., 2018) with 43 additional isotopic ratios on gypsums (39) and Cyprideis agrigentina valves from cycle 3 (4). Sample preparation and data acquisition followed standard procedures for gypsum (Reghizzi et al., 2018) and ostracods (Bista et al., 2021; Andreetto et al., 2022). The more vitreous selenites and balatino gypsum chips were mechanically isolated, washed with MilliQ-water and micromilled with a hand drill avoiding impurities trapped within crystals. 10 mg of gypsum powder was digested in 1M ammonium acetate, centrifuged with MilliQ-water, dried overnight at 120 \u00b0C on a hot plate, redissolved in 3M HNO3, centrifuged and refluxed on the hot plate. 6-7 adult valves of C. agrigentina were hand-picked under an optical microscope, repeatedly rinsed with MilliQ-water and methanol to remove potential contaminants (clay particles and organic material), dissolved in 300 \u03bcl of 0.1 M of HNO3 and dried at 120 \u00b0C. Strontium of all samples was isolated using 100 \u03bcl of pre-cleaned Sr-Spec resin and loaded onto rhenium filaments with a TaCl5 activator solution. 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from gypsums V and VI were measured in SUERC (University of Glasgow) on a VG Sector 54-30 mass spectrometer in dynamic multi-collection mode. Instrumental mass fractionation was corrected using an exponential law and 86Sr\/88Sr=0.1194. NIST SRM987 values over the period the measurements were carried out were: 87Sr\/86Sr =0.710251T20 (2cS.D.), n=95. 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from the ostracods and gypsums I-IV and VII were measured at the Bristol Isotope Group Facilities (University of Bristol) on a Thermo-Finnigan Triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer using a multi-dynamic \u2018triple jump\u2019 method. The average 87Sr\/86Sr is based on 200 ratios. The mean 87Sr\/86Sr values of nine NIST SRM 987 analyzed during this session was 0.710245\u00b10.000006267 and that of four NIST SRM 987 which have undergone chemical purification (mean 0.710268\u00b10.0000236925) are in good agreement with the accepted values of SRM 987 of 0.710250.\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nSedimentological description of a typical UG cycle\n\nManzi et al. (2009) described three repeated facies associations of the Upper Gypsum at Eraclea Minoa: two distinct gypsum-dominated facies associations (B and C) and a single gypsum-free facies association (A). On the basis of more detailed lithological and faunal analysis, we divide their facies association A into two sub-units A and D.\nOur sub-unit A, arbitrarily chosen as the base of the lithological cycle, comprises cm- to dm-thick beds of greenish, homogeneous marls interbedded with white laminated diatomites (Figs. 3\nc-d). This sub-unit, typically 1-2 meters thick, occurs immediately beneath the gypsum-bearing sequence (Figs. 2, 3b-c). Sub-unit D, at the top of the cycle, is found directly above the gypsum and consists of gray marls intercalated with cm- to dm-thick siltstones and litharenites (Figs. 2, 3h). The gypsum layers at Eraclea Minoa typically start with cm- to dm-thick beds of laminar (or balatino) and clastic gypsum (gypsarenites) alternating with greenish homogeneous marls (sub-unit B; Figs. 3c, e) and show a sharp change to rhythmic alternations of dm-thick layers of massive selenite and mm- to cm-thick greenish marls (sub-unit C; Fig. 3f). The balatino gypsum comprises alternating mm-thick gypsum cumulate layers with clay-rich horizons only a few hundreds of microns thick (Fig. 3e). The gypsarenites are commonly massive (Fig. 3e) with occasional sedimentary structures such as normal grading and horizontal lamination (Manzi et al., 2009). The selenite beds comprise bottom-grown, swallow-tail gypsum crystals (or selenites) oriented with the re-entrant angle of the twins upward (Fig. 3f). Crystal size is relatively uniform in individual beds, but increases vertically through sub-unit C, from cm-scale crystals at the base to several dm in length at the top. The geometry of the gypsum beds also changes upwards, from tabular (Fig. 3f) to domal or cauliflower-shaped (Fig. 3b). The resulting irregular upper surface (Fig. 3b) led some authors to interpret an episode of subaerial erosion (e.g. Rouchy and Caruso, 2006; Raad et al., 2021). However, no karstic features are observed in the Eraclea Minoa gypsums (see also Manzi et al., 2009).\nAt Eraclea Minoa, cycles 5, 6 and 7 all show a consistent facies sequence from the diatomite-bearing sub-unit A, through the cumulate and clastic gypsum sub-unit B, selenite-dominated sub-unit C, to the ostracod-bearing marls of sub-unit D (Fig. 2). Cycles 3 and 4 comprise sub-units B-D without the diatomaceous sub-unit A. Cycles 1 and 2 are poorly exposed with only sub-unit B visible in cycle 1 and C and D in cycle 2 and 3 (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2\nMicropaleontology\n\n3.2.1\nOstracods in sub-unit D marls\nSub-unit D marls contain 25 ostracod species (Grossi et al., 2015). One of these, C. agrigentina, is of Mediterranean origin (Grossi et al., 2015). All the others are endemic to Paratethys (Fig. 2; Stoica et al., 2016). The absence of Paratethyan ostracods in Mediterranean sediments prior to MSC Stage 3 and the occurrence here of well-preserved valves of different moult stages indicate that these ostracods are in situ (Grossi et al., 2015). In cycles 3, 6 and 7 there is a clear increase in ostracod diversity through sub-unit D from almost (cycle 7) or completely (cycle 3 and 6) monospecific assemblages of C. agrigentina (Biofacies 1) at the base to diverse communities of Paratethyan taxa (Biofacies 2) at the top (Fig. 2; Grossi et al., 2015). Planktic and benthic foraminifera have also been reported from sub-unit D's marls (Caruso and Rouchy, 2006). However, only Ammonia tepida, which like C. agrigentina dwells in euryhaline and shallow-water, is considered to be in-situ (Grossi et al., 2015). One of the three samples from a marl layer interbedded with selenites (sub-unit C) also contained valves of C. agrigentina and Loxoconcha muelleri (Fig. 2; Grossi et al., 2015). Analysis of a small number of marl samples from sub-unit A suggests that these sediments contain no ostracods (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3.2.2\nCalcareous nannofossils in selenitic gypsum\nThe Eraclea Minoa selenites display alternating turbid\/dark and transparent laminae (Fig. 4\na). SEM inspection of samples from layers II-VII reveals that the dark color is associated with abundant, closely packed calcareous nannofossils associated with a small detrital component, mostly clay and rare silt- and clay-sized euhedral halite crystals (Fig. 4b), which might result from drying out of fluid inclusions. Since the analyzed samples are slices of selenite crystals, we can confirm that these are microfossils embedded within the gypsum (Figs. 4b-d). Well preserved calcareous nannofossils comprising pristine platelets and intact coccospheres (Fig. 4e) are observed both in cavities (Figs. 4b-c, e-f) and within the undamaged parts of the crystals (Fig. 4d). Poorly preserved specimens including fragments and intact platelets with the central area missing are preferentially found in the cavities (Figs. 4b-c, f). However, the preservation of fine details on the platelets allows species-level identification. Reticulofenestra minuta is by far the most abundant taxon forming dominant or monospecific assemblages (Figs. 4b-d). Rare specimens of Reticulofenestra haqii, Reticulofenestra antarctica, Calcidiscus leptoporus, Coccolithus pelagicus, Helicosphaera carteri, Sphenolithus abies, Umbilicosphaera jafari and Chiasmolithus sp. are also observed (Fig. 4f). All taxa with the exception of Chiasmolithus sp., which went extinct in the Chattian, have chronostratigraphic ranges that overlap with Stage 3.\n\n\n\n3.3\nSr\/86Sr results\nGypsum samples are characterized by a narrow range of 87Sr\/86Sr (0.708704-0.708813; Table 1\n, Fig. 2). These data are substantially lower than 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of coeval seawater (\u223c0.709022; McArthur et al., 2012) and consistent with published 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from Eraclea Minoa (Garc\u00eda-Veigas et al., 2018) and from selenites of the Siculiana Marina section (0.708700\u20130.708760; Keogh and Butler, 1999), \u223c20 km to the SE (Fig. 1). Gypsum data from individual gypsum beds are either constant (II) or they show small-scale variability, commonly a decline from bottom to top (I, III\u2013VII). There is also a small, but analytically resolvable decrease in 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from the bottom of the section (Gypsum I) to the top (Gypsum VII).\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr range of sub-unit D's ostracods is substantially larger than the gypsum (0.708510\u20130.708827; Fig. 2). Four of these samples (three in cycle 3 and one in cycle 7) have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios higher or equivalent to the range of the gypsums; the remaining 25 have ratios lower than the gypsums. In the lowermost 52 m of sub-unit D of Cycle 6, which has the highest sampling resolution, fluctuations in 87Sr\/86Sr are both high frequency and high-amplitude.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nCoccoliths in gypsums\nThe presence of marine calcareous nannofossils within the Eraclea Minoa UG selenites indicates that they were settling out from suspension while gypsum was growing on the basin floor. Fragmented, poorly preserved platelets with an empty central area are present, indicating that some degree of physical reworking took place. The single occurrence of Chiasmolithus sp. corroborates this. However, fragmented platelets are preferentially found in large, irregularly-shaped cavities (Figs. 4b-c). When pristine areas of the gypsum slices (Fig. 4d) or small cracks (Fig. 4e) are inspected, preservation is better and complete coccospheres are observed. These delicate structures do not typically withstand erosion and transport intact. Other observations that are difficult to reconcile with an entirely reworked origin include the scarcity of terrigenous particles, the absence of bioclasts other than coccoliths and the limited diversity of these assemblages, which are solely or largely dominated by R. minuta (Figs. 4b, c-d). The absence of other marine organisms is indicative of a stressed environment in which only a few species could thrive. Interestingly, the dominant species, R. minuta, is regarded as an opportunistic taxon capable of inhabiting a wide range of salinity conditions, from brackish to hypersaline (Auer et al., 2014). Taken together, these data suggest that while minor reworking occurred, at least R. minuta, which is abundant, thrived in the Caltanissetta Basin during selenite precipitation. Being that R. minuta is of a marine origin, its finding in the Stage 3 selenites of Eraclea Minoa indicates that the Caltanissetta Basin was, at least during the evaporitic phases, supplied with Atlantic seawater. The seawater-like \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nSSO4 signature of the gypsums is consistent with the nannofossil-based conclusion (Fig. 2; Manzi et al., 2009; Garc\u00eda-Veigas et al., 2018).\nMonospecific assemblages of dwarfed nannofossils, identified as likely belonging to the genus Reticulofenestra, have also been described from the thin calcareous laminae of the balatino lithofacies in ODP Site 653B (Tyrrhenian Basin; Pierre and Rouchy, 1990) and in the Montedoro section (Rouchy and Caruso, 2006), located some 50 km to the NE of Eraclea Minoa, and from the balatino lithofacies in ODP Site 968A (Eratosthenes Seamount; Blanc-Valleron et al., 1998), where again they are embedded within the gypsum crystals themselves. These findings in gypsums from intermediate-deep settings to the east and west of the Caltanissetta Basin suggest that the Stage 3 gypsum subbasins of the Mediterranean may have been, at least during the evaporitic phases, part of a single, Atlantic-fed water body (which we refer to as \u201cLago-Mare\u201d; see next section) typified by stressful environmental conditions (Fig. 6). The Western Albor\u00e1n, Adriatic and North Aegean basins, which are Stage 3 gypsum-free, are likely to have been sealed off from the gypsum-forming Lago-Mare water mass due to the presence of dividing sills and to have maintained, for at least part of Stage 3, different water masses subject to independent base-level and hydrologic evolution (Fig. 6). Studies of the sedimentary and paleontological records of these basins support this conclusion (Pellen et al., 2017; Booth-Rea et al., 2018; Krijgsman et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.2\n\n87Sr\/86Sr characterization of the \u201cLago-Mare\u201d water mass\nThe gypsum 87Sr\/86Sr data at Eraclea Minoa (0.708704-0.708813; Fig. 2), like the Stage 3 gypsums elsewhere in the Mediterranean (<0.708850; Roveri et al., 2014b), have substantially lower ratios than coeval ocean water (\u223c0.709022; McArthur et al., 2012). Modeled 87Sr\/86Sr of mixtures of Atlantic seawater and circum-Mediterranean freshwater show that measurable deviations from the oceanic 87Sr\/86Sr signature are achieved when river discharge constitutes at least 25% of the total water fluxes (Topper et al., 2014). The Upper Gypsum 87Sr\/86Sr data therefore indicate that the Lago-Mare water mass was a marine water body strongly influenced by continental-derived sources with lower than marine 87Sr\/86Sr.\nIf Mediterranean base-level at times of gypsum precipitation was low enough to expose basin margin sediments, rivers draining these sediments may have influenced the water composition in Caltanissetta. Primary Lower Gypsum, both in situ (Stage 1) and reworked (Stage 2; Manzi et al., 2021), is abundant in the Caltanissetta Basin. Local rivers draining the margins may therefore have provided additional Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n, but would have had relatively high 87Sr\/86Sr (\u223c0.7090; Lugli et al., 2010). However, the catchments of these rivers today are dominated by Meso-Cenozoic limestones, which would have produced lower 87Sr\/86Sr (<0.7080).\nOn a more regional scale, the presence of ostracods derived from Eastern Paratethys suggests that this water body was a contributor of low 87Sr\/86Sr non-marine water (0.7084-0.7085; Grothe et al., 2020) to the Mediterranean during Stage 3 (e.g. Andreetto et al., 2021a). Climate model simulations for the late Miocene show that the hydrological budget of the Eastern Paratethys was positive during the MSC (Marzocchi et al., 2016). This means that this low-salinity water flow to the Mediterranean was not restricted only to times of marl deposition, where the Paratethyan fauna is found, but was present also during the evaporitic phases. The Mediterranean's major rivers, including the Nile and Rh\u00f4ne (0.7060 and 0.7087 respectively; e.g. Topper et al., 2011), which today make up >80% of the total Mediterranean river discharge, are also likely to have contributed low 87Sr\/86Sr water, along with North African fluvial systems that are currently dry (e.g. the Eosahabi River that flowed from Messinian Lake Chad), but for which there is evidence of late Miocene flow (Griffin, 2006).\nMass-balance calculations were used to explore the relative proportions of Sr2+ derived from the possible sources that explain the 87Sr\/86Sr data at Eraclea Minoa (Fig. 5\na). If we assume that water from Eastern Paratethys was characterized by river-like Sr concentrations (Figs. 5b-c), our model suggests that a maximum of \u223c20% Atlantic seawater is required to reproduce the gypsum 87Sr\/86Sr data (Fig. 5b). This result is in agreement with the box model calculations of Topper et al. (2014) and points to the presence of a strongly diluted marine water mass with a restricted Atlantic-Mediterranean connection during Stage 3 gypsum formation.\nRestricted ocean inflow can be provided by an Atlantic-Mediterranean gateway either as a one-way flow or with a parallel outflow. The two-way flow configuration facilitates the formation of gypsum because it entails a larger inflow of water (and ions) and keeps the salinity below halite saturation (Krijgsman and Meijer, 2008). The presence of gypsum and absence of large volumes of demonstrably in-situ halite in Stage 1 and 3 units (Roveri et al., 2014a; Andreetto et al., 2021a) is consistent with this scenario. However, two-way exchange requires Mediterranean base-level to be equal with the Atlantic sea-level (Krijgsman and Meijer, 2008), which means the marginal Mediterranean subbasins remain permanently submerged. This is the case in Stage 1. However, the evidence of substantial base-level change (section 4.5) and the frequent switching from subaqueous to continental sedimentation on the margins (Andreetto et al., 2021a, 2022) make persistent two-way exchange during the UG highly unlikely and support a small, unidirectional Atlantic input to the Mediterranean (Fig. 6\n). Existing box models simulations of the blocked outflow scenario result in rapid and voluminous halite precipitation (Krijgsman and Meijer, 2008). However, these simulations do not include the inflow of low-salinity water from Eastern Paratethys. One possibility is that inflow from Paratethys, with a small Atlantic contribution may have kept the Lago-Mare water mass below halite saturation, but allowed it, episodically, to achieve gypsum saturation.\n\n\n4.3\nImplications of UG cycles for base-level and insolation\nEvaporite-marl alternations denote cycles of concentration and dilution of the water mass with respect to evaporitic ions and are commonly associated with water level changes (Lowenstein, 1988; Lugli et al., 2010). Reconstructing base-level changes in ancient evaporitic settings with confidence is difficult because reliable paleobathymetric indicators such as fossils and ichnofossils are commonly absent from high-salinity environments and evaporitic lithofacies are rarely diagnostic of any particular water depth. The UG cycles at Eraclea Minoa are unusual because sub-unit D contains in-situ ostracods which do have paleobathymetric requirements. Living relatives of C. agrigentina (e.g. C. torosa), which dominates Biofacies 1 (Fig. 2), tolerate only a few tens of meters of water depth (Grossi et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2016). The more diverse Biofacies 2 at the top of sub-unit D, by contrast, is considered to indicate water depths up to 100 m (Stoica et al., 2016). The ostracod assemblages therefore suggest that the water depth increased during the deposition of sub-unit D (Fig. 7\na).\nThe presence, in one marl layer interbedded with massive selenite beds (sub-unit C) in cycle 3, of both C. agrigentina and L. muelleri, which is extinct but also thought to have inhabited shallow water (Grossi et al., 2015), suggests that the selenites precipitated in shallow water. However, there is no physical or paleobiological evidence of very shallow water conditions in the cumulate gypsum of sub-unit B. In other ancient evaporitic settings, the transition from cumulates to bottom-grown selenites is commonly interpreted to indicate a shallowing-upward trend (Ort\u00ed et al., 2014; Warren, 2016) and sequences of cumulate and bottom-grown halite layers characterize lake level falls in the Dead Sea today (Sirota et al., 2021). It is possible therefore that the transition from sub-unit B to C equates to a shallowing-upward trend through gypsum deposition (Fig. 7a).\nThe distribution of gypsum and marl across the Caltanissetta Basin may also provide insights into the relative water depth of the two lithologies. Gypsum occurs throughout the basin with a fairly constant thickness, whereas the evaporite-free marl intervals thin eastward towards the foreland area and above intrabasinal structural highs (Manzi et al., 2009), where they are barren or only contain Biofacies 1 ostracods (e.g. Balza Soletta section; Maniscalco et al., 2019). Manzi et al. (2009) interpreted this distribution as the consequence of continuous subaqueous deposition with eastward thinning of the marls related to increased distance from the terrigenous source. An alternative interpretation is that the base-level was high enough to precipitate gypsum across the whole Caltanissetta Basin, but dropped during marl deposition, exposing more marginal areas to erosion and\/or non-deposition and leaving only the deeper depocenters (e.g. Eraclea Minoa) underwater. During the subsequent base-level rise, recorded in Eraclea Minoa by the appearance of Biofacies 2 ostracods, these marginal areas were drowned again and accumulated thin, Biofacies 1-bearing marls. If correct, this interpretation suggests that there was a higher water level at the beginning of gypsum precipitation than at the beginning of sub-unit D marls (Fig. 7a).\nIf the Caltanissetta Basin was part of a larger Lago-Mare water mass, cyclical base-level changes seen there are likely to be the consequence of fluctuations in the discharge of one, or more, of the Mediterranean's water sources. The Mediterranean's freshwater budget is highly variable on precession timescales. It is enhanced during the insolation maxima, when more rainwater from North African monsoon and Atlantic storms is delivered to the Mediterranean (e.g. Marzocchi et al., 2016), and it reaches the lowest values during the insolation minima, when less freshwater is supplied and more water is lost by evaporation. It is therefore likely that base-level variations were in phase with the insolation forcing: the highstands coincided with insolation maxima and the lowstands with insolation minima (e.g. Simon et al., 2017). Previously, the gypsum beds at Eraclea Minoa have been correlated with increasing insolation following the insolation minima and the diatomites and ostracod-bearing marls tied to the transition from insolation maxima to minima (Fig. 7a; van der Laan et al., 2006; Manzi et al., 2009). This is challenged by the relative base-level changes reconstructed here, which instead suggest that the base of the ostracod-bearing marls at Eraclea Minoa represents lowstand phases, corresponding to insolation minima (Fig. 7a), while the shallowing through gypsum sub-units B and C, corresponds to part of the transition from insolation maxima to minima (Fig. 7a).\nThis revised astronomical tuning dates the base of the Upper Gypsum at Eraclea Minoa to \u223c5.515 Ma and the first indication of Paratethyan ostracods to \u223c5.47 Ma. This is the oldest age known in the Mediterranean and contradicts the hypothesis that the migration of Paratethyan ostracods occurred as a single Mediterranean-wide event at 5.42 Ma (substages 3.1 and 3.2 (or Lago-Mare phase) of Roveri et al., 2014a; see also Roveri et al., 2008 and Grossi et al., 2011), possibly prompted by a sudden increase of the Paratethys outflow (Marzocchi et al., 2016).\n\n\n4.4\nConnectivity changes terminated gypsum precipitation\nThe UG sediments at Eraclea Minoa also contain evidence of changing palaeoenvironmental conditions. The vertical transition from sub-mm\/mm-sized gypsum crystals in the balatino lithofacies (sub-unit B), which require supersaturated conditions favoring the formation of new nuclei over crystal growth (Lugli et al., 2010), to increasingly larger selenites (sub-unit C), which require gradually lower degree of brine supersaturation to grow larger (Lugli et al., 2010), is indicative of a progressive reduction of the brine concentration approaching the transition with sub-unit D. Then, the sub-unit C\/D transition marks a major paleoenvironmental and paleohydrological event, testified by the abrupt cessation of gypsum precipitation and the appearance of shallow-water fauna. Microthermometry studies on fluid inclusions in gypsum lithofacies (Bigi et al., 2022) and thermodynamic calculations (Aloisi et al., 2022) show that the Eraclea gypsums precipitated from the evaporation of seawater at a salinity \u223c 115 g kg\u22121. The ostracods in the overlying marls show a gradual transition from dominantly C. agrigentina (Biofacies 1), which tolerates a wide range of salinities (Grossi et al., 2015), to the more diverse Biofacies 2, which indicate fresher (oligohaline) conditions (Fig. 7b; Stoica et al., 2016).\nOne possibility is that the gradual drop in concentration with respect to gypsum and the salinity decrease across the sub-unit C\/D transition and through sub-unit D were prompted by increased continental runoff (Manzi et al., 2009). In this case, however, a base-level rise should have accompanied the precipitation of gypsum, in order to bring enough ions for it to precipitate. In turn, this means that the base level would reach the highstand during deposition of Biofacies 2 (Fig. 7a; Manzi et al., 2009). This scenario is in contradiction with our water level reconstruction, that indicate a shallowing through the gypsum and a deepening through the sub-unit D marls (Fig. 7a). The lessening of Atlantic inflow, which achieves both the base-level fall through sub-units B-C and the associated subtle declining trend in the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios within individual gypsums (Figs. 2, 7a), seems to be a more plausible mechanism. In the context of deposition during a Mediterranean base-level fall, it is possible, therefore, that the abrupt transition from gypsum to ostracod-bearing marls was the consequence of the base level falling below the Caltanissetta Basin, leaving it as a perched lacustrine system above the deeper areas covered by the \u201cLago-Mare\u201d water mass. The generally lower 87Sr\/86Sr ratios and larger 87Sr\/86Sr variations in the Eraclea Minoa marls, indicate a greater influence of freshwater inputs to the basin compared to the gypsums that have higher and less variable 87Sr\/86Sr ratios. This suggests that the Caltanissetta Basin formed a perched lake during marl deposition at lowstands. Compared to seawater-influenced basins, lacustrine settings are, indeed, much more sensitive to subtle changes in fluvial discharge (e.g. Bista et al., 2021), resulting in rapid changes in the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio measured on the ostracods.\n\n\n4.5\nHigh amplitude fluctuations of the Mediterranean base-level\nThe same ostracods biofacies as those in sub-unit D are found both in marginal Mediterranean marls, where they typically alternate with continental facies, and in the deep basins (e.g. Sites 975B, 372, 129A; see Andreetto et al., 2021a), where the marls alternate with laminated and clastic gypsum (Andreetto et al., 2021a). For the deep basins to develop the shallow-water conditions required by the ostracods, the Mediterranean water level had to fall below the intermediate position of the Caltanissetta Basin. This means that Caltanissetta and deeper basins accumulated the shallow-water ostracod-bearing marls during lowstand phases of the Lago-Mare water, exposing the marginal basins to continental deposition and\/or erosion (Fig. 8\ne). By contrast, higher Mediterranean water levels are required to populate the shallow marginal basins with these same Paratethyan ostracods (Stoica et al., 2016). This is supported by the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios measured on some of these marginal basin ostracods, which point to mixing between high-87Sr\/86Sr local fluvial waters with the Lago-Mare water mass (Andreetto et al., 2021b, 2022). During these highstand phases of marginal basin ostracod-rich marl deposition, the Caltanissetta and deep basins were experiencing much deeper water conditions (i.e. several hundreds of meters; Fig. 8b).\nThe depth constraints provided by the shallow-water ostracod assemblages indicate that marl deposition was not synchronous across the Mediterranean during base-level highstands at insolation maxima (Roveri et al., 2008, 2014a), but sequential, tracking Mediterranean-wide, high-amplitude (several hundred to thousands of meters) base-level fluctuations (Figs. 8b-e). This model of high-amplitude base level changes, earlier hypothesized by Hardie and Lowenstein (2004) and Rouchy and Caruso (2006) is now supported by integrated sedimentological, paleontological and geochemical observations that show that the Mediterranean was at times both relatively full (Fig. 8b) and empty (Fig. 8e) during each Stage 3 precession cycle. This model helps reconcile observations that support the full versus desiccated debate that has afflicted the MSC Stage 3 successions for decades (Andreetto et al., 2021a).\n\n\n4.6\nImplications of Atlantic-Mediterranean connectivity for ocean chemistry\nOn long timescales (>100 kyr), marine alkalinity and CaCO3 burial are balanced by the response of silicate weathering to changes in atmospheric CO2 and associated temperature. Many biogeochemical models (e.g. Berner, 1991; Lenton et al., 2018) assume that on these long timescales perturbations to seawater chemistry caused by evaporite precipitation are balanced by evaporite dissolution during weathering. However, evaporites form and dissolve three orders of magnitude more quickly than other sediments (Nichols et al., 2009) and this approach fails to consider whether abrupt and short-term evaporite-driven chemical perturbations can propagate into aspects of the carbon cycle that have longer-term climate implications. The box model study by Shields and Mills (2020) explores the impact of gypsum on ocean chemistry and its knock-on consequences for CaCO3 burial, atmospheric CO2 and global temperature by allowing the non-steady-state ocean calcium inventory to be driven by CaSO4 precipitation and the return flux to the ocean from weathering. Their results demonstrate that a decrease in ocean [Ca] as a consequence of gypsum deposition, because it is not associated with an alkalinity change, leads to decreasing CaCO3 burial and higher oceanic pH, resulting in decreasing atmospheric CO2 and global cooling (Shields and Mills, 2020). However, their sensitivity experiments impose a constant gypsum precipitation and weathering forcing for 1 million years which is not a realistic reflection of the pattern of ocean [Ca] extraction as a consequence of the MSC. Here we explore what a realistic evaporite precipitation and weathering flux would look like over the duration of the MSC and consider its possible implications.\nIn contrast with the constant precipitation driver modeled by Shields and Mills (2020), the precessional gypsum-marl cyclicity that characterizes both MSC Stage 1 and 3 suggests that extraction of Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n ions from the global ocean was episodic and probably endured for only a few thousand years in each precession cycle. Further modeling experiments are required to evaluate the degree to which the regular switching on and off of gypsum precipitation modifies the modeled consequences for carbonate burial, atmospheric CO2 and global temperatures (Shields and Mills, 2020) as a result of (partial) recovery of the system between evaporite pulses. However, without near synchronous return of Ca2+ ions to the ocean as a result of evaporite weathering, the reduction in oceanic [Ca] is unlikely to have bounced back completely, leading to a progressive decline in seawater [Ca] from one precessional evaporite event to the next. Stage 2 evaporites are heavily dominated by halite, not gypsum. However, it is possible that constant extraction of these Ca2+ ions did characterize the \u223c50 kyr duration of this phase of the MSC, since the volumetrics of the halite succession preserved, requires constant input of ocean water (Krijgsman and Meijer, 2008) which must also have contained Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n. Taken together then, the rate of Ca2+ ion extraction over the course of the entire MSC is likely to have varied and to have been most substantial during Stage 2.\nRecent evaporite volume estimates for the MSC (Haq et al., 2020) are broadly similar to those used by Shields and Mills (2020) to estimate the scale of the Ca2+ extraction during salt giant formation. Both are based on the volumes of evaporites that are still preserved in the Mediterranean today, and therefore represent a minimum. That being the case, whether pulsed or continuous, this Late Miocene episode of CaSO4 extraction may have contributed to the cooling seen in time-equivalent SST records (Herbert et al., 2016).\nAlthough the net effect of the MSC was to extract Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n from the global ocean, the episodic nature of gypsum accumulation and Mediterranean-Atlantic connectivity also implies that the Mediterranean was, intermittently and at time-scales shorter than the MSC, a net source of Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n to the Atlantic. Evaluating episodic net Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n fluxes to the ocean during the MSC is particularly challenging since it depends not on the gypsum preserved today in the Mediterranean, but rather on what was originally precipitated and has been already dissolved (Wortmann and Payton, 2012). However, what we can evaluate from the Mediterranean's geological record is the nature of its connectivity with the Atlantic and from this it is possible to deduce the timing and likely duration of episodic net exchange of Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n between the Mediterranean to the global ocean.\nEvidence from both 87Sr\/86Sr data and box-modeling indicate that Stage 1 gypsum was precipitated while the Mediterranean experienced restricted, but two-way exchange with the Atlantic under conditions which broadly maintained eustatic sea level in the Mediterranean (e.g. Flecker et al., 2015 and references therein). This configuration will have resulted in net extraction of Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n ions from the ocean, at least during gypsum precipitation. Maximum dissolution of gypsum occurs during subaerial exposure with the formation of aquifers associated with active hydrology (Gustavson et al., 1982). Since there is no evidence of substantial base-level fall during the marl intervals in Stage 1, it is probable that there was relatively little weathering of the gypsum and therefore a limited return flux of these ions to the ocean.\nThe connectivity and base-level configurations during stages 2 and 3 are substantially different. Outflow to the Atlantic ceased, base-level fell and then, as shown in this study, fluctuated substantially during Stage 3. This exposed the Stage 1 gypsum that precipitated on the margins and stage 2 and 3 gypsum reworked or precipitated in deeper settings of the Mediterranean, to dissolution. However, without Mediterranean outflow, these weathered evaporitic ions were trapped in the Mediterranean and had no influence on global ocean chemistry. Outflow to the Atlantic started abruptly at the beginning of the Pliocene with the termination of the MSC, triggering the return of two-way exchange and the reestablishment of open marine conditions in the Mediterranean.\nIn summary, the MSC evaporite weathering flux to the ocean was episodic and largely out of phase with gypsum precipitation-driven extraction, potentially resulting in dynamic changes to ocean chemistry on the timescale of the MSC. Interestingly, the main impact Shields and Mills (2020) found of modeling a 1 million year CaSO4 weathering event was a rapid rise in CaCO3 burial and a transient peak in atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated warming, that occurred only 150 kyrs after initiation. With this in mind, it is tempting to attribute at least part of the abrupt warming in early Pliocene sea surface temperature records (Herbert et al., 2016) to a Mediterranean-derived pulse of Ca2+ ions. Testing this hypothesis will require more sophisticated biogeochemical modeling and better quantitative constraints on the chemistry of Mediterranean outflow. If true however, it would suggest that the most important impact of the Zanclean deluge was not the sudden inundation of a Mediterranean empty of water for hundreds of thousands of years, but the abrupt flushing into the Atlantic of the ponded brine and weathering products of a salt giant.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe UG selenites at Eraclea Minoa contain in-situ marine calcareous nannofossils and display 87Sr\/86Sr ratios which indicate that a small Atlantic flux (\u226420%) supplied the Mediterranean with Ca2+ and SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n ions during gypsum precipitation. Mass-balance calculations suggest that the remaining \u226580% of the Lago-Mare water mass was supplied by Eastern Paratethys and large Mediterranean rivers. Gypsum precipitation, first from settling crystals nucleated in the water column (balatino, sub-unit B) and then from bottom-grown selenites (sub-unit C), occurred during a phase of base-level fall coincident with the transition from insolation maxima to insolation minima. During insolation minima, low diversity ostracod-bearing marls (Biofacies 1 of sub-unit D), that constrain the water depth to a few tens of meters, were deposited in an isolated, lacustrine Caltanissetta Basin perched above the Lago-Mare water mass, which persisted in the deep subbasins. The transition from Biofacies 1 to 2 indicates rising water levels in the lake. Similar ostracod-bearing marls are found in both shallower and deeper settings across the Mediterranean, indicating that marl deposition was asynchronous during Stage 3, tracking high-amplitude, Mediterranean-wide base level changes (Fig. 8a). Sedimentological, geochemical and biological data from Eraclea Minoa suggest that the Mediterranean experienced (at least) 7 substantial, cyclic base-level changes during Stage 3. A revised astronomical tuning indicates that MSC Stage 3 started at 5.515 Ma, with the first occurrence of Paratethyan ostracods on Sicily at 5.47 Ma. This model for (upper) gypsum formation, which envisages periods during which the Mediterranean was both relatively full and empty, helps to reconcile many of the discrepancies between offshore- and onshore-based interpretations of the final phase of the Messinian Salinity Crisis. It also suggests that any impact of the Mediterranean salt giant formation and evaporite weathering during stages 2 and\/or 3 on ocean biogeochemistry occurred in the Pliocene once Mediterranean outflow was re-established.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nFederico Andreetto conducted the field work in 2020 and 2021, prepared the samples for 87Sr\/86Sr analyzes and paleontological observations and wrote the manuscript.

Basic relationships between solute concentration (C) and discharge (Q) have long been used to infer changes in transport and reaction pathways in the Critical Zone (e.g., Anderson et al., 1997; Arora et al., 2020; Baronas et al., 2017; Basu et al., 2010; Bieroza and Heathwaite, 2015; Chanat et al., 2002; Evans and Davies, 1998; Godsey et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 1969; Miller and Drever, 1977; Knapp et al., 2020; Rose et al., 2018; Torres and Baronas, 2021). Weathering-derived solutes (e.g., Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Si) often display chemostatic behavior or little variability in concentration over a broad range of discharge values (e.g., Diamond and Cohen, 2018; Godsey et al., 2009; Herndon et al., 2015; Koger et al., 2018; Sullivan et al., 2019; Wlostowski et al., 2018). This capacity for solute export to \u2018keep pace\u2019 with discharge has been attributed to a substantial supply of rock-derived solutes that are accessed during flood events (e.g., Basu et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2011), while others have suggested sufficiently rapid reaction rates such that the timescale of weathering does not lag behind the timescale of fluid transport (e.g., Ameli et al., 2017; Maher, 2011). Under such conditions, water-rock reactions buffer the chemistry of fluid contributing to streamflow.\nConnecting stream solute chemistry to the reactions occurring in hillslopes is challenging. Previous studies have noted that multiple coupled solubilization and secondary mineral formation reactions can result in comparable solute concentrations (e.g., Kim et al., 2017; Torres and Baronas, 2021). Hence, a variety of reactive pathways may contribute both across the heterogeneous structure of the near-surface Critical Zone and over transient fluctuations in infiltration rate and discharge to produce apparently chemostatic behavior. Furthermore, most observations of chemostatic solute signatures in upland watersheds are based on relatively low-frequency monitoring records typically spanning seasonal and annual timescales (e.g., Diamond and Cohen, 2018; Godsey et al., 2009; Herndon et al., 2015; Koger et al., 2018; Sullivan et al., 2019; Wlostowski et al., 2018). As a result, the C-Q relationships inferred from these records often integrate over indiscriminate sampling \u201csnapshots\u201d of systems subject to hydrological and biogeochemical perturbations across a wide range of timescales (e.g., individual storm events, seasonal variation in baseflow).\nIndividual storm events can generate as much as 80% of annual solute fluxes in small catchments across a variety of climates and lithology (e.g., Inamdar et al., 2006; Lesack, 1993; Petrone et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2021). Only a limited number of studies have reported data sufficient to compare weathering-derived C-Q patterns across individual storms and systematic monitoring records. Rose et al. (2018) monitored C-Q patterns in 44 individual storms spanning 11 years in White Clay Creek, located in Pennsylvania, USA. They reported consistency between individual storm and long-term behavior, although the latter was compiled from storm events rather than an independent monitoring effort. At the Erlenbach catchment in Switzerland, Knapp et al. (2020) also suggested consistency between base flow and flood C-Q relationships for major elements derived from weathering. In contrast, many interpretations of stream solute chemistry during individual precipitation events utilize mixing models that suggest bypassing of the subsurface below soil during intense infiltration (e.g., Bazemore et al., 1994; Gardner et al., 2017; Kurtz et al., 2011; Mulholland et al., 1990; Schellekens et al., 2004). Hence, it remains unclear to what extent the behavior of weathering-derived solutes during storm events simply falls within the broader C-Q patterns observed over seasonal and annual variations in discharge, or if these events trigger major modifications to the routing of water to the stream and thus the origin and composition of solutes recorded across storm hydrographs. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether C-Q relationships break down at high discharge rates produced by extreme events, which are presently projected to increase in frequency with intensification of the hydrologic cycle.\nAnalyses of C-Q patterns and the exploration of the potential underlying factors that yield apparent chemostasis in C-Q relationships of rock-derived solutes are greatly aided by tracers sensitive to the water-rock reaction network producing these solutes. A new generation of highly precise and increasingly routine stable metal(loid) isotope analysis (e.g., B, Li, and Si) now offers heightened sensitivity to the precipitation and dissolution reactions that underlie C-Q patterns (e.g., Burton and Vigier, 2012; Fernandez et al., 2022; Fries et al., 2019; Frings et al., 2021; Gaillardet and Lemarchand, 2018). Among this suite of elements, lithium (Li) and its stable isotopes are an ideal tracer of the fluid-rock weathering reactions that generate rock-derived solutes, due to characteristic mass-dependent fractionation during secondary clay formation (e.g., Huh et al., 2001; Pistiner and Henderson, 2003; Rudnick et al., 2004). Furthermore, Critical Zone Li isotope signatures are simplified relative to many other weathering-derived solutes because of minimal, nominally non-fractionating Li uptake by plants (Lemarchand et al., 2010; Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2014). Furthermore, recent efforts to couple fluid flow paths and fractionating reactions in a forward modeling framework seem to suggest that stable isotope ratios may afford heightened sensitivity to variations in fluid drainage rates and patterns compared to solute concentrations (Druhan and Maher, 2017; Fernandez et al., 2022).\nHere, we present a high-frequency record of stable Li isotopes and rock-derived solutes during an intense storm fed by an \u201catmospheric river\u201d (as defined in Ralph et al., 2018 and DeFlorio et al., 2018) using a heavily instrumented upland hillslope (Rivendell, Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, California, USA) draining into Elder Creek, a steep canyon stream. Prior C-Q analysis of Elder Creek based on the USGS Hydrologic Benchmark Network describes strongly chemostatic behavior in the major rock-derived solutes over three orders of magnitude in discharge (Godsey et al., 2009). Kim et al. (2014, 2017) used groundwater and stream chemistry to argue that water-rock reactions in the vadose zone constitute the principal source of solute flux through this system, although they lacked direct observations of rock moisture above the water table. Subsequent novel instrumentation has allowed unprecedented access to the fluid draining through the interior of the hillslope (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Tune et al., 2020). We have previously used the major ion concentrations and Li isotope signatures of these fluids to constrain the silicate weathering reactions that govern solute production and cycling across the vadose zone and through the shallow aquifer in a forward, multi-component numerical reactive transport framework (Golla et al., 2021). From this basis, we now leverage a novel data set of hydrologic monitoring, water isotopes, and Li isotope signatures to uncover sensitivity in the rock-derived solutes of a characteristically chemostatic stream across a storm hydrograph.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nStudy area and sampling\nThe 17-km2 Elder Creek watershed is located within the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in Mendocino County, California USA as part of the U.S. National Science Foundation Critical Zone Observatory program (Fig. 1\n). Elder Creek is a relatively steep canyon river, in an actively uplifting landscape, fed by tributaries which are primarily cut by periodic debris flows. We utilize the extensively instrumented Rivendell hillslope (Kim et al., 2014; Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Salve et al., 2012; Tune et al., 2020). Rivendell consists of thin soil (0.3 - 0.7 m) and thick, fractured weathered argillite (4 - 30 m) (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Tune et al., 2020) locally interbedded with sandstone lenses, typifying the Coastal Belt of the Franciscan Complex (McLaughlin et al., 2000). The mineral assemblage of fresh bedrock is comprised of a mixture of primary minerals (quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, chlorite) and clays (chlorite, smectite, kaolinite, illite) (Gu et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2014). Active regional uplift and erosion occur at 0.2-0.4 mm\/yr (Fuller et al., 2009).\nThe study area is characterized by a Mediterranean climate (i.e., warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters), where most precipitation is received as rain with an annual mean total of \u223c2042 mm and temperatures can range from -8 to 32 oC (Kim et al., 2014; Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Salve et al., 2012). Hydrologic surveying shows that the height of the water table at midslope can vary by as much as 10 m (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018). The thin soil layer and unsaturated weathered bedrock host reactive gases (Tune et al., 2020) and the deep roots of a mixed conifer-hardwood evergreen forest (Oshun et al., 2016; Salve et al., 2012). Runoff to the stream channel is dominated by subsurface flow. Overland flow on the Rivendell hillslope generally does not occur (Salve et al., 2012). However, saturated overland flow (i.e., Dunne overland flow; Dunne and Black, 1970a,b) has been observed in topographically convergent areas during intense storms. The storm reported in this study was the result of an atmospheric river that produced runoff as much as \u223c34 times greater than the mean annual value. During this period, Elder Creek was sampled for solute chemistry and stable isotope analysis at high frequency from January 5-13, 2017. Groundwater wells distributed across the Rivendell hillslope were sampled within the period of the storm event (January 5-11).\nAt Rivendell, there is a unique Vadose Zone Monitoring System (VMS), which consists of a pair of instrumented sleeves inserted through subvertical boreholes across \u223c16 m of the hillslope (Golla et al., 2021; Tune et al., 2020). Each sleeve is lined with a set of 10 ports approximately 1.5 m apart and equipped with discrete lysimeter samplers to collect waters draining weathered bedrock. In addition, each set of VMS sampling ports is separately capable of collecting gases through perforated tubing and of measuring water content and temperature with time-domain transmission sensors. Among the 20 total ports, the first eight ports from 0.8-6.9 m below land surface are perennially unsaturated, whereas the deepest two ports at 14.7 m and 16.5 m remain fully saturated throughout the year. The ports in between 6.9 m and 14.7 m are seasonally saturated due to fluctuation of the groundwater table elevation. A complete description of the corresponding depths to the VMS sampling apparatus can be found in Tune et al. (2020) and further technical details of the general functioning of the VMS have been outlined by Dahan et al. (2009) and Rimon et al. (2007).\n\n\n2.2\nHydrological monitoring\nGroundwater levels are measured via continuous pressure transducers across a network of 12 wells (Fig. 1). A U.S. Geological Survey gauging station (#11475560) monitors streamflow every 15 minutes and is located approximately 30 m upstream of the collection point for water chemistry. Precipitation data are collected across a network of tipping bucket rain gauges and distributed by the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory (https:\/\/dendra.science\/). Historical precipitation for the Elder Creek watershed comes from PRISM (Daly et al., 2008, 2015).\nTime-domain transmission (TDT) sensors along one of the VMS sleeves provide records of water content and temperature at 15-minute intervals. To approximate time-variable rock moisture storage in the root zone, we use relative moisture contents measured via TDT sensors at 1.95 m, 3.64 m, and 5.22 m depths in the VMS. These three moisture content time series are averaged to create a composite time series for the root zone that is scaled from the minimum dynamic storage (0 mm) to the maximum dynamic rock moisture storage of 280 mm (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018).\nTo calculate a rate of drainage from the root zone (i.e. vadose zone flux), we establish a time-dependent root-zone water balance, based on our time series of rock moisture storage, precipitation (P), approximate interception (20%; Salve et al., 2012), and evapotranspiration (ET, 1.5 mm\/day annual average; PRISM, 2022):\n\n(1)\n\nD\n=\nP\n\u2212\n0.2\n\u204e\nP\n\u2212\nE\nT\n\u2212\n\u0394\nS\n,\n\n\n where \u0394S is the daily change in storage calculated from the composite moisture time series and D is drainage in mm\/day.\n\n\n2.3\nGeochemical analyses\nAll water isotope samples were analyzed at the University of California, Berkeley Center for Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry. Samples were run via Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry on a Thermo Delta PLUS XL instrument. Data are reported in standard delta per-mille notation relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b4\nD\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nS\nM\nO\nW\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\u00d7\n1000\n,\n\n\n where a similar expression can be written for stable oxygen isotopes (i.e., 18O and 16O).

These data are available as supplementary material.\nThe concentrations of cations and anions were measured at the PARI analytical platform of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) with an Agilent 7900 quadrupole ICP-MS and a Dionex DX-120 ion chromatograph, respectively. The accuracy of cation concentrations is based on the precision of the percent error (\u22645%) of repeated measurements of the SLRS-5 river water standard.\nRadiogenic strontium (Sr) isotopes were measured at IPGP. Sr purification was performed by ion chromatography using Eichrom Sr-SPEC resin following a method developed by Pin and Bassin (1992) and Sr isotope ratio measurements were made with a Thermo Scientific Neptune MC-ICP-MS following the method outlined in Hajj et al. (2017) (see Supplementary Text S1 for further details).\nLithium isotopes were measured using a Thermo Scientific Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the PARI analytical platform of IPGP HELGES laboratory of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) German Research Centre for Geosciences. Samples were treated with HF and H2O2 to eliminate Si and organic matter and loaded onto columns filled with 4 mL of BioRad AG50-X12 (200-400 mesh) resin for Li purification following the chemical separation protocol of James and Palmer (2000). Prior to introduction into an Elemental Scientific APEX-HydroFlouric desolvating nebulizer, the eluted fraction was evaporated to near-dryness and taken up in 0.5-M HNO3 to obtain a 20 ng\/mL Li solution. Analyses were performed with operating conditions similar to those reported by Millot et al. (2004).

In addition, we also report measurements of other reference materials for basalt (BHVO-2: 4.77 \u00b10.09\u2030; JB-2: 4.99 \u00b10.06\u2030) and soil (TILL-1: \n7.21\n\u00b1\n0.27\n\u2030). The measurements of basalt standards are in agreement with published measurements (Li et al., 2019 and references therein), while the TILL-1 measurement is slightly higher than literature values (Weynell et al., 2017, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). In the following figures, both the 95% confidence interval calculated from sample replicate measurements (Equation 4) and the 2\u03c3 associated to repeated analyses of the OSIL Atlantic seawater reference material are shown as error bars for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi.\nAll data are presented in Table 1\n. The results of solute chemistry and Li isotope analyses reported in this study were part of the same analytical session as in Golla et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nDelivery of storm water to Rivendell and Elder Creek\nAn intense storm as a result of an atmospheric river occurred on January 5-13, 2017 delivering 416 mm of precipitation (Fig. 2\na). Relative to storms between water years 1981 and 2018, 2017 storm was in the 95th percentile of storm intensity and the 89th percentile of total storm precipitation (Fig. S1). Across the same period, this storm was the 12th most intense storm on record (57 mm\/hr) relative to an average value of 33 mm\/hr (Fig. S1). The 2017 water year was relatively wet, amounting to 3375 mm of total rainfall (Fig. 2a), which is \u223c65% more than the annual average (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018).\nEvery year, vadose zone storage increases with the infiltration of the first rains of the wet season and vadose zone water storage decreases progressively over the dry, growing season. In 2017, the atmospheric river arrived after vadose zone storage had approached field capacity (Fig. 2b), defined as the maximum water content held in tension by soil and unsaturated weathered bedrock once drainage has ceased following infiltration. No overland flow was observed in the location of the VMS, meaning that this storm triggered transport through the vadose zone as opposed to an increase in water storage. The vadose zone water flux was higher for this event relative to other storms in water year 2017 (Fig. 2b) and peaked at 142 mm\/day, which is 14 times the average wet season vadose zone water flux. Such resolution of water storage in and flux through a partially saturated bedrock vadose zone is rare and typically difficult to quantify, and is only afforded in this study by the unique VMS instrumentation (subsection 2.1; Tune et al., 2020).\nDuring the storm, groundwater levels observed in the wells rose (Fig. S2), despite the fact that the water table was already high in the midst of the wet season. This small but detectable change led to an increase in the hillslope hydraulic gradient (\n\n\n\u0394\nH\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n) (Fig. 2c) and thus, groundwater flux (Fig. 2c). During the storm, \n\n\n\u0394\nH\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n increased between Wells 12 and 6 by 5% (bracketed by dashed lines in Fig. 2c). Assuming a constant hydraulic conductivity, we infer that the groundwater flux increased by 5% between the start and peak of the storm. Hence, we observe a concurrent increase in fluid flux across both the bedrock vadose zone and the laterally draining groundwater as a result of this intense storm event.\nThis groundwater flow rate was the highest recorded for the season and roughly coincident with annual peak runoff (95th percentile) in Elder Creek (Fig. S1). Relative to other water years from 1968 to 2020, the peak Elder Creek discharge produced by this intense storm is in the 79th percentile of annual peak discharge values. In the Elder Creek watershed, the majority of runoff occurs during storm events (Salve et al., 2012). For example, in this relatively wet 2017 water year, the 8-day storm event constituted about 14% of the total annual volume of water discharged by Elder Creek. Long-term physical monitoring of groundwater and vadose zone storage at the site indicates that Elder Creek runoff is nearly entirely derived from groundwater. Overland flow and lateral flow through soils do not contribute to runoff (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Salve et al., 2012). During the January 2017 storm event, neither was observed along the hillslope. Therefore, flow through the vadose zone to the water table kept pace with the intensity of rainfall.\n\n\n3.2\nStable isotopes of water\nThe atmospheric river that produced this storm delivered a substantial volume of isotopically depleted water (\u03b4D = \u221286\u2030; Fig. S3). This depleted signature was detected within the hillslope using the unique instrumentation of the VMS (Fig. 3\n). The propagation of the depleted \u03b4D signature in the weathered bedrock vadose zone mimics a breakthrough curve. At 1.4 m depth, the signal arrived 8 days after the end of the storm event while the arrival at 4.5 m took 64 days. Notably, this transmitted storm signal appears attenuated at depth, measuring \u221250\u2030 at 4.5 m versus \u221255\u2030 at 1.4 m.\nIn Elder Creek, high-frequency stream sampling revealed larger variability in \u03b4D during the timescale of the storm relative to the vadose zone (inset in Fig. 3). As discharge peaked in response to the storm, stream water showed isotopic depletion to as much as \u221259\u2030, suggesting that water from the storm event directly entered the stream as precipitation. However, at the time that streamwater was showing depletion, the isotopic signature of the storm had only penetrated to \u22641.4 m within the VMS along the Rivendell hillslope. This observation implies that the storm water only gradually traversed the subsurface, which will be important to the interpretation of subsurface reactivity.\n\n\n3.3\nStrontium isotopes\nRadiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr values of groundwater sampled across the hillslope and Elder Creek are consistent within analytical uncertainty and average 0.70977 \u00b1 3 (Fig. S4a). These fluids are all slightly lower than the fresh bedrock (87Sr\/86Sr = 0.70984 \u00b1 3). Therefore, there is negligible variability in groundwater 87Sr\/86Sr across the hillslope and into the stream, as well as between samples collected prior to and during the storm. Furthermore, the differences between fluid and solid-phase samples reported here are small compared to variations observed in other sites of similar lithology (e.g., Chapman et al., 2012; Meek et al., 2016).\n\n\n3.4\nC-Q behavior\nAs previously reported (Godsey et al., 2009; Maher, 2011), chemostatic conditions are reflected in the long-term C-Q patterns at Elder Creek (Fig. 4\n). Despite the intensity of this storm, the new data appear to largely extrapolate long-term export behavior, although some solutes slightly trend towards dilution (b = -1). An exception to this consistency is noted for potassium, where the b-exponent during the storm shifts to a positive value, implying mobilization (b = 1). This deviation may be a result of the strong biological influences exerted on potassium (e.g., plant uptake; Knapp et al., 2020; Rose et al., 2018). One study even argues for positive storm C-Q relationships including potassium due to exposure of fresh reactive mineral surface associated with physical crushing of rock in the stream channel (Morin et al., 2014), although we see no evidence of this for other solutes. While there are no historical data to reference, the C-Q behavior of Li appears to generally follow that of the major geogenic solutes, particularly silica.\nClearly, a wealth of information is contained within these storm data and in relation to the long-term records for these solutes. Here, we utilize these data specifically to analyze the extent to which high-intensity events are extrapolations of long-term behavior, and hence should ultimately reflect an expansion of the same underlying water-rock-life weathering reactions to more extreme conditions.\n\n\n3.5\nLithium isotopes\nSolute concentrations and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi values are corrected for atmospheric inputs (Supplementary Text S2) in order to isolate subsurface contributions (further discussed in subsection 4.1 and subsection 4.3). These corrections indicate that the contribution to dissolved Li by atmospheric inputs is <2%. Correspondingly, the maximum fraction of Li derived from rainwater would only adjust the measured values by +0.52\u2030 to +0.58\u2030 in the range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi observed in Elder Creek (+26\u2030 to +29\u2030) and is within the analytical uncertainty of \u00b10.76\u2030. Thus, we consider this contribution as negligible and do not apply a correction to the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi values. In addition, we normalize rain-corrected Li concentrations (hereinafter referred to as Li*) to Na* values to eliminate the effects of dilution in Li concentrations (Supplementary Text S2).\nLi dynamics over the course of the storm event reveal a general increase in Li*\/Na* and a decrease in \u03b4\n7Li (Fig. 5\n). The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signature decreased from a maximum of \n+\n28.9\n\u00b1\n0.1\n\u2030 to as low as \n+\n26.4\n\u00b1\n0.4\n\u2030 at the height of the storm. In contrast, the initial Li*\/Na* ratio increased by 0.24 \u03bcM\/mM to reach a maximum of 0.82 \u03bcM\/mM. However, the maximum Li*\/Na* value was observed on the falling limb of the hydrograph, whereas the minimum \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi was observed at peak discharge. Critically, both trends (decreasing \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and increasing Li*\/Na*) reflect an approach to bedrock values (\u03b4\n7Li = \u22120.57\u2030 and Li*\/Na* = 10.5 \u03bcM\/mM; Golla et al., 2021). We reiterate that these values are corrected for atmospheric inputs, and that the effects of dilution on Li* concentrations are removed through normalization to Na*.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nImpact of the storm on subsurface water storage and flow\nConsistent with observations of hydrological dynamics at the site (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Salve et al., 2012), precipitation delivered during this intense storm was routed through the bedrock vadose zone. This infiltration is evidenced by both the increases in vadose zone water flux and water table elevation concurrent with the storm (Fig. 2) and the breakthrough of a depleted \u03b4D signature in the vadose zone (Fig. 3). The subsurface transmission of such an intense storm event highlights the important role of rock moisture during the wet season in the routing of precipitation to drainage networks (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018). Such behavior is distinct from systems in which high-flow periods produce a large contribution of \u201cyoung\u201d water (i.e. shallow soil water or water that may not have even reached the subsurface at all) to the stream at the peak of the storm (e.g., Benettin et al., 2020; McGuire and McDonnell, 2006).\nRock moisture and groundwater contributions to streamflow during this intense storm event increased on the timescale of the storm itself. This is consistent with recent laboratory (Gu\u00e9rin et al., 2014) and field observations (Gu\u00e9rin et al., 2019) indicating a characteristic scaling relationship between rapid responses in runoff and groundwater flow rates during storms in small catchments (Fig. S5). Yet, the water isotope data indicate that groundwater was not composed of precipitation from this storm event. Rather, the progressive attenuation of the storm \u03b4D signal in the vadose zone with depth indicates mixing of the event water with vadose zone water storage, effectively displacing pre-existing rock moisture into the saturated zone (Fig. 3). While preferential flowpaths in some fractured bedrock dominated hillslopes may contribute significant event water to recharge or streamflow (Nimmo et al., 2002; Sidle et al., 2000), here, we observe that the timescale at which fluid is transported through the hillslope lags significantly behind the instantaneous response of subsurface flow rates and streamflow to the event pulse (i.e., celerity; Fig. 2) as evidenced by the transmission of the storm \u03b4D signal over the course of a few months in the vadose zone (Fig. 3). This observed difference is consistent with the \u2018old water paradox\u2019 (Kirchner, 2003) and is an important consideration for hillslope runoff generation with respect to the resulting distribution of fluid travel times (McDonnell and Beven, 2014) and thus the extent of fluid-rock interaction reflected by streamflow. Given that fluid was displaced from the interior of the actively weathering hillslope by infiltration of the storm, the interior structure and reactivity of the hillslope must be considered in interpretation of stream weathering signatures.\nWhile all water travels through the vadose zone to groundwater, the variable thickness of the vadose zone leads to different length scales and thus timescales of fluid transport through the system as a function of hillslope position. Vadose zone thickness is observed to correspond with the thickness of weathered bedrock, which tends to increase upslope (e.g., Rempe and Dietrich, 2018). This relationship means that locations higher up the hillslope show larger dynamic vadose zone water storage and thus require a larger volume of fluid to be refilled seasonally in order to trigger groundwater recharge (Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Schmidt and Rempe, 2020). As a result, groundwater levels where vadose zone water storage is smaller (i.e., downslope) respond relatively faster to rainfall (Salve et al., 2012).\nAltogether, our results imply a continuity in the hydrogeochemical system rather than a bypassing of the near-surface, where fluid stored downslope should represent a significant contribution to the stream during the storm. Given our interpretation of hydrological dynamics during the event, the fluid-rock reactivity from soil through vadose zone to groundwater remains relevant to the generation of geochemical signatures observed in the stream during this high intensity storm.\n\n\n4.2\nGeochemical evidence of continuity in reaction pathways\nIn subsection 4.1, we argue that hydrologic flowpaths from infiltration to vadose zone to groundwater to stream are maintained throughout an intense storm event. Now, we verify continuation in the geochemical reaction network during this storm event relative to ambient periods. First, the spatially and temporally homogeneous distribution of groundwater and Elder Creek 87Sr\/86Sr (Fig. S4a) indicates there is no detectable shift in the distribution of minerals undergoing dissolution and thus the flow path accessed by groundwater. This is based on the expectation that the dissolved 87Sr\/86Sr signature is inherited from the solid material(s) releasing solutes to water (e.g., Bullen et al., 1997; N\u00e9grel et al., 2018). Although sparser, the groundwater \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi data appear to similarly suggest a preservation of subsurface flow paths and associated secondary phase formation, maintaining the relative magnitude and pattern of increase in values downslope before and during the event (Fig. S4b). While there is some variation in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi within individual wells between the two sampling dates, we emphasize that there is no systematic trend, and we lack a sufficient record of temporal variation in the groundwater \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi to draw further inference from individual well variability. Furthermore, the wells are fully screened and therefore represent a mixture of depths below the water table, leading to some homogenization in these isotope ratios. Hence, we only use these observations to note that there is no systematic difference in the spatial pattern of this record across the duration of the storm. These inferences of invariant mineral dissolution and precipitation support the continuity of subsurface (bio)geochemical reactions that contribute to Elder Creek even during an intense storm event.\nNext, we consider whether a variable contribution from a distinct shallow-soil end member could offer a viable explanation of the stream \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi observations. This would follow the reasoning that the storm event promoted greater hydrological connectivity, and as a consequence, shallow water stores may have become preferentially mobilized, essentially bypassing the deeper subsurface. If true, we would anticipate \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signatures that are isotopically light, as is typical of shallow soil waters (Lemarchand et al., 2010), and could potentially explain the decrease in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signatures during the storm.\nA theoretical binary mixture between water equilibrated with shallow soil and water equilibrated with bedrock is produced by weighing each end member fraction by its respective Li\/Na ratio (Supplementary Text S3; Fig. S6). All parameter values are given in Table 2\n. While this mixing approach is capable of achieving the range of low Li*\/Na* values seen in Elder Creek during the storm (0.6-0.8 \u03bcM\/mM) using the soil water end member, it is unable to capture the high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi values (+26\u2030 to +29\u2030). Furthermore, although the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi of the bedrock-equilibrated water can be adjusted to represent the isotopically heavier groundwater previously observed at the site (+23\u2030 to +25\u2030), the lowest Li*\/Na* ratios that correspond to these samples are still greater than 2 \u03bcM\/mM (Golla et al., 2021). Overall, these results indicate that mixing between soil- and bedrock-equilibrated fluid end members, and thus transport processes alone, cannot explain the Li trends during the storm. Therefore, isotopically fractionating reactions that occur along subsurface fluid flowpaths must contribute to the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signature of Elder Creek during the storm.\n\n\n4.3\nToward coupled transport and reactivity\nDespite the magnitude of the storm event, very little change is observed in the major solute C-Q behavior (Fig. 4), further suggesting that the (bio)geochemical reactions that produce observed solute signatures in Elder Creek during hydrological quiescence are still in effect. This inference is supported by our combination of physical hydrologic observations, water isotope tracing, groundwater 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, and mixing model analysis, all of which suggest that the same basic routing of water through the subsurface and (bio)geochemical reactivity therein continue to apply during this storm.\nIf fractionating geochemical reactions are producing our observed \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi in Elder Creek, the relationship should be describable with basic models relating isotopic enrichment to reaction progress. Rayleigh models are widely applied for this purpose, and have been previously utilized in application to \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and other isotope systems in weathering environments (e.g., Dellinger et al., 2015; Fernandez et al., 2022; Georg et al., 2007). In the following functional form\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\ni\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n+\n1000\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\nl\nn\n(\n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n)\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n is the initial isotope composition of the fluid, \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n is the isotopic fractionation factor between the actively forming secondary minerals and the fluid, and \n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n is the fraction of Li left in solution. The value of \n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n is calculated by normalizing the Li*\/Na* ratio of the fluid to the Li\/Na ratio of fresh bedrock (e.g., Dellinger et al., 2015).\nFrom a starting point of \n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n=\n1.0\n (i.e., congruent dissolution), the Rayleigh calculation can be used for any given value of \n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n<\n1.0\n and an associated fractionation factor \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n. For our parameterization (Table 2), we recover the observed trend in Li*\/Na* and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi in the stream (Fig. 6\na) with an \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n=\n0.9898\n. The sensitivity of this result to the choice of \n\n\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\nN\na\n\n\n\n\nb\ne\nd\nr\no\nc\nk\n\n\n is explored in Supplementary Text S4. This \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n value is lower, or more \u201cmuted\u201d, relative to the typical range of values isolated in laboratory studies of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi fractionation during formation of common clays such as illite and smectite (e.g., Hindshaw et al., 2019; Vigier et al., 2008; Williams and Hervig, 2005). This apparent dampening of the isotopic fractionation factor could result from the compounding effects of multiple contemporaneous solubilization and precipitation reactions and\/or as a result of averaging over a distribution of flow paths (Druhan and Maher, 2017).\nFor our purpose, the key observation taken from the Rayleigh model (Fig. 6a) is that \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi values measured during the event show less reaction progress along the Rayleigh trend, indicating less geochemical evolution from a starting bedrock-equilibrated fluid value. In contrast, lower discharge values before the rising limb of the event show more enriched \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and lower \n\n\nf\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\nL\ni\n\n\n, suggesting more reaction progress. In total, this relationship suggests that during the storm subsurface fluid contributing to Elder Creek was less reacted, as would be associated with a faster mean subsurface fluid travel times.\nCertainly there are limitations to the applicability of a simple Rayleigh model, including the assumption that Li is only lost from solution from a starting point that is bedrock-equilibrated, rather than contemporaneous solubilization of primary minerals (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi \u2248 0\u2030) and formation of new secondary phases. To build upon this basis, we next utilize a batch-reactor model that considers the simultaneous effects of mineral dissolution and precipitation (Fig. 6b; Lemarchand et al., 2010)\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\ni\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n1000\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nsec-diss\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n+\n(\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n+\n1000\n(\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nsec-diss\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n)\n\u00d7\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n(\nL\ni\n\/\nN\na\n)\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n(\nL\ni\n\/\nN\na\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\n(\nL\ni\n\/\nN\na\n)\n\n\no\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n are the initial compositions of the fluid, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nL\n\n\ni\n\n\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n is the dissolution flux, and \u03bb is the ratio between the mineral precipitation and dissolution fluxes. Once again, the model simulates the reaction pathway from a bedrock-equilibrated fluid. In this framework, the Lemarchand et al. (2010) model is able to match the range of values observed in Elder Creek during the storm for a \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n = 0.975 (Table 2). This fractionation factor is more comparable to the range of intrinsic or laboratory-derived \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\ne\nc\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n of clays (\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ns\nm\ne\nc\nt\ni\nt\ne\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n = 0.9834 and \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\nt\ne\n\u2212\nd\ni\ns\ns\n\n\n = 0.976; Hindshaw et al., 2019; Williams and Hervig, 2005) that are predominantly forming at depth at this site (Golla et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2020).\nIn this framework, the decrease in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi observed during the storm is attributed to a decrease in the extent of secondary mineral precipitation (or a decreasing \u03bb coefficient). As in the Rayleigh framework, this result also suggests that the Li composition of Elder Creek during the storm was less geochemically evolved (from a starting point of bedrock-equilibrated fluid) than that before the rising limb of the hydrograph. In total, these simple modeling exercises demonstrate that isotopically fractionating geochemical reactions remain relevant to the interpretation of stream Li even during an intense storm. Furthermore, they suggest contemporaneous solubilization and precipitation of multiple mineral phases, which requires a multi-component numerical reactive transport simulation to be fully encapsulated. From this basis, we proceed with application of our previously validated 1-D reactive transport model framework for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signatures of fluids draining through the near-surface of this system (Golla et al., 2021).\n\n\n4.4\nApplication of a coupled reactive transport modeling framework to the stream \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signatures of a large storm\nOur previously established 1-D reactive transport model framework is designed to trace the evolution of Li and its stable isotopes through the Rivendell hillslope via an ensemble of silicate weathering reactions (primary mineral dissolution, clay solubilization, and clay formation; Supplementary Text S5; Golla et al., 2021). This framework is based on a vadose zone reactive transport model that simulates the interaction between infiltrating meteoric fluids and the modern-day regolith underlying the Rivendell hillslope. The model domain is partitioned into multiple distinct sub-domains in order to reflect the compositional gradient of the weathering profile (Wang, 2020) as observed in the solid-phase geochemistry and mineralogy (Gu et al., 2020). As a result, the model solid-phase profile varies chemically (Li\/Na = 4.5-10 mM\/M) and isotopically (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi = -12 to \u22120.57\u2030) with depth. Simulation of lateral drainage below the water table is initiated using the conditions taken from the base of the 1-D vadose zone model. The fluid in the saturated zone is allowed to continue geochemically evolving through time from this initial condition. Given the sensitivity of Li isotopes to the formation of secondary minerals (e.g., Huh et al., 2001; Pistiner and Henderson, 2003; Rudnick et al., 2004), we used \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi signatures of fluids from the VMS to further constrain the multiple-mineral weathering reaction network of the model, which was only previously calibrated by major solute observations (Wang, 2020). Further details about the parameterization and development of the model can be found in Supplementary Text S5 and Golla et al. (2021).\nAn important outcome of this previous modeling framework is the distinction between the vadose zone, which acts as net source of Li to the dissolved load, and the saturated aquifer, which acts as a sink of Li from the fluid. The Golla et al. (2021) model indicates that Li concentrations increase across the vadose zone by 0.87 \u03bcM and attendant Li\/Na increase by 9 \u03bcM\/mM. In contrast, 0.45 \u03bcM of Li is lost from groundwater as it transits from the upper hillslope to the toe, associated with a decrease in Li\/Na of 7 \u03bcM\/mM. Throughout the system, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi enriches as a result of the formation of multiple secondary mineral phases. This compartmentalization of Li source (vadose zone) and sink (saturated zone) across the hillslope is highly relevant to our analysis of stream chemistry, which serves as the terminus of these reactive flow paths.\nAs a new expansion of this previous approach, we run additional simulations to produce a solution space that encapsulates two factors. First, we simulate a range of vadose zone depths for further geochemical evolution in the saturated zone (Fig. 7\n). This may be translated into distinct locations along the hillslope, as the vadose zone becomes progressively thicker from toe to ridge. Each of these flow paths offers a representation of the typical extent of subsurface contribution to the dissolved Li load of Elder Creek as a function of distance upslope. Analyzing multiple flow paths in this way allows us to simulate the effects of the storm on subsurface drainage that emerge as a function of internal weathered bedrock thickness and vadose zone water storage capacity (subsection 4.1). In general, the saturated zone geochemical evolution initiates from higher Li\/Na ratios when sourced from a thicker vadose zone (i.e., further upslope). Secondly, from any given initial condition in the saturated zone model, the simulated trajectory of increasing \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and decreasing Li\/Na evolves with time due to fluid-rock reactivity, such that the value achieved at the terminus of the hillslope (i.e., the stream) is a function of the fluid flow rate. Analyzing flow rates in this way allows us to study the effects of changing subsurface fluid velocities in response to the storm event (subsection 3.1; Fig. 2).\nThe range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and Li\/Na taken from the base of our vadose zone model and used as initial conditions in our saturated zone model fall between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi = \u22128.7 to \u22126.1\u2030 and Li\/Na = 2.9-4.8 \u03bcM\/mM (Fig. 7). These compositions correspond to a vadose zone thickness ranging between 2 m (lower Li\/Na) and 4 m (higher Li\/Na), which is generally consistent with the thickness of weathered bedrock at the base of the hillslope (4 m; Rempe and Dietrich, 2018). This result suggests that a significant proportion of the Li that appears in the stream must be sourced from downslope, which is consistent with a greater response in the groundwater table downslope over the timescale of storm events (subsection 4.1; Rempe and Dietrich, 2018; Salve et al., 2012). A key point in this analysis is that all flow paths within the hillslope are routed to the stream and, hence, contribute to stream chemistry, meaning fluids that infiltrated further upslope are still present in streamflow during the storm. Some of the solubilized Li in these longer flow paths is lost to secondary mineral precipitation, as evidenced by continued enrichment in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi (Golla et al., 2021). What remains in solution mixes with Li sourced from further downslope and appears in the stream as a spatially integrated signal reflecting both flux weighting of fluid flow paths and the distribution of fluid-rock reactivity across the interior of the hillslope (Fig. 8\n).\nTo draw further inference from this model-data comparison, we partition observations taken during the storm from those at lower discharge rates prior to the rising limb of the storm (Fig. 7). During the storm, both \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and Li*\/Na* measurements are consistent with a combination of (1) deeper vadose zone depths and (2) shorter fluid residence times. This inference is supported by our model results. First, shorter fluid residence times in the groundwater produce lower \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi (inset in Fig. 7) due to less secondary mineral formation. However, the data observed during the storm show higher Li*\/Na* values (relative to those prior to the storm) than what can be produced in a single simulation simply by decreasing fluid residence time. Hence, an overall increase in subsurface flow rates is necessary, but cannot exclusively explain the shift in Li composition from low- to high-discharge conditions. In addition, the model requires a higher initial \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi and Li\/Na starting point, corresponding to a deeper vadose zone, in order to produce the shift in the stream data at higher flow rates during the storm.\nAs a consequence, the juxtaposition of our model with the observed \u03b4\n7Li and Li*\/Na* signatures of the storm event suggests a discernable shift toward a greater contribution of Li to the stream sourced from further upslope, where the vadose zone is thicker. As demonstrated by our process-based model, this change in provenance is coupled to an increase in subsurface flow rates. As the hillslope fills during the storm, groundwater flows faster towards the stream, and the rising water table accesses and mobilizes Li from the base of the vadose zone, leading to the delivery of overall less-reacted Li (lower \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n7\n\n\nLi, higher Li\/Na) from a larger source area (Fig. 8). Importantly, the chemical signatures recorded in the stream are a result of water-rock interactions that precede and are generated over timescales longer than that of the rain event (Golla et al., 2021). The perturbation imposed by the storm is merely shifting the relative contributions from the source (vadose zone) and sink (saturated zone) areas of Li within the hillslope. When treated in a reactive transport framework capable of describing multiple contemporaneous mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions, lithium isotopes recorded across the storm hydrograph offer the sensitivity necessary to disentangle the origin of rock-derived solute exports that ultimately produce C-Q relationships.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nThis study merges a wide variety of data and models to arrive at a coherent analysis of the export of rock-derived solutes by fluids draining through an actively weathering, upland hillslope during an intense storm and of the emergence of stream geochemical signatures across the storm hydrograph. An atmospheric river delivered an intense period of infiltration that combined with the shallow layers of a large volume of pre-existing rock moisture stored in the bedrock vadose zone above the water table. The displacement of this fluid caused the water table to rise and groundwater flow rates to increase, yet the underlying water-rock reactions producing rock-derived solutes within the interior of the hillslope remained consistent. Through a series of model exercises, we show that combined mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions are necessary to explain the \u03b4\n7Li data, ultimately supporting application of an isotope-enabled reactive transport model previously developed for this site based on long-term solute sampling and \u03b4\n7Li collected under low-discharge conditions.\nThe combination of our model results and physical observations demonstrates a clear sensitivity of Li signatures to changes in subsurface flow as the hillslope fills during a large storm event. These isotope ratios are sensitive to the thickness of the bedrock vadose zone through which fluid drains, which acts as source of Li to the fluid phase. This solubilized Li continues to geochemically evolve within the saturated groundwater, which acts as a net sink of Li from the fluid, as it transits the hillslope (Fig. 8). Ultimately, the Li isotope composition of Elder Creek recorded during this large storm provides a new lens within the characteristically chemostatic solute signatures of Elder Creek, revealing connectivity between subsurface structure and function and the geochemistry of streamwater under transient hydrological conditions. This conceptual model (Fig. 8) does not support shallow soil water or overland flow as predominant contributors to stream \u03b4\n7Li signatures during storm events. Rather, these findings open the opportunity to leverage models for the reactive transport behavior occurring within hillslopes (Golla et al., 2021). This study motivates consideration of how such balances should differ among solutes based on the distribution of element-specific source and sink areas within a given system.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJon K.

Across the CMB there is a transition from silicate to liquid iron, and an associated density jump of approximately 4000 kgm-3 (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981). The thermal gradient across this region is on the order of 1000 K (Lay et al., 2008). The region above the CMB contains a variety of heterogeneities that have been imaged with seismology. Long wavelength, degree-2, low seismic velocity anomalies have been robustly imaged using tomography atop the CMB beneath Africa and the Pacific, these are the Large Low Velocity Provinces (LLVPs; e.g. Lekic et al., 2012). Smaller scale anomalies on the order of 10 km tall and 100 km in diameter have also been imaged in seismic waveform studies using a variety of reflected, refracted and diffracted phases (Yu and Garnero, 2018). These exhibit velocity reductions on the order of 10% and 30% for P and S waves respectively (Yu and Garnero, 2018) and are termed ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs).\nThe origin of ULVZs remains enigmatic and several causal mechanisms are possible. Multiple studies have noted that ULVZs appear to be correlated with LLVPs (e.g. Yu and Garnero, 2018), as well as upwelling plumes and surface hotspot volcanism (e.g. Williams et al., 1998) although others have noted that the correlation may be weak or absent (e.g. Thorne et al., 2021). These potential correlations as well as high compressional to shear velocity ratios have been used to infer partial melt as a potential source (e.g. Williams et al., 1998). Iron enrichment is also a possible cause of ULVZs (e.g. Mao et al., 2006; Karato, 2014). These two scenarios are not mutually exclusive, and both melt and iron enrichment together might explain ULVZ observations (Liu et al., 2016; Dannberg et al., 2021). Present day melting, fractionation and separation of the lowermost mantle could result in an iron rich layer at the CMB (Stixrude et al., 2009) or the melt could originate from subducted slab material (Liu et al., 2016; Thorne et al., 2019). Another possible origin of ULVZs is that they are the remains of a basal magma ocean (Labrosse et al., 2007; Boukar\u00e9 et al., 2015; Pachhai et al., 2021).\nWhatever the origin, due to the preferential partitioning of iron into the liquid, melt at the CMB is expected to be dense relative to the background lower mantle (Stixrude et al., 2009; Boukar\u00e9 et al., 2015). In most cases, the melt would percolate downwards from ULVZs under gravity to form a thickening basal molten layer at the CMB, suggested to be inconsistent with seismic observations (Hernlund and Tackley, 2007; Dannberg et al., 2021). However, under certain conditions, the melt may be retained by ULVZs due to stirring (Hernlund and Jellinek, 2010). Furthermore, melt derived from slabs may react with the background mantle and solidify precluding the formation of large pockets of melt (Andrault et al., 2014). In specific locations, very thin ULVZs have been identified using high frequency P phases from nuclear explosions (Thybo et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2004) which are proposed to be as thin as 7 km and comprised of partial melt, potentially layered such that the base is a higher proportion of melt than the top. It is possible that such a basal layer may exist more extensively but lies below the limit of current seismic resolution.\nObservations of Earth's length of day, nutations and geomagnetic field indicate that the mantle and core are electromagnetically coupled (e.g. Holme, 1998; Buffett et al., 2002). Different models have been proposed to allow for this, including a conducting layer up to 100 km thick at the base of the mantle (Holme and De Viron, 2013) and a very thin layer of high conductivity immediately above the CMB (Buffett et al., 2002). Both scenarios require higher levels of conductivity than are observed for lower mantle compositions in experiments (e.g. Poirier et al., 1996). An iron rich layer above the CMB, such as the material which would drain from partially molten ULVZs, may satisfy the requirement of high lowermost mantle conductance.\nMelt above the CMB would be an anomalous reservoir that could explain certain geochemical observations; a basal magma ocean would form a highly differentiated geochemical reservoir with a unique geochemical signature (Labrosse et al., 2007; Coltice et al., 2011). It has been proposed that the resulting anomalies in nickel and helium have been detected in ocean island basalt generated by some mantle plumes (Herzberg et al., 2013). A basal magma ocean could also explain observed tungsten anomalies (Deng and Stixrude, 2021). Furthermore, melt at the CMB could facilitate the transfer of chemical signatures across the CMB, including tungsten (Mundl-Petermeier et al., 2020) and osmium (Brandon et al., 1998).\nIn this study we test the seismic detectability of a thin one-dimensional iron rich global melt layer. We produce synthetic waveforms simulating a global melt layer of uniform thickness and assess the impact that such a structure would have on the global seismic wavefield. We find that several CMB-interacting phases exhibit changes in amplitude or travel time due to a global layer of melt at the CMB. The travel time of one phase, PKKPdiff, is sensitive even to very thin melt layers. PKKPdiff is a branch of PKKP, where the phase also diffracts along the CMB. The travel time of a deeper diving PKKP phase, PKKPbc, is minimally affected by a global melt layer and a data set of PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential times could illuminate a global melt layer. Based on these findings, we construct and examine a global data set of PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential times in order to assess the presence of melt at the CMB.\n\n\n2\nSynthetic forward modelling\nSeismic parameters for an iron rich melt layer were calculated using BurnMan (Cottaar et al., 2014) using published elastic properties (Boukar\u00e9 et al., 2015). Our synthetic explorations are one-dimensional and use a melt that is 40% FeO and 60% MgO with a sharp upper boundary (velocity profiles in Fig. 1\n). Such layer could represent molten ferropericlase, which has been proposed as a potential composition of ULVZs (e.g. Muir and Brodholt, 2015). The melt is 33% slower in \n\n\nV\n\n\nP\n\n\n compared to the lower mantle and represents an end-member scenario, appropriate for assessing which seismic phases may sense such a structure. Melt layers of uniform thicknesses from 1 to 10 km were inserted directly above the CMB in PREM (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981). For these sharp-topped layers, only fully molten layers are considered as such a basal layer is expected to form under gravity even in the case of partial melt (Hernlund and Tackley, 2007; Dannberg et al., 2021).\nAs well as these sharp-topped and extreme melt layers, velocity profiles were taken from the output of a recent geodynamical model involving a presently melting lowermost mantle (Dannberg et al., 2021). The layer in this model forms of iron-rich dense melts, based on melting pyrolitic mantle following the model of Boukar\u00e9 et al. (2015). We take a representative profile through this layer away from upwellings and downwellings, from now on referred to as the \u2018dense melt\u2019 model. Dannberg et al. (2021) also test the theoretical case where initial melt is less dense than the solid. In this case melt does not accumulate along the CMB, and the strongest degree of melt occurs slightly above the CMB, from now on referred to as the \u2018light melt\u2019 model. Both models have a less severe velocity reduction from PREM (maximum -10% \n\n\nV\n\n\np\n\n\n) and have a gradual reduction in velocity with depth, lacking a discontinuity in velocity at their tops (Fig. 1).\nSynthetic waveforms were produced using AxiSEM (Nissen-Meyer et al., 2014) at 2 s dominant period and a source depth of 500 km. An explosive source was used for optimal computational efficiency, allowing simulations to be run at shorter period. This has the limitation that explosion sources do not produce S waves, and therefore only the effect on P waves is considered. Most notably an explosion source will not produce ScP, SmKS or SPdKS phases, which have conversions to P waves at the CMB and have been used in previous ULVZ studies (e.g. Brown et al., 2015; Thorne et al., 2021).\nAll major CMB-interacting P wave phases from 0 s to 2000 s and from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 epicentral distance were examined for the impacts of CMB melt layers on both amplitudes and travel times. The phases considered were Pdiff, PcP and all branches of PKP and PKKP. There were several differences found for all of these phases, however in this publication we will focus on the PKKP branches as these had the clearest and easiest to quantify differences when compared to the reference model.\nPKKP phases are P waves for their entire path that have two mantle legs and two outer core legs with a single underside CMB reflection. At most epicentral distances there are two branches of PKKP that turn in the outer core, the shallower diving PKKPab and the deeper diving PKKPbc. There is also a third branch of PKKP which travels through the inner core, which can be denoted as PKKPdf or PKIKP. As the epicentral distance from source to receiver increases, PKKPab begins diffracting along the CMB and this is known as PKKP diffracted or PKKPdiff. Due to its three CMB interaction points, a PKKPdiff wave can diffract at core entry point, bounce point, exit point or any combination of these. A PKKPdiff wave therefore has no defined ray path in the outer core. Example ray paths and sensitivity kernel created using MC Kernel (St\u00e4hler et al., 2016) at 5 s dominant period are shown in Fig. 2\n.\nThe impact of introducing a melt layer on PKKP branches and PcP is illustrated in Fig. 3\n. In this example the models shown are 5 km of sharp-topped melt and the dense melt model (waveforms for other models are shown in Section 1 of the supplementary materials). For the 5 km of sharp-topped melt, the clearest differences are the amplitude anomalies in PcP, PKKPbc and PKKPdf and the presence of post-cursors for these phases. These amplitude anomalies are not present for the dense melt and are a result of positive interference between multiple reflected arrivals from the layer top. Amplitudes are therefore sensitive to any reflective boundaries close to the CMB, and are not a certain indicator for the presence of melt. The most robust anomaly introduced by melt at the CMB is a delay in the arrival time of PKKPdiff at all distances, which can be clearly seen for both models.\nDue to uncertainties in source timing, location and depth, differential times are more robust measurements than absolute times. The arrival time of PKKPbc is not significantly affected by a global melt layer and therefore it is possible to use PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential times to constrain a melt layer. This makes PKKPdiff a preferable phase to other observed diffracted phases, such as Pdiff, which were delayed but lack convenient reference phases.\nThe synthetic traces are filtered between 1 - 3 seconds period and PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential times are measured by cross-correlating windowed envelopes of the synthetic waveforms centred on the PREM ray-theoretical arrival times. A residual differential time for synthetic waveforms is then defined as the difference between the differential times as measured in the case of a model with melt and differential times as measured for the reference model without melt:\n\n(1)\n\nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\nm\ne\nl\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\nr\ne\nf\ne\nr\ne\nn\nc\ne\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor the sharp-topped models, the average of the measured \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n is approximately constant with epicentral distance and increases approximately linearly with layer thickness (Fig. 4\n), corresponding to a greater than predicted time between the PKKPbc and PKKPdiff arrivals.

We construct and examine a global data set of PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential time measurements.\nAt shallow source depths, the depth phases of PKKPbc overlap with PKKPdiff. At 80\u00b0 epicentral distance (280\u00b0 major arc distance) and 350 km source depth, PKKPdiff and pPKKPbc are separated by over 15 seconds which is sufficient to prevent contamination of PKKPdiff with pPKKPbc. Therefore only events with source depth greater than 350 km were used. Events must have a large enough magnitude to produce detectable PKKPdiff arrivals but not so large as to have complex source time functions, restricting usable events to magnitudes in the range 5.8 < Mw < 7.5. Between 01\/01\/2000 and 01\/09\/2021 this gave a total of 315 suitable events.\nFor each event all stations were used for which a modified version of the TauP Toolkit in ObsPy (Crotwell et al., 1999; Beyreuther et al., 2010) predicted an arrival for both PKKPbc and PKKPdiff in PREM. Both phases arrive in an approximate epicentral distance range of 78\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 (255\u00b0 to 282\u00b0 major arc distance) where the lower bound is the ray-theoretical cut-off of PKKPbc due to the inner core boundary and the upper bound is the ray-theoretical cut-off of PKKPab where diffraction along the CMB begins.\nFor each station, we used the vertical component trace, removed the instrument response and filtered from 0.5 - 2 Hz. In several traces, both PKKPbc and PKKPdiff arrivals were visible in individual traces, however, cross-correlation is more accurate when there is less interfering noise. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, stations for each event were grouped into 2.5\u00b0 radius bins around each station to form a pseudo-array. For each array the envelopes of the traces for each phase were then windowed around the expected ray-theoretical arrival time in PREM and linearly stacked. Example stacked waveforms for a single event are shown in Fig. 5\n (example waveforms for other events are shown in Section 2 of the supplementary materials).\nThe stacked traces were quality controlled to remove stacks with weak or no arrivals. This gave a total of 12641 phase pairs from 217 events (Fig. 6\n). Accepted phase pairs span entire distance range with PKKPdiff arrivals observed as far as 79\u00b0 (281\u00b0 major arc distance), corresponding to a diffracted path length of over 25\u00b0.\nWhen applied to data, the equivalent of \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n is redefined as the difference in differential times as measured in data and as measured in the synthetic traces for a given model:\n\n(2)\n\nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nP\nK\nK\n\n\nP\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\nm\no\nd\ne\nl\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor each source-receiver pair with both phases accepted, \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n was calculated for a range of 1D models: ak135 (Kennett et al., 1995), iasp91 (Kennett and Engdahl, 1991), PREM and each melt layer model used in the synthetic modelling.\nIn order to attempt to reduce uncertainty caused by known velocity variations in the mantle, ray-theoretical mantle corrections using three different tomography models were implemented; the models used were: GAP-P4 (Obayashi et al., 2013), DETOX-P2 (Hosseini et al., 2020) and GLAD-M25 (Lei et al., 2020). Corrections were made down to 2850 km depth, as to correct to the CMB would involve imposing a single diffracted path for PKKPdiff. This also allows velocities immediately above the CMB to still affect \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n.\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nResults relative to 1D Earth models\nAll 12641 \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n measurements are shown in Fig. 7\na relative to PREM. Fig. 7b shows mean \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n relative to all models. For a model that is well fitting to the data, \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n would have a value of zero. A model with negative values indicates that the phases in the data are closer together than the model predicts, and positive values that the phases in the data are further apart than the model predicts.\nRelative to PREM, the data have a mean of 0.56 s and exhibit a scatter with a standard deviation of 0.72 s, which is substantial when compared to the anomalies due to thin melt layers. This scatter is sufficient that within one standard deviation several of the models remain a possibility, including PREM with no melt or PREM with between 5 and 8 km of melt at the CMB. The best fitting of the models tested would be PREM with 2 km of melt at the CMB. Both the light and dense melt models are also well fitting.\nThe different global reference models, PREM, ak135 and iasp91, produce different average \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n values and this is the result of differing velocity structure near the CMB and in the outer core. ak135 and iasp91 are slower both above and below the CMB when compared to PREM. Out of these three models, PREM fits our data set best, although ak135 is also possible within one standard deviation. It is important to note that for ak135 and iasp91 it is not possible to improve the fit by introducing melt at the CMB. No significant splitting is observed in PKKPbc waveforms (see Section 2 of the supplementary materials for more information).\n\n\n4.2\nThe effect of 3D mantle corrections\nFor the melt layers tested in the synthetic modelling, 2 km of melt in PREM is the best fitting model, although the scatter in the data prevents observation or exclusion of melt at the CMB. Results for data corrected using the 3D tomographic models are shown in Fig. 8\n and the means and standard deviations are shown in Table 1\n.\nThat mantle corrections can reduce the mean residual towards zero indicates that it is possible to account for some of the observed residual of the data set with modelled velocity variations in the mantle. Nevertheless within the scatter of the data after 3D mantle corrections with respect to PREM, it is still possible to have several km of melt at the CMB. For the best fitting tomographic model, GAP-P4, as well as for DETOX-P2, the best fitting amount of melt would be approximately 1 km with up to 5 km possible within one standard deviation. For both of these tomographic models, the light and dense melt models also fit within one standard deviation indicating that thicker but less extreme structures can also satisfy the data.\nThe distribution of the means and standard deviations of \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n for individual events is shown in Fig. 9\n. The majority of events have data that fall within a single azimuth range, although this is not always the case. The means are distributed above and below the mean of the data set as a whole, indicating variability in \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n with different geometries. The standard deviations are mostly lower than the standard deviation of the data set as a whole, indicating consistency within individual geometries and that the majority of the scatter in the data set is due to sampling the CMB along different geometries. There are several possible causes of this scatter including velocity structures that are not fully represented in the tomographic models; small scale CMB velocity heterogeneities (e.g. ULVZs); and CMB topography. The interplay of different structures means that it is not possible to attribute the scatter to a single cause. This study considers only a global melt layer, though we note that it is possible for local variation of melt thickness to be superimposed on such a layer and this would also contribute to the scatter.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nVisibility of melt to other seismic phases\nThe results of this study indicate that the CMB may not be a sharp boundary and that a thin intermediate layer of melt is a possibility within the scatter of the high frequency observations made in this study and the uncertainty in global 1D models.\nIn synthetic testing, PKKPdiff was the most robust and sensitive indicator of low velocities immediately above the CMB and thus it seems unlikely that other P phases would be able to illuminate melt at the CMB either. Reflected phases, for example PcP, show too much dependence on assumptions about the layer's upper boundary to identify any kind of melt layer, but are sensitive to discontinuities near the CMB as has been shown previously from high frequency applications to nuclear explosion data (Thybo et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2004). Simple P diffracted phases, e.g. Pdiff, lack a convenient reference phase for differential times, however may yield useful information through other methods. Other more complex diffracted phases such as P3KPdiff (one more bounce point than PKKPdiff) are a possibility, however, these will likely be more complicated to observe and have a similar sensitivity to PKKPdiff.\nIn this study, we have not considered S waves and thus they remain a possibility. S waves are expected to not distinguish a fully molten layer from the outer core, but would have sensitivity to a potentially partial molten layer, where the S velocities would be stronger reduced than the P velocities. However, S waves used for CMB studies are not routinely observed at periods comparable to those in this study. Sdiff phases (e.g. Cottaar and Romanowicz, 2012) are used to study ULVZs but observed structures are on the order of tens of km thick. The limit of sensitivity for SKS phases to a low velocity layer has previously been estimated at 10 - 15 km (Stutzmann et al., 2000). Nevertheless, with modern synthetic modelling and data processing methods, a re-examination of the sensitivity of S phases to thin CMB structures may be warranted.\nPhases that have energy converted between P and S waves, for example SmKS, ScP (e.g. Brown et al., 2015) and SPdKS (e.g. Thorne et al., 2021), have been used to study ULVZs at shorter period than standard S phases and are more likely to be able to distinguish a thin layer of melt than standard S phases. These phases remain a possibility in identifying a thin layer of melt or partial melt at the CMB but are not considered in this study.\n\n\n5.2\nSensitivity of \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\n to outer core structure\nDue to its ray path (Fig. 2), PKKPdiff is not only sensitive to the mantle, but also to the outer core. Fast and slow layers at the top of the outer core affect both PKKPbc and PKKPdiff travel times and therefore also \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\n. Synthetic results and discussion for a limited range of outer core models are given in Section 3 of the supplementary materials. In particular Figure S25 presents \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n results relative to all models tested and many of the outer core models are also acceptable within error. This highlights further trade-offs when interpreting structure above and below the CMB using \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\n. Despite this, as a phase not currently used in producing outer core models, PKKPdiff may prove useful for testing and refinement of models of the outer core.\n\n\n5.3\nImplications for core-mantle coupling\nA seismically invisible layer of melt at the CMB, if present, would have profound effects on geodynamics in both the mantle and the outer core, and for interaction between the two. For electromagnetic coupling between the core and the mantle, previous studies suggest a necessary lower mantle conductance of 108 S (Holme, 1998; Buffett et al., 2002). To simultaneously satisfy constraints from geomagnetic secular variation, length of day variations and diurnal nutations, such a layer must be very thin, on the order of kilometres thick. Electrical currents are limited to the skin depth of magnetic diffusion, which for diurnal nutations and a layer with conductivity 5\u00d7105 Sm-1 is approximately 200 m (Buffett et al., 2002).\nThe expected electrical conductivity of the lower mantle ranges from 100 - 101 Sm-1 from both laboratory experiments (Shankland et al., 1993; Katsura et al., 1998) and geomagnetic observations (Vel\u00edmsk\u1ef3, 2010), although for the post-perovskite phase it could be > 102 Sm-1 (Ohta et al., 2008). For iron in the outer core, electrical conductivity is on the order of 106 Sm-1 (Pozzo et al., 2012). Conductance, G, is linked to conductivity, \u03c3, by the thickness of a layer, t:\n\n(3)\n\nG\n=\n\u03c3\nt\n.\n\n\n\n\nThere is therefore a trade-off between layer thickness and conductivity. Assuming that the 108 S conductance requirement is met entirely by a layer with uniform conductivity, layers of 1 km and 5 km thickness would require electrical conductivities of 105 Sm-1 and 2\u00d7104 Sm-1 respectively. Thus the required conductivity of thin melt layers would be lower than the value of iron but higher than the value for silicates. These values are consistent with calculated values for ferropericlase under CMB conditions (Holmstr\u00f6m et al., 2018).\nThere is no requirement for conductivity to be uniform within the layer and a higher conductivity at the base, as may be the case in a layer with a gradual transition from melt to solid, could simultaneously satisfy the conductance and thickness constraints. Such a layer could have seismic properties similar to the geodynamical models tested that also fit the data adequately.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications for geochemistry\nA layer of melt at the CMB would be an important geochemical reservoir, potentially sampled by mantle plumes leading to chemical signatures recorded in ocean island basalts (Coltice et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2015). Melt at the CMB that is in equilibrium with the core could facilitate the movement of chemical anomalies from the core into the mantle, potentially explaining observed osmium (Brandon et al., 1998) and tungsten anomalies (Mundl-Petermeier et al., 2020) that have been associated with core-mantle interaction. Tungsten anomalies can also be produced in a crystallising basal magma ocean (Deng and Stixrude, 2021). A long lived primordial reservoir sampled by plumes could also account for other observed isotopic anomalies including helium (Williams et al., 2015), nickel (Herzberg et al., 2013) and neodymium (Boyet and Carlson, 2005).\nSuch a layer need not explain all geochemical observations attributed to deep mantle sources as other deep reservoirs, for example ULVZs and LLVPs, would likely be responsible for some observed signatures. Overprinting by recycled crust is a further complication and could account for some observed osmium anomalies (e.g. Baker and Jensen, 2004) and explain why helium and tungsten anomalies are not seen in plumes with strong recycled signatures (Jackson et al., 2020). The interplay of several deep reservoirs, including a seismically invisible one, and overprinting would be complex to disentangle in geochemical observations.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn summary we have, using synthetic forward modelling, demonstrated that PKKPdiff - PKKPbc differential times are a sensitive measure for identifying a potential melt layer at the CMB. We have constructed a data set of over 12,500 observations and measured differential travel time residuals using stacked envelopes. The data have an overall positive \nd\n\n\nt\n\n\nd\ni\nf\nf\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\nd\na\nt\na\n\n\n relative to PREM, although this can be reduced with mantle corrections where 1 km of melt is the best fitting of the models tested. Nevertheless the data exhibit a large amount of scatter, meaning that within one standard deviation of data, even when corrected for mantle velocity variations, between 0 km and 5 km of melt fits the data to within one standard deviation. We are therefore unable to robustly exclude or observe melt at the CMB using this method. As this measure was the most robust and sensitive found in the synthetic modelling with P waves, it is likely that a thin layer of melt at the CMB would be seismically invisible to P waves of comparable frequency. Some phases not considered in this study, for example SmKS, ScP and SPdKS, remain a possibility for identifying thin melt layers.\nWe therefore conclude that within present seismological constraints a thin layer of melt, on the order of single kilometres thickness, could be present at the CMB and be effectively seismically invisible. If this layer of melt exists, it would have profound implications for core-mantle coupling and for geochemistry, possibly satisfying a range of observations.\n\n\nData acknowledgments\nThe facilities of IRIS Data Services, and specifically the IRIS Data Management Center, were used for access to waveforms, related metadata, and\/or derived products used in this study.

The exact mechanism responsible for establishing this isotopic heterogeneity is debated, and selective thermal processing or size-sorting of presolar materials in the disk (e.g., Trinquier et al., 2009; Burkhardt et al., 2011; Steele et al., 2012), changes in the composition of infalling molecular cloud material (Nanne et al., 2019; Burkhardt et al., 2019; Jacquet et al., 2019), or a combination thereof (Ek et al., 2020) have been proposed. Regardless of their cause, nucleosynthetic isotope variations in meteorites have proven highly beneficial for establishing genetic links among and between meteorites and planets. For example, bulk meteorites exhibit a fundamental isotopic dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites, indicating that meteorite parent bodies formed in two spatially separated, but coexisting disk reservoirs. Within this framework, the NC reservoir is commonly associated with the inner Solar System, whereas the CC reservoir may represent the outer Solar System beyond the orbit of Jupiter (Warren, 2011; Kruijer et al., 2017; Morbidelli et al., 2022).\nA promising element for further study of the nucleosynthetic heterogeneity of the early Solar System is zirconium (Zr). As a refractory lithophile element, Zr is neither affected by volatile loss processes nor by core formation, meaning that the entire Zr inventory of a differentiated parent body is present in its silicate mantle. Moreover, Zr is almost entirely unaffected by cosmic ray induced neutron-capture or spallation processes, rendering any isotopic effects from irradiation by galactic cosmic rays negligible at the current analytical precision (Leya et al., 2003). As such, the Zr isotopic composition of bulk silicate Earth (BSE), bulk silicate Mars (BSM), and the silicate mantles of other Solar System bodies represent an integrated average over their entire accretion history and allow for determining the nature and origin of a planet's bulk building material. In particular, relating the Zr isotopic signatures of NC and CC meteorites to those of the BSE and BSM can provide information on the nature and origin of the building blocks and, ultimately, the formation mechanism of the terrestrial planets (Dauphas, 2017; Burkhardt et al., 2021).\nZirconium consists of five stable isotopes (90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr, 94Zr, and 96Zr). Of those, 91Zr typically shows no or only very small anomalies (e.g., Sch\u00f6nb\u00e4chler et al., 2005; Akram et al., 2015; Elfers et al., 2020), and 92Zr can host radiogenic ingrowth from 92Nb (Iizuka et al., 2016; Haba et al., 2021), such that the anomalies in the neutron-rich 96Zr are the most diagnostic when the commonly employed internal normalization to 94Zr\/90Zr is used (for a more in-depth explanation of Zr nucleosynthesis, we refer to Akram et al., 2013). Zirconium isotope heterogeneity has been shown for chemical separates of carbonaceous chondrites (Sch\u00f6nb\u00e4chler et al., 2005; Elfers et al., 2020), Ca-Al-rich inclusions (Akram et al., 2013), and some bulk carbonaceous chondrites (Akram et al., 2015). However, unlike the nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies for other elements, there does not seem to be a clear distinction between NC and CC meteorites in Zr isotopes, and their 96Zr signatures seem to partially overlap (Akram et al., 2015). Moreover, high-precision Zr isotope data are missing for many NC meteorites, with the exception of the recently reported anomalies in eucrites and angrites (Render and Brennecka, 2021) and Zr isotope data for Mars (Burkhardt et al., 2021). Hence, the collective Zr isotope dataset is so far incomplete and systematic Zr isotopic anomalies within the suite of NC meteorites have not yet been demonstrated. To assess whether NC meteorites exhibit systematic Zr isotope anomalies, and how these relate to the composition of the CC reservoir, Earth, and Mars, we present new high-precision Zr isotope data for a range of NC and CC meteorites, many of them not previously measured for Zr isotopes. The new data are used to assess whether there is an NC-CC dichotomy for Zr, to unravel the origin of Zr isotope variations among meteorites, and to constrain the origin and nature of the building blocks of the terrestrial planets.\n\n\n2\nSamples and methods\n\n2.1\nSamples\nThe samples of this study include a representative set of chondritic and differentiated meteorites from both the NC and the CC suites, most of which have previously been digested and chemically processed for Mo (Burkhardt et al., 2011; Budde et al., 2019), Ru (Hopp et al., 2020), and U (Goldmann et al., 2015) investigations. As such, one strength of the present dataset is the possibility of detailed comparisons of isotopic signatures in different elements from the same sample digestions (Table S2 in the supplementary information lists the elements investigated for each sample as well as the associated references). For several meteorite groups we report the first Zr isotope data: Rumuruti, Kakangari, CH, and CL chondrites, winonaites, acapulcoites, mesosiderites, and main-group (MG) pallasites, as well as three ungrouped achondrites from the NC and CC reservoirs (Table 1\n). This comprehensive sample set, together with the Zr isotope data for angrites, eucrites, and martian meteorites published previously (Render and Brennecka, 2021; Burkhardt et al., 2021), allows for the thorough assessment of any Zr isotope variations among NC meteorites and for identifying the differences between NC meteorites and Earth.\nIn addition, we also analyzed acid leachates from a sequential dissolution of \u223c16.5 g whole-rock powder of the CM2 chondrite Murchison, which have previously been analyzed for Os (Reisberg et al., 2009), Mo (Burkhardt et al., 2012a) and W (Burkhardt et al., 2012b), as well as Sr and Ti isotope anomalies (Burkhardt et al., 2019). Details of this leaching procedure are given in Reisberg et al. (2009) and are briefly summarized in the supplementary information (S1).\n\n\n2.2\nAnalytical methods\nZirconium was purified from new digestions and from high-field-strength element (HFSE)-cuts obtained from previous studies using established methods (Render and Brennecka, 2021; Burkhardt et al., 2021). In brief, the Zr-containing cuts were converted into 10 ml 12 M HNO3 for a first purification employing TODGA resin cartridges as outlined in Torrano et al. (2019). After loading, matrix elements were eluted with an additional 15 ml 12 M HNO3. Next, Ti and Fe were eluted with 10 ml 6 M HNO3 and 10 ml 3 M HNO3 before Zr was eluted together with Hf in 20 ml 3 M HNO3 \u2013 0.3 M HF. Following evaporation to dryness, samples were treated with concentrated HNO3, dried, and redissolved in 3 M HNO3 \u2013 1 wt% H2O2 to be loaded onto PFA shrink columns containing LN spec resin (100 \u2013 150 mesh) for further separation of Zr from residual Fe, Ti, and Hf (Bast et al., 2015). Finally, solutions were dried, treated with concentrated HNO3, dried again, and redissolved in 0.5 M HNO3 \u2013 0.01 M HF for measurement.\nThe separation procedure resulted in refined Zr cuts with Mo\/Zr < 1\u00d710\u22124, Ru\/Zr < 1\u00d710\u22124, Ti\/Zr < 0.1, Fe\/Zr < 0.01, Hf\/Zr < 0.02, and doping tests were conducted to confirm that these levels were substantially below those that can be accurately corrected. Predilutions of all samples were checked, and any samples exceeding acceptable levels for any element were processed through the second column again. Yields of the entire separation procedure were consistently >70%, and two procedural blanks processed through the same chemical purification procedure contained 150 pg and 340 pg of Zr, which is negligible given that \u223c150 ng of Zr are consumed per analysis.\nMeasurements were performed on a Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS in M\u00fcnster and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in combination with a Cetac Aridus II desolvating introduction system using a Jet sampler and H skimmer cone setup, as well as a Savillex C-Flow nebulizer with an uptake rate of 50 \u03bcL\/min. This setup resulted in intensities for 90Zr between 30 to 40 V for measurement solutions of \u223c200 ng\/g (corresponding to a total ion beam intensity of 5.5 to 8\u00d710\u221210 A), while oxide formation rates were adjusted to below 1.5% CeO\/Ce. Each measurement consisted of a 30 s baseline and 200 cycles of 4.2 s integration time with all Zr masses (90, 91, 92, 94, and 96) being monitored using 10\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\u03a9\n amplifiers, while isobaric interferences from Mo and Ru were monitored using 10\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\u03a9\n amplifiers on masses 95 and 99, respectively. In addition, mass 89 was monitored for potential interferences from doubly-charged Hf ions that correspond to Zr isotope masses; however, measured signals were always <1\u00d710\u22123 V and appeared more likely to be related to yttrium instead of 178Hf++ (the Faraday lineup of the Neptune Plus does not allow mass 89.5 to be set up as part of a Zr cup configuration). Since our doping tests showed that Hf\/Zr ratios up to 0.2 do not affect Zr isotope measurement accuracy and all samples had Hf\/Zr <0.02, we did not apply any corrections related to Hf\/Zr. Zirconium isotope data were corrected for mass-bias by internal normalization to 94Zr\/90Zr = 0.3381 using the exponential law. Here and throughout the manuscript we employ the \u03bc-notation, denoting parts per million deviations relative to terrestrial standard solutions. In the case of Zr, we use NIST SRM3169 as the bracketing solution standard, resulting in the example formula below:\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\nZr\n\n=\n[\n\n\n(\n\n\nZr\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n90\n\n\n\nZr\n\n)\n\n\nsample\n\n\n\/\n\n\n(\n\n\nZr\n\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n90\n\n\n\nZr\n\n)\n\n\nSRM3169\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n]\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe external reproducibility (2 \u00d7 standard deviation, 2SD) of our methods, as determined by 52 measurements from two digestions of the USGS rock standard AGV-2 processed alongside the samples is \u00b16 \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr, \u00b16 \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr, and \u00b118 \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr (Table S1). Individual meteorite samples were typically measured between 5-10 times, and results are reported as mean values of pooled solution replicates with their associated 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nZirconium isotopic compositions of rock standards and meteorite samples relative to NIST SRM3169 are shown in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2\n\n. The isotopic compositions of the terrestrial rock standards AGV-2 (andesite from Oregon, USA), BHVO-2 (ocean island basalt from, Hawaii, USA), and BCR-2 (continental basalt from Oregon, USA) are indistinguishable from one another and from the SRM3169 bracketing standard (Table 1). This demonstrates the accuracy of our methods and implies that the Zr isotopic composition of the NIST SRM3169 standard is indistinguishable from bulk Earth. Similarly, a companion study has shown that martian meteorites are isotopically indistinguishable in Zr isotopes, allowing for calculation of a mean isotopic signature for Mars (Burkhardt et al., 2021).\nMeteorite samples analyzed in this and the two aforementioned companion studies (Burkhardt et al., 2021; Render and Brennecka, 2021) generally exhibit \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr that are indistinguishable or very close (<5 ppm in most instances) to terrestrial Zr isotopic values, with only LEW 87232 (Kakangari chondrite, KC), aubrites, and angrites displaying hints of small deficits (<10 ppm) in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr (Fig. 2B). Such \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr heterogeneity could potentially be radiogenic in origin (Haba et al., 2021), complicating any interpretation of these small anomalies in terms of nucleosynthetic heterogeneity. Given that Nb\/Zr ratios were not obtained for all samples and that the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr variations are not or are only barely resolved within the external uncertainty achieved in this study, we do not attach significance to these relatively minor effects.\nIn contrast, isotopic signatures in 96Zr\u2014the most diagnostic Zr isotope\u2014reveal that Solar System materials are isotopically heterogeneous. Apart from a single winonaite sample and three individual enstatite chondrites, all meteorites investigated here show resolved and variable excesses in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr (Table 1, Fig. 1). The average \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr values of the NC chondrites are well defined and increase in the order EC < RC < OC < KC. The \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr anomalies in the NC achondrites span a range similar to those of NC chondrites and increase in the order aubrites < acapulcoites \u2264 mesosiderites \u2264 eucrites \u2264 MG pallasites \u2264 angrites. Both CC chondrites and achondrites exhibit consistently more anomalous \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr compared to their NC counterparts, similar to the higher proportions of neutron-rich isotopes in other elements, such as 50Ti and 54Cr (e.g., Trinquier et al., 2009) or r-process Mo (Budde et al., 2016).\nThe leachates of the Murchison meteorite reveal significantly larger isotope variation compared to the bulk meteorites (Table 1). The magnitude of the anomalies of a given leachate decrease in the order \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr > \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr > \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr. The isotope anomalies are well correlated (Fig. 3\n) and consistently decrease from large excesses in the earlier leaching steps (L1 to L3) to depletions in the later leaching steps (L4 to L6). These isotope systematics and the corresponding slopes in Zr isotope space (Fig. 3) are in excellent agreement with previous sequential acid leachate investigations of other carbonaceous chondrites (Sch\u00f6nb\u00e4chler et al., 2005; Elfers et al., 2020).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nComparison to previous studies\nThe Zr isotope data set presented in this study is the most comprehensive to date, including the first Zr isotope data for aubrites, acapulcoites, MG pallasites, and winonaites, as well as CL, CH, Rumuruti, and Kakangari chondrites. Furthermore, these data are more precise compared to most previous data, making it possible to resolve isotope anomalies for most NC meteorites relative to the terrestrial standard and one another. Our data are in overall good agreement with previously published Zr isotope data for several bulk meteorites, but there are also some notable differences, namely with regards to the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr anomalies in carbonaceous chondrites and the extent of \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr variations among meteorites. Compared to the results of this study, the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr anomalies of carbonaceous chondrites reported by Akram et al. (2015) tend to be smaller and partly overlap with the compositions of NC meteorites (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 in the supplementary information). By contrast, all carbonaceous chondrites investigated in this study have well-resolved \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr excesses of between \u223c90 and \u223c130 ppm. The cause of the disparate results is unclear at present but may be related to the higher precision achieved in this study. Moreover, the heterogeneous distribution of isotopically anomalous components, such as CAIs, could be a significant contributing factor to the observed isotopic heterogeneity between different aliquots of CC meteorites. For instance, the \u223c40 ppm \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr variations among the carbonaceous chondrites can be accounted for by the presence of up to \u223c5 wt.-% CAI, consistent with the observed CAI abundance in CV chondrites and the absence of CAIs in CI chondrites (Fig. 4\n). However, given the paucity of CAIs in CI chondrites, the heterogeneous distribution of CAIs alone cannot account for the \u223c70 ppm difference between the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr values for Orgueil determined by Akram et al. (2015) (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr = 24 \u00b1 22) and this study (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr = 89 \u00b1 18). We note, however, that the larger 96Zr anomaly obtained here is in line with the ubiquitous 96Zr excesses observed among carbonaceous chondrites and with the idea that the 96Zr variations among carbonaceous chondrites reflect the heterogeneous distribution of CAIs.\nWe are also unable to confirm a previously suggested \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr-\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr correlation for whole-rock meteorites (Akram et al., 2015). These authors observed that bulk meteorites plot along a \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr-\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr trend different than that of acid leachates from primitive meteorites; on this basis, they argued that multiple isotopically variable sources of s-process matter contributed to the early Solar System. In line with Elfers et al. (2020), we find no evidence for significant 91Zr isotope heterogeneity, as variability in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr of all meteorites investigated here is limited to <5 ppm, smaller than the external reproducibility of the measurements. This is consistent with the suggestion that the previously reported negative \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr anomalies of some bulk samples are analytical artifacts resulting from the use of a non-certified solution standard from Alfa Aesar (Akram and Sch\u00f6nb\u00e4chler, 2016; Elfers et al., 2020). To this end, we find resolved isotopic differences (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr = \u22122.5, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n92\n\n\nZr = \u22122.7, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr = 8.2) between an Alfa Aesar ICP solution and the NIST SRM3169 bracketing standard used here (supplementary information S2), supporting the suggestion that different synthetic solution standards may have distinct Zr isotope compositions.\nThe lack of resolvable \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr variation among bulk meteorites is consistent with the Zr isotope variations in the Murchison acid leachates investigated here: Using the slope and the negative intercept obtained from the linear regression in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr of the leachate data (Fig. 3A), we find that for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr \u2248 130 (i.e., the largest anomaly measured in this study) a \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr value of only \u223c2 ppm is expected. This is well within the uncertainty of our Zr isotope measurements and corresponds with the lack of significant \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n91\n\n\nZr variation among the samples of this study (Fig. 2A).\n\n\n4.2\nZr isotope dichotomy between NC and CC meteorites\nA key observation from the new Zr isotope data is that NC and CC meteorites have systematically different \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr signatures. Unlike in previous work, where NC and CC meteorites showed a continuum of compositions and partly overlapped in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr (Akram et al., 2015), the new data of this study reveal that CC meteorites are characterized by ubiquitous \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr excesses of >90 ppm, while NC meteorites all have \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr anomalies of <50 ppm (Fig. 1, 2). As such, Zr isotopes conform to the fundamental NC-CC dichotomy observed for several other elements (see summary in Kleine et al., 2020). Analogous to observations for other elements, the new Zr isotope data show that CCs are offset from NCs towards the isotopic composition of CV3 CAIs, corroborating that the CC reservoir is systematically offset from the NC reservoir in the direction of CAIs (Fig. 6, see also Fig. S2 in the supplementary information). On this basis, it has been suggested that the accretion disk initially had a CAI-like isotopic composition (termed \u2018IC\u2019 for inclusion-like chondritic reservoir), and late-infalling material with an NC-like isotopic composition caused the observed isotope dichotomy between the inner and outer Solar System by being preferentially added to the inner regions of the protoplanetary disk (Nanne et al., 2019; Burkhardt et al., 2019).\nSince in this model the isotopic composition of the CC reservoir results from mixing between two bulk disk reservoirs having distinct isotopic compositions, the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir should be similar for all elements, irrespective of the geo- and cosmochemical character of these elements. Thus, the new Zr isotope data of this study, and the observation that bulk meteorites display an NC-CC dichotomy for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr, can be used to test this prediction. The fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir, \n\n\nf\n\n\nNC\n\n\n, can be calculated by mass balance as follows:\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\nNC\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nCC\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nIC\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nNC\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nIC\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nCC\n\n\ni\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nNC\n\n\ni\n\n\n, and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nIC\n\n\ni\n\n\n represent the isotopic anomalies in the CC, NC, and IC reservoirs in a given isotope i. For refractory elements (Ca, Ti, Zr, \u2026) the isotopic composition of different meteorite groups within the CC reservoir is strongly affected by the admixture of CAIs (Fig. 4). To take this into account, the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir is most appropriately calculated by substituting \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nCC\n\n\ni\n\n\n with a CAI-free carbonaceous chondrite isotopic composition, which\u2014given their paucity in CAIs\u2014is best represented by CI chondrites (i.e., \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nCI\n\n\ni\n\n\n). For the isotopic composition of the NC reservoir (i.e., \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nNC\n\n\ni\n\n\n) we chose the average isotopic composition of NC meteorites for a given element with the uncertainty covering the entire isotopic range of the NC reservoir. However, the particular choice of \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nNC\n\n\ni\n\n\n in these calculations has little effect on the calculated \n\n\nf\n\n\nNC\n\n\n values; for instance, using the isotopic composition of ureilites, which have the most pronounced anomalies among NC meteorites, for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\nNC\n\n\ni\n\n\n leads to essentially the same results (Table S4). Lastly, the IC (\u2018Inclusion-like Chondritic\u2019) reservoir is defined by the average isotopic composition of CV3 CAIs (see Table S4 for a summary of all isotope values used in the calculations).\nAs displayed on Fig. 5\n, the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir calculated in this manner for several elements is generally between \u223c0.5 and \u223c0.7, suggesting that the CC reservoir contains 65 \u00b1 11% (95% conf.) NC material. This average includes lithophile (Ti, Zr) and siderophile (Mo, Ni) as well as refractory (Ti, Ca, Zr) and main-group elements (Cr, Ni). Similarly, the elements involved are of different nucleosynthetic origins, such as the Fe-group (Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni) and heavier elements (Zr, Mo, Ru). The approximately constant fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir for such a diverse range of elements indicates that the NC-CC dichotomy is unlikely to result from thermal processing of specific presolar carrier phases or the heterogeneous distribution of isotopically anomalous and chemically fractionated components such as CAIs. Instead, to a first order, this constant value is readily accounted for by mixing between two disk reservoirs with similar bulk chemical but distinct isotopic compositions. This observation reinforces earlier proposals that the NC-CC dichotomy results from a combination of disk-wide mixing (with cessation from Jupiter's formation or another drift barrier in the disk), accompanied by time-varied infall from an isotopically heterogeneous molecular cloud core (Nanne et al., 2019; Burkhardt et al., 2019; Jacquet et al., 2019).\nAlthough isotopic anomalies among meteorites and CAIs have been reported for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nFe (e.g., Shollenberger et al., 2019; Schiller et al., 2020) and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n84\n\n\nSr (e.g., Moynier et al., 2012; Fukai and Yokoyama, 2019; Charlier et al., 2021), our model currently does not include Fe and Sr isotope data. This is because the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nFe values of CC meteorites (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nFe range from \u223c+20 to \u223c+40, excluding CI chondrites; Hopp et al., 2022) overlap with the average Fe isotopic composition of CAIs (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nFe = 43 \u00b1 17, Shollenberger et al., 2019), and so calculating the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir based on Fe isotopes is inconclusive. The lack of clearly resolved Fe isotope anomalies in CAI compared to their host chondrites likely reflects secondary alteration on the meteorite parent bodies, meaning that the original \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nFe of the CAIs were likely larger (Hopp et al., 2022). For Sr, the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir cannot be calculated because presently available data do not show resolved \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n84\n\n\nSr differences between NC and CC meteorites (Fukai and Yokoyama, 2019).\nIn summary, isotope anomalies for elements of different geo- and cosmochemical character and distinct nucleosynthetic origin consistently show that the characteristic isotopic composition of the CC reservoir can be reproduced by admixture of \u223c65% NC material to a pre-existing disk having a CAI-like isotopic composition (the IC reservoir). For a refractory element like Zr, additional isotopic variations among CC chondrites may result from variable abundances of CAI. Interestingly, the two ungrouped carbonaceous achondrites investigated here show similar \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr signatures compared to CAI-bearing carbonaceous chondrites. As differentiated meteorites, they likely derive from parent bodies that accreted prior to the carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Thus, their elevated \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr either point to an early local enrichment of CAI or indicate that these achondrite parent bodies accreted in a region of the CC reservoir with a higher fraction of IC material.\n\n\n4.3\nIsotope heterogeneity within the NC suite of meteorites\nCombining the new Zr isotope data with isotopic signatures of other elements reveals significant isotope heterogeneity within meteorites of the NC group, forming well-defined linear correlations of nucleosynthetic anomalies (red solid lines in Fig. 6\n). These general features of the NC correlations have been described previously (Spitzer et al., 2020; Burkhardt et al., 2021), but so far, the correlations involving Zr were poorly defined, or not defined at all. For instance, the \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nCr vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n94\n\n\nMo vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr regressions for NC meteorites in Burkhardt et al. (2021) returned \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n values of 0.47 and 0.65, respectively, and no regression was possible for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n62\n\n\nNi vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr. With our new Zr isotope data, the \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n values for \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nCr vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n94\n\n\nMo vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr are improved to 0.83 and 0.80, respectively, and our \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n64\n\n\nNi vs. \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr regression yields an \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n of 0.86.\nImportantly, the isotopes used in Fig. 6 (\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n48\n\n\nCa, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n50\n\n\nTi, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nCr, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n64\n\n\nNi, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n94\n\n\nMo, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr, and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n100\n\n\nRu) belong to elements with variable condensation temperatures, and include lithophile (Ca, Ti, Cr, Zr) and siderophile (Ni, Mo, Ru) as well as Fe-peak (Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni) and higher-mass elements (Zr, Mo, Ru), making it highly unlikely for these elements to be hosted in roughly similar proportions in the same presolar carrier phases or dust components. Thus, the selective removal (or addition) of a single presolar phase\u2014for instance, by thermal processing in the inner disk\u2014and selective dust-sorting are unlikely explanations for the isotope heterogeneity in the NC region, as they would not be expected to result in the observed linear trends in multi-element isotope space. As such, although individual presolar grains such as mainstream SiC are an attractive candidate phase that could be responsible for some of the observed isotope variations (e.g., in Zr), the heterogeneous distribution of such components is unlikely to be the main driver of isotope variations among NC meteorites. Instead, the linear correlations in elements of variable geo- and cosmochemical nature or stellar origin are most easily accounted for by mixing two chemically similar\u2014but isotopically different\u2014components.\nAlthough both the NC-CC dichotomy as well as the isotope variations within the NC reservoir were likely generated by mixing between isotopically distinct bulk disk reservoirs, the mixing components involved must have been different. This is because the NC regressions shown in Fig. 6 point toward the CAI-like isotopic composition only in Zr, Mo, and Ru isotope space (panels E, F), whereas for plots of Fe-group elements vs. Zr (or Mo, Ru), the NC trends are almost perpendicular to the NC-CAI offset (panels A-D). This suggests that the origin of isotope heterogeneity among NC meteorites cannot be related to the admixture of CAIs or CAI-like matter, as is the case for carbonaceous chondrites, but must have a distinct or additional cause. Nevertheless, when only the Fe-group elements are considered, the NC trend points toward the composition measured for CAIs, suggesting that the NC trend may have been produced by the same mixing processes that also established the NC-CC dichotomy. These seemingly contradictory observations can be reconciled if one endmember producing the NC trend had CAI-like excesses in the neutron-rich isotopes of Fe-peak elements (i.e., high \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n48\n\n\nCa, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n50\n\n\nTi, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nCr, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n62\n\n\nNi) but was enriched in s-process nuclides (i.e., low \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n94\n\n\nMo and high \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n100\n\n\nRu), unlike most measured CAIs. This putative component has been termed \u2018s-IC\u2019 for s-enriched inclusion-like component (Spitzer et al., 2020); however, the origin of this component and how it relates to CAIs and the early disk reservoir having a CAI-like isotopic composition remains elusive. More work is needed to assess whether evidence for such an s-process-enriched component exists among the components of primitive chondrites. The results of this study show that Zr isotope measurements are a promising tool to search for this material, as Zr is abundant in various chondrite components and can readily be used to identify s-process enriched matter.\n\n\n4.4\nSpatial vs. temporal isotope heterogeneity in the early Solar System\nThe isotopic variations among NC meteorites could be either temporal or spatial in nature, or a combination thereof. For example, Schiller et al. (2018) and Frossard et al. (2021) argue for a temporal evolution in the isotopic composition of the protoplanetary disk during planetesimal accretion, based on Ca and Nd isotopes, respectively. Other studies have instead highlighted relationships between nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies in several elements (including Mo, Ru, and Nd) and heliocentric formation distance (e.g., Trinquier et al., 2007; Yamakawa et al., 2010; Burkhardt et al., 2011; Fischer\u2013G\u00f6dde and Kleine, 2017; Render and Brennecka, 2021). Zirconium isotopes represent a powerful tool to potentially distinguish between these two options, as nucleosynthetic anomalies of lithophile elements in the silicate mantles of planetary materials are unlikely to have been overprinted by late-stage impacts, as could be the case for the siderophile elements Mo and Ru. To distinguish between a temporal and spatial isotopic heterogeneity, we first review available parent body accretion ages for NC meteorites analyzed for Zr isotopes in this study, and then assess whether systematic isotopic differences exist between samples from early- and late-formed parent bodies, which would be expected if the NC trend reflects temporal variations.\nThe parent bodies of differentiated meteorites are thought to have formed very early in Solar System history, when the short-lived radionuclide 26Al was still sufficiently abundant to have facilitated partial melting and planetary differentiation (Hevey and Sanders, 2006). This is consistent with parent body accretion ages of <1 Ma after CAI formation determined for differentiated meteorites such as iron meteorites, angrites, and eucrites (see summary in Spitzer et al., 2020 and references therein). For other differentiated meteorites, including the aubrites, mesosiderites, and MG pallasites, parent body accretion ages are less well known. Based on thermal modeling the accretion age of the aubrite parent body has been estimated to be <1.5 Ma after CAI formation (Sugiura and Fujiya, 2014). Mesosiderites and pallasites likely formed by collisional mixing of metal and silicate from different bodies, and so it is reasonable to assume that the accretion ages of these progenitor bodies were similar to those of other differentiated meteorites, i.e., <1 Ma after CAI formation. Another important group of meteorites are primitive achondrites\u2014such as the acapulcoites\/lodranites and winonaites\u2014which are thought to derive from parent bodies that underwent only partial differentiation. On the basis of thermochronological data and thermal modeling, the accretion age of the acapulcoite-lodranite parent body has been estimated to be 1.7\u00b10.3 Ma after CAI formation (Touboul et al., 2009; Neumann et al., 2019), suggesting that this object formed later than the parent bodies of fully differentiated meteorites. The accretion age of the winonaite parent body is less well known, but based on the undifferentiated nature of winonaites and the only small degree of incipient melting an accretion age of \u223c1.8 Ma after CAI has been estimated, with no uncertainty given on this estimate (Hunt et al., 2017). Finally, accretion ages for NC chondrite parent bodies have been constrained either through ages of chondrules or the combination of thermochronological data and thermal modeling. For instance, the chondrule ages from the most primitive ordinary chondrites suggest a parent body accretion age of 1.8\u00b10.1 Ma after CAI formation (Pape et al., 2019), consistent with thermochronological data (e.g., Edwards and Blackburn, 2020) and thermal modeling (e.g., Henke et al., 2012). For enstatite chondrites no chondrule ages are available, but thermochronological data suggest an accretion age of 1.95\u00b10.15 Ma after CAI formation (Trieloff et al., 2022). For Rumuruti and Kakangari chondrites no chronological data are available to evaluate parent body accretion ages, but given their undifferentiated nature it is reasonable to assume that they, like the enstatite and ordinary chondrites, formed at about 2 Ma after CAI formation, when the abundance of 26Al was too low to cause melting.\nIf temporal changes were mainly responsible for isotopic heterogeneity within the suite of NC meteorites, one would expect to see a trend between \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr and formation age, with a gradual change in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr values from early-formed differentiated samples, followed by partially differentiated (i.e., primitive) achondrites, and then later-formed chondritic samples. However, in contrast to these expectations, we here find that differentiated meteorites like aubrites and angrites collectively span a range from 15 to 50 in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr, which is indistinguishable from that occupied by enstatite, ordinary, Rumuruti, and Kakangari chondrites that formed later in Solar System history (Fig. 7\n). Winonaites and acapulcoites-lodranites, which both derive from parent bodies that accreted later than those of the fully differentiated achondrites but probably slightly earlier than the chondrite parent bodies, also exhibit a similar range in \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr from 2 to 33 (Fig. 7). Hence, it seems unlikely that temporal changes (alone) are responsible for the isotope heterogeneity observed among NC meteorites. Instead, the data presented in this work support the interpretation that the heterogeneous distribution of isotopically anomalous matter in the protoplanetary disk primarily occurred on a spatial level. Nevertheless, isotopic variations among the early-formed parent bodies of differentiated NC meteorites may still reflect temporal changes related to a rapidly changing composition of the disk during infall (Spitzer et al., 2020; Morbidelli et al., 2022). This hypothesis is difficult to test, however, because the inferred parent body accretion ages of these objects are all <1 Ma after CAI formation and their accretion ages are not resolved from each other.\n\n\n4.5\nThe role of meteorite parent bodies in constructing the terrestrial planets\nNucleosynthetic isotope anomalies provide a powerful tool for reconstructing the origin and nature of the terrestrial planets' building materials, which in turn is key for constraining the dynamic processes by which planets formed. In the classic accretion model, the terrestrial planets grow by the collisions among Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos and planetesimals from the inner Solar System, with only little contribution from outer Solar System objects scattered into the inner disk during the growth and migration of the giant planets (e.g., Chambers and Wetherill, 1998; Raymond and Izidoro, 2017). Previous work has shown that this formation model is consistent with the isotopic composition of Earth and Mars, which can be reproduced by a combination of inner Solar System bodies with only minor contribution of CC bodies from the outer Solar System (Dauphas, 2017; Burkhardt et al., 2021). However, an alternative model has been proposed, in which the terrestrial planets grow by accreting large amounts of pebbles from the outer Solar System which drift sunward through the disk because of gas drag (e.g., Ormel and Klahr, 2010). By looking at just a subset of elements, namely Ca and Fe, it has been suggested that this model is consistent with nucleosynthetic isotope signatures (Johansen et al., 2021), because the isotope compositions of these elements may be interpreted to indicate a large fraction of CC material (\u223c40 % by mass) in Earth and Mars (Schiller et al., 2018, 2020). Other work has shown, however, that a large fraction of CC material in Earth and Mars is inconsistent with the isotopic signatures of other Fe-group elements such as Ni and Cr (Hopp et al., 2022). Moreover, by simultaneously considering all elements for which nucleosynthetic isotope heterogeneity exists at the bulk scale, Burkhardt et al. (2021) showed that Earth and Mars incorporated only a small fraction of CC material, which is inconsistent with a pebble accretion origin for these planets.\nThe disparate conclusions drawn from nucleosynthetic isotope signatures highlight a fundamental problem when using isotope anomalies to reconstruct terrestrial planet formation, namely the issue of whether meteorites are representative of the material that built the planets. Previous work has shown that Earth is enriched in s-process matter relative to most meteorites, which is most clearly seen for Mo (Burkhardt et al., 2011; Budde et al., 2019) but also for Nd (Burkhardt et al., 2016) and Ru (Fischer\u2013G\u00f6dde and Kleine, 2017). Unlike the siderophile elements Mo and Ru, which record the late stages of terrestrial planet growth (Dauphas, 2017), Zr, as a lithophile element, provides information on the heritage of all the material accreted by Earth over its entire growth history. This makes Zr ideally suited to assess the origin and nature of the bulk building material of the terrestrial planets. As previous Zr isotope studies found no resolvable variations among NC meteorites, or between Earth and enstatite chondrites (Akram et al., 2015), Zr isotopes had been of limited use for characterizing the building material of Earth. However, with our increased precision, we not only find Zr isotope variations among NC meteorites but also show that enstatite chondrites are characterized by s-process deficits compared to Earth, in good agreement with isotope studies of other elements (e.g., Burkhardt et al., 2016; Fischer\u2013G\u00f6dde and Kleine, 2017; Render et al., 2017). At the current analytical precision, only winonaites appear to exhibit Zr isotopic compositions indistinguishable from the BSE, but given their isotope anomalies in other elements (e.g., Schiller et al., 2015), winonaites are an unsuitable match as the primary potential terrestrial building blocks. Thus, the terrestrial Zr isotope signature demonstrates that the average building material of Earth as a whole, and not only its late-stage building blocks, was enriched in s-process matter compared to meteorites. Considering the previously highlighted relationship between nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies and (presumed) heliocentric distance (Yamakawa et al., 2010; Burkhardt et al., 2011; Fischer\u2013G\u00f6dde and Kleine, 2017; Render and Brennecka, 2021), this s-process-enriched building material most likely is from the innermost Solar System (Burkhardt et al., 2021).\nA corollary of this observation is that meteorites alone cannot be used to identify Earth's building material, even for elements for which the terrestrial isotopic composition lies within the range of meteorite compositions. For instance, it has been suggested that Earth consists of \u223c40% CC material because the BSE's isotopic composition for the Fe-peak elements (48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr\u2026) is intermediate between NC and CC meteorites (Schiller et al., 2018, 2020). However, as demonstrated in Fig. 6, in each of the multi-elemental panels the BSE occupies an endmember isotopic composition on the NC trend, exhibiting not only the most neutron-rich (for Fe-peak elements) but also the most s-enriched (for higher-mass elements) composition within the NC reservoir. Consequently, the BSE's isotopic signature for Fe-group elements (i.e., more elevated \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n48\n\n\nCa, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n50\n\n\nTi, \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n54\n\n\nCr etc. compared to NC meteorites) does not reflect the addition of CC material from the outer Solar System, but a larger contribution of the s-process-enriched building material from the inner Solar System. This example highlights the severe limitations that may result from only considering isotope anomalies for Fe-group elements to identify the nature and origin of Earth's building material.\nThe overall s-process-enriched nature of Earth makes elements exhibiting s-process variations particularly important for reconstructing Earth's accretion history. With the new Zr isotope data of this study, there is now a comprehensive data set for three elements (Zr, Mo, Ru), which not only are characterized by s-process variations among Solar System materials, but also exhibit distinct geochemical behavior. As such, these three elements record different stages of Earth's accretion, where Zr provides an integrated signature of Earth's entire accretion while Mo records the last 10-20% and Ru the last \u223c0.5% (i.e., the late veneer) (Dauphas, 2017). Thus, the observation that BSE plots within uncertainty of the NC trends in Mo-Zr and Ru-Zr isotope space indicates that the provenance of Earth's building material has not changed significantly as accretion proceeded. This and the observation that BSE is not offset from the NC trends towards the CC reservoir demonstrates that CC meteorites cannot have contributed significantly to the growth of the terrestrial planets. This is consistent with previous suggestions of only \u223c4% by mass of CC material in bulk Earth and is also consistent with a similarly low fraction of CC materials inferred of Mars (Burkhardt et al., 2021). Recently published Zn isotope data appear to confirm such limited CC fractions and indicate that outer Solar System contributions likely happened late in Earth's accretion history (Savage et al., 2022; Steller et al., 2022). Collectively, the currently available inventory of isotope data in all elements therefore precludes a pebble accretion scenario for the formation of the terrestrial planets.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nNew Zr isotope data for a broad set of differentiated and undifferentiated meteorites of both NC and CC pedigree reveal that nearly all samples\u2014including enstatite chondrites\u2014exhibit resolvable excesses in 96Zr relative to terrestrial Zr. Meteorites from the CC reservoir are consistently more anomalous compared to NC meteorites, demonstrating that the NC-CC isotope dichotomy previously described for other elements also includes Zr isotopes. Furthermore, meteorites within the NC suite exhibit \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr variation that is correlated with isotope anomalies in other elements. Given the differences in nucleosynthetic provenance, as well as geo- and cosmochemical character of the elements involved, this argues against thermal processing and selective dust-sorting in the disk as the main responsible cause for generating this planetary-scale isotope heterogeneity, both for the formation of the NC-CC dichotomy and the correlated isotope variations among NC meteorites. Instead, this isotope heterogeneity is readily explained as the result of mixing isotopically distinct reservoirs with (near-) solar chemical compositions, where this mixing likely occurred during infall from an isotopically heterogeneous molecular cloud core during the early stages of disk building. Within this framework, the isotopic composition of the CC reservoir can be accounted for by late-stage infall of NC-like material onto a pre-existing disk having a CAI-like isotopic composition, with mass balance calculations suggesting that the fraction of NC material in the CC reservoir is \u223c0.65, for Zr and all other elements exhibiting the NC-CC dichotomy. The correlated isotope variations among NC meteorites may likewise reflect mixing during infall, but the origin of the mixing endmembers involved is less well understood.\nThe consistent excesses of \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n96\n\n\nZr throughout all studied meteorite groups imply that Earth is overall enriched in s-process isotopes compared to known meteorites and that our meteorite collections are lacking a substantial component of the terrestrial building material. Meteorites of CC pedigree appear to have not been involved in the accretion histories of the terrestrial planets to a significant degree, which indicates formation of the terrestrial planets from material of the inner Solar System and argues against formation by pebble accretion.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJan Render: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Phylogenetically diverse microbial communities can inhabit deep continental reservoirs hosted in bedrock fracture networks that extend to depths of >3 km below Earth's surface (Onstott et al., 2003; Sheik et al., 2021). Due to physical isolation imposed by a hydrologic disconnect from surficial waters, nutrients and carbon in these environments can be scarce (Holland et al., 2013). Nonetheless, microorganisms that adapt to these conditions can reproduce and maintain key cellular functions (Lever et al., 2015).\nSuccessful microbial energy production in the isolated subsurface hinges on utilizing available geochemical electron donors and acceptors. These oxidation-reduction (redox) couples are mediated by water and rock interactions and microbial metabolic activity. Long-term chemical reactions between water and rock in Precambrian bedrock yield high density, anoxic brines rich in calcium (Ca2+) and chloride (Cl\u2212) (Frape et al., 1984). Due to a lack of dissolved free molecular oxygen (O2), redox reactions in these fluids require alternative oxidants (e.g., SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n, Fe3+) to function as electron acceptors. In contrast, electron donors are readily available in Precambrian Shield brines in the form of C1-C4 alkanes (Sherwood Lollar et al., 1993a), more complex organics such as acetate (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2021), and H2 (Li et al., 2016). Significant quantities of alkanes such as methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), i-butane (i-C4H10), and n-butane (n-C4H10) are emitted from boreholes drilled into deep mines in the Canadian Shield (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002), Fennoscandian Shield (Nurmi et al., 1988), and South African Shield (Ward et al., 2004). These sites host ancient brine-filled reservoirs with mean residence times spanning tens of thousands to billions of years (Holland et al., 2013).\nThe formation of C1-C4 alkanes in any natural system can be linked to three processes: the biological reduction of carbon to CH4 (i.e., methanogenesis), the thermal degradation of organic matter (i.e., thermogenesis), and the abiotic polymerization of C-H bonds through catalytic reactions such as Fischer-Tropsch-type (FTT) synthesis (i.e., abiogenesis) (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; McCollom and Seewald, 2007). As such, distinguishing the production pathway(s) of C1-C4 alkanes in low-temperature systems is complex because measured abundances reflect the net effect of carbon cycling and isotopic exchange through microbial manipulation and mixing of thermogenic and\/or abiotic sources (Reeves and Fiebig, 2020). Each of these mechanisms has been invoked as the origin of C1-C4 alkanes in Precambrian Shield sites (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Ward et al., 2004).\nThe Soudan Underground Mine State Park, MN, USA, contains a high salinity, anoxic reservoir hosted in Neoarchean (>2.5 Ga) bedrock (Hudak et al., 2016) that provides an opportunity to investigate the controls on the habitability of the deep continental crust. Three legacy boreholes on the 27th level (713.5 meters below the surface) tap the reservoir and act as conduits for gas and fluid. First, we identify possible energy sources that may support microbial communities hosted in Soudan's anoxic brines. Favorable reactions for extant microbial communities are quantified using a thermodynamic approach applied to our measured compositions. Second, we discuss the formation mechanisms that produce C1-C4 alkanes in the system. Our study on biogeochemical cycling at the Soudan Mine will aid in resolving habitability constraints for Earth's continental subsurface. It will also provide a baseline for processes occurring in analogous bedrock fracture systems on other planets, such as the subsurface of Mars.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting\nThe Soudan Underground Mine State Park is located in the southwest region of the Superior Craton in northern Minnesota's Vermilion District. The Vermilion Greenstone Belt, on the western end of the Wawa-Abitibi Terrane, hosts the Ely Greenstone Formation, Lake Vermilion Formation, and the Soudan Iron Formation (Hudak et al., 2016), the latter extending through the 27th level west drift of the mine 713.5 meters below the surface. The bedrock is composed of Neoarchean (>2.5 Ga) hematite\/jasper banded iron formation (BIF) interlayered with hydrothermally altered basaltic flows (Thompson, 2015) consisting of chlorite schist and massive hematite ore. Our study was conducted \u223c650-800 m down the 27th level west drift at three slightly angled downward legacy boreholes. The three borehole orifices are spaced approximately 50 m apart and extend to depths of 102-144 m below the mine floor (\nFig. 1\n\n). Each borehole taps a saline fluid-filled fracture network and emits fluid and gas at the surface of the drift. Diamond drilled holes (DDH) DDH951 and DDH932 intersect large bodies of chlorite schist with minimal Fe-bearing deposits. The most western borehole in this study, DDH944, consists of shallow potions of BIF with hematite ore at deeper depths (Schuler et al., 2022).\n\n\n3\nMaterials and methods\n\n3.1\nSample collection\nGas samples were collected by submerging an inverted beaker equipped with a rubber septum at the mouth of each borehole, displacing the beaker volume with upwelling brine and allowing gas to collect. Gases were transferred into previously evacuated 30 mL borosilicate glass vials using plastic syringes and over-pressured to approximately triple the volume of the vessel. Borosilicate vials prepared for alkanes (CH4, C2H6, C3H8, i-C4H10, n-C4H10) and inorganic gases (H2, N2, Ar, O2, He) were pretreated with HgCl2, evacuated to at least 60 mTorr vacuum, and sealed with NaOH-boiled blue butyl rubber stoppers. Vials for CO2(g) were prepared similarly but sealed with black butyl rubber stoppers.\nAqueous samples were collected with a pre-cleaned, autoclaved stainless steel and silicone packer system (\nFig. 1\n) deployed in the top 1-2 m of each borehole. Each packer was inflated to seal off the borehole and minimize atmospheric contamination. Temperature, conductivity (mS), and pH were determined with an Oakton\u00ae handheld probe calibrated with NIST-traceable conductivity and pH standards. Aliquots for dissolved inorganic carbon (\u2211CO2(aq)\u202f=\u202fCO2(aq)\u202f+\u202fHCO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n(aq)\u202f+\u202fCO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n(aq)) were stored in evacuated borosilicate glass vials and sealed with black butyl rubber stoppers. The \u2211CO2(aq) samples were then acidified with H3PO4 to a pH <2.

Aliquots for solvent extractable organic analysis were stored frozen in fired 1 L glass bottles.\nWater samples for major anion (Cl, Br, SO4) and cation (Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, Sr) analyses were collected in sterile syringes and filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm PES membranes into 50 mL plastic sample tubes. Cation samples were preserved with 10 \u03bcL 12 M hydrochloric acid per mL of solution. Water samples were stored on ice after collection, then transferred to 5\u00b0C storage until analysis.\n\n\n3.2\nAnalytical methods\nA Hewlett Packer 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) was used to quantify CH4, C2H6, C3H8, i-C4H10, and n-C4H10 with a Supelco 80\/100 Porapak Q 6 ft x 1\/8 in x 2.1 mm stainless steel column. A He carrier gas was set to a pressure of 20 psi while FID H2 and zero air pressures were set to 29 psi and 37 psi, respectively. The oven was set to an initial temperature of 30\u00b0C with a 2-minute hold time, followed by heating with a temperature ramp of 12\u00b0C per minute to hold at a final temperature of 220\u00b0C for 2 minutes. Inorganic carbon abundances, including CO2(g) and \u2211CO2(aq) were quantified on a Hewlett Packer 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) with a Supelco 80\/100 Porapak Q 6 ft x 1\/8 in x 2.1 mm stainless steel column and a He carrier gas set at 20 psi. The oven was held at an isothermal temperature of 30\u00b0C. Inorganic gases, H2, N2, Ar, O2, and He were quantified with an Agilent 7890B GC-TCD. An HP-Molesieve 30 m x 0.320 mm x 25 \u03bcm column was used with a He carrier gas at 2.5 mL\/min to quantify O2, N2, and Ar at an isothermal temperature of 40\u00b0C for 10 minutes. N2 carrier gas was used at 1.5 mL\/min to quantify H2 and He at an isothermal temperature of 40\u00b0C for 10 minutes with the same column. All gas samples were run in triplicate with uncertainties (2\u03c3) of \u00b15% for CH4, C2H6, C3H8, n-C4H10, CO2(g), and N2, and \u00b110% for i-C4H10, H2, O2, He, and Ar.\nConcentrations of \u2211NH\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n(aq) were determined by flow injection analysis (see SI for additional details). Samples were run in triplicate with uncertainties (2\u03c3) of \u00b15%. MMA, DMA, TMA were quantified by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) via headspace extraction (see SI for additional details). Samples were run in triplicate with uncertainties (1\u03c3) of \u00b110%.\nStable isotope ratios are expressed in \u03b4 notation in per mil units (\u2030); e.g., for carbon:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n=\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nsample\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nR\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nstandard\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\u00d7\n1000\n(\n\u2030\n)\n\n\n where Rsample and Rstandard are the isotope ratios (13C\/12C) of both the sample and standard.

All anion measurements had a relative standard deviation less than 2%. Major cations were measured in triplicate on a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6500 ICP-OES using a Mira Mist PEEK nebulizer. Yttrium was used as a standard to monitor internal consistency. All major cation measurements had a relative standard deviation less than 5%.\n\n\n3.3\nGeochemical modeling\nThermodynamic calculations were performed to assess the affinity for potential chemical reactions occurring in the mine waters. The affinity, as expressed by the Gibbs Free Energy of a given reaction (\u0394G), determines which reactions are exergonic and thus, reflect potential metabolic pathways for microorganisms. In this study, the \u0394G values of candidate metabolic reactions were assessed for each of three legacy boreholes using measured aqueous abundances and calculated activity coefficients, as described below. The sign of each \u0394G value (in kJ\/mole units) can be used to determine whether a chemical reaction can proceed spontaneously. If a \u0394G value is negative, the forward reaction is favorable (i.e., exergonic). If a \u0394G value is positive, the reverse reaction is favorable (i.e., endergonic). A \u0394G value of zero, or near-zero, identifies a reaction at or near equilibrium.\nMeasured and dissolved volatile abundances, and water and gas flow rates, were used to calculate dissolved concentrations of volatiles in fluids, for use in \u0394G calculations. The legacy boreholes sampled at the 27th level west drift are characterized by fluid and gas geochemistry that is relatively stable on the timescale of years (Schuler et al., 2022); therefore, \u0394G calculations combine several measurements from multiple sampling trips and boreholes. For example, the abundance of \u2211CO2(aq) was not determined for samples collected in February 2019, so an average of the \u2211CO2(aq) abundance measured at DDH932 and DDH951 in November 2019 was assumed for DDH944. Furthermore, water and gas flow rates were not determined at DDH932, so an average of the flow rates measured at DDH944 and DDH951 was used.\nThe ratio of gas flow rate\/water flow rate at each borehole was used to calculate the concentration of dissolved volatiles that would have been in solution when fluids and gases were subject to an estimated \u223c100 bars lithostatic pressure at depth in the reservoir (Table S1). This assumption generates a maximum estimate of aqueous gas abundances. If actual reservoir pressures were lower than our estimate, aqueous gas abundances may be lower, and \u0394G values would shift accordingly.\nUsing measured and assumed dissolved concentrations, the activities of reactants and products involved in studied microbial reactions were calculated. Due to high ionic strengths of the Soudan brines, a semi-empirical base Pitzer\/Harvie\u2013M\u00f8ller\u2013Weare (HMW) activity model was used to calculate the activity coefficients of dissolved aqueous species. Calculated activities were compared to standard state equilibrium values to derive thermodynamic affinity or disequilibria for a given reaction (see SI for additional details).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nTemperature, conductivity, pH, and flow rates\nThe brines flowing from boreholes DDH932, DDH951, and DDH944 are low temperature (11.5-12.1\u00b0C), high conductivity (121.3-174.4 mS) fluids (\nTable 1\n\n) that are 3-5 times more saline than seawater. These salinities are comparable to brines emitted in other deep mines in the Canadian Shield (Frape et al., 1984; Schuler et al., 2022). The pH of the brines increase from 6.1 to 6.9 with distance from east to west down the 27th level west drift. This near-neutral pH range coincides closely with the acid dissociation constants (pKa1) of the \u2211CO2(aq) and \u2211H2S(aq) (H2S(aq)\u202f+\u202fHS\u2212\n(aq)) systems. Thus, pH exerts an important influence on the dominant inorganic carbon and sulfide species at each borehole. Water flow rates range from 1.1-3.4 mL\/s with an uncertainty (2\u03c3) of 0.4 mL\/s, while gas flow rates range from 0.18-0.36 mL\/s with an uncertainty (2\u03c3) of 0.16 mL\/s (\nTable 1\n).\n\n\n4.2\nAlkanes and inorganic gases\nThe gas emitted from DDH932, DDH951, and DDH944 is dominated by CH4, making up 69.3% to 83.0% of the total gas volume. The volume percent of C2H6 ranged from 1.36% to 1.95%, along with <1% of C3H8, i-C4H10, and n-C4H10 (\nTable 2\n\n). These alkane abundances are similar to those emitted from other mines in the Canadian, Fennoscandian, and South African Shields (Sherwood Lollar et al., 1993b; Ward et al., 2004). There is no trend in CH4 abundance with location along the west drift. However, there are small, \u223c2-3% decreases in the relative abundance of CH4 balanced by slight increases of C2-C4 alkanes in November 2019, compared to samples collected in February 2019. Gas compositions determined in this study are similar to those measured in 2006 at borehole DDH942, located west of DDH944 on the same level of the Soudan mine, as reported in Sheik et al. (2021).\nThe second most abundant gas emitted is N2, which comprises 10.8% to 24.6% of the total gas volume. Taken together, CH4 and N2 account for >95% of the total volume once gas budgets are normalized to 100%. Measured CO2(g) ranges from 0.049% to 0.156%. Free molecular H2 was 0.306% in DDH944 but was below the analytical detection limit (<0.05%) in DDH932 and DDH951. H2 was also below detection in DDH942 (Sheik et al., 2021). Precambrian Shield gases are known to exhibit wide variability in H2 content, ranging from below detection to >10% by volume (Li et al., 2016). The abundance of Ar and He ranged from 0.319% to 0.509% and 0.351% to 0.984%, respectively. Any O2 entrained in samples is assumed to be atmospheric contamination due to anoxic conditions of the fluids (Schuler et al., 2022). Measured O2 ranged from 0.511% to 0.963% by volume. Gas volume percent utilized in thermodynamic models were recalculated to exclude O2 and corresponding atmospheric-derived N2 and Ar.\n\n\n4.3\nAqueous species\nDissolved \u2211CO2(aq) concentrations of 0.314 mmol\/kg and 0.307 mmol\/kg were determined in DDH932 and DDH951, respectively. Abundances for \u2211NH\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n(aq) for February 2019 samples ranged from 32.4 \u03bcmol\/kg to 39.5 \u03bcmol\/kg. However, borehole DDH932 increased by 42% to 49.6 \u03bcmol\/kg \u2211NH\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n(aq) in November 2019, while DDH951 experienced a 36% decrease to 20.7 \u03bcmol\/kg \u2211NH\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n(aq) over the same timeframe. These fluctuations exceed analytical uncertainty, indicating that \u2211NH\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n(aq) abundances shifted over 9 months. The concentration of DMA was 41.1 nmol\/kg in DDH951, while MMA and TMA were below detection, <100 nmol\/kg and <10 nmol\/kg, respectively. Aqueous \u2211H2S abundances were too low to be directly measured. Rather, HS\u2212 activity was estimated to be 10\u221211 by assuming mineral-fluid equilibrium with a hematite-pyrite-chamosite mineral buffer assemblage at 12\u00b0C, based on observations of these minerals in exposed bedrock and legacy cores matched to the boreholes (Fig. S1). This mineral assemblage would buffer fluid pH to a value slightly below 7, in good agreement with our pH measurements ranging from 6.0-6.9 (\nTable 1\n).\n\n\n4.4\nSolvent extractable organics\nA variety of organic compounds were identified in the solvent extracts including hydrocarbons, fatty acids (FA), and alcohols. The hydrocarbons were dominated by alkenes with only trace amounts of n-alkanes present. Fatty acids and trace amounts of alcohols were identified by their trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives within the derivatized samples. Trimethylsilyl FA n-C16:0 and n-C18:0 are the most abundant FA, and the saturated FA show a strong even-over-odd preference in all samples.\n\n\n4.5\nWater, carbon, and hydrogen isotopes\nWater isotope values are similar across the three boreholes, ranging from \u221211.4\u2030 to \u221210.5\u2030 for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \u221268.4\u2030 to \u221261.2\u2030 for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O. These values have been stable at these boreholes over the past several years (Schuler et al., 2022).\nConsistent \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values are observed across the three boreholes, ranging from \u221243.9\u2030 to \u221242.1\u2030, while longer chain alkane \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values range from \u221238.0\u2030 to \u221236.2\u2030 for C2H6, \u221236.8\u2030 to \u221234.9\u2030 for C3H8, and \u221235.3\u2030 to \u221233.7\u2030 for n-C4H10. Hydrocarbon stable carbon isotope values determined on February 2019 samples are indistinguishable from those collected in November 2019 except for C2H6 in DDH932, which shifts by \u22121.8\u2030 in November relative to February. Values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHCH4 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHC2H6 for DDH932 were similar during both sampling trips, ranging from \u2212419\u2030 to \u2212417\u2030 and \u2212322\u2030 and \u2212319\u2030, respectively. Values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHCH4 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHC2H6 for DDH944 and DDH951 in November 2019 were also similar at \u2212408\u2030 and \u2212316\u2030, and \u2212416\u2030 and \u2212320\u2030, respectively. Gases collected in February 2019 at DDH951 had \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHCH4 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHC2H6 values of \u2212390\u2030 and \u2212308\u2030. Measurements of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\u2211CO2(aq) are similar across the three boreholes, ranging from \u221221.4\u2030 to \u221220.4\u2030 in February 2019 and \u221219.8\u2030 to \u221218.6\u2030 in November 2019. Values for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCO2(g) range from \u221228.1\u2030 to \u221227.0\u2030.\nValues of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D for DDH932 and DDH951 are 4.2\u2030 and 4.1\u2030, respectively. Modeled equilibrium temperatures of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D are based on the equation:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n\n\nH\n\n\n3\n\n\nD\n(\nT\n)\n=\n\u2212\n0.11006\n\n\n(\n\n\n1000\n\n\nT\n\n\n)\n\n\n3\n\n\n+\n1.04151\n\n\n(\n\n\n1000\n\n\nT\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n0.55235\n\n(\n\n\n1000\n\n\nT\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n where T is temperature in Kelvin. This equation is derived from fundamental vibrational frequencies calculated using density functional theory (Whitehill et al., 2017). The modeled equilibrium temperatures of CH4 in boreholes DDH932 and DDH951 are 84\u00b0C and 89\u00b0C, respectively.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nIsolation of the west drift brine\nDeep crystalline bedrock fluids in Precambrian shield settings are often isolated from meteoric surficial waters, as indicated by \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O values that do not align with typical global and local meteoric water trends (Frape and Fritz, 1982) (\nFig. 2\n\n\n.). The causes of depletions in 18OH2O or enrichments in 2HH2O are not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain these trends, including isotopic exchange during the formation of secondary clays and equilibration with silicate minerals and\/or gases (e.g., CO2 and H2) (Frape and Fritz, 1982).\nSeveral brine reservoirs hosted in Precambrian bedrock have \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O values that trend toward the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) (\nFig. 2\n), indicative of mixing between fresh meteoric and highly saline endmembers. At Soudan, meteoric water incursion has been identified in borehole fluids in the east drift on the 27th level (Schuler et al., 2022). These east drift fluids are relatively less saline than those on the west drift, have \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O values that fall near the GMWL (orange circles; \nFig. 2\n), and reflect mixtures of meteoric water and saline brine. In contrast, the west drift brines presented here are characterized by higher salinities and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O values that are more offset from the local meteoric water line (orange squares; \nFig. 2\n). A previous study demonstrates that higher salinity fluids at Soudan correspond to larger offsets in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O from the GMWL (Schuler et al., 2022). Similar trends between salinity and water isotopes are also observed in other brines hosted in the Precambrian Canadian Shield (Warr et al., 2021). The deviation from the GMWL \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O trendline in Soudan Mine fluids is likely driven by 18O depletion rather than 2H enrichment due to the absence of abundant H2 in the boreholes. These results demonstrate that the DDH932, DDH951, and DDH944 brines contain more saline endmember and have experienced little mixing with surficial water sources. We infer that nutrients, carbon, and energy are in limited supply in our fluids relative to reservoirs with more connection to the surface hydrologic system.\n\n\n5.2\nSources of energy for the deep continental biosphere\nThe anaerobic oxidation of CH4 (AOM) and longer-chain alkanes has been observed in diverse natural settings, including hydrocarbon seep sediments, hydrothermal vents, and other mine-accessible Precambrian shield reservoirs (Bose et al., 2013; Teske et al., 2002; Magnabosco et al., 2018). High CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 at Soudan suggest that alkane oxidation by alternative electron acceptors may represent a significant potential energy source in this energy-limited landscape. To test this hypothesis, the thermodynamic affinity of 11 reactions were determined, including oxidation of alkanes by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n and NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n, the reduction of SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n, and Fe2O3 by H2, and methanogenesis via the reduction of CO2 by H2 and via the breakdown of DMA (\nTable 3\n\n). We have not included TMA or MMA in these calculations, as both chemical species were below analytical detection limits. However, microorganisms at Soudan carry genes for the utilization of both TMA and MMA, indicating that both can be used for methanogenesis (Sheik et al., 2021).\nA negative \u0394G value in kJ\/mole indicates that a reaction can proceed to the right as written, and therefore represents a potential microbial energy source (\nFig. 3\n\n\n.). However, this standard approach would not directly account for reactant limitations in the Soudan fluids. We therefore take the calculation a step further and use the concentration of the limiting reactant (\nTable 3\n) to also report \u0394G values for each reaction in units of J\/kgfluid (\nFig. 4\n\n\n., see details in SI, Table S2).\nThe oxidation of CH4 by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n at Soudan represents one of the least negative \u0394G values in kJ\/mole (\nFig. 3\n); however, it has the greatest potential energy source per mass fluid in the brines of all reactions modeled, with \u0394G ranging from \u2212111 to \u221295.5 J\/kgfluid (\nFig. 4\n\na). The oxidation of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 by NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n and oxidation of C2H6 and C3H8 by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n are also energetically favorable and collectively range from \u221219.9 to \u22121.07 J\/kgfluid. Using previously created shotgun metagenome assemblies (Sheik et al., 2021), organisms and genes indicative of CH4 and alkane degradation were explored. There are several potential routes for biological anaerobic CH4 oxidation (AOM). However, no anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) Archaea or Methylomirabilota (NC10 bacteria) were detected in the metagenomes. Several ANME archaea can oxidize CH4 with SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n or NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n, while NC10 bacteria grow in anaerobic environments but use O2 produced intracellularly from NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n reduction to oxidize methane (see Chadwick et al., 2022 and references within). Additionally, alkyl succinate synthase genes that anaerobic bacteria can use to degrade short to medium chain alkanes were not detected. Given that C2-C4 alkane concentrations are similar to those in other Precambrian Shield environments, it is likely that microorganisms may not prefer to metabolize them or that consumption does not outweigh production.\nThe potential energy per mass fluid for reactions involving reduction by H2 is modeled in DDH944 (\nFig. 4\n\nb), but not for DDH932 and DDH951, where H2 was below detection. The potential energies for reduction of SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n, and Fe2O3 by H2 are \u22121.00, \u22123.42, and \u22120.810 J\/kgfluid respectively. The observation of free molecular H2 only at DDH944 contrasts with the strong chemical similarity that is otherwise observed across the three boreholes. Two hypotheses that might account for the presence of H2 in DDH944 and absence in DDH932 and DDH951 are (1) microbes are consuming H2 at a rate exceeding its replenishment rate in DDH932, and DDH951 (Sheik et al., 2021) and\/or (2) H2 is independently sourced to DDH944 through a fracture network that is isolated from the other boreholes located further east along the drift. Given the similarity in other chemistry, hypothesis (1) is the most likely explanation.\nThe \u0394G values that we determined for Soudan, in kJ\/mole units, for alkane oxidation by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n (reactions 1-3, Table 3) and SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n reduction by H2 (reaction 7, Table 3) are similar to analogous \u0394G values calculated at the Kloof mine in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa (Kieft et al., 2005). In contrast, reactions involving CH4 oxidation by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n and NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n (reactions 1 and 4, Table 3) and SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n and NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n reduction by H2 (reactions 7 and 8, Table 3) have greater energy potential at Soudan compared to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, USA (Osburn et al., 2014). Kloof and SURF are also hosted in Precambrian aged bedrock and emit alkanes and fluids from legacy boreholes, similar to the Soudan mine.\nValues of \u0394G as low as \u221210 kJ\/mol have been suggested to support microbial metabolism (Hoehler, 2004). All calculated \u0394G values in this study are more negative than this threshold, indicating that minimum energy requirements are met in the Soudan fluids (\nFig. 3\n). More negative \u0394G values imply that organisms can mediate these reactions more favorably. However, thermodynamics alone does not dictate substrate utilization but rather the energy demand to process these reactions. The high potential energy for specific reactions could also be evidence of a lack of active metabolic pathways that utilize them. The integration of chemical (e.g., thermodynamic) and biological (e.g., metagenomic and culture) assessments is key to identifying which in situ microbial processes are actively occurring in fluids.\nMethanogenesis may be a pillar in the carbon cycle along with other non-biological processes that produce alkanes in the Soudan Mine. The calculated \u0394G value for methanogenesis by CO2 reduction with H2 via reaction 9 in Table 3 is exergonic (\n\u0394\nG\n=\n\u2212\n87.8\n kJ\/mol) (\nFig. 3\n). Genomics assessments, however, have not identified hydrogenotrophic methanogens that would mediate this reaction (Sheik et al., 2021). Instead, methanogens that utilize methylated substrates were detected in the Soudan fluids by Sheik and colleagues. Methyl-based methanogenesis produces CH4 via the breakdown of a methyl group (\u2212CH3) in an organic compound, and thus differs fundamentally from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis which involves the reduction of inorganic carbon (e.g., CO2) by H2. It has also been suggested that methyl-based methanogens may actively cycle H2, as observed in marine sediment experiments (Finke et al., 2007). While methylamines (MMA, DMA, and TMA) have been quantified in several marine environments (Zhuang et al., 2017; Cree et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019) and have been utilized as substrates for methanogenesis in isolated cultures from deep-sea coal beds, terrestrial shales, and shallow marine sediments (Finke et al., 2007; Vigneron et al., 2015; Daly et al., 2016; Trembath-Reichert et al., 2017), this study is the first to identify DMA in natural fluids hosted in Precambrian bedrock. It is proposed that glycine betaine, a common osmolyte for halobacteria (Sleator and Hill, 2001), may be converted to TMA and subsequently demethylated to DMA and MMA to produce CH4 in Soudan's fluids (Sheik et al., 2021). The presence of DMA in DDH951 provides support for this suggested pathway. TMA may be demethylated rapidly through this process to concentrations below detection (<10 nmol\/kg), producing quantifiable DMA similar to that found in methanogenic cultures when using TMA as a substrate (Watkins et al., 2014). The reaction for methanogenesis via the breakdown of DMA (reaction 11, Table 3) is exergonic (\n\u0394\nG\n=\n\u2212\n142 kJ\/mol) (\nFig. 3\n) but with very low available energy per mass fluid (\u22120.00635 J\/kgfluid). These findings insinuate that methyl-based methanogenesis is favorable and the low energy available per mass of fluid may be a manifestation of rapid consumption of DMA as a reactant while concordantly producing biological CH4.\n\n\n5.3\nThe origin of alkanes\nIdentifying the origin of CH4 and C2+ n-alkanes in the Soudan mine gas is a complex problem due to microorganisms that can actively manipulate the C cycle. In turn, the kinetics for spontaneous \u2211CO2(aq) reduction via abiotic reactions are sluggish or inhibited in low-temperature environments (<200\u00b0C) (McCollom, 2016). Alkane abiogenesis is proposed within deep crustal gas-rich reservoirs in several mines in Precambrian Shield settings (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Kiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen et al., 2017), and parallels are drawn to their abiotic synthesis in hydrothermal vents (McDermott et al., 2015). Stable isotope measurements, such as \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4, are a classic approach to determining the origin and cycling of carbon species in natural systems. One difference between the continental and marine environment is that presumed abiotic \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values are more 13C-depleted in continental settings (approximately \u221240\u2030 to \u221230\u2030) compared to seafloor hydrothermal fluids (approximately \u221220\u2030 to \u221210\u2030) (McCollom and Seewald, 2007). Values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 at Soudan of \u221243.9\u2030 to \u221242.1\u2030 are \u223c5-10\u2030 more depleted than proposed abiotic signatures at Kidd Creek (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002) (\nFig. 5\n\n). In general, values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 produced via active methanogenesis are significantly depleted relative to CH4 produced via thermogenic and abiotic processes (Sherwood Lollar et al., 1993b; Ward et al., 2004) (\nFig. 5\n). Microbial \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values are typically <-50\u2030 (Rice and Claypool, 1981) and are directly influenced by the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC of the source of carbon. Thermogenic alkanes exhibit a wide range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values, which can also be attributed to differences in source materials and thermal maturity (Rooney et al., 1995).\nTrends in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values can also be assessed for longer chain alkanes. C1-C4 alkanes produced through thermogenic processes often show a positive enrichment of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC with increasing carbon number due to the preferential primary cleaving of 12C and 1H bonds forming CH4 during organic pyrolysis (Clayton, 1991). This enrichment trend is observed in Soudan's gases (Fig. S2). In contrast, isotopic \u2018reversals\u2019 between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 and more depleted \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCC2+ are postulated to be produced abiotically (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002). However, several laboratory-based abiotic synthesis studies produced alkanes with isotope enrichment trends that mimic those classically associated with thermogenesis (McCollom, 2013 and refs. therein).\nFurther, abiotic C1-C3 alkanes in some natural seafloor hydrothermal fluids also show positive enrichment of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values with increasing carbon number (McDermott et al., 2015). Finally, enriched \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 compared to depleted \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCC2+ has also been observed in thermogenic settings due to the possible mixing of mature and immature gas in open systems with multiple sources of organic material (Fiebig et al., 2019). Isotope trends alone are therefore insufficient to identify non-biological organic synthesis pathways unequivocally. Further study of natural abiotic synthesis of alkanes is needed, particularly in continental environments.\nIn systems where methanogenesis is a dominant contributor to the CH4 pool, high C1\/C2+ ratios are observed due to the high abundance of microbial CH4 relative to C2+ alkanes (Rooney et al., 1995). Although the biological production of longer-chained alkanes has been identified in marine sediments (Hinrichs et al., 2006), the significance of biological C2+ production in deep continental environments remains unknown. Soudan's C1\/C2+ values are lower than those in settings that are thought to reflect purely microbial-produced gas. However, the C1\/C2+ and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values are trending away from typical non-microbial ranges, towards the microbial field in Fig. 5. These values reflect a mixture of predominantly non-microbial CH4 with lesser degrees of biological CH4 at Soudan. This conclusion closely aligns with gases collected in the Evander mine in the South African Shield (Ward et al., 2004) (\nFig. 5\n).\nIt is plausible that methyl-based methanogenesis may be the biological source of CH4, mixing with a non-microbial source and depleting bulk \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 at Soudan. Other processes such as the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) could concurrently influence isotopic and abundance values, enriching the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values of the residual CH4 pool. However, if AOM were a dominant control on CH4 abundance, one would expect Soudan's \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values (\u221243.9\u2030 to \u221242.1\u2030) to be more enriched than typical non-microbial values (\u221240\u2030 to \u221230\u2030) due to the residual enrichment of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 through methanotrophy.\nAlong with traditional \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC isotope signatures, rare doubly substituted \u2018clumped\u2019 isotopes of CH4 (i.e., 13CH3D) provide valuable information that may be used to determine CH4 formation temperatures or identify microbial influences (Ono et al., 2014; Stolper et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). During the formation of CH4, \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D (equation (2)) can equilibrate at the formation temperature (\nFig. 6\n\n). Provided that \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D does not undergo further isotopic exchange after post-formation changes in environmental temperature (horizontal arrow, \nFig. 7\n\n), the \u2018clumped\u2019 isotope may be used as a geothermometer (Stolper et al., 2014). However, microbial manipulation of CH4 can shift \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values to a state of disequilibrium, as demonstrated by cultures and natural samples (Wang et al., 2015; Ono et al., 2021). Natural biological \u2018clumped\u2019 CH4 values have been observed to equilibrate at low environmental temperatures in some cases, as seen in the biodegradation of oil by methanogens in the Gulf of Mexico (Stolper et al., 2014) (\nFig. 7\n). In other cases, several methanogenic cultures (H2 and methyl-based) and natural samples show \u2018de-clumped\u2019 \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D signals, with apparent extreme high temperatures of 200 to >500\u00b0C (upward arrow, \nFig. 7\n) (Wang et al., 2015; Gruen et al., 2018). Abiotic processes have also been postulated to slightly lower \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values in continental settings (Young et al., 2017), although not to the extent of methanogenesis. Methanotrophic cultures have also been observed to reverse this \u2018de-clumping\u2019 effect, resulting in enriched \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values on the residual CH4 pool and shifting modeled temperatures lower (downward arrow, \nFig. 7\n), possibly lower than environmental temperatures (Ono et al., 2021). Soudan \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values of 4.1-4.2\u2030 point to formation temperatures of 84\u00b0C and 89\u00b0C (\nFig. 6\n). These formation temperatures are warmer than present-day environmental temperatures of 11.5-12.1\u00b0C (\nFig. 7\n), but below the typical threshold of \u223c100\u00b0C needed to form natural gas (Rooney et al., 1995). These temperatures also approach the known upper limit for microbial life (122\u00b0C, Takai et al., 2008). The difference between CH4 formation temperature and environmental temperature may be due to the migration of microbial \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D equilibrated at warmer temperatures at depth. However, a formation temperature of 84-89\u00b0C puts the estimated depth of the water source at >6 km, assuming a thermal gradient of 12-14\u00b0C\/km (Artemieva and Mooney, 2001), much deeper than the 0.7 km depth of the 27th level of the mine plus the extended 144 m of borehole depth (\nFig. 1\n). Two other hypotheses that would better explain this temperature discrepancy are (1) there is mixing of microbial equilibrated \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D at environmental temperatures (11.5-12.1\u00b0C) and non-microbial \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D equilibrated at higher formation temperatures; or (2) non-microbial \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D equilibrated at higher formation temperatures, environmental temperatures cooled to allow for life to persist, then methanotrophic organisms consumed CH4, enriching the residual 13CH3D and drawing \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values closer to equilibrium. Values in Fig. 5 show that mixing of microbial and non-microbial CH4 is likely, which is consistent with hypothesis (1). Hypothesis (2) is also compelling due to the modeled exergonic reactions involving AOM (\nFigs. 3 and 4\n\na). However, Soudan's slightly depleted \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values compared to non-microbial sources suggest that this is not the case.\nDistinguishing microbial and thermogenic \u2018clumped\u2019 CH4 signatures from those that are abiotic remains a difficult task. Soudan's \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values are similar to those of presumed abiotic CH4 in Kidd Creek Mine, Ontario (\nFig. 7\n). The sites are chemically distinct (e.g., Kidd Creek contains >10% H2, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCCH4 values of \u223c-35\u2030 (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002; Li et al., 2016)) but they nonetheless occupy a similar space in Fig. 7, with a similar modeled temperature for \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D. It is also interesting to note that, although Soudan and Kidd Creek's C1-C4 alkane \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values do not overlap and display distinct trends with increasing carbon number (Fig. S2), the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHCH4 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHC2H6 values determined in this study (\u2212419\u2030 to \u2212390\u2030 and \u2212322\u2030 to \u2212308\u2030) are indistinguishable from those measured at Kidd Creek (\u2212419\u2030 to \u2212390\u2030 and \u2212321\u2030 to \u2212299\u2030) (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2002). For abiogenesis to occur, sufficient quantities of H2 are needed. Unlike Kidd Creek, Soudan lacks significant free H2, suggesting that abiotic production of C1-C4 alkanes is unlikely. Soudan's C1-C4 alkanes are therefore likely sourced from a thermogenic origin mixed with a supply of CH4 from microbial processes.\nThe trace C10+ n-alkanes in Soudan's fluids that are present in the solvent extractable organic fraction are not sourced through thermogenic precursors, but rather from non-thermally altered biological communities as indicated by their odd-over-even preference and non-unimodal distribution (Tissot and Welte, 1984). This conclusion is further supported by the observed prevalence of alkenes over n-alkanes and fatty acid (FA) distributions in the solvent extractable organic fraction (Fig. S3). The prominent n-C16:0 and n-C18:0 FA, which account for the major FA in all three boreholes, are often the most abundant in many bacteria and eukaryotes (Thurman, 1985). The C1-C4 alkane thermogenic pool at Soudan may thus be derived from an alternative source, such as older high temperature gas generated by pyrolysis of organics, or the migration of gases from an external thermogenic source. Although the current temperature at the 27th level is 11.5-12.1\u00b0C, the thermal history of its bedrock suggests that alteration of organic material would have been possible. Hydrothermal modification of Soudan's BIF at 150\u00b0C to >300\u00b0C is proposed to have occurred post-deposition (>2.5 Ga) with several deformation events occurring afterwards (Thompson, 2015). This temperature range would support pyrolysis of organics that may have been trapped in the bedrock, possibly producing CH4 and volatile alkanes. Subsequent tectonic events may have also formed conduits for external thermogenic CH4 to migrate to the Soudan fracture network.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nLegacy boreholes on Soudan's 27th level west drift expel chemically and isotopically similar brines, indicating that they likely tap one source fluid. Values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOH2O and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n2\n\n\nHH2O that deviate from global and local meteoric water lines indicate that this saline endmember is largely isolated from surficial waters. Therefore, chemotrophic interactions currently drive energy production for subsurface microbial communities. The high abundance of C1-C4 alkanes and negative \u0394G values for alkane oxidation by SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n and NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n demonstrate that these compounds are viable energy sources. Reactions involving the reduction of oxidized species by H2 are exergonic in DDH944. The lack of detectable H2 in DDH951 and DDH932 may be due to its rapid consumption in these boreholes due to the presence of non-methanogenic hydrogen oxidizing microbes (Sheik et al., 2021). Although methanogenesis involving CO2 reduction by H2 is exergonic, an absence of hydrogenotrophic organisms suggests that this pathway is not active and is likely competitively excluded by the low H2 concentrations. Instead, Sheik and colleagues identify methyl-based methanogens that could utilize methylamines. The observation that DMA methanogenesis is exergonic with very low available energy per mass fluid supports these assertions. Methylamines may thus be a key substrate for the biological production of CH4 in Soudan. Hydrocarbon abundance ratios and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC isotope signatures show that mixing of CH4 of both microbial and non-microbial origin is likely occurring. Results from doubly substituted \u2018clumped\u2019 CH4 (i.e., 13CH3D) also support mixed sources of CH4 due to the warm modeled temperatures (84-89\u00b0C) that are well above Soudan's environmental temperatures but below thermogenic production thresholds. Similar \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n13\n\n\nCH3D values for \u2018mixed\u2019 CH4 from Soudan compared to presumed abiotic CH4 from Kidd Creek demonstrates the need for more examinations into \u2018clumped\u2019 CH4 signals across a diverse set of low temperature, natural continental settings. The abundance of C2+ alkanes, coupled to minimal H2 concentrations in Soudan, point to a likely thermogenic origin, though an abiotic source of hydrocarbons cannot be entirely ruled out. This study quantifies the availability of energy sources to chemotrophic microbes in Soudan Mine in the present day. These findings illuminate a \u2018hidden\u2019 modern deep continental biosphere and set the stage to model past and future habitability controls. These investigations can also aid planetary studies that seek to determine biogeochemical conditions relevant to habitability on other bodies in our solar system by using Earth-based systems as extraterrestrial analogues.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nWilliam S.

Therefore, understanding the evolution of the continental crust requires quantification of their relative contributions at all spatial and temporal scales (Korenaga, 2018). Convergent margin (\u201carc\u201d) magmatism has been modulating these fluxes since the onset of plate tectonics, i.e. at least for three billion years (Hawkesworth et al., 2020; Rudnick and Gao, 2003). Specifically, three main reservoirs contribute to the production of arc magmas (Hawkesworth et al., 2020; Tatsumi and Kogiso, 2003): (1) the mantle wedge, whose melting results in crustal growth; (2) the slab, including a hydrated oceanic crust and some amount of continent-derived sediments, the latter of which, depending on whether they are incorporated in arc magmas or not, contribute to either recycling or crustal reworking in the form of \u201csource\u201d contamination; and (3) the overriding crust, whose melting contributes to crustal reworking in the form of \u201cpath\u201d contamination.\nThe chemical and isotopic compositions of arc magmas may thus reflect both source contamination of the mantle wedge by slab-derived material; and path contamination of mantle-derived magmas by melting of the overriding crust. These two mechanisms have fundamentally different predictions in terms of the mass and energy balance for the long-term evolution of continents. For a given volume of magma, source contamination is expected to need less crustal material than path contamination to reach a given chemical and isotopic signature (Hawkesworth et al., 1993); and an increase in source contamination also entails a concomitant decrease in crustal recycling (into the mantle) as slab material is re-incorporated to the crust. Distinguishing between the two processes, therefore, is essential for quantifying the balance between crustal growth, recycling and reworking in arcs and in turn, the interpretation of isotopic proxies used to upscale regional observations to the global scale, such as oxygen (O) and hafnium (Hf) isotopic compositions of detrital zircon (Hawkesworth and Kemp, 2006; Korenaga, 2018; Roberts and Spencer, 2015).\nQuantifying the relative importance of source and path contamination in a given arc requires detailed knowledge of end-member compositions for each reservoir, their spatial variations, and the way they may interact in the lower crust and mantle wedge (Jacob et al., 2021; Jagoutz and Klein, 2018). However, such knowledge is generally lacking, as exposure bias skews the study of arc magmatism towards its end products (i.e., upper crustal intermediate to silicic plutons and volcanic rocks). Even in rare areas where arc crustal sections are thoroughly studied, these are represented by former oceanic arcs (e.g., Talkeetna and Kohistan arc, Greene et al., 2006; Jagoutz and Klein, 2018), which, by definition, lack large pre-existing crustal volumes susceptible to interact with the mantle magmas, so that the relative impact of source and path contamination remains poorly understood.\nIn this paper, we address the problem by focusing on an exceptional natural laboratory, the Famatinian continental arc section. This arc has exposures of large volumes of lower crustal mafic, mid-crustal intermediate, upper crustal silicic plutonic rocks and their host crustal rocks, and the paleogeography of the different magmatic units is well reconstructed (Otamendi et al., 2020; Rapela et al., 2018). Altogether, the Famatinian arc offers the unique opportunity to evaluate the role of source vs. path contamination in a continental arc. We combine bulk-rock petrological data, with an extensive database of high-precision U\/Pb ages and in-situ Hf-O isotopic ratios on zircon from all available rock types in the Famatinian system to decipher the contributions of source and path contamination during this Ordovician magmatic episode.\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nMajor, trace and Ca isotopes bulk rock measurements\nWe present here bulk-rock data from 73 samples collected from this study that is added to a pre-existing compilation of 310 samples for the Famatinian arc (Camilletti et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2015). Bulk rock major and trace element analyses were collected using XRF methods and are provided in Supplementary Material 1. We also present radiogenic Ca isotope measurements performed on 4 endmember samples that span the entire compositional range observed in our collection (Antonelli and Simon, 2020; Supplementary material 6).\n\n\n2.2\nO-Hf isotopes, U-Pb dating and trace elements in zircon\nWe have investigated a total of 62 samples for zircon geochemistry. Zircon were separated from other phases using a high voltage selective fragmentation apparatus (SelFrag) followed by heavy liquids, magnetic separation and hand picking. Zircon were annealed at 900\u00b0C for 48 h in a muffle furnace before being placed on epoxy mounts together with two reference materials (91500 and MudTank, \u00c1vila et al., 2020; Wiedenbeck et al., 2004) that underwent the same annealing protocol. Zircon grains were imaged using a Deben Centaurus panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) detector mounted on a Jeol JSM-6390LA Secondary Electron Microscope (SEM) in ETH Zurich (images available in Supplementary Material 2). The images were used to identify potential inherited cores, metamict zones and inclusions. In chronological order, we used Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) for O isotopes, Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) for preliminary U-Pb dating and trace element concentrations, and LA-Multi Collector-ICPMS (LA-MC-ICPMS) for Hf isotopes. A selection of 21 representative samples based on the lack of inherited cores, geographical relevance and data quality from other analytical measurements (e.g., close to average 1 s.d. or, in the case of LA-ICPMS dates, 1 propagated errors) were analyzed for high precision U-Pb geochronology using chemical abrasion - isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry techniques (CA-ID-TIMS) at ETH Zurich (Wotzlaw et al., 2017). Details about the analytical methods are provided in the supplementary materials. Supplementary Tables 1 to 6 contain the data presented hereafter and the CL images.\n\n\n\n3\nThe anatomy and construction of the Famatinian arc\n\n3.1\nGeological background\nThe activity of the Famatinian arc in Argentina started during the late Cambrian, at ca. 490 Ma, due to the protracted convergence between Gondwana and Laurentia that began during the Pre-Cambrian (Otamendi et al., 2020; Rapela et al., 2018). The Famatinian magmatism was responsible for thickening the crust to 25-30 km with coeval formation of volcano-sedimentary deposits from sub-aerial volcanoes locally named the Suri formation (Armas et al., 2020). The arc magmas intruded into a thin continental crust (ca. 15 km) mainly composed of Cambrian, siliciclastic meta-sedimentary rocks locally named, from bottom to top, the Negro Peinado formation and the Achavil formation (Fig. 1, Collo et al., 2009). These pre-existing crustal components of the upper plate are characterized by a monotonous lithological association at the crustal-scale along the arc axis at the time of formation of the Famatinian arc, dominated by turbiditic sequences (Otamendi et al., 2020; Rapela et al., 2018). The Famatinian arc ended with the collision of the Cuyania terrane around 460 Ma ago. This terrane, lying west of the suture zone, is composed of a Proterozoic basement overlain by early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Ramacciotti et al., 2015; Thomas and Astini, 2003; Ramos, 2004). These sediments were accreted along the margin of Gondwana in the Ordovician (Ramos, 2004) and partly subducted under the Famatinian arc, as indicated by high-pressure and high-temperature metamorphism (12 kbar, 780\u00b0C, e.g., Mulcahy et al., 2014) and structural evidence of slab entrainment (Ramos, 2004; van Staal et al., 2011).\nThe most voluminous magmas of the Ordovician Famatinian arc are grouped in three locality types along a \u223c600 km N-S transect with each of them representing different crustal levels: (1) the lower crust in Valle F\u00e9rtil (between 30 and 31.5\u00b0S) subdivided as a mafic (Walker et al., 2015) and intermediate zone (Camilletti et al., 2020), (2) the intermediate crust in the Sierra de Famatina (between 28.5 and 30\u00b0S; Dahlquist et al., 2008), and (3) the upper crust with the Ordovician sub-surface in the Chaschuil belt (between 27 and 28\u00b0S; Armas et al., 2020) (\nFig. 1\n\n). The Valle F\u00e9rtil area shows a large range of mafic to intermediate plutonic rocks that intruded and metamorphosed the local crust at pressure estimated from 8 to 5 kbar by typical mineral assemblages (e.g., garnet-cordierite-sillimanite bearing migmatites, Tibaldi et al., 2013). The Sierra de Famatina batholith grew at pressures equivalent of ca. 5 kbar, which was derived from geological evidence of contacts with both the Negro Peinado and the Achavil formation (Dahlquist et al., 2008), the occurrence of magmatic epidote in plutonic samples and mineral assemblages in the metamorphosed host rock (cordierite-garnet bearing migmatites; Alasino et al., 2014). The Chaschuil belt settled at a pressure lower than 2 kbar, as inferred from the intrusive contact with the overlying sub-surficial volcano-clastic series locally named the Suri formation (Armas et al., 2020). The Chaschuil belt as well as the Sierra de Famatina are marked by the presence of granodioritic peripheral units outcropping on the edges of the main magmatic centers (\nFig. 1\n).\n\n\n3.2\nGeochemical connections\n\n3.2.1\nBulk rocks\nIn the Mg# [\n\n\nmolarMg\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n\/\n(\n\n\nMg\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nFe\n\n\n2\n+\n\n\n) with Fe2+ as total Fe] vs. SiO2 diagram, the most mafic rocks (<55 wt.% SiO2) display a Z-shaped pattern mimicking the composition of cumulates from the fractional crystallization of hydrous and oxidized, primitive arc magmas (Fig. 2a; Jagoutz and Klein, 2018; M\u00fcntener and Ulmer, 2018). The more silicic rocks define a metaluminous series (Aluminium Saturation Index \n[\n\nASI\n\n]\n<\n1\n), at the exception of the peripheral units (see below), consistent with olivine-orthopyroxene\/clinopyroxene-Fe-Ti oxides-amphibole fractionation in the deep crust and an amphibole-plagioclase dominated differentiation in the mid crust (Camilletti et al., 2020; Otamendi et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2015). The existence of Ordovician peraluminous rocks (\n\nASI\n\n>\n1\n; \nFig. 2\n\n\nb) in the Famatinian arc, likely formed by local anatexis of pre-existing sedimentary rocks (Otamendi et al., 2008; Tibaldi et al., 2013), raises the question of the contribution of crustal melts to the magmatic suite. However, these anatectic granites represent small outcrops in the Valle F\u00e9rtil lower crustal section that are geographically limited to near hybridization zones between mafic intrusions and pre-existing overriding crust (Otamendi et al., 2008). The compositions of these granites define a trend of increasing ASI with decreasing SiO2, typical of \u201cS-type\u201d granites (Jacob et al., 2021), opposite to the main trend of metaluminous samples (\nFig. 2\n\nb). Nevertheless, the volumetrically minor rocks of the peripheral units in Chaschuil and Sierra de Famatina seem to fill the gap between the two metaluminous vs. peraluminous trends at ca. 70 wt.% SiO2 (\nFig. 2\n\nb).\n\n\n3.2.2\nZircon trace elements\nBecause plutonic rocks rarely represent liquids, for mafic compositions but also for silicic ones (Cornet et al., 2022 and reference therein), the trace element composition of evolving melts in a differentiating magma is better observed through the trace element composition of minerals (e.g., zircon). We show here that trace element compositions of zircons capture the differentiation of parental mafic magmas across the different crustal levels of the Famatinian arc (\nFig. 3\n\n). The Eu\/Eu* vs. Ti plot (\nFig. 3\n\na) shows a trend of continuously decreasing Ti concentrations with increasingly negative Eu anomalies from gabbro to granite\/rhyolite, reflecting crystallization from progressively cooler, more plagioclase-fractionated melts. The zircon Eu anomaly may partly result from low oxygen fugacity during zircon crystallization (Trail et al., 2012) but if this was the only control, the very low Eu*\/EuN (<0.1) observed in zircon from intermediate\/felsic rocks would correspond to unrealistically low \nf\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n (\n\u0394\n\nNNO\n\n<\n\u2212\n4\n; Trail et al., 2012) compared to what is expected for arc magmas (Kelley and Cottrell, 2009). For other elements, such as U, Th, Y, Lu, Dy, and Hf (\nFig. 3\n\nb-d), the trends mark the increasing control of accessory phases (including zircon) on the incompatible element budget and the increase of the zircon\/melt partition coefficients with decreasing temperature as the melts evolve towards more silicic compositions (Claiborne et al., 2017). The Dy vs. Yb\/Dy trend reveals that, upon cooling, zircon was a key phase controlling the budget of these elements as zircon preferentially capture heavy rare earth (HREE) over Mid-REE (MREE), which blurs the potential effect of MREE capturing phases such as titanite or amphibole and clinopyroxene on the differentiation.\n\n\n\n3.3\nGeochronological connections\nBased on geochronological data, previous studies (Rapela et al., 2018 and references therein) recognized three main magmatic stages in the Famatinian arc: (1) build-up between 491 and 474 Ma; (2) peak magmatism between 474 and 466 Ma; and (3) decline between 466 and 455 Ma. In particular, the peak magmatic stage is well documented from a high-precision (ID-TIMS) U-Pb dataset on a series of samples from the Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic zone (Ducea et al., 2017). However, there is currently no published high-precision geochronological dataset from samples representing all domains and crustal levels, which prevents a detailed understanding of magmatism at the scale of the entire arc.\nWe filled this gap by obtaining additional LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dates and isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) uranium-lead data on 120 single zircon crystals from 21 samples (Supplementary Table 2-3). Hereafter, we only discuss magmatic zircon dates. Inherited zircons were absent from the Chaschuil and Sierra de Famatina samples, and only sparsely found in samples from the Valle Fertil area (48 grains out of 194 analyzed by LA-ICP-MS, and 7 out of 18 samples) collected near hybridization zones with the local host rocks (Otamendi et al., 2008). These cores show dominant U-Pb age populations at 1.1\u20130.9 and 0.6\u20130.5 Ga, which are typical of detrital zircon from the Negro Peinado formation (Collo et al., 2009).\nZircon dates were used to define estimated probability densities of crystallization ages for each crustal level (\nFig. 4\n\n). Most zircon of the Chaschuil belt and the Sierra de Famatina show ages between 473 and 467 Ma, overlapping the peak magmatic stage defined at \n470\n\u00b1\n3\n Ma for Valle F\u00e9rtil (from this study and Ducea et al., 2017). This shows that the largest magma volumes from ultramafic to highly silicic compositions, along the arc axis and across the exposed transcrustal magmatic column, must have formed in a relatively short magmatic accretion event of 6 million years or less. Importantly, the additional peak at ca. 482 Ma at Chaschuil and samples dated at 478 Ma in the Sierra de Famatina all belong to the peripheral units. We also expect enhanced preservation of zircon from the build-up period in the colder upper and mid-crustal environments relative to the lower crust.\n\n\n\n4\nZircon O-Hf systematics\nOxygen (O) and hafnium (Hf) isotopic data for Famatinian arc zircon that crystallized during the peak magmatic event show a counter-intuitive trend. Deep crustal mafic- and cumulate rocks have markedly crustal zircon isotopic compositions with \u03b5Hf in the range 0 to \u22125 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOZircon between 6.5 and 11.5\u2030 (corresponding to \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMelt between 8 to 13\u2030 based on the correction of Bindeman and Valley, 2003). In contrast, mid-\/upper crustal intermediate to silicic rocks (both volcanic and plutonic, in the center and north part of the arc) show mantle-like zircon isotopic compositions with \u03b5Hf in the range 0 to +7 and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOZircon between 4 and 6.5\u2030 (corresponding to \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMelt between 5.5 to 8\u2030) (\nFig. 5\n\n\na, Supplementary Table 4). This observation reflects a first-order petrogenetic control on magma production, as it applies to the entire arc and concerns most of the magma volumes produced over its lifetime. The trend could be interpreted in two ways (not mutually exclusive): (i) different amounts of crustal assimilation along the arc (e.g. path contamination\/AFC); or (ii) different signatures and\/or amounts of crustal components in the mantle source (e.g., source contamination). The respective importance of both processes is discussed in hereafter, notably based on geochemical modeling.\n\n4.1\n\u201cPath\u201d contamination and AFC modeling\nTo perform AFC calculations, we investigated different end-members representing the local host rocks. First, we obtained in-situ O-Hf isotopic analyses directly from Ordovician zircon rims in samples of metasedimentary migmatites embedded in the Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic zone, representative of partial melts from the local host rocks that interacted with the mafic magmas. Additionally, we have also used bulk-rock Nd isotopic compositions from samples of the Negro Peinado and the Ach\u00e1vil formation obtained in the vicinity of the Valle F\u00e9rtil and Sierra de Famatina localities to estimate Hf isotopic ratios. The measure \u03b5Nd range from \u22127 and \u221210 (Collo et al., 2009), which translates to \u03b5Hf = \u22129.6 to \u221214.3 (average of \u221212 used here) using the equation based on the terrestrial array of Vervoort et al. (2011). For oxygen isotopes, we have used \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO between 10 and 15\u2030 which are typical values for paragneiss and pelitic schist (Eiler, 2001) and encompass the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values we directly obtained on Ordovician zircon rims from the Valle F\u00e9rtil migmatites (+11 to \n+\n13\n\u2030\n). Other possible end-members such as the Puncoviscana formation (Otamendi et al., 2017; Rapela et al., 2018) and other low grade phyllites and schists have isotopic compositions falling in the compositional range used in our calculations. Various DHf values (from 0.1 to 0.3 as proposed by Kemp et al., 2007) and Mcrust\/Mmagma values (r-values = 0.2\u20130.7) are used. We selected the Valle F\u00e9rtil primitive basalt used by Walker et al. (2015) to estimate the initial Hf concentration of the melt (CHf = 1.66 ppm). The results of our AFC calculations are shown in \nFig. 5\n\nb.\nDeep seated mafic rocks have melt isotopic ratios (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n=\n8\n\u2013\n10\n\u2030\n, \n\u03b5\n\n\nHf\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n5.0\n\u00b1\n0.5\n) that are very close to metasedimentary migmatites within the local crust (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n=\n+\n11\n\u2013\n13\n\u2030\n, \n\u03b5\n\n\nHf\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n5.5\n\u00b1\n0.5\n). Hence, amounts of assimilation are predicted to be unreasonably high to reach the observed values. In addition, based on AFC modeling (DePaolo, 1981), neither of the selected end-members representing the system (\n\nFig. 5\n\nb) nor other possible pre-existing crustal end-members (see Methods; Supplementary Table 5) show a reasonable fit for the Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic rocks. Regardless, the closest fitting model would require 25 to 50% fractional crystallization of a Valle F\u00e9rtil basalt and a high mass ratio of assimilated to crystallized material (\u201cR\u201d) of at least \u223c0.7 (\nFig. 5\n\nb, Supplementary Table 5). Again, the latter is unrealistic in terms of major element compositions of the end products (Walker et al., 2015). An andesitic melt produced by 35% fractionation of a primitive arc basalt (ca. 55 wt.% SiO2; Ulmer et al., 2018) assimilating a crust-derived granitic melt with >70 wt.% SiO2 (Otamendi et al., 2009) would result in bulk \n\n\nSiO\n\n\n2\n\n\n>\n60\n wt.% and K2O of >4 wt.%, rarely observed in the Valle F\u00e9rtil lower crustal section (\nFig. 2\n). Moreover, the AFC models fail to fit the Sierra de Famatina and Chaschuil isotopic composition, and, as the isotopic trend is inversed to what would be expected from conventional AFC, the closest fitting model would create compositions too mafic compared to those observed (e.g., between 65 to 75% of SiO2, \nFig. 2\n).\n\n\n4.2\n\u201cSource\u201d contamination\nThe sediments of the Cuyania terrane (Ramacciotti et al., 2015), lying west of the suture front with Gondwana (\nFig. 1\n), offer the most representative approximation of the \u03b5Hf(t) of the actual sediment package that subducted underneath the Valle F\u00e9rtil magmatic column, estimated here from bulk-rock \u03b5Nd data (van Staal et al., 2011) and the equation of Vervoort et al. (2011). Although no O isotopic data exists on these rocks, two distinct \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values (+18 and +30 \u2030) covering the global range of subducted limestone and schists were used as end-member isotopic compositions (Eiler, 2001; Supplementary Table 5). Altogether, these O-Hf isotopic compositions are the most representative end-members of a crustal component that could have interacted with the paleo-mantle wedge at the regional scale. For the mantle end-member, we selected a depleted mantle peridotite with a \n\n\nC\n\n\nHf\n\n\n=\n0.199\n ppm, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n=\n5.5\n\u2030\n and \n\u03b5\n\nHf\n\n=\n16\n.\nFor the mafic rocks of Valle F\u00e9rtil, the results of our mixing calculations (\nFig. 5\n\nc) show that the lowest \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO crustal end-member implies high proportions of sediments in the mixture (up to 40 wt%). However, with the high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO end-member, only 15 to 25 wt% of subducted sediment are needed to reproduce the isotopic compositions of Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic rocks. Given that the Cuyania sequence represents deep-sea sediments (Thomas and Astini, 2003) that have typical \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO close to or above +30 \u2030 (Muehlenbachs, 1998), it is likely that the sediments subducted in this part of the arc had similarly high values. This interpretation is consistent with the results of Spencer et al. (2017) who showed that melting of subducted sediments in the mantle can produce igneous rocks with extremely high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO, up to +28\u2030. Interestingly, the resulting mixing curves also fit well the higher \u03b5Hf and lower \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of zircon-forming melts in Sierra de Famatina and Chaschuil. The proportions, averaging 10% and less than 5% respectively for the two zones exposing shallow crustal Famatinian magmatism, reflect a smaller contribution from sediments than for the deep-seated Valle F\u00e9rtil magmatism.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nBuilding the Famatinian arc magmatic columns from slab to surface\nThe Famatinian arc is marked by the coeval formation of large granitic batholiths and co-genetic rhyolites (e.g., the Chaschuil belt and parts of the Sierra de Famatina) having mantle-like isotopic signature and a lower crustal magmatic refinery (e.g., Valle F\u00e9rtil) with crust-like isotopic compositions along a \u223c600 km N-S arc strike. Such isotopic trends have been interpreted to result from the mixing between mantle basalts and the pre-existing host rocks, especially for the Valle F\u00e9rtil area, based notably on whole-rock Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and zircon Lu-Hf isotopes (Otamendi et al., 2017). However, we show here that Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic rocks have zircon \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values similar to those of the host rocks (e.g., zircon rims from the local migmatites and metapelites; literature values of pristine host rocks, \nFig. 5\n). Considering a scenario of mixing between mantle-derived basalts and melts from the pre-existing crust, these \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values of the zircons in the mafic rock imply that zircons would have crystallized almost entirely from the crustal melts. Such scenario seems highly unlikely as keeping at the same time the bulk rock composition mafic (e.g., analyzed samples are from norites to tonalites, see Supplementary Table 1) and having zircons formed only from small proportions of incorporated crustal melt would imply that this incorporation took place late during crystallization, at crystallinities much above the rheological lock-up threshold (preventing any possible mixing with silicic magmas). Furthermore, the zircon trace element contents in the Valle F\u00e9rtil samples are typical of those of mafic magmas and belong to a coherent differentiation trend from mafic to silicic magmas, ruling out abundant path contamination as a controlling process (\nFig. 2\n). Therefore, we argue here for the contamination of the mantle source by subducting sediments as the main process controlling the isotopic compositions of magmas (and zircon) in Valle F\u00e9rtil. This source contamination can be traced up to the more silicic lithologies sitting on top of the Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic zone (Otamendi et al., 2017). Although it was suggested that these evolved rocks were formed through mixing host rock melts and mantle magmas, they have \u03b5Hf ranging between \u22128 and \u22121 which are indiscernible from the Hf signature of the deeper mafic samples.\nAssuming that the zircon O-Hf isotopic variation observed at the scale of the entire arc results only from path contamination, the observed trend would require a drastic change of the proportion of assimilated to crystallized material along the arc axis. However, the Famatinian arc magmas were emplaced in compositionally monotonous country rocks along the entire arc segment (\nFig. 1\n), follow a similar liquid line of descent (\nFigs. 2\u20133\n), and were emplaced over a relatively short time interval (\nFig. 4\n), precluding significant lateral variations in path contamination. Additionally, mantle-like initial radiogenic 40Ca isotope values measured for a small suite of samples (n = 4) spanning the range of compositions found in the 3 magmatic localities also indicate that the host rock did not play a major role in the building of the main magmatic pulse (see supplementary Table 6, and Antonelli and Simon, 2020). We stress that our case for source contamination does not preclude \nsome\n path contamination, particularly for the older peripheral units dated at ca. 480 Ma in Chaschuil and the Sierra de Famatina (\nFigs. 2\u20134\n); and some magmas from Valle Fertil containing a few inherited zircons (\nFig. 4\n\n, Supplementary Material 4). We note that the older plutonic samples from the peripheral units in Chaschuil and the Sierra de Famatina fall on an alternate trend in the Mg# and ASI vs. SiO2 diagram (\nFig. 2\n), potentially indicating more significant interactions with the pre-existing host rocks. As such, we argue that this slightly older pulse may have partially shielded the mantle-derived magmas of the subsequent peak event from further interactions with pre-existing host rock (Storck et al., 2020).\nIn lights of our results, we argue for an alternative to the common view that considers assimilation of pre-existing crust en-route to the surface (i.e., path contamination) as the primary origin of chemical and isotopic diversity in arc magmas, (Hawkesworth and Kemp, 2006; Kemp et al., 2007; Spencer et al., 2022). Instead, we consider as equally likely the view of a magmatic column built from distilling mantle magmas, whereby the involvement of older crust, if any, happens through contamination of the mantle source, i.e., source contamination. These magmas evolve within a lower crustal mafic mush reservoir (e.g., the Valle F\u00e9rtil mafic zone, \nFigs. 2\u20133\n) where from the residual andesitic liquids rise upwards to form mid- to upper crustal reservoirs (e.g., the Valle F\u00e9rtil intermediate zone and Sierra de Famatina) (Bachmann and Huber, 2016 and reference therein). Depending on the thermal regime of the system that is tied to the mantle flux (Karakas et al., 2017), upper crustal granites and rhyolites may form (e.g., the Chaschuil belt) by extraction of highly differentiated liquids (Cornet et al., 2022 and reference therein).\nThe proposed dominant role of source contamination in shaping the zircon O-Hf isotopic trend of the Famatinian arc implies significant variations in along-arc-strike proportions of subducted sediments contaminating the mantle source (\nFig. 5\n\nc). This means that either the amount of subducted sediments or their contribution to mantle contamination changed along strike of the paleo-subduction zone, owing to different thermo-mechanical regimes along the slab. Paleogeographical models of Otamendi et al. (2020 and references therein) propose that the Cuyania terrane sediments (representative of the paleo-subducted sediments) thin towards the North, and virtually disappear at 28.3\u00b0S (Ramos, 2004). This would possibly indicate that the slab below the Chaschuil belt (\nFig. 1\n) was practically devoid of sediments. At this northern location, the slab end-member would be dominated by fluids from altered mafic rocks with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO much closer to mantle values (\n+\n3.5\n\u2013\n+\n6.0\n\u2030\n; e.g., Miller et al., 2001). Altogether, the variation in subducted sediment thickness from south to north is a plausible explanation for the observed counter-intuitive O-Hf isotopic trend.\nThe process of how slab and subducting sediments fluids\/melts enrich the overlying mantle wedge, and the proportion in which it varies along the arc strike, remains elusive. In an arc context, enriching a mantle source could take two forms: either (i) by partial melting of metasedimentary diapirs rising through the asthenospheric wedge (Marschall and Schumacher, 2012) or (ii) by destabilizing the hydrothermally altered layer of the subducting oceanic crust and the overlying sediments at >5 GPa, inducing the release of supercritical fluids (Ni et al., 2017). The maximum amount of contamination to keep the composition of an arc basalt should not exceed 20\u201325%, which are the maximum values inferred from our results on Valle F\u00e9rtil (\nFig. 5\n\nc). Therefore, supercritical fluids could have played a role as they resemble a melt enriched with volatile elements (30\u201370 wt% H2O, Ni et al., 2017) that are able to scavenge large quantities of usually immobile elements (such as hafnium, Kessel et al., 2005). Therefore, it can be speculated that the source magmas of Valle F\u00e9rtil could have been contaminated by supercritical fluids, able to change the isotopic composition of the primary arc magmas without drastically changing its major element composition.\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for the global O-Hf record and continental crust evolution\nThe global zircon record is characterized by an increasing diversity of O-Hf isotopic compositions with time. Specifically, after the onset of plate tectonics and the emergence of subaerial landmasses exposed to erosion ca. 3.0 to 2.5 Ga ago (Bindeman et al., 2018; Hawkesworth et al., 2020; Laurent et al., 2014), zircon shows both more scattered O-Hf isotopic compositions and, on average, higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO and lower \u03b5Hf than Hadean-Archean zircon (\nFig. 6\n\n\na and inset). As newly grown crust is thought to show strongly positive, DM-like Hf isotopic compositions (Dhuime et al., 2011), zircon with lower \u03b5Hf would reflect a contribution of pre-existing crust, possibly sediment-bearing whenever zircon shows elevated \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (Hawkesworth and Kemp, 2006). Therefore, these secular trends in zircon O-Hf isotopic composition have been commonly interpreted to reflect an increasingly important role of crustal melting over time, i.e. magma production via melting of sediment-bearing, thickened crust in collisional orogenic systems (Hawkesworth et al., 2010; Lackey et al., 2008). This served as a basis for models of crustal evolution, in which the timing of crustal growth is constrained by zircon Hf model ages (Belousova et al., 2010; Dhuime et al., 2012; Korenaga, 2018).\nHowever, we demonstrate here that zircon from the peak magmatic event of a single arc, formed over less than 6 Ma, encompass a zircon O-Hf isotopic variability comparable to that of the global zircon record in the last 2.5 billion years (\nFig. 6\n\nb). In the case of the Famatinian arc, this isotopic diversity was generated mainly through source contamination and with limited (ca. 5\u201325%) amounts of sedimentary material mixed with the mantle source. The Famatinian arc is unlikely to represent an isolated case, as magmas from several other convergent margin systems, including modern subduction zones (Lesser Antilles, e.g., Davidson, 1983; Sunda-Bunda arc; e.g., Gertisser et al., 2012; Aegean arc, Klaver et al., 2015) as well as older arcs (Roberts et al., 2013) orogenic belts (e.g., Couzini\u00e9 et al., 2016) and even ophiolites (Spencer et al., 2017) also show variations in isotopic signatures that are controlled by source contamination. All combined, this indicates that the isotopic diversity of the global <2.5 Ga-old zircon database must be significantly impacted by reworking of subducted sediments in the source of mantle-derived, convergent margin magmas, i.e., source contamination.\nThis interpretation is supported by the amplification of the O-Hf scatter and a trend towards heavier averaged O isotope compositions since \u223c2.5 Ga ago. Indeed, if arc magmas are the main building blocks of continents (Rudnick and Gao, 2003) and hence the main source of clastic sediments, these sediments (and in turn the magmas they contaminate during the subduction cycle) will lead to a progressive increase in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of igneous rock samples over the course of geologic time (\nFig. 7\n\n). Similarly, the radiogenic Hf isotopic record is expected to scatter more and more with time, as parts of the mantle become increasingly depleted (hence more positive in \u03b5Hf), while in others, less radiogenic material can be assimilated (hence more negative in \u03b5Hf), in variable proportions.\nOverlooking the importance of source contamination has likely skewed global crust evolution models towards an under-estimation of crustal growth over the past 2.5 Ga, for two main reasons.\n\n1.\nSome arc igneous rocks, contaminated at their mantle source by small amounts of sediments (as is the case for the Famatinian arc) may show \u201cnon-DM-like\u201d zircon O-Hf signatures (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n>\n+\n6.5\n\u2030\n; \n\u03b5\n\nHf\n\n<\n\u03b5\n\n\nHf\n\n\nDM\n\n\n), although they represent net crustal growth at their crystallization age (i.e. formed by >80% of mantle-derived material by mass; see also Couzini\u00e9 et al., 2016). These would be typically attributed to crustal reworking in global models, and in turn incorrectly assigned to \u201cancient\u201d crust formation (i.e. given by zircon Hf model ages) instead of \u201cinstantaneous\u201d growth (i.e. given by zircon U-Pb ages) (Belousova et al., 2010; Dhuime et al., 2012; Roberts and Spencer, 2015).\n\n\n2.\nSource contamination means that some fraction of reworked crust (in the form of sediments originating from weathering of arc magmas, Plank and Langmuir, 1998) is withdrawn from the slab and does not undergo recycling into the deeper mantle. This effect, generally not considered in the global balance between crustal growth and recycling (Scholl and von Huene, 2009; Stern and Scholl, 2010), could be non-negligible. For example, the Famatinian arc has between 5 and 25% by mass of sediment addition during the peak magmatic event, with a total magma flux of ca. 250\u2013300 km3.km\u22121.Ma\u22121 (Otamendi et al., 2020; Ducea et al., 2017). This translates into a flux of subducted sediments returning to the continental crust of 13 to 75 km3.km\u22121.Ma\u22121, clearly significant in light of the global, average subducted sediment flux (60 km3.km\u22121.Ma\u22121; Scholl and von Huene, 2009). Therefore, the interpretation that, in the context of modern plate tectonics, crustal growth being balanced or even outpaced by recycling (Scholl and von Huene, 2009), should be reconsidered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe geological processes recorded in 4-D in the Famatinian arc provides a unique window into the shaping of Earth's continental crust. Our results, supported by the geological layout of the area, provide compelling evidence for the building of continental arc magmatic columns from coeval fractionating mantle-derived mafic magmas. However, systematic variations in zircon O-Hf isotopic compositions of the Famatinian arc magmas are best explained by the variable incorporation of crustal material from subducted sediments along the N-S arc strike, hence revealing the key role of source contamination. By comparing our zircon isotopic data with O-Hf databases, we suggest that the addition of subducted sediments in magmas of arcs has been playing a non-negligible role in the global, secular isotopic trends shown by the continental crust (\nFigs. 6\u20137\n). We do not exclude the role of other mechanisms, such as assimilation of the overriding plate (\u201cpath\u201d contamination) and partial melting during collision and post-collisional stages (Moyen et al., 2021 and references therein). However, we emphasize here that the contribution of subducted sediments to arc magmas has the potential to (i) primarily generate the isotopic diversity typically attributed to path contamination; and (ii) conceal recent crustal growth, leading to overestimates of both crustal reworking and recycling through geologic time.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJulien Cornet was responsible of sample collection, processing, interpretation and writing of the article in the frame of his PhD thesis.\n\nM.

On long timescales, the field is axial dipole-dominated (Biggin et al., 2020) and exhibits irregular polarity reversals (e.g. Cande and Kent, 1992). However, despite significant recent progress (Panovska et al., 2019), global descriptions of the time-varying field morphology beyond the last 100 kyrs are hindered due to limitations in the spatio-temporal resolution of available data (Korte et al., 2018). The recent field is well characterised by satellite observations over the past 2 decades (e.g. Finlay et al., 2020) and by historical observations over the past 400 years (Jackson et al., 2000). The field morphology over this period, projected down to the core-mantle boundary (CMB), is dominated by two pairs of intense equatorially antisymmetric flux patches at high latitudes situated outside the tangent cylinder and drifting patches at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere. These features are a product of the dynamo process that generates the field in the liquid outer core.\nDynamo simulations provide a powerful tool for inferring links between the observable field at the CMB and the three-dimensional and time-dependent dynamics in Earth's core. The main limitation of these simulations is that they cannot yet employ realistic values of the physical properties of Earth's core (e.g. Wicht and Sanchez, 2019). Recent simulations have reached extreme conditions of low viscosity, rapid rotation and vigorous convection (e.g., Sheyko et al., 2016) and it has been argued that these may already represent the large-scale dynamics expected in Earth's core (e.g., Aubert et al., 2017). However, these simulations are scarce (the vast major of existing simulations use much more modest physical properties), and computationally expensive such that a systematic exploration of parameters at such extreme conditions is unlikely in the near future. Moreover, there is no guarantee that any given set of input parameters will produce a CMB field that resembles the modern geomagnetic field. A crucial question is therefore to establish how an Earth-like magnetic field morphology can be achieved.\nIn order to determine if a numerical dynamo simulation can be considered as \u201cEarth-like\u201d, two approaches are currently used. The first is to compare the magnetic field derived from numerical dynamo simulations to models of the observed field (Dormy et al., 2000; Christensen et al., 2010; Davies and Constable, 2014; Mound et al., 2015). We follow previous studies (Aubert et al., 2013; Davies and Constable, 2014; Mound et al., 2015; Christensen, 2018; Gastine et al., 2020) and employ the compliance criteria of Christensen et al. (2010), which determine the misfit between simulated and observed fields in terms of their axial dipole dominance, zonality, equatorial symmetry, and flux concentration factor (FCF). Christensen et al. (2010) suggested that acceptable misfits are obtained in a wedge-shaped region of the parameter space defined by the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, the ratio of magnetic advection and diffusion timescales, and \nE\n\/\n\nPm\n\n, the ratio of magnetic diffusion and rotational timescales where E is the Ekman number and Pm is the magnetic Prandtl number. However, Davies and Constable (2014) and Tassin et al. (2021) have found that simulations with \nE\n\/\n\nPm\n\n and Rm within the wedge may not produce simulated field morphologies with acceptably low misfit as defined by Christensen et al. (2010). Moreover, the compliance criteria only test the CMB field that is produced by the simulation; they do not consider the internal state of the dynamo.\nThe second method for assessing dynamo simulations is to compare the force balance output from the model against theoretical predictions (e.g. Davidson, 2013; Yadav et al., 2016; Aubert et al., 2017). In Earth's core, plausible values for the material properties strongly suggest that viscous and inertia forces are unimportant for the bulk dynamics. Recent high-resolution simulations (e.g., Aubert et al., 2017) have found that the large-scale force balance is quasi-geostrophic (QG) at leading order. At first order the expected balance is between Magneto-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) forces (Davidson, 2013; Aubert et al., 2017), and hence the dynamo is in QG-MAC balance. Schwaiger et al. (2019) surveyed a wide parameter range and found that dipole-dominated dynamos are generally in QG-MAC balance, while dynamos where the Lorentz force is replaced at first order by viscosity (QG-VAC balance) or inertia (QG-CIA balance) occur only near the onset of convection or when the CMB field loses dipole-dominance. Aubert et al. (2017) co-varied E, Pm and the convective forcing in simulations that follow a path determined by enforcing QG-MAC balance and invariance of Rm. Moving along the path towards Earth-like conditions they found increasing ratios of magnetic to kinetic energy and ohmic to viscous dissipation, which are expected on theoretical grounds (Davidson, 2013). Davies et al. (2022) pointed out that QG-MAC theory smoothly links the root-mean-square (RMS) magnetic field strength both in the bulk and at the CMB as well as the CMB dipole field strength between simulations and estimates for present-day Earth. However, while some QG-MAC dynamos have been shown to exhibit Earth-like magnetic fields according to the compliance test (Aubert et al., 2013, 2017), a systematic link between the dynamo dynamics, as measured by the force balance, and the observed field morphology, as measured by the compliance criteria, has yet to be established.\nIn this paper, we develop a direct link between the dynamo force balance and the observational field. A total of 67 simulations are used: 48 new cases and 19 cases from previous work (Mound et al., 2015; Sprain et al., 2019; Biggin et al., 2020; Meduri et al., 2021). Detailed analysis of these simulations is supplemented by literature data from Schwaiger et al. (2019). The new cases are produced by first extending the simulated path of Aubert et al. (2017) to larger values of E and Pm and then perturbing the input parameters about those suggested by the path theory. This allows us to simulate a range of dynamical behaviour without systematically sampling regions of parameter space that yield the QG-VAC balance, which is not relevant for Earth's core. We address the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between force balances and the morphological semblance with the modern geomagnetic field? 2) Can we determine conditions that produce Earth-like field morphology (as defined by the compliance criteria) and force balance (assumed to be QG-MAC) and relate these to input parameters for dynamo simulations? Finally, given that polarity reversals are a fundamental characteristic of the geomagnetic field, we briefly consider the behaviour of reversing simulations that produce both an Earth-like dipolarity (the ratio of dipole magnetic energy to magnetic energy up to spherical harmonic degree 12 on the outer boundary), Rm, and force balance.\n\n\n2\nModel description\n\n2.1\nNumerical dynamo simulations\nWe numerically solve the Boussinesq equations of the magnetohydrodynamic dynamo in a rotating spherical shell using the code described in Willis et al.

The ratio of inner to outer radii is set to 0.35 throughout.\nTwo series of numerical simulations are performed: (1) pure thermal driving and (2) thermo-chemical driving. In pure thermally driven cases, the boundary conditions are fixed flux (\n\n\nF\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\/\n\n\nr\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n and \n\n\nF\n\n\no\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\/\n\n\nr\n\n\no\n\n\n2\n\n\n) and there is no source-sink term because we assume no radioactive heating or secular cooling (Davies and Gubbins, 2011). A few cases include a heterogeneous outer boundary condition with amplitude (\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nq\n\n\n) given as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nq\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nF\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\nF\n\n\no\n\n\n is the heat flow across the outer boundary, \n\n\nF\n\n\nmax\n\n\n is the maximum boundary heat flow and \n\n\nF\n\n\nmin\n\n\n is the minimum boundary heat flow. The pattern of heterogeneity is taken from the tomographic model of Masters et al. (2000).\nFor thermo-chemically-driven cases, we follow Aubert et al. (2013). The mean co-density flux at the outer boundary is zero, while the amplitude of the (purely thermal) outer boundary heterogeneity is modelled by using \n\u0394\nq\n=\n1.5\n\n\nq\n\n\nad\n\n\n and an adiabatic heat flow of \n\n\nq\n\n\nad\n\n\n=\n11\n TW in Eq.

The magnetic Reynolds number in Earth's core ranges from 400 to 4000 (Aubert et al., 2017). Here, we use \n\u3008\n\nRm\n\n\u3009\n=\n500\n as the threshold for an Earth-like magnetic Reynolds number based on the minimum constraints from the core surface flow model (e.g., Holme, 2015), where \n\u3008\n\u2026\n\u3009\n denotes the time-averaged value.\nIn order to estimate the relevant force balance in numerical dynamo simulations, we compute the spectrum of each force as a function of radius following Aubert et al. (2017) and Schwaiger et al. (2019):\n\n(10)\n\n\n\nF\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nl\n=\n0\n\n\nlmax\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\ni\n,\nl\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nl\n=\n0\n\n\nlmax\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nm\n=\n0\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\ni\n,\n\nlm\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n where \n\n\nF\n\n\ni\n,\n\nlm\n\n\n\n is the spectral form of each force (\ni\n=\nV\n: viscous; \ni\n=\nI\n: inertia; \ni\n=\nL\n: Lorentz; \ni\n=\nC\n: Coriolis; \ni\n=\nB\n; buoyancy; \ni\n=\nP\n: pressure) and \n\n\nl\n\n\nmax\n\n\n is the maximum truncation degree of spherical harmonic order in the numerical dynamo simulations. The force balance spectra across the bulk fluid layer are obtained by integrating Eq. (10) radially, excluding the viscous boundary layers at the top and bottom of the fluid layer (Aubert et al., 2017). The thickness of the viscous boundary layers, \n\n\nd\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n, is defined by the peaks in the radial profile of horizontal velocity near the boundary (King et al., 2013). The forces are analysed as a function of spherical harmonic degree l rather than order m as explained in Aubert (2019).\nUsing equation (10), we can define quantities that directly measure the force balance, following Schwaiger et al. (2019). First, the strong-fieldness \u03b4 quantifies the amplitude difference between the Lorentz force and the larger of the viscous and inertial forces:\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b4\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nl\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nL\n,\nl\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nl\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\nmax\n\u2061\n(\n\n\nF\n\n\nI\n,\nl\n\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\nF\n\n\nV\n,\nl\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n Larger \u03b4 indicates a larger disparity between Lorentz force and both inertial and viscous effects, and hence a greater adherence to QG-MAC balance. Second, \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n represents the difference between the scale \n\n\nl\n\n\npol\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n=\nmax\n\u2061\n(\n\n\nE\n\n\nK\n,\nl\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n)\n at which the poloidal kinetic energy spectrum \n\n\nE\n\n\nK\n,\nl\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n peaks and the scale \n\n\nl\n\n\nMAC\n\n\n at which QG-MAC balance is achieved, normalised by the minimum difference between \n\n\nl\n\n\npol\n\n\n and the scales \n\n\nl\n\n\nVAC\n\n\n and \n\n\nl\n\n\nCIA\n\n\n at which VAC and CIA balance are achieved:\n\n(12a)\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nMAC\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\u2061\n(\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nCIA\n\n\n,\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nVAC\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n where\n\n(12b)\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\n\nr\n\n\ni\n\n\n+\n\n\nd\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nd\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\npol\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\u2212\n\n\nl\n\n\ni\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\npol\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\nd\nr\n)\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n Here \n\n\nl\n\n\ni\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n is the crossing degree of two force spectra (\ni\n=\n\nMAC\n\n: Lorentz and buoyancy; \ni\n=\n\nCIA\n\n: inertia-buoyancy; \ni\n=\n\nVAC\n\n: Viscous-buoyancy) defined in Eqs. (16) to (18) in Schwaiger et al. (2019). Based on the results of Schwaiger et al. (2019), we expect that lower \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n indicates that the characteristic flow scale approaches \n\n\nl\n\n\nMAC\n\n\n and diverges from the scales where either VAC or CIA balances dominate.\nBoth \u03b4 and \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n are direct measures of the dominant force balance in the dynamo, while M is a convenient proxy for the ratio of Lorentz and inertial forces that is easier to calculate and more commonly output in dynamo simulations. Here we will compare the three quantities directly. The QG-MAC balance is approached when \n\u3008\n\u03b4\n\u3009\n>\n1\n, \n\u3008\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n\u3009\n<\n1\n and \n\u3008\nM\n\u3009\n>\n1\n (Schwaiger et al., 2019). Unless otherwise stated, all derived quantities (e.g. energies, force balance, etc) are computed at each time point before averaging over time.\nIn reversing simulations, it is important for consistency to compute force balance spectra over stable and transitional periods separately. We define stable polarity periods as times when the magnitude of the dipole tilt angle (\n\u2212\n90\n\u2264\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u2264\n90\n) exceeds 45 degrees. Our focus is on times of stable polarity, which we analyse in section 3.1. In section 3.2 we briefly consider reversing behaviour in the QG-MAC regime.\nFor assessing how numerical dynamo simulations resemble the observed geomagnetic field, we use the criteria proposed by Christensen et al. (2010). This test is composed of computing misfit based on four quantities: axial dipole dominance, \n\nAD\n\n\/\n\nNAD\n\n; odd-even ratio, \nO\n\/\nE\n; zonality, \nZ\n\/\n\nNZ\n\n; and flux concentration factor, FCF. Those values are computed with the gauss coefficients truncated at spherical harmonic degree 8. The misfit of each parameter is computed as:\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\n\nln\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\nln\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\nM\n\n\n\n\nln\n\u2061\n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\n are the computed values of each criterion (\ni\n=\n\nAD\n\n\/\n\nNAD\n\n,\nO\n\/\nE\n,\nZ\n\/\n\nNZ\n\n,\n\nFCF\n\n), \n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\nM\n\n\n is the corresponding value for the geomagnetic field, and \n\n\n\u03a0\n\n\ni\n\n\nS\n\n\n is the standard deviation estimated from time-dependent and statistical field models (see Table 2 in Christensen et al., 2010). Based on the total misfit \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n, simulations are categorized as excellent (\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2264\n2\n), good (\n2\n<\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2264\n4\n), marginal (\n4\n<\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2264\n8\n) or non-compliant (\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n>\n8\n).\nThe original compliance criteria were applied by averaging each misfit measure over approximately 30 advection times, corresponding to around 5000 yrs (Christensen et al., 2010). Mound et al. (2015) showed that the individual \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n can vary substantially over the duration of a simulation and so care is needed when comparing to the modern geomagnetic field. In order to do that, we compute \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n at each time point and then average over time windows over different lengths (excluding the initial transient). We divide the time-series into N windows of equal length and focus on windows of 400 years, the length of the historical record, but also consider other window lengths. Finally, the total misfit is quoted for the window where \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n takes its minimum value. This procedure for choosing an \u2018optimum\u2019 window reflects the fact that time in the simulation is arbitrary, hence, any 400-yr window can be tested against the observed field.\nAs a final measure of the surface field morphology, we compute the dipolarity \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n, defined as the ratio of the RMS CMB dipole field strength to the RMS strength of the CMB field truncated up to degree 12 (Christensen and Aubert, 2006). Davies et al. (2022) argued that, over the timescales spanned by dynamo simulations, the value of \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n for the geomagnetic field should lie in the range 0.35\u20130.75. This range encompasses the values of 0.64 and \n0.7\n\u00b1\n0.3\n for the satellite and historical fields respectively, rules out weakly and viscously-controlled dynamos that produce anomalously high \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n, and also omits dynamos that are clearly in the multipolar regime (Christensen and Aubert, 2006).\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nWe calculate compliance criteria and force balance spectra for 48 new simulations (37 purely thermally-driven and 11 thermo-chemically-driven) plus 19 (all pure thermally-driven) previously published simulations (Mound et al., 2015; Sprain et al., 2019; Biggin et al., 2020; Meduri et al., 2021). A case summary is provided in the supplemental material (Table S1). Briefly, the input parameters are \n120\n\u2264\n\n\nRa\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\u2264\n2400\n, \n0.78125\n\u2264\n\nPm\n\n\u2264\n50\n and \n7.8125\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n\u2264\nE\n\u2264\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n. Fourteen of these cases (LEDT001 to LEDT007 and LEDT038 to LEDT044) are designed to approximately follow the path theory of Aubert et al. (2017), in which the parameters are defined such that\n\n(14)\n\n\n\nRa\n\n\nF\n\n\n=\n\u03f5\n\n\nRa\n\n\nF\n0\n\n\n;\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nPm\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPm\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n Here \u03f5 is the path parameter, \n\n\nRa\n\n\nF\n\n\n is the flux Rayleigh number \n\n\nRa\n\n\nF\n\n\n=\n\n\nRa\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n\n\n(\nE\n\/\n\nPr\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n, and we set \n\n\nE\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n (reference Ekman number) and \n\n\nPm\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n50\n (reference magnetic Prandtl number). By using the relationship between flux Rayleigh number and modified Rayleigh number with \n\nPr\n\n=\n1\n, the modified Rayleigh number has the relationship: \n\n\nRa\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nRa\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n where \n\n\nRa\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n=\n120\n is the reference modified Rayleigh number. The other 32 cases randomly select the input parameters within the range shown above.\nAll simulations use a spatial resolution from 96 to 192 radial grid points and truncation of up to 96 to 128 spherical harmonic degree, depending on the combination of input parameters. Time integrations are performed for between 100 and 10000 advection times (\n\n\nt\n\n\nadv\n\n\n=\n\n\nt\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\nD\n\/\nU\n), where an Earth-like advection time is around 150 yrs (Christensen et al., 2010). This time integration period spans Holocene to Myr timescales, which is sufficient to compare outputs to the modern geomagnetic field. Several simulations include polarity reversals, which are monitored by using the dipole tilt angle. To ensure consistency between non-reversing and reversing cases, we avoid taking averages over times including polarity reversals.\n\n3.1\nRelationship between field morphology and force balance\n\nFig. 1\n shows the force balance spectra in the bulk fluid for typical cases that represent the QG-MAC (LEDT042) and QG-CIA (LEDT047) regimes. Also shown are maps of the radial magnetic field \n\n\nB\n\n\nr\n\n\n at the outer boundary of the simulation from the 400-yr window with minimum value of total misfit of compliance criteria. In the QG-MAC dynamo (Fig. 1a), the ordering of the forces is the same as obtained by Schwaiger et al. (2019) and Aubert (2019, Fig. 2) whose terminology we follow. At leading order, geostrophic balance occurs at low harmonic degrees and is replaced by a magnetostrophic balance at high degree. At first order the MAC balance is achieved at spherical harmonic degree \n\n\nl\n\n\nMAC\n\n\n\u223c\n10\n; below this scale the (vorticity) balance is characterised by a thermal wind, while above this scale a magnetic wind prevails. Inertial effects balance buoyancy and what remains of the Coriolis effect at harmonic degree \n\n\nl\n\n\nCIA\n\n\n\u223c\n20\n. The separation between Lorentz and inertial forces is around 1 order of magnitude at the large scales, which is lower than the scale separation that arises at lower \nE\n\/\n\nPm\n\n (e.g., Aubert, 2019). This simulation provides a good match to the modern geomagnetic field, with a dominantly dipolar and equatorially anti-symmetric field including intense high-latitude flux patches. In the QG-CIA dynamo (Fig. 1b), the zeroth and first order balances are the same as found by Schwaiger et al. (2019), with some differences emerging at smaller scales. In particular, the example in Fig. 1b achieves QG-VAC balance around \n\n\nl\n\n\nVAC\n\n\n=\n50\n before achieving a QG-MAC balance at higher degrees, while the example in Schwaiger et al. (2019) does not achieve QG-VAC or QG-MAC balance at any spherical harmonic degree. The surface field for this case is strongly dipolar (high \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n) and does not comply with the morphology of the geomagnetic field. We have found another branch of the QG-CIA dynamo with low \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n (see below), but the spectra show that the ordering of the force balances is the same between the two cases.\n\nFig. 2\n shows \n\u3008\n\u03b4\n\u3009\n, \n\u3008\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n\u3009\n, and \n\u3008\nM\n\u3009\n, all evaluated in the bulk fluid, as a function of \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n with the colour bar indicating the value of \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n in the 400-yr window corresponding to a minimum \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n. Literature data taken from Schwaiger et al. (2019) is also plotted. QG-MAC balance arises when \n\u3008\n\u03b4\n\u3009\n>\n1\n, \n\u3008\nM\n\u3009\n>\n1\n, \n\u3008\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n\u3009\n<\n1\n as shown by the dashed lines and is more strongly enforced as \n\u3008\n\u03b4\n\u3009\n and \n\u3008\nM\n\u3009\n increase above 1 and as \n\u3008\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n\u3009\n decreases below 1. The blue shaded region delineates the simulations that produce both global QG-MAC balance and \n0.35\n\u2264\n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n\u2264\n0.75\n.\nFour main findings emerge from Fig. 2. First, morphological compliance with the modern geomagnetic field does not imply a single underlying force balance: low \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n values are obtained in both QG-MAC and QG-CIA regimes. However, the low \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n QG-CIA models appear close to the transition to QG-MAC, generally have low Rm, and produce either too low or too high \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n compared to modern Earth. Therefore, these simulations are not representative of Earth's core dynamo. Second, QG-MAC balance does not imply low \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n. In particular, QG-MAC cases with high and low \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n provide poor agreement with Earth's modern field and are not guaranteed to yield high Rm. Third, the two previous findings do not appear to be affected by the degree to which a single force balance dominates. For example, increasing \u03b4, \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n or M (i.e. greater adherence to QG-MAC balance) does not produce a systematic trend in \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n. Finally, there appears to be a range of \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n that is broadly consistent with the range suggested independently by Davies et al. (2022) in which the majority of simulations are characterized by QG-MAC balance, good or excellent morphological semblance, and high Rm. Remarkably, the single parameter \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n appears to provide a reasonable proxy for all three of these desirable characteristics.\nTo assess the effect of averaging on \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n, Fig. 3\n plots \n\u3008\n\u03b4\n\u3009\n (evaluated in the bulk fluid) as a function of \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n with the colour bar indicating the minimum value of \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n obtained with no time windowing, and time windowing spanning 400 years, 1000 years, and the total length of the simulation. In all four cases, the individual compliance criteria are computed at each time step before averaging, as in Christensen et al. (2010). \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n increases with the length of averaging, which is expected because the simulated field morphologies vary significantly over timescales greater than the historical period. Large temporal variations in \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n have previously been found in both dynamo simulations (Mound et al., 2015) and time-dependent field models spanning the period 10-100 ka (Panovska et al., 2019); indeed, the need for appropriate averaging when applying the compliance criteria was recognised in the original study by Christensen et al. (2010). After 1000 yrs of averaging we observe a roughly equal partitioning between dipolar models (\n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n>\n0.35\n) with good\/excellent compliance and those with marginal\/poor compliance, similar to results in Christensen et al. (2010) for the case of a fixed flux outer boundary. When averaged over their whole duration, most simulations display marginal or non-compliance with the modern geomagnetic field. Nevertheless, on millennial and sub-millennial timescales Fig. 3 shows that the main features identified in Fig. 2 are preserved.\n\n\n3.2\nPreliminary links to polarity reversals\nPolarity reversals are a fundamental characteristic of geomagnetic secular variation (e.g., Valet and Fournier, 2016) and should therefore be represented in any Earth-like dynamo model. The large computational costs required to simulate the long time-scales associated with reversals (and other diagnostics of paleomagnetic field behaviour) mean that it is currently not feasible to undertake the systematic analysis presented in Section 3.1 above using only reversing simulations. Nevertheless, it is important to identify whether the intermediate \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n regime in Fig. 2 contains reversing dynamos and, if so, the behaviour of the force balance during the reversal. Our simulation suite contains 5 reversing simulations that maintain QG-MAC balance and \n0.35\n\u2264\n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n\u2264\n0.75\n (Table S1), but none of these also satisfy both high \n\nRm\n\n(\n\u223c\n1000\n)\n and a good or excellent (\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n<\n4\n) compliance with the modern field morphology on 100\u20131000 year timescales. We focus on the case LEDT002, which has \n\nRm\n\n=\n1185\n but does not achieve \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n<\n4\n in any window of \u2265400 years, though it does achieve \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n4.95\n at a single instant in time.\n\nFig. 4\n shows the time variations of the energy ratio M, dipolarity \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n, and dipole tilt angle as a function of time. Fig. 3a shows that M remains above 2 for the whole duration of the simulation, indicating that both the stable and transitional dynamo are likely to be in QG-MAC balance. On the other hand, M is reduced during transitions compared to times of stable polarity, suggesting an increased role of inertia during the reversal. The variations in M are due to a decrease in the magnetic energy, while kinetic energy remains relatively constant in time. The strong-fieldness \u03b4 remains relatively stable and larger than 7 through the reversal, while \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\nnorm\n\n\n is generally below 0.1 aside from a handful of instantaneous \u2018spikes\u2019 where it reaches \nO\n(\n1\n)\n (see Fig. 5\n). Reversals (seen by the tilt angle of dipole latitude in Fig. 4b) also correspond to times of smaller \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n (Fig. 4a), which is consistent with previous studies (e.g., Menu et al., 2020). The decrease in \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n arises due to a strong decrease in the energy of dipole field, though the energy of the whole outer boundary field also drops during the reversal, consistent with the overall decrease in magnetic energy.\n\nFig. 6\n shows force balance spectra and the radial magnetic field at the outer boundary taken at selected times before, during and after the polarity reversal in Fig. 4. The force balance spectra (left of Fig. 6), show that the relative ordering of the forces is preserved through the reversal. The field morphology (right of Fig. 6 directly before and after the reversal is dipole-dominated, but not well-compliant with the modern geomagnetic field (see Table S1); however, any such agreement would perhaps be coincidental since the current geomagnetic field has remained in stable polarity for over 700 kyrs and shows no clear signs of reversing.\nTo further investigate the reversing dynamo behaviour, Fig. 7\n shows the ratio of Lorentz to inertial force spectra, \n\n\nF\n\n\nI\n,\nl\n\n\n\/\n\n\nF\n\n\nL\n,\nl\n\n\n, as a function of time spanning the reversal shown in Fig. 4. During the reversal this ratio is increased to \u223c0.3 to 0.4 across the largest scales \nl\n\u2248\n1\n\u2212\n10\n, which is consistent with the results of Tassin et al. (2021) who considered the force balance at the scale \n\n\nl\n\n\npol\n\n\n. The RMS amplitude of the Lorentz force (not shown) drops by about a factor of 1.5 between the times \n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n to \n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n and so we suspect that the change in \n\n\nF\n\n\nI\n\n\n\/\n\n\nF\n\n\nL\n\n\n is predominantly due to a weakening of the Lorentz force preceding the main phase of the reversal rather than an increase in the strength of the inertial term. This view is supposed by the observation that magnetic energy changes more than kinetic energy between \n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n and \n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n. Therefore, while this dynamo remains in QG-MAC balance according to the definition based on M, this balance is significantly perturbed by inertial effects. Tassin et al. (2021) argue that this inertia force elevation would not be likely to arise in Earth's core, which seems plausible given current theoretical understanding of the dynamo (Davidson, 2013) but is impossible to probe directly for Earth's core because the large-scale force spectrum is unobservable. In any case, the purpose here is simply to show that reversing dynamos exist in the region of parameter space where QG-MAC balance, high Rm and Earth-like \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n are simultaneously achieved (blue shaded region in Fig. 2). A large suite of reversing dynamos that sample this regime will help to elucidate the role of inertia in governing polarity changes.\n\n\n3.3\nAsymptotic input parameters for Earth-like dynamos\nWe have shown that the dipolarity \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n provides a reasonable proxy for dynamo simulations that comply with Earth's modern field morphology, magnetic Reynolds number and expected force balance. However, \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n is an output of a geodynamo simulation and so it is of practical use to assess whether Earth-like dynamos (in the sense just described) can be predicted based on the input parameters, specifically E, Pm and \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n. Our simulation dataset uses moderate values of these input parameters that are far from Earth's core and so we also must consider whether the results may change as more realistic conditions are approached.\n\nFig. 8\n plots all cases in Table S1 as a function of flux Rayleigh number \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n and \nE\n\/\n\nPm\n\n with filling colour showing the optimal \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n value in Fig. 2. Upper and lower dashed lines show the uni-dimensional paths used in this study (upper) and in Aubert et al. (2017) (lower), which are computed by Eq. (14). In our case, \n\n\nRa\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n=\n120\n with \n\n\nE\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n but \n\n\nRa\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u204e\n\n\n=\n450\n for extrapolating the path provided by Aubert et al. (2017) with \nE\n=\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n. The difference between our path and Aubert et al.'s path is around a factor of four, corresponding the shaded region in Fig. 8. This difference is caused by the choice of starting condition of both paths. Fig. 8 shows that choosing input parameters close to those defined by a uni-dimensional path based on QG-MAC theory is a promising strategy for obtaining simulated fields that comply with Earth's modern field without needing to systematically sample parameter space. Note that Fig. 8 includes all of our simulations; however, due to the choice of input parameters, some cases overlap. The detailed information can be found in Table S1.\n\nFig. 9\n plots the fraction \n\n\nf\n\n\nohm\n\n\n of the total dissipation that is ohmic against the flux Rayleigh number \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n with minimum \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n based on 400-yr averages shown in colours. Simulations near the \u201cpath\u201d parameters defined by Eq. (14) generally produce the highest \n\n\nf\n\n\nohm\n\n\n at a given \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n and correspond to the lower end of the \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n values. Decreasing \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n (towards Earth core conditions) leads to an increase in \n\n\nf\n\n\nohm\n\n\n (Aubert et al., 2017), but this does not imply that \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n remains low, as expected from Fig. 2.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur analysis of 67 numerical dynamos shows that simulations in QG-MAC balance generally provide good to excellent morphological agreement with the modern geomagnetic field within an intermediate range of dipolarity values that are broadly consistent with the range inferred for Earth's core independently of our simulation dataset (Davies et al., 2022). In fact, the majority of simulations exhibiting good or excellent compliance sit within the narrower range \n0.55\n\u2264\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u2264\n0.75\n, demonstrating that dipolarity provides a strong constraint on dynamo behaviour. Conversely, simulations in QG-CIA balance (the only other dynamical regime to appear in our simulations) tend to produce low Rm, marginal- to non-compliant field morphologies, and dipolarities outside the range inferred by Davies et al. (2022). Below we consider how these results may depend on the methods used to compare simulations to observations and for estimating the dominant dynamics of the dynamo.\nTo compare simulated and observed fields we have relied on the compliance criteria of Christensen et al. (2010). The values of these criteria (and associated uncertainties) for Earth were selected by considering geomagnetic behaviour across the historical period (gufm-1; Jackson et al., 2000 and IGRF models https:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/IAGA\/vmod\/igrf.html)), as well as the Holocene (the CALS7k.2 model of Korte and Constable, 2005) and statistical models of the paleo-magnetic field spanning the last few million years. A new time-dependent spherical harmonic model for the last 100 kyrs (reviewed in Panovska et al., 2019) has become available, which can in principle be compared to numerical simulations. However, such comparisons must be conducted with care because of the differing spatio-temporal resolution of field models spanning different timescales. Panovska et al. (2019) show that the IGRF, CALS10k.2 Holocene model (Constable et al., 2016), and 100 kyr GGF model all give similar values for Z\/NZ, O\/E and FCF when truncated at degree 5, while AD\/NAD varies by a factor of 4. Furthermore, all quantities are sensitive to the degree of truncation as Christensen et al. (2010) also noted. Future work is needed to critically evaluate different frameworks for comparing simulations to this new generation of time-dependent field models. Potential directions could utilize the PSV activity index (e.g. Panovska et al., 2019) or the form of the spatial power spectrum (Davies and Constable, 2014).\nIn addition to the compliance criteria, there are other characteristics of Earth's magnetic field that could be used to test numerical simulations (e.g. Davies and Constable, 2014; Sprain et al., 2019). Christensen et al. (2010) provide detailed arguments against adopting criteria based on the magnetic field strength, westward drift, or the apparently quasi-stationary high-latitude flux patches that are prominent in the modern field. Another consideration is the hemispheric pattern of secular variation that has been robustly revealed by satellite observations (e.g., Holme et al., 2011). This pattern has been reproduced in geodynamo simulations with heterogeneous boundary heat flow (Aubert et al., 2013; Mound et al., 2015) and has also been argued to arise from lateral variations in lower mantle electrical conductivity (Dumberry and More, 2020). Mound et al. (2015) proposed a measure of secular variation hemisphericity, \n\n\nH\n\n\nSV\n\n\n, similar to the compliance criteria of Christensen et al. (2010). However, simulations with homogeneous boundary conditions tend to produce a poor match to Earth's \n\n\nH\n\n\nSV\n\n\n (Aubert et al., 2013). Since we have focused on homogeneous models, we have not considered this criterion further, but note that it should be included as larger datasets containing both homogeneous and heterogeneous dynamos are produced.\nOn longer timescales, it is desirable to assess the compliance between simulations and the paleomagnetic field. Such comparisons cannot be conducted using the compliance criteria because spherical harmonic field models are not available for timescales greater than 100 kyrs, so other approaches such as the QPM (Quality Paleo-magnetic Model) framework are required (Sprain et al., 2019; Meduri et al., 2021). One challenge that we have demonstrated using a large simulation dataset is that reversals in QG-MAC dynamos are seldom observed, either because the simulations do not access the dipole-reversing regime or because they cannot be run for long enough to observe polarity changes. By combining large datasets such as used in Tassin et al. (2021) and the present paper, it may be possible to conduct systematic comparisons between dynamo models and the paleo-magnetic field.\nTo assess the dynamo force balance we have only discussed quantities as a function of spherical harmonic degree l. Schwaiger et al. (2019) obtained some simulations where the dominant force balance varied with radius, changing from QG-MAC in the bulk to QG-CIA near the outer boundary. We have verified that force balance spectra calculated by integrating over the bulk and by direct evaluation on the spherical surface corresponding to the base of the upper velocity boundary layer provide consistent estimates for the leading order and first order force balances. A further refinement that could be investigated in the future is to decompose the dependent variables and associated forces into mean and fluctuating components (Calkins et al., 2021). This approach allows to separately evaluate the relationship between the observed field and large- and small-scale force balances but requires a more complex analysis procedure that we have not attempted.\nFuture work should test our results with simulations carried out at more extreme values of E, Pm and \nR\n\n\na\n\n\nF\n\n\n. Other simulation configurations should also be investigated. Our simulations employ the geophysically relevant no-slip velocity boundary conditions with fixed co-density flux on the inner and outer boundaries. We have also varied the ratio of internal to basal buoyancy driving, which is a significant unknown in the core (Davies and Gubbins, 2011), though only two configurations have been tested. Tassin et al. (2021) found a dependence of the compliance test results on buoyancy distribution by systematically varying the ratio of thermal to compositional driving. However, despite a different simulation setup and method for computing \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n, their results reveal that excellent morphological semblance (\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n<\n2\n) is obtained almost exclusively in the QG-MAC regime (one outlying case has \nM\n\u2248\n0.8\n) and with \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n in the range \n0.55\n\u2212\n0.8\n, in good agreement with our findings. We therefore conclude that our results are not strongly sensitive to the buoyancy distribution in the parameter space that has been systematically studied to date.\nFinally, we note that both \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n and AD\/NAD measure the degree of dipole dominance, and hence the intermediate \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n regime we have identified could potentially be recast in terms of AD\/NAD. We have chosen to use \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n as it is a commonly reported diagnostic in dynamo studies. Our finding that QG-MAC balance, high Rm and low \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n simultaneously arise in a range of \n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n should enable existing simulations with these desirable properties to be easily identified.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe have run 67 numerical dynamo simulations to investigate links between the internal magnetohydrodynamic processes in Earth's core and the properties of the observable magnetic field. The order of forces in the dynamo have been estimated using the force balance spectra introduced by Aubert et al. (2017) and the morphological semblance between simulated and observed magnetic fields has been calculated using the \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n compliance criteria of Christensen et al. (2010). Our conclusions are as follows:\n\n1.\nBoth QG-MAC and QG-CIA dynamos can produce acceptable agreement with the modern geomagnetic field and so both the dynamo force balance and the characteristics of the surface field must be checked before making comparisons to Earth. However, the low \n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n2\n\n\n QG-CIA models appear close to the transition to QG-MAC balance, have low magnetic Reynolds number compared to Earth's core, and produce a dipolarity \n\u3008\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u3009\n that is either too low or too high compared to the range \n0.35\n\u2264\n\n\nf\n\n\ndip\n\n\n\u2264\n0.75\n estimated by Davies et al. (2022) for the recent geomagnetic field.

There continues to be great debate over the age of onset of plate tectonics, and whether it has operated continuously since formation of the first crust, or was presaged by some other type of tectonic behaviour. In the modern \u201cmobile lid\u201d or plate tectonic geodynamic mode, plate movements at the Earth's surface are strongly coupled to mantle convection. Other modes of mantle convection suggested to occur on other planets and moons, however, do not involve the surface layer and are thus termed \u201cstagnant-lid\u201d or \u201csluggish-lid\u201d (Stern et al., 2018). Whether Earth had such a geodynamic regime soon after its formation, or if it experienced a return to such a state after plate tectonics had been initiated, remains an open and much-debated question.\nPerceived to be characterized by a \u201cboring billion\u201d years of climatic stasis (Holland, 2006), the mid-Proterozoic (ca. 1.85\u20130.85 Ga) is an interval of geological time that is clearly peculiar, and thus presents a likely candidate for a potential respite from plate tectonics in Earth history. The Earth's tectonic mode during the Mesoproterozoic (the era from 1.6 to 1.0 Ga that comprises most of the informal mid-Proterozoic time interval) has been questioned recently, with hypotheses including \u201corogenic quiescence\u201d (Tang et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2022) and \u201csingle-lid tectonics\u201d (Piper, 2013; Stern, 2020). Other researchers recognize mild tectonic reorganization between the supercontinents Columbia (a.k.a. Nuna) and Rodinia (Roberts, 2013; Ernst et al., 2016), and a different style of hot and thin orogenesis (Spencer et al., 2021), but do not question the vitality of orogenesis nor the plate tectonic regime during this time. Thus, the most basic and pressing question is to assess whether the most extreme of these hypotheses \u2013 a temporary return to single-lid (or \u2018stagnant-lid\u2019) tectonics \u2013 can be refuted or not. Then, and only then, can arguably more elaborate hypotheses regarding the mid-Proterozoic be postulated.\nHere, based on the backdrop of recent studies, we take an iterative approach to hypothesis testing to explain the mid-Proterozoic geological record. As we define them, we test two hypotheses \u2013 the first, that plate tectonics existed throughout the mid-Proterozoic, and the second, a single-lid model. The appeal of the plate tectonic hypothesis is its consistency with subsequent geologic history and known, uniformitarian processes. The appeal of the single-lid hypothesis is both its mechanistic simplicity and its potentially unique ability to explain the aberrations of the mid-Proterozoic geological record. Ultimately, after assessing different lines of evidence from the extant geological record, we offer a synoptic view, that in our opinion offers the best explanation for the style of mid-Proterozoic tectonics.\n\n\n2\nMethods\nEach mid-Proterozoic dataset will be examined within the context of both hypotheses. It is debatable which should be regarded as a \u201cnull\u201d hypothesis: on the one hand, the null hypothesis may be the simplest single-lid hypothesis as recently proposed for mid-Proterozoic time (Stern, 2020); on the other hand, as most geologists would agree that plate tectonics has been operational since at least late Neoproterozoic time (Hamilton, 1998; Stern, 2005; Cawood et al., 2006), it may also be regarded as the null hypothesis on the grounds of uniformitarianism. We therefore entertain both hypotheses and assess which explanation is most compelling. After doing so for each individual dataset, we finally synthesize the individual assessments to produce a coherent collective tectonic interpretation.\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nPaleomagnetism and continental drift\nPaleomagnetism offers a quantitative test of plate tectonics. The paleomagnetic database of robust mid-Proterozoic poles is constantly growing (Evans et al., 2021), with some cratons such as Baltica and Laurentia having several robust poles, while others such as Kalahari still have few poles constraining their position. The current dataset for the mid-Proterozoic interval allows for broad paleogeographic reconstructions of the assembly and breakup of the Columbia (e.g., Elming et al., 2021) and Rodinia supercontinents (e.g., Evans, 2021). However, because several cratons are lacking robust poles, it is not possible to reconstruct the complete configuration of Columbia, and several cratons have debated positions (e.g., Evans, 2021; Elming et al., 2021). Despite this, there is some consensus as to the relative configuration of the core cratons of Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and those of proto-Australia through the Columbia to Rodinia supercontinent cycle. Other cratons such as Amazonia are debated, with some models having it located within the core of Columbia adjacent to Baltica \u2013 the South AMerica - BAltica (SAMBA) connection (Johansson, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012; Bispo-Santos et al., 2020); whereas alternative models have it excluded from Columbia (Pisarevsky et al., 2014; Elming et al., 2021).\nWe reconstruct the Columbia supercontinent and its transition to Rodinia in Fig. 1\na. The broad timing of the different phases of the Columbia\u2013Rodinia supercontinent transition are taken as such: Columbia assembly lasted from 1.9 to 1.6 Ga, ending with the suturing of Australia to western Laurentia (present-day coordinates) at around 1.6 Ga (e.g., Pourteau et al., 2018; Volante et al., 2020); Columbia breakup initiated after 1.35 to 1.3 Ga, with proto-Australian cratons drifting northward from Laurentia (Pisarevsky et al., 2014; Elming et al., 2021; Kirscher et al., 2021); and Rodinia assembly initiated by 1.2 Ga (Spencer et al., 2017). This was followed by the 1.1\u20130.95 Ga final transition from Columbia to Rodinia, that was at least in part accomplished by the \u223c90\u00b0 clockwise rotation of Baltica (\u00b1 Amazonia and West Africa) relative to Laurentia, and their subsequent collision in a new configuration along the Grenville-Sveconorwegian-Putamayo-Sunsas belt (Johansson, 2009; Cawood et al., 2010; Evans, 2013; Martin et al., 2020). The exact timing of the rotation of Baltica with respect to Laurentia is poorly constrained (e.g., Cawood et al., 2010), but paleomagnetic data limit it between 1.12 Ga and 0.99 Ga (Salminen et al., 2009; Swanson-Hysell et al., 2019). Although the use of low quality paleomagnetic data with a loose age criterion (\u00b1 200 Ma) has led to the proposal of a single long-lived supercontinent that lasted from the Archean until the Neoproterozoic (Piper, 2013, 2018), high-quality paleomagnetic data contradicts this model (Li et al., 2009).\nBy comparing coeval pairs of magnetic poles from distinct cratons, the independent or common drift of two or more cratons during a specified time interval can be tested (Buchan et al., 2016). Using great-circle distances and age differences between successive poles, minimum speeds of cratonic motion can be calculated. The calculated rates represent the net sum of motion due to both plate tectonics and true polar wander (TPW; Evans, 2003). During the mid-Proterozoic, only one large-amplitude (>30\u00b0) true polar wander event has been proposed at 1.1 Ga (Mitchell, 2014).\nBy comparing the highest quality coeval paleomagnetic poles, differential motion of the Superior and Slave cratons (Buchan et al., 2016) and Fennoscandia and Sarmatia cratons (Elming et al., 2021) at 1.88\u20131.75 Ga is documented, providing evidence for plate tectonics operating during the amalgamation of Laurentia and Baltica at the onset of Columbia assembly. Using updated reliable paleomagnetic poles, Elming et al. (2021) showed differential motion of the core of Columbia and other cratons such as those of proto-Australia and North China until the final amalgamation of Columbia at 1.6 Ga, as well as after the onset of breakup at 1.35 Ga, with these motions supporting plate tectonics. In addition, the core cratons of Columbia show divergent paleomagnetic poles through Rodinia assembly at 1.1 Ga to 0.9 Ga (Evans, 2021), indicating differential motion of these cratons. Calculated mid-Proterozoic minimum speeds of cratonic motions (Fig. 1b) are typical for present-day continental plates (Zahirovic et al., 2015), contradicting the single-lid hypothesis and the proposed slow speeds of Piper (2013). Variable and fast drift speeds are recorded during the amalgamation of Columbia, whereas during the tenure of Columbia, unimodal drift speeds of 6\u201311 cm yr\u22121 are recorded until 1.3 Ga. Drift speeds both increase and become more variable again during the amalgamation of Rodinia, with data for Laurentia showing rates of 20\u201350 cm yr\u22121 during the main phase of the Grenvillian orogeny at ca. 1.1 Ga, and data for Baltica recording similar speeds during the late stage of the Sveconorwegian orogeny at ca. 0.93 Ga. These obtained speeds exceed the expected limits for plate speeds (Zahirovic et al., 2015) and have been explained by a combination of fast plate motion (Salminen et al., 2009; Swanson-Hysell et al., 2019) and TPW for some periods (Mitchell, 2014). The overall variation in drift speeds during the mid-Proterozoic between separate cratons, comparable drift rates to present day, and faster rates correlating with orogenic activity, strongly supports the plate tectonic hypothesis, and is incompatible with a single-lid mode.\n\n\n3.2\nI-type magmatism and circum-Columbian accretionary belts\nWorldwide 2.0\u20131.6 Ga orogenic events spanning the assembly of the Columbia supercontinent indicate that plate tectonic movements operated during this time period. Whilst collisional orogenesis was occurring in what became the interior of the supercontinent during its assembly phase, subduction-related accretionary orogenesis began or continued along the exterior margins. This process is akin to the formation of the Terra Australia orogen along the margins of Gondwana (Cawood and Buchan, 2007). This temporally and spatially extensive accretionary belt, the Great Proterozoic Accretionary Orogen (Fig. 3) (GPAO; Condie, 2013; Roberts, 2013), produced calc-alkaline I-type magmatism and significant crustal growth along the margins of SE Laurentia, SW Baltica and SW Amazonia (Whitmeyer and Karlstrom, 2007; Roberts and Slagstad, 2015; Johansson, 2009; Johansson et al., 2022). The extent of the GPAO around the entirety of the Columbia supercontinent is not well constrained, but likely included other continents where magmatism of this timeframe is known (e.g., Kalahari, North China Craton, Siberia, India; Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Roberts, 2013; Elming et al., 2021). The poorly constrained paleogeography for many continents in the 1.7\u20131.1 Ga interval also permits the possibility that the GPAO may have been divided into more than one long-lived circum-continental orogen. The GPAO featured magmatism and orogenic activity (Figs. 1a and 2\n), including deformation and metamorphism, forming elongated belts that become progressively younger outboard from the Archean continental nuclei. This pattern is strongly suggestive of semi-continuous subduction and crustal accretion, and hence plate tectonics, occurring along the external margin of Columbia throughout mid-Proterozoic time, but is very difficult to reconcile with a single-lid or stagnant-lid scenario.\n\n\n3.3\nAbsence of blueschists and UHP metamorphism\nBlueschists form during low-temperature (T) and high-pressure (P) metamorphism, which is characteristic of subduction zones. Thus, their occurrence has been used as an indicator of plate tectonics (e.g., Stern, 2005), although there are non-tectonic explanations for their absence from the early Earth geological record (Palin and White, 2016). The oldest non-equivocal well-dated blueschists on Earth formed at ca. 0.77 Ga (Xia et al., 2019), and they only become abundant after 0.5 Ga (Figs. 3\na and 4\na), although it is noteworthy that several other occurrences of low T\/high P metamorphic rocks are found back to 2.1 Ga (e.g., Ganne et al., 2012). The Neoproterozoic is now typically interpreted as recording a transition in subduction style from previously \u2018hot and shallow\u2019 to \u2018cold and steep\u2019 (e.g., Hawkesworth et al., 2016; Palin et al., 2020). The oldest ultra-high pressure (UHP) eclogite on Earth is dated at ca. 620 Ma and is located in the Brasiliano orogenic belt, southwestern Brazil (Ganade de Araujo et al., 2014), although the oldest high-pressure (HP) eclogite is dated at ca. 2.09 Ga and is located in the Eburnean orogenic belt, Cameroon (Loose and Schenk, 2018). Indeed, there is a curious abundance of HP eclogite at ca. 2.1\u20131.8 Ga, followed by a gap of around 800 Myr, coinciding with much of the mid-Proterozoic, before they become pervasive again in the geological record after ca. 0.6 Ga (Fig. 1). These Paleoproterozoic occurrences have been used to argue that modern-style continental collisions requiring plate tectonics occurred at ca. 2 Ga (Weller and St-Onge, 2017). The gap in occurrences between ca. 1.8 and 1.0 Ga has been explained by a transition to a warmer mantle at 2 Ga (Tamblyn et al., 2022). This premise of a warmer mid-Proterozoic mantle, originally hypothesized to have been associated with Earth's first supercontinent (Hoffman, 1989), is in accord with numerical modelling of mantle temperatures during supercontinent formation (e.g., Gurnis, 1988; Coltice et al., 2009); however, this model is still speculative given the unknown length- and time-scales of mantle warming relative to the slowly aggregating Columbia supercontinent.\nThe lack of blueschists and rarity of UHP terranes before the Neoproterozoic is conspicuous, but the meaning of these temporal patterns is equivocal. Using their absence to indicate a lack of plate tectonics didactically infers that plate tectonic processes have not changed through time, which is in stark contrast to other well documented secular changes within the geosphere. For example, the temperature of the mantle impacts the angle and depth of penetration of crustal material subducted into it; it impacts the efficacy of mantle melting, which in turn alters the composition (and buoyancy) of the newly formed oceanic and continental crust; and it impacts the strength of the lithosphere, such that oceanic lithosphere subducted into a hotter mantle on the early Earth would have been less likely to remain coherent, and would have suffered more frequent breakoff (van Hunen and van den Berg, 2008; Sizova et al., 2010, 2014; Fischer and Gerya, 2016). Integrated geodynamic, geochemical, and petrological modelling has shown that: 1) continental crust subducted to UHP depths is unlikely to be exhumed from a hotter mantle (van Hunen and van den Berg, 2008; Sizova et al., 2014); 2) more Mg-rich oceanic crust that would have formed on the Archean Earth from a hotter upper mantle is unable to form archetypal blueschist-facies assemblages, even when metamorphosed to low-T\/high-P conditions (Palin and White, 2016); and 3) secular change in the composition of continental crust through time would have rendered exhumation of subducted, more mafic Precambrian continents more difficult (Palin et al., 2021), promoting a bias towards blueschists or eclogites being formed or exhumed mainly in young orogens.\nGiven that accepted thermal models indicate that the ambient potential mantle temperature was at least 80\u00b0C hotter during the Mesoproterozoic than the present-day temperature (Herzberg et al., 2010; Ganne and Feng, 2017), it is expected that UHP eclogites and blueschists would be notably rarer in the Mesoproterozoic rock record than in the Phanerozoic. We thus consider blueschists and UHP rocks circumstantial indicators of ancient plate tectonics, which do not need to be present in a geological terrane to conclude its operation. They are of most immediate use in confirming the prevalence of cool metamorphic geotherms during the Phanerozoic. Given these lines of reasoning, we consider the evidence equivocal in regard to either hypothesis.\n\n\n3.4\nAbundant high temperature metamorphism\nIn contrast to the \u201corogenic quiescence\u201d postulated by Tang et al. (2021), the Mesoproterozoic was host to numerous tectonothermal events (Fig. 3b). Collisional orogens were abundant during the formation of the Columbia supercontinent (Zhao et al., 2002; Condie et al., 2021). This amalgamation continued until ca. 1.6 Ga, with accretion of Australia to Laurentia at this time (Pourteau et al., 2018). The preserved record of collisional orogenesis was then subdued, although notably still present (Fig. 1c), until the formation of Rodinia from ca. 1.2 to 0.85 Ga (Li et al., 2008). Across the entire Columbia and Rodinia cycles, the metamorphic record is dominated by medium-T to high-T\/low-P thermobaric ratios, when compared to the preceding and subsequent time periods (Fig. 3a), with an apparent maximum in thermobaric ratio in the Mesoproterozoic (Brown and Johnson, 2018). These authors linked the apparent ca. 1.5 Ga peak in thermobaric ratios to mantle insulation under the Columbia supercontinent. Stern (2020) subsequently took this argument as evidence of a single lid existent in the Mesoproterozoic. However, we refer to this peak as apparent for two reasons: first, the metamorphic record in this timeframe is sparse, meaning that small numbers of data points are less likely to be representative for any given period of time, and second because thermal gradients in collisional orogens are continually evolving. Thus, reducing the metamorphic conditions within a terrane to a single P-T point at a certain time is potentially misleading in portraying the complex tectonic processes that operate in both plate tectonic and non-plate tectonic regimes.\nHere, we outline three observations of the metamorphic record at hand, which are evident (Fig. 3): (i) the metamorphic record shows a broad increase to more variable P-T conditions through time; (ii) both the early Proterozoic orogenic periods (2.2\u20131.8 Ga) and late Proterozoic orogenic periods (1.2\u20131.0 Ga) record HT as well as HP metamorphism; and (iii) the Mesoproterozoic is characterized by a lower abundance of collisional orogens compared to bounding eras. The first observation is compatible with an increasing bimodality and variability in metamorphic gradients through time (Fig. 3c), as befits a gradual change in geodynamics resulting from secular cooling of the mantle (Holder et al., 2019). The second observation indicates that a prevalence of high-temperature metamorphism was not restricted to the tenure of supercontinent Columbia, but occurred during both Columbia assembly and its breakup\/transition to Rodinia, as well as during the Phanerozoic and the Neoarchean. This implies that the high thermobaric ratios cannot be solely attributed to mantle insulation from a supercontinent. Regarding the third observation, infrequent orogenesis is recorded during other periods of supercontinent breakup, e.g., at 0.8\u20130.7 Ga, and thus simply reflects the rift-to-drift stage of the continents, prior to collision during the next supercontinent cycle. The low abundance of collisional orogenesis from 1.6 to 1.2 Ga is compatible with the stable tenure and subsequent partial breakup of Columbia before the formation of Rodinia (Roberts, 2013). In the sense of the single-lid model, orogenic events in this timeframe such as the ca. 1.4 Ga Hallandian in Baltica and the Picuris in Laurentia require explanation; it is not clear how events like these would originate in a single lid tectonic regime.\nIn summary, does the metamorphic record of apparently high geothermal gradients, support a single lid hypothesis? We argue that the evidence for mantle heating from a single-lid is equivocal, and the lack of low thermobaric ratios or high-pressure metamorphism through the middle part of mid-Proterozoic (1.6\u20131.2 Ga) can be explained by the lack of collisional orogenies during the tenure and breakup of supercontinent Columbia.\n\n\n3.5\nPaucity of ophiolites and passive margins\nBoth ophiolites and the formation of new passive margins are reliable and independent indicators of plate tectonics. The obduction of oceanic lithosphere onto a continent is evidence for compressional tectonics thought only to accompany subduction. By contrast, passive margins form where space is generated along a continental margin that is not experiencing subduction, and this is generally, if not exclusively, achieved by tectonic subsidence following continental rifting. The geological record suggests that passive margins and ophiolites are both relatively rare during the mid-Proterozoic (Bradley, 2008; Fig. 4). A single-lid regime can feasibly explain the paucity of both of these plate tectonic indicators during the mid-Proterozoic (Stern, 2020). However, the question remains whether \u2018the absence of evidence is evidence of absence\u2019, or in this case, whether the relatively small number of passive margins and ophiolites compared to the Paleoproterozoic and the Neoproterozoic can be explained if plate tectonics was operational.\nContinental reconstructions may be used to assess passive margin initiation and preservation through time, and such treatment suggests that 11 passive margins formed in the Mesoproterozoic (Fig. 4a; Condie, 2021a). The extent to which the Columbia supercontinent broke up will impact the number of passive margins created. At present, most paleogeographic reconstructions only support partial breakup. This, along with long-lived active margins along many continental blocks, is compatible with a low abundance compared to younger periods of Earth history.\nOphiolites are a problematic form of evidence for identifying convergent margin processes through time, as their preservation is more of an exception than the rule. As oceanic lithosphere is preferentially subducted rather than exhumed, their paucity or absence at any point in Earth history is weak and circumstantial evidence of a single-lid environment operating at that time. The abundance of ophiolites partially correlates with that of low-T\/high-P metamorphism (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that formation or preservation of collisional belts has controlled the abundance of ancient ophiolites. Therefore, although the mid-Proterozoic rarity of both ophiolites and passive margins are conspicuous, the records are in accord with: few and large continental landmasses during this time, a protracted and incomplete breakup of the Columbia supercontinent, and continental margins that featured active rather than passive margins. In summary, the evidence is somewhat marginal; we argue that continued formation of passive margins in the Mesoproterozoic supports a plate tectonic hypothesis, whereas the rarity of ophiolites certainly does not negate plate tectonics.\n\n\n3.6\nAbundances of anorthosites and A-type granites\nVoluminous anorthosite intrusive complexes are found throughout the Proterozoic, but are particularly common in the mid-Proterozoic (Ashwal and Bybee, 2017; Fig. 4a); they are commonly associated with A-type granitoids. A-type granitoids are found throughout the geological record since the late Archean (Fig. 4a). There has been a view that A-type granitoids are a feature particular to the mid-Proterozoic (Stern, 2020); however, as pointed out by Condie (2021a), we believe this to be biased by North American sampling, where much work has been conducted on the widespread Mesoproterozoic A-type granite suites. We also point out that it is a misconception that anorthosites and A-type granitoids are restricted to anorogenic settings. Voluminous massif anorthosites are indicative of several specific conditions that allowed their formation, namely, a persistent heat source at the base of the Moho, and a stable geodynamic environment that allows for protracted (\u226510 Myr) melting, polybaric ascent and crystallization. Ashwal and Bybee (2017) suggest that continental arcs provide the most suitable location for these conditions, and highlight the spatial occurrence of many anorthosite intrusions along known convergent plate boundaries. We posit that continental arcs are likely not the sole location, as many large bodies are known from collisional orogens, such as the Grenville Province (Emslie and Hunt, 1990). These examples likely formed from extensive mantle heating during extensional phases of this long-lived hot orogen (Indares, 2020).\nA-type granites were first described from the Lachlan fold belt in SE Australia (Loiselle and Wones, 1979; Collins et al., 1982), where they are known to occur in back-arc settings (Kemp et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2020). Other well studied examples occur in post-collisional settings (Eby, 1990), and notably are now even recognised in the ongoing Himalayan-Tibetan orogen (Hao et al., 2019). Thus, both accretionary and collisional plate boundaries are common settings for A-type granitoids. Taking the well-known and spatially widespread 1.5\u20131.3 Ga A-types as examples (e.g., the Granite-Rhyolite Province of Laurentia), these were long considered to be devoid of convergent margin processes (Anderson and Bender, 1989); however, there is a growing body of work pointing to compressional tectonics across the region that hosts these suites (e.g., Gordon Medaris Jr et al., 2021), meaning they can now be potentially linked to orogenic rather than anorogenic formation. In summary, two lines of evidence do not support the single-lid hypothesis: (i) A-type granites and anorthosites are prevalent before and during amalgamation of the Columbia supercontinent, as well as younger periods in Earth history, indicating that they do not require heat generated from mantle insulation via a supercontinental lid; and (ii) these magma types are not necessarily indicative of anorogenic geodynamics, but are known to commonly form in convergent settings, either within distal back-arcs or regions of post-collisional lithospheric removal where mantle heat flow is elevated. Both lines of evidence are compatible and supporting of the plate tectonics hypothesis, respectively. In contrast, the single-lid hypothesis requires a mechanism of forming these granitoids in a position peripheral rather than central to the Columbia supercontinent.\n\n\n3.7\nMineralization distinction\nMineral deposits show a heterogeneous distribution in time that has been discussed in many previous reviews (see Cawood and Hawkesworth, 2015 and references therein; Fig. 4b). We consider this distribution and its implications to primarily result from the interplay of four factors: (1) the supercontinent cycle imparts a strong preservation bias on mineral deposits based upon their tectonic setting; (2) preservation in the geological record depends on erosion level; (3) formation of different types of mineral deposits is linked to long-term secular trends in Earth-system conditions, such as mantle cooling and seawater composition; and (4) the record is dominated by exceptionally large mineral deposits that likely require special sets of conditions for formation (the Goldilocks effect), and thus are potentially not indicative of widespread global processes at that time. With reference to the mid-Proterozoic, there is a notable absence of orogenic Au, volcanic massive sulphide (VMS) and porphyry Cu, and a notable presence of Ni-Cu-sulphide, Fe-oxide Cu-Ag (IOCG), and uranium and clastic-dominated (CD)-Pb-Zn deposit types (Fig. 2b). Regarding the preservation of tectonic settings, the lack of orogenic Au and porphyry Cu deposits has been related to the deep erosional level of Precambrian rocks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Kesler and Wilkinson, 2008). Richards and Mumin (2013) on the other hand, question the importance of erosional bias for the lack of porphyry systems in the Precambrian. They postulate that porphyry Cu \u00b1 Au and IOCG form in similar subduction-related environments, but that the Phanerozoic vs. Proterozoic prevalence, respectively, is due to higher geothermal gradients and lower seawater sulfate concentrations in the Precambrian oceans. Liu et al. (2019) postulate that the distribution during the Rodinia timeframe indicates a preservation bias whereby non-arc settings are preserved over arc settings in comparison to other supercontinents. Based on mineral occurrence distribution, notably the presence of HFSE enrichments, these authors also speculate the prevalence of lithosphere-asthenosphere interaction during the Mesoproterozoic, and a bias toward intraplate magmatism.\nDoes this unusual mineral deposit distribution support the single-lid hypothesis? Bias in the geological record and the unique nature of some mineral systems inhibits our ability to directly relate the temporal record with geodynamic processes. That being said, a potential link exists between the preserved magmatic and metallogenic record, whereby for the mid-Proterozoic, fore-arc related (I-type) magmas and minerals are apparently low in abundance relative to A-type magmas and mineral systems interpreted as \u2018intraplate\u2019 (Liu et al., 2019). If we accept that plate tectonics was in existence, this preservation would have to be explained by a process that destroyed fore-arc terranes, and preserved back-arc and inboard terranes. CD-Pb-Zn deposits can form in intracratonic rift basins, which is compatible with either single-lid or plate tectonic modes (i.e., as continental back-arcs; Ross and Villeneuve, 2003), but does require a mechanism for tectonic subsidence. Regarding the lack of 1.3\u20130.7 Ga CD-Pb-Zn deposits, this could relate to the style of orogenesis during Rodinia formation (Leach et al., 2010), whereby opposing subduction zones collided, rather than passive margins that can host such mineral deposits. In summary, there is evidence that arc-related ore deposits are low in abundance during the mid-Proterozoic, especially the Mesoproterozoic, which Stern (2020) cites as evidence for a single-lid regime. However, the existence of other deposit types would then also require special circumstances, since these form in post-collisional, intra-cratonic rift or back-arc extensional settings, all of which require a geodynamic driver for extension. Objectively, we therefore find the metallogenic record compatible with the hypothesis of plate tectonics, and in poor support of the single-lid hypothesis.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nSeveral lines of evidence commonly used to argue for and against the operation of plate tectonics at any point in Earth history are equivocal, and are contingent on formational and preservational biases; these are the presence (or absence) of passive margins, ophiolites, blueschists, and UHP metamorphic rocks. Other lines of evidence are still ambiguous, in that some lithologies can form in a variety of geodynamic settings, but in our view, can be used in support of a plate tectonic model; these are the abundances of anorthosites, A-type granites, and various mineral deposit types. Finally, there are lines of evidence that entirely support plate tectonics and are incompatible with a single-lid model; these are: (i) accretionary orogenic belts, associated I-type magmatism and deformation; and (ii) plate motions recorded by paleomagnetic data. The weight of evidence falls in favour of a plate tectonic setting throughout the mid-Proterozoic, and the argument for a single lid is equivocal at best, and is ultimately incompatible with the geological record. We acknowledge that we have omitted discussion on the records of igneous geochemistry and radiogenic isotopes (e.g., Hf and Nd); however, as demonstrated by long-lived and ongoing debate over Archean geodynamics, these are far from trivial (e.g. Johnson et al., 2016; Rollinson, 2022), and, given that the geochemical record resulting from a stagnant-lid regime has no modern analogues and would be difficult to reconstruct, is unlikely to provide any definitive answers.\nAlthough evidence from the geological record falls in favour of plate tectonics since at least the Paleoproterozoic, the record of the mid-Proterozoic, and in particular the early to mid-Mesoproterozoic, is markedly different to the bounding time periods, and as such, demands explanation. Although this time period clearly warrants further detailed investigation, our solution is to advocate changes in lithosphere behaviour that are brought about by elevated mantle temperatures compared to today.\nThree key features of the Mesoproterozoic geological record that require explanation are an abundance of high-temperature magmatism, an abundance of higher thermobaric ratios of metamorphic rocks, and a lack of certified indicators of subduction (ophiolites, blueschists, and UHP metamorphic rocks). We assume the following: (i) between 1.85 and 0.85 Ga, the potential mantle temperature was on average 80\u2013120\u00b0C hotter than today (Fig. 5\na), which leads to distinctly different styles of geodynamics at convergent plate boundaries; and (ii) a global network of plate tectonic boundaries had been initiated before the mid-Proterozoic, possibly as late as ca. 2 Ga (Condie, 2021b), or as early as ca. 3 Ga (Cawood et al., 2018). Following the geodynamic modelling of Sizova and others (e.g., Sizova et al., 2010, 2014; Chowdhury et al., 2020), the mid-Proterozoic is predicted to be a transitional period falling between orogenic styles of the Archean and those that characterise the Phanerozoic (Roberts et al., 2015; Sizova et al., 2010, 2014; Chowdhury et al., 2021; Figs. 5b-5c). Although the scope of this paper is not to postulate any of the much-debated Archean tectonic styles, combined geodynamic and petrological modelling predict that convergent margins in the mid to late Archean would have comprised: episodic slab subduction with rapid breaking and drop-off of the slab, peeling back of the lithosphere exposing the upper plate to hot mantle, and no deep subduction of continental material (e.g., Sizova et al., 2010, 2014; Fischer and Gerya, 2016; Chowdhury et al., 2017, 2020). During the Archean, these \u2018horizontal\u2019 tectonic styles likely became more dominant through time, with \u2018vertical\u2019 tectonic processes not associated with convergent margins, i.e. sagduction, becoming less prevalent. Capitanio et al. (2019) summarise this change from stagnant lid, to \u2018lid and plate\u2019, to plate tectonics reminiscent of modern Earth. In contrast to the mid-Proterozoic and older eons, Phanerozoic mantle temperatures allow for sustained slab subduction of oceanic crust, and deep subduction of continental crust (Sizova et al., 2014; van Hunen and van den Berg, 2008). Condie (2021b) argues that 2.5\u20132.0 and 1.0\u20130.5 Ga are key timeframes bounding this transitional period, marking the onset and establishment of global subduction, and the onset of continental lithospheric subduction, respectively.\n\nSizova et al. (2014) demonstrated that a transitional phase at \u039480\u2013100\u00b0C (i.e., in the mid to late-Proterozoic) would lead to formation of \u2018truncated hot orogens\u2019 and \u2018two-sided hot collisional orogens\u2019. Truncated hot orogens are characterised by no deep continental subduction, shallow slab breakoff, low (or even negative) topography, and abundant melt-bearing mantle between the continental plates. Two-sided collisional orogens have similarities, but with lower degrees of extension due to reduced slab-pull, and melt-bearing mantle underlying the downgoing \u2018lower\u2019 plate. Aspects of these hot orogens are found within the Proterozoic orogenic record, for example, those involved in Rodinia formation such as the ca. 1.1\u20130.9 Ga Grenville and Sveconorwegian orogens (Turlin et al., 2018; Indares, 2020; Bingen et al., 2021). Although continental subduction is precluded in the \u2018hot orogen\u2019 geodynamic models, it is noteworthy that ca. 0.98 Ga continental subduction is recorded in the Sveconorwegian hinterland (M\u00f6ller et al., 2015), implying an overlap between the \u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018transitional\u2019 regimes (Sizova et al., 2014) of collisional orogenesis in the late Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic. Also notable in the geological record is the potentially thin crust in \u2018active\u2019 (i.e., zircon-forming) regions (Tang et al., 2021; Fig. 5a); however, the robustness of the Eu anomaly proxy for crustal thickness applied to the Precambrian is not yet quantified. Thin and weak lithosphere in the mid-Proterozoic is in accord with the metamorphic record of higher thermobaric ratios during orogenesis (Spencer et al., 2021). The geodynamics of ocean-facing convergent margins have a similar fate under increased mantle temperatures to those of continental collision zones (Sizova et al., 2010). Decompression melting in the mantle would have been greater in volume under mid-Proterozoic mantle temperatures, as would the amount of extension in the over-riding plate (Sizova et al., 2010). Therefore, we suggest that the differences in geodynamics between the mid-Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic, although much smaller compared to the differences between the modern and the Mesoarchean, would lead to significant differences in the abundances of magmatic rock associations, mineral systems and metamorphic field gradients.\nAll of the geodynamic changes described above were imposed on a time period when the continents were likely amassed into a single supercontinent or only a few continental fragments. Although it is not exactly known how numerous and dispersed continental fragments were during the Columbia to Rodinia supercontinent transition, Columbia appears to have fragmented only partially, and over a long time period. The fact that the Mesoproterozoic comprised a single or a few \u2018supercontinental plates\u2019, added to the enigmatic nature of this time, lends itself to low abundances in plate tectonic indicators such as passive margin onsets. Thus, the combined effects of secular cooling of the mantle and of the long-lived Columbia supercontinent, can adequately explain the geological record of the mid-Proterozoic within a plate tectonic framework, and do not require alternatives such as single-lid tectonics. During the tenure of the Columbia supercontinent, the world's oceans were most likely divided into several separate oceanic plates with intervening mid-ocean ridges and oceanic island arcs, much like the present-day Pacific Ocean; however, this part of the geological record would have poor preservation potential (Spencer et al., 2017) and has been totally lost.\nPlate tectonics is a geodynamic regime whereby the plates are coupled to convection in the mantle; in single- or stagnant-lid regimes convection is decoupled. Although the mid-Proterozoic, particularly the Mesoproterozoic, likely comprised few continental landmasses in a framework close to a single lid, the record of ongoing continental drift, orogenesis and convergent margin magmatism, implies an ongoing coupling of convection between the mantle and crust \u2013 i.e., plate tectonics was active on Earth since at least 2 Ga, as has also been documented paleomagnetically (Mitchell et al., 2014).\nOur study highlights several areas that require further detailed investigation and modelling, and we pose the following questions: (i) Was continental subduction possible in the Paleoproterozoic, but restricted in the Mesoproterozoic due to sub-continental mantle heating (Tamblyn et al., 2022), or is the metamorphic record biased by preservation rather than formation?; (ii) Is mantle heating from supercontinent insulation a requirement for any of the features of the mid-Proterozoic geological record?; (iii) Does preservation bias, such as a deeper erosion levels, explain the lack of preserved ophiolites and\/or the dearth of some high-level ore deposit types, such as porphyry copper? If not, what controls the formation and preservation of these deposit types through different eons?; (iv) Given that the ratio of fluid-fluxed to decompression melting at convergent margins will change as a result of mantle temperature (Sizova et al., 2010), how does this balance impact the generation and preservation of magmatic and metallogenic suites? We suggest that an improved geodynamic context of the mid-Proterozoic should help better understand the enigmatic relative biologic and climate stasis of the contemporaneous \u2018Boring Billion\u2019 and the links between tectonics and Earth's surface processes.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThe mid-Proterozoic, and the Mesoproterozoic in particular, was neither orogenically quiescent, nor tectonically stagnant; it was merely host to geodynamics that differ from the modern Earth as a result of two processes working in tandem: secular cooling of the mantle and a long-lived supercontinent whose breakup was slow and incomplete. The 1.6\u20131.1 Ga period was dominated by geologic activity occurring along the margins of either a single supercontinental plate (Columbia), or a few plates. We acknowledge that this scenario may give the false impression that the whole Earth consisted of one single plate, and therefore single-lid tectonics might have operated; however, long-lived subduction-related magmatism along the active margin of Columbia, and the plate motions and deformation associated with the transformation from Columbia to Rodinia, collectively attest to the operation of plate tectonics throughout this period, and both lines of evidence are incompatible with single-lid tectonics. Since seafloor spreading and subduction on Earth today are fastest in the oceanic plates of the Pacific Ocean, one should clearly not interpret such long-lived supercontinentality as a single lid. The predicted behaviour of the mid-Proterozoic continental lithosphere with a hotter subcontinental mantle (80\u2013120\u00b0C above present) accord with the geological record, but further work should interrogate how the various peculiarities of the mid-Proterozoic can be placed within this geodynamic framework, and how each facet of the geological record is affected by both formation and preservation biases.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nNick M.W.

Constraining the timing at which the atmosphere-hydrosphere system became significantly oxygenated, reaching near-modern levels, may help to shed new light on the emergence and proliferation of O2-dependent life, including complex life forms such as eukaryotes. Geochemical evidence based on multiple sulfur isotope systematics suggests a first transient rise in atmospheric O2 concentration to above \n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n of the present atmospheric level (PAL) during the initial stages of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at \u223c2.43\u20132.32 Ga (Bekker et al., 2004; Catling and Zahnle, 2020; Farquhar et al., 2000; Hannah et al., 2003; Holland, 2006; Warke et al., 2020). In particular, the disappearance of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes and redox-sensitive detrital minerals (e.g., uraninite, pyrite) from sedimentary records, followed by the appearance of red beds, are some of the most important markers for the GOE (Bekker et al., 2004; Farquhar et al., 2000; Holland, 2006; Lyons et al., 2014). However, the permanent rise of atmospheric O2 likely occurred in the second half of the GOE, during the \u223c2.22\u20132.06 Ga Lomagundi Event (LE) (Poulton et al., 2021). The LE represents the most pronounced and longest-lived positive carbon isotope excursion in Earth history (Bekker, 2022; Karhu and Holland, 1996), and is considered to have resulted in transient highly elevated levels of O2, but to an extent that is currently unclear (Bekker and Holland, 2012). Atmospheric O2 concentrations are estimated to have been at levels below 1% (Colwyn et al., 2019) to as high as \u223c10% PAL (Holland, 2006; Kanzaki and Murakami, 2016) throughout most of the subsequent Proterozoic, up until the \u223c750\u2013539 Ma Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE), when atmospheric O2 is commonly considered to have increased further (Holland, 2006; Lyons et al., 2014; Colwyn et al., 2019).\nThe Paleoproterozoic ocean is widely considered to have been redox-stratified during the GOE (Alcott et al., 2019; Asael et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019; Holland, 2006; Kipp et al., 2017, 2018; Lyons et al., 2014; Poulton et al., 2021; St\u00fceken et al., 2016), with a redoxcline situated above storm wave-base and with O2 concentrations in surface waters that may have been above 0.4 to 1 \u03bcM (Hardisty et al., 2014; Kipp et al., 2017). The post-GOE ocean likely remained redox stratified (Poulton et al., 2010; Poulton and Canfield, 2011; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018; Planavsky et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2008), until episodic oxygenation of the deeper ocean occurred during the NOE (Alcott et al., 2019; Canfield et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2014; von Strandmann et al., 2015).\nMainly based on carbon isotope systematics, the LE is generally considered to reflect a combination of high rates of primary productivity and increased organic carbon burial (Bekker, 2022; Bekker and Holland, 2012; Husson and Peters, 2017; Karhu and Holland, 1996). Elevated organic productivity may have been initiated by a high phosphorus flux to the oceans, potentially due to leaching of terrestrial rocks by sulfuric acid generated through oxidative weathering of pyrite (Bekker and Holland, 2012; Konhauser et al., 2011). The rate of organic matter burial exceeded the rate of its reoxidation, allowing the release of marine photosynthetic O2 which likely caused an atmospheric O2 overshoot (Bekker and Holland, 2012). However, redox and biogeochemical proxies used for constraining O2 concentrations in the atmosphere-ocean system during the LE have yielded contrasting estimates (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018; Colwyn et al., 2019; Hardisty et al., 2014; Holland, 2006; Kanzaki and Murakami, 2016; Kipp et al., 2017; M\u00e4nd et al., 2020). For example, estimates based on the chemical and Cr isotope compositions of Paleoproterozoic paleosols suggest that atmospheric O2 levels remained lower than 1\u201310% PAL (Colwyn et al., 2019; Kanzaki and Murakami, 2016). By contrast, thick (\u223c800 m) evaporite deposits supposedly deposited in marginal-marine environments during the LE, which are interpreted to reflect the oceanic sulfate inventory, as well as associated S, Ca, Sr and O isotope compositions, have been proposed to reflect an oxygenated atmosphere-ocean system with higher than 20% of the modern atmosphere-ocean oxidizing capacity (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018).\nAlthough the mechanism that caused the end of the LE is still debated, its termination, based on C, S, Fe, V, Mo, U and Se biogeochemical proxies in marine sediments, is viewed to be contemporaneous with a drop in O2 levels in the atmosphere-ocean system (Asael et al., 2018; Canfield et al., 2013; Kipp et al., 2017; Kump et al., 2011; Lyons et al., 2014; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a; Planavsky et al., 2012; Scott et al., 2014). However, based on U and Cr isotope compositions and trace-metal (Mo, Cr, U and Re) enrichments in mid-Paleoproterozoic shales from the Zaonega Formation, northwestern Russia, it has been proposed that the atmosphere-ocean system was still well-oxygenated millions of years after the termination of the LE (M\u00e4nd et al., 2020, 2022). Since the biogeochemical cycling of S, Fe, V, Mo and U yield stable oxyanions at circumneutral pH in marine environments at relatively low redox potential (i.e., Eh < 0 V; Rue et al., 1997; Stumm and Morgan, 1970), they are only sensitive as redox indicators at very low levels of environmental O2 (e.g., Andersen et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2022). Furthermore, a wide range of redox and non-redox processes can significantly fractionate Cr isotopes, regardless of the level of O2 available in the environment (e.g., Babechuk et al., 2017, 2018; Miletto et al., 2021). Clearly, further constraints are needed given current uncertainties in estimates of environmental O2 availability. Marine proxies that are redox-sensitive at a higher oxygen threshold (i.e., Eh \u226b 0 V) at circumneutral pH are thus required to shed light on the potential for higher oxygenation levels during the LE.\nTo provide new insight into the evolution of oceanic redox structure during and after the LE and links to environmental oxygenation, we present combined nitrogen and selenium isotope ratios, together with new Fe speciation and organic carbon isotope data, for well-preserved black shales from the mid-Paleoproterozoic Francevillian Group (Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a), which we compare with other LE sedimentary successions. These isotopic systems allow us to track the marine biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and selenium in redox-stratified basins (Ader et al., 2016; Rue et al., 1997; Sigman and Fripiat, 2019; St\u00fceken, 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2016), as well as the behavior of nitrate (NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n) and selenate (SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n), both of which are stable at much higher redox thresholds than SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, MoO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, Fe3+ and U6+ (Rue et al., 1997; Stumm and Morgan, 1970). Both nitrate and selenate are stable at Eh > 0.4 V at circumneutral pH, and only build up to significant levels in open-marine environments if the water column is well oxygenated (Rue et al., 1997). Tracing the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle is complicated, because the nitrogen isotope composition of sedimentary rocks can be influenced by a wide range of both biotic and abiotic processes (Ader et al., 2016; Sigman and Fripiat, 2019; St\u00fceken et al., 2016). However, when paired with the Se biogeochemical cycle, a more rigorous constraint may be achieved, whereby the behavior of NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n and SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n is expected to be internally consistent under oxic, suboxic and anoxic conditions, and this consistency should be recorded in the isotopic signatures. Combined N and Se isotope analyses thus provide a powerful opportunity to unravel the magnitude and extent of ocean oxygenation during and shortly after the LE.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Francevillian Group is an unmetamorphosed \u223c2.1 Ga Paleoproterozoic sedimentary succession, characterized by well-preserved smectite-rich clay minerals in black shales (see Supplementary Information SI 1 for the preservation of Francevillian Group samples studied here), in southeast Gabon (Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2013, 2018), developed within the \u223c44,000 km2 Francevillian basin (Fig. 1\nA). The Francevillian basin is subdivided into four sub-basins including the Boou\u00e9 (Plateau des Abeilles), Lastoursville, Franceville and Okindja (Fig. 1A). The Francevillian Group was deposited during the peak and end of the \u223c2.22\u20132.06 Ga LE (Bros et al., 1992; Horie et al., 2005; Ossa Ossa et al., 2013, 2018, 2021a; Pr\u00e9at et al., 2011) and is subdivided into five formations from the Francevillian A (FA) at the bottom to FE at the top (Fig. 1B; Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003). Our study focuses on carbonaceous, fine-grained sedimentary rocks spanning the FB to FC formations. These units were deposited in open to marginal marine settings (see Supporting Information SI 1 for detailed sedimentological description) during the peak and fall of the LE (Ossa Ossa et al., 2013, 2018; Pr\u00e9at et al., 2011). Besides sedimentological constraints, a high rate of manganese oxidation associated with moderate iron enrichment in an upwelling zone (Canfield et al., 2013; Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018), as well as elevated V\/Al ratios (Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a), provide support that the Francevillian basin was well connected to the open ocean during deposition of the FB and FC formations.\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nMajor elements\nPowdered samples were analysed for major element concentrations by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Analyses were carried out on fusion beads, using a PANalytical MagiX Pro PW2540 spectrometer at the University of Johannesburg. Accuracy was checked with certified reference materials and was better than 1%. Elemental concentrations are reported in wt.% with a detection limit of 0.004 wt.%.\n\n\n3.2\nIron speciation analysis\nIron speciation analyses was performed at the University of Leeds, UK using a calibrated sequential extraction protocol followed by Fe analysis via AAS (Poulton et al., 2021; Poulton and Canfield, 2005). This method is designed to operationally quantify four different pools of Fe considered to be highly-reactive (FeHR) towards sulfide in surface and near-surface environments: (a) pyrite S extracted via Cr-reduction followed by trapping as Ag2S, with Fe calculated assuming an FeS2 stoichiometry (FePy); (b) carbonate-associated iron extracted with a sodium acetate solution (FeCarb); (c) ferric oxides extracted with a dithionite solution (FeOx); and (d) mixed-valence iron oxides, principally magnetite, extracted using ammonium oxalate (FeMag). The total iron content in ancient marine shales (FeT) represents the sum of FeHR and Fe bound in silicates (Poulton et al., 2021; Poulton and Canfield, 2005). Samples were run alongside an international Fe speciation standard (WHIT; Alcott et al., 2020), with replicate analyses giving a RSD of <5% for all Fe pools. For a detailed description of the interpretation of Fe speciation data, see Supplementary Information SI 2.\n\n\n3.3\nCarbon and nitrogen isotope analyses\nThe carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of bulk rock (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCorg and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCbulk, respectively) and the nitrogen isotope composition of the separated kerogen (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker) were determined by elemental analysis\/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA\/IRMS; Flash EA coupled to a Thermo Scientific Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a Conflow III interface) at the Institute of Earth Surface Dynamics, University of Lausanne (IDYST-UNIL). Kerogen, the fraction of organic matter insoluble in organic solvents, was separated from powdered shale samples using non-oxidizing acids (HCl, HF) to dissolve the mineral matrix. For \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN analyses, separate EA combustions were performed using sample aliquots with a 1:50 weight size difference. The isotope ratios are expressed in conventional delta (\u03b4) notation as the per mil (\u2030) of 13C\/12C and 15N\/14N of the sample relative to the standard VPDB for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC and Air-N2 for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN. The measured isotopic ratios were converted to the international scales with a 3- or 4-point calibration using international reference materials (IRMs; USGS-24, USGS-40, USGS-41, IAEA-600 or USGS64, USGS65, and USGS66) and inhouse standards. The accuracy and precision of the analyses were checked periodically through the analysis of standards not included as calibration standards. Separate aliquots of the USGS SGR-1b standard (petroleum and carbonate-rich shale) were decarbonated and analysed for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values. The obtained values (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n=\n\u2212\n29.29\n\u00b1\n0.17\n\u2030\n, V-PDB; \nn\n=\n10\n; \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN\n=\n17.45\n\u00b1\n0.26\n\u2030\n, Air-N2; \nn\n=\n6\n) are in good agreement with the values reported by Dennen et al. (2006) for SGR-1 (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n=\n\u2212\n29.3\n\u00b1\n0.3\n\u2030\n, \nn\n=\n27\n; \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN\n=\n17.4\n\u00b1\n0.9\n\u2030\n, \nn\n=\n18\n). For a detailed description of the analytical procedures, see Supplementary Information SI 2.\n\n\n3.4\nSelenium isotope and elemental analyses\nSample preparation and analysis was carried out at the University of Tuebingen, Germany. Selenium isotope composition was determined by the double-spike method using a ThermoFisher Scientific NeptunePlus multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC\u2013ICP\u2013MS) coupled with an HGX-200 hydride generator (Kurzawa et al., 2017). Data are reported in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\/\n76\n\n\nSe notation, that is, the per mil (\u2030) variation of 82Se\/76Se relative to the NIST SRM 3149 standard. The accuracy and measurement precision were checked by analysing interlaboratory standard MH 495, international rock reference materials and for sulfide analyses in particular by repeated digestion of the Phanerozoic Navaj\u00fan pyrite (K\u00f6nig et al., 2019; Kurzawa et al., 2017). The MH 495 measured during the course of this study yielded a mean \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\/\n76\n\n\nSe value of \n\u2212\n3.24\n\u00b1\n0.05\n\u2030\n (2 SD, \nn\n=\n28\n), which is consistent with previously reported data, while the in-house reference Navaj\u00fan pyrite (K\u00f6nig et al., 2019 and references therein) yielded a mean \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\/\n76\n\n\nSe value of \n\u2212\n2.45\n\u00b1\n0.10\n\u2030\n (2 SD, \nn\n=\n4\n), which is within the external reproducibility as derived from multiple analytical sessions over 16 months, with a mean \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\/\n76\n\n\nSe value of \n\u2212\n2.65\n\u00b1\n0.20\n\u2030\n (2 SD, \nn\n=\n15\n). For a detailed description of the analytical procedures, see Supplementary Information SI 2.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nThe description of the main results (Tables S1, S2) is organized with respect to previous characterization of redox conditions coupled to major upwelling and\/or transgression events during deposition of the FB Formation and FC1 Member (Figs. 1B, 2\n, S2B; Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). For example, published iron speciation data based on highly reactive (FeHR) to total Fe (FeT) ratios indicate that deposition of the lower FB Formation occurred in a well-oxygenated marine environment (FeHR\/FeT < 0.22), which subsequently evolved to a suboxic and even euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic; denoted by FeHR\/FeT > 0.38 and pyrite Fe (FePy) to FeHR ratios > 0.7) water column setting during deposition of the upper part of the FB1c unit (Figs. 2, S2B; Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2013, 2018). Oxic conditions during deposition of most of the FB Formation, with suboxic conditions during deposition of the upper part of the FB1c unit, are further supported by V\/Al ratios averaging 7.7 ppm\/wt.%, Mo\/Al ratios averaging 0.2 ppm\/wt.% and U\/Al ratios averaging 7.7 ppm\/wt.%, which are typical for marine black shale deposited under oxic conditions (Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a). By contrast, higher ratios of V\/Al averaging 46.5 ppm\/wt.%, Mo\/Al averaging 1.6 ppm\/wt.%, and U\/Al averaging 1.2 ppm\/wt.% in the Upper FC1 Member and FD Formation indicate enhanced seawater euxinia during deposition of the upper part of the Francevillian Group (Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a). This is further supported by Fe speciation data, with FeHR\/FeT > 0.38 and FePy\/FeHR > 0.7 in the FD Formation (Canfield et al., 2013; Fig. S2).\nIn the lower part of the FB Formation (Fig. 2; Table S2), black shales of the FB1a unit, which record the main transgressive event in the basin (Canfield et al., 2013; Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2013; Weber, 1968), are characterized by Se concentrations between 2 and 6 \u03bcg\/g, with slightly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values between \u22120.35 and \n\u2212\n0.28\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n0.32\n\u2030\n). The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of bulk samples (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk) and extracted kerogen (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker) show no systematic offset and are positive, with values between +4.4 and +8.1\u2030 (mean value of +6.2\u2030). The total organic carbon (TOC) content of this sedimentary unit is high, between 3.5 and 8.8 wt.%, with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values (expressed in \u2030 relative to VPDB) between \u221225.9 and \n\u2212\n23.7\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n24.6\n\u2030\n).\nFrom the FB1b unit to the middle part of the FB1c units (Fig. 2; Table S2), black shales have Se concentrations of 1 to 7 \u03bcg\/g and predominantly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values between \u22121.49 and +0.26\u2030 (mean value of \n\u2212\n0.64\n\u2030\n). These sedimentary units host early diagenetic pyrite concretions that yield much higher Se concentrations, between 10 and 167 \u03bcg\/g, with predominantly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values between \u22123.0 and \n+\n0.9\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n1.1\n\u2030\n). The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of both bulk samples and extracted kerogen are in the same range, between +1.3 and \n+\n4.9\n\u2030\n (mean values of \n+\n3.4\n\u2030\n, with no systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values), and are much lower than \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values recorded in the underlying FB1a unit (Fig. 2, Table S2). Their TOC contents are highly variable with values between 0.6 and 17.9 wt.%, associated with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values between \u221233.3 and \n\u2212\n21.7\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n27.8\n\u2030\n). The upper part of the FB1c unit corresponds to a major upwelling event and Mn oxide precipitation during a deoxygenation episode (Fig. 2). Black shales of this sedimentary unit deposited in the upwelling zone have Se concentrations between 2 and 3 \u03bcg\/g, but show higher, albeit near-to-zero, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (between \u22120.2 and 0.0\u2030) relative to the underlying units (Fig. 2; Table S2). Their \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values, exclusively above \n+\n5\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n+\n6.2\n\u2030\n, with no systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values), are also much higher than those for the underlying lower FB1c and FB1b units, but are in the same range as those for the transgressive FB1a unit (Fig. 2; Table S2). The upper FB1c unit has TOC contents in the 4 to 6 wt.% range and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values between \u221232.5 and \n\u2212\n31.6\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n32.1\n\u2030\n), which are slightly lower than those for the lower part of the FB1 Member.\nThe FB2 Member, deposited in a predominantly oxygenated seawater column, has been inferred to represent a return to an oxygenated surface ocean following the global deoxygenation event recorded by the underlying Mn-bearing Upper FB1c unit (Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). Black shales of the FB2a unit have Se concentrations between 2 and 3 \u03bcg\/g, with near-to-zero \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values at \n+\n0.2\n\u2030\n, whereas \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN shifts to near-zero values between \u22120.7 and \n+\n1.4\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n+\n0.8\n\u2030\n, with no systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values), relative to the significantly higher values (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN\n>\n+\n5\n\u2030\n) recorded in the underlying Upper FB1c unit deposited during a deoxygenation event (Fig. 2; Table S2). The TOC content is between 0.7 and 4.8 wt.%, with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values between \u221234.7 and \n\u2212\n31.5\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n33.1\n\u2030\n). In the FB2b unit, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values are negative, between \u22120.5 and \n\u2212\n0.4\n\u2030\n in the black shales, with Se concentrations of 1\u20132 \u03bcg\/g (Fig. 2; Table S2). Early diagenetic pyrite concretions hosted in these FB2b unit black shales yield higher Se concentrations, between 11 and 66 \u03bcg\/g, with lighter \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values between \u22121.1 and \n\u2212\n0.2\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n0.8\n\u2030\n) (Fig. 2; Table S2). The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values are predominantly close to zero and range between \u22121.2 and \n+\n4.8\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n+\n0.4\n\u2030\n, with no systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values). The TOC and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values in the FB2b unit are similar to those from the underlying FB2a unit.\nThe last black shale unit analyzed in this study occurs in the Upper FC1 Member, which corresponds to the end of the LE associated with a deoxygenation event (Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a). Here, Se concentrations in black shales are between 4 and 7 \u03bcg\/g, and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values are between \u22120.2 and 0.0\u2030 (mean value of \n\u2212\n0.1\n\u2030\n), whereas early diagenetic pyrite concretions hosted in these black shales yield Se concentrations of 68\u201370 \u03bcg\/g and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values between \u22120.6 and \n\u2212\n0.2\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n\u2212\n0.4\n\u2030\n) (Fig. 2; Table S2). \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values shift again to exclusively positive values > \n+\n5\n\u2030\n (mean value of \n+\n6.1\n\u2030\n, with no systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values) relative to the near-zero values recorded in the underlying FB2 Member. The TOC content is between 2.0 and 18.3 wt.%, with more negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values (\u221248.9 to \n\u2212\n37.1\n\u2030\n, mean value of \n\u2212\n42.8\n\u2030\n). Furthermore, new iron speciation data from this sedimentary unit have FeHR\/FeT ratios > 0.38 (mean value of 0.93), while FePy\/FeHR ranges between 0.21 and 0.88 (mean value of 0.57) (Fig. 2; Table S1).\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nAs for any ancient sedimentary rock evaluated for biogeochemical signatures and redox proxies, diagenetic and secondary alteration processes need to be carefully considered. The excellent preservation of the FB shales has already been indicated (Ossa Ossa et al., 2013) and further discussion can be found in the Supplementary Information (SI 1; Fig. S3). We further infer that post-depositional alteration processes had only a minimal effect on N isotope data presented in this study (see SI 3), as demonstrated by a lack of a systematic offset between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNbulk and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nNker values (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the well-preserved pyrite concretions analyzed in this study rule out post-depositional alteration and\/or surface oxidative weathering (Fig. S3). In addition, a significant effect on the Se isotope ratios of pyrite with such high Se concentrations seems unlikely, given the large amount of Se that would have had to be mobilized. Specifically for Se, the reducing conditions maintained by TOC and sulfide would have provided a strong O2-buffer, which would not allow much (if any) soluble, oxidized Se phases to be mobilized. In view of this, the excellent preservation, combined with reducing conditions, indicate that Se and N biogeochemical signatures are well preserved and thus robust.\n\n5.1\nRedox conditions in the Francevillian water column\nThe average Se concentration of the Francevillian black shales (1 to 7 \u03bcg\/g) shows authigenic enrichment, with high Se\/Al ratios between 0.04 and 1.43 ppm\/wt.%, which are considerably higher than the average UCC value of 0.01 ppm\/wt.% (cf. Rudnick and Gao, 2014). While Se appears to be mainly associated with sulfide phases in the Francevillian Group black shales (see Fig. S4), this enrichment is within the range of other Paleoproterozoic and late Neoarchean sedimentary successions, and is interpreted to result from oxidative terrestrial weathering of selenium-bearing minerals, followed by Se sequestration into organic- and sulfide-bearing sediments (Kipp et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2016; St\u00fceken, 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2015; von Strandmann et al., 2015).\nThe modern Se geochemical cycle is dominated by aerobic processes, with an average \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe value of approximately \n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n in seawater (Fig. S5A; Cutter and Bruland, 1984; St\u00fceken, 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2015; von Strandmann et al., 2015). Terrestrial runoff represents the dominant Se input to the oceans (\u223c89% of Se), with an average \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe value within the igneous inventory range of between \u22120.3 to \n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n, while \u223c10% is contributed by volcanic activity and\/or aerosols (St\u00fceken, 2017). Incorporation into organic particles (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\n\nSe\n\n\u2248\n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n) and sulfide minerals (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\n\nSe\n\n\u2264\n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n) in suboxic and anoxic\/euxinic areas (\u223c45 and 7% of Se, respectively), as well as adsorption onto ferromanganese oxides (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\n\nSe\n\n\u2248\n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n) in oxic seawater (\u223c48% of Se), represent the main oceanic Se output channels (St\u00fceken, 2017). In the modern, fully oxygenated ocean, negative sedimentary \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values reflect partial reduction of SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n (i.e., SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n and HSeO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n) during diagenesis, although a similar signal may also be generated in oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ) settings overlain by oxygenated waters (Fig. 2B). Oxic water masses are enriched in dissolved Se and continuously supply Se oxyanions, which prevents quantitative Se reduction in anoxic pore-waters or in OMZ settings (Fig. S5A; Kipp et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2016; St\u00fceken, 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2015; von Strandmann et al., 2015). In a strongly redox-stratified water column, sediments record positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values, similar to, or exceeding those, of local seawater, due to near-quantitative reduction where the rate of SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n supply lags behind its removal (Fig. S5A; Kipp et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2016; St\u00fceken, 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2015; von Strandmann et al., 2015).\nIn the FB Formation black shales deposited during the LE, negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values are dominant from inner to upper outer shelf depositional environments (maximum water depth around 100 m) and suggest non-quantitative reduction of SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n in oxic to suboxic bottom waters and\/or in sediments at the site of deposition (Fig. 2; Table S2). Predominantly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values in the upper outer shelf are consistent with SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n resupply from oxygenated lower outer shelf or much deeper water masses, as proposed for the NOE and Phanerozoic oceans (von Strandmann et al., 2015). Consequently, the seawater column in the Francevillian basin must have been fully oxygenated during the LE, including nearshore and offshore environments, with a sufficiently deep redoxcline (>100 to \u223c200 m deep; see SI.1) to allow for the build-up of a large SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n reservoir in the surface ocean.\nTo distinguish between water-column and sedimentary SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n reduction, we investigated selenium isotope compositions in early diagenetic pyrite concretions characterized by negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS (averaging \n\u2212\n20\n\u2030\n) and near-to-zero \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, which are considered to have formed in equilibrium with sediment pore-waters (Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). Here, pyrite has Se concentrations higher than the host sediments (having values as high as 167 \u03bcg\/g), with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (down to \n\u2212\n3\n\u2030\n) in both shallow- and deep-marine environments (Fig. 2; Table S2). The highly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values of the FB Formation pyrite are similar to those of Jurassic, Cretaceous and modern diagenetic pyrite concretions from sediments deposited beneath an oxygenated seawater column (Table S3). Therefore, combined S-Se isotope systematics for early diagenetic FB Formation pyrite concretions show that at high partial sulfate reduction rates in the sediments, the reduction of SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n (likely a selenate; SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n) was not complete (K\u00f6nig et al., 2019). Furthermore, Mn oxides, which were present as electron acceptors in Francevillian Group sediments (Canfield et al., 2013; Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021b) require a redox potential higher than, or similar to, SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n at circumneutral pH in marine environments (Figs. S6, S7). Therefore, SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n species are also expected to have been available as electron acceptors during early diagenesis (Canfield et al., 2013; Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021b). Incomplete diagenetic SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n reduction thus further supports a continuous supply of SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n, a fully oxygenated water column in the open-marine Francevillian basin, and a redoxcline likely situated much deeper in the water column, below the outer shelf, during the LE (Figs. 2; SI.1).\nNevertheless, three intervals spanning inner- and outer-shelf environments record small positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values in black shales, with one of these intervals having a diagenetic pyrite concretion with higher positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (Fig. 2; Table S2). These positive values may have resulted from near-quantitative Se reduction under anoxic seawater conditions, but this interpretation is incompatible with highly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values, low FeHR\/FeT, V\/Al, Mo\/Al and U\/Al ratios for the black shales, which suggest oxic bottom waters at the site of deposition during a period of high marine sulfate concentration (Fig. 2; Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a, 2021b). We thus interpret the positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe value of \n+\n0.9\n\u2030\n for this early diagenetic pyrite concretion to reflect complete Se reduction in the sediments, as proposed for the Cretaceous Navaj\u00fan pyrite (K\u00f6nig et al., 2019), while the host shale \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values of +0.2 to \n+\n0.3\n\u2030\n represent biomass accumulation, potentially recording seawater Se isotope composition (St\u00fceken, 2017; von Strandmann et al., 2015). Such conditions may have been due to a higher rate of organic carbon sequestration causing extensive anoxia during early diagenesis, thus likely exhausting the availability of electron acceptors, and\/or Se assimilation into biomass, perhaps due to an overall lower seawater SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n reservoir during deposition. In the latter case, SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n might have been more sensitive to mild redox changes under moderately suboxic conditions in the Francevillian basin seawaters than redox proxies based on Fe and S.\nFor the upper part of the FC Formation black shales, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe data show near-to-zero to slightly negative values, which may be interpreted in different ways (St\u00fceken, 2017). However, our new Fe speciation data indicate deposition under euxinic to anoxic, ferruginous conditions (Figs. 2, S2B; Table S1). Furthermore, previously published \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe data from a much higher resolution sample set from this sedimentary succession show predominantly positive to near-to-zero values and minor negative values (Fig. 2; Kipp et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2016), which is consistent with an euxinic to anoxic\/suboxic setting. Indeed, a strongly redox-stratified marine setting, with a shallow redoxcline, has been proposed for the upper part of the FC Formation (Kipp et al., 2017; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a). Collectively, trace elements (V, U, Mo), Fe speciation and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe data for the upper part of the FC Formation support deposition under anoxic seawater conditions, following upwelling of Fe2+- and Mn2+-rich anoxic waters during a period of enhanced submarine volcanic activity at the end of the LE (Fig. 2; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a).\n\n\n5.2\nBiogeochemical nitrogen cycle during the LE\nModern oceans are characterized by an aerobic N cycle, where nitrate (NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n) is the major dissolved species and carries a positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN signature (averaging \n\u223c\n+\n5\n\u2030\n with respect to present-day atmospheric N2, which, by definition, has a \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN value of 0\u2030; Ader et al., 2016; Sigman and Fripiat, 2019). This isotopic enrichment is mainly controlled by partial loss of nitrate through water-column denitrification and\/or anammox in OMZs (Ader et al., 2016; Sigman and Fripiat, 2019; St\u00fceken et al., 2016). Nitrate-assimilating biomass indirectly preserves the isotopic composition of dissolved nitrate in marine sediments (Fig. S5B). By contrast, under anoxic conditions, where nitrate is typically absent from the water column, the N isotope composition of biomass is controlled by biological N2 fixation, with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values in the range of \u22123 to \n+\n1\n\u2030\n (Ader et al., 2016; Sigman and Fripiat, 2019; St\u00fceken et al., 2016), with only rare examples down to \u223c \n\u2212\n7\n\u2030\n (Zhang et al., 2014). Interpretations of N isotope data from ancient sedimentary rocks have been challenged on the basis that the N isotopic composition of the atmosphere may have changed over time (e.g., Jia and Kerrich, 2004; Kerrich et al., 2006). However, N isotope analyses of fluid inclusions in cherts have shown that the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN value of atmospheric N2 has likely stayed close to 0\u2030 since at least ca. 3.5 Ga (Sano and Pillinger, 1990; Marty et al., 2013). Therefore, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values > \n+\n2\n\u2030\n in ancient unaltered marine sedimentary rocks are generally interpreted to reflect the operation of an aerobic N cycle (e.g., Fig. S5B; Ader et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2019; Kipp et al., 2018; St\u00fceken et al., 2016; Zerkle et al., 2017).\nThe Francevillian Group black shales are dominated by \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values in the range of \u22122 to \n+\n3\n\u2030\n (average \n+\n1\n\u00b1\n3\n\u2030\n), with positive shifts of > 5\u2030 (having no relationship to water depth) at three stratigraphic levels (Fig. 2; Table S2). The assumed low degree of post-depositional alteration of the N isotope data suggests that the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values obtained for the studied FB and FC formations OM-rich shale and silty shale samples should provide a best estimate of the primary isotopic composition of middle Paleoproterozoic sediments and organic matter (see SI 3; Figs. 2, S8). Combined Fe speciation, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and trace metal concentration data indicate deposition under a well-oxygenated water column. By contrast, a few samples with elevated FeHR\/FeT (> 0.38) ratios from the FB2b unit, as well as the predominantly small \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of \n+\n1\n\u00b1\n3\n\u2030\n in the FB Formation (Fig. 2; Table S2), could be interpreted to reflect deposition under anoxic water-column conditions with a purely anaerobic N cycle. However, these elevated FeHR\/FeT ratios and low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values contrast with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values, low V\/Al, low Mo\/Al, and low U\/Al ratios that are suggestive of oxic water column conditions (Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a; Fig. 2). We propose that the elevated FeHR\/FeT ratios more likely represent upwelling of deep anoxic waters onto oxic shallow shelves (potentially changing the chemocline depth), causing precipitation of iron from the water column. Hence, considering this generally oxic setting, it is unlikely that these low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values reflect a purely anaerobic N cycle. Instead, we interpret the N isotope data to reflect quantitative nitrification in an oxic seawater column, while denitrification mainly occurred in sediments, which typically results in very small isotopic effects (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of \n+\n1\n\u00b1\n3\n\u2030\n).\nThis interpretation further suggests that the redoxcline (at which water-column denitrification occurs and imparts large fractionations in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN) was generally situated much deeper on the outer shelf (maximum water depth < 200 m; SI 1), or even below it, and that the Francevillian basin was not connected to a larger, isotopically fractionated marine NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n reservoir during deposition of the FB and FC formations. One possible explanation might be that the basin was restricted at this time. However, this seems unlikely because the FB and FC formations record the LE, which was a typical feature of the open ocean (Bekker, 2022; Bekker et al., 2003; Karhu and Holland, 1996). Furthermore, trace metal enrichments (V, Mo and U) in the upper part of the FC Formation (Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a) indicate that the Francevillian basin was likely connected to the global ocean. Rather, we suggest that the open ocean did not contain a significant NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n pool that could have mixed with, and isotopically influenced, the nitrogen cycle in shallow-water settings. If the offshore marine NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n pool was indeed small, biological N2 fixation rather than NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n assimilation would have been the major N uptake process, similar to some Mesoarchean and Mesoproterozoic marine settings or the modern Black Sea, and this may have contributed to dissolved N (likely ammonium) with low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values in the biological N2 fixation range (Ader et al., 2016; Ossa Ossa et al., 2019; St\u00fceken et al., 2016). Mixing of this negligible ammonium reservoir (with low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values) with the shallow-marine, isotopically unfractionated nitrate reservoir would explain the relatively low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values observed in the shallow-marine sediments.\nPositive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values, between +5 and \n+\n8\n\u2030\n, recorded during the three episodes of redoxcline encroachment into shallow-marine environments indicate that, during these intervals, NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n concentrations were high enough to allow only partial water-column denitrification. The residual isotopically enriched NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n pool was evidently large enough to be assimilated into biomass followed by subsequent preservation in the sediments (Figs. 2, 3\n). This is further supported by previously published N isotope data for the upper part of the FC Formation (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN\n>\n+\n5\n\u2030\n), indicating partial water-column denitrification and\/or anammox, with a NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n pool that was large enough to leave an isotopic signature of strong redox cycling of nitrogen in the water column (Kipp et al., 2018).\nImportantly, deposition of the upper parts of the FB1c unit and FC Formation coincided with a global two-step deoxygenation event during a period of enhanced submarine volcanic activity at the end of the LE (Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). Associated with these phenomena, an episodic redoxcline encroachment onto the inner shelf would have locally provided anoxic conditions for partial denitrification and\/or anammox in the water-column, which is supported by highly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nCTOC values (down to \n\u2212\n48\n\u2030\n, V-PDB), reflecting enhanced activity of heterotrophs (e.g., methanotrophs and denitrifiers) in the water column during these two deoxygenation events (Figs. 2, 3; Table S2; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018). Before these events, the NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n reservoir progressively grew as a result of enhanced oxygenic photosynthesis during the LE, which resulted in an expansion of oxygenated conditions in the Francevillian basin from the shelf edge to outer shelf. This scenario implies availability of free O2, at least at the level of a few \u03bcM, to allow buildup of NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n above the redoxcline. Nitrate reduction becomes pervasive when dissolved oxygen is below \u223c2 \u03bcM (Lam and Kuypers, 2011), which is equivalent to roughly 1% of modern seawater dissolved oxygen in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Hence, seawater dissolved oxygen at the depositional site of the upper parts of the FB1C unit and FC Formation appears to have been above this threshold. Our combined N and Se isotope data thus provide a minimum level of 1% modern marine O2 saturation level for the dissolved oxygen content of seawater at the end of the LE.\nAnother sedimentary succession, the lower ca. 2.1\u20132.0 Ga Zaonega Formation of Russia (see Ossa Ossa et al., 2018, 2021a for detailed discussion on the depositional age), where Fe speciation and trace-metal data suggest deposition under oxic conditions during the late stage of the LE (Canfield et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2014), also shows a correlation between extracted kerogen \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values < \n+\n2\n\u2030\n (Kump et al., 2011) and light \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (Fig. 4\n; Table S3). By contrast, the upper part of the Zaonega Formation, which was deposited during the deoxygenation event at the end of the LE (Asael et al., 2018; Canfield et al., 2013; Kump et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2014), yielded more positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of > \n+\n2\n\u2030\n for extracted kerogen (Kump et al., 2011) and more positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (Fig. 4; Table S3). Combined, the Francevillian Group and the lower Zaonega Formation N and Se isotope data show parallel trends associated with similar seawater redox changes. Continental-shelf black shales with near-to-zero \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values of extracted kerogen are also known from several other sedimentary successions recording the LE, including the ca. 2.2 Ga Wewe Slate, ca. 2.15 Ga Sengoma Argillite Formation, and ca. 2.1 Ga Hautes Chute Formation (Kipp et al., 2018). Collectively, this indicates that oxic conditions with small seawater NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n- and SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n-reservoirs, episodically affected by an encroaching redoxcline, were a common feature in marginal-marine basins across the LE until its end. Hence, enhanced biological O2 production drove pervasive oxygenation in shelf environments, which likely shifted the redoxcline deeper in the water column to allow growth of the O2, NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n and SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n pools in open, marginal-marine settings during the LE (Fig. 3).\n\n\n5.3\nImplications for Earth surface oxygenation during the LE\nBased on the molybdenum isotope records of black shales deposited during the GOE, it has been inferred that the oceans were redox-stratified and largely anoxic, but with pulsed intervals of progressively expanding euxinia from the early stage of the GOE (ca. 2.43 Ga) to its termination (ca. 2.06 Ga) (Asael et al., 2018). This view is also supported by previously published Se isotope data for contemporaneous continental-shelf black shales, which are dominated by positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values (Fig. 5\n; Kipp et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2016; St\u00fceken et al., 2015), inferred to reflect quantitative SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n reduction in strongly redox-stratified oceans with a shallow redoxcline situated above storm wave-base (Fig. 5; Kipp et al., 2017). The predominantly positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values (> \n+\n4\n\u2030\n) in these black shales deposited during the early stage of the GOE\u2014before the LE\u2014 are also consistent with partial water-column denitrification and anammox in strongly redox-stratified oceans with a significant nitrate reservoir in the oxic surface layer (Cheng et al., 2019; Kipp et al., 2018; St\u00fceken et al., 2016), similar to that inferred for the two-step deoxygenation event at the end of the LE recorded in the Francevillian basin (Figs. 2, 3; Table S2). It thus appears that positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values recorded in marginal-marine settings at the beginning and end of the GOE\u2014before and immediately after the LE\u2014reflect a locally enhanced isotopic expression of partial water-column denitrification and\/or anammox, as a consequence of redox stratification. A minimum O2 surface ocean concentration of >0.4 \u03bcM has been proposed during these two time intervals, based on Se isotope data alone (Kipp et al., 2017). Our combined N and Se isotope data increase the minimal seawater dissolved O2 concentration to >2 \u03bcM for the later timer interval.\nMolybdenum isotope data show that during the LE, the ocean redox state evolved towards the more expansive development of oxic conditions, before returning at the end of the LE to oceans with a shallow redoxcline and extensive development of euxinic conditions (Asael et al., 2018). High I\/(Ca+Mg) ratios in shallow-water carbonates, which are interpreted to reflect a substantial IO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n reservoir in the surface ocean, with dissolved O2 concentrations of at least 1 \u03bcM, agree with more expansive seawater oxygenation during the LE (Hardisty et al., 2014), although offshore environments\u2014outer shelf and beyond\u2014are inferred to have remained anoxic (Kipp et al., 2017; St\u00fceken et al., 2016). Our data show a small range in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n15\n\n\nN values (\n+\n1\n\u00b1\n3\n\u2030\n), combined with predominantly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n82\n\n\nSe values, for sediments deposited below storm wave-base, suggesting extensive oxygenation of the lower outer shelf during the LE (Figs. 2, 3). Dissolved NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n with a maximum concentration of \u223c4 \u03bcM (Cheng et al., 2019) has been suggested for proximal-shelf marine environments during the early stage of the GOE (Cheng et al., 2019; Kipp et al., 2018; St\u00fceken et al., 2016), and such conditions might have developed, at least episodically, as early as the Neoarchean (cf. St\u00fceken et al., 2016 and references therein). However, this NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n pool did not reach a pervasive and stable level in offshore environments situated on the lower part of the outer shelf during the Paleoproterozoic (Cheng et al., 2019; Kipp et al., 2018; St\u00fceken et al., 2016). Our combined N and Se isotope data show for the first time that the NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n and SeO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n reservoirs were persistent and stable across the entire continental shelf during the LE (Fig. 3). This requires a much higher rate of oxidant accumulation, with O2 and NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n concentrations well above the minimum levels reached during the early stage and end of the GOE, which indicates enhanced biological O2 production in the surface ocean. Such a high rate of oxygenic photosynthesis in shallow-marine environments must have caused O2 downwelling, resulting in a deeper position of the redoxcline in the water column (Fig. 5), which nevertheless likely remained shallower than in the NOE oceans (Alcott et al., 2019; Canfield et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2014; von Strandmann et al., 2015).\nThick sulfate evaporite deposits, consistent with high seawater sulfate concentrations and developed in a supposedly marginal-marine basin during the LE, have been linked to the buildup of an oxidant reservoir equivalent to more than 20% of the modern atmosphere-ocean oxidizing capacity (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018). However, an open-marine setting for this succession in the Onega basin on the Karelia craton has been recently questioned on sedimentological and geochemical grounds (Alfimova et al., 2022), and an apparently large thickness of the sulfate evaporite deposit might reflect a drill core intersection through the central part of a salt diapir rather than true stratigraphic thickness (cf. Esipko et al., 2014). Furthermore, based on large U and Cr isotope fractionations recorded in black shales deposited at the end of the LE, it has been proposed that the middle Paleoproterozoic oceans remained well-oxygenated even after the end of the LE, and that modern-style biogeochemical cycling developed during the middle Paleoproterozoic (M\u00e4nd et al., 2020, 2022). However, the Cr and U isotope data can be explained by slow depositional rates and the removal of redox-sensitive elements from the oceans under suboxic to weakly euxinic settings after the GOE. Furthermore, large Cr and U isotope fractionations, which have not been systematically recognized in sedimentary deposits until the Neoproterozoic (e.g., Dang et al., 2022; Planavsky et al., 2014), may alternatively suggest that these redox-sensitive elements were drawn from a relatively small seawater reservoir, either in the whole ocean or in somewhat isolated basins (see Andersen et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2022). Considering the regional stratigraphic framework for Karelia in Finland and Russia, where multiple sedimentary basins record flooding at the end of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion, as also recorded by the Zaonega Formation, it appears that these large U and Cr isotope variations over short stratigraphic intervals likely reflect a very small U and Cr reservoir in the ocean. It is also important to emphasize that multistage reduction-oxidation processes subsequent to deposition and in association with hydrothermal fluid or hydrocarbon migration, as well as a wide range of redox-independent processes, could fractionate Cr and U isotopes regardless of ocean dissolved oxygen content (Andersen et al., 2020; Babechuk et al., 2017, 2018; Dang et al., 2022; Miletto et al., 2021), which limits their application to infer O2 levels in the atmosphere-ocean system.\nRegardless of this difference in interpretation, in contrast to N and Se, S and U yield oxyanions that are stable at low Eh (< 0 V; Figs. S6, S7; Rue et al., 1997; Stumm and Morgan, 1970) under the circumneutral pH conditions of the Paleoproterozoic oceans (Halevy and Bachan, 2017). Although our combined N and Se isotope data support extensive ocean oxygenation during the LE, it appears that the NO\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n inventory was not sufficient to shift the N isotopic composition of the global ocean. A model arguing for biogeochemical cycling comparable with the oxidant reservoir approaching the size of the modern atmosphere-ocean capacity (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018; M\u00e4nd et al., 2020) thus seems unlikely for the middle Paleoproterozoic. Moreover, the N and Se isotope data indicate that the oxyanions of these two elements, which are redox-sensitive at a higher redox potential (Eh > 0.4 V at circumneutral pH; Figs. S6, S7, S1), were more attuned to O2 dynamics in the atmosphere-ocean system across the GOE, compared to S- and U-based proxies. Indeed, N and Se isotope data record progressive oxygenation of the atmosphere-ocean system from the beginning of the GOE to the LE, which is not clearly expressed in S and U isotope data (e.g., Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2018; Holland, 2006; M\u00e4nd et al., 2020; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018; Planavsky et al., 2012; Scott et al., 2014). Furthermore, N and Se isotope data also record widespread ocean deoxygenation at the end of the LE\/GOE that is not obvious in U and Mo isotope records (M\u00e4nd et al., 2020; but see Asael et al., 2018 and Andersen et al., 2020 for a different view on secular Mo and U isotope variations). Development of deoxygenated marine conditions at the end of the LE is further supported by high V enrichment in black shales (Asael et al., 2018; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2014), which reflects strong anoxia in open, continental-shelf settings (Canfield et al., 2013; Ossa Ossa et al., 2021a). Anoxic seawater conditions at the end of the LE does not imply that these oceanic conditions remained steady until the NOE, and indeed, several local to potentially global mid-Proterozoic oxygenation events have recently been described (Canfield et al., 2018; Dang et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021; St\u00fceken et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018). The evolving picture of oxygen dynamics in the Paleoproterozoic atmosphere-ocean system thus highlights an increase in the amplitude of oxygenation from the beginning of the GOE to the LE, with superimposed smaller scale oxygen oscillations. This implies that, despite transiently elevated oxygen concentrations during the LE, feedbacks linking terrestrial weathering, nutrient controls on primary organic productivity, and low oxygen levels maintained the atmosphere-ocean system at an oxygenation state far below the modern level.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nDissolved nitrate was heterogeneous and unstable in offshore marine environments during the ca. 2.43\u20132.06 Ga GOE. By contrast, new combined Se and N isotope data presented here show that continental shelf waters were highly oxygenated, with unlimited supply of nitrate and selenium oxyanions during the peak of the LE. Although enhanced accumulation of oxidants clearly demonstrates high rates of oxygenic photosynthesis in shallow-marine environments during the LE, the oceanic O2 inventory remained well below the modern level. Pervasive redox stratification in the deep oceans during the LE implies that the global extent of modern biogeochemical cycles and their isotopic effects were not achieved until the end of the Neoproterozoic.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nConception and design of the study: Frantz Ossa Ossa and Ronny Schoenberg; Field sampling: Frantz Ossa Ossa, Axel Hofmann, Andrey Bekker and Ronny Schoenberg; Acquisition of data: Frantz Ossa Ossa, Jorge E.

Under oxygen-deficient conditions and with oxidative continental weathering largely lacking, the Archaean geochemical cycle of S was very different from that of today. The Archaean oceans were sulfate-poor and atmospherically sourced S dominated their S budget (Canfield et al., 2000; Crowe et al., 2014; Ueno, 2014). As a consequence of low sulfate concentrations, Archaean marine sediments typically record a narrow range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values (approximately \u22125\u2013+5 \u2030; Bekker et al., 2009; Canfield, 2005; Habicht et al., 2002). In addition, the Archaean sedimentary record is characterised by anomalous S isotope composition of sulfide and sulfate minerals with mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes (MIF-S), a phenomenon derived from the interaction of UV solar radiation with SO2 gas in an oxygen-poor atmosphere (Farquhar et al., 2001; Pavlov and Kasting, 2002).\nLaboratory experiments have revealed that irradiation of gaseous S species (mostly SO2) with UV light induces photochemical reactions that result in the production of oxidised species (SO3, SO\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n) with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values and elemental S with positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values (Farquhar et al., 2001). The specific S-isotope fractionation trends in these reactions are strongly dependent on the wavelength of the incident light and the gas composition and pressure used during the experiments (Endo et al., 2016; Farquhar et al., 2001; Whitehill et al., 2015). Thus, specific, broad \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS relationships observed in the sedimentary rock record spanning from the Eoarchaean to the Neoarchaean, called Archaean reference arrays (ARA), are thought to be a fingerprint of the photochemical pathways of isotopic fractionation and to broadly reflect contemporaneous atmospheric composition (Halevy, 2013; Farquhar et al., 2001, 2007; Masterson et al., 2011; Ono et al., 2013; Zerkle et al., 2012). For example, deviations from the ARA in the Neoarchaean sedimentary records on the Kaapvaal craton have been linked to high atmospheric CH4 levels and CH4\/CO2 ratios (Zerkle et al., 2012). The Mesoarchaean S record, in contrast, is characterised by limited \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS range in comparison to both the Palaeo- and Neoarchaean records, a feature that has been ascribed either to partial shutdown of mass-independent S isotope fractionation processes due to a transient atmospheric oxygenation (Ohmoto et al., 2006) or to a different atmospheric composition (Farquhar et al., 2007).\nImportantly, photochemical experiments so far have not succeeded in reproducing the ARA and yielded much lower \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios (<1 and <\u22121, respectively). Instead, the experimental results appear to match well the MIF-S trends observed in modern volcanic sulfates preserved in Antarctic ice, which are interpreted to have been influenced by photolysis and photoexcitation reactions during large stratospheric volcanic eruptions (Baroni et al., 2007, 2008; Savarino et al., 2003). This mismatch has not been fully resolved so far, and represents one of the outstanding issues in the understanding of the S-cycle on the Archaean Earth.\nIn this study, we use quadruple S isotope ratios of sedimentary to diagenetic pyrite to characterise S fluxes to intracontinental lakes in a volcanically active Mesoarchaean environment. While the present understanding of the Archaean S cycle is largely based on marine sedimentary rocks, only a few studies so far have explored the S cycle in Archaean terrestrial settings (Guy et al., 2012, 2014; Maynard et al., 2013), reflecting the scarce preservation of non-marine sediments during that time. Our results suggest a link between the Archaean sedimentary record and the modern S isotope signal of super-large volcanic eruptions, as well as photochemical experiments under controlled conditions. The S-isotope data indicate mixing of mantle-derived S that has undergone photochemical processing in the predominantly anoxic Archaean atmosphere under \u2018background\u2019 conditions with S delivered to the atmosphere during large volcanic eruptions via a SO2-rich volcanic plume.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting \u2013 the Dominion Group\nThe Dominion Group of the Kaapvaal craton, South Africa, is the oldest preserved intracratonic volcanic succession (Fig. 1\n). It was deposited in a failed rift and rests on an extensive nonconformity that represents craton-scale emergence and erosion (Grandstaff et al., 1986; Jackson, 1992). The up to 2700 m-thick succession is dominated by massive, amygdaloidal mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks, felsic porphyry and strongly rheomorphic ignimbrites interpreted to have been deposited largely in a subaerial environment (Agangi et al., 2020; Jackson, 1992). The Dominion Group is composed of three formations: the sedimentary Rhenosterspruit Formation, the mostly mafic volcanic Rhenosterhoek Formation and the mostly volcanic, felsic-dominated Syferfontein Formation. The presence of pyroclastic deposits (ignimbrites) intercalated with Syferfontein Formation lavas indicates explosive volcanism with Plinian eruption style typical of subaerial intracontinental volcanic provinces. Recent U\u2013Pb zircon ages of felsic volcanic rocks suggest an age of ca. 2960 Ma (Paprika et al., 2021; cf. Armstrong et al., 1991). Ages of the basement granite as young as ca. 3031 Ma (Robb and Meyer, 1995) provide the maximum age for the cycle of granite intrusion, uplift, erosion and deposition of volcanic rocks. The studied samples are from carbonaceous sediments intercalated with felsic volcanic rocks of the Syferfontein Formation that form the upper part of the Dominion Group sequence (Fig. 1B, C). These sediments are inferred to have been deposited rapidly in large volcanic lakes that formed as a direct result and following large-scale volcanic eruptions (Agangi et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nPyrite textures and host-rocks\nIn the study area around the town of Ottosdal, sediments dipping at an average angle of 35\u00b0 to the southwest are intercalated with felsic volcanic rocks and crop out discontinuously for a minimum of several km along strike (Fig. 1). The sediments are colloquially known as Wonderstone and are quarried for their unique characteristics of heat resistance. Sedimentary packages are typically <100 m thick and consist of carbonaceous shale and turbiditic, lithic arenite metamorphosed at lower greenschist facies conditions. The presence of pyrophyllite and diaspore, and the absence of andalusite, constrain the maximum temperature of metamorphism to ca. 320\u00b0C (Agangi et al., 2021). The mineral composition is dominated by pyrophyllite and variable amounts of K-mica, with accessory diaspore, rare earth element (REE)-Al-phosphate and rutile. The shale contains up to 1.5 wt% total organic carbon with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values down to \u221246.6 \u2030 (Agangi et al., 2021).\nThe carbonaceous sedimentary rocks contain sedimentary to early diagenetic pyrite occurring as nodules, semi-massive layers and disseminated fine-grained crystals (Fig. 2\nA and B). The nodules are preferentially developed in discrete sulfidic horizons of black (carbon-rich) shale and were observed at Wonderstone Mine and in a quarry on Driekuil Farm (Fig. 1). The nodules have sub-spherical to ellipsoidal shapes and occur isolated or in clusters of two or more coalescing forms with diameters of up to 8 cm. In cross-section, they often show concentric textures where a core and a rim can be identified (Fig. 2C). The nodules are wrapped by the laminae of the hosting shale, implying formation at an early diagenetic, pre-compaction stage. Compaction led to formation of pressure shadows and cracks in some nodules that are filled with pyrophyllite (Fig. 2C).\nUnder the optical microscope, the rims of pyrite nodules are composed of radially oriented bladed pyrite with spearhead twins (Fig. 3\nA and B). The cores comprise irregular domains with variable density of inclusions (Fig. 3A and C). The inclusion-rich portions of the cores are composed of fine-grained (<10 \u03bcm), euhedral pyrite set in a carbonaceous, phyllosilicate-rich matrix or cemented with pyrite. Several nodules also have relatively massive domains displaying inclusions of 1 \u03bcm or less in size (Fig. 3C).\nOther nodules do not show radial arrangement of crystals and are composed of micrometre-scale euhedral, locally inclusion-rich pyrite (Fig. 3D), similar to the disseminated pyrite found in the rock matrix and in semi-massive pyrite layers. In some of these nodules, euhedral pyrite is cemented with inclusion-rich pyrite (Fig. 3D inset). Semi-massive pyrite layers are formed by fine-grained euhedral crystals, up to 100\u2013200 \u03bcm in size, finely intergrown with matrix minerals (Fig. 3E).\nPyrite also occurs in altered porphyritic volcanic rocks intercalated with sediments at Wonderstone Mine, as disseminated euhedral grains and veinlets associated with pyrophyllite and quartz (Fig. 3F). Based on optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and SEM, the pyrite nodules contain inclusions of pyrophyllite, carbonaceous matter and chalcopyrite (Supplementary Fig. 1). Chalcopyrite was also observed in relatively massive pyrite, forming veinlets cross-cutting the nodules and in volcanic rocks.\n\n\n3.2\nQuadruple S isotope analyses\nQuadruple S isotope analyses were conducted on microdrilled powders using gas-source mass-spectrometry and sulfur fluorination method combined with in situ ion probe (SHRIMP-SI) analyses on all main textural types of pyrite (see Analytical Methods in Supplementary Information). The results are presented in Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 4, 5\n\n and Supplementary Fig. 2. The data show great complexity and sulfur isotope values are largely dependent on texture.\n\nSulfur isotope analyses of microdrilled pyrite nodules\n\nValues of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS for two pyrite nodules with radial fabric range between +2.0 and +6.5 \u2030, and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values range between +0.2 and +0.7 \u2030 V-CDT, with one outlier at \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS = \u22123.2 \u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS = 0.0 \u2030 (Fig. 4A). When the results are plotted according to the relative distance from the centre, clear patterns in both \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values are observed in both nodules (Fig. 5). Both \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values decrease from core to rim, with the exception of one outlier of inclusion-rich pyrite. In contrast, \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values, ranging from \u22125.9 to \u22124.0 \u2030, increase from core to rim. In the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS versus \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS plot (Fig. 4A), the data are tightly grouped, excluding one outlier, and plot along a line with a shallow positive slope of 0.11. This slope contrasts with the ARA having the slope of 0.9, but it closely fits the results of photolysis experiments of SO2 gas using 190\u2013220 nm wavelength Xe laser source (Ono et al., 2013; Whitehill and Ono, 2012).\nIn \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS versus \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS plots (Fig. 4B), the data for microdrilled powders plot in the second quadrant with a strongly negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratio, approximately \u22129 or even lower. When examined in more detail, the data appear to plot along two distinct trends. One trend, represented by analyses of inclusion-rich core domains, passes through the origin and has a slope of approximately \u22129. The second trend, represented by massive core domains and radial rims, intersects the y axis at \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS = \u22123.5 \u2030 and has a slope of approximately \u22124. Both trends are clearly different from the ARA of linear data trends found for Archaean sedimentary rocks that pass through the origin and have slopes of around \u22120.9 to \u22121.5 (Farquhar et al., 2000; Kaufman et al., 2007).\n\nIn situ S isotope analyses\n\nPyrite nodules (both with radial and non-radial fabrics, samples DWS48, DWS49 and DWS49A) mostly have \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values between +4.5 and +10.8 \u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS between \u22120.3 and +0.5 \u2030. However, the pyrite nodule without radial texture from sample DWS48 has a slightly larger range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values, extending down to +1.5 \u2030 (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS < +3 \u2030 are from inclusion-rich pyrite cementing euhedral pyrite grains; Fig. 3D and inset), and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values down to \u22120.5 \u2030 (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 2). Values of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS for the nodules are highly negative, ranging between \u22126.5 and \u22123.7 \u2030, and resulting in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of \u22129 or lower. In a core-to-rim traverse, the radially textured pyrite nodule from sample DWS49 has near-constant \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values in the core (\u223c0.1 \u2030) and progressively increasing values in the rim reaching \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS = 0.5 \u2030 (Supplementary Fig. 2), while \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values are nearly constant throughout (7.0 to 8.5 \u2030). The pyrite nodule from sample DWS49A shows more variable \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, without clear core-to-rim trend (Supplementary Fig. 4A).\nFine-grained, semi-massive pyrite from samples DWS6KA and DWS64 has \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values ranging from \u22120.7 to +4.2 \u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values from +0.2 to +0.9 \u2030. \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values of fine-grained, semi-massive pyrite are \u22124.1 to \u22121.9 \u2030 and in the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS diagram plot along a best-fit line with a slope of \u22122 that intersects the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS axis at negative values (Fig. 4B). Volcanic rock sample DWS39 yielded narrow ranges of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS (+0.2\u2013+2.1 \u2030) and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS (+0.1\u2013+0.3 \u2030) values. In the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS diagram, the data plot relatively close to the origin.\nIn summary, the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of \u22124 and lower of the fine-grained, semi-massive pyrite, pyrite nodules and pyrite hosted in volcanic rocks are markedly different from the ARA.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nProcesses responsible for S isotope fractionation trends displayed by the Dominion Group pyrite\nThe \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS systematics of pyrite from the Dominion Group identify two main trends, which are described in detail below.\n\nShallow\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\n\nS slope and steep\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nS slope: a volcanic photolytic signal of giant volcanic eruption?\n\nThe low \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS ratios (mostly < 1), particularly characteristic for radial nodules (Fig. 4A), and the highly negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios (Fig. 4B) are clearly different from the ARA, but are similar to those observed in photolysis experiments of SO2 using UV light wavelengths of 190\u2013220 nm, whereby SO2 is photo-dissociated according to the reaction 3SO2 + h\u03bd= 2SO3 + S0 (Ono et al., 2013; Whitehill et al., 2015). These experiments produced elemental sulfur (S0) with markedly positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values, low \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS ratios (average 0.09) and steep \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS slope of \u22124.6 on average. Product SO3 and residual SO2 have negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, while product S0 has positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, as expected from mass balance considerations.\nIn addition, similar experiments conducted at variable SO2 gas pressure (Masterson et al., 2011) have demonstrated a strong dependence of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios on pressure, with the ratios ranging from approximately \u22122 at 20 Torr (0.02 bar) to \u221212 at 800\u2013900 Torr (0.8\u20130.9 bar). The \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of S0 could also vary significantly depending on atmospheric transparency during photolysis (Masterson et al., 2011). These experimentally generated \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios are markedly more negative than those typical for sedimentary pyrite from the entire Archaean Eon, ranging from \u22121 to \u22121.5 (Farquhar et al., 2007; Kaufman et al., 2007; Thomassot et al., 2015) and only occasionally to as low as \u22123 (Wacey et al., 2015). This steep \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS trend passing through the origin is however similar to that observed for some pyrite from Palaeoarchaean barite deposits (Muller et al., 2016; Roerdink et al., 2016). Although the steep array with a slope <-1.5 is rarely observed in Archaean sedimentary rocks, a similar trend has been observed in modern volcanic sulfates preserved in polar ice and snow (Baroni et al., 2007, 2008; Savarino et al., 2003). This trend in MIF-S signature is interpreted to be derived from a SO2 isotopologue self-shielding effect that is more strongly expressed at high SO2 partial pressure, a condition that (in the modern, oxygen-rich atmosphere) can only be met during super-large, Plinian eruptions (Lyons, 2009; Whitehill and Ono, 2012) when the volcanic eruption column (plume) reaches into the stratosphere, where low levels of oxygen and ozone allow UV penetration. In the Archaean oxygen-lacking atmosphere, this trend in MIF-S could have been generated in the troposphere as long as high SO2 partial pressure has been maintained, which was not the case for most of the Archaean. The combined highly negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios and small \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values can therefore be considered as a signature of large-volume, subaerial explosive eruptions in the past (Baroni et al., 2007, 2008; Endo et al., 2018; Savarino et al., 2003) and are hereafter referred to as \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 trends.\n\nNegative\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\n\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nS trends that do not pass through the origin: mixing of S sources\n\nIn the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS versus \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS diagram, some data form apparent linear trends that do not pass through the origin and intersect the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS axis at negative values (Fig. 4B). Note that, because of mass-balance considerations, one-step photochemical fractionation trends are expected to cross the origin in the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS versus \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS plot. An offset from the origin with a steeper \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS slope than that of the ARA has also been observed for Mesoarchaean pyrite of the Witwatersrand Supergroup in South Africa (Guy et al., 2012, 2014; Fig. 6) and Palaeoarchaean pyrite associated with hydrothermal barite in Western Australia and South Africa (Roerdink et al., 2016; Wacey et al., 2015), although the mechanism involved in forming these trends is still unclear. Possible explanations for this shift towards more negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values include: 1) mixing phenomena between mass-independently fractionated sulfur compounds (Fig. 7A); 2) entrainment and mixing of atmospheric, mass-independently fractionated sulfur compounds into an ascending volcanic plume followed by photolytic fractionation of sulfur compounds under high SO2 gas pressure (Fig. 7B), and 3) mass-dependent microbially induced sulfate reduction (Ono et al., 2006b). These three mechanisms are further discussed below separately.\n\n1 \u2013 Mixing of S fractionated along the \u2018Archaean reference array\u2019 (\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS \u223c \u22121) and \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 S recording isotope self-shielding at high SO\n2\npressure (\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS \u226a \u22121). In the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS versus \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS plot (Fig. 4B), the trends having negative intersection with the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS axis can be explained by mixing between two S pools, one with positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS and negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values (e.g. \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 S0, similar to that produced during 190\u2013220 nm photolysis experiments; Masterson et al., 2011), and another sulfur compound with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values. For the latter compound, several pathways may be envisaged.\nOne possible pathway includes fractionation along a trend similar to the \u2018Archaean reference array\u2019 resulting in negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of around \u22121, and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS \n>\n0\n\u2030\n, corresponding to the Palaeoarchaean sedimentary barite record from several cratons (Bao et al., 2007; Roerdink et al., 2012). This sulfate produced in the Archaean anoxic atmosphere may have been reduced via either bacterial (more likely for an organic-rich setting) or thermochemical sulfate reduction.\nAnother possible mechanism to obtain sulfide with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values is reduction of SO3 and residual SO2 isotopically similar to those produced in experiments of photoexcitation of SO2 at the wavelength range of 250 nm and higher, which results in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of 0.6 \u00b10.3 (Whitehill and Ono, 2012; Fig. 4B). Although this signature has rarely been observed in Archaean rocks and is therefore not considered important in Precambrian atmospheric S processes (Ono et al., 2013), its S isotopic systematics matches some S isotope data for pyrite from the Mesoarchaean Witwatersrand Supergroup (da Costa et al., 2020; Guy et al., 2014) and Mozaan Group (Ono et al., 2006a) and could potentially explain our observations (Fig. 6\n).\nA set of mixing trends between \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 S derived from S0 aerosols generated during and following Plinian eruptions and photochemically generated sulfate under \u2018background\u2019 Archean atmospheric conditions is shown by blue arrows in Fig. 7\n. Variable SO2 pressure and atmospheric UV transparency expected during a protracted, waxing and waning volcanic eruption could have also contributed to the variations in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS ratio observed for different samples and along transects from core to rim in pyrite nodules. The model requires mixing between strongly fractionated end-members to account for the in situ data for pyrite nodules that have moderately positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and highly negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values, whereas any data plotting close to these potential end-members are missing (Fig. 4A, B).\n\n2 \u2013 Entrainment of atmospheric, mass-independently fractionated sulfur compounds into an ascending volcanic plume followed by mixing with volcanic sulfur and photolytic fractionation of sulfur compounds under high SO\n2\ngas pressure. In addition to mixing of products of photochemical processes, the two MIF-S-producing processes may have been superimposed and combined via entrainment of atmospheric, mass-independently fractionated S compounds (carrying, for example an ARA signature) into a volcanic plume and mixing with volcanic sulfur gas compounds. Entrainment, warming and expansion of air in a volcanic plume represent the main cause of buoyancy, and allow some volcanic eruption columns to reach 40-50 km altitude (Carey and Bursik, 2015; Sparks, 1986). If photochemically generated atmospheric sulfate with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values was entrained into a volcanic plume and exchanged with volcanic SO2 (\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS = \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS =0), \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 MIF-S signature would be imparted on already mass-independently fractionated S species, resulting in an initial S isotope composition of sulfur compounds in a volcanic eruption column off the origin in both the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS plots. The extent of this shift would depend on the amount of entrained atmospheric S relative to the volcanic S in the volcanic eruption column. Entrainment and mixing of atmospheric and volcanic S species in various proportions would result in an array of volcanic fractionation lines, which could explain almost the full distribution of our analyses, in particular the in situ analyses of nodular pyrite in the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS plot (Fig. 4, 5B).\n\n3 \u2013 Mass-dependent sulfate reduction. Microbially induced sulfate reduction can produce mass-dependent S isotope fractionation with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS ratios that slightly deviate from the 0.515 reference line (Johnston et al., 2008a). Analyses of Phanerozoic pyrite have revealed that these microbial processes can produce \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values as low as \u22122.4 \u2030 in association with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values down to \u221223 \u2030, and an average \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS slope of around \u22126.8 (Johnston et al., 2008a, 2008b; Ono et al., 2006b; MD arrow in Fig. 4B). Using this \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS slope, reduction of photochemically produced sulfate with S isotope values corresponding to the ARA could potentially account for the deviation observed. However, to match our results this mechanism would require a shift in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values of up to 7 \u2030, well beyond the range of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values of 2.4 \u2030 that has been measured in Phanerozoic pyrite (Ono et al., 2006b). In addition, the large range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values that should have accompanied this process was not observed in our study. Thus, mass-dependent sulfate reduction is not considered to be the relevant process to explain very low \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS values observed in this study.\nQuadruple sulfur isotope data do not allow to resolve between the models 1 and 2. Both models result in temporal and spatial heterogeneities in the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratio with time and distance from the eruption centre as the volcanic plume ascended, entrained ambient atmosphere, spreads away from the eruption centre, and SO2 gas pressure in the plume progressively decreased (resulting in smaller \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratio). Both mixing models explain the majority of our data, but mass-dependent fractionation mechanisms might have also been involved as indicated by data plotting in Fig. 4A into the quadrant with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values. Considering the high organic carbon content of the sediments in which pyrite formed and the lacustrine setting, microbial sulfate reduction of S compounds delivered from the atmosphere to the lake seems likely. However, due to a low sulfate content in this lacustrine setting and in general in Archaean surface environments, quantitative sulfate reduction within sediments and water column left no obvious signature of microbial sulfate reduction in S isotope systematics. Regardless of the mixing pathway involved, the Dominion Group pyrite nodules record volcanic photolysis and mixing with a \u2018background\u2019 Archean atmospheric signal. We suggest below that this signal had a better potential to be preserved and retain its unique characteristics in terrestrial settings with high sedimentation rates.\n\n\n4.2\nEffect of contrasting depositional timescales on continental vs marine S records\nThe quadruple-S isotope systematics of the Dominion Group pyrite is strikingly different from the ARA and has a strong similarity with that of modern volcanic sulfate aerosols formed in the stratosphere (where low oxygen and ozone contents allowed UV penetration) and preserved in Antarctic ice and ash layers (Baroni et al., 2008; Savarino et al., 2003). This is possibly due to deposition of S aerosols in lakes during the Dominion Group volcanism and stratospheric volcanic sulfate in snow in modern times, which in both cases allowed preservation of transient atmospheric signals, representing \u2018snapshots\u2019 of relatively short-lived, MIF-S-generating events. Importantly, in the case of the Archaean oxygen- and ozone-free atmosphere, similar photochemical reactions were not confined to the stratosphere, and could have occurred at any altitude through the atmosphere. In contrast, the Archaean marine realms would allow to sustain, recycle and homogenise S inputs impacted by various photochemical and aqueous reactions with correspondingly different MIF-S and MDF-S signals (Endo et al., 2016; Halevy, 2013).\nAs photolysis-derived sulfate and elemental sulfur aerosols were deposited in Archaean oceans, their S isotope composition was modified in a larger S-pool over a longer time compared to lacustrine systems and local or short-term isotopic perturbations were not immediately transferred to the rock record (Halevy, 2013). In contrast, sediments deposited in small and short-lived intracratonic basins with high sedimentation rate had higher potential to preserve transient MIF-S signals.\nThe nature of atmospheric S species deposited on land in the Archaean is unclear. Studies of multiple S isotope composition of pyrite from Archaean terrestrial deposits, including palaeosols, diamictites, fluvial deposits and conglomerates have found relatively small ranges in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values with a prevalence of near-zero to slightly negative values (Guy et al., 2012, 2014; Hofmann et al., 2009; Maynard et al., 2013). These results may reflect the interaction between exposed surface of landmasses and highly reactive, sulfuric acid in groundwater, rivers and continental run-off derived from atmospheric sulfate aerosols with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values. Conversely and complementarily, the less reactive and soluble elemental S with positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values may have been preferentially transported off landmasses as a part of the sedimentary load and eventually deposited with marine shales (Maynard et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nQuadruple S isotope data for pyrite from lacustrine sedimentary rocks of the Dominion Group in South Africa indicate mixing of S pools, shedding light on the S-cycle of a Mesoarchaean volcanic lake. Overall, the data provide evidence for two independent photolytic trends: 1) a trend similar to the \u2018Archaean reference array\u2019, which is pervasively preserved in marine sedimentary rocks spanning the entire Archaean and represents an Archaean \u2018background\u2019 signal, and 2) a \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 trend, with a steeper slope in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS vs \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS space, which appears to be recording a discrete, super-large volcanic eruption event.\nThe strongly 36S-depleted S isotope composition implies the operation of specific photochemical reactions that resulted in S isotope systematics different from the more commonly observed \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\u2013\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS trends (e.g., ARA). The \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios of \u22124 and lower (\u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 trend) resemble the composition of sulfate aerosols produced during exceptionally large modern stratospheric eruptions, and are consistent with their production in a dense, optically thick SO2-rich volcanic plume at any altitude in the Archaean, oxygen-deficient atmosphere. This interpretation is also consistent with the geological context of the succession. By extension, the absence of such trend in the Archaean \u2018background\u2019 records provides a constraint for the maximum atmospheric SO2 level in the Archaean.\nAnother implication of our study is that some variations in the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratios could be generated through mixing of \u2018volcanic photolytic\u2019 S with S affected by Archaean \u2018background\u2019 photochemical processes or entrainment of Archean \u2018background\u2019 atmospheric, mass-independently fractionated sulfur compounds into an ascending volcanic plume followed by mixing with volcanic sulfur and photolytic fractionation of sulfur compounds under high SO2 gas pressure. Our study thus suggests that some variations in \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n36\n\n\nS\/\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ratio in the Archean sedimentary records might reflect waxing and waning of subaerial volcanism rather than, and not necessarily through, whole-scale changes in atmospheric composition.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAndrea Agangi: writing, conceptualization, Axel Hofmann: conceptualization, editing, Benjamin Eickmann: data curation, editing, Frantz Ossa Ossa: data curation, editing, Perinne Tyler: data curation, editing, Boswell Wing: data curation, editing, and Andrey Bekker: supervision, editing.\n\n","53":"","54":"","55":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe mid-Carboniferous was an interval of dramatic changes in climate, environment, and biodiversity (e.g., Monta\u00f1ez and Poulsen, 2013). Sedimentological and geochemical data indicate prolonged global cooling associated with the LPIA (Stanley and Powell, 2003; Monta\u00f1ez and Poulsen, 2013) that commenced relatively abruptly in the latest Vise\u00e1n \u2212 early Serpukhovian and ceased \u223c40 Myr later in the early Permian, with high-frequency eustatic cycles (Monta\u00f1ez and Poulsen, 2013) (Fig. 1\nA). Coeval with the development of the glaciation, a mass extinction event occurred in the Serpukhovian Stage that was estimated to have eradicated \u223c26% of marine invertebrate genera globally (Sepkoski, 1996; Stanley and Powell, 2003). Though the taxonomic severity of the Serpukhovian extinction was less than that of the \u201cBig Five\u201d Phanerozoic extinctions, its ecological impacts were possibly more severe than those of the Late Ordovician mass extinction (McGhee et al., 2012). Moreover, global diversity remained low and did not fully recover from the extinction throughout the LPIA (Stanley and Powell, 2003) (Fig. 1A).\nThe approximate temporal coincidence between the LPIA and the Serpukhovian extinction suggests a causal linkage between the two. Several hypotheses linked to the LPIA have been proposed as the main causes of the Serpukhovian extinction, including intensified seasonality, global cooling, and the loss of carbonate habitat (e.g., Stanley and Powell, 2003; Wang et al., 2013; Balseiro and Powell, 2019). However, the potential cause and effect relationship between the glaciation and biodiversity losses remains elusive, and, especially, changes in marine redox conditions during the mid-Carboniferous and their effects on the Serpukhovian extinction remain poorly constrained.\nIn addition to the well-established use of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values to track changes in the early evolution of the marine sulfur cycle (e.g., Halevy et al., 2012; Pasquier et al., 2017; Rennie et al., 2018), recent advances in instrumental techniques have enabled the high-precision measurement of minor S-isotope abundances (i.e., 33S and 36S), allowing the use of quadruple sulfur isotopes to more accurately constrain the biogeochemical sulfur cycles (e.g., Farquhar et al., 2003; Wing and Halevy, 2014; Pellerin et al., 2015a, 2015b; Siedenberg et al., 2016; Crockford et al., 2019). Biological culture experiments coupled with theoretical studies have shown that various microbial sulfur metabolic processes such as sulfate reduction, sulfur re-oxidation, or disproportionation can produce diagnostic minor S-isotopic signatures (Farquhar et al., 2003, 2007; Johnston et al., 2005a, 2005b, 2007; Sim et al., 2011; Leavitt et al., 2014; Pellerin et al., 2015b). The application of minor S-isotopes combined with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS, therefore, can provide additional constraints on the metabolic pathways and sulfur cycling processes in ancient oceans (Shen et al., 2011; Sim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Luo et al., 2018).\nHere, we report multiple S-isotope compositions (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS) of pyrites from the Naqing section (25\u00b0 14\u2032 40\u2033 N, 106\u00b0 29\u2032 26\u2033 E) in South China. We selected the Naqing section because it represents an open-water slope deposit and provides stratigraphically continuous sedimentary records spanning the Carboniferous through Permian (Wang et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014). Based on a framework of robust bio- and fine-scale litho-stratigraphy (Wang et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014), the Naqing section enables us to use multiple S-isotopes to constrain changes in marine redox chemistry and to evaluate the potential linkages to the Serpukhovian extinction.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and stratigraphy\nThe South China Block was situated in the northeast Paleo-Tethys Ocean near the paleo-equator (\u223c0\u201315\u00b0 S) during the Mississippian (Fig. 1B). It consists mainly of the Yangtze Land, Qian-Gui Basin, and Dian-Qian-Gui-Xiang Platform during the Carboniferous (Fig. 1C). Our samples were collected from the Naqing section which was deposited in the Qian-Gui Basin in South China (Fig. 1C). Previous studies of the Naqing section have yielded outstanding biostratigraphical, sedimentological, and geochemical data (e.g., Wang et al., 2013; Qi et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016, 2018, 2019), making it a leading GSSP candidate for the four unratified Carboniferous stages, including the Serpukhovian, Moscovian, Kasimovian, and Gzhelian Stages (Qi et al., 2014). The Naqing section is composed mainly of thin-bedded lime mudstones, laminated bioclastic wackestone to packstones, and normal-graded packstones, intermittently intercalated with chert beds and silicified limestones (Qi et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019) (Fig. 2\n). We sampled the \u223c140-m-thick of the Naqing section which spans the upper Vise\u00e1n \u2212 lower Bashkirian interval that straddles the Serpukhovian extinction (Fig. 2).\nThe Serpukhovian crisis in South China is characterized by a decline in biodiversity of benthic biota and turnover of fossil assemblages during the late Vise\u00e1n \u2212 early Bashkirian (Fig. 2). During this biotic crisis, the major marine clades of the Carboniferous, such as corals, brachiopods and conodonts, experienced significant losses and turnovers (Wang et al., 2006, 2013; Shen et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). For example, the large and dissepimented solitary corals dominating the Vise\u00e1n Stage diminished during the Serpukhovian Stage and they were replaced by compound corals in the Bashkirian Stage, along with the appearances of new taxa, including Kepingophyllidae, Geyerophyllidae, Petalaxidae, and Waagenophyllidae (Wang et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). Brachiopods were abundant during the Vise\u00e1n Stage but experienced a significant decline in diversity in the Serpukhovian Stage (Shen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013). For example, Rhynchonellida, Orthida, Spiriferinida, Orthotetida, and Terebratulida were severely affected (Fig. 2), and the large-sized Serpukhovian Gigantoproductus was replaced by small- to moderate-sized Bashkirian genera (Shen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013). A dramatic variation in conodont assemblages also occurred at the Serpukhovian \u2212 Bashkirian boundary, with the replacement of Lochriea and Gnathodus by Declinognathodus and Idiognathoides (Wang et al., 2013) (Fig. 2).\n\n\n3\nAnalytical methods\n\n3.1\nPyrite sulfur extraction\nPyrite sulfur was extracted using classical chromium reduction procedures (Canfield et al., 1986). Sample powders were treated with a reduced chromium chloride (CrCl2)\/HCl solution for \u223c2 h to completely liberate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by gently heating at \u223c80\u00b0C. The liberated H2S was driven by a flow of nitrogen gas through a water-cooled condenser and a Milli-Q water trap, and then quantitatively recovered as silver sulfide (Ag2S) via reaction with silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. The Ag2S was subsequently filtered, rinsed with Milli-Q water and 1 N NH4OH, and then dried for isotopic measurements.\n\n\n3.2\nSulfur isotopic analyses\nMultiple S-isotope measurements were performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the University of Maryland, following published procedures (Shen et al., 2011). Dried \u223c3 mg Ag2S was weighed and wrapped in a \u223c1 cm2 piece of aluminum foil and then loaded in a nickel reaction vessel where Ag2S was converted to sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) via reaction with 10\u00d7 excess F2 gas at \u223c250\u00b0C overnight. The resulting SF6 was isolated in a liquid-nitrogen-cooled trap from the residual F2 that was passivated through a column of hot potassium bromide (KBr). The SF6 was subsequently distilled at \u223c-110\u00b0C to remove condensable contaminants and then further purified with a gas chromatograph equipped with a composite molecular sieve 5 \u00c5 lead\/Haysep-Q column, operating isothermally at 50\u00b0C, with a 20 mL\/min helium flow rate. The SF6 peak was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector and frozen into two liquid-nitrogen-cooled traps and then transferred to the manifold. S-isotopic measurements of clean SF6 were conducted using a Thermo Finnigan MAT 253 dual-inlet gas source mass spectrometer where the ion beams at \nm\n\/\nz\n=\n127\n, 128, 129, and 131 were detected simultaneously.

The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS of the Vise\u00e1n Stage fluctuates between \u221212.85\u2030 and 7.63\u2030 over the interval of 0 \u2212 23.2 m, followed by a positive excursion to 12.35\u2030 at 41 m (Fig. 2). Correspondingly, the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS show negative values ranging from \u22120.051\u2030 to \u22120.012\u2030, except for a single positive value of 0.006\u2030 at the base of the section. The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values then decrease gradually to \u221219.81\u2030 at 55.4 m in the late Vise\u00e1n Stage.

The corresponding \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS displays negative values varying between \u22120.108\u2030 and \u22120.022\u2030, except for a positive value of 0.023\u2030 at 75.5 m (Fig. 2). Up section, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS decreases gradually to \u221228.10\u2030 at 128 m, from the late Serpukhovian to the early Bashkirian Stage. The \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS then rises to 3.61\u2030 before decreasing to \u221218.78\u2030 at the top of the measured section, and the corresponding \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS ranges from \u22120.066\u2030 to \u22120.002\u2030, except for a positive value of 0.002\u2030 at 110 m (Fig. 2).\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nFramework to interpret \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS data from rock records\nWe used a well-established box model for biogeochemical sulfur cycling to explain the multiple S-isotopic data from rock records (Fig. 3\n). Details of the construction and mathematics of the model are presented in Farquhar et al. (2007) and Zhang et al. (2015, 2017). Briefly, the model illustrates \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS covariations of sulfide produced by different pathways that may involve microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), sulfide oxidation, microbial sulfur-compound disproportionation (MSD), and the mixing of different sulfur reservoirs (Farquhar et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017). In Fig. 3, the field of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS of sulfide produced by MSR is delimited by the gray solid curve where MSD could occur but is not required. The dotted curve illustrates the isotopic limits for sulfide where MSR and MSD are both required (Fig. 3). For the mixing model to explain the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS data from the Naqing section, one endmember has a S-isotopic composition equivalent to that of the contemporaneous seawater sulfate (i.e., \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS = 15.10\u2030, \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS = 0.009\u2030; Wu et al., 2010) (Fig. 3). The other endmember is sulfide produced via MSR in an open system with substantially negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS\n=\n\u2212\n30\n\u2030\n, \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS\n=\n0.001\n\u2030\n), comparable with the most negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values measured from the Naqing section (Fig. 3).\nBased on the locations of the S-isotopic data in quadrants I\u2013IV, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS plot has been employed to study sulfur cycling in Phanerozoic oceans (Shen et al., 2011; Sim et al., 2015; Siedenberg et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Luo et al., 2018; Thomazo et al., 2019). For example, pyrites located in quadrant I, with positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, can result from the quantitative reduction of sulfate in a closed system environment where sulfate consumption is faster than the supply (Scott et al., 2014). The high degree or nearly quantitative reduction of sulfate may produce pyrites with positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS like those of seawater sulfate and positive or negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values (Scott et al., 2014; Sim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017).\nPyrites located in quadrant II, with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, may reflect the typical S-isotopic fractionation processes resulting from MSR, or combined with MSD in an open system with sufficient sulfate supply. The low degree of MSR with or without MSD in this setting would produce pyrites with highly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, as typically observed in modern euxinic environments and Phanerozoic sedimentary records (Johnston et al., 2008; Canfield et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Zerkle et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Siedenberg et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018; Thomazo et al., 2019) (Fig. 4\n). These records are also consistent with the biological culture studies, showing that the sulfides produced by both MSR and MSD are characteristically enriched in 33S relative to the reactant, yielding positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values (Johnston et al., 2005a, 2007; Sim et al., 2011; Leavitt et al., 2014) (Fig. 4).\nThe negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS in quadrant III, however, cannot simply be attributed to either MSR and\/or MSD alone (Shen et al., 2011; Sim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017). Although the results of the model show that the small negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values located within the dotted curve could be generated when MSR and MSD are both involved in sulfide production (Fig. 3), these model outputs, may have resulted from specific boundary conditions in which the sulfide produced by MSR is assumed to be re-oxidized and disproportionated completely (i.e., 100%; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017). It has been shown that the reoxidation of sulfide is a complex and competing process which involves biological and chemical pathways (Zerkle et al., 2009; J\u00f8rgensen and Nelson, 2004). Therefore, the percentage of sulfide reoxidation may depend on the quantity and types of oxidants such as O2, NO\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n, MnO2 and microorganisms involved such as sulfide oxidizers or sulfur disproportionators (e.g., Zopfi et al., 2004). It was estimated that 60 \u2013 97% of sulfide produced from MSR in the area between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea was reoxidized (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 1990). Therefore, the modeled isotopic results assuming that 100% of sulfide is re-oxidized and production of small negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS may not be achievable in nature environments.\nTo interpret the negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS located in quadrant III from rock records, a mixing model has been proposed (Shen et al., 2011). Accordingly, the negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values may be explained by mixing of two types of sulfide with substantially positive and negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values that formed in a closed and open system with respect to sulfate, respectively (Shen et al., 2011; Sim et al., 2015; Siedenberg et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Luo et al., 2018; Thomazo et al., 2019). This two-endmember mixing process can produce intermediate \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, with the absolute values determined by the mixing ratio (Fig. 3). The transition from closed to open systems, or vice versa, may be linked to the instability of marine redox conditions driven by the shoaling of anoxic water (Shen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017; Luo et al., 2018).\nThe negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS in quadrant IV could reflect either mixing processes or Rayleigh isotopic effects (Scott et al., 2014). In either case, this isotopic signature may suggest that the pyrite is dominantly produced under closed system conditions. The high degree of sulfate reduction would decrease the magnitude of sulfur isotope fractionation, leading to an S-isotopic shift in pyrite towards sulfate values (Scott et al., 2014; Sim et al., 2015).\nWe note, however, that the mixing model to account for the negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS compositions has been challenged by the multiple S-isotope studies on the Permian-Triassic rocks from South China (Saitoh et al., 2017, 2021). While this model applied the same framework of mixing two endmember of S-isotopes, it advocated different origins of pyrites (Saitoh et al., 2017, 2021). According to this model, the pre-existing pyrites are formed in a closed system within the sediments and they have positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values, like those of seawater sulfate (Saitoh et al., 2017, 2021). The other endmember of pyrites with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS are formed in an open system, resulting from bioturbation (Saitoh et al., 2017, 2021). However, without mass extinction or a physico-chemical mechanism such as shoaling of deep anoxic water, it would be difficult for the Phanerozoic shallow water sediments such as limestone to frequently switch between bioturbation and non-bioturbation status during diagenesis. In their model, bioturbation is required to produce the negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values (Saitoh et al., 2017, 2021). However, most of the Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks with evidence of bioturbation show positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS compositions, rather than negative ones (Shen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015; Siedenberg et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2018; Thomazo et al., 2019).\n\n\n5.2\nInterpretation of the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS data from the Naqing section\nPrior to the Serpukhovian extinction at Naqing (0 \u2212 57.7 m), the S-isotopic data are located in quadrants I, III, and IV (Fig. 3). One sample (NSS 1.0), with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS of 4.50\u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS of 0.006\u2030, located in quadrant I, may be attributed to a combination of MSD and MSR or quantitative MSR in a closed system. Considering the dominate and strong negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS values for the Naqing section (Fig. 2), resulting from non-limiting sulfate conditions, the positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from 0.61\u2030 to 12.35\u2030 with negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.012\u2030 to \u22120.049\u2030 in quadrant IV (n = 10) suggest Rayleigh isotopic effects in the sediments (Scott et al., 2014). The negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from \u22121.62\u2030 to \u221219.81\u2030 with \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.029\u2030 to \u22120.108\u2030 in quadrant III in this interval (n = 8) implies a mixed isotopic signal that may have resulted from the shoaling of anoxic water, suggesting a transient change of marine redox conditions prior to the Serpukhovian extinction.\nDuring the Serpukhovian extinction interval (57.7\u2013131 m), 4 samples with negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from \u22122.95\u2030 to \u221228.10\u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.009\u2030 to 0.023\u2030 reflect isotopic fractionation effects associated with both MSR and MSD (Fig. 3). Like the data before the Serpukhovian extinction, 4 samples with positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from 0.03\u2030 to 6.79\u2030 and negative \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.023\u2030 to \u22120.053\u2030, located in quadrant IV, may be explained by Rayleigh isotopic effects in the sediments (Fig. 3). More importantly, 17 out of 25 samples during the Serpukhovian extinction interval exhibit the negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS ranging from \u22125.25\u2030 to \u221227.58\u2030 with \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.017\u2030 to \u22120.066\u2030, located in quadrant III (Fig. 3). These negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS compositions are aligned on mixing array, and they reflect the mixing of two distinct groups of pyrite probably driven by episodic incursion of anoxic water into shallow water environment during the biotic crisis.\nAfter the Serpukhovian extinction (131\u2013139 m), 2 samples with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from \u221215.65\u2030 to \u221218.78\u2030 and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.048\u2030 to \u22120.050\u2030, located in quadrant III (Fig. 3), suggest a diminishing shoaling of anoxic water. The positive \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from 0.48\u2030 to 3.61\u2030 with \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS from \u22120.030\u2030 to \u22120.043\u2030 in this interval (n = 2) may be interpreted by Rayleigh isotopic effects in the sediments (Scott et al., 2014).\nIt is important to note that the multiple S-isotopic data from the mid-Carboniferous Chokier Formation (possibly the late Serpukhovian Stage), Belgium, also exhibit negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values located in quadrant III, in addition to negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values located in quadrant II (Siedenberg et al., 2016) (Fig. 3). Though the precise correlation between the Chokier Formation and the Naqing section may be challenging, the euxinic mudstones of the lower Chokier Formation are characteristic of negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS, reflecting mixing signals between different groups of pyrites (Siedenberg et al., 2016). Therefore, the negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS values observed from South China and Belgium suggest that non-steady state sulfur cycling in the mid-Carboniferous oceans, driven by shoaling of anoxic water, are of greater than basin-scale significance.\n\n\n\n6\nImplications of the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS-\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS variations from the rock records\n\n6.1\nImplications for the Serpukhovian extinction\nOur multiple S-isotope data from the Naqing section suggest that, in addition to changes in sea-level and sea-surface temperature, the shoaling of anoxic water may have been a key factor driving the Serpukhovian extinction. Our interpretations are broadly consistent with intermittent marine anoxia in the Carboniferous oceans. Several isotopic and trace elemental data have provided evidence for the expansion of anoxia in many marine basins worldwide during the early \u2013 middle Carboniferous (e.g., Siedenberg et al., 2016; Kabanov et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019). The extensive incursion of deep anoxic water would have reduced the habitable ecospace on shallow shelves and poisoned organisms living in oxic conditions, which consequently led to the biodiversity decline.\nAn important role of shoaling of anoxic deep water in driving the Serpukhovian extinction does not preclude other environmental factors such as global cooling during the LPIA. Instead, the cooling may have enhanced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water and stimulated surface productivity, increased deep-water oxygen consumption due to increased sinking of organic matter, and ultimately expanded deep-water anoxia (e.g., Cartapanis et al., 2016). Furthermore, the episodic shoaling of anoxic water proposed here is also consistent with high-frequency sea-level fluctuations in South China during the mid-Carboniferous (Chen et al., 2019) (Fig. 2). The rapid rise and fall in sea-level may have facilitated episodic encroachment of deep anoxic water onto shallow shelf settings. Therefore, our multiple S-isotopic data provide a link between global cooling, deep-water anoxia, incursion of anoxic water, and the Serpukhovian extinction.\n\n\n6.2\nImplications for the major mass extinction events during the Phanerozoic\nLike the multiple S-isotopic data from the mid-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, minor \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS variation coupled with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS from the modern sediments and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks has emerged as an important tool to constrain the different sulfur metabolisms and sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient oceans (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S2). Biological culture studies usually performed under non-limiting sulfate conditions yield negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS (\nn\n=\n96\n) located in quadrant II (Fig. 4). The modern euxinic sediments (n = 88) from the Black Sea ([SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n] = \u223c17.1 mM), Fayetteville Green Lake ([SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n] = \u223c12\u201316 mM), Cariaco Basin ([SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n] = \u223c28 mM), Lago di Cadagno Lake ([SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n] = \u223c1.1\u20132 mM), and Rogoznica Lake ([SO\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n] = \u223c26\u221229.3 mM) are all characterized by negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and positive \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS located in quadrant II (Fig. 4). However, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS records from the Phanerozoic mass extinction intervals including End-Guadalupian, End-Permian, Smithian-Spathian, Triassic-Jurassic, and Late Devonian, are located in all four quadrants, suggesting dynamic processes of sulfur cycling and ocean chemistry changes during mass extinction events (Fig. 4).\nAlthough there are differences in the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS data from the Phanerozoic extinction events, they have similar negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS data, located in quadrant III (Fig. 4). During each of these Phanerozoic mass extinction events, there is strong evidence for oceanic anoxia (e.g., Bond and Grasby, 2017). Therefore, we suggest that the distinctive signals of negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n34\n\n\nS and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n33\n\n\nS may reflect deep water anoxia in ancient oceans and shoaling of deep anoxic water might have impacted biodiversity throughout the Phanerozoic.\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDongping Hu: data analysis and writing.

The subducting oceanic crust formed \u223c125\u2013140 Ma ago at the Pacific\u2013Izanagi plate boundary (Nakanishi et al., 1989) and is covered by pelagic sediments. Seismic studies have identified horst-and-graben structures in the oceanic crust that are caused by plate bending as the subducting plate approaches the trench (e.g., Nakamura et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2017; Tsuru et al., 2002). A positive free-air gravity anomaly indicates that the outer rise has a flexural bulge shape \u223c150 km seaward from the trench (Choe and Dyment, 2020). And the tectonic history in the Japan trench is interpreted to be dominated by basal erosion (e.g., Shipboard Scientific Party, 1980; von Huene et al., 1994).\nThe largest recorded earthquake along the Japan trench is the tsunamigenic Mw = 9.1 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The exceptional peak coseismic slip during this event was \u226550 m horizontally and \u223c10 m vertically near the trench axis at 38\u00b005\u2032\u201338\u00b035\u2032N (e.g., Fujiwara et al., 2011, 2017; Ide et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2011; Iinuma et al., 2012). This coseismic rupture propagation was affected by the geological setting of the accretionary prism, such as the locations and architectures of plate boundary faults and internal deformation of the wedge, which are influenced by the lithostratigraphy of the incoming plate and the different sources of sediment supply (e.g. Simpson, 2010; Dean et al., 2010). Active-source seismic surveys were conducted in this region to search geological evidence. Observations indicate that the frontal prism at the hypocenter of the Tohoku earthquake (Kodaira et al., 2012, 2017), including the shallowest part close to the trench axis, experienced significant deformation (Boston et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2013, 2020).\nNear-trench slip during the 2011 Tohoku megathrust earthquake controlled the generation of the devastating tsunami (e.g., Hirono et al., 2016); therefore, it is important to investigate megathrust structures, particularly those near the trench axis, to better understand the origin of the coseismic slip. The structure of the frontal prism along the Japan trench has been continuously imaged within a limited region near the epicenter of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Nakamura et al., 2013, 2020). However, the deformation and materials present at shallow depths in neighboring areas, including the entire slip zone of the 2011 event, have yet to be investigated. Based on the on-site observation, a thin pelagic clay layer covering the plate interface may be directly linked to the large slip near the epicenter (Chester et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2015), supported by the rupture simulation (Murphy et al., 2018). Alternatively, numerical models indicate that a compliant prism or low rigidity of rocks overlying the shallow megathrust are required to produce such a tsunamigenic megathrust earthquake (Huang et al., 2016; Jeppson et al., 2018; Prada et al., 2021). South of the epicenter, previous studies have indicated that there is a slip-zone boundary that correlates to an area in which slow earthquakes frequently occur (Nishikawa et al., 2019) and can be defined by a density contrast (Bassett et al., 2016), which is also consistent with high velocity anomalies within the upper plate (e.g., Hua et al., 2020).\nHere we present densely distributed seismic profiles acquired in the immediate vicinity of the Japan trench axis, including the slip transition zone south of the 2011 earthquake epicenter. The unique local structural characteristics in these seismic profiles may explain the coseismic slip behavior.\n\n\n2\nData acquisition and processing\n2-D multichannel seismic surveys were conducted after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The data used herein were collected during the R\/V Kaiyo KY15-14 and R\/V Yokosuka YK17-22 cruises along the Japan trench axis off Miyagi, south of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake epicenter. A total of 38 ESE\u2013WNW lines with \u223c8,000 m line spacing were completed during the survey (Fig. 1). The acquisition system included a 1.2-km-long streamer cable with 192 channels at 6.25 m group interval towed at 6 m water depth, and a 5.24-L air-gun array towed at 5 m water depth and fired every 37.5 m. The seismic reflection data were processed using conventional procedures, including trace editing, common depth point (CDP) binning, denoising, velocity analysis, normal-moveout correction, stacking, and post-stack time migration. Because the limited cable length makes velocity determination difficult, we performed a F-K migration with a constant velocity of 1.525 km\/s for the post-stack time migration. We tested various velocity models based on previous local refraction studies (e.g., Ito et al., 2005; Miura et al., 2005) for the migration and finally chose those resulting in the best migrated images (Fig. S1).\n\n\n3\nResults and discussion\n\n3.1\nGeneral structural variations along the trench\nThe post-stack time-migrated seismic profiles reveal detailed subsurface structures along the Japan trench axis, including the subducting Pacific plate and the lower slope of the wedge-shaped prism within the first 20 km landward of the trench axis. Globally, the entire study area can be divided into four segments according to the structures of the subducting plate beneath the trench and the front of the prism (Figs. 1b, 2\n): (1), that north of 37\u00b0N, (2) that around 37\u00b0N, (3) that south of 37\u00b0N but north of the Joban seamount chain, and (4) that where the Joban seamount chain is being subducted. Given that segment (4) is quite complex, our major focus here is on the first three segments.\nThese lateral variations along the subducting plate have different effects on the deformation front of the accretionary wedge. The topography of the subducting plate is directly associated with the morphology of the wedge: horsts entering the trench may elevate the toe of the prism (Fig. 3\n), whereas grabens may lead to subsidence. The sediments covering the Pacific plate are mainly hemipelagic mud; they vary in thickness along strike from tens to several hundreds of meters (crustal rock outcrop locations, e.g., around CDP17000 in Fig. 3a) and play a key role in wedge-front construction. Generally, the incoming sediments are thinner in the north than in the south (Fig. S2): the average sediment thickness in the seven northernmost profiles (segment 1) is \u223c200\u2013250 m by assuming a sedimentary seismic velocity of 1.8 km\/s (\u223c220-280 ms in two-way traveltime), and the sediments thicken to \u223c350 m (\u223c400 ms) in segments 2 and 3 and to \u223c450 m (\u223c480 ms) where the seamount chain approaches the trench in segment 4. The seafloor is shallower in the north than in the south, indicating that the subducting plate is slightly tilted. Although the thicknesses of incoming sediments do not necessarily correlate with the topography of the oceanic basement, here they seem to reflect the structural segmentation. The wedge-front and near-trench sediments may consist of accreted incoming pelagic sediments (Rabinowitz et al., 2015), diffuse terrigenous hemipelagic sediments derived from Japan (Moore et al., 2015), or slumps from the trench slopes (Ogawa, 2011).\nThe accretionary wedge in the study zone mainly shows chaotic seismic reflection characteristics, as observed in previous studies to the north (e.g., Nakamura et al., 2013, 2020; Boston et al., 2014). The sediments at the toe of the prism comprise accreted incoming hemipelagic mud, and the stratigraphy is clear in some profiles (e.g., HDIB126, 198, 222; Figs. 4, 5\n\n). Further landward, the wedge is highly deformed. These profiles also indicate that wedge-front landslide debris (e.g., HDFK028, HDIB198; Figs. 4a, 5a) can shape the seafloor surface and control the stability of the frontal prism. The thickness and lithology of incoming sediments are known to control the development and growth of accretionary prisms (e.g., McNeill and Henstock, 2014), and the different thicknesses of incoming sediments in the north and central segments produced different prism toe structures; the prism front is more complex in the north, whereas reverse faults are clear where the overriding sedimentary layer is thicker farther south. The Joban seamount chain, which is approaching the subduction trench, also contributes to shortening the features at the prism toe because of the highly compressive stress field (Fig. 5b).\nThe topography of the oceanic basement near the trench axis and the prism front, and on the seaward slope of the trench, is mainly characterized by bending-related normal faults bounded by horsts and grabens, following the seafloor bathymetric features (Figs. 3, 4, 6\n). Segments 1 and 2 are characterized by horst-and-graben structures with vertical offsets decreasing to the south, whereas segment 4 is very rugged because of the incoming Joban seamount chain. The basement in segment 3 is relatively smooth but also faulted (Fig. 2). Two sets of normal fault systems are caused by pre-existing weaknesses or crustal fabrics due to subduction (Nakanishi, 2011). One set, formed by plate bending, is parallel or sub-parallel to the trench axis (mainly striking NNE\u2013SSW) with vertical offsets increasing toward the trench (Figs. 7\n, S4). The second set, corresponding to reactivated oceanic spreading fabrics, is oblique to the trench axis (striking ENE\u2013WSW) with little vertical offset variations, and these vertical offsets are much smaller than those of the trench-parallel group (Figs. 7, S4). In our seismic data, the prominent normal fault scarp offsetting the basement reflection beneath the trench axis strikes NNE\u2013SSW in the northern region along profiles HDFK20\u2013HDFK100. In contrast, in the central region (south of profile HDFK108), the incoming basement is mainly offset by ENE\u2013WSW normal faults with smaller vertical offsets (Figs. 3, 4, 6, S4). The largest vertical offset of the trench-parallel normal faults is \u223c0.4 km along profile HDFK060 (Fig. 6) in the trench axis, which exposes some basement outcrops near the trench axis (profile HDFK044, Fig. 3b). Although it is unclear what is the role of such normal faults that reached the seafloor during the propagation of the megathrust rupture, these pre-existing weak structures may have been preferentially triggered by the megathrust event. Indeed, these structures near the trench axis are located only in the north of the study zone, within the slip zone of the 2011 event.\nThe top of the subducting crust is not easily identified in most of our seismic profiles because a well-preserved chert layer tens to hundreds of meters thick obscures the reflector of the underlying basaltic crust (e.g., Nakamura et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2015; Fujie et al., 2020). The on-site observed pelagic clay layer regarded as an important factor for controlling the coseismic slip propagation is only several meters thick (Chester et al., 2013) and is difficult to image by seismic reflection.\n\n\n3.2\nDouble reflection layers near the plate interface around 37\u00b0N\nIn our profiles, we do not observe a subducting channel bounded at the top by a clear, low-angle detachment fault extending to the toe of the wedge, as observed in the Nankai subduction zone (e.g., Moore et al., 2009); here, the d\u00e9collement is regarded as the plate interface. However, in the central part of our study area (Fig. 7, dark blue traced region), especially in profiles HDIB116-HDIB158, a pair of strong reflectors has similar crustal seismic reflection patterns at \u223c6\u20137 km landward from the trench and near the depth of the plate interface (Figs. 8\n, S3). The lower reflector corresponds to the plate interface, representing either part of a graben structure (profiles HDIB116, HDIB126) or the smooth, consistent interface (e.g., HDIB174). The upper reflections have anticlinal shapes including multiple reflections and obviously branch from the plate interface up dip. In some of these profiles (Fig. 8), the shallower reflections appear as a single clear reflector with opposite polarity compared to the seafloor reflection, indicating a weak layer. Furthermore, seaward from the branching point, the prism often includes thrust features, whereas the wedge is more chaotic landward from the branching point.\nThe geometry of the subducting plate should control the regional morphology of the seafloor, especially because the Japan trench is widely accepted as a subduction-erosion prism formed by the seaward, gravity-driven deposition of sediments (e.g., von Huene et al., 1994, 2004; Tsuru et al., 2000). However, the graben structures along profiles HDFK116 (CDPs 19,500\u201321,000), HDIB118 (CDPs 20,000\u201321,500), and HDIB126 (CDPs 20,000\u201321,500; Figs. 8, S3) did not lead to wedge subsidence, in contrast, the seafloor is elevated above the shallower strong reflectors (Fig. S3). The elevation of the seafloor may link to the seaward bound of the subducting graben, which also resulted in a step-up d\u00e9collement. The formation of these structures can be explained by the critical taper theory (Dahlen et al., 1983; Davis et al., 1983; Bauville et al., 2020): the seaward bound of the graben causes the d\u00e9collement to step up, the increase of the basal angle causes the stress field to become compressional, and the incoming sediments along the plate interface near the graben are pushed up, potentially building stacking nappe structures (Fig. 9\n). Based on the reflection polarity, we interpret the shallower bright reflectors to be the top of low-velocity layers; they may therefore work as a subsequent d\u00e9collement. In this interpretation, the layers between these strong reflectors and the plate interface should be the nappe structure formed by the subducting channel sediments, which might be highly deformed at such depths.\nThese d\u00e9collement-like layers probably formed as underplated duplex structures due to underlying thrusts (Figs. 9a, b). Subduction channels are bounded by thrusts at the top and bottom, developed Riedel shears and basal thrust faulting, and then turned to be dynamic shear zones (Collot et al., 2011). Some of the older bulk segments on the downdip side of the channel may progressively shear off, becoming incorporated into the upper plate on the updip side of the channel to form a duplex structure (Fig. 9; Collot et al., 2011). Another possible mechanism is related to the pre-existing, weak \u201cdancing\u201d (oscillating) fault zone produced by the subduction of a half-graben (Koge et al., 2018). This dancing fault zone might migrate with the subducting graben structure (Figs. 9c, d), along with the stacked nappe structure formed by the step-up d\u00e9collement and the local overpressure stress in the graben. Furthermore, the flakes of the uppermost subducting basement may be peeled off and incorporated in the bottom of the subduction channel. This may also explain that we can only observe chert-layer reflections on the updip side of the branching point but they disappear under the channel further down dip (Fig. 8). These processes would lead to a fast growth of the wedge, which would explain why the seafloor is elevated above the shallow strong reflectors.\nAlternatively, the structure of the subducting plate exerts a key control on the shear stress field, and the d\u00e9collement could step up and propagate over a breached crustal normal fault (e.g., profiles HDFK116, HDIB126, HDIB118). Crustal normal faults also provide pathways for fluid migration from deeper areas; the dewatering and compaction of internal sediments along the subduction channel could weaken the upper part of the channel and deactivate the basal d\u00e9collement, leading to the upward migration of the original roof d\u00e9collement (von Huene et al., 2004). This process could also explain the multiple inner reflectors within the channel body (Fig. 8). Seismic activity is low near the updip segment of the channel, a zone considered to be very weak and aseismic (Fig. 1; Byrne et al., 1988; Obana et al., 2021), and the southern part of this zone is near the source of a very low frequency earthquake swarm, suggesting that the channel-like sedimentary unit extends further down dip (Fig. 1; Nishikawa et al., 2019).\n\n\n3.3\nD\u00e9collement development within the subducting graben beneath the trench axis\nThe step-down of the d\u00e9collement into the trench graben in the zone of large slip during the 2011 event has been discussed in previous studies (Kodaira et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2013, 2020; Boston et al., 2014). In our study zone, we observed a near-trench subducting graben in six profiles (HDFK060\u2013HDFK100; Figs. 6, 7), from north to south, that document the structural evolution of a subducting graben. Along profiles HDFK060 and HDFK068, the extended detachment fault above the horst cannot be traced into the adjacent graben beneath the trench, where the graben has only relatively recently entered the trench. As the subduction of the graben progresses, represented by profiles HDFK076\u2013HDFK100, a low-angle, seaward-dipping reflector that works as a basal fault descends into the graben from the adjacent horst block. However, although the basal detachment operates as a d\u00e9collement in the graben, it occurs only on a slight step-down trend following the shape of the graben, and the deformation structures in the overlying sediments are not as well developed as those in the large slip zone where the d\u00e9collement is close to the top of the chert layer sitting just above the basement (Nakamura et al., 2013), or even shallower farther north (Kodaira et al., 2012), since the depth of the d\u00e9collement depends on the size of the subducted graben according to the critical taper theory (Dahlen et al., 1983; Davis et al., 1983; Bauville et al., 2020). Here in the trench graben, the deformation of buried trench thrusts and folds rooted on the d\u00e9collement may start later or develop slower than farther north, which is only slightly evidenced along profiles HDFK076 and HDFK084. Other profiles show the chaotic seismic characteristics of gravity-driven sediment accumulation in the frontal wedge, and no deformation is observed within the subducting graben sediments. Furthermore, the dynamic thrust-faulting system connecting the stair of the half graben and toe of the prism, which formed before the d\u00e9collement stepping down (Koge et al., 2018), is not well imaged in our seismic profiles; only some traces are visible, but they do not reach the seafloor. In summary, the deformation structures within the subducting graben in our study area are different from those in the central slip zone of the 2011 earthquake (Nakamura et al., 2013), suggesting that coseismic slip did not reach the trench axis in this region.\nThe location and geometry of the updip d\u00e9collement is potentially controlled by local stresses or displacements. Because the regional structures in our study area are different from those in the central rupture zone of the 2011 earthquake, where a step-down d\u00e9collement overprinted by a mature fault system is well developed (Nakamura et al., 2013, 2020; Boston et al., 2014), coseismic slip showed different patterns in these two locations because of the different stress fields and deformed subsurface structures, even though both areas include grabens subducting beneath the trench.\n\n\n3.4\nAlong-trench seismicity variations versus subsurface structural variations\nNorth of \u223c37\u00b0N, seismicity with normal-faulting focal mechanisms has been recorded within \u223c30 km landward of the trench (e.g., Dziewo\u0144ski et al., 1981; Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2012); these are intraplate normal-faulting earthquakes (Obana et al., 2021). Whereas south of \u223c37\u00b0N, earthquakes were observed along the top of the subducting oceanic crust beneath the landward slope of the trench, and they have reverse-faulting focal mechanisms (Obana et al., 2021), with tremor activities distributed around (Fig. 1; Nishikawa et al., 2019; Ohta et al., 2019). This along-trench variation of seismic activities suggests distinct physical properties of the subsurface structure to the north and south of 37\u00b0N.\nSeismic profiles north of 37\u00b0N show that the toe of the prism is chaotic and that crustal normal fault scarps striking mainly NNE\u2013SSW offset the basement (Fig. 4a). South of 37\u00b0N, strata are deformed at the toe of the prism (e.g., Fig. 5b) and reverse faulting and fold structures are observed (e.g., HDIB126 and HDIB222, Figs. 4b and 5b, respectively). Accumulated stresses resulted in shortening structures at the prism front, especially near the front of the subduction of the Joban seamount chain (profiles HDIB206\u2013230), which are quite different from the structures to the north. These observations explain well the distinct seismic activities to the north and south of 37\u00b0N (Obana et al., 2021). The normal faults in the vicinity of the northern trench are more active, as evidenced by the denser seismicity there than in the southern trench (Obana et al., 2021). Considering that normal faults transition from trench-parallel (NNE\u2013SSW striking) north of \u223c37\u00b0N to abyssal hill-parallel (ENE\u2013WSW striking) south of \u223c37\u00b0N (Fig. 7), the former are more active than the latter under the toe of the prism. In contrast, the smoother plate interface south of 37\u00b0N (e.g., profiles HDIB126 and HDIB158, Fig. 4) might facilitate megathrust earthquakes, indicating different coupling conditions in these two zones.\n\n\n\n4\nImplications for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake\nSeismogenic behavior along megathrusts in subduction zones may be controlled by along-trench structural variations (Bassett et al., 2016; Kodaira et al., 2017) and the lithostratigraphy along the subduction interface (Wallace et al., 2003; Dean et al., 2010). Coseismic slip during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake rapidly propagated south near 37\u00b0N (Fig. 1; e.g., Koketsu et al., 2011; Lay, 2018), which coincides with the forearc segment boundary characterized by contrasting residual gravity anomalies and densities of the overlying sediments (Fig. 1; Bassett et al., 2016). On both sides of this forearc segment boundary (Fig. 1; Bassett et al., 2016), the subsurface structures along the megathrust are different, which can be seen from segments 1 and 2 in our study zone: the distribution of horst-and-graben features beneath the toe of prism in the segment 1 are denser, and these irregular structures are covered by thinner sediments than those farther south; while the neighboring segment 2, where the graben enters the subduction zone, operated as a transition zone for coseismic slip propagation at the trench, probably because there is no well-developed thrust fault reach the seafloor based on our observations. Further south, segments with smoother subducting basement profiles near the trench axis are beyond the slip zone. Indeed, regional seafloor geodetic measurements show contrasting seaward motion in the south and post-seismic landward motion within the main rupture area (Fig. 1; Tomita et al., 2017).\nAlong-strike frictional properties are known to directly control slip behavior (e.g. Nishikawa et al., 2019). In our study zone, the roughness of the subducting crust varies along strike and may result in eroded upper-plate materials being subducted, reducing in turn along-strike variations of frictional properties. The subducting basement is rough near the trench axis in the north (segment 1; Fig. 2) and becomes smoother in segment 2, which is the transition zone. Further south, in segments 3 and 4, the basement is offset by the ESE\u2013WSW normal faults and has a much smoother surface than in the north (Fig, 4). These variations in the roughness of the plate interface may lead to diverse frictional behaviors. A thick, subducting, channel-like structure discussed earlier that located beneath the seafloor steepen sector in the central two segments (Figs. 1, 7), spatially coincides with a high-velocity anomaly along the upper boundary of the subducting plate at 36.5\u201337.3\u00b0N (e.g., Hua et al., 2020). The downdip side of this area has hosted frequent slow earthquakes (Fig. 1; Nishikawa et al., 2019; Ohta et al., 2019), impeding the 2011 earthquake rupture propagation (Fig. 1a; Nishikawa et al., 2019), which is similar to the cases of 2012 Mw = 7.6 Costa Rica (Dixon et al., 2014) and 2016 Mw = 7.8 Pedernales earthquake (Rolandone et al., 2018). The areas hosting frequent slow events during inter-seismic phase but did not rupture during the mainshock, release a large fraction of the interseismic strain and revealed regions of velocity-strengthening that may have limited rupture propagation during the megathrust earthquake nucleation (Shibazaki and Shimamoto, 2007; Dixon et al., 2014). On the other hand, the slow earthquakes are associated with fluid migrations because the fluid pressure plays a fundamental role in fault behavior (e.g. B\u00fcrgmann, 2018; Sibson, 2017), also leading to the frictional properties changing along the inter-plate fault zone. Hence, the coincidence of this regular slow earthquakes rupture zone with the landward extension of the observed subducting channel contributes to controlling the dominant aseismic slip and frictional properties along the plate interface.\nThough the along-strike sub-seismic frictional properties are very important for the rupture dynamics, other physical characters such as fault material, pore pressure and other potential means of causing local change in rock rigidity of the overthrusting plate also can be a determining factor for the coseismic slip behavior at shallow depth under certain circumstances (Prada et al., 2021; Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2018). The lithology and density of the overriding plate vary along strike indicating the elastic properties are different (Bassett et al., 2016). On the other hand, as the flux of incoming sediments increases from north to south, so does the thickness of accreted wedge sediments and the size of the prism toe (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the low seismic velocity anomaly along the upper boundary of subducting plate north to the forearc segment boundary and high velocity anomaly to the south (Hua et al., 2020). Therefore, the materials in the frontal accretionary prism are slow and compliant in the northern part of our study region, with low shear modulus values, and trenchward decreasing rigidity of the upper plate. The recent studies suggest tsunamis are preferentially generated by megathrusts with lower rigidity, which is directly controlled by the density and shear-wave velocity at the base of the upper plate (Jeppson et al., 2018; Prada et al., 2021; Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2021). The velocity weakening zone and hence, lower rigidity, of upper plate rocks in the north than in the south of 37.3\u00b0N may explain the difference in near-trench slip at both sides of this limit.\nA several-meters-thick, Paleogene pelagic clay layer in the plate boundary fault zone has been thought to enhance shallow slip near the trench (Chester et al., 2013), resulting in the tsunami generated during the 2011 event (Hirono et al., 2019). The presence of this weak mineral probably acts as a key control of seismic slip and interseismic creep, similar to the case in Sumatra (Dean et al., 2010; Qin and Singh, 2017), San Andreas fault system (Lockner et al., 2011), and Barbados (Maltman et al., 1997). Although the resolution of the seismic reflection technique is too low to image such a thin clay layer, drilling data show that the chert layer overlaying the basement is always accompanied by the clay layer and had been found in numerous boreholes northeast of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Moore et al., 2015). If we assume these clay-chert lithologies are a fixed collocation, which means in our study region, the weak pelagic clay layer also exists (e.g., Figs. 4, 8). However, since the modelling results suggest the slip motion terminate at \u223c37.3\u00b0N, the clay layer on site act as a relatively low-friction layer (Fulton et al., 2013) might favor coseismic slip, but the amount of slip was probably controlled by other factors of the fault zone, such as thermal pressurization, impermeable conditions (Ujiie et al., 2013), and the clay content and clay mineralogy. As seismic slip could be promoted even in unstrained portions at shallow depths (Ujiie et al., 2013), the smectite rich clay layer has been regarded as the host material of large shearing slip, its thickness and the rock rigidity of overlay and underneath surrounding minerals (Prada et al., 2021), along with the fluid-saturated and thermal conditions, could also play an important role on controlling slip behavior and the amount of fault slip. Furthermore, because the seamount-like structures have an effect on the pelagic clay sedimentation, the various roughness of the downgoing plate may also indirectly act on compartmentalizing earthquake failure in the south (Moore et al., 2015).\nOur seismic profiles do not show that pre-existing splay faults reaching the seafloor at the frontal wedge, which are widely observed and regarded as an important factor for the tsunami generation (e.g. Tanioka and Satake, 1996; Moore et al., 2007). However, there are some normal faults nearly breaching the seafloor in the northernmost segment (especially at basement outcrop locations, e.g. CDP 17200 in Fig. 3a). The weak zones around these buried faults lead to large horizontal and vertical tensile stresses at the fault tips (Martel and Langley, 2006), making them candidates for rupture propagation to the seafloor. The segment-2 transition zone without any well-developed thrust faults in the graben and the thick subduction channel further south (Fig. 1) may have attenuated slip during the 2011 earthquake. Furthermore, large earthquake-triggered slumps may represent significant contributions to the accretion of trench sediments into the forearc (Strasser et al., 2013). However, although such slump features are observed in some profiles (e.g., HDFK028, HDIB198; Figs. 4, 5), there are few indications in our seismic data show any displacements reached the seafloor. The lack of seafloor elevation data from before and after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the lack of seafloor reflectivity data to identify the fresh scarp afterwards makes it difficult to conclude whether the rupture reached the trench in this area.\nDeformation of the subducting basement varies along the Japan trench, indicating regional differences in slab rheology. Lithospheric flexure along plate-bending normal faults prior to the subduction of the incoming Pacific plate is known to have caused hydrothermal activity that may have heated the subducting oceanic crust through thermal blanketing by impermeable sediments, and possibly serpentinization (Kawada et al., 2014; Granot and Dyment, 2019; Choe and Dyment, 2020). Such thermodynamical phenomena also affect the local thermal pressurization, fluid saturation, rock rigidity and other elastic rock properties, as well as fault-zone rheology of megathrust, which control the amount of slip during the seismic rupture. Because many other factors could play significant roles in generation of shallow ruptures, seafloor deformation, and tsunamigenesis in near-trench megathrust zones, such as local geology and tectonics, changes in frictional conditions, roughness of the down-going plate, etc., more data is required for further analysis.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nOur seismic data acquired from the southern limit of the zone of large coseismic rupture during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (around 36\u201337.5\u00b0N) show near-trench and along-strike subsurface structural variations, including typical regional structures distributed in four different segments. These diverse segments may have formed because of differences in the thickness of subducting sediments and the morphology of the subducting oceanic crust, which was offset by normal faults and reactivated oceanic spreading fabrics. A transition zone lacking in well-developed thrust faults beneath the trench at \u223c37\u00b0N indicates the 2011 earthquake coseismic slip did not reach there. The roughness of the subducting basement affects the physical properties at and above the plate interface, and the regional structural heterogeneities lead to different seismic behaviors in different locations. Furthermore, a thick, weak zone corresponding to a subduction channel was observed in the central part of the study zone, and its landward extension may play a role to explain the occurrence of slow earthquakes.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nY.Q.: Data analysis, interpretation, and paper writing.

Although it is widely accepted that TTG magmas were produced by partial melting of hydrated basaltic sources (i.e. amphibolite, Barker and Arth, 1976), the geodynamic setting(s) in which they formed is debated (Kleinhanns et al., 2003; B\u00e9dard, 2006; Moyen, 2011; Johnson et al., 2017; Pourteau et al., 2020; Smithies et al., 2021).\nVariations in the trace element compositions of TTG are commonly argued to reflect the pressure of melt generation (Moyen, 2011). Most TTGs were likely produced by fluid-absent anatexis (\u2018dehydration melting\u2019) of garnet-bearing amphibolite in shallow subduction systems or the deeper levels of thick Archean primary (oceanic) crust (Johnson et al., 2017). However, around 20% of TTG have elevated Sr, Al2O3 and Na2O contents, which some think reflects partial melting of deeply-subducted oceanic crust at pressures exceeding plagioclase stability (>2.5 GPa, Moyen and Stevens, 2006). By contrast, others have argued that these \u2018high-P\u2019 signatures may indicate either hydrous-fluid-fluxed (\u2018wet\u2019) melting of amphibolite (Pourteau et al., 2020) or fractional crystallisation of hydrous mafic\u2013intermediate magmas at shallow or deep crustal levels (Kleinhanns et al., 2003; Smithies et al., 2021; Liou et al., 2022)\nRegardless of the tectonic setting, a critical role for fluids is implicated in nearly all models of TTG formation (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2022; Smithies et al., 2021). Seawater is an obvious source of this water, particularly given that a global ocean likely covered most of Earth's surface in the early Archaean (Bindeman et al., 2018). Moreover, silicification during seafloor alteration likely played an important role in increasing the SiO2 content, and thereby the potential melt fertility, of the hydrated mafic (amphibolite) protoliths (Stuck and Diener, 2017, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2022).\nIn addition to near-surface environments, various lines of evidence indicate the existence of a deep fluid reservoir in the early Earth (Byerly et al., 2017; Sobolev et al., 2019; Smithies et al., 2021). Many greenstone sequences contain enriched and \u2018boninite-like\u2019 rocks derived from depleted mantle peridotite that interacted with trace-element-enriched fluids released from recycled supracrustal material (Smithies, 2002). Many Archaean cratons also preserve high-Mg basaltic rocks with variolitic textures and trace-element enriched high-Mg porphyritic diorite (i.e. sanukitoid), both of which are believed to originate via fluid-fluxed melting of lithospheric mantle peridotite (Shirey and Hanson, 1984; Murphy et al., 2021). In addition, ancient diamonds containing harzburgitic inclusion assemblages with suprachondritic initial 187Os\/188Os ratios indicate growth in melt-depleted lithospheric mantle that had been metasomatized by hydrous carbon-bearing fluids (Westerlund et al., 2006). Despite these varied lines of evidence, the source of fluids and the mechanisms by which they were transported into the deep crust and lithospheric mantle are poorly understood.\nOn the modern Earth such mantle metasomatism occurs above subduction zones, where oceanic crust and overlying sediment are buried and heated, initiating dehydration reactions that release H2O (and CO2) and fluid-mobile trace elements into the surrounding mantle (Peacock, 1990), inducing partial melting. The pressure\u2013temperature (\nP\n\u2013\nT\n) conditions at which dehydration reactions occur are a function of the composition of the subducted material, but generally occur around the greenschist\u2013amphibolite facies transition at temperatures of 350\u2013500\u00b0C for typical oceanic crustal materials (Peacock, 1990; Hacker et al., 2003). Accordingly, the evidence for fluid-mediated mantle metasomatism in the Archaean might suggest that subduction-like processes characterised by cold geotherms were in operation (Westerlund et al., 2006), such that dehydration could occur below the Moho (Foley et al., 2002). However, a paucity of evidence from the metamorphic rock record for geotherms characteristic of subduction processes before around 2.0 Ga (<500\u00b0C.GPa\u22121, Weller and St-Onge, 2017; Brown and Johnson, 2018) requires some other mechanism to transport fluids to upper mantle depths in the early Earth.\nVariations in bulk-rock MgO content affect the abundance and stability of hydrous ferromagnesian silicate minerals, such as chlorite, serpentine and amphibole (Palin and White, 2016; Starr and Pattison, 2019). These minerals accommodate significant amounts of water as crystal-bound OH\u2212, such that variability in their modal abundance and stability profoundly affects the capacity of a given rock to retain water (Palin and White, 2016). Burial of hydrated ultramafic rocks in the lower crustal and lithospheric mantle portions of subducting slabs is a potentially important pathway for deep volatile recycling in modern subduction zones (van Keken et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the role of primitive mafic\u2013ultramafic crust in the Archaean lithospheric water cycle has not been explored.\nThe generation of ultramafic magmas (MgO >18 wt%) formed by high-degree partial melting of mantle peridotite requires extreme temperatures (>1600\u00b0C), consistent with an Archaean mantle that was significantly warmer than at present (Herzberg et al., 2007). Consequently, Archaean primary crust is characterised by considerable variability in its MgO content (Fig. 1\n and Fig. S1). At one extreme are komatiites, ultramafic (MgO >18 wt%) lavas that generally comprise about 2\u20135 percent by volume of exposed Archaean volcanic sequences, but which locally may be much more abundant (up to 30 vol.%, de Wit and Ashwal, 1995). In addition, Archaean greenstone sequences commonly contain high- and ultrahigh-MgO picrites, \u2018boninite-like\u2019 rocks, and ultramafic intrusive rocks such as pyroxenites and peridotites that formed by fractional crystallisation in mafic\u2013ultramafic magmas (Szilas et al., 2015; Guice et al., 2018). The common development of pillow structures in many mafic and ultramafic rocks, along with oxygen isotopic and other geochemical data, indicates that the continents were almost entirely submerged in the Archaean (Flament et al., 2008; Johnson and Wing, 2020; Staude et al., 2020). The higher eruption temperatures and lower viscosities of ultramafic magmas means they were much more likely to have been erupted onto the Archaean seafloor and extensively hydrated (and silicified) during subsequent hydrothermal alteration (Dann, 2001; Kump and Barley, 2007, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2022).\nHere, we present the results of phase equilibrium modelling of three representative mafic\u2013ultramafic compositions (Fig. 1, Fig. S1, Tables S1 and S2), a metabasite (MgO \u223c7 wt% MgO), a high-MgO metabasite (\u223c14 wt% MgO), and an ultrahigh-MgO metabasite (\u223c25 wt% MgO), to investigate how MgO content affects the fluid budget of primary Archaean crust during prograde metamorphism. Ultrahigh-MgO metabasites are defined here as any extrusive or shallow crustal intrusive rocks with MgO >18 wt %, and include hydrated komatiites, ultrahigh-MgO picrites and boninite-like rocks, as well as pyroxenite and peridotite cumulates (e.g. Szilas et al., 2015). We show that the temperature at which major devolatilization occurs is positively correlated with protolith MgO content and that metamorphosed ultramafic rocks (MgO >18 wt%) undergo dehydration by chlorite breakdown at temperatures in excess of 700\u00b0C. This means these rocks would have provided a key source of H2O in the deep crust and\/or lithospheric mantle in the early Earth.\n\n\n2\nFluid budgets during burial and heating\nSimplified isochemical \nP\n\u2013\nT\n diagrams (pseudosections) for the three modelled compositions are shown in Figs. 2\nA\u2013C, and include the (dis)appearance of key minerals along with contours for H2O production (as mol.%, \u223cvol.%). Also shown are four geotherms ranging between 1100 and 500\u00b0C.GPa\u22121. The full phase diagrams are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Figs S2\u20134) along with details of their calculation. Curves showing the cumulative amount of H2O released from each rock type with increasing temperature are shown in Fig. 2D\u2013F. Changes in mineral modes in each rock type are depicted in modebox diagrams in Fig. S5.\nRegardless of the geotherm, burial and heating of a typical fully-hydrated (seawater-altered) Archaean metabasite produces a maximum of around 5 vol.% H2O. Most H2O is produced across a narrow temperature interval between 450 and 510\u00b0C corresponding to the breakdown of actinolite and chlorite to form hornblende (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2). Less than 1 vol.% H2O is released with further increases in temperature (Fig. 2D) until the H2O-saturated (\u2018wet\u2019) solidus is reached at around 700\u00b0C, at which point any free H2O is consumed to form melt. For the high-MgO metabasite (Figs. 2B and 2E, Fig. S3), H2O is mainly released in two dehydration steps. The first step, at 460\u2013500\u00b0C, is associated with the actinolite to hornblende transition to produce 3 vol.% H2O. A second dehydration event is related to the breakdown of chlorite, the stability of which is extended to higher temperatures than in the basalt. The temperature interval over which chlorite breaks down is moderately pressure dependent, occurring at temperatures between 545 and 555\u00b0C along a warm 1100\u00b0C.GPa\u22121 geotherm, but between 610 and 650\u00b0C along cooler geotherms (500\u00b0C.GPa\u22121). At temperatures above chlorite breakdown, there is negligible additional H2O produced before reaching the H2O-saturated solidus around 800\u00b0C. Overall, the representative high-MgO metabasite produces some 8 vol.% H2O, about 60% more H2O than an equivalent volume of Archaean basaltic material.\nThe calculated phase equilibria for the ultrahigh-MgO metabasite (Figs. 2C and 2F, Fig. S4) shows some important differences from the other compositions. At lower temperatures, antigorite (serpentine) is stable, and its breakdown to form olivine marks the first major dehydration event, which liberates around 6 vol.% H2O between 480 and 600\u00b0C. However, chlorite breakdown occurs at much higher temperatures of between 700 and 800\u00b0C, releasing a large volume of H2O (around 14\u201316 vol.%). Thus, ultrahigh-MgO metabasites can store then liberate around four times as much H2O as an equivalent volume of Archaean low-MgO metabasite, most of which is released at substantially higher temperature (Fig. 2F). Although the presence of CO2 from devolatilising carbonate within mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks affects the phase equilibria (Elmer et al., 2006; Powell et al., 1991), CO2 plays an insignificant role in the temperatures of antigorite and chlorite breakdown for plausible quantities of carbonate within the protolith (Fig. S6).\n\n\n3\nConsequences for volatile recycling in the early Earth\nOn modern Earth, the upper (basaltic) levels of oceanic crust show limited variability in MgO content (mainly 7\u20139 wt%) (White et al., 2014), and dehydration reactions occur over a restricted temperature range (350\u2013500\u00b0C) (Hacker et al., 2003). By contrast, our phase equilibrium modelling indicates that, on burial and heating, metamorphic fluids would have been released from compositionally-variable Archaean mafic\u2013ultramafic crust over a much wider range of temperatures and pressures\/depths (Fig. 2).\nWhether release of hydrous fluids occurs within the crust or the lithospheric mantle is a function of the composition of the crust being buried, the thickness of the crust and the geotherm (Fig. 3\nA, Figs. S7 and S8). The thickness of primary mafic\u2013ultramafic crust is positively correlated with mantle temperature (Herzberg et al., 2010). Although the temperature of the upper mantle in the early Archaean is debated (Herzberg et al., 2010; Ganne and Feng, 2017), most estimates suggest mantle potential temperature was at least 150\u00b0C warmer than the present day, and that primary crustal thicknesses were 20\u201345 km (Herzberg et al., 2010). These results are consistent with the trace element composition of most TTG that formed by intracrustal melting of amphibolite in the stability field of garnet, requiring a crustal thickness of at least \u223c20\u201325 km assuming an average density of 2950 kg.m\u22123 (B\u00e9dard, 2006; Johnson et al., 2017). Phase equilibrium calculations suggest most TTG formed under crustal geotherms of 700\u00b0C.GPa\u22121 or higher (Johnson et al., 2017), consistent with the range of apparent geotherms estimated from the metamorphic rock record (600\u20131200\u00b0C.GPa\u22121) (Brown and Johnson, 2018).\nAssuming a minimum thickness of 20 km for early Archaean mafic\u2013ultramafic crust, typical Archaean hydrated metabasites would have undergone major dehydration within the crust for geotherms greater than around 800\u00b0C.GPa\u22121 (Fig. 3B). Importantly, at a crustal thickness of 20 km and for all plausible geotherms (<1100\u20131200\u00b0C.GPa\u22121), both high-MgO metabasites and ultrahigh-MgO metabasites would have undergone chlorite dehydration at depths below the Moho (Fig. 3B), leading to hydration and enrichment of the lithospheric mantle in fluid-mobile elements, and promoting partial melting of that source to produce enriched basalts.\nFor a crustal thickness of 30 km and geotherms >700\u00b0C.GPa\u22121, major pulses of intracrustal dehydration by breakdown of chlorite in metabasite and high-MgO metabasite, and of antigorite in ultrahigh-MgO metabasite, release H2O to hydrate overlying dry or H2O-undersaturated mafic rocks, making them more fertile to subsequent partial melting when buried to deeper crustal levels. If fluid produced by dehydration of less magnesium rocks in the mid crust was not highly channelised, adjacent ultramafic intrusions would potentially have become hydrated, and would have acted as a \u2018sponge\u2019, permitting transportation of H2O to much greater, rather than lesser, depths (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, chlorite dehydration in ultrahigh-MgO metabasite may still have occurred within the lithospheric mantle for a geotherm <900\u00b0C.GPa\u22121 (Fig. 3B). By contrast, for crust >40 km thick and plausible geotherms (>600\u00b0C.GPa\u22121), dehydration of all modelled lithologies would have occurred within the crust. Chlorite breakdown in ultrahigh-MgO metabasite occurs at temperatures above the H2O-saturated-solidi for Archaean metabasite and high-MgO metabasite (Fig. 3), but not above the solidi for strongly H2O-undersaturated intrusive equivalents.\nSubduction buries upper crustal rocks along cool geotherms (Peacock, 1990), providing an ideal mechanism for transporting fluids into the mantle. Indeed, many greenstone sequences throughout the Archaean eon contain enriched and hydrated \u2018boninite-like\u2019 magmas similar to those that characterise the initiation stages of modern subduction zones (Smithies et al., 2018), where strongly-depleted mantle is fluxed by trace-element enriched \u2018crustal\u2019 fluids. The occurrence of \u2018boninite-like\u2019 rocks in many greenstone belts could reflect partial melting of lithospheric mantle due to high-temperature dehydration of ultramafic rocks buried in \u2018warm\u2019 Archaean subduction zones (Fig. 4\nA). However, even more common in Archaean sequences are high-Mg basaltic rocks that preserve variolitic textures believed to reflect fluid-fluxed melting of lithospheric mantle (Murphy et al., 2021). In the eastern Pilbara Craton in Western Australia, these voluminous variolitic basalts are included among the oldest preserved volcanic rocks in the region (3.47 billion years old), and are argued to have formed in a stagnant-lid regime (Murphy et al., 2021). Numerical modelling has shown intraplate \u2018sagduction\u2019 processes are also able to bury hydrated upper crustal rocks to upper mantle depths along geotherms similar to those that characterise hot subduction zones (Sizova et al., 2015). Given the ability of hydrated mafic\u2013ultramafic volcanic rocks to transport volatiles to depth under geotherms >500\u00b0C.GPa\u22121 suggests that subduction-like environments may not have been required. Instead, these volatiles could have been transported into the mantle via sinking greenstone drips (Fig. 4B; B\u00e9dard, 2006; Johnson et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2021; Smithies et al., 2021).\n\n\n4\nImplications for the generation of TTG magmas\nThe presence of hydrous fluids lowers the melting temperature of metabasalt to 650\u2013700\u00b0C. Fluid-fluxed melting produces TTG melts with \u2018high-pressure\u2019 trace element signatures (high-Sr and low-HREE contents), in which the volume of melt produced is proportional to the volume of external fluid added until the melt becomes saturated in H2O (Pourteau et al., 2020). The presence of a significant fluid reservoir in the lower portions of Archaean primary mafic-ultramafic crust obviates the need for inverted thermal gradients to introduce fluids at temperatures conducive to partial melting (Clemens et al., 2020). Instead, the formation of significant volumes of TTG magma in the lower parts of primary Archaean crust may have been an inevitable consequence of magmatic thickening of variably hydrated ultramafic-rich crust along warm Archaean geotherms (e.g. Webb et al., 2020).\nModelling of the bulk Archaean crustal fluid budgets clearly shows that the dehydration and subsequent partial melting of primary mafic-ultramafic crust is sensitive to the proportion of hydrated ultramafic rock present (Fig. 3A). For ultramafic rock abundances of 30%, comparable to some komatiite-rich greenstone belts (de Wit and Ashwal, 1995) or greenstone belts with abundant MgO-rich boninite-like rocks and ultramafic intrusions such as Isua in West Greenland (Furnes et al., 2009; Szilas et al., 2015), the total fluid budget of Archaean crust is twice that of crust comprising only metabasite (Fig. 3A, Fig. S7 and S8). Importantly, in crust with 30% ultramafic rocks, >50% of this fluid is released at temperatures >700\u00b0C. For ultramafic rock contents of 5%, comparable to the average abundance of komatiite in greenstone belts (de Wit and Ashwal, 1995), the fluid carrying capacity of Archaean crust increases by 20% (Figs. S7 and S8), 17% of which is released at temperatures >700\u00b0C. In addition to hydration, silicification (metasomatism) during seafloor alteration of Archean primary crust was likely important in decreasing solidus temperatures and\/or increasing melt fertility (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2022), with each mole of quartz at the solidus yielding approximately 2 moles of melt upon heating to 850\u00b0C (Stuck and Diener, 2017). In regions dominated by cooler geothermal gradients, where fluids locked within the ultramafic component of Archaean crust were released within the lithospheric mantle, TTGs may have formed by a two-stage process. The release of fluids in the lithospheric mantle would have promoted partial melting and advection of enriched hydrous mafic magmas into the lower crust (Fig. 4), contributing additional heat and fluids to form the hybridised mafic source of TTG (Smithies et al., 2021).\nThese results therefore highlight that the differentiation of Earth's primary mafic\u2013ultramafic crust likely proceeded by a combination of processes, including both fluid-absent and fluid-present crustal anatexis, to produce TTG of variable compositions; where the extent of fluid-present melting, and the formation of seemingly \u2018high-pressure\u2019 (high Sr\/Y) TTG, was limited by the availability of free water supplied by hydrated lower crustal ultramafic material. Fluid-present melting models may not fully account for crustal differentiation throughout the Archaean, but should be more widely applicable to the earliest felsic Hadean-Eoarchaean proto-continents which are believed to have formed above regions of anomalously hot mantle via partial melting of primary mafic\u2013ultramafic crust that was subject to hydrothermal alteration (Reimink et al., 2014; Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019, 2022). Given the strong dependence of melt productivity with the volume of external fluid supplied to sustain fluid-present melting (Pourteau et al., 2020), an intriguing and counter-intuitive implication of our model is that the development of Earth's proto-continents in the early Archaean might reflect a primordial variability in the proportion of ultramafic rock (and water content) of Earth's primary mafic\u2013ultramafic crust.\nEvidence for these processes in the rock record may be preserved in the Lewisian Complex in NW Scotland, where amphibole-bearing metaperidotites and metapyroxenites are interlayered with garnet-bearing metabasic migmatites (Guice et al., 2018). These rocks show a close spatial and temporal association with garnet-biotite gneisses interpreted to be of (volcano) sedimentary origin (Johnson et al., 2016). The metaperidotites have a similar mineralogy to those predicted for hydrated komatiites metamorphosed to granulite facies (Fig. S4), and these lithological associations have been interpreted by some to represent an Archaean greenstone sequence that sunk into the lower crust (Johnson et al., 2016). Moreover, the greenstone sequence at Isua in West Greenland, preserves a range of mafic\u2013ultramafic rocks types, including metabasic rocks containing Mg-rich chlorite (Furnes et al., 2009) and amphibole-bearing olivine serpentinites (Szilas et al., 2015), both of which are indicative of hydrated ultramafic protoliths.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nThroughout the Archaean, Earth was covered in a global ocean (Bindeman et al., 2018), such that most or all mafic and ultramafic lavas were erupted under water. The recognition that hydrated ultramafic rocks dehydrate at elevated temperatures highlights a new geochemical pathway for recycling of volatiles into the deep crust and upper mantle on a hotter early Earth. Depending on local crustal composition and thickness, and the ambient conductive geotherm, high-temperature dehydration of ultramafic rocks such as, but not limited to, komatiite, would have caused hydration and\/or fluid-present melting of overlying lower MgO rock types, ultimately to form TTG magmas, the building blocks of ancient continental crust. Alternatively, if liberated at subcrustal depths, such fluids would have metasomatized the lithospheric mantle to form the source of enriched Archaean basalts.\n\n\n6\nMethods\nMethods and any associated references are available in the supplementary information provided.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nMichael I.H.

This paradigm aims to integrate disparate geoscientific data in order to formulate a model of lithospheric architecture and history that can be used to identify locations that were once conducive to deposit formation (e.g., McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014).\nMagnetotelluric (MT) imaging has emerged as a key tool in the mineral systems framework, particularly due to observed spatial relationships between lithosphere-scale electrical conductivity anomalies and iron oxide-apatite (IOA) and iron oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) deposits. The premier examples of such correlations have come from the Olympic Dam region (Heinson et al., 2006, 2018) and the Cloncurry District (Jiang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) in Australia as well as from the Southeast Missouri Iron Province (SMIP) in the United States (Fig. 1\n; e.g., McCafferty et al., 2019). At the mineral-province scale, MT imaging reveals highly conductive (\n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m), steeply dipping pipe- or sheet-like anomalies at mid-lower crustal depths as well as moderately conductive (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n S\/m) \u201cfingers\u201d that extend into the upper crust beneath individual deposits (e.g., Fig. 1).\nPresently intracratonic, Mesoproterozoic-aged IOA-IOCG deposits in the Olympic Dam region and in the SMIP are viewed as magmatic-hydrothermal in origin. Genetic models invoke mantle-derived magmatism in an extensional setting (back-arc, orogenic collapse, or intraplate rift) to provide heat and fluids, as well as possibly metals, into the system (e.g., Day et al., 2016; McCafferty et al., 2019; Skirrow et al., 2018; see also Fig. 1C); mixing of these magmatic fluids with near-surface fluids (meteoric waters or basinal brines) in the upper crust is inferred to have driven deposit formation (e.g., Barton, 2014; Schlegel et al., 2020). In this context, the co-located electrical conductivity anomalies have loosely been interpreted as the signature of metasomatism along crustal-scale magmatic fluid pathways (e.g., Heinson et al., 2018); however, a physically rigorous explanation of these apparently associated conductors is lacking. Here, we suggest that these conductivity anomalies are specifically the result of graphite precipitation from CO2-rich magmatic fluids. We propose a quantitative genetic model that links these crustal-scale anomalies to the formation of the IOA-IOCG deposits, and in doing so we underscore the value of MT imaging in the mineral systems framework.\n\n\n2\nConductivity mechanisms\nMost explanations for crustal electrical conductivity anomalies imply specific physicochemical conditions that do not match inferences for the Olympic Dam region and the SMIP. Here, we demonstrate that graphite is the only reasonable explanation, and indeed the best explanation, for the crustal-scale conductivity anomalies observed in these regions.\n\n2.1\nFree fluids\nAlthough often invoked in tectonically active domains, deep saline fluids are implausible in the ancient intracratonic settings in which these deposits are located. Fluids associated with original tectonomagmatism would have been consumed by retrograde hydration reactions on a time scale of \u223c10 Ma (e.g., Manning, 2018; Yardley and Valley, 1997; see also Yardley and Bodnar, 2014). As these regions have not experienced regional tectonism in >1 Ga, there is no modern source for deep fluid delivery into the mid-lower crust, and we consider it highly unlikely that meteoric fluids would percolate to such great depths under presumably lithostatic pressure gradients.\n\n\n2.2\nMetallic sulfides and oxides\nMetallic sulfides (e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite) are electrically conductive (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n S\/m; Keller, 1966); however, we discount such phases given the available geometric and tectonic constraints. Metasedimentary pyrite has been shown to be partly responsible for conductivity anomalies in paleo-subduction settings (Jones et al., 1997), but Olympic Dam and the SMIP are not located within suture zones. Subvertical, crustal-scale sulfide zones are problematic explanations in any other tectonic setting, as unreasonably large amounts (>10 wt%; Nelson and Van Voorhis, 1983) of intrusion-related sulfides throughout the mid-lower crust would be required to explain the observed anomalies. Although lower-crustal sulfide-rich intrusive bodies are recognized in the surface rock record (e.g., in the Ivrea Zone, northern Italy; Fiorentini et al., 2018), only locally within those intrusions does the sulfide content become high enough that a bulk conductivity anomaly (\n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m) would be expected (cf. Vukmanovic et al., 2019; Nelson and Van Voorhis, 1983). Therefore, we consider it highly unlikely that sulfides alone can explain the observed high conductivity values in the Olympic Dam region and in the SMIP.\nMetallic oxides (e.g., magnetite, ilmenite) are similarly electrically conductive (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n S\/m; Keller, 1966), and laboratory experiments indicate that they can become interconnected at moderate volume fractions (\u223c5%) to produce a bulk conductivity anomaly (Dai et al., 2019). However, these phases also often have very high magnetic susceptibilities (cf. Hunt et al., 1995). Conductive zones beneath the SMIP are associated with domains of low magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 1D), so such phases cannot be the cause of the observed high conductivity values.\nIn both of these cases, relatively high volume fractions (\n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n) of the conductive phase at spatial scales ranging from 10s of microns (Dai et al., 2019) to 10s of meters (Nelson and Van Voorhis, 1983) are needed to enhance bulk electrical conductivity. This requirement is due to the characteristic equant habit of metallic sulfides and oxides. Only at such high concentrations can these minerals form a texturally interconnected network that can produce a conductivity anomaly.\n\n\n2.3\nSilicate minerals\nElectrical conduction in silicate minerals is thermally activated, so these phases are incapable of producing a major electrical conductivity anomaly at the cold crustal temperatures in these stable Precambrian domains. Lower-crustal temperatures are <600\u00b0C at present in the SMIP (e.g., Schutt et al., 2018); at these temperatures, intrinsic semiconduction in potentially volumetrically significant silicates (e.g., feldspars, amphiboles, epidote) would produce bulk conductivity values \n<\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n S\/m (e.g., Hu et al., 2013, 2017, 2018). Extrinsic, volatile-mediated semiconduction in either micas (e.g., phlogopite) or nominally anhydrous minerals (e.g., feldspars, pyroxenes) would similarly only produce bulk conductivity values of \n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n S\/m at these cold temperatures (e.g., Yang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2017). Although lower-crustal temperatures in the Olympic Dam region may be somewhat higher than in the SMIP (e.g., Heinson et al., 2018), we nevertheless consider it unlikely that networks of volatile-bearing silicates can explain conductivity values \n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m within stable Precambrian crust, as such values would require temperatures \n>\n700\n\u2212\n800\n\n\u00b0C throughout the mid-lower crust.\n\n\n2.4\nGrain size reduction\nSilicate mineral grain size diminution within high-strain shear zones enhances electrical conductivity, as ionic transport is much more efficient along grain boundaries than within grain interiors, and grain boundaries dominate bulk behavior at small (<1 mm) grain sizes (e.g., Han et al., 2021; Pommier et al., 2018). However, the degree of conductivity enhancement depends upon temperature. Crustal conductivity values \n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m at grain sizes of \n1\n\u2212\n100\n \u03bcm (as would be expected for typical mid-lower crustal mylonitic shear zones; e.g., Okudaira et al., 2017; Waters-Tormey and Tikoff, 2007) generally require temperatures >800\u00b0C (e.g., Han et al., 2021), which is unreasonable for the Olympic Dam region and the SMIP (as discussed in Section 2.3).\n\n\n2.5\nGraphite\nGiven the above considerations, graphite is the only plausible cause of these conductivity anomalies, as this phase is highly conductive (\u223c106 S\/m; Keller, 1966) and can become readily interconnected at very small volume fractions due to its sheet-like habit (e.g., Glover, 1996) in order to produce a major bulk conductivity anomaly. Graphite has in fact been widely invoked in a range of settings to explain observed electrical conductivity anomalies (e.g., Evans, 2012; Glover and \u00c1d\u00e1m, 2008; Haak et al., 1997). For example, graphite is often used to explain crustal conductors in paleo-subduction settings, where biogenic carbon has been recrystallized to interconnected graphite in deformed metasedimentary rocks (e.g., Boerner et al., 1996). However, this genetic model is incompatible with tectonic inferences for the Olympic Dam region and the SMIP. Instead, we view graphite here as having precipitated from a CO2-rich magmatically derived fluid. Such an interpretation has been qualitatively discussed previously to various extents (e.g., Monteiro Santos et al., 2002; Selway, 2014), including in the context of mineral systems (e.g., Heinson et al., 2006; Wannamaker and Doerner, 2002); however, its importance as a signature of tectonomagmatism has not been widely appreciated, and a rigorous quantitative justification for this interpretation has been critically lacking.\nThere are several mechanisms by which graphite may precipitate from magmatic fluids. In cooling rocks that contain titanomagnetite, the oxyexsolution reaction 6Fe2TiO4 + CO2 = 2Fe3O4 + 6FeTiO3 + C (Frost et al., 1989), where the CO2 is derived from a magmatic fluid, is one possible means to form graphite. However, conductivity anomalies in the SMIP are spatially associated with domains of low magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 1D); this relationship suggests that there is little magnetite in the conductive zones that could have facilitated this reaction. Fluid-rock hydration reactions can also drive graphite precipitation (e.g., Rumble, 2014). Such reactions, however, are often self-limiting because the wall rock generally cannot serve as an infinite sink for water (e.g., Luque et al., 2014). Instead, we consider graphite precipitation via carbon saturation in a cooling CO2-rich fluid to be the most likely scenario, as this mechanism does not impose any petrologic requirements upon the system and as such reactions can facilitate the precipitation of large amounts of graphite (e.g., Huizenga, 2011). This mode of graphite deposition has been well studied (e.g., Huizenga, 2011; Luque et al., 2014; and references therein) and is in fact thought to be common in the crust (Rumble, 2014). Consequently, we consider hydrothermal graphite precipitation from a cooling CO2-rich magmatic fluid to in fact be a natural explanation for these conductivity anomalies.\n\n\n\n3\nModel for graphite precipitation\nIn our conceptual model (Fig. 2\n), graphite precipitates from migrating CO2-rich fluids that are carried into the crust by mantle-derived melts in an extensional setting. Although carbon could be scavenged from local metasedimentary rocks, we consider the mantle as the key quantifiable source for carbon, as genetic models for these IOA-IOCG deposits invoke mantle-derived melts to establish the magmatic-hydrothermal system (McCafferty et al., 2019; Skirrow et al., 2018) and as carbon isotopes from the SMIP support the input of mantle-derived carbon (Johnson et al., 2016). In our model, graphite largely precipitates at mid- to lower-crustal levels from fluids that are exsolved from stalled mafic melts; at upper-crustal levels, fluids derived from related, more evolved melts drive IOA-IOCG mineralization via mixing with near-surface fluids.\nIn order to evaluate whether our conceptual model can explain the MT observations, we calculate the amplitude of the electrical conductivity anomaly that would be produced given the available carbon budget and physicochemical constraints. We summarize the three main steps of this calculation below; additional details are provided in the Supplemental Materials.\n\n3.1\nCarbon budget\nFirst, we estimate the absolute amount of carbon that is mobilized from the mantle during magmatism. Estimates of carbon content in the upper mantle are \n\u223c\n30\n\u2212\n1000\n ppmw C (e.g., Lee et al., 2019); we conservatively assume an average content of 30 ppmw C. Because CO2 is highly incompatible, we make a simplifying assumption that this full amount of C will be removed from the mantle, regardless of the degree of partial melting (e.g., Moore and Bodnar, 2019). Geodynamic modeling studies suggest an \n\u223c\n1000\n\u2212\n4000\n km3 mantle source volume per kilometer of rift length (e.g., Schmeling, 2010). Taking the lower bound, we estimate that \n8.24\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n12\n\n\n mol C is mobilized per kilometer along the axis of extension during mantle melting. We further conservatively assume that 10% of this available C (\n8.24\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n mol C) will be released into the mid-lower crust via expulsion from stalled melts, while the remainder is transported with melt into near-surface volcanic systems.\n\n\n3.2\nGraphite precipitation\nNext, we calculate the relative amount of carbon that would precipitate from the magmatic fluid under changing pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions. We model this fluid with the system C-O-H. Although the exsolved magmatic fluid would likely be saline, immiscibility at high P\/T yields two separate fluids, a CO2-rich fluid and a hypersaline brine, that would evolve separately (e.g., Manning, 2018; Yardley and Bodnar, 2014). The C-O-H fluid is therefore a useful approximation for our purposes here. We use the GFluid spreadsheet (Zhang and Duan, 2010), modified to use the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) oxygen fugacity (\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n) buffer of Ballhaus et al. (1991), to calculate the maximum relative amount of C at saturation (i.e., fluid C activity is unity) that can be retained in the fluid as a function of P\/T. In these calculations, we assume that the wall rock serves as a sink for O2 so that the fluid is held at constant \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n during graphite precipitation. (If O2 instead remains in the fluid, then fluid \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n will increase during graphite precipitation, and the net graphite precipitation potential will then be less than with constant fluid \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n; Huizenga, 2011. However, the wall rock is expected to buffer the fluid to constant \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n; Selverstone, 2005.)\nThe results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 3\n. In these plots, the fractional difference between any two points gives the relative amount of C that is precipitated out of (or dissolved into) the fluid under changing P\/T conditions. The fluid becomes saturated in C with decreasing T and will then precipitate graphite, which leads to the C decrease in the fluid shown in these plots. We assume a hypothetical P\/T path (arrow in Fig. 3) representing fluid migration out of the lower crust to higher crustal levels, with the fluid cooling along an approximate average crustal geotherm during tectonomagmatism. (Although magmatic intrusions will modulate the crustal thermal field, we expect that this path will generally capture the average P\/T changes experienced during fluid flow. Furthermore, although migrating fluids will advect heat to some extent, they generally shed much of that heat to reach thermal equilibrium with the rocks through which they pass; e.g., Ague, 2014.) We further assume that the mantle source region sets fluid \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n to \u223cFMQ; this value is reasonable for the upper mantle, even in subduction-modified settings (Frost and McCammon, 2008). Igneous zircon-hosted iron oxide inclusions from the SMIP also provide supporting evidence that redox conditions of ore-stage magmas were near FMQ (Watts and Mercer, 2020). (The IOA-IOCG deposits themselves are more oxidized due, at least in part, to fluid mixing.) For this assumed P\/T path, 96% of the C in the magmatic fluid is precipitated as graphite.\n\n\n3.3\nResulting conductivity anomaly\nFinally, we evaluate the magnitude of the conductivity anomaly that would be produced by graphite precipitation from the magmatic fluid. Combining our absolute C budget estimate (Section 3.1) with our calculated relative amount of C precipitated along the assumed P\/T path (Section 3.2), we conclude that \n7.89\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n mol C is precipitated as graphite during magmatic fluid migration. We assume that the graphite is distributed over an area of 100 km across the axis of extension (based on the region of maximum surface deformation during extension from geodynamic modeling studies; e.g., Schmeling, 2010) by 10 km in depth (reflecting the arrow in Fig. 3), per kilometer along the axis of extension. This would produce a bulk graphite volume fraction of \n4.16\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n. Although the precipitated graphite would likely be concentrated along discrete permeable fluid pathways (either tectonically controlled or created by fluid overpressurization), this value reflects an overall bulk-average volume fraction across this model domain. In order to evaluate the expected magnitude of the resulting electrical conductivity anomaly, we then compare this value to various two-component mixing laws between electrically resistive rock-forming silicate minerals and electrically conductive graphite in Fig. 4\n.\nThe key curves in Fig. 4 are the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds, which provide the most general upper and lower limits on the bulk electrical conductivity of a two-component mixture (Hashin and Shtrikman, 1962; see also Schmeling, 1986). The upper conductivity bound reflects a system in which the more conductive phase (in this case, graphite) is texturally well connected, whereas the lower conductivity bound reflects a geometry in which the more conductive phase is poorly connected. The other mixing laws shown in Fig. 4 reflect specific textural geometries of the two phases, with curves plotting near the upper HS conductivity bound reflecting geometries in which the more conductive phase is generally interconnected. In comparing our calculated volume fraction to these mixing laws, the degree of textural interconnection is the crucial factor that dictates whether such small amounts of graphite will enhance bulk electrical conductivity. As Fig. 4 demonstrates, if the precipitated graphite in our model is indeed well connected, such that it is characterized by the upper conductivity bound, then our calculated bulk-average graphite volume fraction of \n4.16\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n (and even bulk volume fractions an order of magnitude less than this value) will produce a conductivity anomaly comparable to what is observed beneath these IOA-IOCG deposits (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n S\/m).\nThe graphite will indeed likely be well connected when precipitated from a mobile fluid along permeable pathways. Although CO2-rich fluids themselves are not expected to be readily mobile due to poor grain-boundary wetting (e.g., Manning, 2018), their mobility will be greatly enhanced by the additional presence of saline fluids (e.g., Newton and Tsunogae, 2014; Touret et al., 2019) that are common in magmatic systems (e.g., Pirajno, 2021; Yardley and Bodnar, 2014). Therefore, the related exsolved magmatic saline fluid in our model that results from fluid immiscibility (see Section 3.2) will promote mobility of the CO2-rich fluid and, consequently, interconnection of the precipitated graphite. (Regardless of the coexistence of saline fluids, observations of passive CO2 degassing in extensional settings indicates that such CO2-rich fluids are nevertheless mobile via some mechanism through the crust; Tamburello et al., 2018.) Syngenetic shearing of tectonically controlled fluid pathways could act to further promote interconnection (e.g., J\u00f6dicke et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nImplications for regional mineral exploration\nOur purposefully conservative calculations here validate the inference that electrical conductivity anomalies, in the correct tectonic setting, may demarcate zones of crustal-scale magmatic fluid flow. However, there are many ways to produce a conductivity anomaly (as discussed in Section 2), and not all anomalies will be linked to ore mineralization. Complementary geological, geochemical, and geophysical observations are needed to determine whether hydrothermal graphite precipitation may be a reasonable interpretation for a given feature in an MT image that could then provide a link to a prospective magmatic or magmatic-hydrothermal mineral system.\nIt is crucial to note that these conductors are specifically associated with the roots of a potential mineral system in our model and therefore may be only indirectly related to ore mineralization. Although CO2-rich fluids may play a key role in transporting metals from the mantle into the crust (Blanks et al., 2020) and may be important in producing alteration patterns within IOA-IOCG deposits (e.g., Pirajno, 2021), we lack direct evidence that can link the deep CO2-rich fluids in our model to ore-forming processes operating at higher crustal levels. Consequently, the fluids that precipitate graphite in our model are not necessarily the same fluids that carry metals into the mineral system. Indeed, the magmatic fluids that precipitate graphite are almost certainly not directly the same as those that drive ore mineralization; formation of mineral deposits at upper crustal depths is likely the result of mixing between more evolved magmatic fluids, derived from more evolved melts, and near-surface fluids (Fig. 2; Barton, 2014; Schlegel et al., 2020). Consequently, in our model, graphite precipitation and mineral deposit formation are two independent components of a single mineral system. When combined with other datasets to constrain tectonic setting, MT-imaged conductivity anomalies may then be indicative of a paleo-tectonomagmatic system that could have driven ore mineralization at upper crustal levels.\nFurthermore, as graphite precipitation and mineral deposit formation occur in disparate crustal intervals within the overall mineral system, there should be no expectation that the graphite that causes these mid-lower crustal conductivity anomalies will be significantly exposed in the upper crust, at the deposit or even regional district scale. Although this mismatch in crustal levels presents a challenge in validating our model, examination of exposed lower crustal sections may provide valuable insights in assessing the role of hydrothermal graphite precipitation in mineral systems (see Section 4.4).\n\n\n4.2\nRedox requirements and implications\nAlthough we have purposefully made conservative estimates in our C budget calculations, our results are dependent upon the redox conditions of the magmatic fluid. The C mol% isopleths in Fig. 3 change significantly when moving away from the FMQ buffer. The distribution of these isopleths determines both the depth at which graphite will precipitate from the fluid (based on P\/T conditions through the crust) and how much cooling is required to precipitate a fixed amount of graphite (more reduced conditions require more cooling for the same C precipitation). However, if the fluid \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n were to deviate significantly from FMQ, even precipitating just 3% of the available C (1 mol% of fluid C) still results in a significant bulk conductivity anomaly (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m, compared to \n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n S\/m crystalline crustal background; Fig. 4), as long as the graphite is texturally interconnected. (Similarly, if fluid \n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n were to increase during graphite precipitation due to violation of our assumptions in Section 3.2, an order of magnitude less graphite would still yield a bulk conductivity anomaly comparable to what is observed in Fig. 1.)\nThe highest amplitude portions of the observed anomalies beneath Olympic Dam and in the SMIP generally appear to be restricted to a certain depth range (e.g., Fig. 1; Heinson et al., 2018). Although it has been suggested that the tops of these conductors reflect the brittle-ductile transition at the time of mineral system formation (e.g., Heinson et al., 2018), we consider it more likely that this pattern reflects the spatial location of P\/T conditions that were most conducive for graphite precipitation from the magmatic fluid\u2014i.e., in Fig. 3, the P\/T field over which the fluid C content drops rapidly from \u223c30 to \u223c1 mol%. If the redox conditions of the magmatic fluid can be estimated, then the depth range of these conductors may provide constraints on paleo P\/T conditions during fluid flow with implications for mineral exploration efforts. Alternatively, if paleo P\/T conditions can be independently constrained, then the depth extent of these features may provide insights into magmatic redox conditions.\n\n\n4.3\nGraphite volume fractions and the scale of interconnection\nIn order to produce a bulk electrical conductivity anomaly comparable to observations, the small (\n4.16\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n) bulk-average volume fraction of graphite that we calculate here must be interconnected across our model domain. Laboratory experiments indicate that graphite volume fractions as high as \n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n are insufficient to enhance bulk electrical conductivity due to poor interconnection of the conductive phase (e.g., Hashim et al., 2013; J\u00f6dicke et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013; Zhang and Yoshino, 2017). However, such experiments have often focused on biogenic carbon in metasedimentary rocks and graphite in synthetic crystal aggregates; few laboratory observations have been made specifically on rocks containing fluid-precipitated graphite. Where laboratory experiments indicate low electrical conductivity (\n<\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n S\/m) for rocks that do contain hydrothermal graphite, the low values are suggested to be an artifact due to disruption of the graphite electrical connection during rock exhumation (e.g., Katsube and Mareschal, 1993). Laboratory observations of increasing electrical conductivity with increasing pressure in metamorphic rocks containing small amounts (\n<\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n volume fraction) of fluid-precipitated graphite (Mathez et al., 1995; Shankland et al., 1997) suggest that small volume fractions of this conductive phase can indeed contribute to enhanced electrical conductivity under realistic crustal physicochemical conditions.\nA key complication in comparing laboratory experiments to geophysical imaging results, however, is the intrinsic mismatch between observation scales. Laboratory experiments at the hand-sample scale (\u223c10s of cm) struggle to capture the bulk crustal properties that would be expected when averaging over the large scales (\u223c10s of m to several km) at which geophysical imaging techniques such as MT aggregate information (e.g., Bahr, 1997). For example, in the MT images of the SMIP shown in Fig. 1, the nominal horizontal cell size in the inversion is 2.5 km by 2.5 km (see the Supplemental Materials). In this case, electrical conductivity information is inherently bulk averaged over that length scale (at a minimum; regularization, survey design, and variable electromagnetic diffusion further increase this averaging length scale). Consequently, within such large averaging volumes, the actual distribution of graphite is unconstrained. Fig. 5\n demonstrates the equivalence between homogeneously low and heterogeneously high graphite concentrations to yield the same observed bulk electrical conductivity value within a given averaging volume. For example, the same bulk-average electrical conductivity (\n\u223c\n2.7\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n S\/m) would arise for either the entire averaging volume containing a graphite volume fraction of 4.16\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n or for a fraction of \n4.16\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n of the total averaging volume containing veins of pure (volume fraction 100) graphite (these are endmembers of the thick dotted line in Fig. 5). Near-surface electrical observations of the spatial distribution of graphite in exposed mid-lower crustal rocks in Norway (Engvik et al., 2021) and Sri Lanka (Wickramasinghe et al., 2018) confirm that zones of graphite enrichment (\n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n volume fraction, with electrical conductivity \n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n S\/m) are highly heterogeneously distributed, but variably laterally connected, at the scale of 100s of meters to 10s of kilometers.\nIn our model, we envision graphite deposition occurring along discrete permeable fluid-flow pathways. Sections of the crust along these pathways would then be enriched in graphite compared to our calculated overall bulk-average graphite volume fraction (likely by orders of magnitude), whereas sections of the crust outside of these pathways would be largely devoid of graphite. Large-scale electrical interconnection of discrete, graphite-enriched permeable pathways would likely be characterized by the upper HS conductivity bound, as we expect these pathways to be texturally well connected at large scales given that they facilitate fluid flow. Consequently, despite the aforementioned ambiguities in laboratory observations, we consider it likely that the small overall bulk-average volume fraction of fluid-precipitated graphite that we calculate in Section 3.3 will texturally be characterized by the upper HS conductivity bound at the large scales at which geophysical observations aggregate information. We then expect the resulting bulk-average conductivity values to match MT observations.\n\n\n4.4\nPotential analogs in the surface rock record\nAlong the permeable fluid pathways in our model, we envision graphite precipitating either as grain-boundary films or in a crustal-scale network of graphite veins. Grain-boundary graphite films have long been recognized in mid-lower crustal rocks (e.g., Frost et al., 1989; Mareschal et al., 1992); however, laboratory experiments are inconsistent in demonstrating the effects of such films in enhancing bulk electrical conductivity. Older laboratory experiments have provided evidence that graphite films do enhance bulk conductivity to some extent when held at mid-crustal pressures that would keep graphite networks interconnected (Mathez et al., 1995; Shankland et al., 1997), and experiments with vapor-deposited graphite films similarly support an enhancement of conductivity at low volume fractions (Roberts et al., 1999). However, newer laboratory experiments indicate that thin (<1 \u03bcm) graphite films are unstable at high temperatures (>700\u00b0C; Yoshino and Noritake, 2011) and over long time scales (>10s of ka). Given these competing laboratory results, we conclude that cooling and crustal \u201cfossilization\u201d could promote the stability of thicker (>1 \u03bcm) grain-boundary films, and the persistence of an associated conductivity anomaly, over long geologic time scales. Because there is no evidence for major post-ore tectonomagmatism in either the Olympic Dam region or the SMIP, and because mid-lower crustal temperatures in these regions are generally <700\u00b0C at present (see Section 2.3), we consider grain-boundary films to be a feasible textural model for the occurrence of graphite in these domains, particularly within ancient fluid-flow pathways where thick (>1 \u03bcm) grain-boundary films would be expected.\nHowever, we consider it more likely that the graphite in these regions occurs within interconnected vein networks, as this mode of occurrence is widely recognized in the rock record (e.g., Luque et al., 2014). In particular, the Sri Lankan vein graphite deposits (e.g., Touret et al., 2019) may provide an analog for what lies beneath the Olympic Dam region and the SMIP. The Sri Lankan graphite is inferred to have formed from mantle-derived carbon-rich fluids, similar to what we envision here within these mineral systems. The Sri Lankan deposits contain large volumes of graphitic carbon; based on local geologic mapping (Erdosh, 1970) and near-surface electrical observations (Wickramasinghe et al., 2018), volumetric ratios of graphite to country rock are \n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n in the vicinity of vein deposits, roughly two orders of magnitude greater than the volume fraction we calculate in our model. However, graphite veins are irregularly distributed along the \u223c500 km corridor in which they are found in Sri Lanka (e.g., Touret et al., 2019). When averaged over larger areas, the bulk volume fraction of graphite may be comparable to that predicted by our model, particularly given the conservative assumptions underlying our calculations. Given these considerations, we view the Sri Lankan graphite veins as a promising analog for the occurrence of graphite beneath Olympic Dam and the SMIP.\nAlthough our calculations in Section 3 apply most directly to high conductivity anomalies in the mid-lower crust, observed moderately conductive \u201cfingers\u201d in the upper crust (e.g., Fig. 1; Heinson et al., 2018) can perhaps also be explained by hydrothermal graphite precipitation. The Borrowdale graphite deposit in the U.K. (e.g., Luque et al., 2014) may be a reasonable analog for these conductive features. At Borrowdale, upper-crustal magmas assimilated large volumes of crustal carbon. Magmatic exsolution and consequent overpressurization of carbon-rich fluids, with redox conditions at or just above the FMQ buffer, caused brecciation of the host rock; graphite was then precipitated from these fluids during pervasive wall-rock hydration reactions. Although there is no evidence for the magmatic remobilization of crustal carbon in either the Olympic Dam region or the SMIP, evolved upper-crustal magmatic fluids in these regions could have still carried enough mantle-derived carbon at the appropriate redox conditions to precipitate graphite via hydration reactions at shallow depths (i.e., during propylitic alteration of the country rock immediately below the IOA-IOCG deposits) and to thereby yield a moderate conductivity (\n\u223c\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n2\n\n\n S\/m) anomaly at such depths. These upper-crustal \u201cfingers\u201d may be further enhanced or alternatively explained by sulfide vein mineralization or hydrothermal clays associated with wall-rock alteration (e.g., Delayre et al., 2020).\n\n\n4.5\nApplication to other mineral systems\nThe viability of using electrically conductive hydrothermal graphite to identify the roots of magmatic-hydrothermal mineral systems more broadly will be dictated by the redox requirements for graphite precipitation. Although graphite will readily precipitate from a fluid with redox conditions near (within one log unit of) or below the FMQ buffer, graphite is not expected to precipitate from a fluid at more than two log units above the FMQ buffer (e.g., Huizenga, 2011). Consequently, hydrothermal graphite precipitation is unlikely in porphyry copper systems, as the magmas and associated mid-lower crustal magmatic fluids are generally highly oxidized with respect to FMQ (e.g., Lee and Tang, 2020). Hydrothermal graphite will likely only be present in mineral systems characterized by magmatic redox conditions near FMQ.\nSimilarly, our model may not apply to all IOA-IOCG systems, as such deposits form through many different mechanisms in a range of tectonic settings (e.g., Barton, 2014; Schlegel et al., 2020). Not all IOA-IOCG formation mechanisms involve the mobilization of deep CO2-rich fluids that could precipitate graphite, and other conductivity mechanisms (cf. Section 2) may explain observations, depending on tectonic setting. For example, a major conductivity anomaly is observed beneath the Ernest Henry IOCG deposit in the Cloncurry District, Australia (Jiang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). That deposit likely formed, at least partially, in an orogenic setting (e.g., Barton, 2014), so underthrust conductive metasedimentary units (e.g., Boerner et al., 1996; Jones et al., 1997) may provide an alternative explanation for the observed anomaly.\nAlthough we have specifically argued for mantle-derived carbon in our model, it is nevertheless possible that remobilization and reprecipitation of crustal carbon through mechanisms similar to those that we have argued for here (e.g., Luque et al., 2014) may also produce a regional-scale conductivity anomaly. Magmatic assimilation of carbonaceous material and subsequent exsolution of carbon-rich fluids may ultimately drive hydrothermal graphite precipitation that could yield a conductivity anomaly within a mineral system. Additionally, because crustal carbon can act as a reducing agent during magmatic assimilation, hydrothermal graphite precipitation from fluids associated with such hybridized magmas may be a useful geophysical tracer for studying systems in which magmatic redox processes are key for mineral system evolution (e.g., in certain reduced gold systems, such as gold porphyries and possibly Carlin-type\/-like systems; Johnson et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe have quantitatively demonstrated that graphite precipitation from CO2-rich magmatically derived fluids is the best explanation for the crustal-scale electrical conductivity anomalies observed beneath the Olympic Dam region and the SMIP. Furthermore, hydrothermal graphite is a natural explanation for these anomalies, as graphite will readily precipitate from carbon-bearing fluids throughout the crustal column either via cooling or via hydration reactions, under reasonable fluid redox constraints. The physicochemical principles upon which our model is based can consequently be readily extended to other magmatic-hydrothermal mineral systems, provided that there is a source of carbon (either from the mantle or from the crust) and that the magmatic fluid redox conditions are appropriate for graphite precipitation. Hydrothermal graphite may then be a useful electrically conductive indicator of ancient crustal-scale fluid flow and a valuable crustal-scale vector in exploring for magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nBenjamin S.

It has been shown that over glacial cycles the physical and chemical properties of water bodies, water levels, and the catchment areas and sediment supply can vary greatly (Thunell and Williams, 1989; Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005; Grant et al., 2012; Torfstein et al., 2013; Lazar et al., 2014). This raises the question of whether long-term climate changes can affect the magnitude\/frequency of sediment density flows entering a specific water body, and if so what controls the variability.\nOne possible approach to explore these questions is by investigating a comprehensive geological record from past glacial cycles from a specific water body. However, the links between modern sediment density flows and resulting deposits in long-term geological records are poorly understood and have rarely been investigated so far (Piper and Savoye, 1993; Maier et al., 2019). This is because it is rare that both comprehensive long-term geological records (with ages well-constrained and sediment facies intensively investigated) and modern flow monitoring data are available for a specific water body.\nThe Dead Sea is the largest and deepest hypersaline lake (\u03c1\nwater: 1240 kg\/m3) on Earth. Floods and turbid water have been monitored here (Levy, 1981; Stiller et al., 1997; Herut et al., 2002; Nehorai et al., 2013), meaning these and related subaqueous sediment density flow processes are relatively well-understood. In addition, paleoenvironments in the region have been intensively investigated (Bar-Matthews et al., 2003; Torfstein et al., 2013; Miebach et al., 2019). ICDP (International Continental Drilling Program) Core 5017-1 from the hypersaline lake depocenter provides a geological record covering marine oxygen isotope stage 7-1 (MIS 7-1; 220-0 ka) (Torfstein et al., 2015; Goldstein et al., 2020). The combination of the well-constrained regional paleoenvironment around the lake and the completeness of ICDP Core 5017-1 make this record ideal for: (1) understanding the links between modern sediment density flow processes and ancient deposits; (2) detecting whether the magnitude and\/or frequency of the flows are stable or not through glacial cycles; and (3) if not, revealing how the changing environment has affected the magnitude\/frequency of the flows.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting and hypothesis\n\n2.1\nGeography of the Dead Sea\nThe Dead Sea Basin, the largest pull-apart basin along the Dead Sea Transform (Fig. 1\na), has been occupied by a sequence of terminal water bodies during the Quaternary such as the Dead Sea (MIS 1) and Lake Lisan (MIS 4-2) (Stein, 2001). Lake Lisan, which existed during the Last Glacial Maximum, is the largest known lacustrine system (Fig. 1a), had a lake level at 180 m below mean sea-level (\u2212180 m) and a surface area of \u223c3200 km2 (Hall, 1997; Torfstein et al., 2013). The Dead Sea currently has a water level at \u2212435 m and a surface area of \u223c600 km2.\nClimate zones in the drainage area range from Mediterranean to hyperarid, and fluctuate dramatically through glacial cycles (Bar-Matthews et al., 2003; Miebach et al., 2019). The region is characterized by a relatively dry climate during the Holocene and a humid climate during the Last Glacial. Consequently, the Holocene Dead Sea is at low-stand with higher salinity in contrast to high-stand conditions with lower salinity during the Last Glacial (Torfstein et al., 2013; Lazar et al., 2014). The current Dead Sea water has a salinity of 340 \u2030 (240 kg\/m3) (\u223c9 times greater than seawater) and a density of 1240 kg\/m3 (Arnon et al., 2019). By comparison, the salinity and density of central-southern Lake Lisan water are estimated to be 70-130\u2030 (50-100 kg\/m3) and 1050-1100 kg\/m3, respectively (Begin et al., 2004; Lazar et al., 2014). Thermohaline stratification is observed in the Dead Sea during summer but disappears during winter (Arnon et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2\nFlash flood and surface plume monitoring\nFlash floods play a key role in sediment delivery and Dead Sea basin filling. Due to the sparse vegetative cover in the lake catchment, suspended sediment concentrations of flash floods in the region are extremely high (Cohen and Laronne, 2005). Suspended sediment concentrations of floods that occurred during the rainy season (winter) of 1997 and 2000 were measured near to river mouth of the Nahal Qanna'im-Rahaf (Fig. 1b). Among the seven measurements, one flood had a maximum sediment concentration of 270 kg\/m3; another three floods had maximum sediment concentrations >50 kg\/m3 (Cohen and Laronne, 2005).\nFlood plumes are common in the lake during the rainy season and can reach the lake center (Fig. 1c-d). Surface water measurements near to the river mouths of Jordan River and the Nahal Qidron (Fig. 1b) after floods have revealed suspended particle concentrations decrease with distance offshore (Levy, 1981; Herut et al., 2002). Surface reflectance mapping of the entire Dead Sea through remote sensing applications following floods revealed that sediment concentrations are typically high along the shore and decrease with distance from shore (Fig. 1d) (Nehorai et al., 2013).\n\n\n2.3\nICDP Core 5017-1 and previous lithofacies studies\nThe 457 m-long ICDP Core 5017-1 was drilled from the Dead Sea depocenter (31\u00b030\u203229\u2033 N, 35\u00b028\u203216\u2033 E) under a water depth of 297.5 m (lake level: \u2212424 m) during 2010-2011. A hydraulic piston coring tool was used to recover the upper 30 meters of the core, while the deeper sections were cored by using the rotating extended-nose bit coring system (Stein et al., 2011). The recovery rate is about 90% (Neugebauer et al., 2014). The sedimentary sequence covers the past 220 kyr and its age model is built on a combination of 14C (Kitagawa et al., 2017) and U-Th (Torfstein et al., 2015) dating, and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO stratigraphy correlation (Goldstein et al., 2020). The recovered sequence comprises seven basic facies which can be classified into four groups, (I) evaporites and related facies: halite, gypsum, and aragonite-detritus laminae (including in situ deformed ones) (Fig. 2\n), (II) slump facies (Fig. 2), (III) debrite facies (Figs. 2, 3\n) and graded turbidite facies (Figs. 2, 3), and (IV) homogeneous mud (Fig. 3).\nHalite and gypsum deposits in the core imply a negative water balance, increasing salinity, and thus indicating a relatively arid climate (Torfstein et al., 2015; Kiro et al., 2016). The aragonite-detritus laminae couplet reflects the input of runoff freshwater and a relatively humid climate (Lu et al., 2017a, 2020a; Ben Dor et al., 2018). Furthermore, units of in situ deformed aragonite-detritus laminae indicate seismic activity along the central Dead Sea Fault (Lu et al., 2020b).\nSlumps are characterized by intensely folded and fragmented aragonite-detritus laminae without gravel or coarse sands (Fig. 2m). The debrites comprise two sub-types (I) cohesive muddy debrites (Fig. 2n), and (II) poorly-cohesive clean sandy debrites (Fig. 3d-g). Type I debrites are muds that contain gravel, intraclasts, and coarse sands that show poorly-sorted chaotic structures, which were previously named chaotic deposits (Lu et al., 2017a). Slumps and Type I debrites (chaotic deposits) have been identified as seismically-triggered deposits by temporal correlation with previously established earthquake records on the Dead Sea Margin (Lu et al., 2017a).\nHomogeneous mud facies are characterized by massive clay-fine silts without aragonite lamina (pelagic sediments) or particle grading. Thousands of graded sandy and muddy turbidites are observed in the core. Some of them are overlying in situ seismites without intervening background sediments, and some are temporally correlated with historic earthquakes, and thus identified as seismogenic turbidites (Lu et al., 2021a). However, for the rest of the turbidites, all homogeneous muds, and clean sandy debrites, the trigger(s) is unclear. Here, we focus on these three types of deposits with unclear triggers, analyze their thickness and frequency, and compare them to climate proxies.\n\n\n2.4\nHypothesis\nClimate in the Dead Sea area has changed substantially over glacial cycles. The lake was in a low-stand phase (\n<\n\u2212\n380 m) with higher salinity (\u223c300\u2030 or \u223c200 kg\/m3) and water density (\u223c1200 kg\/m3) during the Holocene. In contrast, it was in a high-stand condition (>-300 m), with lower salinity (70-130\u2030 or 50-100 kg\/m3) and water density (1050-1100 kg\/m3) during the Last Glacial (Begin et al., 2004; Lazar et al., 2014; Torfstein, 2019). In oceanic environments (salinity: \u223c35\u2030 or 35 kg\/m3, \u03c1\nseawater: \u223c1025 kg\/m3), sediment concentrations of \u223c40 kg\/m3 are required for river plumes to trigger turbidity currents at the river mouth directly (hyperpycnal plunging) (Mulder and Syvitski, 1995). Based on the threshold of 40 kg\/m3 assumed for oceanic environments, the threshold of sediment concentration of \u223c200 kg\/m3 and \u223c50-100 kg\/m3 are inferred for the Holocene and Last Glacial, respectively in the Dead Sea. It is therefore expected that overflows (\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nflow\n\n\n<\n\u03c1\n\nwater) are more prominent during interglacials than in glacials, while underflows (\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nflow\n\n\n>\n\u03c1\n\nwater) are more prominent during glacials. This paper will test this hypothesis by analyzing overflow and underflow sedimentation preserved in the high-resolution ICDP Core 5017-1 from the Dead Sea depocenter.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nMagnetic susceptibility and XRF scanning\nA Multi-Sensor Core Logger with a Bartington MS2E sensor was used for magnetic susceptibility logging at 1 mm resolution. Element data at 1 mm resolution was obtained by ITRAX XRF scanning (equipped with a line-scan camera at GFZ Potsdam) using a Chromium tube at 30 kV voltage, 30 mA current, and exposure time of 1 s (Neugebauer et al., 2014). The high-resolution core images were also obtained during the non-destructive analyses. The abundance of titanium (Ti) and calcium (Ca) in the core have been used as proxies for clastic input and carbonate and gypsum, respectively (Lu et al., 2021a, 2021b). Here, we also use trends in these proxies to investigate sediment facies. Chloride (Cl) abundance was also used to indicate the relative variation of salinity since it can be linked to variability in halite content at orbital scales in the Dead Sea (Lazar et al., 2014). To counter the effects of grain size, water content, etc. and get a more reliable geochemical picture, we apply the method of centered-log ratios (CLR) to calibrate the intensity of Ti and Ca. The reliably measured elements of K, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cl, Ar, Br, and Sr are selected for geomean calculation and centered-log ratios transformation (Weltje et al., 2015). The method is not applicable to core intervals of halite and gypsum since the content of Ti is around 0 (Fig. 2a-c).\n\n\n3.2\nGrain size\nSeveral representative intervals of homogeneous muds and graded turbidites from the core were chosen for grain size measurement at 1 cm intervals. The total organic carbon content of homogeneous mud layers and turbidites from the ICDP Core 5017-1 is generally between 0.3% and 1% (Neugebauer et al., 2016). Samples are pre-treated with H2O2 to remove organic matter (Konert and Vandenberghe, 1997; Lu et al., 2018), but without dissolution of carbonate minerals because remobilized calcite particles are common in the lake. The measurements were taken by using a Beckman-Coulter LS 230 laser particle sizer in the Environmental Sedimentology Lab at the University of Haifa.\n\n\n3.3\nAge calculation for sediment layers\nWe have noted that normally used event-free age modeling method is not feasible. This is because meter-thick energetic slumps and debrites are common in ICDP Core 5017-1. It is impossible to estimate the amount of eroded originally accumulated sediments at the drilling site (Lu et al., 2017a, 2021a). Thus, we apply linear interpolation to the age calculation of sediment layers between dated horizons. By using 14C (Kitagawa et al., 2017), U-Th (Torfstein et al., 2015), and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO stratigraphy correlation (Goldstein et al., 2020) methods, more than 50 dated horizons in the ICDP Core 5017-1 are available for age interpolation during the past 220 kyrs. The dated horizons have been previously summarized in Lu et al. (2020b) (Table S1).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nCharacteristics of homogeneous muds, graded turbidites, and debrites (triggers unclear)\nThe different deposits are identified through their grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and chemical features. The units of homogeneous mud are composed of clay-fine silts (mean grain size <16 \u03bcm) without graded bedding. They show only relatively small variations in grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Ti and Ca (Fig. 3a, h, i). In contrast, the lower parts of graded turbidites are made up of coarse silts to fine sands and exhibit upward-fining particle sizes, increasing magnetic susceptibility and Ti, and large variations in Ca from bottom to top (Fig. 3a-c).\nThick intervals of homogeneous mud that exhibit sharp changes in magnetic susceptibility, Ti and Ca were interpreted as multiple sediment layers deposited in short succession, i.e. there was insufficient time between floods to deposit an identifiable thickness of the pelagic sediments (Fig. 4\nh-i). Low content of Ti and Ca, and small values in magnetic susceptibility characterize debrites that are composed of coarse sands and are predominantly ungraded (Fig. 3d-g). In total, we identify 3241 units of homogeneous mud, 1761 graded turbidites, and 39 debrites both with unclear triggers in the 457 m-long core.\n\n\n4.2\nSeparating the unit of homogeneous mud from turbidite tail (TE)\nDuring interglacials, some graded turbidites are overlaid by thick homogeneous mud (Fig. 3a, i, j; Fig. 4). Typical units of homogeneous mud in the ICDP Core 5017-1 have only minor variations in grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Ti and Ca. In contrast, a gradual decrease or increase in grain size, magnetic susceptibility, Ti and Ca from graded bedding (TA-TD) to tail (TE) of turbidites are expected. These key features are used to separate the unit of homogeneous mud from turbidite tail (Fig. 4a, c-d, h-i). In addition, according to the classical Bouma sequence (Bouma, 1962) and the revised Bouma sequence of Talling et al. (2012), the ratio between the thickness of turbidite tail (TE) and graded bedding (TA-TD) is <1. In our Dead Sea case study, the typical units of overlying homogeneous mud are several times thicker than the graded bedding (TA-TD) and turbidite tail (TE) of underlying turbidites (Fig. 4a, c-d, h-i), supporting our approach. We estimate the potential uncertainties in the thickness measurement for turbidite tails (TE) are of minor importance when compared with the thickness of overlying thick units of homogeneous mud.\n\n\n4.3\nRecords of homogeneous mud and graded turbidite compared to climate proxies\nThe Dead Sea 220 kyr-long record of sediment flow deposits comprises more than 5, 000 layers of homogeneous mud, graded turbidite, and debrites with unclear triggers. This is probably the largest dataset of sediment flow deposits that have ever been reported. The record of homogeneous mud and graded turbidite cover the MIS 7c-1, i.e. two glacial cycles (Fig. 5\n). The extremely long time span of record enables us to compare the return time and thickness of homogeneous mud and turbidite layers to orbital-scale climate changes (Fig. 5). The record of debrites was not compared to climate proxies due to a small number (N=39) of deposits layers.\nThe thicknesses of homogeneous muds (layers) range between 0.1 and 188 cm. Homogeneous muds are frequent (25-30 layers\/kyr; Mean: 27) and thick (3-10 cm\/layer; Mean: 5.9) during interglacials, and less frequent (8-12 layers\/kyr; Mean: 10) and thinner (2-4 cm\/layer; Mean: 3.3) during glacials (Fig. 5d-e; Table S2; Text S1). The thicknesses of graded turbidites range from 0.1 to 109 cm. Graded turbidites are frequent (7-14 layers\/kyr; Mean: 10) but thin (2-4 cm\/layer; Mean: 3.0) during interglacials, and less frequent (4-12 layers\/kyr; Mean: 8) but thicker (3-5 cm\/layer; Mean: 3.4) during glacials (Fig. 5f-g; Table S2; Text S1).\nAt orbital scales, over MIS 7-1, the periods with thick and frequent homogeneous muds correlate to interglacial low-stand phases with high salinity (Fig. 5a-e) and a higher sedimentation rate (Fig. S2). The periods with thicker graded turbidites correlate to glacial high-stand conditions with low salinity (Fig. 5f, g). Moreover, the variations in return time and thickness of homogeneous mud layer are generally following the change in the global benthic foraminiferal \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO stack and the Dead Sea salinity (Fig. 5a, b, d, e). The homogeneous mud layers are thicker and more frequent when the climate was warmer and water salinity was higher.\n\n\n4.4\nThickness distribution of seven facies during individual glacials and interglacials\nHalite units are mainly formed during interglacials, while gypsum and aragonite-detritus laminae are mainly deposited during glacials (Fig. 6\n). The fraction of homogeneous mud during interglacials (MIS7a-c: 49%, MIS5e: 45%, and MIS1: 52%) is much higher than during glacials (MIS6: 23% and MIS2-5d: 26%). In addition, the fraction of turbidites and debrites during glacials (MIS6: 44% and MIS2-5d: 24%) is much higher than during interglacials (MIS7a-c: 23%, MIS5e: 12%, and MIS1: 5%). Furthermore, during individual interglacials, the thickness fraction of homogeneous mud is one to ten times higher than turbidites and debrites (MIS7a-c: 49% vs. 23%, MIS5e: 45% vs. 12%, and MIS1: 52% vs. 5%). In contrast, during individual glacials, the fraction of turbidites and debrites is one to two times as much as homogeneous mud (MIS6: 44% vs. 23% and MIS2-5d: 24% vs. 26%).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nLinking deposits in geological record to sediment density flows\nField in situ measuring in the Dead Sea reveals that flash flood-generated overflows can reach the lake center, and sediment concentrations of 0.05-0.3 kg\/m3 were measured at 5 km offshore (Fig. 1b) (Nehorai et al., 2013). Moreover, sediment traps deployed in the lake center captured sediment accumulation rates of 17, 12, and 11 g\/m2\/day at water depths of 70, 120, and 170 m following floods that occurred during February 9-March 8 1983, respectively (Fig. 1b, e) (Stiller et al., 1997). According to Stokes' Law, more time is needed for particles settling for a deeper water depth. The decrease in sediment accumulation from 70 to 170 m water depth in a fixed time period indicates vertical settling of suspended clay-fine silts, which supports the interpretation that floods generate sediment-laden overflows that can reach the center of the hypersaline lake. Flood-related surface plumes thus can represent a major process for delivering clay and fine silts to the lake depocenter. We therefore link the homogenous muds in the ICDP Core 5017-1 to flood-generated overflows. Flood-related sediment transport via interflows is considered negligible because the Dead Sea is not stratified during winter (Arnon et al., 2019) when most floods occur in the catchment.\nPrevious studies have revealed that turbidity currents can be generated via three basic mechanisms, (a) plume settling (Lintern et al., 2016; Hage et al., 2019), (b) hyperpycnal river plunging (Mulder and Syvitski, 1995; Heerema et al., 2022), and (c) subaqueous slope failures (Piper and Savoye, 1993; Mulder et al., 1997). Laboratory experiments have suggested that turbidity currents can be triggered by surface plume settling (convective fingering) when sediment concentrations reach 1 kg\/m3 (Parsons et al., 2001). This is significantly lower than the concentration required for hyperpycnal flows to occur (>40 kg\/m3 when \u03c1\nseawater: \u223c1025 kg\/m3) (Mulder and Syvitski, 1995). However, other direct monitoring studies at a fjord-head delta in British Columbia, have shown that turbidity currents can be triggered by plume settling where concentrations are as low as 0.07 kg\/m3 (Hage et al., 2019).\nIn the Dead Sea, sediment concentrations of 0.6-3.9 kg\/m3 were measured for surface plumes at 50 m offshore (water depth: 9 m), following more intense floods feeding through Nahal Arugot (Fig. 1b) during February 29 and March 3, 2012 (Nehorai et al., 2013). Such concentration levels (>0.6 kg\/m3) are estimated to be enough to generate turbidity currents in the Dead Sea (\u03c1\nbrine: \u223c1200 kg\/m3) via the plume settling mechanism (oceanic: \u03c1\nseawater: \u223c1025 kg\/m3, concentration \u22650.07 kg\/m3). Much higher sediment concentrations for the same floods are expected at the river mouth. In addition, suspended sediment concentrations of 50-270 kg\/m3 have been previously measured near the river mouth of Nahal Rahaf-Qanna'im (Fig. 1b) (Cohen and Laronne, 2005). Such high sediment concentrations favor the triggering of turbidity currents via the hyperpycnal plunging mechanism. Hundreds of seismogenic turbidites resulting from subaqueous slope failures have been identified in the ICDP Core 5017-1 (Lu et al., 2021a). Debrites which containing gravel and sands in the core result from debris flows that relate to small delta failures which may be triggered by earthquake shaking (Lu et al., 2017a) or other mechanisms. We thus link the graded turbidites and debrites in the core to underflows.\n\n\n5.2\nTesting hypothesis\nThe ICDP Core 5017-1 was drilled from the lake center and depocenter which receives sediments arriving from the shores surrounding the lake. The thickness of flow deposits preserved in such a core generally indicates the relative duration and magnitude of sediment flows, and thus their total capacity for transporting sediments (K\u00e4mpf et al., 2015). The prominence of thicker, more frequent homogenous muds which make up a high proportion of clastic deposits during interglacials implies that overflows are more prominent during interglacials than in glacials. This is likely a consequence of the greater density of the lake brine during interglacials preventing floodwater from plunging and reducing the rate of suspended particle settling. Furthermore, the upper slopes of high-stand lakes during glacials which accumulated unconsolidated aragonite-detritus laminae, were exposed to erosion during interglacial low-stands. These fine-grained sediments are less likely to develop into underflows, but rather tend to support the development of overflows (surface plumes) during interglacials.\nThe greater proportion of turbidites and debrites during glacials suggests that underflows and the triggering of sediment gravity flows are more likely. The less-dense lake brine during glacials is more favorable for developing turbidity currents via hyperpycnal plunging and plume settling. In addition, the high-stand glacial lakes submerged steeper marginal slopes and preceding interglacial fluvial fans (Fig. 6d-e), making the triggering of slope failures that can transform downslope into debris flows and turbidity currents more likely (Lu et al., 2021b).\nThe deposit thickness comparison also suggests that the relative importance for sediment transport volumes varies between glacials and interglacials. During interglacials, homogeneous muds are >2 times thicker than turbidites and debrites but represent <50% of sedimentation during glacials (Fig. 6; Table 1\n). This also suggests that overflows dominate sediment transport to the basin depocenter during interglacials but this is reversed during glacials. Therefore, the long sediment core dataset confirmed our hypothesis.\n\n\n5.3\nImplications for mechanisms of turbidite generating over glacial cycles\nDuring glacials, 60-90% of turbidites are graded sandy turbidites. The contact between such units and upper sediment layers is usually sharp rather than gradual (Fig. 3k, l; Fig. 4). These units always have distinct erosional bases. However, during interglacials, 50-70% of turbidites are graded muddy turbidites. These units are usually overlaid by thick homogeneous mud with gradual transitions (Fig. 3i, j; Fig. 4). Such units usually have less distinct erosion bases.\nWe infer that the hyperpycnal plunging mechanism is more dominant for generating turbidity currents during glacials when water salinity and density are lower (\u03c1\nwater: 1050-1100 kg\/m3). During these time periods, sand particles (>100 \u03bcm), which formed the lower parts of graded sandy turbidites, are more likely to be carried directly by hyperpycnal river plunging from the river mouth rather than by surface flood plumes. The role of the plume settling mechanism is thought to be minor in forming sand-rich turbidity currents during glacials.\nIn contrast, during interglacials when water salinity and density are higher (\u03c1\nwater: \u223c1200 kg\/m3), medium to coarse silts (<50 \u03bcm) that formed the lower parts of graded muddy turbidites can be carried by offshore surface plumes. This condition is favorable for developing turbidity currents via the plume settling mechanism. At the same time, the greater lake brine salinity and density could prevent floodwater from plunging and weakening the strength of hyperpycnal flows. Larger particle size, higher sediment concentration, and density are required to generate turbidity currents via the hyperpycnal plunging mechanism. The plume settling mechanism is inferred to be more dominant for generating turbidity currents during the interglacials. Consequently, more frequent but thinner turbidites are recorded during interglacials in the ICDP Core 5017-1 (Fig. 5f-g).\n\n\n\n6\nWider implications\nA better understanding of the linkages between modern sedimentary processes, sedimentary dynamics, and the stratigraphic record is essential for subaqueous paleoseismology and paleoclimate research. Our study bridges the gap between our understanding of modern sedimentary processes and the stratigraphic record in a hypersaline lake. Dead Sea is a hypersaline lake in a tectonically active region (Dead Sea Rift Zone), as a result, the lake deposits were controlled by both climate change and geodynamic activity. It therefore has the potential to inform our wider understanding of turbidite paleoseismology as well as paleoclimatic reconstructions in tectonically active subaqueous environments.\n\n6.1\nImplications for turbidite paleoseismology\nTurbidites from lake and ocean sediments located in tectonically active regions have been widely used for geohazard assessments (Goldfinger et al., 2007; Polonia et al., 2013; Moernaut et al., 2014; Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2020). The use of turbidites as a paleoearthquake indicator normally requires a demonstration that seismicity, rather than other factors (e.g., floods), is the most plausible trigger. However, it is common that prehistoric turbidites are used as a proxy without reliable demonstration that an earthquake is the most plausible trigger. Our present study shows that even in an active graben like the Dead Sea, the occurrence of turbidites in the sedimentary archive within a deep central depocenter is modulated by climate change and climate-driven factors (e.g., water level, water density).\nSimilar climate-driven cycles of turbidite deposition from tectonically active regions have also been found in marine settings. Studies from the Peru-Chile Trench (South-Chilean active margin) have identified reduced frequencies of turbidite deposition during interglacials (i.e. MIS 1 and MIS 5). The reduced frequency of turbidites, despite the seismically active nature of the region, is attributed to reduced export of terrestrial sediment to the continental slope as a consequence of interglacial sea level highs and onshore aridity (Blumberg et al., 2008; Bernhardt et al., 2015).\nNonetheless, long-term Turbidite paleoseismology records remain rare. Numerous studies have been carried out on marine (Goldfinger et al., 2007; Polonia et al., 2013; Howarth et al., 2021) and lacustrine (Moernaut et al., 2014; Ghazoui et al., 2019; Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2020) sediments. However, many of these do not extend beyond the Holocene. In many cases, the impacts of climate-driven changes to lake inputs (sediment delivery, water level etc.) on long-term turbidite frequency and therefore the sedimentation regime in which earthquakes are triggering slope failures remains unclear. Establishing the long-term record of changes of sediment dynamic processes therefore appears important when considering paleoseismicity records as this may impact the apparent frequency of turbidity currents triggered by large earthquakes. This underlines the value of comprehensive modern sediment flow monitoring to understand the role of different flow types in contrasting lacustrine and marine environments (Thunell et al., 1999; Hsu et al., 2008; Arai et al., 2013; Henry et al., 2021).\n\n\n6.2\nImplications for paleoclimate research\nThis study shows that variations in thickness and return period for homogeneous mud layers generally follow changes in the global benthic foraminiferal \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO stack during the past 220 kyrs (Fig. 5d, e). Homogeneous mud layers occur more frequently and are thicker when climate is warmer. They are less frequent and thinner when climate is colder. This implies that the thickness and\/or return period of homogeneous mud layers could be a promising proxy for paleoclimate reconstruction in hypersaline lake and ocean environments. Indeed, changes in the number and thickness of these deposits have the potential to inform our understanding of changes to processes which control sediment delivery to these environments as well as the nature of sedimentation.\nIn tectonically active subaqueous environments, like the Dead Sea Graben, turbidites and debrites that result from underflow deposits can be triggered by both climate-induced environmental changes and geodynamic activity (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic activity). Indeed, turbidites generated by different triggers have been reported in sedimentary archives which have been used for long-term climatic reconstructions, such as Lake Baikal (Russia) (Nelson et al., 1999), Lake Van (Turkey) (Stockhecke et al., 2014), and the Gulf of Corinth (De Gelder et al., 2022). In such environments, the overall thickness fraction of turbidites and debrites can be up to 10% of the entire drilled sequence. Paleoclimate reconstructions in these environments would therefore benefit from the removal of these instantaneous event deposits from the sediment sequence.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nWe present a large dataset of sediment flow deposits (N >5,000) from the 457 m-long and 220 kyr ICDP Core 5017-1 from the hypersaline Dead Sea depocenter. Homogeneous muds from the core were linked to overflows, and graded turbidites and debrites were linked to underflows. Orbital-scale climate change has affected the magnitude\/frequency of sediment density flows via changing salinity and density profile of lake water, lake level, submerged area, and source materials. As a result, overflows are more prominent during interglacials, while underflows are more prominent during glacials. In addition, regarding the generating of turbidity currents, the hyperpycnal plunging mechanism is more dominant during glacials, while the plume settling mechanism is more dominant during interglacials.\nThe present research bridges the gap between our understanding of modern sediment density flow processes and deposits preserved in a long-term geological record in the Dead Sea, a tectonically active subaqueous environment (Dead Sea rift zone). It has wider implications for turbidite paleoseismology and implies that in some cases to develop prehistoric turbidites as a reliable paleoearthquake indicator, comprehensive modern sediment flow monitoring is essential. It also has wider implications for paleoclimate research in a tectonically active subaqueous environment. Firstly, the thickness and\/or return period of homogeneous mud layers in hypersaline lake and ocean environments could be a promising proxy for paleoclimate. Secondly, a sedimentary archive is filtered to remove significant instantaneous event deposits such as thick turbidites and debrites could help paleoclimatologists to better reconstruct paleoclimate change.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYin Lu: Conceptualization, Analysis, Validation, Writing original draft, Funding acquisition, Project administration.\n\nEd L.

As a result, small such asteroids are often considered to be rubble-pile objects: aggregates held together by self-gravity or small cohesive forces (Richardson et al., 2002; S\u00e1nchez and Scheeres, 2014). Rubble-pile asteroids may be the most likely type of Near Earth Objects (NEO) to pose a threat to Earth in a future collision event (Popova et al., 2011). A better understanding of cratering processes on heterogeneous, rubble-pile like targets would therefore aid interpretation of the collisional history of small Solar System bodies as well as efforts to design effective asteroid deflection technology.\nNASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is the first space mission to test the controlled deflection of a near-Earth asteroid, the secondary of the 65803 Didymos asteroid system, Dimorphos. The DART spacecraft will impact the small moon and alter its orbital period around the primary, by a measurable amount (Cheng et al., 2018). ESA's Hera mission (Michel et al., 2018) will arrive at Dimorphos a few years after the DART impact and provide a detailed characterization of the impact outcome, including the morphometry and morphology of the DART impact crater. Both of the Didymos system components, the 780 m main asteroid and the 160 m moon, Dimorphos, are assumed to be rubble-pile objects that have separated due to the spin initiated by the YORP effect (e.g., Rozitis et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021).\nRubble-pile asteroids are thought to be composed of blocks (boulders) up to tens of meters in size embedded in finer material. The presence of large boulders may affect the crater morphology, as is apparent on the relatively well-studied asteroids Bennu (e.g., Lauretta et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2019) investigated by NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission and Ryugu, explored by JAXA's Hayabusa2 mission (e.g., Arakawa et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2021). Studies of craters on the rubble-pile asteroid Ryugu, for example, show that abundant boulders on and under the surface have affected crater morphology (Cho et al., 2021). On this asteroid, craters typically have relatively large boulders remaining on the rim forming a circular pattern outlining the crater. Likewise, large craters (diameter >100 m) host abundant and sometimes relatively large boulders on their floors compared with the crater size, whereas small craters (<20 m) are characterized by smooth floors with relatively few boulders compared with the exterior.\n\nCho et al. (2021) suggest that the intra-crater boulders in the larger craters were exposed by preferential excavation of finer material, similar to what was observed for the SCI impact experiment (Small Carry-on Impactor; Arakawa et al., 2020). However, at the smaller craters the crater-forming impact merely removes boulders on or near the surface, which leads to exposure of finer materials just below the near-surface boulders. The SCI impacted a boulder-rich area on Ryugu, and produced a crater approximately 15 m in diameter (Arakawa et al., 2020), causing boulder movement in the close proximity to the crater.\nRecent impact experiments and numerical studies (e.g., Housen and Holsapple, 2011; Jutzi and Michel, 2014; Luther et al., 2018; Raducan et al., 2019) have shown that the ejection behavior and the resulting kinetic impact deflection efficiency depend strongly on the target properties and structure, and are non-unique (i.e., the same spacecraft impact onto asteroids with different target properties can result in the same deflection (Raducan et al., 2020)). For an unambiguous interpretation of the DART impact outcome, therefore, it is imperative to measure both the impact deflection efficiency (often referred to in terms of \u03b2, where \u03b2 represents the change in momentum of the asteroid\/impactor momentum) and the crater size and morphology, to help infer the target properties of the asteroid independently. In addition, it is important to understand the influence of asteroid properties on the cratering process, including the effect of target heterogeneities. For this reason, laboratory scale experiments and rigorously validated impact simulation software, so-called shock physics codes, are essential to predict asteroid deflection by a kinetic impactor.\nA number of previous impact experiments have studied impact cratering in granular media involving projectiles larger than the target grain size (e.g., Cintala et al., 1999), granular media involving projectiles of similar size with the target grain size (e.g., Barnouin-Jha et al., 2005; G\u00fcttler et al., 2012; Tatsumi and Sugita, 2018), or granular media involving projectiles much smaller than the target grain size or heterogeneity (e.g., Durda et al., 2011). We are only aware of one study where impact cratering was investigated in granular media with projectile-sized embedded objects, which are more similar to asteroid surfaces: Housen and Holsapple (2014) performed a set of preliminary experiments at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range into targets with grain sizes about the same as the projectile, or larger. In one experiment they used a 50\/50 random blend of roughly projectile-size grains and clasts with diameters about ten times that of the projectile. The target was suspended with springs of known strength so that the momentum transfer and, thus, \u03b2 could be calculated.\n\nHousen and Holsapple (2014) compared their deflection results with results from similar experiments into both homogeneous and heterogeneous targets of various grain sizes (e.g., Holsapple and Housen, 2012). They concluded that \u03b2 is fairly insensitive to the size of the rubble-pile constituents, even when they are nearly an order of magnitude larger than the impactor. However, the experiment with the 50\/50 mixed target produced a \u03b2 value that was higher than for all the various homogeneous grain size targets. Nevertheless, it was not certain what the reason for the larger \u03b2 value was. Thus, the influence of heterogeneous granular targets on cratering remains poorly understood despite its important implications for the cratering on rubble-pile asteroids.\nHere we present new impact experiments into targets specifically designed to mimic rubble-pile asteroid surfaces, with projectile-size, porous boulders (ceramic balls) embedded in a fine-grained matrix (beach sand). One target configuration considers a scenario with a relatively homogeneous distribution of boulders, whereas a second scenario applies a distinct lateral change in the boulder distribution. A third scenario, with a homogeneous target of the same sand as used as matrix between the ceramic balls, serves as reference. We investigate the effect on crater formation, material ejection, and the final crater morphology. The results are used for the validation of numerical simulations carried out in concert with the experiments.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\n\n2.1\nImpact experiments\nThe impact experiments were conducted at the Experimental Projectile Impact Chamber (EPIC) at Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda CSIC-INTA, Spain (Fig. 1\nA). The design, capacities, and procedures for target and gun preparations of the EPIC, as well as reproducibility of results, are described in detail by Orm\u00f6 et al. (2015). The main component of the EPIC is the compressed-gas gun that can launch 20 mm in diameter projectiles at velocities up to approximately 420 m\/s and at varied impact angles. In this study, we used spherical projectiles of Delrin, which is a micro-crystalline polymer of high strength, hardness, and rigidity that disrupts upon impact at the velocities and target properties used in this study. Orm\u00f6 et al. (2015) concluded that Delrin projectiles are well suited for dry sand targets. They also showed that repeated shots with the EPIC gun into granular targets have high reproducibility (less than 10% difference) and scale consistently with impact craters in the hypervelocity regime both in the laboratory and in nature. These tests suggest that the uncertainty introduced by the experiment set-up is very small. The experiments included in our current study follow the same experimental methodology.\nThe experiments were recorded with a NAC Memrecam GX-8 with a resolution of \n800\n\u00d7\n600\n pixels when set at a frame rate of 5000 fps and the, for these experiments necessary, recording time (approximately 2.5 s). The target was illuminated by five Fotodiox PRO LED100WB-56 Studio LED High-Intensity Daylight lamps.\nWe carried out three quarter-space experiments (cf. Piekutowski, 1980; Orm\u00f6 et al., 2015) with different target set-ups: Experiment 1 \u2013 a complete target of ceramic balls embedded in beach sand (Fig. 1B\u2013D); Experiment 2 \u2013 half the target consisted of ceramic balls embedded in beach sand and the other half was pure beach sand (Fig. 1E\u2013F); and Experiment 3 \u2013 a completely homogeneous target of pure beach sand as a reference.\nThe properties of the target beach sand are described in Orm\u00f6 et al. (2015). Grain size data were measured at Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda CSIC-INTA by standard sieving technique. Friction angle and density were measured at the Boeing laboratory in Seattle (for details see Orm\u00f6 et al., 2015). The beach sand was in all cases applied as \u201cslow pour\u201d to achieve maximum compaction (cf. Orm\u00f6 et al., 2015; Housen et al., 2018), with a density of 1.8 g\/cm3 and a friction angle of 34.6\u00b0. Physicochemical properties of the ceramic balls such as dimensions, mass, density, porosity, and chemical composition were measured at the Centro de Astrobiolog\u00eda CSIC-INTA, and the micro X-ray fluorescence laboratory at Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin (for methodology and details see Suppl. Material 1).\nThe porous ceramic balls, hereafter called \u201cboulders\u201d, are approximately 2.25 cm in diameter, have an estimated unconfined compressive strength of \u22481 MPa, and a porosity of about 66%. Notwithstanding differences in chemical composition, the ceramic material of the balls is considered to be a good mechanical analogue for the boulders found on the rubble-pile asteroids Ryugu and Bennu (cf. Ballouz et al., 2020). The balls were chosen because they have a diameter and density similar to the projectiles. For more details on the target materials see Table 1\n. All targets were covered by a thin layer (<1.5 mm) of colored sand in order to facilitate the analysis of ejecta emplacement.\nThis is a qualitative study of the effects of boulder inclusions in the target. The setup is complex and time consuming and it was not possible to apply a quantitative approach. Therefore, we must rely on the high reproducibility of similar EPIC experiments mentioned above. Nevertheless, there are several additional parameters that we would have liked to have varied but could not because of the said limitations, e.g., spacing between boulders, irregular vs. regular distribution, variable and different boulder size. The extensive experimental effort allowed more systematic studies using numerical methods (see section 2.2); however, further numerical modeling of the experiments are very demanding in terms of computational resources and are beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n\n2.2\nNumerical model\nTo further study the impact scenarios described above, we used Bern's grid-free smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) shock physics code (Jutzi et al., 2008; Jutzi, 2015) to reproduce the EPIC impact experiments. SPH is well suited to model high velocity impacts on heterogeneous asteroids. The code includes material models relevant for geological materials, various equations of state and a porosity compaction model, the P-\u03b1 model (Jutzi et al., 2008).\nThe granular target matrix was modeled using a Tillotson EoS for SiO2 (adapted from Melosh, 2007) and a Drucker-Prager rheology, with a coefficient of internal friction of \nf\n=\n0.56\n. The initial porosity of the target matrix was kept constant at \u224830% and was modeled using the P-\u03b1 model, with a simple quadratic crush curve (Jutzi et al., 2008) defined by the solid pressure, \n\n\nP\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0.2\n GPa, elastic pressure, \n\n\nP\n\n\ne\n\n\n=\n1\n MPa, transition pressure, \n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n0.2\n GPa, transition distension, \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n1\n, exponents \n\n\nn\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n2\n and \n\n\nn\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n2\n, and initial distension, \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n1.48\n. The full description of the P-\u03b1 model implemented in the Bern SPH code is given by Jutzi et al. (2008). The choice of crush curve parameters was informed by the experimental crush curve data for Lane Mtn. 20\/30 sand (Housen et al., 2018). The boulders were modeled using a Tillotson EoS for SiO2, and a tensile strength and fracture model as described in (Jutzi, 2015), with parameters corresponding to a tensile strength of Y\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\u2248\n 1 MPa. The porosity of the boulders was set to match the size, mass and bulk density of the boulders, and was modeled using the nominal parameters \n\n\nP\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0.1\n GPa, \n\n\nP\n\n\ne\n\n\n=\n1\n MPa, \n\n\nP\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n0.1\n GPa, \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n1\n, \n\n\nn\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n2\n, \n\n\nn\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n2\n and \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n0\n\n\n=\n2.0\n.\nThe target was modeled as a half-sphere, with a radius of 28 cm, and was made of 6 million SPH particles. Due to the very long crater growth times, the EPIC experiments described above are very computationally expensive to replicate with SPH. To ensure numerical stability, the maximum simulation time-step, dt, is limited by the Courant criteria (e.g., Anderson, 1987), which for the simulations of the EPIC experiments means that the maximum time-step must be: dt < resolution\/\n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\u2248\n 10\u22127 s, where \n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n is the sound speed in the target. However, the ejecta and boulder re-accumulation occurs after a few hundred ms. To model the entire process with SPH, therefore, we switch to a so-called \u201cfast time integration scheme\u201d in the shock physics code calculation at the time \n\n\nt\n\n\ntransition\n\n\n=\n30\n ms, after the transient crater is formed. At this time, the initial shock and fragmentation phase is over and the late-stage evolution is governed by low-velocity granular flow. This allows us to artificially change the material properties of the target to a low sound-speed (\n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n) medium allowing for a larger timestep. This \u201cfast integration scheme\u201d was described in detail in Raducan and Jutzi (2022). In this phase of the calculation, we apply for all materials a simplified Tillotson EoS, in which all energy related terms are set to zero. The remaining leading term of the EoS is governed by the bulk modulus \nP\n=\nA\n(\u03c1\/\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n), which also determines the magnitude of the sound speed. We use \nA\n\n\u2248\n 1 MPa and also reduce the shear modulus proportionally. The SPH input parameters are summarized in Table 2\n.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nCrater growth and the transient crater\nVisualizations and details on the development of the craters in the three experiments are given in Suppl. Material 2. Crater excavation in Experiment 1 begins with a symmetric bowl-shaped cavity, similar to the homogeneous target Experiment 3, and the growing crater retains this shape until the maximum depth is reached (cf. Melosh, 1989). Analysis of high-speed video footage shows that after the maximum depth is reached the lateral expansion continues until T \u2248 40 ms, when a \u201ckink\u201d develops in the ejecta curtain (Fig. 4A). The emergence of this kink marks the end of excavation. After this time the excavation flow inside the crater has ceased and the ejecta curtain travels away from the crater cavity depositing near-field ejecta behind it to form the crater rim. In the gravity regime, the crater cavity stops growing when the residual kinetic energy is insufficient to displace the target against its own weight. Thus, in the experiments, the moment when the ejecta curtain starts to bend over the forming crater rim, creating the observed kink, defines the time of transient crater formation (\n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n). This time should correspond to the moment of maximum crater volume; however some uncertainty from the definition of the ejecta kink in the video frames is present (Table 3\n). The crater rim formation can be seen until \nT\n\n\u2248\n 60 ms, after which the ejecta curtain continues to move across the surface and the ejecta and boulders are deposited on the target surface by \nT\n\n\u2248\n 300 ms.\nDuring the lateral expansion of the crater prior to \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n, the cavity becomes relatively flat-floored and steep-walled (Fig. 2\n). The crater in the numerical simulation, on the other hand, maintains a deeper, more bowl-shaped profile, albeit with a relatively steep crater wall. This is likely due, at least in part, to the relatively low spatial resolution employed which results in a relatively thick ejecta curtain as well as visualization artifacts (e.g., material around the crater rim is diffuse and has lower density yet it is visualized as an opaque material). It may also be due to a deficiency in the material model used to describe the behavior of the sand. Nevertheless, the fit of the final crater profile between experiment and simulation is good.\nThe earliest stage of crater excavation in Experiment 2 is similar to that observed in Experiment 1 (Fig. 3\n). However, later excavation is clearly affected by the absence of boulders on one side of the target. On the side of the target with boulders, cavity expansion follows that of Experiment 1, whereas on the side with homogeneous sand the cavity obtains a shallow bowl-shape with a lower wall slope angle, as well as lower ejecta curtain angle similar to that of Experiment 3. Nevertheless, there is no noticeable difference in the emergence of the kink in the ejecta curtain (\n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n) between the two halves of the crater (Table 3). However, the transient crater is reached at different times for the full rubble-pile target (Experiment 1) compared with the other two, which may be considered equal in time (Table 3).\nWhen the transient crater shape of the two rubble-pile experiments is compared with that of the homogeneous sand target in Experiment 3 (Fig. 4\nA; Suppl. Mtrl. 2), it is noticeable that the existence of boulders in the target affects the crater growth. In Experiment 1 and 2 the crater wall and ejecta curtain angles are steeper than in the homogeneous sand target (Experiment 3). The transient crater formed in Experiment 1 (rubble-pile target) is 16% deeper, but almost 20% smaller in diameter than the equivalent Experiment 3 crater in homogeneous sand. The Experiment 2 crater in the half-and-half target, as expected, falls in between the Experiment 1 and Experiment 3 craters. The transient crater dimensions are summarized in Table 3. Seven repeated shots by Orm\u00f6 et al. (2015) in homogeneous sand targets show an error of 10% in the transient and final crater-diameters, and 5% in their depths, all factors kept equal. Therefore, we consider the observed differences between our three experiments to be significant.\n\n\n3.2\nFinal crater size and morphology\nThe observed size difference in transient crater dimensions between the rubble-pile target in Experiment 1 and the homogeneous sand target in Experiment 3 remains to some extent also for the final craters (Fig. 4B) although the difference in crater diameter decreases to only about 10%. However, there is no change in crater depth between the transient and final craters. An analysis of the high-speed videos indicates a slight collapse of the initially steeper transient crater wall, especially for the craters formed in targets with embedded boulders.\n\n\n3.3\nImpact ejecta distribution\n\nFigs. 5\nA\u2013C show the crater profiles, including the ejecta curtain, from the three experiments, at three different times (\nT\n=\n20\n, 60 and 80 ms). Our experiments show that the presence of the boulders within the target (i.e., Experiment 1 and the right half of Experiment 2) results in a steeper ejection angle and hence a few degrees steeper ejecta curtain compared to a homogeneous target scenario (Experiment 3).\nOur SPH simulations show good agreement with the experiments in terms of the crater growth and final crater size (Figs. 2, 3). For the visualization of the simulation data, the SPH kernel interpolation is used to compute the continuum density distribution. Using this visualization approach, the fast ejecta (represented by a relatively small number of SPH particles) are not fully resolved and are therefore not visible. However, the underlying mass-velocity distribution of the SPH particles can be used to investigate quantitatively the differences in the ejecta mass-velocity distribution between the three impact scenarios. Figs. 5D\u2013F show the cumulative mass fraction of the ejecta material that is ejected at speeds higher than v\/U, where U is the projectile speed, at three different times (\nT\n=\n20\n, 60 and 80 ms). The data from the SPH simulations show that there is more mass ejected at a given time in the homogeneous target case, compared to the two rubble-pile cases. This result suggests that the presence of the boulders within the target inhibits the ejection process at certain velocities.\nWe integrated the ejecta mass velocity-distribution to determine the cumulative, vertically ejected momentum p\n\nej(z)\/mU = (\n\u03b2\n\n\u2212\n 1), as a function of ejection speed in the vertical direction vz, at \nT\n=\n20\n, 60 and 80 ms (Fig. 5G\u2013I). The differences seen in the ejecta mass-velocity distributions between the homogeneous target (Experiment 3) and the rubble-pile targets (Experiments 1 and 2) are also present in the ejecta momentum distribution, suggesting that the boulders also inhibit the vertically ejected momentum.\n\n\n3.4\nBoulder ejection and redistribution\nThe process of boulder ejection in Experiments 1 and 2 is complex and the boulder's fate depends on where in the excavation zone they were initially placed (Fig. 6\nA). In Experiment 1, the boulder below the impact point was crushed to dust. During the initial stage of the crater formation (induced by the initial shock wave propagation), there is a 0.5 cm downwards displacement of the boulder closest to the impact point in the layer below, but no other boulder displacement is visible. In Experiment 2, the absence of the boulder at the impact point seems not to affect the boulder ejection behavior. A comparison between the final crater morphology (Fig. 4B) and boulder redistribution (Fig. 6B) shows that the boulders in the fully rubble-pile target of Experiment 1 and those of the rubble-pile half of the target in Experiment 2 have nearly identical behavior during displacement and ejection.\nBoulders that were initially placed in the top layer of the target well within the transient crater were excavated with the rest of the sand matrix (Fig. 6A). In both experiments only boulders from the top layer were excavated. Fig. 6A (left) shows a schematic representation of the crater excavation and displaced zones.\nThe boulders remained entrained within the ejecta curtain until they reached an altitude of about a few cm above the pre-impact target level. Here, the boulders become separated from the ejecta curtain and pierce through the ejecta cone (see Figs. 2 and 3), acquiring a \u2018topspin\u2019 (i.e., forward rotation over the top) at the same time. The observed trajectories of the ejected boulders suggest that after detaching from the rest of the ejecta curtain, the boulders have lower ejection angles compared to the finer sand material ejected from similar target positions relative to the impact point. As a result, these boulders land at a greater distance than the continuous sand ejecta layer, i.e., approximately 60 cm from their original positions (see Suppl. Mtrl. 2). Even though these experiments were carried out in the presence of the Earth atmosphere, the difference in the observed trajectories of the boulders and the fine ejecta is not consistent with atmospheric effects, suggesting that a different mechanism (e.g., interaction with the sand particles in the ejecta curtain) is responsible for the boulder and fine ejecta detachment.\nThe passage of the boulders through the ejecta curtain creates transient holes in the sand ejecta curtain (see Suppl. Mtrl. 2). The presence of boulders also results in the focusing of fine sand ejecta into streams that follow the boulders and produce crater rays (Fig. 6B). The effect of embedded objects on ejecta ray formation has also been studied by Kadono et al. (2019).\nThe boulders located at a distance of about three boulder diameters from the impact point (and initially close to the transient crater cavity wall) were exhumed and uplifted onto the crater rim (Fig. 6A, right), None of the ejected or displaced boulders show any visible damage. Fig. 6B shows the final boulder configuration around the crater. The boulder movements were well reproduced by the numerical simulation.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nExperiments and numerical simulations\nTwo of the most conspicuous differences between the part of the experimental craters formed in rubble-pile targets and the part formed in homogeneous sand are the sand matrix ejection angle and focusing of ejecta into rays. The ejection angle is generated by the interplay of pressure gradients (from the radially expanding shock wave, the gradient towards the free surface and the release wave). The ejected boulders behave like one particle, but on much larger scales compared to the sand grains, which means that the boulders on the surface are mobilized later than the surrounding fine material. As a result, the boulders induce a fine-material flow around them, which causes the steeper ejection angle of the fine material (i.e., the sand) and the ejecta rays.\nIn our experiments 1 and 2 and numerical simulations we observe only a small effect on crater dimensions whether or not there was a boulder at the impact point. Nevertheless, there is a small, but noticeable, difference (1 cm) in transient crater radius between Experiment 1 and the boulder-side of the crater in Experiment 2 (Table 3, Fig. 4A), and a more significant difference in \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n (Table 3). To investigate if these differences could be due to the crushing of the porous boulder in Experiment 1, we can calculate the energy required to disrupt the boulder: According to previous studies, the specific impact energy threshold for catastrophic disruption at the boulder size scale is around 1e3-1e4 J\/kg (e.g., Jutzi et al., 2010). Assuming a mass of the boulders of around 5 g, this gives an energy of <50 J needed for disruption. While this value is not an upper limit of the energy needed to pulverize the boulder, it is very small compared to the kinetic energy of the impact, which is around 449 J (397 m\/s impact velocity and 5.7 g projectile mass). However, we also note that the initial kinetic energy in Experiment 1 was slightly (\u223c37 J) higher than in Experiment 2. Therefore, we can say that there is a difference between the experiments (most noticeable in the \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n), but we cannot exactly quantify to what extent this is an effect of the boulder crushing.\nThe reason for the different \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n between Experiment 1 and Experiments 2 and 3 may be due to a combination of factors: Firstly, there is a higher amount of sand in Experiments 2 (the sand side) and 3, compared to Experiment 1, which may result in slightly different bulk properties (i.e., effective friction) of the targets; Secondly, the relationship between \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n and the crater size is non-linear (i.e., a large difference in \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n corresponds to a rather small difference in the crater size (Schmidt and Housen, 1987)); Thirdly, the coupling to the target may be affected by the presence of the boulder at the impact point, albeit as we show above, it may have only a small effect on the crater size. Lastly, part of the difference in \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n can also be attributed to the errors associated with the measured \n\n\nT\n\n\nT\nC\n\n\n (Table 3).\nOur results suggest that impacts on heterogeneous targets similar to the ones investigated in our study produce the displacement of boulders, rather than fragmentation, except for the boulders directly hit by the projectile. Similar results were obtained by Housen and Holsapple (2014) for their 5 km\/s impact experiments into coarse gravel. Our results are also in line with the recent SCI impact on Ryugu that displaced several boulders on the asteroid surface (Arakawa et al., 2020).\nThe small \u2018hump\u2019 at the center of the craters, most notably in Experiment 3, is not a central peak known from natural complex craters (e.g., Melosh, 1989 and references therein) nor is it a \u2018central mound\u2019 due to target layering (cf. Quaide and Oberbeck, 1968; Raducan et al., 2020). This effect was seen previously in other impact and half-buried explosion experiments into compacted granular targets (e.g., Piekutowski, 1977; Mizutani et al., 1983; Schultz and Gault, 1985). We are currently investigating its formation in both quarter-space and half-space target configurations. Preliminary results show that target configuration (e.g., quarter space vs. half-space, rubble-pile vs. homogeneous) is not a factor. Our preferred explanation is that it is an effect of the relatively higher effective compressive strength of densely packed sand grains (i.e., the \u201cslow pour\u201d sand used here, cf. Orm\u00f6 et al., 2015). Densely packed sand is harder to compress downward than to shear outward, compared to a loosely packed sand, which provides less resistance to downward flow. Recent impact experiments in sands of different compaction (Cline and Cintala, 2022) investigated the formation of these humps in more detail and they concluded that the humps might be a consequence of greater shear strengths in granular materials with high coefficients of static friction. Nevertheless, the formation of this small central feature is considered of no significance to the current study.\nPreviously, impact experiments into coarse-grained targets studied the \u201carmouring effects\u201d (e.g., Tatsumi and Sugita, 2018), where the cratering efficiency is reduced due to the energy dissipation at the collision site. It is important to note that armouring effects do not always occur for projectile-to-target grain-size ratios lower than 1 (e.g., Fig. 17 in Tatsumi and Sugita, 2018). The ratio between the projectile kinetic energy to the energy required to disrupt the larger clast in the target is more important than the projectile to grain size ratio (Housen and Holsapple, 2014). Moreover, in our experiments the boulders are loosely packed and are embedded in a much finer granular medium, placing these impact experiments in a different regime facilitating the crater growth compared to the experiments conducted by Tatsumi and Sugita (2018).\n\n\n4.2\nConsequences for impacts on rubble-pile asteroids\nOn asteroid surfaces we expect to find a wide size-distribution of grains and boulders (e.g., from mm to m sized boulders; DellaGiustina et al., 2019; Michikami et al., 2019). An impactor at the average impact velocity in the main asteroid belt catastrophically disrupts a surface grain more than 20 times its own size (Tatsumi and Sugita, 2018). Consequently, only very large surface boulders (larger than a few meters) may affect the craters made by meter-size impactors.\nOur results suggest that a large proportion of the craters we see on asteroids might not have been influenced by armouring effects, and the classical crater scaling (e.g., Holsapple and Schmidt, 1987) still applies. Consequently, the age estimations for rubble-pile asteroids, based on these scaling laws, might also be valid. The boulder size-frequency distribution was not varied in our experiments, however, it may be an important factor when determining the impact outcome.\nIn our experiments, boulders within close proximity of the impact point are ejected at angles close to \u223c45o, lower than the sand matrix and, thus, land at a relatively larger distance. This suggests that impacts on rubble-pile asteroids will redistribute boulders and finer-grained material heterogeneously, potentially resulting in segregation of boulders from fine-grained material.\nMoreover, boulders that were initially positioned close to the edge of the transient crater are exhumed onto the crater rim. The ejection and exhumation of boulders in the excavation zone results in a depletion of boulders between the pre-impact surface and the maximum depth of excavation. Recent observations of the surface morphologies on Ryugu and Bennu observed textural differences between the interior of the craters and their exterior. Craters about \u223c10 m in diameter generally have smoother interiors than the surrounding and compared to larger, >100 m craters. Cho et al. (2021) attributed this textural difference to the presence of a subsurface layer, about 2 m thick, of fine grained material.\nOur laboratory and numerical results are consistent with these observations and we propose that this observed vertical boulder size sorting is produced by impact cratering. Small impacts (which are also the most numerous) exhume the boulders within the excavation zone and produce a segregation of fine material from the boulders.\nBoulders much more massive than the projectile will probably remain on the crater floor, as seen in the case of the SCI impact (Arakawa et al., 2020). Moreover, an increase in kinetic energy would expose deeper located boulders within the target. However, due to the current experimental set-up limitations (i.e., maximum projectile diameter and velocity was applied), this could not be investigated.\nThe quasi-circular distribution of boulders along the crater rim, observed in this study, is consistent with observations of craters at Ryugu (cf. Cho et al., 2021). Similarly, some craters on asteroid Itokawa have smooth floors and concentrically distributed boulders (e.g., Hirata et al., 2009). The accumulation of relatively large boulders on crater rims is also known from much larger impact craters, for instance on the Moon and Earth (Melosh, 1989, fig. 6.1).\nAnother main consequence of the presence of the boulders within the target is a change in crater ejecta morphology. The boulders in our simulations caused a steeper ejecta cone compared to a homogeneous target impact, as well as distinct ejecta rays. Similarly, in the SCI impact, the south side of the crater was obscured by a large \u22485 m boulder and the ejecta cone was separated into four rays of material, as opposed to a continuous uniform ejecta curtain observed for homogeneous targets.\nIn the context of the DART mission, it is likely that the presence of the boulders on, and within, the asteroid surface will affect the ejecta cone and, ultimately, the mass-velocity distribution of the ejecta (similar to the experiments and numerical results presented here) and the momentum transfer efficiency.\nWhile the momentum transfer efficiency, \u03b2, was not directly measured in the experiments, the results from our SPH suggest that for the targets investigated here, the presence of the boulders causes a lower \u03b2. However, ejected boulders from the asteroid's surface, which will depend on the initial boulder configuration on the surface, will also drastically affect our current understanding of asteroid deflection by a kinetic impactor. Future numerical studies with the Bern SPH code will need to investigate in more detail the effects of boulders on Dimorphos, at the scale of the DART impact.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nCrater formation on a rubble-pile like target is a complex process, which involves fragmentation, ejection and displacement of boulders. We used the EPIC facility at CAB CSIC-INTA, Spain, to perform three low-velocity (\u2248 400 m\/s) impact experiments in granular targets with and without projectile-scale boulders. We considered three different target configurations: a granular sand target with boulders embedded in the target at regular intervals across the entire target and with a boulder being disrupted at the impact point, a similar configuration but with boulders only embedded across half of the target and with no boulder at the impact point, and a homogeneous sand target. We conducted SPH simulations that closely reproduced the impact experiments.\nOur experimental and simulation results suggest that, at least for the impact conditions applied here, cratering on heterogeneous targets displaces and ejects boulders, rather than fragmenting them, except for any boulders directly hit by the projectile. In such cases, we see indications that as long as the energy required to disrupt the boulder is small compared to the kinetic energy of the impact, the disruption of boulders directly hit by the projectile has minimal effect on the crater size.\nOn the other hand, the presence of boulders in the target noticeably affects target excavation and ejection. Impacts into the rubble-pile target produced ejecta with higher ejection angles compared to the homogeneous sand target. Boulders well within the transient crater are ejected at lower angles (\u223c45o) than the sand matrix and, thus, land at a relatively larger distance. This suggests that impacts on rubble-pile asteroids will redistribute boulders and finer-grained material heterogeneously, potentially resulting in segregation of boulders from fine-grained material.\nSimulation data also indicates that a greater mass is ejected at higher velocities in the homogeneous target scenario compared to the rubble-pile targets, which results in more momentum in the ejected material. In the context of a kinetic impactor on a rubble-pile asteroid and the DART mission, it is likely that the presence of boulders will reduce the momentum transfer compared to a homogeneous, fine-grained target.\nOur impact experiments and simulations show that boulders embedded just below the surface, inside the crater and near the crater rim are exhumed and distributed radially around the crater rim. Similar patterns have been observed around craters on rubble-pile asteroid surfaces, such as Itokawa, Ryugu and Bennu. Our experiments serve as a useful validation exercise for impact codes and can aid in the interpretation of impact craters seen on rubble-pile asteroids.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJ.

Such excess degassing requires an efficient magma convection mechanism within the feeding system that allows huge parcels of magma to degas without being erupted (Shinohara, 2008). However, this mild and persistent activity characterizing open-vent volcanism can evolve, at times with no or limited precursory signs, into more intense eruptive phenomena such as opening of lateral eruptive vent(s) (Shreve et al., 2019), lava fountain episodes or violent explosions (e.g. Aiuppa et al., 2021; Calvari et al., 2011; Ripepe et al., 2021) that pose a serious hazard for inhabitants living nearby (see also the Nyiragongo May 22-31, 2021 activity as a dramatic example; Boudoire et al., 2022). The processes that drive these rapid changes in eruptive style are difficult to interpret, as they result from a complex interplay between a variety of factors in the deep and\/or shallow plumbing systems (e.g. Calvari et al., 2011; Ripepe et al., 2015; Shreve et al., 2019; Aiuppa et al., 2021).\nThe persistence of background seismicity, gas and\/or thermal emissions (Rose et al., 2013) during regular activity often limits our ability to resolve the small deviations in volcanic behavior that can prelude to eruption onset (Valade et al., 2016). A multiparametric monitoring effort is often key to an effective, near real-time interpretation of volcano network time-series (Ripepe et al., 2005; Phillipson et al., 2013). In this view, a well-established ground- and space-based multiparametric monitoring network makes of Stromboli volcano (Italy) an ideal test site to improve our understanding on open-vent volcanoes (Ripepe et al., 2015; Valade et al., 2016). Stromboli's activity ranges from persistent, mild-explosive activity (here referred as ordinary activity) to less frequent but hazardous effusive eruptions and violent explosions of larger scale (Rosi et al., 2013). In July-August 2019, in particular, an effusive eruption took place, initiated and terminated by two sudden and violent paroxysmal explosions on July 3 and August 28, respectively (Aiuppa et al., 2021; Andronico et al., 2021; Giordano and De Astis, 2021; Ripepe et al., 2021). This sequence of events has represented a real challenge for volcanologist and local civil protection authorities.\nHere, we investigate the mechanisms of the 2019 Stromboli's effusive eruption by combining near real-time ground- and space-based measurements of the SO2 and thermal fluxes, obtained from respectively a permanent UV-camera system (Delle Donne et al., 2017; Aiuppa et al., 2021) and the radiant heat flux (Volcanic Radiative Power, VRP; Coppola et al., 2016) obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). These independent datasets are used to derive rates of magma input into, and output from, Stromboli's shallow magmatic system in a temporal interval (from August 1, 2018 to April 30, 2020) encompassing the July \u2013 August 2019 effusive eruption. We show that the resulting magma input\/output budgets are suggestive of a complex dynamics involving pressure charge\/discharge mechanism as driver for the 2019 Stromboli's effusive eruption. We conclude that combining SO2 and thermal records (D'Aleo et al., 2018; Laiolo et al., 2018) allow better understanding of the explosive to effusive transition at open-vent open-conduit volcanoes. Although specifically designed to investigate the mechanisms of the summer 2019 effusive eruption, our results also contribute some novel insights into the drivers of the August 28, 2019 paroxysm.\n\n\n2\nStromboli volcano: background and 2019 eruptive crisis\nStromboli, the \u201cLighthouse of the Mediterranean\u201d, ranks among the most studied open-vent volcanoes in the world (Allard et al., 1994; Ripepe et al., 2008), and is globally renowned for its regular, millennial, mild-explosive \u201cStrombolian\u201d activity (Rosi et al., 2013). This \u201cordinary\u201d activity manifests into repetitive, discrete gas outburst ejecting bombs, lapilli and ash, occurring during a regular, continuous degassing and puffing activity (Ripepe et al., 2008). This ordinary activity is, much less frequently, punctuated by more energetic events that include effusive lateral eruption, summit overflows, and\/or major\/paroxysmal explosions (Rosi et al., 2013).\nOrdinary activity is fed by a stable degassing process modulated by steady-state convective overturning of the magmatic column, in which gas-rich magma ascends, degases and crystallizes, and then sinks back down the conduit (Allard et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008). This mechanism explains why only a small fraction of magma supplying SO2 degassing at surface is erupted by explosive activity (Allard et al., 1994; Harris and Stevenson, 1997). This magma convection regime is thought to take place within the shallow upper portion of the magmatic column (<3 km depth; Allard et al., 1994; Burton et al., 2009), filled by volatile-poor, High Porphiritic (HP; Francalanci et al., 1999) magma typically erupted during ordinary explosive activity and lava effusions. This HP magma is thought to reside, for 1-60 to 180 years (Petrone et al., 2018; Di Stefano et al., 2020), in a shallow (\u22643 km depth) reservoir of 20-90 Mm3, before being erupted (Bragagni et al., 2014). Paroxysmal explosions occur every \u223c5-10 years on average (Rosi et al., 2013), resulting in the eruption of Low-Porphyritic (LP) magma (i.e. golden pumices) during rapid gas\/magma ascent from a primitive, gas-rich deep magma reservoir (Aiuppa et al., 2021; M\u00e9trich et al., 2010 and reference therein). Paroxysmal explosions, along with lava effusions, pose a real hazard for local villagers, tourists and scientists, considering they can also trigger flank edifice collapses and generate tsunamis (Rosi et al., 2013; M\u00e9trich et al., 2021; Ripepe et al., 2021).\nThe most recent of these \u201cnon-ordinary\u201d activity periods occurred in July-August 2019, when Stromboli was hit by a sequence of events that included: (i) a two-months-long effusive eruption from the volcano's summit, and (ii) two paroxysmal explosions (Giordano and De Astis, 2021). Hereafter, we will refer to this complex series of events as the 2019 eruptive crisis. The 2019 eruptive crisis started suddenly on July 3, 2019, at 14.45 UTC, with the strongest ever recorded paroxysmal explosion of the instrumental era (Ripepe et al., 2021). Within a few minutes, partial collapse of a \u223c8.4 km-high eruptive column (Giordano and De Astis, 2021) triggered a pyroclastic flow that, descending along the Sciara del Fuoco, generated a small (few cm) tsunami wave (Lacanna and Ripepe, 2020). The explosions caused partial failure of the central-southwest (C and SW) crater's outer rim, leading to conduit lava overspilling into the southern Sciara del Fuoco slope (Fig. 1\n). The nearly continuous effusive activity that resulted, sustained by a main effusive vent located in the SW sector of the crater terrace, was accompanied by vigorous explosive activity at the summit craters. The effusive eruption (the main target of this study) lasted until 1 September 2019, three days after a second (slightly less intense) paroxysm that occurred on August 28, 2019 at 10:17 UTC (Ripepe et al., 2021), and that also generated a tsunamigenic pyroclastic flow (Lacanna and Ripepe, 2020).\nDuring its historical activity, Stromboli has been regularly affected by monthly-long effusive episodes during which intense explosions have occurred, and by isolated paroxysmal events not connected to effusive phases (Ripepe et al., 2017; M\u00e9trich et al., 2021 and reference therein). The 2002-2003, 2007 and 2014 effusive eruptions were all preceded by a manifest escalation in ordinary explosive activity, occasionally associated with lava overflows, that culminated with the opening of the lateral effusive vents inside the Sciara del Fuoco (Ripepe et al., 2017). Moreover, the 2002-2003 and 2007 effusions were punctuated by paroxysmal explosions during ongoing effusion, which respectively occurred 98 and 16 days after effusion onset (Calvari et al., 2011; Ripepe et al., 2017; M\u00e9trich et al., 2021). The 2019 eruptive crisis, therefore, differs from the previous eruptive phases in the following aspects: i) lava outpouring in 2019 was directly initiated by failure of the crater caused by a paroxysmal explosion (July 3, 2019); ii) no pre-effusion escalation in ordinary activity was observed in 2019 (in contrast, the driver of the 2002-2003, 2007 and 2014 effusions was an enhancing shallow magma transport and the ensuing intensification of ordinary strombolian activity; Ripepe et al., 2017); iii) the 2019 effusion directly took place from the summit SW crater (and not farther down inside the Sciara del Fuoco scar), and was accompanied by explosive activity that persisted at sustained levels during the entire effusive period, implying no significant drop of the magmatic column (in contrast, the magma level dropped down in the conduit by hundreds of meters during the previous effusive events; Ripepe et al., 2017); iv) a second paroxysmal explosions hit, only 59 days after the July 3 blast.\n\n\n3\nDataset and methods\nWe present results acquired between 1 August 2018 and 30 April 2020 (21 months) by using a permanent, fully automated Ultra-Violet (UV) camera and by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Here, we summarize the methods and analytical procedures used to (i) retrieve the radiant heat power (VRP, in Watt) and the SO2 flux (td\u22121), and (ii) to convert them into magma rates and volumes. The complete datasets and limits and uncertainties of the proposed approach are attached and described in the Supplementary Information.\n\n3.1\nVolcanic Radiative Power (VRP)\nIn order to quantify the Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP, in Watt) at Stromboli, we use images acquired by MODIS sensors mounted on board of Terra and Aqua NASA's satellites, launched in February 2000 and May 2002 respectively. With their polar orbits, these satellites are able to acquire about 4 images per day (2 nighttime and 2 daytime). The MODIS Level 1B data (1 km2 of resolution in the infrared bands) provided by LANCE-MODIS system (http:\/\/lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov\/) is ingested in near real-time into the MIROVA system that outputs, among others, the VRP according to the MIR-method (Coppola et al., 2016). This methodology provides reliable estimates (\u00b130%; Coppola et al., 2016 and reference therein) of heat flux radiated by active lava flows and\/or by any hot source having temperature higher than \u223c300\u00b0C. At Stromboli, the analysis of a fifteen years-long dataset allowed to distinguish thermal activity regimes likely associated to activity spanning from mild-explosive to effusive (Fig. 2\na; Coppola et al., 2016). Within the August 2018 - April 2020 period, 635 out of the 2834 acquired images (\u223c22%) exhibited thermal anomalies related to Stromboli's volcanic activity. In the July \u2013 August period, in order to obtain a more robust characterization of the effusive eruption, a one-by-one visual inspection of each alerted images was conducted, to discard those affected by important cloud coverage and\/or by unfavorable satellite geometry acquisitions (cf. Coppola et al., 2013, 2016). Consequently, the here reported MODIS dataset consists of 513 alerted images; guarantying an overall heat flux estimates on weekly (about 4 detections per week on average) and daily (about 1.7 detection per day, on average) scale, respectively during ordinary and effusive activity.\n\n\n3.2\nUV camera-derived SO2 fluxes: measurement principles and associated errors\nSO2 fluxes are obtained from a permanent, fully automated UV camera system installed in May 2014 on the volcano summit, at about \u223c500 m distance from the active craters (UV1; Fig. 1). Measurement principles of the UV (or SO2) camera, hardware, software and acquisition\/processing routines are described in detail in previous research (see Delle Donne et al., 2017 and reference therein). Our UV camera system is designed to automatically acquire and process sets of images, sampled at 0.5 Hz rate during 6 hour-long daily acquisition cycles (Delle Donne et al., 2017), and has been in operation nearly continuously since June 2014 (the unit is still operational by the time of writing). The UV camera has allowed capturing short and long-term degassing fluctuations associated with changing volcanic intensity through years, particularly those related to the escalation in degassing and explosive activity that preceded the 2014 flank eruption (Delle Donne et al., 2017). Time-series analysis has allowed identifying SO2 thresholds discriminating between normal and enhanced degassing activity regimes (Fig. 2b), such information being reported on a daily basis in the University of Florence bulletins and reports (LGS Report; http:\/\/lgs.geo.unifi.it\/) for the Italian Dipartimento Nazionale della Protezione Civile (DPC).\n\n\n3.3\nMagma input and output rates from SO2 fluxes and MODIS results\n\n3.3.1\nSO2-derived magma input rate\nA commonly accepted paradigm is that Stromboli's long-lived behavior is driven by shallow magma convection, in which degassed, non-erupted magma (on the order of 106 m3y\u22121) is recycled back into the volcanic feeding system (Allard et al., 1994; Harris and Stevenson, 1997). A corollary of this mechanism is that, during \u201cordinary\u201d Strombolian activity, the rate of magma supply (Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n) must be far larger than the mass eruption rate (Q\nout\n) ejected from the active craters. Our aim here is to characterize the Stromboli's Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n\/Q\nout\n shallow magma budget (\u2264 3 km depth. e.g. Ripepe et al., 2005; Burton et al., 2009; Aiuppa et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2019) of the 2019 unrest.\nCalculation of the magma supply (\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n) from the so-called \u201cpetrologic method\u201d (Devine et al., 1984) is based upon scaling the SO2 flux released at the vent(s) to the magma sulfur yield, as inferred from the difference between initial (in the undegassed parental magma; as measured in melt inclusions) and final (upon magma eruption; as inferred from groundmass analysis) dissolved melt S contents (Allard et al., 1994; Shinohara, 2008). This approach circumvents complexities in S degassing behavior deriving from the large compositional and redox dependencies of sulfur solubility, and from the poorly constrained gas-melt S partition coefficients (Oppenheimer et al., 2018 and reference therein) and it has successfully been used to investigate the S budget of large effusive (Kern et al., 2020) and explosive eruptions (Devine et al., 1984), of continuous degassing associated with lava lakes (e.g. Masaya; Aiuppa et al., 2018), of persistent explosive and effusive activities at open-vent (Allard et al., 1994; Coppola et al., 2019).\nThe methodology stands on converting the measured surface (plume) SO2 flux (FSO2, in kg\/s) into magma input rate (Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n) by using equation (Eq. (1)):\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\nF\nS\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u204e\n\u0394\nX\nS\n\u204e\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nm\n\n\n is melt density of the gas-rich magma entering in the shallow system (2500 kg\/m3; M\u00e9trich et al., 2010 and reference therein; Ripepe et al., 2021) and \u0394XS is the S volatile loss, derived from the difference between parental melt volatile content (from undegassed melt inclusions; 2000 ppm S at Stromboli; M\u00e9trich et al., 2010) and the residual S content in the groundmass (200-400 ppm at Stromboli; M\u00e9trich et al., 2010). This latter term takes into account the typical crystal fraction of the LP and HP magma (0.1 and 0.30-0.6, respectively; Stevenson and Blake, 1998; M\u00e9trich et al., 2010; Di Stefano et al., 2020). Overall, this relation allows retrieval of the rates of magma degassing and circulation above the SO2 exsolution level (typically at \u223c3 km depth at Stromboli). This magma input Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n supplies the shallow convective magma circulation within the conduit (e.g. Allard et al., 1994).\n\n\n3.3.2\nVRP-derived magma output rate\nThe correlation between thermal flux, active flow area, and lava effusion rates is established by several works (Coppola et al., 2013, 2016 and reference therein). Here we use the so-called radiant approach, which considers a single radiant density term (c\nrad\n; in J\/m3) to relate lava discharge rate and thermal radiation for any given rheological case, with an overall error of \u00b1 50% (Coppola et al., 2013). Previous works (Valade et al., 2016; Ripepe et al., 2017) demonstrate the effectiveness, during Stromboli effusive eruptions, of the MODIS-derived Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP) conversion into magma output rate (i.e. TADR), using the equation (Eq. (2)):\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\nV\nR\nP\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\nr\na\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nl\na\nv\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nb\nu\nl\nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \u03c1\nlava and \u03c1\nbulk are densities of erupted materials and bulk lavas, respectively. Here, we set a \u03c1\nlava value of 1850 kg\/m3 as representative of the overall erupted materials by considering an average bulk lava density of 2000 kg\/m3 (Burton et al., 2009) and the concurrent emission of HP scorias ejected via explosive activity, with density spanning from 900 to 1500 kg\/m3 (Giordano and De Astis, 2021). A c\nrad\n coefficient of 2.5*108 to 3.75*108 J\/m3 has been used previously (Ripepe et al., 2017) to retrieve lava volumes for major effusive phases. For non-effusive, mildly explosive phases, thermal radiance includes contribution from radiation, convection, conduction and ejection of volcanic tephra (e.g. Harris and Stevenson, 1997). Within this framework, we assume that the VRP measured during ordinary activity corresponds to the rate at which magma reaches a depth shallow enough to produce detectable thermal emissions, before being erupted as lapilli or bombs during explosive events (Aiuppa et al., 2018).\n\n\n3.3.3\nUncertainties of the petrologic method (\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n via SO2 flux) and radiant approach (\n\n\nQ\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n via volcanic radiative power)\nConversion from SO2 fluxes and VRP into magma input and output rates requires independent knowledge of parameters in equations (1) and (2). These are not fully constrained, and their relative changes can affect dramatically our estimated magma volumes. To quantify\/minimize the intrinsic uncertainties of the method, we performed a sensitivity analysis that considers the entire uncertainty ranges of the input parameters. To this aim, from any daily averaged SO2 flux and VRP measurement, we calculate a set of magma input and output rates derived from any possible combination of the petro-physical parameters in eq. (1) and (2). From these, we next calculate the median (50%), and 25-75% quartile distribution boundaries, in order to constrain the intrinsic error associated with the conversion. In particular, for the magma input rate (Qin) calculation, we considered the experimental SO2 flux measurement error of \u00b130%, the residual S content within the groundmass ranging between 200 and 400 ppm, and the crystal fraction of the erupted materials, ranging between 0.45 and 0.6. For the magma output rate calculation, we considered a range of crad between 2.5*108 and 3.75*108 J\/m3 (Coppola et al., 2013) and a bulk density (\u03c1\nbulk) range between 2500 to 2800 kg\/m3 (Cigolini et al., 2015; Ripepe et al., 2015). Due to moderate resolution of the MODIS sensor images (1 km pixel size), we remind that the low-moderate Stromboli summit activity represent a challenge for satellite-based measures (Coppola et al., 2016) thus producing possible large errors on Qout calculation. Applying the method described here, we obtained the magma input and output rate values and their 25% to 75% confidence errors (Figure S1). Combinations between input and output rates are made using their associated minimum and maximum bounds together with their median values.\n\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nVRP and SO2 flux time-series\nOur observations, encompassing a 21 months period centered on the 2019 July-August eruption, highlight a distinct temporal evolution for thermal (VRP) and degassing (SO2) activity (Fig. 2).\nThe \u223c10 months preceding the summer 2019 eruption are characterized by ordinary Strombolian activity, occasionally punctuated by brief (weeks) periods of increased spattering activity and\/or small-volume summit overflows (Fig. 2), as recurrently observed during the latter decade(s) (Coppola et al., 2016). This ordinary activity regime corresponds to relatively steady and low-to-moderate VRP values (typically from 1 MW to 30 MW), with occasional short-lived episodes of VRP increase (to up to 70 MW) that correspond to overflows and\/or spattering activity (December 2018 and January 2019; Fig. 2a; INGV Report; LGS Report). During the same period, the SO2 flux (Fig. 2b) remains at generally low levels (average of \u223c77 t\/d), with transient increases up to 200 t\/d matching the VRP peaks (Fig. 2a). Since May 2019, the SO2 flux exhibits a mild intensification to \u201cmoderate\u201d values of 90 t\/d to 180 t\/d (Fig. 2b) accompanied by thermal signal which record sporadic VRP peaks up to 20 MW (Fig. 2a).\nThe July 3 paroxysmal explosion marks the onset of the 2019 eruption, and is thermally tracked by a sudden VRP increase to \u223c640 MW on July 4, likely due to rapid partial conduit magma drainage into the developing lava flow field, in turn caused by partial crater rim failure during the explosion (Fig. 2, 3\n). This first VRP peak is short-lived, and is followed by fluctuating thermal anomalies (60-125 MW; Fig. 3) during intermittent effusive activity from 5 to 8 July (LGS Report). Starting from July 9, the VRP increases peaking at 470 MW on July 17 (Fig. 3), and reflecting the emplacement of a \u223c30,000 m2 lava field in the upper sector of the Sciara del Fuoco, fed by a lava outpouring from the base of the SW crater (Fig. 1b; Plank et al., 2019). From July 18 onward, the VRP exhibits a waning trend, mimicking an overall decrease of lava effusion until the end of the eruption (September 1), but punctuated by thermal pulses (Fig. 3) likely related to cycles of charge and discharge of lava from the shallow conduit.\nThe SO2 flux (Figs. 2 and 3) exhibits a contrasting trend (relative to VRP), and gradually increases from July 3 (\u223c150 t\/d) to early August, when the \u201cvery high\u201d threshold activity level is reached (LGS Report; Fig. 2). After peaking on August 13 (480 t\/d), circa 40 days after the eruption onset, the SO2 flux then smoothly decreases until the end on the eruption (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that the second paroxysmal explosion occurs on August 28, when both thermal and SO2 fluxes are still high but showing a general decreasing trend (Fig. 3).\nCessation of effusive activity on September 1 is consistently marked by VRP dropping below 100 MW that is the thermal threshold typically marking the ordinary-to-effusive transition at Stromboli volcano (Coppola et al., 2016). In the post-effusive phase, the persistent of moderate VRP levels (Fig. 2a), and the relatively high (\u223c30%) detection frequency of thermal anomalies, concur to indicate relatively high frequency of strombolian explosions (LGS Report) or, at least, shallow magma circulation in the upper conduits (Coppola et al., 2016). In parallel, the SO2 flux continues to slowly decline, with background (low) levels being restored in early November (Fig. 2b).\nWe estimate that, in the 21 months-long analyzed period, the total thermal energy emission is \u223c1.3*1015 J, and the cumulative SO2 release is \u223c67 ktons (Fig. 2a, b). More than 70% of the heat (\u223c0.9*1015 J), but only 25% of total SO2 emissions (17 ktons), are released during the 60 days of the eruption, at average rates of 175 MW and 280 t\/d, respectively.\n\n\n4.2\nMagma input and output rates\nIn the pre-eruptive phase (August 2018 \u2013 July 2, 2019), our calculated (eq. (1)) Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n is systematically higher (0.1 to 0.3 m3\/s) than Q\nout\n (eq. (2)) (Fig. 4\na). The latter averages at \u223c0.003 m3\/s and reaches (or slightly exceeds) 0.1 m3\/s only during the short-lived lava overflows (e.g., January 2019; INGV Report; LGS Report). These estimated Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n and Q\nout\n values for ordinary activity match those previously obtained (Allard et al., 1994; Harris and Stevenson, 1997; Ripepe et al., 2005). In contrast, during the July 3 - August 31, 2019 eruption (Fig. 4a), both Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n and Q\nout\n markedly increase, and range 0.12-0.65 and 0.05-1.35 m3\/s, respectively. Q\nout\n exceeds Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n during the initial phase of the effusive activity, but this condition is reversed (\n\n\nQ\n\n\nout\n\n\n<\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n) since August 2019 (Fig. 4a).\nWe use the RQ parameter (\n\n\nR\n\n\nQ\n\n\n=\n\n\nQ\n\n\nout\n\n\n\/\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n; Fig. 4b) to characterize the magma input\/output relationship more effectively, and to identify distinct thermal\/degassing behaviors at Stromboli.\nRQ ranges between 0.1 and 0.01 during ordinary activity (i.e., before July 3, 2019; Fig. 4b), confirming only a small fraction (<10%) of magma supplied to the shallow conduits (and degassing) is eventually erupted via typical Strombolian activity. In contrast, during the 2019 effusive phase, RQ ratio increases to \u223c1 or more (Fig. 4b), suggesting a major change in shallow magma dynamic within the conduit.\nThe contrasting ordinary (R\n\n\n\u223c\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n0.1\n) vs. effusive (R\n\n\n\u223c\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n\n1) magma dynamics are illustrated in Fig. 5\n. Q\nout\n increases by about three orders of magnitude from ordinary to effusive activity, while Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n increases by less than one order of magnitude among the two regimes. An increase of Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n during the 2019 magma effusion at Stromboli is consistent with the dynamics already observed during the 2014 lava flow at Stromboli (Delle Donne et al., 2017), but the SO2-VRP comparison further allows to evaluate the amount of magma actually recycled and stored back within the shallow magma reservoir.\n\n\n4.3\nSupplied vs. erupted magma volumes\nWe quantify the total magma volumes involved during the observational period (Fig. 6\n) by cumulating the volumetric magma input\/output rates (Fig. 4). We show that about 8.0 Mm3 (\u00b11.2 Mm3; Fig. 6a) of magma have degassed (at a mean input rate of 0.14\u00b10.02 m3\/s) during the 21 months-long investigated period; during the same interval, only about 2.7\u00b10.3 Mm3 of magma have been erupted (at a mean rate of 0.05\u00b10.01 m3\/s) (all volumes quoted here are as Dense Rock Equivalent, DRE; see Method section). We additionally calculate that, during the ordinary activity regime, about 0.8 Mm3 (\u223c14%) of the 5.6 Mm3 degassed magma is erupted (the average rates are of ca. 0.015 m3\/s and 0.11 m3\/s). In contrast, during the effusive eruption, the cumulative trends accelerate relative to the ordinary regime (Fig. 6a), and the total input and output magma volumes are roughly equivalent (Volin, 1.95\u00b10.3 Mm3; Volout, 2.05\u00b10.25 Mm3), further demonstrating a deviation from equilibrium condition. Our derived erupted lava volume (2.05\u00b10.25 Mm3) is significantly lower than that obtained by means of space-based thermal measurements (6.3 \u00b1 3.17 Mm3; Plank et al., 2019), but agrees well with those obtained by topographic-based methods (1.5 Mm3 - 2.1 Mm3; Di Traglia et al., 2021a and reference therein). The discrepancy between our estimate and that of Plank et al. (2019) reflects a combination of (i) a different image database used (see Method section) and (ii) a different crad value adopted, leading to a large uncertainty (50%) in the volume retrieved by Plank and coauthors, and (iii) the fact that our estimates are expressed in terms of dense rock equivalent.\nIn order to focus on magma dynamics associated with the effusive eruption, we subtracted the time-averaged ordinary trend (i.e. the amount of magma supplied to, and erupted from the shallow reservoir during ordinary Strombolian activity) from the cumulative Volin and Volout curves, and calculate the residual (excess) input and output magma volumes (Fig. 6b). The excess magma input volume (excess Volin) exhibits a moderate, \u223c1 month-long acceleration prior to the effusion onset that is not associated with any concurrent excess Volout increase (Fig. 6b). More importantly, the eruption onset marks an abrupt change-in-the-slopes in the excess Volin and Volout curves (Fig. 6b) that reflects an anomalously fast magma transport, especially in the first two weeks of the eruption (during which \u223c1\u00b1 0.2 Mm3 of lava were discharged). Notably, the Volin and Volout curves exhibit different evolutionary trends during the eruption, but converge at the end of the eruption, when the cumulative excess Volin and Volout balance out (Fig. 6b).\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nModeling magma dynamics within Stromboli's shallow reservoir\nSteady-state magma convection in the conduit is thought to drive the long-lasting persistent mild explosive activity at Stromboli, and is the cause for the observed excess degassing (Allard et al., 1994; Harris and Stevenson, 1997). Long-term GPS measurements (Bonaccorso et al., 2009) and satellite InSAR observations (Di Traglia et al., 2021b) point against any long-term deformation of the volcano edifice, suggesting that magma convection does not cause significant volume changes in the Stromboli's plumbing system over decadal timescales (Bonaccorso et al., 2009; Di Traglia et al., 2021b; Mattia et al., 2021).\nIn the magma convection hypothesis, mass conservation requires magma input (Qin) and output (Qout) rates to be linked by the following equation:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nin\n\n\n=\n\n\nQ\n\n\no\nu\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n where QD is the descending degassed magma flux (recycled back into the conduit). We derive the descending magma flux as the net difference between input (Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n) and output (Q\nout\n) magma fluxes (Q\nD\n= Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n - Q\nout\n, see Fig. 4a).\nResults highlight a stable Q\nD\n (\u223c0.1\u00b10.02 m3\/s; here referred as Q\nD\n\nORD) during ordinary activity, when Q\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\u223c\n Q\n\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n implies a high recycling efficiency of the convective column (i.e., 90% of the degassed magma is recycled back into the conduit and not erupted; Fig. 7\n), in agreement with earlier observations (Allard et al., 1994; Francis et al., 1993; Harris and Stevenson, 1997). A similar degassing regime has been proposed to explain excess S emissions at many other volcanic systems of mafic (e.g., Manam and Etna) to intermediate\/silicic (e.g., Bagana and Santiaguito) compositions, at lava lakes (e.g., Masaya), and at volcanoes that exhibit mildly explosive (e.g., Yasur) or lava dome building activity (e.g., Popocat\u00e9petl) (see Shinohara, 2008; Edmonds et al., 2022 and reference therein).\nIn contrast, QD strongly deviates from the stable long-term behavior during the 2019 effusive eruption (Fig. 7), with Q\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n<\n0\n in the initial phase of the eruption, indicating more magma is erupting than being supplied to the feeding system. Then, during the second half of the effusive eruption, Q\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nORD, implying heightened magma circulation and recycling efficiency relative to ordinary activity. The occurrence of Q\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n=\n0\n conditions (i.e., effusive phases) implies the magma convection mechanism is temporary suppressed, as already observed at other open-vent systems (e.g., Ambrym and Etna) during lateral effusions or short-lived lava fountaining activity (D'Aleo et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2019; Shreve et al., 2019). Notably, the 2007 and 2014 Stromboli's effusive phases, erupting about 9.5 Mm3 and 5.5 Mm3 (Ripepe et al., 2017), rapidly drained from the shallow conduit by lateral vents. The subsequent replenishment of the shallow conduit (Cigolini et al., 2015; Ripepe et al., 2017) was also accompanied, with complex timing, by similar magma dynamics (e.g. Burton et al., 2009; Cigolini et al., 2015; Delle Donne et al., 2017).\nThe overall long-term stability of QD (Fig. 7) during ordinary activity reflects the efficiency of the convective column in recycling degassed magma back into the conduit, while replacing it with an equivalent amount of undegassed magma. This process is not associated by any significant volume and pressure change within the conduit, as evidenced by the lack of long-term deformation (Bonaccorso et al., 2009; Di Traglia et al., 2021a,b). Convection efficiency is controlled by conduit radius and viscosity of descending magma (Stevenson and Blake, 1998), which are unlikely to vary over timescales of a few days. We therefore argue that any change in the descending magma flux QD, relative to its equilibrium state QD\nORD during ordinary activity:\n\n(4)\n\n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n=\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\nO\nR\nD\n\n\n\n\n must produce a transient modification in the volume of the resident magma, and ultimately a transient pressure change within the conduit and\/or shallow reservoir.\nFor such transient changes in the magma flow dynamics, we can approximate the volcanic system as behaving as a closed system, therefore expanding or contracting in response to any change in the resident magma volume. In this assumption, we can estimate the pressure change (\u0394P) from the change in volume (\u0394V) using: \n\u0394\nP\n=\n\u0394\nV\n\/\n(\nV\n\u204e\n\u03b2\n)\n where \u03b2 is the magma compressibility of the system and \u0394V\/V is the change in volume relative to the total volume of the shallow (HP) magma reservoir (V). Then, considering that \n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n=\n\u0394\nV\n\/\n\u0394\nt\n, we can quantify the rate of pressure change \u0394P\/\u0394t from the observed magma flux perturbations \n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n (excess descending magma flux) in the shallow magma feeding system (Fig. 7):\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\nV\n\n\n\n\n where V is the total volume of the shallow (HP) magma reservoir, \u03b2 is magma compressibility, and \n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n is the excess descending magma flux (Fig. 7). Considering a magma compressibility \u03b2 of 1 to 5*10\u22129 Pa\u22121 (Cigolini et al., 2015) for the shallow (<3 km) HP magma, and a HP magma feeding system volume of 20-90 Mm3 (Bragagni et al., 2014), we estimate the maximum pressure changes induced by transient variations in the excess descending magma flux (Fig. 7).\nThe relative \n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n (Eq. (4)) and \u0394P (Eq. (5)) changes allow defining four distinct volcanic activity phases. The ordinary phase preceding the eruption (Phase I in Fig. 8\n) is characterized by \n\u0394\n\n\nQ\n\n\nD\n\n\n\u223c\n\u0394\nP\n\/\n\u0394\nT\n\u223c\n0\n (Fig. 7) and Q\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nout\n\n\n\n<\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n (Figs. 4\u20136). On July 3, 2019 the onset of the effusive activity (Phase II in Fig. 8) marks an abrupt Q\nD\n decrease, indicating more magma is being discharged than supplied (Qout > Qin). This phase, lasting for \u223c40 days and corresponding to decompression rates of 1-30 Pas\u22121 (Fig. 8), is interpreted as caused by rapid drainage of upper conduit resident magma (Q\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nout\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\ni\nn\n\n\n; Fig. 4), ultimately leading to a cumulative decompression of \u223c10 MPa. Early in August 2019 (Phase III in Fig. 8), the Q\nD\n and \u0394P trends exhibit an inversion from negative to positive values (Fig. 7), indicating onset of a new magma recharge phase (Qin > Qout; Figs. 4\u20136) characterized by restored vigorous magma convective circulation in the conduit. The strong similarities between erupted and degassed magma volume estimates (Fig. 6) suggest that Phase III occurred in response to the rapid decompression in Phase II, e.g. that upward migration of deeper magma occurred to re-establish the equilibrium conduit conditions that were disrupted by rapid conduit emptying in Phase II. This phase culminated into the August 28 paroxysm. Finally, after the August 28 paroxysm (Phase IV; Fig. 8), the excess magma flux (\u0394Q\nD\n) decreases and magma input rate (Fig. 4) and SO2 flux (Fig. 2) return in early October back to the pre-eruptive trend. This phase thus corresponds to magma input rate returning to the ordinary level of \u223c0.1 m3\/s (cf. Fig. 4), and an overall re-establishment of the pre-eruptive dynamical equilibrium conditions with \u0394Q\nD\n and \u0394P (Fig. 7) close to 0. In summary, our results see the summer 2019 sequence as phases of discharge (Phase II)\/recharge (Phase III) of the shallow Stromboli's feeding system, temporarily interrupting the ordinary convective magma circulation regime during ordinary activity (Phases I and IV).\nOur results indicate that the effusive eruption is associated with an average daily decompression rate of up to 30 Pa\/s (Fig. 7), and with a cumulative decompression \u0394P of \u223c10 MPa in July 2019. This estimated pressure change is easily reconciled with the absence of measured deformation at surface during the eruption: assuming an open-conduit model, we infer that the observed pressure changes (Fig. 7) would have resulted into ground deformation rates (\u223c0.01 - 0.1 \u03bcrad\/day) and cumulative deformations (of 1-10 \u03bcrad for the entire eruption) well below those detectable by tiltmeters, and within their non-volcanic thermo-elastic noise (Bonaccorso et al., 2009). We additionally argue that the high magma compressibility, primarily determined by the exsolved volatiles in the magma (Huppert and Woods, 2002), may also contribute to explain the apparent discrepancy between the relatively large volume change in the conduit and the lack of significant ground displacements at the surface (McCormick Kilbride et al., 2016; Mattia et al., 2021).\n\n\n5.2\nImplications for paroxysmal activity at Stromboli and for open-vent volcanoes\nOur study, although admittedly having the 2019 effusive eruption as its primary target, also contributes to the debate on the dynamics and mechanisms driving the Stromboli's paroxysmal explosions (Aiuppa et al., 2021; Calvari et al., 2011; Ripepe et al., 2017, 2021; Andronico et al., 2021; Giudicepietro et al., 2020; M\u00e9trich et al., 2021; Viccaro et al., 2021). Petrologic evidence indicates that the gas-rich magma erupted during Stromboli's paroxysms is sourced by rapid magma transport from the deep (7-10 km) LP reservoir (Francalanci et al., 1999; M\u00e9trich et al., 2021). These models for a deep source of the paroxysms are consistent with gas (Aiuppa et al., 2021) and ground deformation (Ripepe et al., 2021) data, but have recently been challenged by observations\/models that point to a shallow trigger (<1000 m deep) and\/or put the accent on failure of the uppermost highly-viscous magma cap (Mattia et al., 2021; Viccaro et al., 2021). To add complexity, two recent paroxysms in 2003 and 2007 occurred during ongoing effusive activity, suggesting a causal mechanism between lava outpouring and paroxysms. Calvari et al. (2011), in particular, argued that paroxysms may be the ultimate result of decompression of the deep plumbing system, driven by emptying of the upper part of the magmatic conduit, especially in case of high lava discharge rate (Valade et al., 2016; Ripepe et al., 2017). Bottom-up (ascent of gas-rich magma) and top-down (effusion-driven) mechanisms can also coexist within the same unrest, as indicated by the contrasting source processes suggested for the July 3, and the August 28, 2019 explosions (Aiuppa et al., 2021).\nOur observations suggest that the July 3 paroxysm occurred when thermal and degassing activity were at the low to moderate levels (Fig. 2). However, we observe a mild SO2 flux increase since May 2019 (Fig. 2) that, if combined with independent geophysical and volcanological observations (Andronico et al., 2021; Giudicepietro et al., 2020; Mattia et al., 2021; Viccaro et al., 2021), may be interpreted as evidence of escalating magma transport (Figs. 4, 6) in the shallow magmatic system starting about one month prior to the July 3. Gas observations (Aiuppa et al., 2021) indicate that the July 3 event was preceded by a precursory release of CO2-rich bubbles sourced by later erupted LP magma; fluxing by deeply rising CO2-rich bubbles may have therefore caused the accelerating shallow magma circulation (Fig. 4), SO2 degassing (Fig. 2) and rate of ordinary explosions (Andronico et al., 2021) prior to July 3. We yet observe that this SO2 flux increase is very mild, and that similar increases have frequently been observed during ordinary activity periods without having been followed by any paroxysm. This, and the fact that far more intense SO2 flux variations, furthermore accompanied by persistent moderate to high thermal detections, have been observed prior to onset of effusive eruptions (Delle Donne et al., 2017; Valade et al., 2016), cast doubt on the \u201cprecursory\u201d nature of this May 2019 SO2 flux variation - that, as other supposed volcanological\/geophysical precursors (Andronico et al., 2021; Giudicepietro et al., 2020), was only identified after post-hoc data analysis and re-processing. One important aspect, however, is that we find no evidence in our SO2 flux record of a reduced gas output prior to the July 3 event. Therefore, our observations point against models invoking a role played by rheological stiffening and reduced permeability of the upper conduit magma as trigger for the blast (Mattia et al., 2021; Viccaro et al., 2021), and rather suggest rapid ascent of deep gas-rich magma and\/or gas (M\u00e9trich et al., 2021; Aiuppa et al., 2021) as a more likely trigger.\nThe August 28 paroxysm occurred during the effusive crisis, when SO2 and heat flux were both high (Figs. 4\u20137). In this case, as discussed previously in Aiuppa et al. (2021), our observations are consistent with the top-down mechanism, in which de-compressional, fast ascent and degassing of deep magma may have occurred in response to a rapid drainage of resident conduit magma into the lava flow field. The decompression rates calculated here for the 2019 eruption overlap with those estimated for recent paroxysms occurred in 2003 and 2007, for which the drainage of shallow magma during effusive activity has been considered as the trigger for LP, volatile-rich magma rise from depth (Aiuppa et al., 2021; Ripepe et al., 2017).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nOur space- and ground-based measurements have allowed to shed light into conduit magma regime prior, during and after the 2019 Stromboli's effusive eruption. We show how thermal and SO2 flux can be used to calculate the magma input and output rate. Our results confirm the large and well-known unbalance between magma input and output rates into the shallow (<3 km deep) feeding system during ordinary Strombolian activity, which is explained in terms of a convective regime. We demonstrate, for the first time, that this ordinary convecting magma regime was temporarily interrupted during the 2019 effusive phase, during which the output magma rate balanced, or even exceed for the first two weeks of the eruption, the magma input rate. We interpret our data in view of a discharge\/recharge mechanism of the shallow plumbing system feeding surface activity; the partial failure of the SW crater outer rim during the July 3 paroxysm caused rapid emptying of the shallow upper conduits (\u223c50 m) leading to magma drainage into a rapidly developing lava flow field (Phase II). This event caused a \u223c10 MPa decompression of the shallow plumbing system, which ultimately caused (in the ensuing Phase III) the ascent of new magma in the conduit to totally replace the \u223c2 Mm3 of magma erupted. This new conduit recharge phase may have been implicated as causal factor in forcing deep magma ascent during the August 28 paroxysm. Finally, besides the complexity of linking erupted and supplied magma volumes with continuous reliable estimates, our results also point out how these parameters, if well constrained, may allow to define changes in magma dynamics and ultimately in eruptive styles at active volcanoes.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nM.L., D.D.D. conceive the manuscript.

Global cooling initiated in the late Cambrian, and proceeded rapidly during the Early Ordovician, before tropical sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) reached a plateau during the Middle to Late Ordovician and subsequently stabilized at modern-like levels (Fig. 1\na) (i.e., \u223c30\u00b0C; Goldberg et al., 2021; Song et al., 2019; Trotter et al., 2008; Scotese et al., 2021). The striking feature of this climatic transition is its magnitude, with tropical temperatures plummeting by around 10\u00b0C, from \u223c40\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, excluding the short-lived end-Ordovician Hirnantian cooling (445-444 Ma) (Finnegan et al., 2011; Trotter et al., 2008) (Fig. 1a). During the Ordovician cooling phase, the global climate transitioned from a greenhouse state to the first major continental glaciation of the Phanerozoic, with continental glacial onset argued to have occurred sometime around the Darriwilian (Fig. 1a,b) (\u223c467-458 Ma; e.g. Pohl et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016) or the Katian (453-445 Ma; Cocks and Torsvik, 2020; Loi et al., 2010), but peak glacial activity occurred during the short-lived Hirnantian cooling (Finnegan et al., 2011; Ghienne et al., 2014).\nRecent studies suggest an intricate coupling between climate and marine biological evolution throughout the Ordovician. The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) marked the radiation of the marine animal phyla that had emerged during the Cambrian Explosion (Cocks and Torsvik, 2020). Biodiversification may have been driven by cooling to more habitable temperatures alone (Trotter et al., 2008; Rasmussen et al., 2016), or in conjunction with the ensuing ocean oxygenation (Edwards et al., 2017), both being known to act synergistically on marine ectotherm habitability (Deutsch et al., 2015; Stockey et al., 2021). Ordovician cooling was not only associated with a significant increase in the number of different complex animal forms during the Mid Ordovician (\u223c470-455 Ma; GOBE), but the later Hirnantian cooling (with SSTs averaging 22 \u00b1 6\u00b0C) coincided with the only known mass extinction to have occurred during icehouse conditions (Torsvik et al., 2021).\nThe cause(s) of the long-term Ordovician cooling trend remain(s) poorly understood due to the sparsity of data and the large spread of temperature estimates (Fig. 1a). First, temporal trends from oxygen isotope data (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO) may be distorted by diagenesis, although meticulous screening for pristine samples and trace element analyses and the use of material supposedly resistant to diagenesis (such as biogenic apatite) permit gaining confidence in reconstructed temperatures (Hearing et al., 2018). Second, the heterogeneous spatial sampling of proxy data can create an underestimation of climatic perturbations, which has been shown for the Ordovician (Jones and Eichenseer, 2021). Absolute temperature values are even more challenging to constrain compared to temporal trends, due to large error margins associated with functions used to convert isotopic values to temperature (L\u00e9cuyer et al., 2013), as well as uncertain constraints on early Paleozoic seawater isotopic compositions. Some studies suggest that the seawater isotopic composition has remained unchanged (e.g. Henkes et al., 2018) while others follow the secular trend idea of the Veizer hypothesis (Veizer and Prokoph, 2015) of a gradual enrichment of the 18O isotope (e.g., Galili et al., 2019; Hodel et al., 2018; Defliese, 2020).\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Ordovician long-term cooling, either by increasing the weatherability of the continents or by decreasing the amplitude of the solid Earth degassing. On the one hand, Earth's surface weatherability increases when continental drift brings continents into the warm and humid equatorial area (Nardin et al., 2011, Fig. 1b) in response to early land-plant colonization (Lenton et al., 2012; Porada et al., 2016), or, for example, through increased weathering of mafic silicate rock linked to physical erosion through changes in topography (Kump et al., 1999; Young et al., 2009; Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald, 2017; Macdonald et al., 2019). On the other hand, volcanic outgassing rates may have decreased through the early Paleozoic (McKenzie et al., 2016). The search for a unique causative mechanism for the long-term Ordovician cooling trend is elusive and these various factors may all have played a role. Unfortunately, these different hypotheses have been proposed in isolation using different methods and tools, and the importance and contribution of each of these factors remain to be quantified in an integrated numerical framework.\nHere, we use the climate-carbon model GEOCLIM (Donnadieu et al., 2006-updated) to simulate the long-term Ordovician climatic trend in response to changes in paleogeography and associated silicate weathering activity as well as changes in volcanic degassing rates.\nThe model is fed by climatic fields that have been simulated using the atmospheric general circulation model LMDz6 (see Supplementary material) based on improved continental reconstructions (Marcilly et al., 2021). The GEOCLIM model accounts for the competing impacts of continental weathering and volcanic outgassing on the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and climate. This allows us to quantify the magnitude and temporal trend in global cooling, resulting from these competing mechanisms, and evaluate their relative contributions. In order to quantify the respective roles of paleogeography and degassing, we first explore the impact of continental drift alone, by calculating its imprint on continental weathering rates throughout the Ordovician under a constant pCO2. Then, the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to paleogeography and carbon degassing variations is investigated by coupling the climate and carbon cycles in the GEOCLIM model. This study highlights the current limits of our understanding of factors driving the early Paleozoic climate and presents conceivable directions for future studies.\n\n\n2\nThe paleogeographical imprint on Ordovician climate\n\n2.1\nResponse of weathering to the continental configuration\nTo explore the interplays between Ordovician paleogeography and chemical weathering, we ran the LMDz6 climate model (see Supplementary Information) with late Cambrian to early Silurian paleogeographic maps ranging from 490 Ma to 430 Ma at 10 Myr intervals (7 time slices from Marcilly et al., 2021, see Supplementary Fig. S1). Several models for the tectonic and paleogeographic evolution exist for the Ordovician (e.g. Scotese, 2016; Blakey, 2009; Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald, 2017), but we here chose to work with the global model developed by Torsvik and collaborators (2012, 2016), which forms the basis for the exposed land maps produced in Marcilly et al. (2021; see details in supplementary section G).\nIn order to isolate the paleogeographical imprint, the pCO2 in our simulations is fixed at 12 PAL (3360 ppmv) (i.e., Pre-industrial Atmospheric Level; 1 PAL = 280 ppmv) to avoid strongly non-linear climate responses associated with sea-ice feedbacks encountered at lower pCO2 levels (Pohl et al., 2014, 2016). We vary the model solar luminosity with geological age (from \u223c1313 W m\u22122 at 490 Ma to \u223c1320 W m\u22122 at 430 Ma) according to the model of stellar evolution (Gough, 1981).\nAt the global scale, the global mean surface temperature (GMST) remains relatively constant at \u223c22.5\u00b0C (Fig. 2\na) in our simulations. However, the continental climate (i.e., temperature, runoff, and discharge) is more sensitive to paleogeographical changes (Fig. 2a, b; Fig. 3\n). The most important observations include significant continental warming between 490 Ma and 480 Ma (Fig. 2a), as well as local maxima of global dryness at 480 Ma and 450 Ma (Fig. 2b, Fig. S2 in SI). From 490 to 480 Ma, the global mean temperature over the continents increases by 4\u00b0C (from 14.5\u00b0C to 18.6\u00b0C), followed by fluctuations between 17\u00b0C and 19.3\u00b0C during the rest of the investigated time period (Fig. 2a). The warmest episodes occur at 480 Ma, 460 Ma, and 430 Ma when the Gondwana continent extends less over the South Pole region.\nIn the tropical band (i.e., from 21\u00b0S to 21\u00b0N), the annual mean temperature increases by 2\u00b0C (from 30.1\u00b0C to 32.1\u00b0C) from 480 to 430 Ma (Fig. 2a), mainly due to the solar constant increase. Despite the large fluctuations in emerged land surface, reaching a peak of \u223c36 \u00d7 106 km2 in the tropics by 450 Ma (40% of the total land exposed, Table S1 in SI), the paleogeography has apparently little influence on the modelled terrestrial temperature in the tropics (Fig. 2a).\nIn the subtropics, arid zones are larger at 480 Ma and 450 Ma compared to other periods (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S2), which is when the surface of the Gondwana continent located below the descending branch of the Hadley circulation is at its maximum. The increase in aridity (i.e., areas where mean precipitation minus evaporation is inferior to 0) is also favoured by the drift of smaller blocks (Southern part of South-China and Baltica) entering into the subtropics between 460 and 440 Ma (SI Figs. S1, S2).\nPrecipitation and runoff reach maximum values over scattered islands in the equatorial belt and equatorial Gondwana (Fig. 3). A second belt with significant runoff is shown by all model runs at mid to high latitudes (i.e., between 40\u00b0S and 80\u00b0S), reaching maximum values over the western coast of Gondwana and the western edge of mountain ranges (Fig. 3; see also Pohl et al., 2017). The slight decoupling between the mean continental runoff and globally cumulated continental discharge at 450\u2013440 Ma is due to an increase in the total area of emerged (exposed) lands between 490 and 450 Ma. This land area increase counteracts the drop in mean continental runoff. Collectively, these results explain why the Late Ordovician and early Silurian configurations (440 Ma, and mostly 430 Ma), and to a lesser extent, the 470 Ma configuration, between the two \u201cdry intervals\u201d (480 and 450 Ma), are associated with the highest weathering rates (Fig. 2c & Fig. 4\n, SI Fig. S4).\nOverall, these results demonstrate a long-term increase in continental weathering in response to continental rearrangement during the Ordovician rather than a sudden rise at the end of the Ordovician (Fig. 2c & 4). This progressive enhancement of Earth's surface weatherability (see also Marcilly et al., 2021) should lead to a pCO2 reduction, a point explored in the following section.\n\n\n2.2\nClimate-carbon response to continental drift\nWe explore the climatic evolution over the entire Ordovician assuming a constant degassing rate of the Earth. We couple the LMDz6 climate model with a long-term carbon cycle model to compute the steady-state climate, based on the climate-carbon negative feedback (Walker et al., 1981). The resulting climate-carbon model, GEOCLIM (Donnadieu et al., 2006-updated), is described in the Supplementary Information and available online. The calculated CO2 consumption by silicate rock weathering is calibrated on the present-day state: this means that under present-day conditions, the model predicts the silicate weathering flux of the main world rivers (Park et al., 2020). The corresponding global silicate weathering (3.3 Tmol of CO2 consumed each year) is close to the estimate by Gaillardet et al. (1999) (2.5 Tmol\/yr). This implies that the solid Earth degassing must be close to the CO2 consumption by silicate weathering. To reach a steady state at present day, we assume that the magmatic degassing of the present day Earth is equal to 3.3 Tmol\/yr of CO2. This value is close to the CO2 degassing estimates by Gerlach (2011) (3.4 to 5.9 Tmol CO2\/yr). Therefore, to highlight the effect of paleogeography alone, the solid Earth degassing rate for all experiments was set to 7.1 Tmol C\/yr and kept constant. This value is equivalent to about 2 times that of the present-day, which corresponds to the average degassing level over the studied period from proxies for seafloor spreading (the proxies and corresponding values are presented in section 3.1). As shown in Fig. 5\na (black line), the pCO2 drops from 30 to 18 PAL (i.e., 8400-5040 ppm) between 490 and 430 Ma (Table S3 in SI), in response to the increasing surface weatherability (Fig. 2c).\nThe substantial drop in pCO2 observed between 480 Ma and 470 Ma induces an important global cooling event, with GMST decreasing by 2.5\u00b0C (Fig. 5b; black line). Between 470 Ma and 430 Ma, although pCO2 slightly decreases (Fig. 5a), pCO2-driven cooling is counteracted by the paleogeographical evolution accompanied by an increase in solar luminosity which, everything else unchanged, impose a warming from 470 Ma to 430 Ma (Fig. 5b, orange curve). As a result, the modelled global temperature slightly increases from 470 Ma to 430 Ma (Fig. 5b; black curve). Therefore, in our model, the paleogeographical forcing alone cannot explain the long-term Ordovician cooling trend reported based on geological data (Goldberg et al., 2021; Song et al., 2019; Trotter et al., 2008).\n\n\n2.3\nClimate-carbon response to enhanced topography\nIn order to test the effect(s) of changing topography, we ran three sets of simulations with varying topographic inputs. The first simulation (i.e., run #1, \u201crevised topo\u201d in Fig. 6\n) aimed to test the effect of higher altitudes, and so the altitudes were doubled compared to our previous simulations. Secondly, the influence of more substantial island arcs and obducted arcs were tested (Macdonald et al., 2019). To do so, new maps with increased relief areas and same doubled altitudes as in run #1 were created (i.e., run #2, \u201cincreased topo\u201d in Fig. 6; see SI Fig. S7 for maps). The third set of simulations (i.e., run #3, \u201cincreased topo + slope\u201d in Fig. 6) are similar to the second, but with increased slopes to accentuate the effect of increased topography on physical erosion, and hence on chemical weathering (see SI Fig. S8). All tests were first performed with constant degassing in order to isolate the topography effect (Fig. 6a).\nThe higher altitude simulations (run #1) led to similar temperatures compared to the previous simulations with low topography, even slightly higher between 460-440 Ma, and no intensification of the cooling can be observed (Fig. 6a). As the influence of topography is increased by taking into account larger accretion zones and island arcs (run #2), the temperature at 440 Ma is slightly lowered (Fig. 6a), but almost negligible as showing only a \u22120.18\u00b0C difference. Even with steepened slopes (run #3), the difference only reached \u22120.51\u00b0C (Fig. 6a). Contrarily to our first simulations with constant degassing and lower topography (Section 2.2), which suggest a warming from 450 Ma, all the simulations with enhanced topography suggest cooling from 460 Ma and lasting until 440 Ma.\nThese results show that changing topography does not have a large influence on the simulated Ordovician climatic trend. Taking into account larger topography and steeper slope does make the Earth slightly cooler (by \u223c1\u00b0C compared to the revised but not increased topography), but quasi uniformly on the whole period, since there is no significant temporal variation of global topography (growth nor decay) over the studied period. Therefore, the climatic trend is virtually unchanged, except for a slight prolonged cooling at 450-430 Ma in the increased topography and slope simulation. However, it is important to note that only modest changes in topography have been tested, as this parameter is poorly constrained through time.\n\n\n\n3\nTransition from a warm climate state to the ice age\n\n3.1\nTesting a variable degassing throughout the Ordovician\nThe Ordovician long-term cooling trend could potentially be attributed to fluctuations in the major long-term carbon sources. However, as direct measurements for solid Earth degassing in the Ordovician do not exist, we must rely on proxies. The long-term solid Earth degassing mainly occurs at spreading ridges, volcanic arcs and continental rifts (Kelemen and Manning, 2015). Reconstructions of degassing fluctuations through time have traditionally been based on the past activity of seafloor spreading, and such estimates are commonly used in long-term carbon cycle models (Berner, 2006; Godd\u00e9ris and Donnadieu, 2019; Mills et al., 2019; Pohl et al., 2020).\nHere we use two proxies for seafloor production rate, which in turn act as a proxy for solid Earth degassing (Fig. 7\n). The first is based on estimates of subduction fluxes from the full-plate model of Domeier and Torsvik (2014) extended back to the early Paleozoic (Marcilly et al., 2022) (see SI for more information). Note that the early Paleozoic estimates have large uncertainties since all the oceanic lithosphere prior to the Jurassic has been subducted and absolute longitudes in the Paleozoic are strongly debated. We here estimate uncertainties associated with the subduction flux based on previous versions of our subduction flux estimates (Fig. 7). The second proxy is the age distribution of zircon presented in Marcilly et al. (2021). Considering the increasing uncertainty of subduction flux estimates with deeper time, the age-frequency relationship of detrital zircons, mimicking variations in the subduction flux, both regionally and globally has been suggested as a more objective proxy for seafloor production (Domeier et al., 2018; McKenzie et al., 2016; Marcilly et al., 2021). Uncertainties for this proxy are based on its difference with subduction flux estimates in more recent time (Fig. 7). This zircon-based proxy suggests solid Earth degassing values in the same order of magnitude compared to other proxies commonly used in long-term carbon cycle modelling (e.g., Berner, 2006; Mills et al., 2019; Godd\u00e9ris and Donnadieu, 2019; Merdith et al., 2021; Fig. 7), although it suggests lower estimates towards the end-Ordovician and a slight decrease between 480 Ma and 430 Ma. In contrast, the subduction-flux-based proxy we use here suggests higher values, especially between 490 and 470 Ma.\nBy introducing an up-to-date variable degassing reconstruction from subduction fluxes in the GEOCLIM simulations, the GMST temporal trend is amplified (Fig. 5b; purple curve) compared to simulations performed with a solid degassing held constant (Fig. 5b; black curve). While the Early Ordovician becomes warmer compared to the constant degassing scenario (Tmax of 28.5\u00b0C vs. 26\u00b0C at 480 Ma; Fig. 5b), the model now predicts a cooler Late Ordovician climate (22\u00b0C vs. 24.5\u00b0C at 440 Ma; Fig. 5b). However, even by combining paleogeographical evolution and solid Earth degassing variations, our model fails to reproduce the full extent of the observed tropical SST drop derived from proxy data (Song et al., 2019; Goldberg et al., 2021; Fig. 8\n). The lower degassing scenario derived from the zircon-based proxy produces simulations generally more in line with proxy temperatures (Fig. 8c). However, the high temperatures of the Early Ordovician are well out of reach, with a maximum SST modelled at 32.5\u00b0C at 480 Ma against \u223c40\u00b0C from proxies (Fig. 8c). In summary, the simulation based on the subduction flux degassing matches more closely the proxy data between 490-480 Ma while the zircon proxy degassing curve is a better match from 470 Ma and onwards (Fig. 8b, & 8c), even if the total cooling intensity is only \u223c2.5\u00b0C (Fig. 8c).\nIncreasing the topography with varying degassing does not lead to a more pronounced global cooling (Fig. 6b,c), and contrarily to simulations with constant degassing, this trend is not changed nor intensified between 460 and 440 Ma. Here as well, the change in values at 440 Ma is negligible with a maximum change of only \u22120.42\u00b0C with subduction flux degassing (Fig. 6b) and \u22120.53\u00b0C with zircon degassing (Fig. 6c).\nOverall, our simulations match the Early Ordovician cooling trend, but cannot explain why the cooling continues after the Middle Ordovician (\u223c460 Ma) and lasted for more than 40 Myrs (Fig. 8). It should be noted that, although various models and temperature reconstructions point towards a Mid-Ordovician cooling (Trotter et al., 2008; Rasmussen et al., 2016) there are no known Mid-Ordovician glacial deposits that can confirm this (Cocks and Torsvik, 2020). Furthermore, while the proxies suggest a total cooling of more than 10\u00b0C (Fig. 8), our results show that the tectonic settings (from subduction fluxes) can drive a cooling close to 4\u00b0C. This is in agreement with regional \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO data from Baltica, suggesting a drop of 4-5\u00b0C during the Middle Ordovician (Rasmussen et al., 2016).\n\n\n3.2\nLinking the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO record, paleogeography, and degassing\nRegarding the conundrum of the Mid-Late Ordovician cooling, we complete our study by permitting the model parameters to reconcile modelled and proxy-derived SSTs. For that purpose, we adopt an inverse modelling approach by prescribing a tropical SST from the proxy reconstructions as a target in our model and calculating the degassing rate required to reproduce this Ordovician SST trend. We consider two alternative SST targets: after Goldberg et al. (2021) or after Song et al. (2019), both here averaged over 10 Myrs to fit our reconstruction intervals (see Fig. 1a & 8). The latter estimates have been checked to reflect only tropical temperatures (Marcilly et al., 2021). Further, Late Cambrian to early Silurian SSTs are almost exclusively derived from (apatite) conodonts that once lived from 12\u00b0N to 23\u00b0S (mean paleolatitude = 13\u00b1 5\u00b0N\/S). These SSTs should therefore reflect a reasonably well constrained cooling trend over the Ordovician with respect to the underestimation from biased geographical sampling described by Jones and Eichenseer (2021).\nThe two sets of temperature estimates differ mostly during the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician, but following this time period, their trend and absolute values are similar and within error margins of each other (Figs. 1a, 8). While the estimates by Song et al. (2019) are based on phosphatic fossils (conodonts), the ones from Goldberg et al. (2021) are from bulk rock isotopes. The scarcity of estimates in both studies may represent a limitation mostly for 490 Ma where only a few points are analyzed. In particular, the spread of the estimates is the largest for the Ordovician between 490-480 Ma in Goldberg et al. (2021), and therefore might represent the least constrained interval of their study as all data for this age is extracted from the same location (i.e., Newfoundland at the equator at the time). Similarly, the data reported in Song et al. (2019) become depleted of data coverage for 490 Ma after filtering and therefore reflect only an extrapolation of the continuity between the late Cambrian and 480 Ma. Therefore, we cannot rule out a local anomaly such as a temperature low as reconstructed in Goldberg et al. (2021).\nThe degassing rate scenarios obtained using the inverse approach differ significantly compared to those previously used in this study (Fig. 9\na). For example, the inverse approach suggests that 10.7 to 11.8 Tmol C\/yr would be required in order to match the observed mean tropical SST at 480 Ma (i.e., 38-41\u00b0C; Song et al., 2019; Goldberg et al., 2021), which is significantly higher compared to the solid Earth degassing rate set in our previous experiments (averaging to 7.1 Tmol C\/yr; see section 2.2). On the other hand, to simulate temperatures cooler than 30\u00b0C at 450 Ma, the solid Earth degassing must be reduced to modern-day values (Fig. 9a).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nThe existence of extremely high temperatures in the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician remains uncertain as interpretations of observed \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO data are debated. Two models for the early Paleozoic temperature exist; the \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d models (Scotese et al., 2021). Studies supporting the \u201ccool\u201d model suggest that the long-term trend in seawater \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO is due to an enrichment of the heavier oxygen isotope (18O) through geological time and does therefore not reflect change of the water temperature. This model, often referred as the \u201cVeizer hypothesis\u201d (Veizer and Prokoph, 2015), argues that early Paleozoic seawater was enriched in the light oxygen isotope (16O) because of this evolution and that the high temperatures of the early Paleozoic are not accurate (Fig. 10\n). The main obstacle to this hypothesis is the lack of a primary mechanism that could trigger such a change, but also that other records that do not show the same feature. Those records support the \u201chot\u201d model, which builds on the fact that the isotopic composition of seawater has remained constant so that the lighter \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values accurately reflect warmer paleo-temperatures during the early Paleozoic (e.g. Henkes et al., 2018; Bergmann et al., 2018) (Fig. 10a,b). Moreover, the peak in SST during this interval followed by a sharp cooling is well in agreement with the Cambrian radiation and mostly the GOBE demonstrating a strong (negative) correlation between biodiversity expansion and temperature (Cocks and Torsvik, 2020).\nIf the \u201chot\u201d model is correct, the state of the carbon mass balance during the Early Ordovician must have been largely different from the modern one. Indeed, the SST reconstructed from sedimentary \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO records considering the \u201chot\u201d hypothesis are critically high for the Early Ordovician and difficult to reproduce with a 3D-climate model. Tropical temperatures above 40\u00b0C require very high atmospheric CO2. Those levels will necessarily depend on the sensitivity of the climate model to atmospheric CO2 (SI Fig. S5). But regardless of what this sensitivity was in the deep past, which has been estimated to be \u223c3\u00b0C per CO2 doubling during ice-free periods (greenhouse climates) and \u223c6\u00b0C per CO2 doubling in the presence of land ice (Royer, 2016), or fluctuating from 2 to 5\u00b0C (IPCC working group 1: Solomon et al., 2007), simulating temperatures above 40\u00b0C in the tropical ocean will necessarily require very high levels of CO2. To generate a very warm tropical ocean, CO2 levels as high as 300 times the present-day partial pressure are required in our models. By comparison, such levels are close to the post-snowball glaciation levels (Le Hir et al., 2008). We consider such CO2 levels to be unrealistically high for the early Ordovician, however, they cannot be ruled out, because no reliable CO2 proxies are extended further in the past than the Late Ordovician.\nBy targeting the proxy-based temperatures in our model, we have shown that the high CO2 values prevailing in the early Ordovician would require a release flux of carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system of about 3 to 5 times that of the present-day volcanic outgassing (Fig. 9a). A factor of 3 to 5 decreasing to only 1 over 30 Myrs (Fig. 9a) would require drastic, and perhaps unrealistic, changes in the geodynamic settings since the largest reduction in degassing reconstructed from proxies is by a factor of 2.2 (observed over the past 120 Myrs; Marcilly et al., 2021).\nIf we consider the proxy record as being biased (such as in the Veizer hypothesis; Fig. 10), then the calculated temperatures become significantly lower for the Ordovician. If our models with both degassing scenarios fit this \u201ccool\u201d model until 470 Ma, the simulated temperatures plot well above the data of Veizer following this time period (Fig. 10b). In order to simulate such temperatures, an even sharper decrease in degassing needs to be invoked, which seems unrealistic considering the tectonic activity of the time period and that the zircon degassing proxy already suggests the lowest estimates among different reconstruction methods.\nReconstructing actual CO2 outgassing levels of the early Paleozoic is challenging. Considering the tectonic settings of the early Ordovician (490-480 Ma), with the initial rifting of the Rheic Ocean between Gondwana and Avalonia, a high rate of seafloor spreading is plausible. A change in volcanic outgassing has previously been argued to represent the principal driver for Ordovician climate change (McKenzie et al., 2016). However, no full-plate models, nor other methods to assess seafloor spreading (e.g., age-zircon distribution, sea level inversion, subduction zone lengths, continental rift lengths, or combinations of these) have ever suggested such high rates during the Phanerozoic or even the Neoproterozoic (Godd\u00e9ris and Donnadieu, 2019; Marcilly et al., 2021; Mills et al., 2019).\nAdding fluxes from continental rifts (Brune et al., 2017) and explicitly considering the intersection of continental magmatic arcs with carbonate-filled basins (e.g., Lee and Lackey, 2015) could certainly increase solid Earth degassing during the early Ordovician, but an additional release of carbon required to sustain high temperatures may come from other sources than solid Earth degassing. Imbalances in the organic carbon cycle may theoretically release CO2 into the ocean and atmosphere if the oxidation of reduced sediments exposed on the continents exceeds the burial of organic carbon. The overall increase in the carbonate \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC from the base of the Ordovician to the Upper Ordovician sections suggests a progressive predominance of burial versus oxidation (Veizer et al., 1999; Edwards and Saltzman, 2016; Hu et al., 2021) which is compatible with a decreasing carbon release from the Early to the Late Ordovician. However, the amplitude of the decrease needed to explain the Ordovician cooling is extremely large. If we assume that the \u201cmissing\u201d Early Ordovician carbon source originates from the organic carbon sub-cycle instead of the outgassing flux, then the early Paleozoic must have been characterized by a very low organic carbon burial rate, or by significant oxidation of reduced sediments on the continents. Simple mass balance calculations show that if this were the case, the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC of seawater would be as low as \u221220\u2030 PDB in the Early Ordovician, far below the observed value of about \u22122\u2030 PDB. Finally, another process able to release carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system is the oxidative weathering of sedimentary pyrite exposed in the uplifted regions. This process generates sulfuric acid, which dissolves carbonate rocks, releasing carbon in the rivers and ultimately in the ocean (Torres et al., 2014). However, it has been shown that this carbon source is only transitory and cannot drive the long-term evolution of the carbon cycle (Maffre et al., 2020).\nSimilar to the high temperatures of the Early Ordovician, our simulations do not replicate the cooling trend reconstructed based on proxy data (Figs. 1 & 8b,c). However, it should be noted that only the mean tropical SST has been considered, while proxy data have been collected at various geographical locations. Accounting for the spread of simulated SSTs at various longitudes within the tropical band reduces the model-data discrepancy (Fig. 8b,c). However, the corresponding \u00b11 \u03c3 SST envelope, more representative of common SST conditions found in the simulated climatic states, remains far from capturing the proxy-derived temperatures (Fig. 8b,c). Moreover, when invoking changing degassing, the correlation between our models and the latest temperature reconstructions (i.e., Song et al., 2019; Scotese et al., 2021 & Goldberg et al., 2021) is reasonable with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 for both scenarios (Table 1\n).\nOur simulations reveal that the paleogeographical evolution on its own cannot explain observed Ordovician cooling, and if no change in solid Earth degassing is accounted for, the continental drift and masses distribution imposes a warming from 470 Ma onward (Fig. 5b). This is highlighted by the very low Pearson coefficient correlation between the latest temperature reconstructions and our model (0.2; Table 1). This observation differs slightly from the findings of Nardin et al. (2011), even if, globally, both studies show a similar flat trend in temperature (i.e., maximum variation of \u223c3\u00b0C). However, these authors used the GEOCLIM model with a fixed degassing, as well as a simpler representation of continental weathering. Their climatic fields were derived from a previous generation of the model, based on a lower spatial resolution (FOAM) of different continental reconstructions (Nardin et al., 2011). Further, the temporal resolution of this study was also lower compared to our study, with one GEOCLIM simulation every 20 Myrs (vs. 10 Myrs). Discrepancies between Nardin et al. (2011) and the results presented here reflect therefore differences in the continental reconstructions, the climate model, and the representation of continental weathering (Park et al., 2020). The major difference between these two GEOCLIM studies is that the model of Nardin et al. (2011) is able to create a cooler climate by the end of the Ordovician, whereas the update provided here, benefiting from new constraints on paleogeography, does not support global cooling triggered by changes in land distribution.\nConstraining pCO2 thresholds for the glacial onset during the Ordovician has been the topic of a range of studies, going back to Crowley and Baum (1991). Some of these studies coupled climate models to land-ice models, which effectively simulate ice-sheet nucleation (Herrmann et al., 2004; Lowry et al., 2014; Pohl et al., 2016). Due to differences in the models and boundary conditions, values reported by these studies are widespread (1120 ppm to 3360 ppm; Herrmann et al., 2004; Lowry et al., 2014; Pohl et al., 2016). Pohl et al. (2016) used a similar climate modelling setup as our study (LMDz6 forced with FOAM-derived SSTs, see Supplementary Information), so these results might be the most comparable. The simulations presented here yield CO2 levels below the 3360 ppm threshold as suggested by Pohl et al. (2016) by 440 Ma, at the end of a 40-Myr cooling (Fig. 5a). Therefore, we demonstrate that CO2 levels for the Ordovician are compatible with the onset of a glaciation such as the short-lived Hirnantian glaciation (445-444 Ma), even though the intense global cooling as shown by proxies cannot be replicated. For comparison, other carbon cycle models, such as GEOCARBSULFvolc, estimate CO2 levels almost similar to the simulations presented here when applying the same degassing parametrization (variable age-zircon distribution degassing; Marcilly et al., 2021). This study estimated theoretical glacial inception levels at 1035 ppm and 2142 ppm, based on climate sensitivities of 6\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C. Assuming an even lower climatic sensitivity (2\u00b0C) yields a threshold as high as 4434 ppm (Fig. 5a).\nModel-data disagreement in our simulations may come, at least in part, from the limitations of our models. Regarding the climatic component, results are necessarily model-dependent. More particularly, the double intertropical convergence zone, which represents a very general bias of ocean-atmosphere general circulation models, and is amplified in our simulations by the continental configuration featuring vast ocean basins at low latitudes, reduces precipitation rates over tropical emerged lands (Figs. 2, 3). This bias alters the climate-weathering relationship. In addition, due to the large number of simulations required to force the carbon cycle component, we did not run the ocean-atmosphere version of our CMIP6-class model. Instead, the atmospheric component (LMDz6) was forced with SSTs derived from an ocean-atmosphere model of a previous generation run under identical boundary conditions (FOAM see Supplementary Information). Such setup, used in previous work (Ladant et al., 2014; Licht et al., 2014; Pohl et al., 2016), may also lead to bias in our results, although this impact remains difficult to quantify. Importantly, we emphasize that uncertainty in the model climatic sensitivity would only alter the simulated pCO2 and not affect simulated temperatures, which constitute our focus. Another source of uncertainty could come from the computation of weathering rates. The recent developments embedded in the version of GEOCLIM used here (Park et al., 2020) largely rely on continental topography, which is used to derive local slope and physical erosion rates (see Supplementary Information). Therefore, uncertainties in topography on land, inherent in every deep-time study due to the lack of robust and widespread proxies for paleo-elevation, constitute a limitation in our work.\nThe inability of our climate-carbon cycle model to simulate the long-term Ordovician cooling trend may also reflect missing mechanisms. In particular, including the impact of land plant colonization on weathering could help reconcile models and proxies (Porada et al., 2016; Lenton et al., 2012). However, the impact of non-vascular land plants on weathering is debated (Edwards et al., 2015; Porada et al., 2016). In addition, recent studies pinpoint the impact of the colonization scenario on weathering rates (Maffre et al., 2022), and this colonization remains poorly documented in the Ordovician. Consequently, the impact of non-vascular plants on Ordovician climate evolution remains elusive.\nAnother possible mechanism to explain the intensification of climate change during the Ordovician could reside in the weathering of obducted volcanic arcs as recently demonstrated by Conwell et al. (2022). Indeed, this study argues, using 87Sr\/86Sr seawater records, that a shift in the weathering source lithology is synchronous with the Ordovician cooling, and this can be linked to enhanced weathering of uplifted mafic oceanic crust associated with the Taconic orogeny. This hypothesis has also been suggested by several authors (i.e., Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald, 2017); Macdonald et al., 2019). Macdonald et al. (2019) placed Laurentia about 10\u00b0 more northward between 480 and 444 Ma (Fig. 11\na) compared with our reconstructions (see SI Fig S6), motivated by exhuming mafic and ultramafic lithologies during arc-continent collisions within the warm and wet tropical latitudes (\u00b110\u00b0). Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald (2017) argued that a Taconic-related increase in silicate weatherability contributed to long-term Ordovician cooling, but this was not quantified in their study. One way of estimating changes in silicate weatherability is to examine the amount of exposed land where chemical weathering is assumed to be the most intense. Exposed land within \u00b1 10\u00b0 was steadily increasing during the Ordovician (SI Table S1), peaking at around 450 Ma with \u223c22 \u00d7 106 km2 or \u223c24% of total land exposed between 10\u00b0S and 10\u00b0N. In the Late Ordovician, we estimate about 3000 km globally of ophiolite-bearing sutures in our paleogeographic model or \u223c5500 km in the Swanson-Hysell and Macdonald (2017) model. These estimates are based on Macdonald et al. (2019) but here revised since no Ordovician ophiolites are known in Greenland and all Ordovician ophiolites in Baltica (Fig. 11a) were obducted in the Silurian (e.g., Andersen and Andresen, 1994; Jakob et al., 2022). Fig. 1 in Macdonald et al. (2019) at 445 Ma, therefore, requires a major revision in suture lengths. In order to compare suture lengths with exposed land we (generously) assume an obduction width of 100 km, and as a simple theoretical exercise we multiply the resulting area by a factor of 10 to account for potentially higher weatherability of mafic\/ultramafic rocks and elevated topography (Dessert et al., 2003; West et al., 2005). Note, however, that hydrothermal basaltic alteration and ultramafic serpentinization would have lowered their weathering efficiency compared to direct weathering of juvenile volcanics. This exercise shows that the potentially added weathering effect of obducted rocks in the tropics (compared to the amount of exposed land, mostly \u2018granitic\u2019) amounts to 27% at most, and as low as 3% considering the Scotese (2016) reconstructions (Fig. 11).\nAdding the potential effect of obduction and increased weathering using the GEOCARBSULF model (e.g., increasing the f\nAw\/\n\n\nf\n\n\nA\n\n\n parameter, i.e. \u201cfraction of land area undergoing chemical weathering\u201d) results in a theoretical CO2 reduction of 150 ppm in our preferred paleogeographic model (Fig. 11b). This exercise however, assumes that the climate gradients during the Ordovician were similar to modern times, but the occurrences of evaporites in Laurentia at low latitudes suggest a dry climate, rather than warm and wet tropics (e.g., Boucot et al., 2013; Torsvik & Cocks 2016; Torsvik et al., 2021).\nWhen integrating island arcs and increased topography linked to obducted arcs as suggested by Macdonald et al. (2019) (Fig. 6, SI Fig. S6 and SI Fig. S7), our simulations did not yield any large effect linked to topography. Moreover, considering the trend in cooling enhancement seen in the simulations with a shift from low to moderate topography, only a considerable change towards very high relief can trigger large fluctuations.\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nBy using a spatially resolved climate-carbon cycle Earth system model fed with updated continental reconstructions and new estimates of volcanic degassing, we show that the Early Ordovician high temperatures can be modelled within error margins of the proxy data. However, our new constraints cannot explain the intense cooling over the Mid to Late Ordovician even if revealing a progressive enhancement in Earth's surface weatherability. The calculated, theoretical degassing scenario necessary to reproduce the proxy-derived Ordovician long-term cooling trend features degassing rates reaching 3 to 5 times that of the current value, which is not supported by geodynamical models nor geological proxies. Therefore, we interpret the inability of our up-to-date climate-carbon cycle model to reproduce Ordovician cooling as the existence of a missing parameter or a faulty influence of a present one. Accepting the veracity of the high Early Ordovician temperatures, alternative sources but also sinks of carbon must be considered. The contribution of the organic carbon sub-cycle and oxidative weathering of pyrite is currently not supported by proxy data. The impact of the colonization of land surfaces by non-vascular plants may help bring models and data into a closer agreement, but the overall impact of vegetation on climate remains difficult to quantify. Our simulations with increased topography did not intensify the Ordovician cooling, but note that the model used here holds large limitations considering the integration of relief and slopes. A more detailed analysis on this subject is necessary to draw any firm conclusions.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nChlo\u00e9 M.

The majority of the rocks contain detrital pyroxenes, \u223c48-52 wt.% SiO2 and <1 wt.% crystalline silica, strong indications that the provenance terrains exposed around the crater and in the crater walls are largely basaltic. A single 1-m thick interval of lacustrine strata (Czarnecki et al., 2020a) sampled with the \u201cBuckskin\u201d drill sample, contained 73.9 wt.% SiO2, including 15.6 wt.% crystalline monoclinic tridymite, 2.6 wt.% cristobalite, and \u223c54 wt.% high-Si amorphous material, with plagioclase, and minor magnetite (detection limit for crystalline minerals is 1 wt.%).\nThe unique composition and mineralogy of the Buckskin sample and high-silica interval inspired a series of publications and hypotheses about its origin. Tridymite is a high-temperature, low-pressure polymorph of SiO2 and was quickly recognized as a likely strong indicator of silicic volcanism, thought to be exposed in the rocks of the crater walls or central peak (Morris et al., 2016). Subsequent papers noted that the high silica layer could represent more distal lake deposits of a redox-stratified lake, where mineral sorting and redox conditions conspired to deposit amorphous silica and magnetite (Hurowitz et al., 2017) or the high silica may have been left behind by minor acidic diagenesis (Rampe et al., 2017). Recent work has suggested the measured locale could have formed from a hydrothermal fumarolic deposit (Yen et al., 2021). Understanding the formation and transport of tridymite has crucial geological implications regarding the environmental conditions at the time of its deposition.\nIn this manuscript, we revisit the mineralogical and sedimentological data at\/around the Buckskin drill site, with particular emphasis on terrestrial analogs for monoclinic tridymite and the recognition that this interval is unique in hundreds of meters of lacustrine stratigraphy. We ultimately concur with Morris et al. in the silicic volcanism scenario for forming monoclinic tridymite and introduce thermodynamical models showing that tridymite is a reasonable product of evolution of the same magmatic processes that produced other source rocks to Gale crater. The monoclinic form of tridymite is most consistent with an ashy eruption but not with a direct ashfall because Al2O3 is too low for rhyolitic glass, and no unconformities or changes in sedimentation style consistent with a direct ashfall from a novel source were observed. Given these observations and the purity of the single pulse of tridymite and high-SiO2 in hundreds of meters of lacustrine stratigraphy, we propose that the observations are most consistent with a syn-depositional ashy rhyolitic eruption that would have introduced an abundance of fine grained tridymite-rich material to the watershed of Gale crater, suggesting that a felsic explosive eruption occurred during the Hesperian. The Buckskin sample would be a distal lacustrine deposit, enriched in tridymite through sorting and in SiO2 through precipitation. An analogous site at Lake Tecocomulco, Mexico demonstrates the feasibility of such a scenario, with a \u223c2 m thick layer of lacustrine deposits enriched in tridymite and SiO2 but depleted in Al2O3 and mafic minerals after an ashy rhyolitic eruption \u223c60 km away (presumably Tl\u00e1loc volcano; Roy et al., 2009a,b).\n\n\n2\nTridymite detection in Gale crater\n\n2.1\nGeologic context\nThe Curiosity rover landed in the 3.8 Ga Gale impact crater, which contains a wind-exposed stratigraphic record in the form of a central mound called Aeolis Mons (Fig. 1\n). The lower part of the mound contains layered hydrated minerals that the rover was sent to investigate. The uppermost few kilometers of the mound have been proposed to come from volcanic or eolian activity, and are likely wind-blown dust or ash deposits (Thomson et al., 2019; Kite et al., 2013; Thomson et al., 2011). Textural similarities and low thermal inertia of the uppermost central mound and the Medusae Fossae Formation, thought to be a volcanic ash deposit and a large source of dust located \u223c400 km east of Gale crater, suggest that volcanic ash may have contributed to building the central mound (Thomson et al., 2011).\nDuring the first 750 martian days (known as sols), the rover traveled through fluvio-deltaic sandstones and conglomerates of the Bradbury formation (Fig. 1a\u20132\n). The fluvial rocks of the Bradbury formation contain detrital igneous minerals (sanidine, plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine) and clasts carried from mafic and trachytic provenances located in an ancient catchment around the northwestern rim of the crater with minor alteration indicated by phyllosilicate formation (Grotzinger et al., 2015; Le Deit et al., 2016; Siebach et al., 2017). Fractional crystallization of alkaline and subalkaline felsic magmas can explain the chemistry of detrital sanidine and plagioclase analyzed within sedimentary rocks and the compositional range of igneous floats observed on the crater floor within the Bradbury formation (Payr\u00e9 et al., 2020; Sautter et al., 2015; Udry et al., 2018).\nLacustrine mudstones of the Murray formation interfinger with the Bradbury formation and are exposed in overlying layers making up the first several hundred meters of Aeolis Mons (Fig. 1a\u20132; Grotzinger et al., 2015; Stack et al., 2019). The tridymite-containing Buckskin sample was found in the lowermost exposed member of the Murray formation, the Pahrump Hills member, which includes \u223c25 vertical m of strata (Fig. 2). Portions of the Murray formation along the rover's traverse are obscured by the Stimson formation, an unconformable eolian sandstone that was deposited above both the Bradbury and Murray formations at a much later time (Banham et al., 2018).\nThe Pahrump Hills member was observed in detail by the rover in two key localities, Pahrump Hills and Marias Pass (Fig. 1a\u20132). The Pahrump Hills member contains \u223c13 m of laminated mudstones and minor cross-stratified sandstones, interpreted to have formed from river-generated hyperpycnal plumes entering a lake (Stack et al., 2019). The sediments are dominated by detrital basaltic igneous minerals, secondary phyllosilicates and iron oxides, and amorphous materials (Rampe et al., 2020). The Telegraph Peak sample (Fig. 2), drilled near the top of the Pahrump Hills locality exposure, contains abundant cristobalite and an X-ray amorphous component with SiO\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n53\n wt.% compared to an average in the Murray formation of 49 wt.% (Fig. 2b; Rampe et al., 2020). From the Pahrump Hills locality, the rover drove \u223c500 m across a topographic depression to \u201cMarias Pass\u201d where the rover could access the Murray formation just below the Stimson unconformity.\nThe Marias Pass locality exposes \u223c4-5 meters of Murray strata, with a \u223c1 m thick conformable stratigraphic interval of laminated lacustrine strata with high silica content (>70 wt.%; Czarnecki et al., 2020a,b; Frydenvang et al., 2017) near the top of the exposure. No unconformities or visible changes in sedimentation style (such as those that would be expected from subaerial exposure or direct ashfall deposits) were observed throughout Marias Pass in comparison to Pahrump Hills, although the laminations were thinnest (\u223c0.5 mm thick) in the Si-rich interval, consistent with more distal deposition in a lake (Morris et al., 2016; Hurowitz et al., 2017; Rampe et al., 2017). The Si-rich interval was drilled at the Buckskin target and found to contain monoclinic tridymite and cristobalite as well as significant amorphous silica (SiO\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n75.9\n wt.%; Morris et al., 2016). The tridymite was interpreted to come from silicic volcanism, potentially originating from evolved trachytic rocks in the crater rim or central peak of Gale (Morris et al., 2016).\nThe final ten vertical meters of the Pahrump Hills member were not analyzed in detail by the rover because they were obscured along the traverse by the overlying Stimson sandstone. The next location above Buckskin with compositional measurements in the Murray formation was in the Hartmann's Valley member, which is a fine-grained cross-stratified sandstone interpreted as eolian reworking of lacustrine sediments (Rampe et al., 2020). The lowest-elevation Oudam target (Fig. 2) drilled from the Hartmann's Valley member has \u223c7 wt.% opal-CT and a particularly SiO2-rich X-ray amorphous component relative to other Murray formation samples except for Buckskin (64 wt.% compared to average \u223c49 wt.%; Rampe et al., 2020).\nThe distribution of silica enrichment throughout the Murray stratigraphy is not well constrained, but broadly there is some enrichment in cristobalite \u223c5 m below Buckskin, \u223c1 m of very high SiO2 at Buckskin, and relatively elevated SiO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u223c\n 10 m above Buckskin. The Telegraph Peak mudstone, located \u223c5 meters below Buckskin (Fig. 2a), contains cristobalite (12 wt.%) and plagioclase, but the composition of the amorphous component is dramatically different with 20 wt.% less SiO2 and \u223cfour times more FeOT in Telegraph Peak than Buckskin (17.1 wt.% versus 4.8 wt.%; Rampe et al., 2020). Despite the lack of compositional measurements up-section from Buckskin, the Murray rocks immediately above the high-silica layer show elevated but decreasing silica contents based on ChemCam observations (from 75 wt.% SiO2 to \u223c52 wt.% SiO2, ; Frydenvang et al., 2017). Ten meters above Buckskin (Fig. 2a), the Oudam's amorphous component contained more SiO2 than most samples analyzed by CheMin in the Murray formation, although \u223c10 wt.% less than Buckskin (Table 1\n; Rampe et al., 2020). Unlike Buckskin, Oudam does not have crystalline silica polymorphs, plagioclase is in higher abundance (52 wt.% versus 43 wt.% in the crystalline component Rampe et al., 2020), and hematite is abundant.\nAs of the writing of this manuscript, Curiosity has traversed over 380 m of vertical stratigraphy within the Murray formation and has not identified any other locations with either any crystalline tridymite or an X-ray amorphous component as high in silica content as that of Buckskin in Marias Pass.\n\n\n2.2\nComposition and mineralogy of Buckskin\nThe CheMin instrument onboard Curiosity measures XRD patterns of scooped eolian sediments and drilled rock powders (grain size sieved to <150 \u03bcm; Blake et al., 2012). XRD measurements on the Buckskin mudstone revealed the presence of well-ordered monoclinic tridymite and cristobalite, along with a Si-rich amorphous component likely containing opal-CT and opal-A and\/or rhyolitic glass (Fig. 2; Morris et al., 2016). The sample contains a significant Si-rich amorphous component (54 wt.%), plagioclase with an anorthite component An41(3) (19.8 wt.%), and monoclinic tridymite (15.6 wt.%), and minor sanidine with an orthoclase component Or77(14) (3.7 wt.%), magnetite (3.2 wt.%), cristobalite (2.8 wt.%), and anhydrite (0.9 wt.%) (Morrison et al., 2018; Rampe et al., 2020). As emphasized by Morris et al. (2016), the presence of all of the high-intensity diffraction peaks characteristic of monoclinic tridymite reveals the fully-ordered nature of the tridymite in contrast to opaline silica (Fig. 3\n; detailed in Text S1).\nThe composition of Buckskin presented in Morris et al. (2016) was measured by APXS (Table 1; Text S2). In contrast to other Pahrump Hills drilled samples, which contain SiO2 concentrations \u223c48-52 wt.% (Rampe et al., 2020), Morris et al. (2016) show that Buckskin is Si-rich (SiO\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u223c\n 73.9 wt.%), and depleted in all other major oxides, with only 5.7 wt.% Al2O3 (Table 1). TiO2, while low by terrestrial standards, is elevated at Buckskin compared to all other samples observed in Gale crater (1.57 wt.%, compared to average 1.0\u00b10.2 wt.%). Buckskin's X-ray amorphous component chemistry is calculated from the CheMin and APXS measurements, as presented by Rampe et al. (2020): the amorphous component chemistry is estimated as the excess elements measured by APXS after subtracting the crystalline component compositions as inferred by CheMin unit-cell parameters. This technique for determining the X-ray amorphous component necessarily relegates minor elements that are not structurally required for observed minerals into the amorphous component, as well as any minerals below the CheMin detection limit of \u223c2%. These limitations obscure the mineral host of the TiO2, so the TiO2 is partitioned to the amorphous component. Only 1.57 wt.% of a Ti-oxide would account for all of the TiO2. Morris et al. (2016) show that, consistent with the major occurrence of Si-rich materials (opal-CT and opal-A and\/or Si-rich glass), Buckskin's X-ray amorphous component is Si-rich (SiO\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n75.9\n wt.%), and depleted in all other oxides, especially Al2O3 with only 0.04 wt.% Al2O3 (Table 1).\n\n\n\n3\nFormation of tridymite\n\n3.1\nSilica polymorphs and metastable states\nSilica polymorphs including quartz, tridymite, and cristobalite share a simple formula (SiO2), but their crystal structures differ from each other, imparting distinct physical and chemical properties. Silica polymorphs can form metastable structures at temperatures outside of their stability field. In its typical stability field (870\u00b0C < T < 1470\u00b0C), tridymite is hexagonal, referred to here as high-temperature (T) tridymite, but various metastable low-temperature orthorhombic and monoclinic tridymite structures (< \u223c420\u00b0C) have been observed in natural and synthetic materials (Deer et al., 2013). These metastable structures form and persist when mineral cooling is rapid and there is insufficient activation energy to break chemical bonds to form a more stable silica polymorph like quartz (Deer et al., 2013; Dollase and Baur, 1976).\nAll known monoclinic tridymite samples, natural and synthetic, are formed during fast cooling by a series of phase transitions from the stable high-T tridymite (e.g., Dollase and Baur, 1976; Jackson et al., 2011). The sequence of phase transitions for tridymite is still not well constrained, partly because of the influence of initial composition, thermal history, and degree of structural disorders within the initial tridymite (e.g., Pryde and Dove, 1998 and references therein). Roughly, high-T hexagonal tridymite can be reversibly transformed to orthorhombic tridymite at \u223c420\u00b0C, which can be reversibly modified to low-T monoclinic tridymite at lower temperatures (<200\u00b0C; Kihara, 1978). All the forms of tridymite are distinct from the disordered structure of opaline silica (Fig. 3a; Eversull and Ferrell, 2008).\n\n\n3.2\nEnvironments where tridymite forms\nNatural monoclinic tridymite seems to be extremely rare on Earth and has only been reported in five locations. Four locations correspond to silicic volcanic complexes at Yugawa and Mt Myoho in Japan (Kawai et al., 1978), and in granophyres within the Skaergaard intrusions in Greenland (Larsen and Tegner, 2006). In these settings, tridymite crystallized from a hot silicic magma. Monoclinic tridymite grains have also been identified within impact-melt clasts in the Chesapeake Bay impact crater, Virginia (Jackson et al., 2011). While rare on Earth, monoclinic tridymite is commonly observed in extra-terrestrial samples including lunar basalts and martian meteorites (e.g., Dollase et al., 1971; Mason, 1972; Bridges et al., 1995; Xirouchakis et al., 2002). Synthetic monoclinic tridymite is made as refractory silica bricks, which are fabricated from fired quartz at \u223c1400\u00b0C (Schneider et al., 1980), from melting of silica and Na-tungstate at \u223c1400\u00b0C (Hoffmann, 1967), or from silica glass under hydrothermal conditions at \u223c1100\u00b0C (Nukui and Nakazawa, 1978). In all cases, monoclinic tridymite formed from high-T hexagonal tridymite during fast cooling. Text S3 and Table 2\n details terrestrial and extra-terrestrial settings where tridymite has been observed.\n\n\n3.3\nMagmatic crystallization modeling\nTypically, magmatic tridymite crystallizes from felsic magma, which is rarely observed on Mars (Sautter et al., 2016). Here, we use the MELTS family of thermodynamic models (Ghiorso and Sack, 1995) to explore magmatic conditions that could produce tridymite and other minerals found at Buckskin from martian mantle compositions. Since Buckskin is a sedimentary rock, the igneous minerals present might come from several provenances, but given the abundance of tridymite and lack of mafic minerals in Buckskin, the potential magma that formed tridymite is likely the major contributor. Previous work modeled the formation of felsic rocks including trachytes and diorites found within the Bradbury formation along with detrital igneous minerals originating from evolved magmas (Payr\u00e9 et al., 2020), here we investigate whether the same melts might form tridymite.\n\nPayr\u00e9 et al. (2020) used the crystal chemistry of the detrital igneous minerals of the Bradbury formation to identify a minimum of two magmatic pathways that could have produced the observed igneous minerals. Thermodynamic modeling of igneous-phase equilibria using alphaMELTS software (Smith and Asimow, 2005) showed that detrital sanidine and plagioclase from the Bradbury formation likely formed through fractional crystallization of trachy-andesitic and andesitic to rhyolitic liquids, respectively (Payr\u00e9 et al., 2020). Here, we investigate whether the same magmas would produce tridymite, cristobalite, and feldspar with the compositions observed at Buckskin using the models described in detail in Payr\u00e9 et al. (2020) and Text S4.\nWe ran fractional crystallization models at 0.2 kbars and oxygen fugacity \nf\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\n\n fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer FMQ+1 with H2O=0 and 0.5 wt.% with the rhyolite-MELTS model (Gualda et al., 2012) in the alphaMELTS 2 interface (Antoshechkina and Ghiorso, 2018), which is valid at <10 kbars for mafic and felsic magmas (Text S4). Feldspar, pyroxene, spinel, and tridymite are fractionated from magmas formed by high extent of melting of a mantle source (Fig. 4\n).\nFractional crystallization forms feldspar with crystal chemistries transitioning from plagioclase to alkali feldspar in late-stage of crystallization (Fig. 4c). Plagioclase composition ranges from An2\u221270, regardless of the initial mantle melt fraction and water content (Fig. 4a; Fig S1). Tridymite forms from late-stage rhyolitic magmas produced by fractional crystallization of magmas extracted at \u226515 wt.% of mantle melting. In one model, the tridymite simultaneously crystallized with a plagioclase composition matching Buckskin's (An12\u221239 and An41(3), respectively; 1 \u03c3 uncertainty from Morrison et al. (2018); Fig. 4b). These two minerals simultaneously crystallize, with up to 48.0 wt.% of plagioclase and 35.1 wt.% of tridymite, when 78 wt.% of a hydrous melt formed by 23 wt.% mantle melting has crystallized (Fig. 4c; Fig. S2).\nThe Buckskin sample also contained sanidine, an alkali feldspar. Alkali feldspar Or0\u221273 is favored during fractional crystallization of hydrous magmas with low-melting degrees (\u2264 17 wt.%) (Fig. 4a; Fig. S1). Although tridymite does not crystallize simultaneously with alkali feldspar, alkali feldspar could have crystallized in the same volcanic system that formed tridymite and plagioclase, the two latter being produced from a higher-initial-melt-degree hydrous magma (here 23 wt.%) than alkali feldspar's (here \u2264 17 wt.%). Higher fO2 values would favor the crystallization of tridymite, plagioclase, and alkali feldspar with compositions matching those of Buckskin's feldspars from a single magma (Fig. S3).\nAccording to the rhyolite-MELTS models, cristobalite never crystallizes. As discussed in Text S4, the absence of cristobalite could be due to the limited experiments producing cristobalite within the database used for calibrating rhyolite-MELTS (Gualda et al., 2012; Hirschmann et al., 2008). Hence, cristobalite might crystallize along with feldspar and tridymite from late-stage melts (Fig. 4), form from a high-T Si-rich magma recharged in the chamber, or be a vapor-phase.\n\n\n\n4\nFormation pathways for monoclinic tridymite at Buckskin\nIn this section, we review known and hypothesized formation mechanisms for tridymite to suggest the most plausible way(s) to form the monoclinic tridymite identified in the Buckskin sample. In order to be validated, the formation model must explain:\n(1) The amount and form of tridymite (15.6 wt.% monoclinic tridymite);\n(2) the mineral assemblage of the Buckskin sample including plagioclase (19.8 wt.%), tridymite (15.6 wt.%), minor sanidine (3.7 wt.%), cristobalite (2.8 wt.%), and a significant Si-rich X-ray amorphous component (54 wt.%), magnetite (3.2 wt.%) and anhydrite (0.9 wt.%);\n(3) the absence of quartz within the Buckskin sample and surrounding samples;\n(4) the composition of the Buckskin mudstone, particularly the low amounts of Al2O3 (5.67 wt.%) and other non-SiO2 oxides except TiO2; and\n(5) the geological context of the sample as a conformable laminated lacustrine mudstone.\nThe following subsections and Fig. 5\n describe pros and cons of each formation mechanism that could have led to the formation of monoclinic tridymite. A detrital origin is preferred based on: (1) geological context of Gale crater being a paleo-lake fed by streams and groundwater (Stack et al., 2019), (2) low-T mineralogy within the Murray formation, (3) preserved conformable thin laminae (0.5 mm) consistent with lacustrine deposition, without unconformity or change of sedimentation style that is expected from a lava flow or direct ashfall in Buckskin, and (4) low Al2O3 concentration of Buckskin amorphous component inconsistent with Si-rich glass.\n\n4.1\nLow-temperature processes\nWhile the geologic context of the Buckskin sample is consistent with authigenic precipitation of silica, low-T precipitation of any form of crystalline tridymite outside of its stability field has never been observed in natural samples or synthesized in the lab. The Buckskin XRD pattern displays clear monoclinic tridymite peaks distinct from opaline silica (Fig. 3a; Eversull and Ferrell, 2008). The only known way to form natural or synthetic monoclinic tridymite is through the formation of high-T tridymite. Without any further lab experiments, low-T precipitation of monoclinic tridymite is unlikely (Fig. 5).\n\n\n4.2\nImpact melt crystallization\nTridymite is a small proportion of the rock (0.3-5 vol.%) in the terrestrial Popigay impact crater and is found in a 5 cm interval within the core drilled in the Chesapeake Bay impact structure (Text S3; Table 2). However, these amounts are low compared to the quantity of tridymite within the Buckskin sample (15.6 wt.%), so it would be difficult to explain the high concentration of tridymite at Buckskin from an in-situ impact melt or an impact melt from which detritus was sourced (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the transformation of tridymite and\/or cristobalite to quartz is systematically observed in terrestrial impact structures (Text S3), which contrasts with the absence of quartz in Buckskin. Finally, the absence of an impact crater in the vicinity of Buckskin and the fine-scale laminated nature of the Murray formation are inconsistent with an in-situ impact melt. Although impact craters are common within and around Gale crater, the sedimentary record would likely preserve other impact signatures. The impact melt scenario is thus not favored.\n\n\n4.3\nHydrothermal alteration\nA hydrothermal formation process for Buckskin tridymite has been suggested by Yen et al. (2021) in which in-situ warm fluids circulate at the surface or just underground and reach temperatures high enough to form tridymite (>870\u00b0C). However, high-T alteration of primary minerals like feldspar present throughout the Murray formation would lead to a wide range of minerals including zeolites, phyllosilicates, and\/or oxides as observed in Kudryavy volcano, Russia (Africano et al., 2003) and Mount Rainier, USA (Table 3\n; Text S3; John et al., 2008) The diverse mineralogical assemblages expected from fluid temperature zoning have not been observed in Gale crater (Fig. 5). Instead, the Murray formation mostly contains basaltic mineral detritus and low-T minerals including smectite, and does not present significant mineralogical variability except for the Buckskin layer itself (Achilles et al., 2020; Rampe et al., 2020). Geochemical variations are relatively minor and can be explained by redox stratifications (Hurowitz et al., 2017) and\/or groundwater diagenesis (Rampe et al., 2020) without any need for elevated temperatures. Furthermore, temperatures from burial diagenesis in the crater are not expected to have exceeded 125\u00b0C (Borlina et al., 2015).\nTexturally, no features characteristic of fumarolic activity or hydrothermal alteration, like the opaline silica nodules from Gusev crater, Mars (Ruff and Farmer, 2016), colored layers\/patches (e.g., Getahun et al., 1996), or vents as observed within the fumarolic field of the Kydruavy volcano (Africano et al., 2003; Ganino et al., 2019), are identified within the Buckskin mudstone vicinity. At a larger scale, rover and orbital imaging did not detect any volcanic structures in Gale crater (e.g., Malin, 2000; Milliken et al., 2010). SiO2-rich light-toned fracture-associated halos were found around the contact between the Murray and overlying Stimson. If those was a conduit for hydrothermal fluid circulation, temperatures might be expected to be at their highest values in the fractures, but they do not contain high-T phases and are instead dominated by opal-A (Yen et al., 2021). The consistent thinly laminated fine-grained bedrock of the Murray formation (Grotzinger et al., 2015; Stack et al., 2019), with detrital igneous minerals and low-temperature secondary mineral assemblages (Hurowitz et al., 2017; Rampe et al., 2020), is more consistent with lacustrine deposition. Relationships with other potential hydrothermal signatures in Gale are discussed in Text S5.\n\n\n4.4\nMagmatic crystallization\nUnder low-pressure conditions, rhyolitic magmas can produce significant amounts of tridymite during cooling and crystallization (Fig. 5). Some extra-terrestrial samples contain up to 44 vol.% tridymite (Text S3; Table 2; Bischoff et al., 1993). On Earth, quartz commonly accompanies or replaces tridymite in natural samples, likely due to slow cooling (Dollase and Baur, 1976), or impurities like Na that could favor the transformation of tridymite to quartz (details in Text S3). The absence of quartz within Buckskin and other CheMin samples in the vicinity (Rampe et al., 2020) suggests rapid cooling of the magma.\nBased on rhyolite-MELTS models, tridymite and plagioclase in Buckskin could be late-stage products of the evolution of the same magmatic source that formed the plagioclase grains found in the Bradbury formation (orange\/yellow dots in Fig. 4a-b). Under specific conditions (0.5 wt % water, \u226521 wt.% partial melting; Payr\u00e9 et al., 2020), up to 53.4 wt% plagioclase and up to 35.1 wt.% tridymite crystallize from 21.8 wt.% residual melt. Crystallization of the sanidine observed at Buckskin requires a lower degree of melting or different fO2 conditions (Fig. S3). Therefore, sanidine and plagioclase\/tridymite either come from a different source, a different eruption from the same source, or all may have erupted together after settling for some settling time in the magma plumbing system. Spinel and augite crystallize simultaneously with plagioclase and tridymite but are not observed within Buckskin (Fig. 4c; Fig. S1). This discrepancy can be explained by the sinking of these dense minerals at the bottom of the magmatic system, while lighter, floating, feldspar and tridymite erupted. The unknown TiO2-bearing phase could correspond to either minor spinel, if incorporated below detection limits (\u223c2 wt.%), and\/or Si-rich glass. According to Kushiro (1975), Ti4+ and P5+ are polyvalent cations that favor the crystallization of polymerized minerals including tridymite and cristobalite in magmas, resulting in P-Ti-rich melts crystallizing abundant silica minerals compared to P-Ti-depleted melts. This is in agreement with the elevated TiO2 and P2O5 concentrations in Buckskin amorphous component.\nBased on the models, magmas are rhyolitic when tridymite crystallizes with SiO\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n73\n\u2212\n80\n wt.% (Fig. S4), similar to that of the Buckskin amorphous component, which is a mixture of opaline silica and rhyolitic glass. However, modeled alkali and Al2O3 contents would be higher in a rhyolitic glass than observed in the amorphous component (Fig. 6\n; Table 1). The Buckskin amorphous component has \u223c0 wt.% Al2O3 but natural rhyolitic glasses from nearly all recorded terrestrial igneous rocks have Al2O\n\n\n>\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n5\n wt.% (Fig. 6). Buckskin's composition is not consistent with direct sampling of a volcanic magma or ashfall, but can be explained by a detrital origin as suggested by Morris et al. (2016). Grain-size and density differences between minerals would affect their transport distance into the lake, changing the ratios between detrital minerals and potentially further enriching tridymite or leaving denser mafic minerals closer to shore. The dissolution of rhyolitic glass would create silica-saturated lakewater that would precipitate Si-rich products including opaline silica, which would dilute the oxide contents in the sediments. Dissolution of rhyolitic glass would also induce precipitation of Al-bearing secondary minerals; in an analogous terrestrial lake deposit, the Al minerals are observed in patchy zones within the Tecocomulco Lake sediments, Mexico (Roy et al., 2009b).\nFor all the reasons stated above, a detrital origin is consistent with Gale crater geological context, lack of volcanic features in Gale crater (Malin, 2000; Milliken et al., 2010), and Buckskin's texture and composition.\n\n\n4.5\nVapor crystallization and devitrification\nVapor-phase crystallization, which is the growth of crystals from hot gas streams within pore spaces, can occur at a volcanic vent during an eruption, when minerals precipitate from hot vapor. Devitrification is the crystallization of glass after emplacement of ashes. Tridymite can be a major SiO2 phase formed from vapor crystallization since forming at high temperatures and low pressures; at the Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, up to 8 wt.% vapor tridymite crystallized and was associated with little or no quartz in addition to plagioclase and alkali feldspar (Baxter et al., 1999). Such amount of tridymite is not sufficient to match CheMin observations in Buckskin and other processes are needed such as devitrification, which can produce up to 22 wt.% of tridymite in addition to feldspar, cristobalite, and Fe-Ti-oxides as observed in the rhyolitic Grey's Landing ignimbrites (Heled et al., 2022). Vapor crystallization of a Ti-oxide such as ilmenite has been observed in vugs in lunar basalts (McKay et al., 1972). An explosive eruption could thus explain the phases observed at Buckskin including tridymite, cristobalite, feldspar, Ti-oxide, and rhyolitic glass.\nAs discussed in Section 4, the direct deposition of ashes containing rhyolitic glass would result in an amorphous composition closer to that of natural rhyolitic glasses (Fig. 6) and would create an unconformity and a change in bedding style with a massive airfall layer, which was not observed (Morris et al., 2016). The deposition of ashes into the lake and watershed and subsequent transport and dilution of those materials, including by precipitation of opaline silica (Smith, 1998), could explain a depletion of other oxides, the presence of opaline silica in the amorphous component, and the thin laminae observed at Buckskin.\n\n\n\n5\nProposed model for Buckskin formation\nThe mineralogical assemblage sampled at Buckskin, specifically the 15.6 wt.% tridymite, high abundance of Si-polymorphs, and the absence of any mafic minerals like pyroxene, support a silicic source. The absence of quartz suggests that high-T tridymite crystallized from a magma or hot vapor phase and was rapidly cooled to a metastable monoclinic form (Fig. 5). Direct sampling of an ashfall or igneous deposit is inconsistent with the composition and geologic context of an extremely Al-depleted mudstone with conformable thin laminations (0.5 mm) in lacustrine sediments, so the tridymite is interpreted as detrital. The Si-rich, Al-depleted amorphous component and the uninterrupted fine laminations imply secondary addition of SiO2-rich precipitates in the lacustrine environment. Here, we describe the details of a proposed formation scenario for the Buckskin mudstone.\n\n5.1\nConstraints on timing of tridymite deposition\nThe stratigraphic context of Buckskin constrains the relative timing of the felsic eruption. If tridymite-containing rocks were eroded to form an exposed outcrop within the Murray watershed (crater rim or central peak), as suggested by Morris et al. (2016), a low, steady trickle or episodic pulses of tridymite would have been observed throughout the laminated Murray mudstone (e.g., Romans et al., 2016). This is not observed. Instead, the abrupt change in mineralogy compared to the Murray sedimentary rocks sampled below and in hundreds of meters above the Buckskin mudstone suggests a limited supply of silica polymorphs, which cannot be explained by a continuous erosion of tridymite-bearing felsic rocks. The decreasing SiO2 upsection (Fig. 2) broadly suggests a limited supply of SiO2-rich materials, although the \u223c7 wt.% opal-CT in Oudam, lacking from samples at higher elevations (Rampe et al., 2020), allows for some dispersion of SiO2-rich materials in the stratigraphy. This is more consistent with an influx of tridymite and silicic materials around the time of Buckskin deposition than with exposure of a distinctive rock in the watershed.\n\n\n5.2\nProposed scenario for tridymite deposition\nGiven these constraints on Buckskin's origin, we propose that a silicic ash-fall deposit containing tridymite, cristobalite, feldspar, Ti-oxide, and Si-glass settled into the lake and watershed of Gale crater during the Hesperian while the Murray formation was being deposited (Fig. 7\n). Erosion of a loose ash deposit would provide limited supplies of high-silica material for the streams to transport into the lake, thereby limiting the thickness of the resulting high-silica strata. Light fine-grained silicic minerals would be concentrated during transport to the distal portions of the lake, where they deposited as thin layers, suggesting that the percent of erupted tridymite was likely lower than the percent measured in Buckskin. Ashes of rhyolitic glass would be easily dissolved, and some tridymite and cristobalite would dissolve due to their instability in water compared to quartz (Dove and Rlmstidt, 1994; Robie et al., 1978), leading to the formation of a significant amount of Si-rich amorphous material including opal-CT and potential opal-A (Morris et al., 2016). The subsequent precipitation of amorphous SiO2 within the lake water or just below the water-sediment interface likely diluted the oxide concentrations of the overall amorphous component except for the enhancement of SiO2 content. The large amount of tridymite (35.1 wt.%) and plagioclase (48.0 wt.%) crystallizing from a notable amount of hydrous magma coming from 23 wt.% mantle melting (Fig. 4c) agrees with the elevated abundances of tridymite and plagioclase in Buckskin, 34 wt.% and 43 wt.% of the crystalline component, respectively. The elevated TiO2 contents in Buckskin compared to the surroundings (Fig. 2b) is consistent with tridymite-forming magmas (Kushiro, 1975), and is likely due to the occurrence of Ti-rich glass and\/or vapor Ti-oxides, as discussed in Section 4. As observed in other drilling sites in Gale crater (e.g., Vaniman et al., 2014), anhydrite in Buckskin likely precipitated in fractures following the lithification of the mudstone. Magnetite could be either a magmatic or a sedimentary product, as suggested by Morris et al. (2016), and could include minor TiO2. The influence of the SiO2-rich ash would have gradually decreased upsection as the ash eroded, with the silica polymorphs decreasing faster due to their instability, consistent with the opal-CT in Oudam and the decreasing SiO2 in Hartmann's Valley.\nKey challenges to explaining the Buckskin sample are (1) the lack of any observed change in lake sedimentation style, indicating that direct ashfall deposit into the lake was not observed by the rover, and (2) the compositional and textural requirement that Buckskin is not a direct ash deposit, so the mineral components must be detrital but dominantly silicic. Despite the lack of visual confirmation of an ashfall from the rover, an ashfall is more consistent with the relative purity and distribution of silicic minerals within the stratigraphy than exposure of silicic rocks within the provenance. A sudden influx of ash can dominate the fine-grained transported component in a fluvial-lacustrine system (Roy et al., 2009a,b). Even so, some catchment sediments could have been transported into the crater along with tridymite-bearing ashes, perhaps in volumes too small to be detected with CheMin (<2 wt.%). Pyroxene comprises 9.5 wt.% of Telegraph Peak, so a similar fine-grained component could make up \u223c10% of the sample at Buckskin without being detected. The decrease of SiO2 and the increase of other oxide concentrations within a meter above Buckskin (Frydenvang et al., 2017) support a relatively rapid increase in mixing between airfall and catchment materials. Similar mixing phenomena are also observed in Lake Tecocomulco, Mexico (Roy et al., 2009b).\n\n5.2.1\nTerrestrial analog for the proposed scenario\nThe dacitic\u2013rhyolitic tephra deposit within Lake Tecocomulco, Mexico, is a good analog for the deposition of pyroclasts within Gale lake (Roy et al., 2009b). Explosive eruptions deposited abundant tridymite, cristobalite, and plagioclase within the Tecocomulco lake and catchment, forming a 255-cm thick lacustrine sedimentary sequence (Roy et al., 2009b). Although the catchment contains mafic rocks (basalt\/andesite), no mafic mineral like olivine and pyroxene were observed within the cored lacustrine sediments. Tridymite and cristobalite are identified in amounts up to >30 wt.% in several drill core samples within the lake sediments. Quartz and amphibole are identified in a few samples but are not always present (e.g., dacitic-rhyolitic air-fall tephra layer and silty-sandstones with 10-20 wt.% quartz and >30 wt.% of tridymite and cristobalite, respectively; Roy et al., 2009a,b). Al-bearing halloysite precipitated in a few units within the sequence as a result of intense chemical weathering during the deposition of sediments, but again is not present in all samples (Roy et al., 2009a,b). Unlike the Tecocomulco sedimentary formation, no obvious airfall pyroclastic layers interstratified with the sedimentary sequence such as a coherent bedding were observed in Gale crater. Either such a layer is hidden and not observable along the rover traverse, or the pyroclastic material comes from the watershed only.\n\n\n5.2.2\nVolcanic source for the proposed scenario\nTridymite, cristobalite, and feldspar can form from magmatic crystallization within a rhyolitic liquid and\/or through vapor crystallization\/devitrification. An explosive eruption would have thrown Si-rich ash into the air to land in the Gale crater watershed and perhaps lake, depositing a tridymite-rich layer at Buckskin. The volcanic origin of the tridymite layer cannot be located, especially due to the lack of data to calculate the ash volume deposited in Gale crater and the surroundings. An explosive eruption on Mars from a stratovolcano or a caldera that then collapsed (Michalski and Bleacher, 2013) would generate hundreds-to-thousands km3 of materials, with an ash plume that can travel tens-to-thousands of km away from the volcano depending on various physical parameters such as the surrounding topography, enabling pyroclasts to be widespread. Apollinaris patera is a volcanic edifice located \u223c2,100 km away from Gale crater that was active in Early to Mid-Hesperian time and shows evidence of explosive eruptions composed of pyroclastic flows. It has been suggested to be the source of airfall depositions at the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), which might be related to the low thermal inertia sediments on the uppermost central peak of Gale. According to Kerber et al. (2013) and considering a significant eruption volume matching MFF volume, ash dispersal models of eruptions at Apollinaris would produce an ash plume that could cause 6.25 m to several hundreds of meters of ashes to be deposited in Gale crater depending on the atmospheric pressure. Although the eruption duration and the density of silica-polymorph and feldspar ash particles could vary from the models, deposition of pyroclastic airfall from a large explosive eruption occurring thousands of kilometers away from Gale is plausible, and could be amplified by eolian transportation from an ashfall to Gale watershed.\nA closer volcanic source can be also envisioned. Calderas that collapsed, which can be confused with degraded impact craters as suggested in Arabia Terra, can erupt thousands km3 of materials (Michalski and Bleacher, 2013) and could thus be the origin of the silicic layer in Buckskin. Despite the transparency of Si-polymorphs with infrared spectroscopy, thermal infrared and visible-near infrared observations can detect hydrated silica (e.g., Michalski et al., 2003), which was observed in the vicinity of Gale crater including within a delta in Garu crater located \u223c200 km east of Gale (Hauber et al., 2013). Hydrated silica can be formed through various processes (e.g., diagenetic), but the dissolution and transportation of Si-polymorphs and feldspar ashes from the watershed to the delta might explain these unexpected concentrations of hydrated silica. If such a scenario occurred, silicic explosive eruptions on Mars might be overlooked, especially due to the transparency of Si-rich igneous minerals with visible-near infrared spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n5.3\nImplications\nOverall, our proposed model is in agreement with a silicic provenance and a detrital origin of tridymite as suggested by Morris et al. (2016) and Czarnecki et al., 2020a,b. A thorough review of natural settings and thermodynamic models suggests magmatic and\/or vapor crystallization\/devitrification forming tridymite, cristobalite, feldspar, and Ti-oxide. Sedimentary observations argue against in-situ volcanics or hydrothermal alteration including fumaroles, and favor contemporaneous ashes falling into Gale crater lake and\/or watershed, enhanced by the precipitation of opaline silica. Based on observations in Gale crater, there was at least one instance of explosive silicic volcanism on Mars during the Hesperian. Such explosive volcanism in the Hesperian provides both compositional and timing constraints revealing that Mars magmatism was not restricted to mafic eruptions and crystallization of mafic minerals as suggested by Baratoux et al. (2013). Felsic magmas, potentially similar to intraplate melts on Earth like Icelandic melts (Udry et al., 2018), have formed on Mars from the Noachian (e.g., Sautter et al., 2015) to the Hesperian, and perhaps later on. Ongoing and future missions should seek evidence for additional evolved volcanism and additional constraints on the timing of volcanic eruptions; Mars is not only a basaltic world.\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nV.

Prior to gas extraction, no historical earthquakes had been reported in the area (Dost et al., 2017). Starting in the 1990s small magnitude earthquakes have been detected, with some of these shallow events causing non-structural damage and public concern (Fig. 1; Dost et al., 2017). As a result, it was decided to reduce production from 2014 on (van der Molen et al., 2019). The concern caused by induced seismicity at Groningen has prompted large efforts to monitor the seismicity and surface deformation induced by the reservoir compaction and to develop quantitative models of the seismicity response to the reservoir operations (e.g. Bourne and Oates, 2017; Bourne et al., 2018; Dempsey and Suckale, 2017; Dost et al., 2017, 2020; Richter et al., 2020).\nIn this study we take advantage of this rich dataset to explore different modeling strategies to forecast induced seismicity. We follow the well established paradigm that seismicity is driven by Coulomb stress changes (King et al., 1994), a view already adopted in previous studies of induced seismicity at Groningen (Bourne and Oates, 2017; Bourne et al., 2018; Dempsey and Suckale, 2017; Richter et al., 2020). We test different strategies to assess stress changes, taking advantage of a refined model of reservoir compaction constrained from production data and from surface deformation measurements (Smith et al., 2019). We additionally assume that the lag of seismicity is due to the fact that faults in this stable tectonic area where not critically stressed initially (Bourne and Oates, 2017; Bourne et al., 2018). Assuming the standard Mohr-Coulomb failure model, an earthquake nucleates when the Coulomb stress on a fault reaches a critical value that represent the fault strength. In this context the seismicity evolution depends on the shape of the function representing the distribution of excess strength, the difference between the initial stress and the critical stress at failure. We test whether the time evolution of seismicity reflects only the tail of that distribution, as assumed in the extreme threshold failure model (Bourne and Oates, 2017; Bourne et al., 2018) which explains well the initial exponential rise of seismicity, or whether it shows a transition to the steady-state regime where seismicity should be proportional to stress rate. Dempsey and Suckale (2017) were able to forecast satisfactorily the time-evolution of seismicity assuming such a steady-state regime but didn't model how it was established.\nHere, we treat earthquake nucleation as instantaneous. The nucleation process is in fact not instantaneous and this feature, which can be accounted for using the rate-and-state friction formalism (Dieterich, 1994), could explain the seismicity lag (Candela et al., 2019). We assess the effect of non-instantaneous earthquake nucleation in another study (Heimisson et al., 2021). The forecasting performance can be further improved with a more sophisticated representation of earthquake nucleation, but the assumption of an instantaneous failure is an appropriate approximation to forecast seismicity at the annual to multi-annual time-scale considered here.\n\n\n2\nStress changes due to pore pressure variations and reservoir compaction\n\n2.1\nPrinciple of our approach and comparison with previous approaches\nTo estimate the probability of fault failure, we need to model the stress redistribution due to the reservoir compaction and pore pressure variations within and outside the reservoir with account for poroelastic effects (Wang, 2018). The geometry of the reservoir is well known from various geophysical investigations (seismic reflection and seismic refraction), borehole core samples and logging data. The reservoir lies at a depth varying between 2.6 and 3.2 km, with a thickness increasing northeastward from about 100 m to 300 m. Numerous faults are offsetting the reservoir (Fig. 1) with throws exceeding the reservoir thickness at places. Pressure depletion lead to compaction of the reservoir, shear stress build up on these faults and deformation of the surrounding medium.\nVarious approaches have been used in past studies to calculate the resulting stress redistribution. Some have adopted a simplified model to enable forecasting seismicity at the scale of the entire reservoir as we do in this study. Dempsey and Suckale (2017) proposed a forecasting scheme which accounts for the effect of the local pore pressure change on poroelastic stress changes. They ignore reservoir heterogeneities and assume that the earthquakes occur within the reservoir. These model assumptions are questionable. The distribution of hypocenter depth, which were determined with an uncertainty of 500 m taking into account heterogeneities of seismic velocities (Smith et al., 2020), suggests that earthquake nucleate within the reservoir (28%) or in the overburden (60%), with the mode of the distribution peaking at the depth of the reservoir caprock. In addition, the earthquakes should tend to occur in zones of stress concentration induced by spatial variations of the reservoir properties. Bourne et al. (2018) developed a semi-analytical reservoir depth integrated model which is also limited to the estimate of stress changes within the reservoir itself, but account for stress concentration at the faults offsetting the reservoir. The faults characteristics are not represented in any detail though, and the reservoir compressibility is assumed uniform. Some other studies have used approaches that allow for a more detailed representation of stress concentration at the faults offsetting the reservoir and for the assessment of stress changes within and outside the reservoir. In particular, Jansen et al. (2019) used a two-dimensional closed-form analytical expressions to investigate stress redistribution and the possibility of reactivating faults with any geometry. Other authors have carried out similar investigations using two-dimensional finite-element simulations (Mulders, 2003; Rutqvist et al., 2016; Buijze et al., 2017, 2019). It provided important insight on the mechanics of fault reactivation, but the methods used in these studies to estimate stress redistribution can't be easily included in a seismicity forecasting scheme at the large scale of the reservoir due to the need to consider 3-D effects and the computational cost. Finally, some authors have adopted a simplified representation of the deforming reservoir as a series of point sources of strain (van Wees et al., 2019; Candela et al., 2019). This approach is efficient as the Green Functions are analytical. It allows to calculate stress changes in the 3-D volume and can feed a seismicity forecasting scheme easily. It however suffers from the fact that it is very sensitive to the number and distribution of point sources representing the reservoir and to the distribution of the receiver points where stress changes are evaluated. This issue is inherent to the point source representation due to the stress singularity at the source location.\nWe also use a Green function approach but adopt a strain volume formulation (Kuvshinov, 2008) rather than a point source formulation. The deforming reservoir is represented as a series of cuboidal volumes which are deforming poroelastically. We adopted a cuboidal elementary volumes as it is an efficient way to represent, to the first order, spatial variations of the reservoir geometry, due in particular to the faults offsetting the reservoir. These faults are represented as vertical faults but the method could be expanded to account for any fault dip angles using more general polyhedral elementary volumes. The displacement and stress Green's functions for polyhedral volumes are semi-analytical and therefore easy to compute (Kuvshinov, 2008). This approach has the additional benefit that the method makes it easy to compute the stress changes for any production scenario by the convolution of the Green's functions with the evolving pressure field. This is an appreciable feature for earthquake forecasting, eventually applicable in real-time. A difference between our approach and that of Candela et al. (2019), in addition to the strain volume instead of the point formulation, is that we assume that earthquakes can occur on unmapped faults. We therefore don't restrict the stress calculations to the set of known faults. The advantage is that our approach doesn't require any prior knowledge of the faults that could be reactivated.\n\n\n2.2\nImplementation of the strain-volume model\nWe use the pressure depletion model developed by the operator, MoReS (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, 2013), which was generated from history matching using the production rates, pressure gauge measurements, flow gauge measurements, and tracer timing measurements.\nSurface subsidence over the gas field has been well documented with different geodetic and remote sensing techniques including optical levelling, persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) and continuous GPS (cGPS). Smith et al. (2019) combined all these data to describe the evolution of surface subsidence and the related reservoir compaction from the start of gas production until 2017. They additionally used the pressure depletion model of Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (2013) to determine the spatially variable compressibility of the reservoir. Since the lateral extent of the reservoir (\n\u223c\n40\n\u00d7\n40\n\nkm\n) is much greater than the reservoir thickness (100\u2013300 m), the reservoir pressure depletion at any map point can be related to the reservoir compaction by:\n\n(1)\n\nC\n=\nh\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n where C is the compaction of the reservoir, \n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\n the uniaxial compressibility, \u0394P the pressure depletion and h the reservoir thickness. The uniaxial compressibility was determined based on the pressure depletion from MoReS, the reservoir thickness, and the reservoir compaction (Smith et al., 2019). Kuvshinov (2008) determined the semi-analytical Green functions relating compaction of a cuboid to surface subsidence by integration of the nucleus of strain solution (Geertsma, 1973) over the cuboid volume assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. Dyskin et al. (2020) recently questioned the validity of Geerstma's solution based on the fact that the subsidence is always smaller than the reservoir compaction by a factor \n2\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n)\n even if the reservoir is assumed of large horizontal extent compared to its depth. This paradox is discussed by Kuvshinov (2007) who demonstrates that this factor is due to the uplift of the reservoir bottom. The Green function of Dyskin et al. (2020) for nuclei of strain may however have a merit in the case of a very stiff underburden compared to the reservoir and could be used as a alternative to Geerstma's solution which assumes a homogeneous elastic half space.m Kuvshinov (2008)'s formulation depends on the relative position of the vertices defining each cuboid (i) relative to the observation point, \n\n\nx\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n=\n\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\nx\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\u2212\nx\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\ny\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\u2212\ny\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n=\n\n\nz\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n\u2213\nz\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\nx\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n, \n\n\ny\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n and \n\n\nz\n\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n are the location for each vertex.

(2019) we represent the reservoir with cuboids of \n500\n\nm\n\u00d7\n500\n m horizontal dimension. The depth and height of each cuboid is set to the average depth and thickness of the reservoir over this \n500\n\u00d7\n500\n m area.\n\nSmith et al. (2019) found that the uniaxial compressibility is pressure invariant and determine spatial variations of compressibility with a resolution approximately 3 km. Smaller-scale spatial variations of compaction, and hence of compressibility, cannot be derived from surface deformation due to the depth of the reservoir. As such the uniaxial compressibility model can be considered as a smoothed representation of the reservoir compressibility. Downstream applications of this model for stress calculations, Coulomb stress and earthquake forecasting should be smoothed to the same 3 km resolution.\nGiven that earthquake might nucleate within the reservoir, possibly in the underburden, or more probably in the overburden (Smith et al., 2020), the stress changes are evaluated both within, and outside the reservoir. We assume no pore pressure depletion outside the reservoir.\nThe stress changes are calculated with Kuvshinov (2008) solution with the convention that normal stress is positive in compression,\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\n\u2212\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n3\n\u2212\n4\n\u03bd\n)\n\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\n4\n\u03bd\n\u22c5\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ny\ny\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\n\u2212\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n3\n\u2212\n4\n\u03bd\n)\n\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\n4\n\u03bd\n\u22c5\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\n\u2212\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n+\natan\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\nz\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(12)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\nln\n\n(\n\n|\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n|\n\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n3\n\u2212\n4\n\u03bd\n)\n\nln\n\n(\n\n|\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n|\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\nz\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(13)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nx\nz\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\nln\n\n(\n\n|\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\nz\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\np\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(14)\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\ny\nz\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nm\n\n\nG\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nvertices\n\n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n[\nln\n\n(\n\n|\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n\n\n2\nz\n\n\nx\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\np\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n]\n.\n\n\n\n\nAll model parameters are listed in Table 1\n. The Biot coefficient is in particular set to \n\u03b1\n=\n1.0\n. Due to poroelasticity, the pressure depletion leads to a decrease of the horizontal stress. For a reservoir of large horizontal extent compared to its depth this effect is characterized by the stress path coefficient \nA\n=\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nh\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nP\n\n\n=\n\u03b1\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n. Because the vertical stress is determined by the overburden, it remains constant during gas extraction if the mass of the extracted gas is neglected. It results that the stress path is important parameters which determines stress changes in the reservoir (Hettema et al., 2000). Given the value of the Poisson coefficient, \n\u03bd\n=\n0.25\n, the stress path coefficient corresponding to our model parameters is \nA\n=\n0.66\n. For comparison, field measurements have indicated \nA\n=\n0.4\n\u00b1\n0.2\n and laboratory measurements have yielded values between 0.7 and 0.8 (Hettema et al., 2000; Hol et al., 2018). The displacement and stress fields for a single cuboid is shown in Supplementary Figure A1. The cross-section is taken along the y-axis in the center of the cuboid. Note the stress localization at the edges of the cuboid. The free surface has little effect in the case of a single cuboid due to its small size compared to the reservoir depth.\nThe point of failure of an intact rock or of reactivation of an existing fault is commonly assessed using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion (Handin, 1969). A number of studies have also demonstrated that this criterion can be used effectively to assess earthquake triggering by stress changes (e.g. King et al., 1994). According to this criterion failure occurs when the shear-stress \u03c4 exceeds the shear-strength of the material \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nf\n\n\n, which depends on the effective normal stress, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\n, according to\n\n(15)\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\u03bc\n(\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2212\nP\n)\n+\n\n\nC\n\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nf\n\n\n is shear-stress, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n is the normal-stress (positive in compression), P is the pore pressure, \u03bc is the internal friction and \n\n\nC\n\n\n0\n\n\n is the cohesive strength. If the material is not at failure the strength excess is \n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n. Pressure changes play an important role in preventing or promoting fault failure. Assuming the total stresses do not change, a greater pore pressure acts to lower the effective normal stress and promotes failure. By contrast, a pressure decrease should inhibit failure. It is customary to assess jointly the effect of stress changes and pore pressure changes using the Coulomb stress change defined as\n\n(16)\n\n\u0394\nC\n=\n\u0394\n\u03c4\n+\n\u03bc\n(\n\u0394\nP\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n)\n,\n\n\n where \u0394C is the change in Coulomb stress, \u0394\u03c4 is the shear stress change, \u03bc is the internal friction, \n\u0394\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n is the change in normal stress, and \u0394P is the change in pore pressure.\nA cross-section of the displacement and stress calculated with our representation of the reservoir as a series of cuboids is shown in Fig. 2\n. The figure also shows the \u2018maximum Coulomb stress change\u2019, defined as the maximum Coulomb stress change for all possible faults orientation, and a \u2018fault Coulomb stress change\u2019 defined as the Coulomb stress change on faults with a fixed orientation. The rose diagram of faults orientation (Figure A2) shows two dominant modes corresponding to strikes of \nN\n\n\n270\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nE\n and \nN\n\n\n350\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nE\n. Dip angles are steep typically around \n\n\n85\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, 2013). We consider one or the other fault orientation. The choice of any fixed orientation result in fact in only a rescaling of the Coulomb stress changes. The Coulomb stress changes are largest at the top or bottom of the reservoir in the vicinity of the most prominent reservoir discontinuities. The stress concentrations at the edges of the cuboids interfere destructively where there are no offsets between adjacent cuboids.\nA striking feature of our model is that the Coulomb stress change is mostly negative within the reservoir. Within the reservoir, the pore pressure the poroelastic effect can outweigh the pressure decrease and this effect has been considered to be major cause for the seismicity at Groningen. In fact, considering a 1-D reservoir model and the dependence on the effective normal stress \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nP\n\n\n, the Coulomb stress can increase for a decrease of the pore pressure only if the Biot-coefficient, \nA\n=\n\u03b1\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n, exceeds critical values which depend on the internal friction angle \u03d5 and Poisson coefficient \u03bd,\n\n(17)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n2\nsin\n\u03d5\n\n\n1\n+\nsin\n\u03d5\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the standard parameters we have chosen (Table 1), \n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n1.07\n so that the poroelastic effect in the reservoir cannot in principle exceeds the effect the pressure drop since the Biot coefficient cannot exceed 1. A combination of a small Poisson coefficient, a large Biot coefficient and low internal friction is needed. This happens with the parameters used by Buijze et al. (2019) who assumed a Poisson coefficient of 0.15, a friction of 0.6 and Biot coefficient 1.0. The critical value of the Biot coefficient is 0.83 in that case. We verified this by calculating the stress changes at the center of a reservoir of large spatial extent (see supplementary Figure A6).\nThe calculation using the cuboid approach is very efficient. For example, it takes 60 s to calculate the cross-section presented in Fig. 2 on a standard desktop computer with the code supplied in the Google Colab notebook. This section is composed of 8174 receiver points at 15 m spacing in X and Z dimensions, computed from the convolution with the 8174 cuboids.\n\n\n2.3\nComparison with other models of stress changes\nWe compare our results with the stress change calculations presented by Candela et al. (2019) and to those obtained with the Elastic Thin-Sheet (ETS) approximation of Bourne and Oates (2017).\n\nCandela et al. (2019) calculated the maximum Coulomb stress changes on faults offsetting the reservoir using the 3-D model MACRIS (van Wees et al., 2019). Their calculation shows an overall pattern and amplitudes of stress changes similar to the stress changes calculated with our model near the edges of the cuboids (Fig. 3\n). Note that our calculation cannot be made exactly at the edges within the reservoir because the mathematical singularity. The values are therefore very sensitive to the choice of the exact point of sampling. Similarly the output from MACRIS is very sensitive to the exact location of the point sources with respect to the faults. The comparison between the two models can therefore only be qualitative. Sampling our model near the cuboid edges exaggerates the fractional area of high stress change because the peak value is assigned to the entire sampling cell. If the calculation is made in the caprock above the reservoir, the stress changes are very sensitive to the distance from the top of the reservoir if sampled above the edges of the cuboids. The stress change calculated at the grid points above the centers of the cuboids is more stable, although much smaller (Fig. 3) but probably more representative of the stress change with the sampling cell.\nIn the ETS formulation, the vertical averaged strain of a reservoir with spatially varying thickness \nh\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n is expressed a function of the vertical strain, \n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n and reservoir depth, \n\n\nz\n\n\n0\n\n\n according to,\n\n(18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nx\nz\n\n\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nz\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(19)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nz\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\nh\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\nz\nz\n\n\n.\n\n\n In the ETS formulation the distribution of earthquakes in time and space is derived from the deformation of the reservoir due to uniaxial compaction and to the associated vertical shear strain resulting from the spatial variations of the reservoir elevation and thickness. It accounts for the effect of poroelasticity and for shear at the faults offsetting the reservoir. The earthquakes are assumed to occur only within the reservoir. For consistency with the study of Bourne and Oates (2017), the calculation is made with a Poisson Coefficient \n\u03bd\n=\n0.2\n, a friction angle \n\u03d5\n=\n0.5\n and a Biot coefficient \n\u03b1\n=\n1\n. In that case, failure is promoted both by the shear induced by the reservoir geometry and by the poroelastic increase of differential stress. In their implementation Bourne and Oates (2017) applied a spatial smoothing and filter out faults with offset exceeding some given fraction of the reservoir thickness offset. The two parameters, optimized to best fit the seismicity data using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo procedure, were determined as 3.2 km and 0.43 respectively. The presence of salt above the anhydrite caprock justifies thresholding faults with large offset relative to the reservoir thickness. Faults with large offset presumably juxtapose the reservoir against the salt and could be considered aseismic. The pattern of Coulomb stress changes within the reservoir, sampled near the cuboid edges and smoothed with the same Gaussian kernel is similar to that obtained with the ETS (Fig. 4\n).\n\n\n2.4\nStress sampling scheme\nKeeping in mind that the objective is to feed a seismicity forecast, different sampling strategies of the stress changes might be adopted. A natural choice would be to sample the stress field at the location where changes are maximum and assuming faults with orientation yielding the maximum Coulomb stress change (Fig. 5\na) or with a fixed orientation corresponding to one or the other dominant mapped fault orientations (Fig. 5b and 5c). These sampling schemes give a disproportionate influence of the very localized areas of faster stress buildup where the reservoir is offset by small faults, as is the case in the southern part of the reservoir, and the stress values are very sensitive to the details of the meshing. In fact, the seismicity does not match particularly well the known faults offsetting the reservoir (Fig. 1). A large fraction of the earthquakes thus probably occur on secondary faults that were not mapped and in areas of stress concentration not represented in our reservoir model. We take this as an indication that the reservoir model, although quite detailed, does not account for all the complexity of the reservoir geometry and for the heterogeneities of compressibility responsible for stress build up during reservoir compaction. We however tested these possible sampling schemes as described below and in supplementary figures, and chose as our reference stress model the solution obtained from the more robust scheme by sampling at the cuboid centers (Fig. 5d). None of these sampling schemes is completely satisfying to yield a realistic estimate of the stress changes at the exact location of where the earthquakes are induced, but we show below and in supplement that using any of them doesn't impact much the seismicity forecast, essentially because of the model calibration step. In addition, to avoid a seismicity forecast too tightly tied to the particular set of faults represented in the reservoir model, we apply a smoothing to the stress field using a Gaussian kernel with 3.2 km standard deviation. This particular value was chosen for consistency with Bourne and Oates (2017) and the resolution of spatial heterogeneities of compressibility. This is an ad hoc way to account for stress concentrations due to secondary faults or to small scale variations of compressibility not represented in our model. This procedure predicts a spatial distribution of earthquakes in better qualitative agreement with the observations than the other sampling schemes that we have tested, including in particular those shown in supplement.\nWe also tested different schemes regarding the depth of the sampling points. Fig. 6\n shows the stress changes at grid points coinciding in map view with the centers of the cuboids, and at various elevations relative to the reservoir. It illustrates how the maximum Coulomb stress change attenuates away from the zone of stress concentration where the reservoir is offset by faults both in map view and with depth.\nWe assume that the pore pressure in the domains above and below the reservoir is not connected to the fluid pressure in the reservoir. Fig. 6 shows similar patterns of Coulomb stress increase above and below the reservoir. The amplitude of the Coulomb stress change decreases above the reservoir and the spatial distribution evolves slightly, with a Coulomb stress change high in the south-west of the reservoir shifted to the north-east at shallower depth. The variations are small within the top 50 m of the reservoir where the distribution of hypocentral depths is peaking (Fig. 6). The time-evolution of the maximum Coulomb stress 5 m above the reservoir is shown in Supplementary Figure A4.\nGiven the similar patterns of stress changes at the various depths, we choose to tie the seismicity to a single reference elevation above the reservoir. This 2-D assumption allows to reduce the computation cost that would be needed for a full 3-D calculation. Given that the depth distribution of hypocenters peaks right above the top of the reservoir, we estimate seismicity rate based on the maximum Coulomb stress change computed 5 m above the top of the reservoir with the strain-volume model (Fig. 4b; with forecasting potential at different depths and different Coulomb models discussed further in Section 3).\nWe compare the maximum Coulomb stress change from 1965 to 2017 for the ETS formulation and the maximum Coulomb stress change calculated with our model at 5 m above the reservoir (Fig. 4). Although the two stress calculation methods significantly differ, the spatial pattern and the amplitudes of Coulomb stress changes are relatively similar.\n\n\n\n3\nRelating stress changes and seismicity\nStress-based earthquake forecasting requires some scheme to relate induced seismicity to stress changes. Previous Earthquake forecasting studies focused on Groningen have assumed instantaneous failure and a non-critical initial stress (Bourne and Oates, 2017; Bourne et al., 2018; Dempsey and Suckale, 2017), or non-instantaneous failure based on rate-and-state friction (Candela et al., 2019; Richter et al., 2020). In this study we aim at simulating the evolution of seismicity at the annual to multi-annual timescale. In a related study we show that the finite duration of earthquake nucleation doesn't matter at these time scales (Heimisson et al., 2021). We therefore assume here instantaneous failure. Below we test the possibility that the seismicity is consistent the near-exponential rise of seismicity rate due to the tail of the distribution, represented by a generalized Pareto distribution by Bourne et al. (2018), or has transitioned to the steady regime assumed by Dempsey and Suckale (2017).\nWe use the stress changes calculated from our model and the observed seismicity to estimate the initial strength excess, defined as the Coulomb stress change needed to bring a fault patch to failure. An earthquake indeed indicates a Coulomb stress change due to gas production equal to the initial strength excess before production started. This calculation requires some knowledge of the fault orientation, which is known only for a very limited number of earthquakes for which focal mechanisms could be calculated (Smith et al., 2020). Therefore, we make the calculation for the fault orientation that yields the maximum Coulomb stress change or the regional fault orientation. Because stress changes are calculated at a reference elevation, samples at the center of the cuboids and smoothed, this distribution does not rigorously represent the strength excess, but can be considered a proxy for it, which we use to estimate of probability of inducing an earthquake at a given stress change. In fact, we can only estimate the part of the initial strength distribution that is revealed by seismicity. The forecast requires a parametric representation of the part of the distribution that has not yet been brought to failure. The shape of that distribution depends in principle on the orientation of the faults and the heterogeneities of the effective stress tensor. For a homogeneous tri-axial stress regime and standard Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, the strength excess can be calculated assuming some distribution of fault orientations. If the activated faults have all the same orientation either because they correspond to a pre-existing tectonic fabric, or are optimally oriented with respect to the stress field, the distributions should be close to a Dirac distribution. In that case all earthquakes would happen at approximately the same Coulomb stress change. Our calculation shows a relatively wide spread of values. The spread of this distribution can result from the heterogeneities of initial effective stress, cohesion, friction, fault orientation, hypocentral depths and from the uncertainties in the stress change calculation. We therefore consider the strength excess as a stochastic variable. This approach is similar to the Extreme threshold Model of Bourne and Oates (2017) which assumes that the seismicity only reflects the tail of the failure probability function (failure of the faults with the smallest strength excess). According to the extreme value theory the tail of the distribution can be represented by a generalized Pareto distribution (Fig. 7\n) so that the failure probability function becomes\n\n(21)\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\nexp\n(\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u0394\nC\n)\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n relate to the mean \n\n\nC\n\n\nt\n\n\n, and standard-deviation \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n of the initial strength excess distribution.\nHowever, it is possible that the seismicity may have transitioned to a more steady regime in which case the representation of only the tail of the distribution might be inadequate. For each fault the distribution of strength excess depends on the probability distributions describing its orientation, stress and strength. Heterogeneities of stress resulting from variations of elastic properties of lithological origin can result in a Gaussian distribution of Coulomb stress changes (Langenbruch and Shapiro, 2014). The other factors of strength excess variability might be assumed, like the geometric effect due to the faults orientation, to be unimodal as well. If we assume that the initial Coulomb stress values on different fault patches are independent and identically distributed random values, then, by virtue of the central limit theorem, we may assume a Gaussian distribution of initial strength excess, as is expected in the case where the only source of strength excess is due to heterogeneities of elastic properties (Langenbruch and Shapiro, 2014). In that case the probability of failure of a fault at a location with a maximum Coulomb stress changes \u0394C is derived from integration of the Gaussian function yielding\n\n(22)\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nf\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\nerf\n\n(\n\n\n\u0394\nC\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n represent the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, representing the fault strength distribution. This formulation is shown by the blue line in Fig. 7b, with the initial Gaussian represented by the dashed blue line. As the Coulomb stress increases, the first earthquakes will occur on the faults with the lowest strength excess and so will provide information on the tail of the initial strength excess distribution. In that regime the extreme value theory implies an exponential rise of seismicity for a constant stress rate (Bourne and Oates, 2017). As the stress increases to a value of the order of the mean initial strength excess (\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n) the seismicity rate will gradually evolve to a regime where the seismicity rate will be proportional to the stress rate. If the faults that have already ruptured are allowed to re-rupture and if the Coulomb stress has increased to a value significantly larger than the typical stress drop during an earthquake, the distribution of strength excess will become uniform (constant between 0 and the co-seismic stress drop); the seismicity rate would then remain proportional to the stress rate. This is the steady regime expected an active tectonic setting for instantaneous nucleation (Ader et al., 2014). One important question for seismic hazard assessment at Groningen is whether the system has moved out of the initial exponential rise of seismicity. To address this question, we compare the performance of the Gaussian model describes above, which allows for this transition, and of the Extreme threshold Model of Bourne and Oates (2017) which assumes that the seismicity only reflects the tail of the failure probability function.\n\n\n4\nEstimation of model parameters\nHere we determine the best fitting failure function parameters relating the modelled Coulomb stress change with the observed regional seismicity. We use the catalogue of Dost et al. (2017) which reports earthquake locations since 1990, with a completeness of \n\n\nM\n\n\nL\nN\n\n\n>\n1.5\n since 1993. We separate the observed earthquakes into yearly bins, denoted as \n\n\nR\n\n\ny\n\n\no\n\n\n, where subscript y indicates the year and superscript \no\n stands for \u201cobserved\u201d. We select a training period \ny\n\u2208\n[\n\n\ny\n\n\ns\n\n\n:\n\n\ny\n\n\ne\n\n\n]\n, where \n\n\ny\n\n\ns\n\n\n represents the start year of training and \n\n\ny\n\n\ne\n\n\n is the end year bin. The start year is selected as \n\n\ny\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1990\n, where the magnitude of detection is consistently above \n\n\nM\n\n\nL\nN\n\n\n=\n1.5\n (Dost et al., 2017). The end year is set at 2012 and 2012\u20132017 is used for validation. The bounds of the uniform prior for the parameter optimisation for the Extreme Threshold and Gaussian failure functions are given in Table 2\n.\nPredicted earthquake rates are formulated using a non-homogeneous Poisson point process with the intensity function represented by:\n\n(23)\n\n\u039b\n=\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nP\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n\n\n where \u03bb represents an earthquake productivity per given volume and \n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nP\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n the partial differential of the probability function changing in time. This formulation contains three unknowns, \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\n\n, \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n2\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n3\n\n\n, which are assumed spatially uniform.\nFollowing Heimisson et al. (2021), we quantify misfit using a Gaussian log-likelihood function. The Poisson Loglikelihood Ogata (1998) is more commonly used. One issue is that it requires a declustered catalog to remove aftershocks. Heimisson Heimisson (2019) shows that Dieterich's model is actually valid even in presence of inter-event triggering so that it is actually better not to remove aftershocks and that, in that case, a Gaussian Loglikelihood is more adequate. The catalog of Groningen doesn't include many aftershocks apparently, so whether one likelihood or the other is chosen makes no significant difference. The misfit function writes,\n\n(24)\n\nlog\n\u2061\n(\np\n(\nm\n|\n\n\nR\n\n\no\n\n\n)\n)\n=\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1990\n\n\ni\n=\n2016\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u222b\n\n\u03a3\n\n\nR\n(\nm\n,\ni\n,\nx\n,\ny\n)\nd\nx\nd\ny\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\n where \nR\n(\nm\n,\ni\n)\n is the model predicted rate density in year i, where \nm\n is the vector of model parameters. \n\n\nR\n\n\ni\n\n\no\n\n\n is the observed rate in year i. Integration in Easting, x, and Northing y, is carried over the area \u03a3, because of the predicted seismicity rate can be equal to zero (\nR\n=\n0\n). During the training we sample the PDF (Equation (24)) using an Metropolis-Hastings sampler. After sufficient number of samples, hindcasts are obtained by selecting 1000 random samples of \nm\n=\n\n\nm\n\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\n\nm\n\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n at random and computing \n\n\nR\n\n\np\n\n\n(\nm\n,\nt\n)\n for \nt\n>\n\n\ny\n\n\ne\n\n\n+\n1\n.\n\n\n5\nResults and discussion\nIn this section we discuss how the observed seismicity compares to model predictions in time and space based on the stress change calculated with strain-volume formulation for the Gaussian and Extreme-Threshold failure functions. We consider predictions based on our reference stress model where the Maximum Coulomb stress changes calculated with the strain-volume formulation at the cuboid centers and smoothed spatially. To simplify the forecast and reduce the computational cost, we relate the seismicity to stress changes calculated 5 m above the reservoir top. We also show forecast based on stress changes calculated with the Elastic-Thin-Sheet model and on variations from our reference model. We show in particular that the forecast is insensitive to the choice of a particular reference depth (Supplementary Figures A4 and A5). We also consider the forecast obtained if no smoothing is applied to the stress field, if stress changes are sampled at the edges of the cuboids where they are maximum, or if the forecast is based on the Coulomb stress changes on faults with a fixed a orientation set to one or the other of the two dominant orientations observed at Groningen (Supplementary Figures A6, A7 an A8).\n\n5.1\nFailure functions and temporal evolution of seismicity\nThe observed time-evolution of seismicity is compared to the prediction for the Gaussian and Extreme-Threshold models, using our reference stress model, in Figs. 8a and 8c\n respectively. The differences between the earthquake rates derived from the extreme-threshold and Gaussian failure model are insignificant over the training period. However, we note that the Gaussian model predicts a longer seismicity lag with the onset of seismicity occurring three years after that of the extreme-threshold (Fig. 8a and 8b). We verified that given the magnitude-frequency distribution of earthquakes is well described by the Gutenberg-Richter law for a b-value of 1 (Bourne and Oates, 2020), both models are consistent with the fact that no seismicity was reported before 1990 when only earthquakes with magnitude larger than about 2.5 could be detected.\nInvestigating the temporal forecast across all the model with have tested by varying the sampling location of the stress field and using either the maximum Coulomb stress change or the Coulomb stress change calculated for the average fault orientation, we find little variation in the training logp value. All models perform similarly and also yield similar forecast over the validation period. The validation log-p is however best for the forecast based on the Coulomb stress change calculated 5 m above the reservoir (Supplementary Figures A8 and A9).\n\nFig. 9\n shows the distribution of Coulomb stress changes calculated at the earthquake location for comparison with the failure functions obtained from our inversion. The comparison shows that even with the Gaussian model the seismicity data constrain mostly the tail of the distribution. Some of the acceptable Gaussian models show a roll-over that would suggest the beginning of the transition to a more steady regime. In any case, the two model parametrizations yield relatively similar failure function in the domain constrained by the observations. These distributions depend on the input stress field and so the actual values of the stresses would be rescaled if another stress field is chosen as an input. A key point is that the introduction of a stress threshold provides a sound way to explain the lag of the seismicity response to the gas extraction. Another key point is that the stochastic distribution of this threshold can explain well the initially exponential rise of seismicity as initially suggested by Bourne et al. (2018). An alternative representation, presented in Heimisson et al. (2021), is to assume a population of faults below steady-state with nucleation governed by rate and state friction. In that case, a single stress threshold is introduced, which estimated to 0.17 MPa with a 95% of 0.07\u20130.18 MPa using the same reference stress model as in this study. For comparison, we get a threshold distribution peaking at 0.32 MPa with a standard deviation of 0.07 MPa. The two notions are however not equivalent as the threshold associated to the rate-and-state model of nucleation determines the stress needed for a fault patch to evolve toward rupture, while our Gaussian failure model assumes instantaneous nucleation. The distribution of the initial state variable determines the time distribution of earthquakes in the rate and state model.\n\n\n5.2\nSpatial distribution of seismicity\nWe compare here the spatial distribution of earthquake probability predicted by our models to the observed seismicity. We test the strain-volume and thin-sheet stress redistribution models, and the extreme-threshold and Gaussian failure models, leading to four predictions. Fig. 10\n shows the observed and predicted seismicity for various models in addition to our reference model. All these models were calibrated against the observations. We show only the prediction from the best-fitting set of parameters.\nThe Gaussian and extreme-threshold failure models predicts similar spatial distribution of earthquake probability, whether the strain-volume or thin-sheet formulations is chosen to calculate stress redistribution. Slight differences are visible though. For the thin-sheet formulation the Gaussian failure function yields higher probability of failure in the north-west of the reservoir region compared to the extreme-threshold failure criterion. When the input stress field is not smoothed and sampled either at the cuboid centers or at the cuboid edges where stress changes are maximum, the forecast in time is good (Figure A7), although with p-values not as good as what can be obtained with the smoothed stress field. They however make distinct predictions regarding the spatial distribution of earthquakes (Figure A7). They predict a very heterogeneous spatial distributions that don't match well the observed seismicity (Fig. 10). Because of the small catalog, we didn't carry out statistical tests, but we don't think would be appropriate to use such models for hazard assessment because there is no indication that the spatial heterogeneities predicted by those models are valid.\nIt should be noted that the best-fitting model parameters are significantly different depending on the choice of the input stress field and reference elevation. The Coulomb stress changes at the location of the EQs are probably underestimated in our reference model. This bias is compensated by the calibration of the model parameters against the observed seismicity. The procedure has merit for the purpose of probabilistic seismicity forecasting but the model parameters are biased.\n\n\n5.3\nAre earthquake nucleating in the caprock, reservoir or underburden?\nThe model accounts for stress redistribution withing and outside the reservoir with account for stress localization at the faults offsetting the reservoir. The importance of accounting for this process has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies (Mulders, 2003; Rutqvist et al., 2016; Buijze et al., 2017, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019). In agreement with these studies, we find that the stress changes are maximum at the top or bottom of the reservoir in the vicinity of discontinuities created by faults offsetting the reservoir due to faulting. The model is consistent with the observation that seismicity hypocenters tend to concentrate in the caprock. The seismic ruptures don't need to be confined to the caprock though, are they can expand both into the reservoir or into the overburden.\nThis view contrast with a number of previous studies (Dempsey and Suckale, 2017; Bourne and Oates, 2017; Richter et al., 2020) which have assumed that earthquakes were triggered within the reservoir due to poroelasticity. The seismicity data don't exclude that the earthquakes might nucleate within the reservoir. In that regard, it should be noted that our reference model predicts no Coulomb stress increase in the reservoir due to the choice of standard mechanical properties (Poisson coefficient of 0.25, Friction of 0.66, and Biot coefficient 1.0). Our model can however predict an increase of Coulomb stress in the reservoir for still realistic model parameters (\n\u03b1\n>\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03bd\n\n\n\n\n2\nsin\n\u03d5\n\n\n1\n+\nsin\n\u03d5\n\n\n). This condition is not strict however as it ignores the effect of the finite extent of the reservoir and spatial variation of its geometry. Most importantly we find that, once the model parameters are calibrated to fit the observations, the forecast is nearly identical whether the earthquakes are assumed to nucleate within or outside the reservoir.\nThe seismicity data make it improbable that earthquakes below the reservoir. Our model doesn't provide any explanation for this observation as it predicts a similar stress concentration in the overbuden and underburden. Stress changes are actually slightly smaller in the underburden because of the asymmetry induced by the free surface. One possible explanation would be that the fluid pressure in the underburden is more connected to the reservoir than in the caprock, which has obviously been an effective seal over geological time. This explanation is plausible because the Carboniferous shale-Slitstone formation in the underburden is actually the source of the gas that has accumulated in the Slochteren reservoir sandstone. In that case the Coulomb stress might have actually dropped in the underburden leading to fault stabilization. Another possibility is that faults in the underburden had a larger initial strength excess due to the larger lithostatic pressure (as in Buijze et al. (2019)), or to stress relaxation associated with dusctile flow of the shale. Finally, it is possible also that the shale and siltstone below the reservoir are less seismogenic than the anhydrite caprock. Laboratory measurements show no evidence that earthquake cannot nucleate in the underburden, although they point to a larger strength drop in the caprock that would be more favorable to earthquake nucleation there (Hunfeld et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThis manuscript presents a framework for stress-based earthquake forecasting of induced seismicity which should in principle be applicable in any setting where earthquake is induced by deformation of a reservoir whether due to extraction or injection. The framework requires some knowledge of the reservoir geometry and compressibility on one hand, and of the pore pressure evolution on the other hand. By representing the reservoir as a series of poroelastic cuboids, the stress redistribution withing and outside the reservoir can be calculated with proper account for stress localization at the faults offsetting the reservoir and poroelastic effects. The stress changes are calculated using semi-analytical Green functions. This procedure is computationally very efficient and can therefore be applied to compute stress changes at the scale of the entire reservoir over several decades with a sub-kilometric spatial sampling rate and a yearly temporal resolution. We use our method to calculate stress changes due to the reservoir compaction to feed an earthquake forecasting scheme. Our scheme is similar to but expands on the extreme threshold model of Bourne and Oates (2017); Bourne et al. (2018) by allowing in principle to represent the transition from the initial exponential rise of seismicity to the steady state regime where the seismicity rate should be proportional to the stress rate. We find that the Gaussian failure function, which we introduce to that effect, has in fact an only slightly lower validation loss than the extreme-threshold function. We find no evidence that the seismicity at Groningen has actually transitioned to the steady-state regime. Assuming a steady state regime therefore probably lead to an underestimation of the hazard level.\nWe find that the forecasting performance is similar if the stress calculation is based on the elastic thin sheet approximation (Bourne and Oates, 2017) or on the strain-volume method presented here. It is also independent of the chosen vertical distance from the top of the reservoir used to extract the stress changes. This is due to the fact that, in all these cases, the seismicity forecast is driven by the spatial distribution of the discontinuities of the reservoir and the time evolution by the pressure depletion history. The forecasting procedure seems therefore relatively robust to the uncertainties on the modeling assumptions. However, it is likely the forecast performance is satisfying because the seismicity has been relatively stationary. If seismicity had shifted to the underburden for example, it is probable that the forecasting performance of the algorithm would drop and that the model parameters would need to be reevaluated. In any case, one should be cautious about the interpretation of the model parameters and about the implications of a satisfying forecast. For example, the stress threshold needed to initiate seismicity in our model depends on the chosen elevation above the reservoir where the stresses are calculated and on the scheme used to sample stress changes or evaluate earthquake probabilities. A satisfying forecast doesn't mean that the particular choices made in the stress calculation or the failure functions are correct. As an example a forecast based on the assumption that the earthquakes initiate in the reservoir can be found satisfying, although the assumption might be incorrect. Similarly, the assumption of a steady regime might seem acceptable to forecast seismicity over a short period of time but the linear extrapolation that the assumption implies could be incorrect and the model parameters (the ratio between the stress rate and the seismicity rate) would be dependent on the period used to calibrate the model and would have little physical significance.\nThe procedures presented in this article are computationally effective and could be implemented into a traffic-light system during reservoir operations. It would also easily allow for data assimilation (re-evaluation of the model parameters as seismicity observations are collected).\nIn this work we have assumed that earthquakes nucleate instantaneously at a critical stress. We do not account for the finite duration of the nucleation process which can be described using the rate-and-state friction formalism and which has been used in some previous studies and could partly explain the seismicity lag at Groningen (Candela et al., 2019; Richter et al., 2020). These studies use the Dieterich (1994) model, that the earthquake population is at state of steady earthquake production before it is perturbed. This hypothesis therefore ignores that the system may have been initially in a relaxed state due to the low level of tectonic loading in the Groningen context. Some modification of the formalism, presented in Heimisson et al. (2021), is needed to account for a possible initial strength excess. Although we didn't present any such simulations here, the code supplied in the Google Colab notebook includes the possibility of running forecast with the threshold rate-and-state model (Heimisson et al., 2021).\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJonathan D.

When added to mantle rocks H2O significantly affects chemical and physical properties, including mineral phase relations (Iwamori, 2004), melting temperatures (Hirschmann, 2006) and electrical conductivity (Yoshino et al., 2008) and is implicated as a potential trigger of intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes (Omori et al., 2004). Silica (SiO2) crystallizes as a major component in subducted oceanic crust and sediment (\u223c10\u201330 wt%) (Irifune et al., 1994; Ono, 1998; Perrillat et al., 2006) and undergoes several polymorphic phase changes as the slab subducts to the core-mantle boundary (CMB). In the anhydrous system, stishovite, a dense tetragonal SiO2 polymorph, is stable in oceanic crust from about 250 to 1500 km, where it converts to an orthorhombic CaCl2-structured phase, hereafter referred to as \u03b2-stishovite, through a second-order displacive phase transition (Fischer et al., 2018; Kingma et al., 1995). The \u03b2-stishovite phase subsequently converts to seifertite with an \u03b1-PbO2-structure near the base of the lower mantle (Sun et al., 2019).\nRecent high-pressure experiments have shown that stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite may host wt% levels of H2O in their crystal structures (Lin et al., 2020; Nisr et al., 2020, 2017b; Spektor et al., 2016, 2011). Results from hydrothermal synthesis of stishovite in the multi-anvil apparatus (e.g., \u223c10 GPa, 350\u2013550\u00b0C) indicate several wt% H2O in stishovite based on thermogravimetric analysis of recovered samples (Nisr et al., 2017b; Spektor et al., 2016, 2011). H2O contents in stishovite produced in recent laser-heated DAC experiments have been estimated from observations of expanded unit cell volumes relative to anhydrous stishovite using a calibration based on measurements made at 1 atm (Lin et al., 2020; Nisr et al., 2020, 2017b). Based on unit cell volumes measured at high pressure in the experiments by Lin et al. (2020) this calibration predicts >10 wt% H2O in some cases, values that seem excessively high and call into question the validity of the calibration at high pressures.\nThese results are in stark contrast to those from earlier studies on stishovite hydration that found much lower H2O contents. Pawley et al. (1993) measured <10 ppm H2O in pure SiO2 and about 80 ppm H2O in Al-bearing stishovite synthesized at 10 GPa, 1200\u00b0C and suggested hydrogen incorporation coupled to Al3+ substitution giving rise to oxygen defects, e.g. 2Si = 2Al + Ov. Bolfan-Casanova et al. (2000) found very similar results between alumina-free and alumina-bearing stishovite equilibrated with hydrous melts (2\u201372 ppm H2O) at 15 to 21 GPa, 1500\u00b0C, with H2O content correlated with alumina content. Chung and Kagi (2002) synthesized stishovite from hydrous glass at 10\u201315 GPa (1200\u20131400\u00b0C) and found a correlation between H2O content and trivalent cations and measured a maximum of 844 ppm H2O. Bromiley et al. (2006) synthesized stishovite at 15 GPa, 1500\u00b0C under H2O-saturated conditions and reported 3\u2013456 ppm H2O in alumina free and alumina-bearing stishovite and discussed H incorporation in stishovite as a function of alumina content. Litasov et al. (2007) measured the H2O contents of stishovite synthesized at 20\u201325 GPa and 1200\u20131800\u00b0C and found that hydrogen can occupy 40% of vacancies created by incorporation of Al3+ at 20 GPa, reporting values of <30 ppm in Al-free stishovite and up to \u223c3000 ppm in stishovite with 4.4 wt% Al2O3. All of these studies were performed in multi-anvil apparatus under nominally H2O saturated conditions, with sample water contents measured by FTIR on P-T quenched samples. In contrast, Panero et al. (2003) used the laser-heated diamond anvil cell to synthesize stishovite in a basalt composition with 0.2 wt% H2O in the bulk at pressures of 28\u201360 GPa and up to 4000\u00b0C and measured maximum water contents of 500 ppm using synchrotron FTIR on P-T quenched samples.\nIt is challenging to understand how different studies can produce such widely disparate results, with differences of the order several orders of magnitude for the H2O capacity of stishovite. One commonality among previous studies finding low H2O in stishovite is that H2O contents were measured on P-T quenched samples at ambient conditions (e.g., 1 atm, \u223c300 K). For example, Lin et al. (2020) showed that upon decompression from high pressure, the difference in unit cell volume observed at high pressure diminishes below about 10 GPa, approaching the anhydrous volume (see Supplementary Material for further discussion). Fig. 1\n shows measured unit cell volumes at 1 atm, 300 K, for pressure-temperature quenched hydrous stishovite synthesized in the experiments of Spektor et al. (2011, 2016) and Nisr et al. (2017b) in the multi-anvil apparatus compared to measurements of anhydrous stishovite. The hydrous stishovite data show a wide range in unit cell volume for samples synthesized at nominally similar conditions, sometimes overlapping cell volumes of anhydrous stishovite, other times showing large volume excesses. Also shown on Fig. 1 is the even larger range in unit cell volumes found in the DAC experiments of Nisr et al. (2020) measured on samples decompressed to ambient conditions.\nConsidering all these disparate observations, currently the extent of H2O solubility in dense SiO2 polymorphs at high pressure and temperature and the mechanism of H2O incorporation remains highly uncertain. To further investigate H2O incorporation in high-pressure SiO2 polymorphs we combine in-situ laser heating and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements with first-principles theoretical calculations to constrain the phase relations and H2O storage capacity (e.g., H2O content at saturation) of stishovite, \u03b2-stishovite and seifertite at 44\u2013152 GPa and \u223c1380\u20133300 K.\n\n\n2\nMaterials and methods\n\n2.1\nStarting materials and experimental design\nStarting materials with H2O contents of 0.5 wt% (experiment S_241), 1.2 wt% (S_242) and 3.5 wt% (C_188) were synthesized as mixtures of amorphous SiO2 (1 \u03bcm grain size, purity 99.999%) and silic acid (SiO\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\nO, 15.2 wt% H2O) in calculated proportions and ground in an agate mortar for 4\u20136 hours. The starting material with 15.2 wt% H2O was only silicic acid (experiments C_283 and C_154R). About 10 wt% amorphous Pt or Au powder was added to the mixture for infrared laser absorption and pressure calibration in laser heating experiments.\nSamples were loaded into symmetric diamond anvil cells. In experiments S_241, S_242 and C_188 samples were loaded in a 120 \u03bcm diameter hole in a rhenium gasket indented by diamond anvils with 250 \u03bcm diameter culets. In experiment C_283, the sample was loaded in a 100 \u03bcm diameter hole in a rhenium gasket indented by diamond anvils with 200 \u03bcm diameter culets. In experiment C_154R, the sample was loaded in a 45 \u03bcm diameter hole in a rhenium gasket indented by diamond anvils with 90 \u03bcm diameter culets beveled from 400 \u03bcm culets. Except for sample C_283 with Au powder, the other four samples were mixed with Pt black. Pressures were determined before and after heating by the self-consistent equations of state (EOS) of Pt or Au (Fei et al., 2007), and the uncertainty in calibrated pressure is estimated to be of the order 1 to 2 GPa.\n\n\n2.2\nHigh pressure-temperature experiments and in situ X-ray diffraction\nDiamond anvil cell samples were laser-heated and examined in situ at high pressures and temperatures by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction at the High Pressure Collaborative Access Team (HPCAT) beamline (16-ID-B) of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory and at the BL15U1 beamline, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China. The diameter of the laser heating spot was typically 20 to \u223c30 \u03bcm in the flat top area created with a focused yttrium lithium fluoride laser using a double-sided geometry that minimizes both radial and axial temperature gradients. Samples were heated at each temperature typically for 10 to 15 minutes. Temperatures were determined by fitting the thermal radiation from the central portion of the heated spot to the Planck radiation function (Meng et al., 2006; Hirao et al., 2020) with precision of individual measurements of <10 K and overall uncertainty of quoted temperatures considering accuracy and temperature fluctuations during heating of \u223c50\u2013100 K.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired at each pressure both at high temperature and after quenching to ambient temperature (see Supplementary Material Fig. 1 for example diffraction patterns). Monochromatic X-rays with a wavelength of 0.4066 \u00c5 at HPCAT (2.9\u00d75.4 \u03bcm2 beam size) and 0.6199 \u00c5 at SSRF (1.0\u00d73.0 \u03bcm2 beam size) were aligned with the laser heated spot for powder diffraction measurements. Sample to detector distance was calibrated using a CeO with calibrant and samples aligned to the center of rotation. At HPCAT, the diffraction patterns are recorded with a Pilatus 1M detector with typical exposure time of 10\u201315 seconds. At SSRF, the diffraction patterns were collected with a MAR345 CCD detector with exposure time of 60 seconds. All the diffraction data were reduced to 2-theta versus intensity using the Dioptas software (Prescher and Prakapenka, 2015).\n\n\n2.3\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations\nIncorporation of water in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite was simulated using density functional theory with CASTEP and CP2K codes. Relaxations were performed as function of pressure at zero temperature (static) and first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) at high temperature. We used supercells containing different hydrogen contents and in various configurations.\nCalculations for hydration of stishovite at 50 GPa and zero kelvin were performed using CASTEP (Clark et al., 2005) and a PBE-GGA exchange-correlation potential with an on-the-fly pseudo potential with a cut-off energy of 520 eV. Different supercell sizes were used to fit the related water contents (see Table S2). The water molecule was placed within the channels that run parallel to the crystallographic z-axis in the stishovite unit cell and, to test the range of possible substitutions, the molecule was located at three different initial positions each with three different initial orientations before the simulation cell was relaxed, with the constraint that the space group was maintained in each case to represent a mean field tetragonal structure. We found that the lowest energy configurations were those in which the molecule was centered within the octahedral interstitial site, with only very small differences in energies (\u223c3 meV\/atom) of the relaxed cells for orientations of O-H bonds parallel to x-, y- and z-axes. The average unit cell volume defined by the three different orientations was used as a representative of that of hydrous stishovite with (potentially) orientationally disordered interstitial water molecule centered on the channel interstitial site. Four different water contents were simulated, corresponding to supercells of 3\u00d73\u00d73 (0.55 wt.% H2O), 2\u00d72\u00d73 (1.23 wt.% H2O), 1\u00d73\u00d73 (1.64 wt.% H2O) and 1\u00d72\u00d73 (2.43 wt.% H2O) each containing one interstitial water molecule. We also simulated incorporating hydrogen in stishovite by substituting 4H+ for Si4+ (\u2018hydrogarnet\u2019 substitution), and in contrast to the interstitial substitution, found that the unit cell volume decreases by 0.17% relative to dry stishovite.\nHigh temperature and pressure unit cell volumes for hydration of stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite were performed using NPT first-principles molecular dynamics with flexible cells (constant stress) within DFT using the CP2K code. Simulations were at least 10,000 time steps with time increments of 0.5 or 1 fs. The DF2 non-local wan der Waals exchange-correlation functional was used. Simulations were performed at 35, 70, 100 and 135 GPa at \u223c300 K to 2200 K. We simulated interstitial substitution with one H2O in a cell with 165 atoms (54SiO2:H2O), inter-crystalline substitution (2H\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\u2192\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\n\nSi\n\n\n4\n+\n\n\n) with 2H+ in a cell with 162 atoms (53SiO2:H2O), and the \u2018hydrogarnet\u2019 substitution (4H\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nSi\n\n\n4\n+\n\n\n) in a cell with 165 atoms (53SiO2:2H2O). Anhydrous SiO2 was simulated using a cell with 162 atoms (54 SiO2). Results are provided in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nUnit cell parameters of SiO2 phases are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. We compared measured cell volumes in the system SiO2-H2O to the calculated cell volumes of anhydrous silica phases at each pressure and temperature using appropriate thermal equations of state (EoS) (Andrault et al., 2003; Fischer et al., 2018; Grocholski et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2019) to calculate the percent relative change in unit cell volume:\n\n(1)\n\n\u0394\nV\n\/\n\n\nV\n\n\ndry\n\n\n%\n=\n(\n\n\nV\n\n\nhydrous\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nV\n\n\ndry\n\n\n)\n\/\n\n\nV\n\n\ndry\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n Consistent with previous studies in the SiO2-H2O system, diffraction patterns obtained at high pressure and temperature or at high pressure but quenched to ambient temperature (\u223c300 K) reveal significant volume expansion for stishovite (up to \u223c6.9%) and \u03b2-stishovite (up to \u223c5.1%) (Lin et al., 2020; Nisr et al., 2020, 2017a), and we observe lesser but still positive volume expansion in seifertite (\u223c1.1\u20131.7%). These large relative volume expansions are attributed to the incorporation of H2O in some form in the structures of the SiO2 phases.\n\n3.1\nThe H2O storage capacity of stishovite: experimental constraints\nWe establish the magnitude of the H2O storage capacity through a series of experiments with varying H2O contents in the starting compositions at near constant pressure and temperature (\u223c50 \u00b16 GPa and \u223c1800 \u00b170 K) where stishovite is observed to be the stable polymorph. In principle, incorporation of H2O will cause a systematic change in unit cell volume at constant pressure and temperature but once a phase reaches H2O saturation its unit cell volume will remain constant even as the bulk system H2O content increases. As shown on Fig. 2\n, we observe a linear relationship between the volume change of stishovite up to \u223c3.5 wt% H2O in the starting material. In our starting composition with the highest water content of 15.2 wt% H2O, chosen to be very high to assure H2O saturation, we find effectively the same maximum relative volume change of \u223c6.5% as in experiments with 3.5% H2O, indicating stishovite is saturated at \u223c3.5% wt% H2O at \u223c50 GPa and 1800 K.\n\n\n3.2\nH2O incorporation mechanisms in high pressure SiO2 phases: ab initio calculations\nThe H2O incorporation mechanism is unknown from diffraction measurements and there are many potential substitution mechanisms that may operate simultaneously. We test three candidates for producing the observed unit cell volume systematics observed in Fig. 1: (1) the \u201chydrogarnet\u201d substitution where four hydrogen atoms substitute for a silicon atom, 4H\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nSi\n\n\n4\n+\n\n\n, which has been suggested as a stishovite hydration mechanism (Nisr et al., 2020, 2017b; Spektor et al., 2011); (2) incorporation of H2O through inter-crystalline substitution (2H\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n\u2192\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\n+\n\n\nSi\n\n\n4\n+\n\n\n); (3) incorporation of interstitial H2O in the stishovite lattice (SiO\n\n\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nx\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\nO). We use density functional theory (DFT) combined with molecular dynamics calculations to determine the effect of these substitutions on unit cell volume at pressures and temperatures ranging from 35 to 135 GPa and 0 to \u223c2200 K (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nFig. 2b compares the volume changes predicted in DFT calculations with the experimental results. The hydrogarnet substitution produces a small volume change, in good agreement with previous calculations (Nisr et al., 2020), but much less than observed in our experiments. Similarly, inter-crystalline substitution of H2O produces a small negative volume change at 300 K. In contrast, the large change in volume predicted for interstitial substitution of H2O at 50 GPa, 0 K, closely approximates the trend of our experimental data. On this basis we use our DFT molecular dynamics results for interstitial H2O substitution to calibrate the minimum H2O contents in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite in our experiments. Caracas and Panero (2017) suggested that hydrogen diffusion in ringwoodite may occur through a hydrogarnet substitution mechanism. In our FPMD simulations at 2000 K and 35 GPa, we find no diffusion of H in interstitial H2O over our 10 ps simulations, nor do we find such in the hydrogarnet substitutions. In addition, we do not anticipate that quantum effects will play a large role in hydrous stishovite.\nTo further test the veracity of the interstitial substitution model and calibration, we estimated the expected volume expansion in stishovite by adding together the volume of anhydrous stishovite at \u223c50 GPa and 300 K with the ice VII volume at the same pressure and temperature using its EoS (Wolanin et al., 1997). If H2O is incorporated into stishovite as an interstitial H2O molecule its stable phase is ice VII at 300 K, and to first order their additive volumes may approximate the effect of interstitial incorporation of H2O. The results are plotted on Fig. 2b (cyan diamonds) and, remarkably, we observe a nearly one-to-one correlation between the predicted H2O content using the ice VII EoS and those for interstitial substitution based on our ab initio calculations. This consistency further supports that the large volume excesses we observe result primarily through interstitial incorporation of molecular H2O at high pressure.\n\n\n3.3\nAn H2O in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite calibration based on interstitial substitution\nWe regressed the H2O content in the sixteen DFT data points to a simple linear function of relative volume change (\u0394V\/\n\n\nV\n\n\ndry\n\n\n%\n), pressure and temperature. We find no statistically relevant pressure or temperature effects (see Supplementary Table 3), and the concentration of H2O (CH2O) is well-fitted over the entire P-T range only as a function of the relative volume change:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n\u00a0(wt%)\n=\n0.5334\n\u00d7\n(\n\u0394\nV\n\/\n\n\nV\n\n\ndry\n\n\n%\n)\n+\n0.0124\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.99\n)\n\n\n Because other substitution mechanisms have only a relatively minor effect on unit cell volume, the H2O contents calculated based on interstitial substitution alone is a minimum because other substitution mechanisms may still operate but be hidden with respect to volume change.\nOur ab initio calculations show that the volume change for interstitial H2O substitution mimics closely the observed volume changes in our experiments at high pressure and temperature with known bulk water contents (Fig. 2b). Therefore, based on our DFT calibration we predict the water content in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite in our experiments from their relative volume changes using equation (2), with results tabulated in Supplementary Table 2. Equation (2) is not valid for seifertite, and although we observe a generally smaller but positive relative volume change for seifertite indicating some H2O storage capacity, likely in the range of 1 wt% or less, we currently cannot accurately assess its H2O content.\nIn the study of Lin et al. (2020) the water content of hydrous stishovite was estimated using the 1 atmosphere, 300 K calibration of Nisr et al. (2017b). The calibration of Nisr et al. was developed on the basis of hydrous stishovite synthesized in experiments by Spektor et al. (2016) in the multi-anvil apparatus under hydrothermal conditions (\u223c10 GPa, 350\u2013550\u00b0C). Nisr et al. fit a linear relation to the observed volume change (Vhydrous-Vdry) and the water contents of stishovite. Based on our new results we find that applying the Nisr et al. calibration for our experiments and using volume data at high pressures and temperatures is not appropriate. For example, application of the Nisr et al. calibration to our hydrous stishovite synthesized in this study at 53 GPa (C_188) yields \u223c13 wt% water, which is more than three times the water content in the starting material. Supplementary Table 4 gives the water content of hydrous stishovite in experiments reported by Lin et al. (2020) using the ab initio calibration developed in this study compared to values calculated using the Nisr et al. (2017b) calibration. We find that the water contents are systematically overestimated by nearly a factor of four in the study of Lin et al. (2020).\n\n\n3.4\nThe effects of H2O on phase relations\nHaving established that the starting mixture with 15.2 wt.% H2O has far more H2O than required to saturate SiO2, we now present results for the effect of pressure and temperature on the phase relations at H2O-saturated conditions. As shown on Fig. 3\n, the phase transition boundaries at high temperature under H2O-saturated conditions were bracketed between stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite at \u223c75 GPa and between \u03b2-stishovite and seifertite at \u223c145 GPa.\nThe stishovite to \u03b2-stishovite transition results in a small but abrupt decrease in c\/a axial ratio as tetragonal stishovite distorts to orthorhombic \u03b2-stishovite, whereas the transition to the seifertite structure results in a large increase (Fig. 3b). The transition boundary between stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite in our experiments is not significantly shifted from the dry silica system (e.g., \u223c74 GPa and \u223c1900 K) (Fischer et al., 2018), consistent with our observation that stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite have approximately the same H2O content at the transition. We estimate the transition to seifertite at a pressure of \u223c145 GPa, about 20 GPa higher than in the dry system (Sun et al., 2019), suggesting a larger H2O capacity in \u03b2-stishovite than in seifertite, although we do not have a tight constraint on the phase boundary.\nIn contrast to our results, Nisr et al. (2020) observe that the stishovite to \u03b2-stishovite transition occurs at much lower pressure in the SiO2-H2O system and that there is a large pressure range over which these two phases coexist (e.g., the phase transition becomes first order rather than second-order as in the anhydrous system). Experiments reported by Nisr et al. (2020) contain either a mixture of stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite or just \u03b2-stishovite. As shown on the example diffraction patterns in Figure S1 and exhibited by the abrupt changes in axial ratios in Fig. 3, in our study we do not find compelling evidence for co-existence of stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite. We do not have a good explanation for these different observations and more work is needed to determine the effect of H2O on the phase transition. However, we note that what is apparent and consistent in both studies is that stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite each contain wt% levels of H2O at saturation, and our results indicate that across the transition there is no statistically significant change in H2O storage capacity. We also did not detect SiO2 in the NiAs-type structure at pressures above \u223c60 GPa as in Nisr et al. (2020).\n\n\n3.5\nThe effects of pressure and temperature on H2O storage capacity\nOn the basis of calibrated H2O contents in experiments with 15.2 wt% H2O in the starting composition (e.g., saturated), we can now assess if there is a discernable effect of pressure and\/or temperature on H2O storage capacity. In run C_283 experiments were made at pressures of 48\u2013102 GPa and temperatures of \u223c1300\u20132200 K, and in run C_154R at 97\u2013152 GPa and \u223c1850\u20134100 K. The observed relative volume changes obtained from high-pressure and high-temperature diffraction and the corresponding H2O contents are provided in Supplementary Table 2. H2O contents as a function of pressure and temperature are shown in Fig. 4\n. The data indicate generally smaller volume changes and lower H2O contents in the higher-pressure experiments, and while these experiments are generally at higher temperatures, experiments at \u223c2000 K were made over a wide range of pressure.\nWe evaluated whether there is a statistically discernable pressure or temperature effect on the H2O storage capacity in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite by regressing the ab initio calibrated H2O contents in the high pressure-temperature experiments with 15.2 wt% H2O to a general linear equation and a second order polynomial as a function of pressure and temperature. We fit all the data together and by fitting the data for stishovite independently of data for \u03b2-stishovite, while inspecting the importance of variables using stepwise regression (see Supplementary Table 3). We find that fitting all the data simultaneously to a regression that is linear in pressure and temperature provides the best overall fit statistics (adjusted R\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.83\n; see Supplementary Fig. 3) resulting in the equation:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n2\n\n\nO\n\n\n\u00a0(wt%)\n=\n\u2212\n0.0191\n\u00d7\nP\n\u00a0(GPa)\n\u2212\n0.00057\n\u00d7\nT\n\u00a0(K)\n\n\n+\n4.6527\n\n(\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.83\n)\n\n\n The regression predicts a dominant pressure dependence and a weak temperature dependence, and we use this expression to estimate the water content in subducted lithosphere in our discussion of water transport into the deep mantle.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nWater transport to the deep mantle in silica phases\nA silica phase is expected to be absent from the mineral assemblage in Earth's average mantle because the Mg\/Si ratio of primitive upper mantle peridotite is greater than unity (\u223c1.1) (McDonough and Sun, 1995). In contrast, oceanic crustal rocks (e.g., basalt, gabbro, terrigenous pelagic sediment) have Mg\/Si less than unity (Gale et al., 2013) and, therefore, silica phases can stabilize at high pressure in the crustal portion of subducted lithosphere (hereafter subducted crust refers to metabasalt + metasediment). Unique among hydrated crustal minerals, silica phases are stable at mantle pressures and temperatures all the way to the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and so represent potentially important hosts for carrying and storing H2O to the deep interior. Here we assess the capacity and possible mechanisms for silica phases to transport water into the deep mantle in the crust of subducted lithosphere.\nH2O is added to oceanic crust and sediment through hydration near the slab surface and hydrothermal alteration of basalt at mid-ocean ridges (Alt et al., 2013; Alt and Teagle, 2003). Plate-bending at the outer rise results in fracture development in the deforming plate, with fractures penetrating through the crust and extending some 20\u201330 km into the slab mantle allowing seawater to circulate deeply to hydrate deeper crust and mantle lithosphere (Faccenda, 2014; Wada et al., 2012). Estimates for H2O bound in hydrous phases and subducted into the mantle based on modern day subduction rates are of the order 0.7 to \n1.8\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n12\n\n\n kg\/yr (Hacker, 2008; Rupke et al., 2004; Schmidt and Poli, 2003; van Keken et al., 2011).\nHow much subducted H2O is released into the shallow upper mantle wedge beneath island arc volcanos depends on the phase equilibria of the hydrated rock composition (e.g., metabasalt, metaperidotite, metasediment) and the thermal structure of the subducting slab. Models of slab dehydration in modern subduction zones that consider these factors indicate that dehydration of hydrous phases in oceanic crust and mantle is relatively efficient beneath the volcanic front with, on average, more than half of the bound water released from slabs into the mantle at depths <150 km (Hacker, 2008; Rupke et al., 2004; Schmidt and Poli, 2003; van Keken et al., 2011). For example, in the study by van Keken et al. (2011), about two-thirds of the subducted H2O is removed from subducted slabs by a depth of \u223c230 km, with an estimated 2.2 to \n3.4\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n kg\/yr subducted beyond this depth split in an \u223c2:1 ratio between the crust and mantle portions of the slab. We use these estimates to assess the role of SiO2 phases in transporting H2O in subducting lithosphere as it transits beyond 230 km and through the transition zone and into the lower mantle, recognizing that absolute H2O fluxes are model dependent and based on modern subduction rates.\nIn the crustal portion of the slab phase relations for hydrous MORB and sediment show that phengite and lawsonite are the primary hosts for H2O at depths beyond 150 km in cooler slabs, but dehydration of these phases is complete by about 300 km (Okamoto and Maruyama, 2004; Poli and Schmidt, 2002). This deeper dehydration would remove most of the remaining H2O from oceanic crust to be released in the upper mantle, estimated at \n\u223c\n2\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n kg\/yr. In the sediment portion of the crust topaz-OH and phase egg constitute a minor portion of the mineral assemblage beyond 300 km and may host \u223c0.5 wt% H2O (Ono, 1998). In the basaltic portion of the crust no hydrous phases were detected beyond lawsonite breakdown by Okamoto and Maruyama (2004) or Ono (1998). However, recent work indicates that an Fe-Ti oxyhydroxide solid solution may crystallize under water-saturated conditions in metabasalt at transition zone conditions (Liu et al., 2018; Nishihara and Matsukage, 2016). However, we note that at 13 GPa this phase was absent in hydrous metabasalt in the experiments of Liu et al. (2018) but was present at 24 GPa. Oceanic crust has only a relatively minor capacity to transport H2O beyond 300 km in nominally anhydrous phases like garnet and clinopyroxene (e.g., <0.1 wt% or \n\u223c\n5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n kg\/yr).\nHydrous stishovite in subducted oceanic crust provides a mechanism for retaining significant H2O at 300 km and throughout the deep upper mantle and transition zone and into the lower mantle. A free silica phase begins to crystallize in basaltic oceanic crust as coesite at \u223c150 km, transforming to stishovite at \u223c250 km. Experiments indicate that in a mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) composition stishovite constitutes \u223c10 wt% of the mineral assemblage by 9 GPa (\u223c270 km), increasing to as much as 20 wt% or more in the transition zone and lower mantle (Okamoto and Maruyama, 1999; Ono, 1998; Ono et al., 2001; Perrillat et al., 2006). In siliceous oceanic sediments a silica phase constitutes \u223c30% of the mineral assemblage throughout the upper mantle and into the lower mantle (Irifune et al., 1994; Ono, 1998).\nIn the mantle portion of cooler slabs, H2O can be transported to depths beyond 300 km in post-serpentine phases (Phase A, Phase E and Phase D; \u223c1\u00d71011 kg\/yr) in modern subduction zones (Iwamori, 2004; Komabayashi and Omori, 2006; Rupke et al., 2004; Shirey et al., 2021; van Keken et al., 2011). However, subsequent dehydration of hydrated mantle occurs either in the transition zone as slabs stagnate (Bina, 1997), or in the shallow lower mantle when hydrous phases like ringwoodite, Al-poor Phase D and superhydrous Phase B dehydrate (Ohtani, 2015). Thus, deep dehydration of subducting mantle lithosphere in the shallow lower mantle potentially releases most of its H2O cargo, with the residual H2O content dependent on the storage capacity of nominally anhydrous phases (e.g., \u223c1000 ppm H2O or less).\n\nFig. 5\n shows the predicted H2O storage capacity in stishovite and \u03b2-stishovite and in bulk subducted oceanic crust along mantle and average modern slab crust geotherms (Katsura et al., 2010; Shirey et al., 2021; Walter, 2021). At 10 GPa, we estimate that stishovite has an H2O storage capacity of \u223c3.7 wt%, progressively reducing to \u223c0.7 wt% in \u03b2-stishovite at the base of the lower mantle (130 GPa) (Fig. 5a). Based on current rates of crustal production and subduction, we estimate the maximum mass of H2O that can enter the lower mantle stored in stishovite to be of the order \n3.5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n kg\/yr (Fig. 5b), which is sufficient to host all of the crustal H2O that would otherwise be released by 300 km because of lawsonite or phengite dehydration. Stabilization of an Fe-Ti oxyhydroxide in the transition zone may also enhance the storage capacity even further, even though its modal abundance will be only a few percent at most (Liu et al., 2017).\nStishovite alone can also accommodate all of the H2O released from the mantle portion of the slab at the base of the transition zone and shallow lower mantle if H2O-rich fluids or hydrous silicate melts migrate into the adjacent oceanic crust, possibly along pre-existing fracture systems related to lithospheric hydration. Once oceanic crust enters the lower mantle, aluminous phase D (\u223c25 GPa) (Pamato et al., 2015) and aluminous phase H (>\u223c45 GPa) (Nishi et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2015) stabilize and have much higher H2O storage capacities, \u223c15 wt% each, endowing the crust with a very large H2O storage capacity throughout the lower mantle (Ohtani, 2015). We note, however, that these hydrous phases will not stabilize until SiO2 phases are saturated with H2O as dictated by chemography (e.g., Walter et al., 2015).\nBecause aluminous phase H is stable throughout the lower mantle depth range, deeply subducted oceanic crust may retain all its H2O to the core mantle boundary (Ohira et al., 2014; Ohtani, 2015; Walter et al., 2015). However, if the slab crust thermally equilibrates with the convecting mantle as it transits the lower mantle, phase H may breakdown to form a hydrous melt (Walter et al., 2015), whereas \u03b2-stishovite will remain stable even at the high temperatures of the geotherm and retain some of the H2O, with some released into the lower mantle. Release of hydrous fluids or melt into the surrounding mantle will result in hydration through reaction with iron metal (Zhu et al., 2019) and silicate phases like bridgmanite and Ca-perovskite if these phases are undersaturated, which might be expected if the lower mantle after accretion crystallized relatively dry as a consequence of its high solidus and liquidus temperature (Dong et al., 2021). If the lower mantle phases are already saturated then H2O would remain in a partial melt because no other hydrous phases are stable at temperatures along the mantle geotherm (Walter et al., 2015).\nThe high H2O storage capacity of stishovite in oceanic crust provides a conduit for water transport from the upper mantle to the core mantle boundary. Over 4 Ga of subduction, about \n1.4\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n21\n\n\n kg of H2O can be added to the lower mantle transported in stishovite alone at current crustal production rates, or about one ocean mass. One ocean mass is similar to the total amount of H2O predicted to be added to the deep mantle over \u223c4 Ga of subduction based on modern H2O fluxes calculated from phase equilibria and thermal models (Hacker, 2008; Rupke et al., 2004; van Keken et al., 2011) and is remarkably close to the total mantle H2O content predicted on the basis of H2O\/CeO in mantle derived magmas (Hirschmann, 2018). Subduction of H2O to the CMB primarily hosted by \u03b2-stishovite may also potentially explain the higher average H2O content in the source of ocean island basalts if they originate from plumes sourced in the deep lower mantle (Hirschmann, 2006).\nOnce the subducted slab reaches the core mantle boundary, if the temperature of the crust remains below phase H dehydration, then effectively all the H2O deposited in the crust in the upper mantle can survive to the core mantle boundary (up to \n3.5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n kg\/yr). If phase H is no longer stable, then oceanic crust can transport \u223c0.2 wt% H2O (\n\u223c\n1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n11\n\n\n kg\/yr) primarily in \u03b2-stishovite (Fig. 3b). The high temperature of the outer core (\u223c4000 K) creates a super-adiabatic temperature gradient above the core (Hirose et al., 2013), which will induce phase H and possibly \u03b2-stishovite to dehydrate as crust stagnates at the CMB. Reaction of released water with the iron-metal of the core may add hydrogen to the outer core if it is undersaturated or crystallize new high-pressure phases such as FeO2H\nx\n and FeH5 (Hu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2017; Nishi et al., 2017; Pepin et al., 2017; Mao and Mao, 2020; Hu and Mao, 2021). Production of hydrous partial melt and iron hydride phases have both been shown to provide plausible explanations for the observed seismic anisotropy (Kendall and Silver, 1996) and anomalously slow P-wave velocities (Williams and Garnero, 1996) at the base of Earth's mantle. Thus, these features may be a hallmark of H2O subducted from the surface to the core-mantle boundary, with hydrous SiO2 phases the key hosts for transporting H2O from the upper mantle into the lower mantle.\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nYanhao Lin: Conceptualization, Methodology, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

The Reykjanes Peninsula in SW Iceland is a structural continuation of the oblique spreading Reykjanes Ridge, which goes onshore at the SW tip of the peninsula and extends from there as a 60 km long N72\u00b0E striking oblique rift, until it joins the Western Volcanic Zone and the South Iceland Seismic Zone at the Hengill triple junction in the east (Argus et al., 2011; Sigmundsson et al., 2020). The Reykjanes Peninsula oblique rift is expressed by a 5\u201310 km wide seismic and volcanic zone along the peninsula and is highly oblique with the spreading direction of N120\u00b0E in this region (Keiding et al., 2009) compared to the global plate motion in Iceland spreading at a rate of 18\u201319 mm\/yr in the direction of N105\u00b0E (Sigmundsson et al., 2020). Such a setting produces transtensional tectonics, characterized by high seismicity, volcanism, and high-temperature geothermal fields (Einarsson, 2008; Einarsson et al., 2018). The transtensional character of the oblique rift is expressed by the presence of both extensional structures where the extension is accommodated through normal faults and grabens and transform structures where the transform movements are accommodated along strike-slip faults.\nThe main tectonic features on the Reykjanes Peninsula are NE-SW trending hyaloclastite ridges, postglacial eruptive fissures and normal faults, with N-S striking strike-slip faults cross-cutting the normal faults (Fig. 1\n) (Clifton and Kattenhorn, 2006; Thordarson and Larsen, 2007). The fissures and normal faults of the Reykjanes Peninsula have a NE-SW trend, oblique to the plate boundary. They are grouped into fissure swarms, or volcanic systems, arranged en echelon along the plate boundary with the central area marked by maximum volcanic production. High-temperature geothermal systems have formed at the intersection of the seismic zone and all volcanic systems, except at Fagradalsfjall (S\u00e6mundsson et al., 2020).\nThe seismic activity on the Reykjanes Peninsula is high and occurs episodically, with large earthquake swarms occurring every 20 to 40 years (Bj\u00f6rnsson et al., 2020). The largest earthquakes occur on N-S trending strike-slip faults with magnitudes up to ML 6 (Einarsson, 1991; Keiding et al., 2009). In the central part of the peninsula, seismicity is mainly localized within the two fissure swarms of Fagradalsfjall and Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk, where energy is typically released in the form of earthquake swarms that form pronounced and spatially dense clusters, and where background seismicity is otherwise low (Keiding et al., 2009). The latest swarms in the Fagradalsfjall area occurred in July 2017 (M\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n3.7\n), December 2019 (M\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n3.7\n), July 2020 (M\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n5\n), and February-March 2021 (M\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n5.3\n). The individual swarms are fast, they usually last only few days and then gradually terminate, with events mostly confined to the upper crustal depths between 2 km and 6 km, occasionally down to 13 km depth (Keiding et al., 2009).\nPeriods of rifting and volcanism alternating with periods of earthquake episodes occur at intervals of \u223c800\u20131000 years on the Reykjanes Peninsula (S\u00e6mundsson et al., 2020). The volcanic activity seems to affect one volcanic system at a time, jumping successively from east to west, with the jumps spaced 100\u2013200 years apart. The volcanism is represented by basaltic lava fields in-between hyaloclastite ridges, lava shields and eruptive fissures and crater rows, forming together the Reykjanes Volcanic Belt (Thordarson and H\u00f6skuldsson, 2008). The Fagradalsfjall volcanic system in its central part is located between the Svartsengi and Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk systems. The latest eruptions date to the early Holocene, some 7000 years ago, characterized by short eruptive fissures and lava shields (S\u00e6mundsson and Sigurgeirsson, 2013).\nStrong seismic activity started in the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system with a ML 5.3 earthquake on 24 February 2021. Based on deformation data, it was interpreted as an intrusion of magma at shallow depths. The dyke propagation became clear on 1 March 2021, when the dyke-like inflation was first observed in InSAR data. Surface displacements were first detected by local GNSS stations, and then InSAR data from Sentinel-1 confirmed the dyke intrusion and slip along the oblique plate boundary (Sigmundsson et al., 2021)). The dyke eventually breached the surface on 19 March 2021, which led to the effusive fissure eruption in the Geldingadalir valley, a topographic low in the Fagradalsfjall complex, with a steady outflow of primitive basaltic lava and release of volcanic gases, lasting six months (Jardvis, 2021).\nThe preparatory phase related to the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption was, however, much longer. It was preceded by episodic earthquake swarm activity lasting several years. In 2017 and 2019, two less intense seismic swarms (M\n\n\n<\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n3.7\n) occurred, followed by more intense swarm seismicity (M\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n5\n) in 2020 and 2021; all located within the Fagradalsfjall volcanic system. Hrubcov\u00e1 et al. (2021) analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of the 2017 swarm and revealed an aseismic area in the central part of the seismogenic zone, which was interpreted as an emerging vertical magmatic dyke. Interestingly, this location coincides with the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption site.\nIn this paper, we focus on the seismic swarm of February-March 2021 that directly preceded the Fagradalsfjall eruption on 19 March 2021 and was related to magma movements. We use data from local seismic stations of the Reykjanet network, deployed in 2013 (Hor\u00e1lek, 2013). We present precise relative earthquake locations, and spatiotemporal evolution of the seismicity in relation to a dyke propagation that resulted in the eruption. We propose a seismotectonic model in the context of the stress field driving the magma outflow. We compare the 2021 seismic swarm with previous swarms in Fagradalsfjall in 2017, 2019, and 2020 and show the relevancy of these activities to the 2021 eruption. Our analysis helps shed light on the magma emplacement and faulting caused by the stress redistribution prior to the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption.\n\n\n2\nData processing and analysis\nThe local Reykjanet seismic network was deployed in 2013 (Hor\u00e1lek, 2013) (Fig. 1) and consists of 15 (Guralp CMG-3ESPC) broadband stations with a sampling rate of 250 sps and a GPS timestamp. These stations are deployed along the Reykjanes Peninsula, between the Svartsengi and Hengill geothermal fields, covering an area of 60x20 km. Since early 2021, data from all stations are streamed in real time.\nFor our analysis, the continuous seismic data were processed using the PEPIN package, based on the wave polarization detector and a STA\/LTA picker (Fischer, 2003). The measured P- and S-wave arrival times were associated to form seismic events, using the criteria of the maximum allowed time difference between the P-phases at stations, and the maximum event depth that constrains the maximum S-P time. Finally, preliminary location and magnitude estimation of the resulting events were determined with the requirement of a minimum of 3 P- and 1 S-phases. The procedure was applied to the one-month data, from 23 February to 21 March 2021, that contained the intense seismic swarm preceding the Fagradalsfjall eruption on 19 March 2021.\nIn total, 38,500 events were successfully located using the automatic procedure for the 2021 swarm. For further processing, only events fulfilling two criteria: (1) the mean arrival time residuals less than 0.15 s and (2) phase arrivals on at least 8 stations, were chosen. This selection was applied to omit outliers suffering from mixed phase associations, which occurred due to the fast pace of the swarm seismicity with overlapping waveforms of succeeding events. The automatically derived seismic catalog was supplemented with 398 manually picked events, the largest events available at the time of processing, following the approach of Bachura et al. (2019). The combined catalog of 9,000 events was relocated using the NonLinLoc algorithm (Lomax et al., 2009), and using the 1D velocity model (the SIL model) of Bjarnason et al. (1993) (Electronic supplement S1).\nEarthquake magnitudes were calculated using a formula for the Reykjanes Peninsula (Jakoubkov\u00e1, 2018), giving a ML of 5.3 for the largest earthquake of 24 February 2021. The magnitudes for this event from the SIL regional seismic network of the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) were ML 5.1 and MLW 5.7 (MLW represents a local version of MW for Iceland; Panzera et al., 2015). Hereinafter, we will use ML 5.3 for the largest earthquake, which was obtained from the Reykjanet data and lies within the range of the two IMO estimates.\nWaveform cross-correlation of nearby events with the mutual distance of hypocenters of less than 1 km was applied to measure the differential times which were used to improve the location precision based on automatic arrival time measurements. Waveforms were filtered in the 3\u201320 Hz frequency band using 0.2 s window of the vertical component for P- and 0.4 s window of the horizontal components for S-waves. A minimum cross-correlation factor of 0.8 was required for the differential time measurement (Electronic supplement S2). We did not cross-correlate the events with manual readings due to the high quality of the manual arrival time measurements, and to avoid the bias caused by the larger first pulse duration of the largest events (Bachura and Fischer, 2019). Finally, the combined catalog was relocated using the double-difference relocation method implemented in the HypoDD package (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000), using a thin-layer version of the SIL velocity model (26 layers) of Bjarnason et al. (1993) with constant velocity increase at each layer interface (Fig. 2\n). The final catalog consists of 8,631 relatively located events in the magnitude range of ML 0\u20135.3 (Fig. 2). During relocation, the sum of residuals of cross-correlation differential times decreased by 85% to 10 ms. As the absolute position of the double-difference relocations shifts according to the geometry of the seismic network, the relocations were corrected by \u2212403 m in the E-W and \u221252 m in the N-S direction, so that the centroids of the NonLinLoc and HypoDD locations were identical.\nIn addition to the 2021 earthquake swarm, the recent swarms of July 2017, December 2019, and July, August, and October 2020, also recorded at the local Reykjanet stations, were processed similarly, except for waveform cross-correlation. The automatic arrival time picks of all earthquake swarms were supplemented by the manually read arrival times of the strongest events and relocated using the NonLinLoc and HypoDD algorithms; the sum of residuals decreased by 65% to 25 ms.\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe final relocations of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall earthquake swarm (Fig. 2) show that the activity started with a ML 5.3 earthquake on 24 February at 10:05 UTC and the following seismicity migrated along two intersecting vertical clusters for almost four weeks at the depths of 2\u20136 km below the surface. The NE-SW trending cluster mapped the propagating dyke and the WSW-ENE cluster aligned with the plate boundary axis. The seismicity almost faded out right before the dyke breached the surface on 19 March 2021 at 20:45 UTC followed by an eruption along a NE-SW trending fissure, which lasted until September 2021.\nThe entire activity of the 2021 swarm splits between the Fagradalsfjall and Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk volcanic systems, separated by an aseismic belt of about 5 km width (Figs. 2, 4). In this paper we focus on the activity within the Fagradalsfjall system.\n\n3.1\nGeometry of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall earthquake swarm\nThe main cluster of the 2021 swarm trends NE-SW in a narrow 9 km long belt with high earthquake density (Fig. 2). This cluster is intersected centrally by a WSW-ENE trending cluster with a lower earthquake density. It splits the main NE-SW cluster into two segments, which were active during different periods (Fig. 2 inset): the northern segment #1 where the seismic activity started, (blue), and the southern segment #3 (red), which was activated later, after 3 March 2021. The WSW-trending cluster denoted as segment #2 (green) was activated repeatedly by multiple seismic bursts, namely at the beginning and during the middle period of the swarm (3\u201310 March). The place where the dyke breached the surface on 19 March (red circles and star in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively) is at the intersection of the main NE-SW cluster and the WSW-ENE cluster.\nThe two clusters are pronounced in different compactness of hypocenters. While the two NE-SW trending segments #1 and #3 show high event density with well-defined cluster boundaries, the WSW-ENE trending cluster, denoted as segment #2 in its western wing, displays a rather diffuse character. This segment #2 clearly follows the trend of the rift zone (see Fig. 1) and is optimally oriented to the principal stress directions. Keiding et al. (2009) gives the least compressive horizontal stress direction, Shmin, of 120\u00b0\u00b16\u00b0, based on inversions for stress of local earthquakes in Reykjanes which agrees well with the directions of the greatest extensional strain rate derived from GPS measurements (Keiding et al., 2008). On the other hand, the NE-SW segments #1 and #3, trending 45\u00b0 and 34\u00b0, respectively, are almost perpendicular to the minimum stress direction, which indicates the tensile character of the activated zone and its role in driving the magma flow. Accordingly, we refer to the NE-SW trending segments #1 and #3 as dyke segments. The oblique-rift events (segment #2) form four wings at an oblique angle to the dyke segments (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2). The most pronounced wings point to the WSW, however, note that its two minor wings point to the ENE. Interestingly, a clear anticlockwise offset of both wings is observed, with the eastern wings shifted by about 1 km north compared to the western wings. The existence of this offset is evidenced by tests (see Electronic supplement S3).\nWhile the WSW-ENE trending cluster (segment #2) accompanies the plate boundary axis, the origin of the dyke segments #1 and #3 with high earthquake density is clearly different. To reveal their true strike, which could appear different in map view due to the 3D character of the cluster, we fit a plane to each of them obtaining a strike of 45\u00b0and dip of 88\u00b0 for segment #1 and a strike of 34\u00b0 and dip of 89\u00b0 for segment #3 (Fig. 2). As vertical tensile fractures are formed along the maximum stress direction, the expected strike of tensile fractures is 30\u00b0, which fits very well with the strike of 34\u00b0 for the southern segment #3. The northern segment #1 deviates 15\u00b0 from the expected tensile fracture azimuth, which can be attributed to the local stress rotation in the vicinity of the oblique rift zone and stress perturbation due to the dyke intrusion. The alignment of the dyke segments with the maximum principal stress confirms that these are tensile fractures associated with the dyke intrusion.\nA closer look at the main NE-SW cluster reveals several void areas with lower density of hypocenters (Fig. 2). To explore the varying event density along the dyke segments of the swarm, we project the hypocenters onto a vertical section along the A-B profile from Fig. 2, excluding the rift seismicity, and display the density of hypocenters per 100 m2 (Fig. 3\na). An irregular coverage of the hypocenters is observed, which indicates a heterogeneous response of the rock medium to the stress perturbations invoked by the magma movement. The dyke segments are clearly separated by a void, aseismic U-shaped area, and a higher event density is observed in segment #3 than in segment #1. Interestingly, the eruption breached the surface just above the southern boundary of this U-shaped area, which coincides with the anticlockwise offset of the oblique rift zone (green epicenters in Fig. 2, highlighted by black arrows in Fig. 2 inset).\n\n\n3.2\nThe migration of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall swarm\nThe migration of the 2021 swarm activity (see also the animation in Electronic supplement S4) is schematically displayed in Fig. 3b where the rate of events is plotted for the three swarm segments. In Fig. 5 we divide the entire activity into six stages displayed in the map and cross section views, clockwise rotated to the azimuth of 35\u00b0 representing an interlay of both NE-SW dyke segments #1 and #3. The activity started with a short earthquake sequence on 24 February, initiated by a ML 5.3 earthquake, which was preceded by a few weak foreshocks (Figs. 4 and 5\n\na). Its magnitude exceeded the other strongest events by 0.6 and was followed by a short aftershock series with a typical decay of magnitudes, which qualifies itself as a typical mainshock-aftershock sequence (B\u00e5th, 1965; Hor\u00e1lek et al., 2015). The aftershock sequence occurred both within the Fagradalsfjall and the Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk volcanic systems with the hypocenter range between 1 and 6 km depth and activated the WSW-ENE trending cluster associated with the rift zone (segment #2). On 24 February at 17:16 UTC, a few earthquakes occurred 3 km north of the ML 5.3 mainshock (red dots in Fig. 4) and activated first the northern tip of NE-SW cluster (Fig. 5b) and then, until 2 March, the whole segment #1 associated with the dyke intrusion (Fig. 5c). Between 2 and 9 March, the swarm activated the central part of the NE-SW cluster and several bursts also re-activated the rift zone to the WSW (segment #2), as well as one small southerly oriented counterpart (Fig. 5d). Between 9 and 14 March, the swarm migrated to the south and activated the southern NE-SW segment #3 (Fig. 5e). Then, the seismic activity jumped back to the central part (red events in Fig. 5f) where it remained until the eruption on 19 March. Fig. 5f clearly shows that the eruption site is located at the intersection of the WSW-ENE cluster in the Fagradalsfjall zone and the main NE-SW-trending cluster associated with the dyke.\n\n\n3.3\nThe 2021 swarm in the context of previous swarms\nThe start of unrest in the Fagradalsfjall area can be traced back to at least July 2017, when an intense seismic swarm of ML 3.7 was followed by two subsequent swarms in 2019 (ML 3.7) and 2020 (ML 5). The foci of these swarms were jointly relocated with the 2021 swarm using HypoDD. These events are presented in Fig. 6\n, where events with M\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n1.5\n are shown for the 2017, 2019, and 2020 swarms, resulting in 317, 367, and 826 events, respectively; while the 2021 swarm is only plotted for events of M\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n2.5\n resulting in 1729 events, for clarity. The double-difference relocations show that each swarm formed a spatially dense cluster at depths mostly between 1 and 6 km, each activating slightly different segments of the oblique plate boundary.\nThe 2017 events (Fig. 6, green color) formed a 9-km-long cluster striking WSW-ENE (\u223c71\u00b0), where the activity migrated from ENE to WSW along two near-vertical fault segments (dip of \u223c85\u00b0 in the east; dip of \u223c70\u00b0 in the west). Hrubcov\u00e1 et al. (2021) identified an aseismic area in the central part of this cluster, interpreted as the presence of a ductile deeper-seated magmatic intrusion. Interestingly, the location of the small sub-cluster of events south of the main 2017 fault zone coincides with the subsequent activity in 2019. The 2019 swarm was located \u223c2 km to the south of the 2017 swarm, along a parallel fault also striking WSW-ENE (Fig. 6, blue). The 2020 seismicity (Fig. 6, yellow) coincides with the fault activated during 2017, as well as with the location of the WSW-ENE activity in 2021. The 2021 swarm (Fig. 6, red) activated a new NE-SW trending dyke and the WSW-ENE trending fault zone.\nComparison of the 2021 seismicity with the previous swarms of 2017, 2019 and 2020 (Fig. 6) shows that the WSW-ENE trending segment #2 of the 2021 swarm is identical with the northern branch of the rift zone activated by the 2017 and 2020 swarms, while the 2019 swarm activated a parallel structure, with an offset of about 2 km to the south. This highlights the unique character of the 2021 swarm, whose major part occurred along the main NE-SW trending cluster, which did not exist in the previous 2017\u20132020 activity. The coincidence of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption with (i) the intersection of the individual pre-activated fault segments, (ii) the emerging magmatic dyke location suggested by Hrubcov\u00e1 et al. (2021), and (iii) the identified U-shaped aseismic zone of the 2021 swarm (Fig. 3), suggests a crustal weakening under tension at this location.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nTectonic context\nThe focal mechanisms of selected events from the GCMT catalog of M\n\n\n>\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n4.3\n (Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2012) and those determined by the MTFIT (Pugh and White, 2018) show strike-slip character with N-S and E-W trending nodal planes (Fig. 7\na). Interestingly, the focal mechanisms along the dyke are the same as those occurring within the oblique rift zone. This indicates that the dyke movement has activated preexisting faults, optimally oriented in the present stress field.\nThe N-S trending faults are observed on the entire Reykjanes Peninsula, but they are more prominent in the east, in the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) (Sigmundsson et al., 1995; \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2003; Gudmundsson, 2007; Einarsson et al., 2018). Within the SISZ, the rift zone is trending in the E-W direction, interpreted by bookshelf faulting where left-lateral slip along the zone is transformed into right-lateral faulting along N-S trending fault planes (Einarsson, 1991; Sigmundsson et al., 1995). The surface ruptures (Vegager\u00f0in, 2021) of the 24 February 2021 mainshock show that the N-S fault plane was activated during the mainshock (Fig. 1), and the same most likely holds for many other earthquakes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The oblique trend of the rift zone on the peninsula does not allow direct application of the bookshelf concept of the SISZ to the Reykjanes Peninsula. The reason is that while the N-S faults are perpendicular to the E-W rift within the SISZ, they are oblique to the rift in Reykjanes. Furthermore, as noted by Gudmundsson (2007), the simple bookshelf model fails to explain the conjugate faults, which are common in the SISZ and are also documented on the Reykjanes Peninsula (e.g., Khodayar et al., 2018).\nTo understand how the N-S fault planes are consistent with the Fagradalsfjall seismic activity, we apply the Riedel shear concept (Fossen, 2016; Khodayar et al., 2018), which allows incorporating the NE-SW tensile fracture activated by the dyke. The Riedel shear model, oriented according to the observed dyke seismicity, is shown in Fig. 7b. The maximum stress component, \u03c3\nmax, is represented by the tensile fracture direction T. The shear on the left-lateral transform fault Y is decomposed into synthetic R and antithetic R' shear fractures and synthetic P shears, which are perpendicular to the R' shears (Fig. 7b). The R' and P shears are the conjugate fault system, optimally oriented to the maximum stress direction. By comparison of the Riedel concept with the geometry of activated clusters and focal mechanisms in Fig. 7a, it is found that the NE-SW dyke matches the tensile T fractures, the N-S striking nodal planes are the antithetic R' right-lateral shears and the E-W striking nodal planes are consistent with either P or R synthetic left-lateral shears. Hence, the Riedel shear model does not favor any of the two nodal planes as a fault plane; it shows that both are consistent with the stress field and the fault zone architecture. However, the surface rupture outcrop strongly favors the N-S trending fault plane. Note also that the WSW-ENE trending cluster is wide, compared to the NE trending cluster, which is consistent with their transform and dyke character, respectively.\nA closer look at Fig. 2 shows that segment #2 continues to the east along a wing which has a counterclockwise offset of about one kilometer. This, along with the left-lateral slip parallel to the oblique rift zone, generates the extension at this step-over. This results in the crust weakening in the area, similar to the pull-apart basin concept (Fossen, 2016) (Fig. 8\n). Interestingly, this extensional zone matches exactly the eruption fissure location and its NE-SW extension. This suggests that the Fagradalsfjall eruption was controlled by stress perturbations in the rift zone related to the ongoing left-lateral slip and seismic activity.\nThe relation between tectonic and magmatic processes is also visible from InSAR data (Sigmundsson et al., 2021). The InSAR data related to the February-March 2021 pre-eruption period indicated more than 30 cm relative deformation in the vertical direction trending similarly along the NE-SW axis. The largest deformation is visible NE from the location of the subsequent eruption (Sigmundsson et al., 2021), which coincides with the U-shaped aseismic zone along the northern dyke segment (Fig. 5). These two observations point to the probable magma accumulation in the aseismic U-shaped zone at the depth interval of 2\u20134 km.\n\n\n4.2\nCoulomb stress\nAccording to Fig. 4, the February-March 2021 earthquake swarm followed the 24 February 2021 ML 5.3 mainshock. To answer the question whether this earthquake could trigger the following intense activity, we computed the change of Coulomb Failure Stress \u0394CFS (e.g. Harris, 1998)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nCFS\n\n=\n\u0394\n\u03c4\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\u0394\n\u03c3\n\n\n due to a horizontal slip along the N-S trending vertical fault (Fig. 9\n). We used the Coulomb software (Toda et al., 2011), where \u0394\u03c4 and \u0394\u03c3 are the changes of the shear and normal stress, and \u03bc is the friction coefficient. In this context, the fault is brought closer to failure if the applied stress increment \u0394CFS exceeds the threshold shear stress. A simplified geometry of a 7 km long vertical rectangular fault was used, extending south from the mainshock hypocenter. The length of the rupture and its southwards extension is based on the observed surface ruptures on the road, 6 km south of the epicenter (Vegager\u00f0in, 2021) (Fig. 7). \u0394CFS was resolved at the depth of 3 km, in the center of a 6 km wide rupture, for the receiver faults of the same strike and dip as the source fault; a slip of 0.1 m and a friction coefficient of 0.6 are supposed. However, this settings does not influence the shape of the stress lobes.\nThe resulting stress image shows a decrease of Coulomb stress along a wide NNE-SSW trending belt including the fault plane, and two pairs of narrow lobes of increased \u0394CFS at the fault plane tips. For comparison, epicenters following the mainshock during the next 38 hours are shown in Fig. 9. The vast majority of these events occurred in the positive Coulomb stress areas, indicating that these are aftershocks of the ML 5.3 earthquake. These include both the events to the WSW illuminating the oblique rift zone segment, and the first events of the earthquake swarm in the NE dyke segment #1. Interestingly, no aftershocks are observed in the southern positive \u0394CFS lobes.\n\n\n4.3\nMagmatic dykes in extensional settings\nLateral migration of a magma-filled dyke, sometimes up to tens of kilometers, frequently precede volcanic eruptions (e.g., \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2016; Woods et al., 2019). Some of these dyke intrusions freeze at depth (e.g. White et al., 2011) while others breach the surface, resulting in a fissure eruption (e.g., Hamling et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2012; Sigmundsson et al., 2015). Pre-existing stresses and material properties of the rift fabric, in this case, strongly influence the extent of the accompanying seismicity (Rubin and Gillard, 1998; Rivalta et al., 2015). Many examples exist on seismicity accompanying a dyke propagation (Battaglia et al., 2005; Morita et al., 2006; Keir et al., 2009; \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2016). However, unlike in these examples, the magma feeding the propagating dyke preceding the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption originated not from a deflating crustal magma chamber, but was instead mantle-sourced (Sigmundsson et al., 2021). No known magma chambers nor acidic rocks are found on the Reykjanes Peninsula (S\u00e6mundsson et al., 2020). It is unclear if the episodic seismic activity on the Reykjanes Peninsula is of tectonic origin only, or if some of the earthquake swarms are of magmatic origin without any eruption (Bj\u00f6rnsson et al., 2020 and references therein).\nWe find that the earthquake swarm in the NE dyke segment #1 following the ML 5.3 mainshock on 24 February 2021 originates in the positive Coulomb stress change area (Fig. 9). Therefore, we infer that the earthquake swarm, later confirmed as a dyke propagation, was triggered by the ML 5.3 mainshock. Large earthquakes in Iceland have promoted failure in increased Coulomb stress areas, such as the aftershocks of the 2000 SISZ event (\u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2003).\nAnother interesting observation of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall dyke is the concentration of seismicity, which is mainly located at 2\u20136 km depth (Fig. 2). Very little seismicity is observed above 2 km depth, where ambient differential stresses were likely not high enough to produce earthquakes. \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir et al. (2016) made a similar observation for the 2014 B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga-Holuhraun dyke in NE Iceland. Similarly, Woods et al. (2019) applied Coulomb Stress modeling for the 2014 B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga-Holuhraun dyke and showed that the dyke seismicity was concentrated at the base of the dyke at 6 km depth, which is consistent with the depth of the brittle-ductile transition in the area. On the Reykjanes Peninsula, brittle-ductile transition lies at 4\u20136 km depth, up-doming beneath the high-temperature geothermal fields (Fl\u00f3venz et al., 2022). Therefore, it is consistent with the depth extent of the Fagradalsfjall dyke.\n\n\n4.4\nSpatial and temporal evolution of the pre-eruption swarm\nThe ML 5.3 mainshock triggered a short aftershock sequence trending in the WSW-ENE direction along the rift zone (Fig. 5a). This aftershock sequence was not only located in the Fagradalsfjall area, but also affected the Kr\u00fdsuv\u00edk fissure swarm to the east, triggering events with the same WSW-ENE trend. However, both segments are separated by an aseismic area of \u223c5 km width (Fig. 4). Such a gap in seismicity, alternating with focused seismicity, is quite commonly observed on the Reykjanes Peninsula. It represents different types of deformation common in the rift zones with the alternation of seismically and aseismically released tectonic stress as discussed e.g., by Klein et al. (1977) and Einarsson (1991).\nSubsequently, in the evening of 24 February 2021 (at 20:00 UTC), a swarm was initiated (Fig. 5b) north of the mainshock and extended until 2 March (Fig. 5c). It formed a narrow near-vertical band of events along the NE-SW oriented segment #1 (azimuth 45\u00b0) in the depth range of 3\u20136 km with sharp boundaries. The seismicity first propagated upwards in the SW direction with several reversals, trending similarly along the NE-SW axis. Migrating seismicity is usually attributed to two possible reasons: (a) magma propagation or (b) migration of magma-related fluids (Fl\u00f3venz et al., 2022). In Fagradalsfjall, the surface displacement favors direct magma movements and propagation of a magmatic dyke (Sigmundsson et al., 2021). This is also in agreement with other studies highlighting volcanic eruptions in the rift zones being often preceded by lateral migration of magma-filled dykes (e.g., Rubin, 1992; Belachew et al., 2011; Sigmundsson et al., 2015). From this point of view, the NE-SW migrating seismicity provides evidence on gradual dyke-front propagation due to magma movements and inflation\/deflation of the dyke.\nIn the next stage, between 2 and 9 March, the seismicity re-activated the central part of the dyke path forming a triple junction around the subsequent eruption site. The dyke propagated southwestwards, and several bursts re-activated the rift zone to the WSW (Fig. 5d). Moreover, the seismic activity framed the U-shaped aseismic zone in the central part of the NE-SW trending dyke at 2\u20134 km depth (Fig. 3). The coincidence of the aseismic U-shaped zone, the largest surface displacement, and the proximity to the eruption site points to the magma accumulation at this place.\nDuring the next stage, between 9 and 14 March, the swarm migrated further south, activating segment #3 (Fig. 2 and 5e). Meanwhile, almost no activity occurred in other segments. This southern dyke segment #3 was again nearly vertical, quite narrow, and well delimited. Compared to the northern dyke segment #1, its depth range of 2\u20135 km was slightly broader as well as its strike was 34\u00b0 (Fig. 3), unlike 45\u00b0 in segment #1. When it reached the southernmost tip of the dyke, it activated a short part of the southern WSW-trending branch of the rift zone. In the morning of 15 March, the activity jumped to the NE, moving back to the central part of the dyke path, and terminated near the future eruption site.\nFinally, after four days of weak seismic activity (Fig. 2, 5f), the magma breached the surface on 19 March, resulting in the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption in the central part of the NE-SW-trending dyke, right above the SW edge of the U-shaped aseismic zone (Fig. 5e). A 6-month-lasting effusive lava outflow followed. (The detailed swarm evolution is also shown in Electronic supplement S4.)\n\n\n4.5\nTectonic stress transfer, seismicity and lava outflow\nBased on the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall earthquake swarm and detailed analysis of the activity, we propose the following understanding of the pre-eruption processes.\nThe mainshock of 24 February 2021 triggered the short aftershock sequence to the WSW along the northern branch of the rift zone. This is indicated by the Coulomb stress modelling, which shows clear coincidence of the elevated CFS zone with the aftershock occurrence (Fig. 9). In the Fagradalsfjall area, the rift zone forms an anticlockwise step-over with an offset of about one kilometer, which coincides with the dyke trend and location (Fig. 8). Such a step-over, together with the left-lateral slip on the rift zone, generates an extension zone resulting in the crust weakening under tension. This feature is consistent with the pull-apart basin concept, confirmed also by modelling (e.g., Farangitakis et al., 2021), explaining the interactions between the strike-slip and extensional tectonics (Fossen, 2016). The pull-apart basin is limited to the distance between the faults and the step-over and is in a favorable position for the extensional or transtensional stress. Moreover, the transtensional setting generates greater surface deformation than the pure strike-slips, confirmed by modelling (Wu et al., 2009). The location of the Fagradalsfjall eruption site and the entire eruptive fissure of about 800 m length fits perfectly the fault step-over (Figs. 1, 8), which supports our hypothesis that the eruption was controlled by stress perturbations in the shallow crust. These issues were related to the ongoing left-lateral slip deviated by the anticlockwise step-over and the resulting zone of the extensional tectonics within the step-over. The Coulomb stress analysis also reveals that the mainshock could be responsible for initiating the following seismic swarm activity and the subsequent eruption by perturbing crustal stress and a present pocket of magma (Fig. 8).\nThe main NE-SW-propagating seismic activity relates to the magmatic dyke movements. This is supported by the systematic migration of seismicity, by the orientation of the activated segment along the maximum principal stress, and by the large magma-related deformation. The migration of seismicity maps the gradual dyke-front propagation: (i) first propagating back and forth in the northern part of the dyke path trending 45\u00b0, (ii) then activating the central part of the dyke, and (iii) finally moving to the south and activating the SW part of the dyke at an azimuth of 34\u00b0. The general trend of the dyke corresponds to the strike of the eruptive fissures on the Reykjanes Peninsula and is related to the extensional tectonics (Fig. 1). Slightly different angles of the northern (45\u00b0) and southern (34\u00b0) segments of the dyke can be related to different local settings and possible stress rotation in the vicinity of the oblique rift zone.\nThe rift zone trends WSW-ENE and is bounded from the north and the south by two parallel seismicity branches at a distance of \u223c2 km. Both these branches were activated during previous swarms of 2017, 2019 and 2020 (Fig. 6). This highlights the unique character of the 2021 swarm, whose major part occurred along the NE-SW structure, which did not exist during the previous 2017\u20132020 swarm activities. This NE-SW seismicity accompanied the dyke propagation and intersected the related segment of the rift zone at an oblique angle (Fig. 6). The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption occurred at the intersection of the individual activated segments. Interestingly, this was the place where Hrubcov\u00e1 et al. (2021), based on the analysis of the 2017 swarm, revealed an emerging magmatic dyke, and where the aseismic U-shaped zone of the 2021 swarm was identified (Figs. 3 and 6). From this point of view, the Fagradalsfjall pre-eruption activity can be seen as the result of transtensional faulting leading to the volcanic eruption at the pull-apart step-over point.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe analyzed the 2021 Fagradalsfjall pre-eruption seismicity to trace the processes leading to the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula, SW Iceland. We obtained over 30,000 automatically located earthquakes with magnitudes of ML 0\u20135.3 (24 February 2021 mainshock) using data from the local Reykjanet seismic network from 23 February to 20 March 2021.\nDouble-difference relocations indicate the activation of different fault segments of the transtensional rift zone on the Reykjanes Peninsula revealing interactions between tectonic and magmatic processes. We identified two main hypocenter clusters activating two fault systems: the main cluster of a NE-SW trend related to the magmatic dyke propagation and the extensional part of the rift zone, and the secondary WSW-ENE trending cluster activating the plate boundary axis. Both clusters intersected at the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption site. These results agree with relocated hypocenters of the preceding 2017, 2019 and 2020 swarms, showing two parallel WSW-ENE oriented branches (2 km apart) along the rift zone, coinciding with the subsidiary WSW-ENE trending cluster of the 2021 swarm. This points to the unique character of the 2021 swarm where the major activity occurred along the main NE-SW trending cluster, which did not exist in previous activities.\nThe main NE-SW propagating 2021 seismicity relates to the magmatic dyke movements. This is supported by the systematic migration of seismicity, by the orientation of the activated segment along the maximum principal stress, and by the large magma-related surface deformation. Though systematic, the 2021 dyke propagation was, however, complex: it started at the northern end migrating southwestwards, and when populating the southernmost dyke segment, jumping again to the central part of the dyke path where the effusive eruption eventually took place. Only one dyke segment was active at a time with continuous seismicity along the dyke, unlike the seismicity along the plate boundary axis that was characterized by several rapid earthquake bursts.\nThe ML 5.3 mainshock shows the N-S striking fault planes interpreted as the right-lateral antithetic Riedel shears that accommodate the left-lateral slip along the rift zone. This mainshock was immediately followed by a short aftershock sequence in the WSW-ENE rift zone and subsequently (eight hours later) by a small swarm in the northern dyke segment. Coulomb Failure Stress modelling shows that the mainshock could have triggered not only the aftershock sequence but also the earthquake swarm along the dyke. The almost 4 weeks long migrating nature of the NE-SW oriented dyke suggests that the earthquakes were caused by magma movements. The dyke breached the surface on 19 March 2021, right above the location of the aseismic area detected in the 2017 and 2021 swarms.\nThe location of the eruptive fissure precisely coincides with the anticlockwise step-over of the rift zone, forming a pull-apart basin structure in the area of eruption. This shows that the magma erupted at the place of crustal weakening under tension. The long-term left-lateral slip along the plate boundary caused the redistribution of the crustal stress at the future eruption site.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nT.

The majority of Mars' recent geological past has been largely driven by aeolian processes (Sagan and Bagnold, 1975; Diniega et al., 2021). Features, such as yardangs and stabilized dunefields provide a record of past climate (Banks et al., 2018; Urso et al., 2018). Active ripples and dunes provide a record of current surface winds (Runyon et al., 2017a; Silvestro et al., 2020; Bridges et al., 2017; Vaz et al., 2017). Dunefields also provide a record of geomorphic change from interactions with volatile cycles (Diniega et al., 2017; Chojnacki et al., 2021) and may record changes in wind regimes due to Mars' obliquity changes (Runyon et al., 2017b).\nA sediment budget is defined as the difference between the quantity (mass or volume) of sediment entering an area of interest, such as a dunefield, versus the quantity of sediment leaving the same area [Equation (1); where \u0394S is the change in sediment storage, I is the sediment inputs (influx), and E is the sediment outputs (efflux)].\n\n(1)\n\n\u0394\nS\n=\nI\n\u2212\nE\n\n\n\n\nSediment budgets are vital for determining the degree of, and controls on, erosion or deposition processes. On Earth, sediment budgets are fundamental for understanding geologic impacts to natural resources and infrastructure. Sediment budgets can be influenced in whole or in part by naturally occurring physical processes, such as volcanic eruptions, debris flows, and fluvial, glacial, or aeolian sediment transport. These controls on sediment budgets are applicable in geomorphologically-active regions of planetary bodies, such as Mars, Venus, Earth, Europa, and Titan.\nThere are two common methods geomorphologists use to determine a sediment budget: flux-based and morphological, which we term the in-situ and remote sensing methods, respectively, in this paper (Table 1\n). The former approach determines the budget by making mass-based measurements of the sediment flux variables I and E to solve for the \u0394S variable on the left side of Equation (1). The latter method determines the budget from remote sensing topographic change detection of volumetric changes in sediment storage. The remote sensing method directly measures the \u0394S variable but presents a problem, because it provides an estimate of the difference between I and E but does not quantify I or E individually unless they are known or assumed to be zero.\nGeomorphologists refer to a \u201cclosed sediment budget\u201d when I-E is shown to equal \u0394S after making the necessary conversions between sediment mass and volume in a field experiment for a river, aeolian dunefield, hillslope, or alluvial fan, for example. In practice, however, sediment budgets rarely do close, because of measurement errors and uncertainties, and differences in the temporal and spatial sampling resolution and integration. On Earth, an increasingly common approach to attempt to close a sediment budget is to make mass-based sediment flux measurements of I and E and compare them to remote sensing change detection of \u0394S (e.g., Erwin et al., 2012; Grams et al., 2013, 2018). Doing so can provide powerful insight into landscape evolution for academic and theoretical purposes, as well as practical engineering and resource management applications. Practically speaking, the comparison of in-situ and remote sensing sediment budgets on Earth, where both techniques are available to investigators, may provide insight into potential errors with the remote sensing technique, which is the only method currently available for sediment budget quantification on planetary bodies outside Earth.\nCurrently, only the remote sensing method is available to investigate sediment budgets on Mars. Remote sensing of bedform processes, in some cases from multi-temporal image time series, is used to estimate sand fluxes from measurements of dune migration rates and dune heights on Mars (Bridges et al., 2012; Chojnacki et al., 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019; Runyon et al., 2017a,b; Roback et al., 2020, 2022). Roback et al. (2020) estimated components of the morphological sediment budget for a dunefield on Mars with HiRISE images and digital terrain models by measuring dune migration rates and the volume of sand trapped in a crater located downwind of the dunefield relative to the expected volume of sand eroded from the dunefield. However, change detection of repeat topographic data is not yet commonly employed on Mars (Sutton et al., 2022), though can be performed with data returned from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE; McEwen et al., 2007) using photogrammetry methods (Beyer, 2015; Beyer et al., 2018). Fig. 1\n illustrates the remote sensing method to quantify sediment budgets for Martian dunes using change detection of HiRISE digital elevation models (DEMs) separated by 2.5 Mars years (4.7 Earth years) to produce digital elevation models of difference (DODs) to quantify the \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n sediment budget. See Table S1 in Supplementary Material 2 for details regarding the HiRISE data used for this investigation.\nIn contrast to Mars, investigators on Earth use both methods. The remote sensing method is limited in its accuracy because sediment fluxes are inferred but are not directly measured. Additionally, remote sensing sediment budgets can have large uncertainties owing to compensating sediment erosion and deposition on the lee and slipfaces of migrating dunes during the inter-survey period that while accurate for the time period examined may mask otherwise considerable sediment fluxes through the study area (e.g., the bypass fraction of sediment not deposited on slipfaces, sensu Mohrig and Smith, 1996). Uncertainties associated with the remote sensing method can be so large that the derived sediment budgets are often indeterminate \u2013 that is, they cannot reliably distinguish whether an area is undergoing erosion or deposition \u2013 without additional corroboration using in-situ measurements as shown by studies on Earth (e.g., Bangen et al., 2014a; Grams and Schmidt, 2005).\nDespite the fundamental importance of sediment budgets for planetary science, and the widespread use of the remote sensing and in-situ methods for quantifying sediment budgets across geologic domains on Earth, there has been surprisingly little research on how well the sediment budgets produced by these two techniques reconcile with one another. For ongoing and future geomorphic research on Mars, this means there is a general need to further our knowledge of sediment budgets and highlights the lack of quantitative understanding of uncertainties for sediment budgets measured with remote sensing. Here we use a concise background review to explore: 1) how in-situ and remote sensing sediment budgets are typically constructed for aeolian dunefields; and 2) how the combination of the two methods is used to evaluate sediment budget errors in the fluvial geomorphology discipline on Earth, where the approach is commonly put into practice for river science applications. We then evaluate the relative differences of in-situ and remote sensing sediment budgets for a terrestrial analog aeolian dunefield case study. Our overall goal is to frame a path forward for addressing shortcomings of remote sensing sediment budgets in extraterrestrial aeolian settings like Mars where in-situ methods are not currently tractable.\n\n\n2\nBackground review\nUsing in-situ measurements to reconcile remote sensing sediment budgets (or vice versa as shown in Fig. 2\n) is commonly employed in fluvial environments on Earth where there is a clear downriver direction of water flow and sediment transport, even though localized zones of turbulence and flow recirculation occur (Grams et al., 2018). In aeolian environments on Earth, these approaches have been primarily used in coastal dunefields that have a clear on- or along-shore wind directional regime and thus an upwind sediment supply from ocean sediment deposits such as sandy beaches.\nThe most conceptually straightforward method for quantifying a sediment budget is through in-situ, or direct, measurement of sediment fluxes. In terrestrial aeolian dunefields, these measurements are typically collected using a vertical array of sediment catchers placed at the upwind and downwind site boundaries. Aeolian sediment horizontal mass flux at a given above-ground height (HMFz) can be determined from a sediment catcher in units of mass per area per time using Equation (2):\n\n(2)\n\n\nHMFz\n\n=\nm\n\/\n(\n\n\nA\n\n\nc\n\n\nt\nf\n)\n\n\n where m is the sediment mass collected, \n\n\nA\n\n\nc\n\n\n is the cross-sectional area of the sediment catcher opening, t is the integration time, and f is the catcher efficiency, which can range from 0 to 1 (Goossens et al., 2000). Using a vertical array of individual sediment catchers, HMFz is typically integrated over the height above ground using an exponential function; Equation (3) is one example of this from Shao and Raupach (1992):\n\n(3)\n\n\nHMFz\n\n=\nc\n\n\ne\n\n\na\n\n\nz\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\nb\nz\n\n\n\n\n where z is the height from the ground to the center of the sediment catcher inlet and a, b, and c are fitting constants. The total horizontal mass flux (HMF; units of mass per length per time) is then determined by integrating HMFz from the ground to a nominal height (e.g., 1 m as shown below in Equation (4)):\n\n(4)\n\n\nHMF\n\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nHMFz\n\n\nd\nz\n\n\n\n\nOnce in-situ measurements are complete, the sediment budget for a given time period (\u0394S; units of volume) is computed as the difference between sediment influx (I) and efflux (E) over that time period (Equation (5)), which are represented by the HMF at the up- and downwind site boundaries, respectively. Sediment porosity (p) and density (y) are applied as scaling factors to the in-situ budget because I and E determine the mass-based sediment flux past a boundary, but do not account for packing once that sediment is deposited.\n\n(5)\n\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n\n\n=\n(\nI\n\u2212\nE\n)\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\np\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile conceptually simple, the in-situ technique suffers from two disadvantages. First, the approach requires significant financial and logistical resources, as equipment must be obtained, deployed, and maintained, often in remote sites. Sediment traps, for example, must be visited regularly to record data and to be emptied when filled with sediment. This is a hindrance in extraterrestrial research, where deploying and maintaining in-situ equipment can be impossible.\nSecondly, the accumulation of measurement error through time is non-trivial; any measurement of sediment flux may contain inherent error or bias, and those errors rapidly accumulate as the number of measurements increases. Several factors can generate in-situ measurement error, including non-uniform sediment flux across a site, errors in upscaling discrete measurements to whole-site areas and longer time frames, and sediment mass transport calculation uncertainties (Ellis et al., 2009; Webb et al., 2019; Zobeck et al., 2003). These errors can grow so large through time that simply determining whether a site is undergoing erosion or deposition may not be possible. As an example, Fig. 2 details the accumulation of error in measurements of fluvial sediment in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon from 2002 to 2010 (Grams et al., 2013; Topping and Wright, 2016). In the example, error accumulates through time for the primary in-situ method and the remote sensing method is used as a secondary check to reset the sediment budget errors to zero three times during the calendar year from 2004 to 2005 (Fig. 2). However, note that without the check from the remote sensing method after 2005, the uncertainty in the in-situ method eventually grows so large that from 2008 to 2010 the budget cannot be characterized as net erosional or depositional (Fig. 2).\nGiven the logistical difficulties and potentially large accumulating errors in quantifying sediment budgets using in-situ techniques, many researchers turn to remote sensing change detection to indirectly estimate the sediment budget of an area. This is an inverse technique (Ashmore and Church, 1998; Church, 2006; Vericat et al., 2017; Sankey et al., 2018a,b), whereby the volume of eroded or deposited sediment required to drive observed changes in surface topography is computed. To begin, at least two topographic surveys of an area of interest are required. These can be collected by a variety of methods, including photogrammetry, lidar, sonar, GPS, or total station surveys. To compute the sediment budget for the region encompassed by the topographic surveys, the inter-survey elevation change in each pixel (\n\n\nz\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nz\n\n\n1\n\n\n) is computed and multiplied by the pixel area (A), yielding a volume of sediment eroded or deposited on a per-pixel basis (Equation (6)). The summation of this difference for all pixels in the survey area yields the volumetric sediment budget:\n\n(6)\n\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n=\n\u2211\nA\n(\n\n\nz\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nz\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n While methodologically straightforward, the remote sensing approach also suffers from significant drawbacks related to: (i) potential underestimation of sediment fluxes and (ii) measurement uncertainty. With regard to the former, the technique infers, but does not directly measure, sediment fluxes. The volume changes that are computed on a per-pixel basis from sequential DEMs thus represent a minimum estimate of sediment flux during the inter-survey period, a phenomenon recognized in many environments (e.g., Erwin et al., 2012; Kasprak et al., 2019; Lindsay and Ashmore, 2002). This is because offsetting volumes of erosion and deposition may combine to produce relatively little elevation change (and thus a small remote sensing-based flux estimate), when in fact larger volumes of sediment were transiting through an area over the inter-survey period. Given the potential for compensating erosion and deposition to mask what are actually large sediment fluxes, it is advisable to reconcile any remote sensing sediment budget using in-situ data. For aeolian dunefields, this is done with in-situ measurements of I and E.\nIn addition to the potential underestimation of sediment fluxes due to compensating erosion and deposition, remote sensing estimates of sediment budgets are also prone to errors from measurement uncertainty. The constituent DEMs from which elevation changes, and volumetric sediment budgets, are derived each contain varying degrees of measurement uncertainty. This uncertainty results primarily from (i) instrument error (in the case of satellite sensor, lidar, GPS, total station, etc.; see Bangen et al., 2014, 2014a, 2016 & Wheaton et al., 2010), and (ii) interpolation error that results from generating a raster DEM from native point-based measurements of elevation (Kaplinski et al., 2017). The result of these DEM errors is that any elevation changes used to quantify a site-scale sediment budget must be evaluated to determine whether those changes are true and driven by geomorphic processes, or whether they are spurious changes arising from survey error, or \u2018noise\u2019. Error estimation techniques based on survey quality and terrain complexity have been recently developed (Bangen et al., 2016; Kasprak et al., 2015) and applied in dunefield studies (Kasprak et al., 2017; Sankey et al., 2018a,b) though not in extraterrestrial studies to our knowledge. These techniques can aid in thresholding, or removing, potentially erroneous elevation changes from sediment budget analyses based on the magnitude of change by removing very low-magnitude elevation changes within the instrument's measurement tolerance, or as a spatially variable function of surveyed surface complexity.\n\n\n3\nAnalog case study \u2013 investigating sediment budget errors using chasma floor dunefields\n\n3.1\nChasma floor dunefields on Earth and Mars: morphology and setting\nChasma floor dunefields on Earth and Mars provide a useful test case to evaluate aeolian dunefield sediment budget errors because they respond to boundary conditions of wind regime and sediment supply (Figs. 3 and 4\n\n). For example, the physiography of canyon environments often drives chasma-parallel wind directions that can be inferred from chasma orientation and dune morphology. The dunes vary in size and composition owing to upwind sediment source areas (Figs. 3 and 4). Here we present a case study for quantitative sediment budgeting using sites from Valles Marineris on Mars and the Grand Canyon on Earth. Currently, only the remote sensing method is available to estimate sediment budgets for dunefields on Mars. However, analogous chasma floor aeolian dunefields are common within Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA on Earth (Fig. 4; Sankey et al., 2018a,b) where both methods for estimating sediment budgets are feasible.\n\n3.1.1\nChasma floor dunefields in Valles Marineris, Mars\nDunes within the Valles Marineris rift system of Mars are associated with a variety of landforms that serve as potential sediment sources (Chojnacki et al., 2014a,b; Boazman et al., 2021). Prior work has indicated that Valles Marineris dunefields are likely derived from a variety of local and regional (intra-rift) sediment sources (Lucchitta et al., 1992; Chojnacki et al., 2010, 2014a, 2014b; Fenton et al., 2014; Boazman et al., 2021). Spectral and thermal mapping has revealed the principal sand dune sources for the region are Noachian-aged lower wall materials composed of primary (igneous) minerals and glasses. Other locations show evidence for sediment derivation from adjacent Early Hesperian-aged, hydrated sulfate-bearing sedimentary layered units (Chojnacki et al., 2014b). This finding indicates sediment stored in these sedimentary units act as secondary sources.\nAmong the different dunefield classes, floor dunefields display the most variability in Valles Marineris dune morphology, having sand sheet, star, echo, and linear dunes, including both compound and complex variations (Fig. 3) (Hayward et al., 2007). In the simplest case, barchanoid, barchan, and transverse dunes develop on central floors as they conform to a unidirectional wind regime (Fig. 3). More commonly, topographic elements, such as walls or landslides, disrupt simple dunes, instead forming echo and linear duneforms (Fig. 3). Converging or diverging multidirectional wind regimes can also develop as regional-scale katabatic wind patterns interact with and drain into the rift (Rafkin and Michaels, 2003; Toigo and Richardson, 2003; Fenton et al., 2014) developing falling dunes draped on wall slopes and star dunes on central floors (Fig. 3; Chojnacki et al., 2010, 2014a).\nSediment supply varies across Valles Marineris and is largely dependent on the wind regime complexity and sand source (Chojnacki et al., 2014b; Fenton et al., 2014). Supply-limited conditions predictably form barchans which migrate at relatively high rates (e.g., Ganges Chasma; (Fenton et al., 2014)). High sediment-supply dunefields develop in constructive wind regimes where larger magnitude bedform sizes and sand fluxes occur (e.g., Juventae Chasma; (Chojnacki et al., 2014a,b)).\n\n\n3.1.2\nChasma floor dunefields in Grand Canyon, Earth\nFifty-seven floor dunefields occur in Grand Canyon along the margins of the Colorado River, downwind of river sandbars, with aeolian sand overlying other topographic surfaces that are characteristic of deep-chasma landscapes such as debris fans, talus slopes, and terraces (Fig. 4; Sankey et al., 2018a). Change detection of high-resolution topographic surveys and analysis of weather station data have been previously employed at several Grand Canyon floor dunefields to characterize their wind directional regime and sediment supply characteristics (Sankey et al., 2018a,b). These dunefields are supplied with sand transferred by wind from contemporary river sandbars. The sandbars are themselves formed and maintained with sediment from the Colorado River (Schmidt, 1990). In the simplest case, floor dunefields in Grand Canyon occur as transverse or barchanoid dunes that form in a unidirectional wind regime that transports sand from an upwind fluvial sandbar source area to the downwind dunefield. In this scenario, the predominant wind direction follows the path of the canyon, either in the upriver or downriver direction. Under more complex directional wind regimes, floor dunefields form and are resupplied with sand from bi-modal, canyon-parallel wind directions that alternately transport sand from up- and downriver sandbars. Sankey et al. (2018a,b) found that dunefields in Grand Canyon can be classified into three general categories of sediment budgets based on sediment supply and wind directional regimes:\n\n\u2022\nAeolian dunefields with an active sediment supply and a unimodal wind regime tend to exhibit a net depositional sediment budget (e.g., Soap dunefield in Fig. 4).\n\n\n\u2022\nAeolian dunefields without an active sediment supply, but which are marked by a unimodal wind regime, tend to exhibit a net erosional sediment budget (e.g., Lees dunefield in Fig. 4).\n\n\n\u2022\nAeolian dunefields with, or without, an active sediment supply and a multimodal wind directional regime often exhibit an equilibrium sediment budget (e.g., Fossil dunefield in Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nAnalog case study objectives\nOn Earth, where remote sensing and in-situ methods can be employed to attempt to close a sediment budget, the difference between the estimates derived from the two approaches can be evaluated as:\n\n(7)\n\nSediment Budget Relative Percent Difference\n\n\n=\n\n|\n\n(\n\n\n(\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n)\n\n|\n\n\u204e\n100\n\n\n\n\nEquation (7) calculates the absolute value of the relative percent difference between sediment budgets derived by the two methods. In this analog case study, we evaluate the sediment budget relative percent difference using remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a dunefield in GC with the simplest of sediment supply and wind regime scenarios: at a site without active sediment supply and a unimodal wind regime. Our objective is to demonstrate the sediment budget relative percent differences for this simple scenario to help shed light on the potential magnitudes and complexities of sediment budget errors that might occur under these and more complex wind and sediment supply regimes elsewhere on Earth and Mars.\n\n\n3.3\nAnalog case study site and methods\nWe deployed sediment flux monitoring equipment for this case study and sequentially conducted remote sensing surveys at a dunefield located in Grand Canyon along the Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona. The Lees dunefield (Fig. 4) consists of barchanoid dunes that form in a unidirectional wind regime that formerly transported sand from an upwind fluvial sandbar source area to the downwind dunefield. Glen Canyon Dam, which was constructed in 1963 approximately 15 km upstream of Lees Ferry, allows for very little passage of river sediment from the Lake Powell reservoir to the downstream Colorado River in Grand Canyon. As a result, the Lees dunefield is sediment-starved, with limited external sediment supply from the adjacent river sandbar. The annual windy season, when most of the aeolian transport occurs in Grand Canyon is from February through April (East et al., 2016; Sankey et al., 2018a,b). The sediment budget time period for this analog case study was designed to span one of these windy seasons in the spring of 2019.\n\n3.3.1\n\u0394S\n\nIn-Situ\n\n\nWe measured sediment fluxes entering (I) and exiting (E) the Lees dunefield by using vertical arrays of sediment catchers (Big Springs Number Eight\u2122; BSNE) at the up- and downwind boundary of the dunefield. Each array consisted of four sediment catchers mounted on a pole at heights of 0.15, 0.45, 0.75, 1.15 m above ground. Catcher efficiency was estimated as 1.0 (f in Eq. (2)). The sediment catchers were deployed on February 26, 2019 and the accumulated sediment was collected once on April 3 and again on May 2, 2019. We followed the methodology described in Section 2 and Equations (2)-(5) above to calculate I, E, and \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n\n\n between Feb 26 and May 2, 2019.\n\n\n3.3.2\n\u0394S\n\nRemote Sensing\n\n\nAn Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing survey was conducted on February 28th and then repeated on May 2nd, 2019. A quadcopter UAV was preprogrammed to fly a cross-hatched grid pattern at approximately 75 m above ground level, supporting 60-percent image footprint overlap in each flight direction. The sensor was set to remain within 10-degrees of nadir during data collection. Images were captured near mid-day (11:36-12:13 and 13:07-13:46 local time respectively) to support optimal solar illumination at the site. Images were collected on a 16MP CMOS (APS-C 23.7 x 15.7 mm) color camera with an 18.3 mm prime lens. We surveyed 6 and 8, respectively, checker-board pattern ground control targets and a scale bar using a Topcon total station to tie reference data to the existing USGS geodetic network (Hazel et al., 2008). The images were processed in Agisoft\u00a9 Metashape Pro photogrammetric modeling software. A process known as \u201cgradual selection\u201d was used to refine the tie point model, increasing the positional accuracies. This processing step refines the data to the limitations of the image clarity and the software's ability to measure (base to height ratio of 1:2.3, standard deviation of 3, reprojection uncertainty of better than 0.17 pixels) supporting the best possible modeled geometric outcome. The modeled positional error for the control targets was 4.79 cm and 3.28 cm respectively, and within 0.343 pixels and 0.291 pixels respectively. Scale bar error for each model was 0.0425 cm and 0.627 cm respectively, which reflects errors in compositional accuracy as measured within the models. The refined model was then processed into a dense point cloud and DEM. The native DEM raster cell resolutions were 3.81 cm and 3.85 cm respectively and were resampled for change detection analyses at 10-cm, 1-m, and 10-m resolution to represent DEM pixel resolutions commonly available for Earth and Mars investigations.\nWe followed the methodology described in Section 2 and Equation (6) above to calculate \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n between Feb 28 and May 2, 2019, for the three pairs of resampled DEMs. \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n determined from Equation (6) doesn't account for uncertainty of the pixel-based remote sensing change detection. Therefore, we also made additional estimates of the remote sensing sediment budget using methods that exclude potentially erroneous elevation changes from the change detection results. These are generally termed significance thresholding methods and are commonly applied by geomorphologists on Earth (Wheaton et al., 2010), though not yet Mars. Please see Supplementary Material S1 for specific details about the remote sensing change detection methods (Fig. S.1.1.) and results (Fig. S.1.2.). We determined sediment budget relative percent difference (Equation (7)) as a function of the different remote sensing change detection methods at the three different DEM pixel resolutions.\n\n\n\n3.4\nAnalog case study results\n\nI determined from the in-situ sediment collectors during the 65 days they were deployed was 0.934 kg, E was 79.790 kg, and thus I-E was \u221278.857 kg indicating a net efflux of sediment from the dunefield. This finding is consistent with the observations of Sankey et al. (2018a) that the dunefield exhibits a net erosional sediment budget because it has a unimodal wind directional regime and does not have an active external source of sediment supply. The I-E value of \u221278.857 kg was determined from sediment catchers with an opening width of 1 cm and was extrapolated to the dunefield area between the influx and efflux measurements using the mean dunefield width of 68 m to calculate an estimated loss of 536,277 kg of sediment. Assuming a particle density of 2650 kg\/m3 and porosity of 40%, the \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n\n\n volume was \u2212337 m3.\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n determined for the 64-day span between the UAV remote sensing datasets was \u2212584, \u2212581, and \u2212589 m3, respectively at the 10-cm, 1-m, and 10-m DEM resolutions. Sediment budget relative percent differences were 54, 53, and 54% for \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n determined at the three DEM resolutions, respectively, relative to \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n-\n\nSitu\n\n\n\n based on Equation (7) (Fig. 5\n). However, sediment budget relative percent differences spanned a much larger range, from 3 to 138% of the in-situ budgets, when evaluated using the remote sensing sediment budgets determined from significance thresholding methods at the three DEM resolutions (Fig. 5). This is because the significance thresholding methods all resulted in smaller values of remote sensing sediment budget volumes, which is consistent with the effect of more conservative error accounting (Anderson, 2019). However, the most conservative significance thresholding method (\n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\u2212\n\nProb\n\n90\n\n\n) had the largest sediment budget difference relative to the in-situ method, probably because the former underestimated actual topographic change owing to errors of omission. In short, the significance thresholding results indicate a large range of relative percent differences, and thus large uncertainty, between remote sensing and in-situ sediment budgets; this calls into question the ability to accurately estimate the sediment budget of the dunefield with remote sensing (Fig. 5; see also Supplementary Material 1).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion and ways forward\nThe analog case study results from Grand Canyon, Earth highlight two potentially useful approaches to quantify potential error in \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n from Mars.\nFirst, the assessment of sediment budget relative percent differences at different DEM resolutions identified both an estimate (\n+\n\/\n\u2212\n) of the potential error in \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n from Mars and the importance of understanding DEM uncertainty to limit that error. Change detection without consideration of elevation uncertainty at 1-m pixel resolution resulted in 53% percent difference relative to in-situ results. By applying a significance threshold using either survey registration error or the propagated error of elevation uncertainty, the sediment budget relative percent difference may be reduced by approximately half. More conservative estimates using probability-based confidence intervals may or may not reduce sediment budget relative percent difference, as significance thresholds may exceed change (Anderson, 2019). Our results demonstrate that assessment of data uncertainty is crucial for reducing potential sediment budget errors, but careful consideration will be needed in future studies to evaluate the role of threshold significance on sediment budget estimates. For example, the sediment budget results differed between remote sensing and in-situ methods at the different DEM resolutions when significance thresholding methods were used. Kasprak et al. (2019) also detected different magnitudes of topographic changes in dunefields in the Grand Canyon when change detection was performed for elevation data interpolated at 0.1 vs. 1.0 m pixel resolution. DEM resolution for geomorphology investigations on Mars and other planetary bodies is determined by the native resolution of the images from a particular platform and sensor (e.g., HiRISE) used to derive the raster elevation dataset. However, we did find large differences between the remote sensing and in-situ method results for some of the more conservative significance thresholding approaches when the remote sensing data were resampled at the 0.1-10 m pixel resolutions (Fig. 5ab).\nSecond, independent of DEM resolution or uncertainty estimates, \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n and \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nIn\n\n\u2212\n\nsitu\n\n\n\n both predicted net erosional budgets and thus agreed on that fundamental result. However, \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n overestimated the sediment budget (i.e., estimated a more negative volume of change) compared to \u0394S\n\nIn-situ. This overestimation may be a product of low contributing sediment supply and a unimodal wind direction. Presumably, analog sites such as the Lees dunefield with very little sediment supply and a relatively consistent wind direction will erode with dunes that decrease in height as they migrate downwind (Fig. 5; Sankey et al., 2018a,b). This means that the potential for compensating elevation changes \u2013 where dunes within some portions of the dunefield increase in height while others decrease \u2013 will be low, and divergence in flux magnitudes (i.e., I-E) will be small and\/or negative (Lindsay and Ashmore, 2002; Erwin et al., 2012; Kasprak et al., 2019) though the amount of apparent erosion estimated by \u0394S\n\nRemote Sensing\n will be large (i.e., potentially a more negative number). However, sites with variable sediment supply, may both erode and aggrade (Sankey et al., 2018a,b) and have greater divergence in flux magnitudes, but also have larger remote sensing sediment budget errors as erosion and deposition over the survey interval can occur within the same areas or pixels.\nDunefields that have a unimodal wind directional regime have a clear upwind source area which may or may not \u2013 as is the case with Lees \u2013 have a supply of available sediment. The consistent directionality of sediment transport provides a higher level of confidence in in-situ measurements of sediment flux relative to sites with greater sediment supply or multimodal wind direction regime. This is because as sediment supply increases, the potential for in-situ measurement error also increases due to difficulties in capturing multiple transport pathways through a site with sediment catchers and accurately upscaling point measurements to the site scale (Zobeck et al., 2003). Multimodal wind directional regimes further complicate apparent topographic changes as the relationships between sediment transport direction and bedform orientation are complex (Rubin and Hunter, 1987) and compensating bedform elevation changes can thus be large, meaning remote sensing sediment budgets less accurately capture true sediment flux (Lindsay and Ashmore, 2002; Erwin et al., 2012; Kasprak et al., 2019). Additionally, in multimodal wind regimes, trapping of sediment by in-situ sensors less accurately reflects site-scale sediment, resulting in more error in the computation of site-scale flux (Zobeck et al., 2003; Webb et al., 2019).\nOur study focuses on evaluating remote sensing sediment budgets relative to the in-situ method, as this is the more relevant comparison for extraterrestrial geomorphology where remote sensing methods are more feasible. Thus, we don't for example, evaluate the effects of different parameterizations for estimating I and E from in-situ sediment transport data (e.g., Equations (2)-(5)). Nor do we explicitly evaluate different sample sizes or sampling locations or frequencies for the in-situ flux measurements which are necessarily integrated across space and time and extrapolated to the surveyed dimensions of the dunefield. We similarly don't evaluate different approaches for converting sediment flux values from units of mass to volume. Explicit consideration of these different sources of uncertainty for the measurement and calculation of in-situ sediment fluxes is warranted for future research, particularly for geomorphology on Earth, where it can be more relevant to use remote sensing methods as a validation (e.g., Fig. 2; Grams et al., 2013) of differing estimations of sediment budgets from in-situ methods.\nConceptually, we propose that the case study dunefield provides an endmember, or lower-bound, scenario with simple site topography and wind regime, and no sediment supply, for the relative error of remote sensing sediment budgets for chasma floor dunefields on Mars (Fig. 6\n). As complexity within topography, sediment supply, and wind regime increase, we expect sediment budget errors to increase. Though our conceptual understanding of these factors provides a way forward for interpreting extraterrestrial sediment budgets (Fig. 6), sediment budget relative percent differences at many more analog sites on Earth with a range of complexities are needed to characterize the full range of potential errors that might be expected for remote sensing sediment budgets on Mars.\nWe emphasize the potential value of future studies on Earth that measure sediment budgets using both in-situ and remote sensing techniques at analog sites with a diverse suite of wind regimes, sediment supplies, and topographic settings as well as dunefield sizes. Comparison of migration rates and dune sizes for a selection of dunefields on Mars and analog sites on Earth indicates that the Grand Canyon Lees dunefield is a reasonable analog but also that there is a need to evaluate a broader variety of analog dunefields as well (Fig. 7\n). By computing sediment budget relative percent differences across sites, relationships could be developed between site characteristics, scale, and the potential error in \n\u0394\n\n\nS\n\n\n\nRemote\n\n\n\nSensing\n\n\n\n, which is the only tractable method for sediment budgeting on Mars at present. We are not aware of any investigations that have quantified Martian aeolian dunefield sediment budgets with detailed analyses of measurement uncertainties and sediment budget error. Moreover, we are not aware of any previous investigations that have compared sediment budgets for Martian dunefields to analogs on Earth using the remote sensing methodology currently available for Mars, or the in-situ methodology commonly employed on Earth that may one day be feasible for Mars. By comparing sediment budgets derived from in-situ measurements of sediment fluxes and from remote sensing measurements at many more analog sites on Earth, the aeolian research community could gain an understanding of the errors of the remote sensing method which is used by investigators on Mars. This improved understanding could also enhance the ability to quantify aeolian abrasion from remote sensing and its role in landscape evolution on Mars (Bridges et al., 2012; Chojnacki et al., 2018). Such comparative planetology research would improve our ability to quantify sediment budgets on Mars \u2013 and, in the future, other planetary environments where high-resolution topographic data are or will be available \u2013 as well as directly improve investigators' ability to interpret Martian landscape evolution related to climate, weather, and geologic history.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJoel B.

It is a solid sphere composed of an iron and nickel alloy with a radius of approximately 1217.5 km. Despite its remote location, the inner core has an essential role in the origin of many dynamic processes; in particular, its solidification and the resulting release of latent heat, drive convection in the outer core and thus sustain Earth's magnetic field. This latent heat also contributes to the heat flux at the core mantle boundary and represents an important driver of mantle convection.\nAlthough mineral physics provides us with estimates of the composition and crystalline properties of the inner core, only seismology provides direct measurements of its elastic structure. One of the most striking observations is that the inner core appears to be anisotropic, whereby the velocity of a seismic wave varies depending on its direction of propagation. In the inner core, this anomalous structure is observed in the fact that waves travelling aligned to Earth's rotation axis arrive earlier than waves travelling in the equatorial plane. Later studies showed that these body wave observations are best matched by cylindrical anisotropy (Morelli et al., 1986), which also explains observations of anomalous zonal splitting of inner core sensitive free oscillations (Woodhouse et al., 1986).\nAs global seismic data coverage increased, seismic investigations began to resolve 3D lateral variations and radial heterogeneity in the inner core. Hemispherical differences were first proposed by Tanaka and Hamaguchi (1997) and later confirmed by many other studies (Niu and Wen 2001; Waszek and Deuss 2011; Lythgoe et al. 2014; Burdick et al. 2019). These hemispherical differences are characterised by a eastern hemisphere with weak anisotropy and fast isotropic velocity, and a western hemisphere with strong anisotropy and low isotropic velocity. The outermost layer of the inner core has been proposed as isotropic, both in the east and west (Wen and Niu, 2002; Waszek and Deuss, 2011). Furthermore, an innermost inner core (IMIC) with a different fast or slow symmetry axes may exist, although the details remain unconfirmed regarding the exact direction of the slow axes, its regional distribution or its origins (Beghein and Trampert, 2003; Ishii and Dziewo\u0144ski, 2003; Sun and Song, 2008b; Lythgoe et al., 2014; Frost and Romanowicz, 2019). Sun and Song (2008b) produced an impressive early 3D tomographic model of the inner core using differential travel times. Their model recovered many of the main features in the inner core that we still see today, including isotropic quasi hemispheres, an inner most inner core and strong anisotropy in one quasi hemisphere.\nOne limitation in interpreting seismic body wave observations in terms of distinct regional features (like hemispheres) is that the resultant models strongly depend on the chosen parameterisation. Furthermore, trade-offs exist between different structures depending on the model parameterisation. Not accounting for lateral variations may explain why some studies find a sharp change in anisotropy at an apparent IMIC (Stephenson et al., 2020; Frost and Romanowicz, 2019), while others find a gradual IMIC boundary, if it exists at all (Lythgoe et al., 2014). In addition, hemispheres are often assumed to be defined by meridians and features such as the innermost inner core usually have a constant radius, which may be overly simplifying their shapes.\nAnother major challenge when imaging the inner core is removing the influence of mantle heterogeneity. A particular subset of raypaths, travelling from the South Sandwich Islands (SSI) to Alaska, have been noted to travel anomalously fast. It has been debated to what extent these travel times reflect inner core structure or mantle structure (Tkal\u010di\u0107 2010; Frost et al. 2020; Brett and Deuss 2020). To address the issue of mantle heterogeneity, we use multiple tomographic mantle models to assess unaccounted for mantle structure, and we develop inner core models which both include and exclude the South Sandwich Islands data.\nIn this study, we apply a transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion technique (Bodin and Sambridge, 2009) to a large high-quality body wave data set to make a 3D model of inner core velocity and anisotropy. We consider our model to be the next step in inner core tomography, with the main difference that we use a transdimensional Monte Carlo approach and that we can now utilise significantly more data due to the increased coverage of seismic stations and events. The advantage of a transdimensional MCMC methodology over an inversion using a static parameterisation, is that the parameterisation of the model space evolves with the Markov chain and is not predetermined. Thus, the model parameterisation is driven by the data itself, with no prior assumptions on the parameterisation, such as the existence of an IMIC or hemispheres. Previously, Burdick et al. (2019) and Peji\u0107 et al. (2019) used a transdimensional MCMC approach to image a single layer of inner core velocity and attenuation respectively. These previous studies were 2D spherical surface inversions and in this paper we go further by conducting the first fully 3D transdimensional MCMC for the inner core, which allows us to resolve jointly for both lateral and radial variations in P-wave anisotropy, which is essential to answering questions on the mechanisms and causes of anisotropy in the inner core.\n\n\n2\nData and pre-processing\nWe image the inner core using the phase PKPdf, which travels the mantle, outer core, and inner core as a compressional body wave. PKPdf is used either individually, or in combination with a reference phase (PKPcd, PKPbc, PKPab), which only traverses the mantle and outer core. We employ independent datasets from three previous studies consisting of 1603 PKPbc-PKPdf, 627 PKPab-PKPdf (Brett and Deuss, 2020), and 3102 PKPcd-PKPdf (Waszek and Deuss, 2011) differential travel time measurements, and 2344 absolute PKPdf arrival times (Lythgoe et al., 2014). The arrival times of Brett and Deuss (2020) and Lythgoe et al. (2014) are visual picks, while Waszek and Deuss (2011) used a combination of both visual inspection and cross correlation between the inner core and outer core phases. Combining these datasets provides good coverage of the inner core from its surface to 200 km radius (see Fig. 1\n). We will need to consider the direction of travel of the PKPdf raypath through the inner core to image anisotropy. For cylindrical anisotropy, we describe the direction of travel by the angle \u03b6 defined as the angle between the PKPdf raypath in the inner core and Earth's rotation axis. We have good raypath coverage for polar raypaths (defined as raypaths with \n\u03b6\n<\n\n\n35\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n), which is important for constraining inner core cylindrical anisotropy.\nFollowing the methodology of Creager (1992) we define the fractional differential travel time as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nt\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPref\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPdf\n\n\n)\n\n\ndata\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPref\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPdf\n\n\n)\n\n\nModel\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPref\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPdf\n\n\n)\n\n\ndata\n\n\n is the observed difference in arrival time between a reference phase and the PKPdf phase, \n\n\n(\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPref\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nt\n\n\nPKPdf\n\n\n)\n\n\nModel\n\n\n is the theoretical arrival time difference predicted by a model, and t is the inner core travel time of the PKPdf raypath as predicted by a reference model. We use the 1D reference model AK135 (Kennett et al., 1995). For absolute travel times, we remove the reference phase from the above equation.\nMultiple studies have highlighted the significant influence of mantle structure on inner core travel times (Tkal\u010di\u0107 2010; Frost et al. 2020; Brett and Deuss 2020). Mantle corrections will be especially large for absolute travel time measurements, but may also be important for differential travel time data. To correct for the influence of mantle structure and estimate any corresponding uncertainties introduced we calculate differential travel times using six different global P-wave models, integrated across the 1D raypaths from AK135. The global P-wave models used are: UUP07 (Amaru, 2007), MITP08 (Li et al., 2008), GyPSuM, LLNL-G3Dv3 (Simmons et al., 2012), SAW642AN (Panning and Romanowicz, 2006) and SPani (Tesoniero et al., 2015). This results in six synthetic travel times for each PKPcd, PKPbc, PKPab and PKPdf travel time observation in our data set, from which we calculate six different values of \u03b4t (Figs. S2-S3). Inspection of Figs. S2-S3 reveals a significant uniform negative shift for the mantle-corrected absolute PKPdf travel times. We expect that this shift is due to 1D mantle structure that differs from the reference model used (AK135); we remove it by subtracting the mean of the mantle-corrected equatorial data from each measurement. Using the six \n\n\n\u03b4\nt\n\n\nt\n\n\n values for each data point for each model, we determine the mean and standard deviation, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n. The standard deviation \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n is used as a starting estimate of the noise introduced into the data by the mantle structure which is then extended through hierarchical sampling (see section 4.3).\nWhile the mantle corrections will do a good job of correcting large scale lower mantle structure, strong velocity perturbations locally around events or seismic stations will not be as well resolved by these global tomographic models. However, we assume that such differences will be removed by the differential travel time methodology, because the primary and reference phases are most similar near the source and receiver. As expected, the PKPab-PKPdf and absolute PKPdf data are more affected by mantle structure than the PKPcd-PKPdf and PKPbc-PKPdf data (Fig. 2\n). Regardless, the mantle corrections in all datasets are an order of magnitude less than the measurements themselves.\n\n\n3\nThe forward problem\nFor a fast direction parallel to Earth's axis of rotation, cylindrical body wave anisotropy in the inner core is defined as follows (Creager, 1992)\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\nt\n\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u03b4\nv\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\na\n+\nb\n\n\ncos\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n+\nc\n\n\ncos\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n where \n\n\n\u03b4\nt\n\n\nt\n\n\n is equivalent to the velocity anomaly \n\n\n\u03b4\nv\n\n\nv\n\n\n (assuming low attenuation in the inner core). The difference in the velocity of equatorial raypaths relative to the reference model (AK135), \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ne\nq\n\n\n, is given by a in Equation (2). The amount of anisotropy, \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n, is defined as the velocity difference between polar and equatorial raypaths, given by \nb\n+\nc\n. This measure of anisotropy is strictly for cylindrical anisotropy, and assumes that the slow and fast directions are perpendicular. The b and c parameters of Equation (2) are related to components of the elastic tensor, \n\n\nC\n\n\ni\nj\n\n\n, which describes the anisotropy of a medium by \nb\n=\n(\n\n\nC\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nC\n\n\n11\n\n\n)\n\/\n2\n\n\nC\n\n\n11\n\n\n and \nc\n=\n(\n4\n\n\nC\n\n\n44\n\n\n+\n2\n\n\nC\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nC\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nC\n\n\n33\n\n\n)\n\/\n8\n\n\nC\n\n\n11\n\n\n (Creager, 1992). From the model parameters a, b and c we calculate the isotropic velocity, or Voigt average velocity (Lythgoe et al., 2014) commonly interpreted by mineral physicists;\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ni\ns\no\n\n\n=\na\n+\n\n\nb\n\n\n3\n\n\n+\n\n\nc\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n Equation (2) reveals that the slowest velocity direction is not restricted to an angle of \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n, but depends on combinations of b and c, thus can be any angle between \n0\n\u2212\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n. The slowest angle is obtained by differentiating Equation (2) and calculating its maximum value, following Lythgoe et al. (2014), which results in the following:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n=\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u2061\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n2\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Some variations in \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n are statistically insignificant: it is possible to have a large range of values of \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n but with minimal absolute velocity differences between \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n and \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n. To only keep statistically significant values of \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n, we use a tolerance condition, such that the difference between \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n velocity and that at \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n must be greater than 0.5% of the reference velocity. We will present our model showing variations in \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ne\nq\n\n\n, \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ni\ns\no\n\n\n, \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n, and \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n. It is important to note that throughout this paper we define anisotropy to be the difference between the polar and the equatorial velocity (as is conventional for body wave studies of the inner core). However, in some regions of our model the difference between the polar and equatorial velocity is small (\n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n\u223c\n1.0\n%\n) while the difference between the \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n direction and the \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n is stronger (\u223c2.0%). These regions should still be thought of as anisotropic even though the value of \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n is small.\nFor a single raypath with \u03b6 and set of coefficients (\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n) we predict the normalised differential travel time using Equation (1). However, this treats the inner core as a homogeneous volume, whereas we are interested in 3D variations. For an inner core with multiple sub-volumes, we split the ray into different portions for each model sub-volume travelled, resulting in the following linear forward problem:\n\n(5)\n\nGm\n=\n\n\nd\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\nG\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n1\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n1\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n1\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n1\n,\n2\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u22ef\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n2\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n2\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n2\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n2\n,\n2\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u22ef\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n3\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n3\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n3\n,\n1\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u2061\n(\n\u03b6\n)\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n3\n,\n2\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u22ef\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\u22f1\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\nm\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8)\n\nd\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nt\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nt\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\nt\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n where G is the sensitivity kernel matrix which has the same number of rows as the number of travel times in our dataset, and the same number of columns as the length of vector m. \n\n\nA\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n within G is a value between 0 and 1 describing the fraction of raypath i which travels through volume j and \n\n\n\u2211\n\n\nj\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n=\n1\n for a total of N volumes.

Note that the inner core travel time \n\n\nt\n\n\ni\n\n\n has been moved from the left hand side in Equation (2) to the right hand side, and is now part of matrix G. In a static MCMC, the parameterisation of the sensitivity kernel matrix G remains constant, forming a fixed forward problem. In the transdimensional MCMC, the sensitivity kernel matrix G changes at each step of every new model parameterisation.\nCalculating the \n\n\nA\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n terms is a function of the raypath discretisation and the basis functions used. For this study, we use fixed raypaths as modelled by AK135 using the Taup Toolkit (Crotwell et al., 1999) and assume the inner core is spherical (note that we do correct our data for ellipticity using the methodology of Dziewonski and Gilbert, 1976). We do not adjust the raypaths in our model using 3D raytracing. The transdimensional inversion is already a computationally expensive non-linear inversion and tests incorporating 3D raytracing through an anisotropic model significantly increased the time taken to approximate the posterior making it unfeasible. Therefore, we decided that for this study it was sufficient to use fixed raypaths and assess the uncertainties in the travel times through hierarchical sampling.\nThe basis functions are 3D Voronoi cells, which provide a fast method of tessellating a domain with non-overlapping volumes.\n\n\n4\nThe inverse problem\n\n4.1\nBayes' theorem\nWe solve the inverse problem using a Bayesian approach, where we do not consider one single solution but instead regard the solution to be a collection of models (an \u2018ensemble\u2019) from which uncertainties can be determined. In practice, the Bayesian approach combines prior information on a model space with data to produce a posterior probability distribution. Following Bodin and Sambridge (2009), the posterior probability \np\n(\nm\n|\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n)\n is given by\n\n(9)\n\np\n(\nm\n|\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n)\n\u221d\np\n(\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n|\nm\n)\np\n(\nm\n)\n\n\n where the likelihood function \np\n(\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n|\nm\n)\n is the probability of observing a set of data given a set of model parameters. The prior function \np\n(\nm\n)\n describes our knowledge of the model space before considering the data. The posterior \np\n(\nm\n|\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n)\n represents how the data and our prior knowledge combine, providing us with the probability that a given set of model parameters are true.\n\n\n4.2\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo\nWe then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the posterior probability distribution of our data-model system (Cowles and Carlin, 1996). For a given prior probability and data, we evaluate the forward problem over many proposed models, with each proposed model related to the previous model with a small random perturbation. After randomly perturbing an initial model, we use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hastings 1970) to probabilistically accept or reject perturbations. The Metropolis-Hastings criteria ensure that accepted models are representative of the posterior probability distribution.\n\n\n4.3\nLikelihood and hierarchical noise\nThe likelihood function, \np\n(\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n|\nm\n)\n, describes how well a set of model parameters reproduces the data:\n\n(10)\n\np\n(\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n|\nm\n)\n\u221d\nexp\n\u2061\n\n\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n(\nm\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n where \u03d5 is the least squares misfit of a model normalised by data noise. We use an L2 norm which is frequently used in seismic tomography:\n\n(11)\n\n\u03d5\n(\nm\n)\n=\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n where \n\n\nd\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n is the synthetic data predicted by the model m (calculated using Equation (5)), \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n is the hierarchical parameter and is the estimated data noise. \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n has a profound influence on the MCMC because the algorithm will only fit the data to within this noise limit. Thus, \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n is analogous to the damping parameter in a damped least squares inversion. However unlike the damping parameter, it is possible to assess the value of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n from the data itself using hierarchical methods. We separate \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n into \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n for each data type, since the four data types (PKPcd, PKPbc, PKPab differential travel times and absolute PKPdf travel times) have different levels of noise. For each individual \u03b4t data point we use the mantle noise, \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n, estimated from the six global tomographic models (see section 2) as a minimum level of noise. From this, each measurement then has its own \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nd\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n. The misfit then becomes:\n\n(12)\n\n\u03d5\n(\nm\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nd\n\n\ns\ny\nn\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nd\n\n\no\nb\ns\n\n\n)\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n,\nn\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hierarchical parameter \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n is not a term that we choose, but is sampled as an additional perturbation step in the MCMC, which is also accepted following the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In this way, \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n estimates the noise by examining contradictions within the data itself, and combining this with the prior estimate of the data noise from the tomographic models. For example, if two or more observations that sample the same region of the model are contradictory then they will be fit poorly and drive the hierarchical parameter to higher values indicating a greater level of uncertainty in the data. This approach handles data uncertainties thoroughly, using the estimates of \n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n from the tomographic models to provide a minimum misfit on individual data points, then using the \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nD\na\nt\na\nT\ny\np\ne\n\n\n terms to maintain an overview of the noise of each subset of data. Substituting Equation (12) into Equation (10) provides us with the first term on the right hand side of Equation (9).\n\n\n4.4\nPrior\nThe prior, \np\n(\nm\n)\n (the second term on the right hand side of Equation (9)), is a probability distribution function representing any knowledge on the physical system before data is considered. We use Gaussian probability distributions for model parameters, a, b and c with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation, \u03c3, of 0.1 (or 10% velocity perturbations relative to AK135). That is, for the ith a parameter we have in our model we have:\n\n(13)\n\np\n(\n\n\na\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\n=\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\nexp\n\u2061\n(\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\ni\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c3\n\n\n)\n\n\n with the same equation for b and c, giving a prior of the form:\n\n(14)\n\np\n(\nm\n)\n=\n\n\u220f\n\ni\n\n\np\n(\n\n\na\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\np\n(\n\n\nb\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\np\n(\n\n\nc\n\n\ni\n\n\n)\n.\n\n\n This prior reflects current knowledge on inner core structure while not restricting the size of the model space prohibitively. For example, it has the capacity to incorporate anisotropy (\nb\n+\nc\n) of 10% in our model. We consider Gaussian priors to be more appropriate than uniform priors as uniform priors can overly restrict the size of the model space.\n\n\n4.5\nTransdimensional model proposals\nIn a traditional MCMC inversion the parameterisation of the model space is static (i.e. the number and locations of the Voronoi cells remains the same across all iterations) and defined prior to the inversion. Thus, only the model parameters a, b and c within each Voronoi cell would be perturbed. However, in our transdimensional MCMC, the data defines how the model is parameterised through perturbing the number and locations of the Voronoi cells. Thus, the transdimensional method samples models with different complexity (i.e. number of model parameters and volumes) resulting in an ensemble of varying dimensioned models that plausibly explain the observations. This is implemented as a \u2018reductionist\u2019 methodology, i.e. if the dataset can be fit equally well with 10 volumes instead of 11, then the final ensemble will include more models with 10 volumes than 11.\nThe velocity perturbations to the model parameters a, b and c are described in Appendix B.1. The additional perturbations to the parameterisation of the model space require three more perturbation types: move (moving cells), birth (generating new cells), and death (removing cells) and are described in detail in Appendix B.2-B.4.\n\n\n\n5\nEnsemble analysis\nWe applied the transdimensional MCMC algorithm (section 4.5) to our data (section 2) and ran 20 chains for 4,000,000 iterations with an acceptance rate (the percentage of accepted perturbations) of 30.5%. Fig. 3\na shows how the misfit changes as a function of iteration in the inversion for all 20 chains. The misfit drops rapidly in the first 200,000 iterations before reaching a misfit minimum; the transdimensional algorithm then samples models around this minimum value.\nOnce the inversion has completed the desired number of iterations, the models are collected into an ensemble from which statistics are calculated. We remove the influence of the starting model by excluding the first third of all iterations in the ensemble of models; the so-called \u2018burn in\u2019. It is also common practice to \u2018thin\u2019 the chain by only retaining every 100th model, which ensures that each model in an ensemble is independent. Following \u2018burn in\u2019 and \u2018thinning\u2019 leaves a final ensemble of 533,380 models. For further discussion regarding appropriate values for the \u2018burn in\u2019 and \u2018thinning\u2019 we refer the reader to Cowles and Carlin (1996).\nFor an MCMC investigation, it is important to ensure that the model sampling has converged, whereby the model space has been sufficiently explored and the models are no longer evolving substantially. To assess convergence, we examine the number of volumes in each chain as a function of iteration (Fig. 3b). The number of volumes across all chains drops rapidly within the first 10,000 iterations, as the starting model is refined and Voronoi cells which do not reduce misfit are removed. After this initial reduction of volumes, the MCMC algorithm better assesses the noise level within the data, and the number of volumes across all chains starts to increase before flattening out after 1,000,000 iterations. For the next 3,000,000 iterations, the mean number of volumes across all chains does not change substantially, implying convergence. After convergence, the average model misfit has reduced from 1.0 to 0.55, and the models have between 23 and 38 volumes.\nWe also investigate the average hierarchical noise parameters for each data type (section 4.3) from the 533,380 models in our final ensemble (Fig. 3c). As expected, the PKPcd-PKPdf data has the lowest noise level with 0.29 s on average of uncertainty in each measurement, followed by PKPbc-PKPdf data with a noise level of 0.63 s. Finally, the PKPab-PKPdf data and absolute PKPdf data show the largest levels of noise with similar values of approximately 0.95 s. Thus, the hierarchical sampling found the PKPcd-PKPdf data to have the lowest noise level, and will fit those observations more closely than the PKPab-PKPdf and absolute PKPdf data. From this analysis we expect that the top of the inner core is the best resolved region of our model due to the low noise level in the PKPcd-PKPdf data and the fact that we have more data sensitive to the top of the inner core than the centre of the inner core.\n\n\n6\nResults\nOur final model was generated by calculating the mean and standard deviations of four different model parameters from the a, b and c values of the 533,380 models in our ensemble: the equatorial velocity (\n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ne\nq\n\n\n), the isotropic or Voigt average velocity (\n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ni\ns\no\n\n\n), the anisotropic velocity difference (\n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n), and the angle of slowest direction (\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n) (see section 3). Models in our ensemble will contain different numbers of Voronoi cells at different locations and these individual models will contain sharp boundaries. However when we average across all 533,380 models the boundaries will not be in exactly the same place in every model, meaning that the average model can contain smoothly varying and irregular shaped boundaries.\nWe will explore our results in terms of large-scale general observations that have been seen before, including the isotropic hemispheres (section 6.1), the anisotropic zone (section 6.2) and the inner most inner core (section 6.3), but mainly focus on the finer-scale details which have become obvious because of our transdimensional approach.\n\n6.1\nIsotropic hemispheres\nOur model confirms the previously found hemispherical pattern with seismic P-waves travelling anomalously fast in the \u2018eastern hemisphere\u2019 of the inner core and anomalously slow in the \u2018western hemisphere\u2019. This is evident in maps of equatorial velocity throughout the inner core (Fig. 4\na-c), and at the top of the inner core in isotropic velocity (Fig. 4g). The hemispherical pattern is also clearly visible in cross sections through the equatorial plane (Fig. 5\na,c) and meridional cross sections through the North and South pole (Fig. 6\na,c). This is in agreement with numerous previous studies (Tanaka and Hamaguchi 1997; Niu and Wen 2001; Waszek and Deuss 2011; Lythgoe et al. 2014; Burdick et al. 2019; Brett and Deuss 2020). We avoid describing the hemisphere boundaries using single meridians because the hemisphere boundaries are not straight lines through the poles; this is most visible in the equatorial velocity at the ICB around southern Africa and Hawaii (Fig. 4a.)\nIt is interesting to note that the hemispherical pattern in the equatorial velocity (Fig. 5a and 6a) persists and the magnitude of the equatorial velocity increases with depth in the eastern hemisphere. The advantage of our use of the transdimensional approach, is that we are not limited to simple hemispherical shapes anymore and so are now able to identify regional heterogeneity within the hemispheres. Further complexity is particularly visible in the meridional cross section (Fig. 6a), which reveals that the boundary separating the fast and slow equatorial velocities appears sharp and undulating. Some faster equatorial velocities associated with the eastern hemisphere encroach on the slower velocities of the western hemisphere. These new observations would be challenging to identify robustly without using a transdimensional methodology, as it would be difficult to know the extent to which the final model was influenced by the initial fixed parameterisation.\nComparing our model of the equatorial velocity to that of Burdick et al. (2019) we see good overall agreement in the location of the hemisphere boundaries, but with some extra complexity, this is due to the fact that we also solve for the 3D velocity structure and have more data both of which will influence the location of the boundaries at the ICB.\nThe hemispherical pattern in the isotropic velocity is present until about 60-170 km depth below the ICB (Fig. 4g, 5c and 6c), with boundaries between slow \u2018west\u2019 and fast \u2018east\u2019 located approximately at 170\u2218W and 30\u2218E in broad agreement with previous studies (Tanaka and Hamaguchi 1997; Waszek and Deuss 2011; Burdick et al. 2019). The reason that the isotropic velocity difference does not persist deeper in the inner core, is because the isotropic velocity is a Voigt average of the velocities in all directions. Although the hemispherical variations persist in the equatorial velocity with depth, the contribution of anisotropy (i.e. higher polar velocities) causes the isotropic velocity to lose its hemispherical pattern deeper than 60-170 km below the ICB (Fig. 7\na).\n\n\n6.2\nAnisotropic zone\nIn agreement with previous studies (i.e. Tanaka and Hamaguchi 1997; Niu and Wen 2001; Lythgoe et al. 2014; Brett and Deuss 2020), our model also contains a strong anisotropic zone in the west where inner core seismic P-waves travelling in the north-south or polar direction travel faster than waves that travel in the east-west or equatorial direction. The lateral extent of the western anisotropic zone is clearly visible in maps of the anisotropic velocity difference (Fig. 4n-o) at 400 and 800 km radius and also in cross-sections through our model (Fig. 5e and 6e). The inner core displays very little anisotropy near the ICB (Fig. 4m), with the exception of a strong patch with high uncertainty around South America, similar in location to a high uncertainty region found in Peji\u0107 et al. (2019).\nA 1D profile through our model (Fig. 7a) furthermore shows that indeed anisotropy is weak at the top of the inner core (0 to 1%) and confirms strong anisotropy to be located within the western hemisphere approximately between 50 and 1100 km radius, and only weak anisotropy (\n<\n0.5\n%\n) in the eastern hemisphere. The anisotropic strength increases rapidly with depth, reaching a maximum of 7.2% in the western hemisphere. The radius of the transition to strong anisotropy in this region occurs between 1170 km and 1050 km (Fig. 7a). It is difficult to define more precisely this radius due to a lack of raypaths with turning points between 1110 km and 1060 km (Blom et al., 2015), resulting in a partial null space. This lack of data is reflected in the standard deviation (Fig. 5f), which shows a broad region of high uncertainty at the top of the anisotropic zone.\n\nTanaka and Hamaguchi (1997) described the anisotropic zone as being a \u2018quasi-hemisphere\u2019, i.e. it does not precisely span 180\u2218 of longitude. Indeed, we also observe that the anisotropic zone does not span 180\u2218 but runs between 170\u2218W and 30\u2218E (Fig. 5e), spanning a width of 200\u2218 in broad agreement with previous models (Sun and Song 2008a; Irving and Deuss 2011; Lythgoe et al. 2014).\nMost importantly, because of our transdimensional approach we do not prescribe simple hemispherical shapes; this enabled us to find that the anisotropic zone does not continue all the way to the south pole. Instead, we observe for the first time that the western anisotropic zone is largely confined to the northern hemisphere (Fig. 6e). The anisotropy at the South pole of the inner core at 800 km radius is 2% with an uncertainty of 1.5%, while the anisotropy around North America is 8% with an uncertainty of 2% (Fig. 6e) meaning that within the bounds of uncertainty in our model the South pole has significantly lower anisotropy than the region around North America. This regional feature would have been difficult to map using traditional seismic tomography employing fixed parameterisations, and has important implications for models of inner core growth (section 7). Given that this region of strong anisotropy does not span half the inner core in either longitude or latitude, we use the descriptor of an \u2018anisotropic zone\u2019 (instead of hemisphere).\nWe conducted a resolution test, to ensure the concentration of anisotropy in the northern part of the western hemisphere was not an artefact of imperfect data coverage. To do this, we ran an inversion using synthetic data for a known synthetic model, containing simple hemispheres (with 8% anisotropy and 0% equatorial velocity in the west and 0% anisotropy and 2% equatorial velocity in the east) spanning all latitudes and a spherical IMIC (with 0.5% anisotropy and 1% equatorial velocity) located at the centre of the model (Figs. S9-S11). From this model we generated synthetic data using our real raypaths and added realistic Gaussian noise. The same transdimensional inversion was then conducted on the synthetic data as for the real data. We reproduced all major features from the synthetic model reliably (Figs. S12-S15), including an anisotropic hemisphere across all latitudes. This confirms that if the anisotropic region in the west of the inner core spanned all latitudes our data would be able to recover this feature.\nWe also ran a separate inversion excluding the particular subset of raypaths travelling from the South Sandwich Islands to Alaska (Figs. S16-S19). These raypaths appear to travel anomalously fast, and it has been debated to what extent these travel times reflect regional-scale inner core structure versus mantle contamination (Tkal\u010di\u0107 2010; Frost et al. 2020; Brett and Deuss 2020). Our model excluding SSI data shows the same main features, in particular that the western anisotropic zone is still located primarily in the northern hemisphere. Thus, we conclude that the effect of the SSI data on our inversion is minimal and that the western anisotropic zone is indeed confined to the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n6.3\nOffset IMIC\nThe inner most inner core (IMIC) has been defined in previous studies as a anisotropic region where the slowest direction (i.e. \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n of equation (4)) is at an angle smaller than 90 degrees from the fastest direction. \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n is harder to constrain than \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\ne\nq\n\n\n and \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n since variations in \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n produce a more subtle effect on P-wave travel times. Despite this, we detect a clear region in which \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n is \n\n\n55\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n; this is most notable in the cross-sections through our model (Figs. 5g and 6g). Within this region, \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n (the difference between purely polar paths with \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n and equatorial paths with \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n is small (\n\u223c\n1\n%\n). What matters here instead, is that the difference in velocity between polar paths with \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n0\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n and paths with \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n is as large as 2% and therefore, despite having a small value of \n\u03b4\n\n\nV\n\n\na\nn\ni\n\n\n this region should still be considered anisotropic.\nInterestingly, it appears not to be a spherical feature at the centre of the inner core. In fact, the centre of the IMIC in our model is offset from the centre of the inner core by approximately 400 km, and our IMIC is contained within the eastern hemisphere (Fig. 7b and Fig. 8\nc). Our \u2018non-spherical\u2019 or offset IMIC appears to reconcile previous differing IMIC models (Ishii and Dziewo\u0144ski, 2003; Beghein and Trampert, 2003; Sun and Song, 2008b; Lythgoe et al., 2014; Frost and Romanowicz, 2019). The model of Sun and Song (2008b) was an early 3D inner core model which observed an IMIC, in their model the parameterisation of the IMIC was fixed, with the IMIC in the central 600 km of the inner core. However, Sun and Song (2008b) also ran a model without a fixed IMIC. They concluded that their model with and without a fixed IMIC was approximately the same and that the IMIC was spherical. However, looking at their model again it seems possible that they were already seeing evidence of an offset IMIC but did not have the data at the time to be certain. Lythgoe et al. (2014) went further and proposed that the IMIC is in fact part of a larger hemispherical pattern which is in effect what we still see in our model today with more data and a more advanced technique.\nWe ensured that this offset is not an artefact of data coverage by running two synthetic tests. In one test we included a central spherical IMIC in our synthetic model (Figs. S9-S11) and produced synthetic data. After running a transdimensional inversion with this synthetic data we were able to resolve this regional feature (Figs. S12-S15), showing that if the IMIC was spherical our data would be able to resolve this. In the second synthetic test we used an offset IMIC which was only present in the eastern hemisphere (Figs. S20-S21) and we were also able to fully recover this synthetic model after running a transdimensional inversion (Figs. S22-S23).\n\n\n6.4\nSummary\nSummarising the findings from our model, we identify three robust and particularly interesting features in our model:\n\n1.\nStrong anisotropy is isolated to a zone within the western hemisphere. The anisotropy is strongest north of the equator and weakens to virtually no anisotropy near the south pole. The top of the inner core near the ICB displays very little anisotropy, however, anisotropy increases sharply below 200 km depth in the west.\n\n\n2.\nWe interpret a region with \n\n\n\u03b6\n\n\ns\nl\no\nw\n\n\n=\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n, located primarily in the eastern hemisphere at a radius less than 700 km as the IMIC, with the centre of the IMIC offset from the centre of the inner core by 400 km.\n\n\n3.\nEquatorial and isotropic velocity anomalies are separated into two hemispheres, with a slow western hemisphere and a fast eastern hemisphere. The isotropic velocity difference between the hemispheres is present in the top 60-170 km of the inner core, and disappears at greater depth. The hemispherical pattern in equatorial velocity, on the other hand, persists to the centre of the inner core with the equatorial velocity increasing with depth in the eastern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nGeodynamic implications\nRelating our seismic observations to geodynamical processes in the inner core is challenging due to the multiple mechanisms proposed to explain the formation of anisotropy and the generation of hemispheres. It is now widely accepted that anisotropy is caused by the alignment of iron crystals, which occurs either during solidification or afterwards through texturing. However, the phase of iron which is stable at inner core conditions remains debated. At inner core temperatures and pressures iron takes the form of hcp (hexagonal close packed), bcc (body centred cubic), or fcc (face centred cubic) crystals. Each phase displays varying intrinsic anisotropy, although the magnitude of anisotropy observed seismically also depends on the degree of crystal alignment. In order to test if our seismic observations would be able to constrain the phase of iron, we calculated the anisotropy of a single crystal of each phase of iron at inner conditions using values obtained by ab initio simulations from Vo\u010dadlo (2007) and Martorell et al. (2015) and calculated the corresponding seismic travel times (see Fig. S7). The precise magnitude of anisotropy of these phases of iron at inner core temperatures and pressures remains an open question and while hcp iron seems the most likely candidate to account for observed inner core anisotropy, fcc iron is yet to be ruled out. Details on calculating the velocity characteristics of single crystals of iron can be found in Appendix B.5.\nTo facilitate the comparison between the single crystal anisotropy from the mineral physics and the anisotropy variations in our models, we used the mean a, b, and c parameters from our models for three different locations and plot the corresponding predicted fractional travel times (Fig. 9\na). We select locations from the western anisotropic zone (90\u2218W, 0\u2218N, 800 km radius), the IMIC (90\u2218E, 0\u2218N, 100 km radius), and the eastern hemisphere (90\u2218E, 0\u2218N, ICB). The western zone clearly exhibits strong cylindrical anisotropy, whereby polar raypaths are 5.9% faster than equatorial. There is negligible anisotropy in the eastern hemisphere (\n<\n0.5\n%\n), and rays which travel in a polar direction are slower than equatorial rays. In the IMIC, the equatorial and polar velocities are similar; the slowest direction is oriented at \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n, with a velocity decrease of almost 2% relative to the polar velocity.\nThe anisotropy in the western zone (Fig. 9a) appears most similar to the anisotropy predicted for a single hcp crystal with symmetry axis aligned N-S (Fig. 9b), while anisotropy in the IMIC is more complex. Polar raypaths passing through the IMIC are only slightly faster than the equatorial raypaths; the largest travel time difference is instead between the slowest direction (at \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n) and the equatorial and polar directions. This anomalous anisotropy could be caused by the dominance of the bcc or fcc iron phases with a tilted fast symmetry axis. For example, If we align the anisotropy symmetry axis with the fastest direction through a bcc or fcc crystal (which is at \n\u03b6\n=\n\n\n54\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n, see Fig. S7) then we get the predicted travel times shown in Fig. 9c. The travel times for fcc and bcc (Fig. 9c) bear a resemblance to the anisotropy we observe in the IMIC (Fig. 9a). It is important to note, that this analysis is an approximation as we are assuming that the anisotropy of a large volume made of many crystals can be described by a single crystal with 100% alignment relative to Earth's axis of rotation. We are, however, making this comparison to encourage further research into the possibility that seismic anisotropy within different regions in the inner core could be explained by different phases of iron.\nAnisotropic phases of iron, by themselves, do not account for the observed pattern of inner core anisotropy. The crystals must be aligned in a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) or alternatively in a shape preferred orientation (SPO), as a texture of randomly oriented anisotropic crystals would appear isotropic overall. Given a particular phase of iron, the question arises how this LPO is generated, and which mechanism(s) result in a heterogeneous distribution of this LPO. LPOs are commonly caused by post-solidification deformation, for the inner core one possible deformation mechanism would involve induced stresses causing axis symmetric flow, resulting in iron crystals aligning with this flow. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to create such texturing, including topographic relaxation (also known as equatorial growth, Yoshida et al. (1996)), whereby preferential growth at the equator of the inner core causes flow toward the poles due to geostatic forces. An alternative mechanism involves Maxwell stress or Lorentz forces induced by the magnetic field, causing deformation strongly influenced by outer core flow (Karato 1999; Buffett and Wenk 2001). It is likely that a combination of these mechanisms is required to explain the observed seismic complexity. For example, models of topographic relaxation typically produce symmetric flow around the equator which would create seismic anisotropy at both poles. This is in contrast to our observation that anisotropy in the inner core does not extend from south pole to north pole. Given this new observation, it is important that future geodynamical models assess whether topographic relaxation mechanisms can produce asymmetric flow around the equator, resulting in stronger anisotropy at the north pole than the south pole.\nHemispherical structures in the inner core are equally complicated to account for, and must further be compatible with the processes to generate anisotropy. Proposed hemispherical models are separated broadly based on whether the density or thermal profile in the inner core is stable. If the inner core has an unstable density or thermal profile, then convection becomes probable (Lythgoe and Deuss, 2015). For specific conditions (large viscosity and low thermal conductivity), this convection will be in the form of inner core translation which can result in a hemispherical pattern (Alboussiere et al. 2010; Deguen et al. 2018). An anisotropic fabric will be able to form if this translation is combined with a texturing mechanism such as topographical relaxation (Yoshida et al. 1996; Deguen et al. 2011), deformation due to magnetic forces (Karato, 1999) or annealing during translation (Bergman et al., 2010). For example, recent work by Frost et al. (2021) has shown that translation in the inner core is able to produce a region in the west with strong anisotropy. However, translation models require a high inner core viscosity (\n>\n\n\n10\n\n\n18\n\n\n Pas), which is not in agreement with current viscosity estimates of \n\n\n10\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n10\n\n\n17\n\n\n (Koot and Dumberry, 2011; Ritterbex and Tsuchiya, 2020).\nAlternatively, variations in crystallisation rate at the inner core boundary could result in hemispherical differences being \u2018frozen in\u2019 as the inner core grows (Aubert et al., 2008). In this case, heat flux at the ICB would be influenced by flow in the outer core, the magnetic field, and potentially thermal anomalies at the core mantle boundary (Karato 1993). This mechanism of hemisphere formation implies that structures at increasing depth within the inner core record older properties of ICB properties, outer core flow, and magnetic field strength. This opens the potential to use seismology to infer paleomagnetic properties, but it is also unclear if anomalies in the outer core could last long enough to maintain a consistent pattern of crystallisation in the inner core, and whether this pattern could truly be preserved for substantial periods of time.\n\n\n8\nConclusion\nOur transdimensional-MCMC model of inner core seismic velocity shows that hemispherical structures and regional-scale variations in anisotropy are required to explain inner core body wave data. The observed features remain when removing anomalous data from earthquakes originating in the South Sandwich Islands, and also when using data corrected for 3D mantle structure. Our results reveal for the first time that the strong anisotropic region in the west is primarily located in the northern hemisphere, with implications for geodynamical models of inner core formation. This result is guided only by the data itself without any prior structure imposed in the parameterisation, and is robust even when considering uncertainties in the data and model space. We propose to call this an anisotropic zone (rather than hemisphere) to better describe its shape. We also find robust evidence for a innermost inner core, in which the slowest velocity is at an angle of \n\n\n55\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n\u00b1\n16\n. The IMIC is offset by 400 km from the centre of the inner core and is contained mainly within the eastern hemisphere. Its distinct anisotropy could indicate a different phase of iron (either bcc or fcc) than the rest of the inner core (hcp), and potentially result from multiple stages of inner core growth, while its offset is compatible with models of slow lateral translation.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nHenry Brett: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Dyke swarms resulting from extensional tectonics have been observed to produce crustal widening on the scale of hundreds of meters to several kilometers across the world: the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus (Moores and Vine, 1971; Varga, 1991), the Siberian platform (Polyansky et al., 2017) and NW Australia (Magee and Jackson, 2020) are well studied examples. Through ridge push, these have also been hypothesised as a contributer to the movement of tectonic plates (Swedan, 2015; Hou, 2012). On smaller scales, dykes supply volcanic eruptions and control lava output from vents and their closing and opening is vital in predicting subsequent lava flow (Kervyn et al., 2009). Investigations of shape evolution have been carried out and compared to field measurements in Rum, Scotland and Helam mine, South Africa (Daniels et al., 2012). These found that observed dyke shapes are narrower at the centre and wider at the tips than those predicted from elastic models. Further study into modelling dyke shape change is therefore important in developing a better understanding of the governing processes behind magma cooling from initial intrusion.\nThe cooling time-frames of emplaced magma varies between orders of months and kiloyears (Pansino et al., 2019), depending predominantly upon size and initial temperature in relation to the country rock (Jaeger, 1968). There are two main regimes by which this cooling occurs, as discussed previously by Bruce and Huppert (1989). The first is meltback, in which the initially formed chilled margins and the surrounding country rock can be melted prior to full crystallisation of the magma. The second is blocking, where the body crystallises upon emplacement and blocks the flow of magma. The extent of these regimes significantly alters the shape change of the dyke during cooling as well as the rate of cooling, and in turn crystal growth at various positions within the dyke (Platten and Watterson, 1969; Henriquez and Martin, 1978). This variation in crystal growth is commonly seen in the presence of chilled margins (Huppert and Sparks, 1989; Healy et al., 2018). Although these regimes have been qualitatively discussed in the above literature, quantitative analysis of the regime prevalence has undergone limited investigation.\nCooling of the body is predominantly controlled by conductive movement of heat within the magma (Delaney, 1986). Within dykes, convective heat transfers are relatively small in contrast to processes in large magma chambers (Worster et al., 1990). Consideration of temperature variations due to conduction in magma has been studied in numerous cases to provide analytic solutions (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959) and in more general cases to yield numerical solutions (Alexiades and Solomon, 1993; Dehghan and Najafi, 2016). Advection can then be studied by considering the effects of magma reinjection or flow, as by Bruce and Huppert (1989).\nThis paper uses a numerical model to investigate temperature variation in a vertically emplaced dyke from an initial intrusion shape. Subsequent shape change and variation in cooling regimes are then evaluated. This is studied in the case of a single intrusion cooling without disturbance and in the case of further magma input through the remaining mobile melt. Numerical modelling of dyke cooling has been repeatedly undertaken (Delaney, 1986; Daniels et al., 2014; Petcovic and Dufek, 2005). These investigate cooling timeframes, dyke size and temperature variation in the surrounding country rock (the final case comparing these predictions to those observed in the Columbia River flood basalts). However, there is little literature investigating the dyke shape change (aspect ratio) during cooling in particular.\nThe theory behind heat loss from the body is detailed in section\n\n2\n before being implemented numerically in the static case (cooling from initial emplacement) in section\n\n3\n. Section\n\n4\n then applies this model to produce results relating to: shape change, regime control factors and effects of periodic magma injection. All results are then discussed in section\n\n5\n before presenting the conclusions in section\n\n6\n.\n\n\n2\nTheoretical framework\n\n2.1\nGeneral heat transfer with latent heat liberation\nHeat loss Q in and surrounding a dyke varies linearly with respect to the temperature T (in degrees Kelvin). Including latent heat of crystallisation L, however, leads to a jump condition across the melting\/crystallising temperature range, between the solidus and liquidus at temperatures \n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n respectively. Density \u03c1 and heat capacity \n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\n are assumed to be constant with temperature, and within different phases. This gives the heat profile\n\n(1)\n\n\nQ\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nT\n,\n\n\nT\n<\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nT\n+\nL\n(\nT\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n)\n\/\n(\n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n)\n,\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n<\nT\n<\n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\nT\n+\nL\n,\n\n\nT\n>\n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When applied to the heat equation, the system is therefore dictated by\n\n(2)\n\n\n(\n1\n+\nZ\n)\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n=\n\u03ba\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\n2\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nZ\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\nL\n\/\n[\n\u03c1\n\n\nc\n\n\np\n\n\n(\n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n)\n]\n,\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\ns\n\n\n<\nT\n<\n\n\nT\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n,\n\n\n\notherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where \u03ba is the material's thermal diffusivity.\nThe thermal conductivity of magma and rock decreases with respect to increasing temperature; the extent of this relationship in certain magmatic rocks is discussed in Vosteen and Schellschmidt (2003). This variation in thermal conductivity can be of the order of a half, between the liquidus and initial country rock temperatures. The major effect of this variation is in the temperature evolution of the immediately surrounding country rock, as detailed by Nabelek et al. (2012) in the study of contact aureoles. Here the consequences of thermal conductivity variation are shown to be most notable in the cases of plutons. Heap et al. (2022) shows porosity and hydration of the surrounding rock to also be a factor affecting the thermal properties. Both of these considerations mainly affect the behaviour in the material surrounding large igneous bodies. Therefore, in this study of magma cooling and dyke shape, the thermal properties previously mentioned are assumed constant.\n\n\n2.2\nApplication to dyke shape\nA vertical dyke can be considered as a liquid intrusion of magma that subsequently cools and crystallises. The country rock surrounding the dyke is assumed to be homogeneous and the initial shape of the dyke is governed purely by elastic laws. This shape can be approximated as the uppermost portion of a vertical penny shaped crack (Lai et al., 2015) such that the geometry is approximately linear one-dimensional (rather than radial one-dimensional). In the case of dykes, their forms are significantly narrower in one dimension than in others (\nFig. 1\n\n). Heat loss is, therefore, predominantly in this direction - orthogonal to the plane of the dyke.\nTaking a horizontal cross-section through the body gives a shape, with a vertical normal, whose perimeter is specified by\n\n(4)\n\nx\n=\n\u03b1\nh\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n where x and y are the horizontal axes of the dyke, h is the dyke half-length and \u03b1 determines the aspect ratio of the liquid intrusion. This prefactor is determined by properties of the country rock including shear and elastic moduli as well as the surrounding hydrostatic pressure, as detailed by Lister and Kerr (1991).\nIt is assumed that the magma is emplaced at a single temperature \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n0\n\n\n in the shape detailed above, into country rock of temperature \n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nc\n\n\n. From this, a modified system to solve is obtained: \n(2)\n becomes the one dimensional heat equation with initial and boundary conditions,\n\n(5)\n\n\n(\n1\n+\nZ\n)\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n=\n\u03ba\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\n2\n\n\nT\n\n\n\u2202\n\n\nx\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6)\n\n\nT\n(\nx\n,\nt\n=\n0\n)\n=\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n|\nx\n|\n<\nw\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nc\n\n\n,\n\n\n|\nx\n|\n>\nw\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nT\n(\nx\n\u2192\n\u221e\n,\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nc\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n where Z is as stated in \n(3)\n and w is the initial half-width of the intrusion, dependent on y, as specified by \n(4)\n. Dyke tip propagation is assumed over from the point at which cooling begins, such that the stress field during cooling is homogeneous (as shown in \nFig. 1\n).\n\n\n2.3\nInclusion of further magma input\nThe previous discussion concerns only the case of heat loss from a static magma, after initial emplacement. Consideration of further magma input is accomplished by treating the body of magma, at any point during cooling, as being composed of mobile and immobile sections. Immobile magma is the partially molten material that is predominantly crystallised (\n\u2265\n50\n%\n partially crystallised) whilst the remaining partial melt is considered mobile (from private communication with Sparks (2021)). The mobile portion of the dyke is then able to vary in temperature in response to an assumed Newtonian flow.\nThe boundary temperature between mobile and immobile melt (mobile melt extent) is set to be at the midpoint between the solidus and liquidus, by assuming linear melting and crystallisation with temperature in the region of partial melt. Modification to the temperature within this central region of mobile melt is applied to represent vertical magma input [heat advection due to motion of magma in the plane is of second order in relation to heat conduction in the plane (Bartlett, 1969)]. This modification is investigated by considering periodic reinjection of magma: this causes immediate temperature change within the extent of mobile magma every time reinjection occurs. This can be seen as the temperature of the material within the mobile melt extent being raised to the liquidus temperature once every period (as specified in each figure below).\n\n\n\n3\nModelling method\n\n3.1\nValidity of numerical model\nThis system of equations is known as a two-phase Stefan problem, with a range of melting\/crystallisation temperatures. Although analytic solutions exist for special cases of this problem - such as in the case of a constant temperature solid and for fixed temperature static boundaries (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959; Tao, 1978) - the system outlined in section\n\n2\n requires a numerical approach for solution (Alexiades and Solomon, 1993). Discretisation of the x-domain allows for the use of a forward-step algorithm to be applied (the forward Euler method). The boundary conditions are enforced by setting the temperature at each end of the x-domain after every timestep. A two dimensional solution can then be found by separately calculating the time evolution following discretised line-sections along the y-axis.\nThe validity of this method is tested by applying it to a simplified temperature distribution model with known analytic solution. The simplified system chosen is that of temperature diffusion from an initial \u201ctop-hat\u201d function \n(6)\n without consideration of latent heat liberation. The model is tested at discretisation levels of 50 and 200 subdivisions in the x-domain, with timesteps sufficiently small to ensure stability. Maximum deviations from the analytic model are 5.9% and 3.2% for the respective discretisation levels. The latter is an acceptably low error and so the method used is valid in later calculations when more than 200 subdivisions are used.\n\n\n3.2\nApplication of numerical model\nThe previously outlined numerical method was applied to the system detailed in section\n\n2.2\n. The position of the solidus and liquidus were chosen to agree with that of basaltic magma and country rock (Daniels et al., 2012). The initial temperature of the intrusion was set to the previously chosen liquidus to consider non-superheated magma (superheated magma is touched upon in section\n\n4.3\n) while the initial country rock temperature was set to agree with the geotherm, with intrusion depths specified in each trial. Material properties and constant dyke parameters assumed in the computation of the following results are listed in \nTable 1\n\n [taken from Daniels et al. (2014)]. The outputs of the model are shown in \nFig. 2\n\n, with specified differences in initial conditions, to demonstrate the resulting behaviour along a single horizontal line-section (one dimensional) through the dyke.\nTo address the differences that would be observed as a result of reduced thermal conductivity (section\n\n2.1\n), the model was also run at lower values of thermal conductivity. This shows the effects that increasing porosity and temperature of country rock would have on the behaviour of the dyke. The thermal properties used in these cases were taken from Robertson and Peck (1974), with a thermal conductivity of \n1.25\n\u00a0W\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n chosen to be appropriate. The associated results for this augmented model are given in the supplementary material.\nThe expected cooling regimes are observed in the testing of this model: blocking in \nFig. 2\n\na as the width of solidus position narrows from initially specified width; and meltback in \nFig. 2\n\nb where the solidus position widens (minimally) before subsequent contraction. Observing these phenomena in the one dimensional solutions allows their application to be considered in section\n\n4\n.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nShape change\nApplication of the two dimensional model described in section\n\n3\n is used to demonstrate the change in shape of a dyke, within the horizontal plane, due to initial emplacement of magma. \nFig. 3\n\n shows the evolution of dyke shape as a temperature colour map, with isotherms of solidus and extent of mobile melt indicated. An initial half width of \n10\n\nm\n (aspect ratio of 0.01) is used to demonstrate the temperature profile evolution in the static magma case.\nThe variation in form of these isotherms is considered by calculating the aspect ratios of the solidus and extent of mobile melt at each time step. The resulting shape evolution is detailed in \nFig. 4\n\n. Initial half-widths of 1\u00a0m and 10\u00a0m are investigated (giving initial aspect ratios of 0.001 and 0.01) along with variation in magma reinjection rate - cases with static magma and reinjection, periods of 0.15\u00a0yrs, 0.2\u00a0yrs, \n3\n\ndays\n and \n2\n\ndays\n as specified in the figure caption, are studied.\n\n\n4.2\nCooling regimes\nCooling regimes of meltback and blocking, as described in section\n\n1\n, are investigated by monitoring dyke width with respect to time. The minimum width at which meltback continues to occur is then plotted with respect to country rock temperature, as a proxy for depth. The outcome is displayed in \nFig. 5\n\n for the case of static magma. The temperature of country rock T and minimum half-width for meltback \n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n are seen to follow an inversely proportional relationship [\n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n93\n\/\n(\nT\n\u2212\n650\n)\n, with constants to two significant figures] as seen from the trendline with an agreement of \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.99\n.\nMagma input is then considered by altering the model as stated in section\n\n2.3\n to observe the effects of the periodicity of magma input. \nFig. 6\n\n shows the relationship between the minimum dyke width at which meltback occurs and the periodicity of magma input prior to analysis in section\n\n5.2\n. These are power law trends (\n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n30\n\n\nP\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n and \n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n32\n\n\nP\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n, with constants to two significant figures) that fit the data with \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n values of 0.999 for the red and blue data sets.\n\n\n4.3\nSuperheated intrusions\nThe previous results are related to intrusions at the liquidus; the mechanism by which the majority of dykes are formed (Daniels et al., 2014). Although rare, superheated magmas can also form intrusions. As referenced in Daniels et al. (2014), basaltic intrusions can reach 1320\u00b0C. These magmas can also result from an impactor leading to melting of rock and subsequent layering of superheated material at temperatures up to 1700\u00b0C (Marsh, 2013). To investigate these cases, initial intrusion temperatures of 1320\u00b0C and 1500\u00b0C were applied to the cases studied in sections\n\n4.1\n and \n4.2\n. The results are shown in Figs.\n\n7\n\n and \n8\n\n. Inversely proportional relationships are seen to produce well fitting trendlines (\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.998\n and 0.996 for the blue and red data sets respectively) as in \nFig. 5\n. For the blue and red curves respectively, these trendlines follow \n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n200\n\/\n(\nT\n\u2212\n590\n)\n and \n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n=\n310\n\/\n(\nT\n\u2212\n400\n)\n, with constants to two significant figures.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nObserved relationships: shape change\n\n\nFig. 3\n shows that the dyke tips completely solidify significantly faster than the main body of the dyke: the temperature at the dyke tips decreases to below the solidus of the order of ten times faster than the centre of the dyke. This supports previous qualitative work (Daniels et al., 2014), which shows near immediate blocking of magma flow and crystallisation at dyke tips followed by slow cooling at dyke centres. This is accompanied by rapid cooling and solidification across the entire perimeter (more so near the minor axis than at the dyke tips), as evidenced by the immediate decreases in the aspect ratios in Figs.\n\n4\n\na and \n4\n\nd. The initial decrease from aspect ratios of 0.01 and 0.001 respectively is observed upon emplacement, showing a rapid narrowing immediately after cooling begins. This is also seen in the cases with further reinjection of magma in \nFig. 4\n. This suggests that cooling of the outermost portion of the dyke is governed primarily by static magma heat diffusion.\nSubsequent shape change is seen to differ between the solidus and MME isotherms. To begin with, both isotherms decrease in aspect ratio in all cases shown in \nFig. 4\n, with the solidus aspect ratio continuing to decrease with time in all but \n4\n\nf. The MME isotherm decreases similarly but at lower aspect ratios. However, the MME shows an increase in aspect ratio prior to the melt becoming immobile [evidenced most in \n4\n\na and \n4\n\nd] at which point the MME has a higher aspect ratio than the solidus. Figs.\n\n4\n\nb, \n4\n\nc and \n4\n\ne show the rapid response in shape change of the MME upon reinjection: an increasing step-like pattern is seen in aspect ratios after injection. The solidus does not respond similarly, but continues to decrease, suggesting the effect of reinjection on shape change is primarily on the MME as opposed to the solidus. The case of significant meltback is demonstrated in \n4\n\nf where both boundaries' aspect ratios begin to increase in response to more frequent magma injection, with the MME responding earlier to the solidus. This response is near linear in both cases but with the aspect ratio of the MME increasing at a greater rate than that of the solidus (\n0.016\n\n\n\u00a0yrs\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n compared to \n0.0083\n\n\n\u00a0yrs\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n in this case). However, this case involves melting of large portions of the country rock which likely have different melting characteristics to the emplaced material.\nThis shows that in cases of blocking, the dyke shape (solidus) narrows as it cools while the MME shape narrows before widening just prior to the partial melt becoming immobile. The MME shape is also seen to be far more responsive to magma reinjection (widening after each injection) than the solidus, which only shows this widening in the cases of significant meltback of the country rock (\nFig. 4\n\nf). With limited reinjection, this also suggests abrupt blocking of the magma flow.\n\n\n5.2\nObserved relationships: cooling regimes\nThe cooling of a static body of magma is shown to be capable of producing minimal meltback of the country rock in \nFig. 2\n\nb. \nFig. 5\n shows this meltback to occur only when the surrounding country rock is at very high temperatures (\n\u2265\n\n\n650\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC\n for the chosen parameters), with a minimum temperature (indicated by a dotted line) below which it does not occur. This results in little meltback for the majority of dykes until the country rock approaches the onset of melting temperature, such as with very deep intrusions.\nConsideration of reinjection produces the relationships seen in \nFig. 6\n. For sufficiently long periods, the magma cools to become immobile before the subsequent reinjection and so cannot give rise to meltback; this is seen in the case of the blue points where periods greater than 0.06 years cannot be studied. The results shown for 300\u00b0C and 400\u00b0C country rock follow similar relationships. This suggests that dykes with half-widths of the order of 100 m or more could sustain meltback of country rock with infrequent magma reinjection based purely on conductive and latent heat diffusion (by extrapolation, this would only require reinjection periods of \n\u223c\n2\n\u00a0yrs\n).\n\n\n5.3\nObserved relationships: superheating\nComparison of the shape change between superheated intrusions and those at the liquidus is seen in \nFig. 7\n (compared to \nFig. 4\n). This shows the solidus isotherm to behave similarly to the non-superheated case; the aspect ratio decreases with time in both cases. The aspect ratio of the MME increases further in the superheated cases than the case in section\n\n5.1\n. The maximum aspect ratios reached (after initial decrease) are 0.0093 and 0.0129 in Figs.\n\n7\n\na and \n7\n\nb respectively in comparison with the non-superheated case of 0.0081. This shows the more superheated the emplaced magma, the more widening of the dyke occurs during cooling.\nThe relationships shown in \nFig. 8\n are the same as those seen in section\n\n5.2\n, aside from the boundary temperature of country rock, below which meltback does not occur. These boundaries are found at \u2265590\u00b0C and \u2265400\u00b0C for the blue and red data sets respectively (parameters specified in the figure caption). The deviation from the trendline of the final three red data points likely occurs as \n\n\nw\n\n\nm\ni\nn\n\n\n tends to zero as temperatures approach the solidus temperature. From this it can be seen that as intrusion superheating temperature increases, the position of this boundary decreases while maintaining the same relationship between country rock temperature and minimum half-width at which meltback occurs.\n\n\n5.4\nErrors and possible improvements\nThe main area for improvement upon this model would be to consider continuous flow, vertically through the dyke. This would occur only through the mobile melt portion of the dyke and so the information found on how the MME shape changes can be applied. The reinjection model used is also a discontinuous form of this flow and so gives rise to similar results as those found in section\n\n4\n. Times taken for total crystallisation found with the model used are of the order of months and years (reaching the order of 10\u00a0yrs for a dyke of half-width 10 m and reinjection periods near 0.115\u00a0yrs) as opposed to the maximum kiloyears estimated in Pansino et al. (2019), likely due to this lack of flow.\nDensity variation of the magma with temperature is another possible area of improvement. The density of magma increases as it cools; this is of the order of \n10\nk\ng\n\n\nm\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n per 100\u00b0C of cooling (Lesher and Spera, 2015). This volume change gives rise to additional stresses during cooling, which could alter the dyke shape. The effect of this change is less significant than those due to heat loss and so would likely still follow similar trends to those found here.\nAnother assumption that could have led to errors is that of the constant thermal properties of the magma and surrounding rock. As considered in section\n\n2.1\n, the effects of this consideration are shown to be most prevalent in the country rock immediately surrounding the magma, particularly in the case of larger igneous bodies (Nabelek et al., 2012). In this study primarily concerning the cooling of magma (as opposed to the temperature profile in the surrounding rock), the associated errors are deemed to have little effect on dyke shape and temperature within the melt. This is seen in the supplementary material, where the dyke shape-change is seen to take the same form as in the case with lower thermal conductivity. These models run at a lower thermal conductivity are also good indicators of the behaviour of magma surrounded by a country rock with increased porosity and at a higher temperature.\nThe assumption of the dyke's small aspect ratio is suitable here because the dyke dimensions are consistently such that the length is much greater than the width. However, in order to apply this model to larger, non-planar igneous bodies (batholiths and magma chambers for example), two and three dimensional heat diffusion models would need to be considered. In addition, convection is not investigated here [due to its second order effects in dykes (Delaney, 1986)] but is integral in the cooling mechanisms of larger bodies (Worster et al., 1990).\n\n\n5.5\nComparison to geological examples\nThe narrowing of dykes during cooling discussed in section\n\n5.1\n suggests that dykes have thinner centres and wider tips than expected based upon initial intrusion shape. This is seen in the field where dykes are often seen to have wider tips than expected. This has been observed in the Isle of Rum, Scotland and Helam mine, South Africa by Daniels et al. (2012) and in the Jagged Rocks Complex, USA by Re et al. (2015). This is commonly attributed to interaction between dyke tips and changes in composition of the country rock. The narrowing modelled here is purely the result of the magma cooling process and so suggests that both components are important in developing this dyke shape. This also indicates that modelling dyke tip interactions and varying country rock material would be appropriate areas to build upon this study.\nRapid cooling around the dyke perimeter is shown to occur in section\n\n5.1\n, giving rise to limited crystal development. This is particularly evident in the cases of narrow dykes with limited flow (\nFig. 4\n\nd). These chilled margins are commonly seen in the field, giving rise to significantly different igneous textures at dyke margins compared to their centres (Healy et al., 2018).\nThe meltback regimes observed in Figs.\n\n2\n\nb and \n4\n\nf suggest alteration of the country rock surrounding dykes upon emplacement. This is especially prevalent in the cases with magma reinjection. Similar partial melting of the rock and alteration via contact metamorphism is seen around large dykes in the Greenland and Canada (Denyszyn et al., 2004).\nRepetitive magma reinjection along the same dykes is a common method of recharge for certain volcanoes - a well studied example of which is the Krafla fissure zone in Iceland (Marquart and Jacoby, 1985). The reinjection model used here can then be applied to the evolution of dyke shapes for these such volcanoes.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nThe current investigation shows that during the cooling of magma from initial emplacement, the horizontal cross-section shape of a dyke varies from its initial form by narrowing. In all blocking regimes, the solidus isotherm narrows continuously up until crystallisation, whereas the mobile melt extent (MME) isotherm first narrows before widening, prior to the melt becoming immobile. Meltback regimes show the form of both the solidus and MME to widen (aspect ratio increasing linearly with time) but with the MME being more responsive to subsequent magma reinjection and leading the solidus shape change in time.\nIn addition to this, the regimes of blocking and meltback are seen to be heavily reliant on the rate of magma input. In the static magma case, meltback is very rare, occurring only in cases where the country rock is at very high temperatures (within 300\u00b0C of the solidus) and gives rise to minimal partial melting of surrounding rock. With reinjection of magma, meltback can occur at far lower temperatures of country rock and give rise to significant partial melting. The period of reinjection and minimum dyke width for meltback are shown to follow a near linear relationship for periods of reinjection greater than 0.03 yrs.\nSuperheated intrusions are briefly considered and shown to increase the incidence of meltback when compared to magma emplaced at the liquidus temperature. As well as this, the greater the extent of superheating, the greater the increased widening of the MME isotherm shape during cooling, while having little to no effect on the evolution of the form of the solidus isotherm.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nMarco Loncar: Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Our planetary vehicle lacks a fuel gauge to define the amount of fuel left to power plate tectonics, mantle convection, and the geodynamo. Defining the thermal evolution of the planet gives insights into the cooling and crystallization history of the core, the temporal variation in mantle viscosity, and the nature of the cosmic building blocks of the Earth. With the dawn of geoneutrino detection (Araki et al., 2005), we now have the opportunity to define the Earth's radiogenic fuel budget, which in turn can specify the proportional contribution of these heat producing elements (K, Th, U) in the crust and mantle.\nTwenty years have passed since particle physicists began detecting the Earth's emission of geoneutrinos (chargeless and near-massless particles emitted during \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n decay) (Araki et al., 2005). The first generation of detectors (KamLAND in Japan and Borexino in Italy) have reported their flux measurements and interpreted their data in the context of an assumed geological model. The precision of the flux measurement (\u03c3) continues to improve with exposure time, as it follow counting statistics (\n\u03c3\n\u223c\n1\n\/\n\n\nN\n\n\n, N=number of observed events). The accuracy of the interpretation and its uncertainties depends on the assumed geological model. To interpret the geoneutrino flux measurement, one uses a detailed assessment of the Th and U abundances and distribution in the lithosphere surrounding the detector (closest \u223c500 km, which typically contributes 40 to 50% of the measured signal). A reference model is assumed for contributions from the remaining global lithosphere and mantle, with the Earth's core having negligible quantities of K, Th, and U, and no significant contribution to the signal. Combined analyses of the results from the KamLAND and Borexino experiments favor an Earth with \u223c20 TW present-day total radiogenic power (or a \u223c16 TW Earth for just Th and U power) (McDonough et al., 2020; Bellini et al., 2021). This finding indicates that \u223c40% of the Earth's estimated power of 46 \u00b1 3 TW (Jaupart et al., 2015) comes from radiogenic sources.\nControversy remains, however, regarding the assumed geological model used to describe the local lithospheric contribution to the geoneutrino flux. For the lithosphere surrounding the KamLAND detector the various geological models predicting the local 3D distribution of Th and U differ by a factor of 1.4, based on their reported geoneutrino fluxes (Enomoto, 2006; Huang et al., 2013; Wipperfurth et al., 2020). In contrast, for the Borexino detector the various predictions differ by a factor of 3 (Coltorti et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Agostini et al., 2020; Wipperfurth et al., 2020). The interpretation of the regional geology is important for geoneutrino studies as it fundamentally influences the final result, and the global abundances of Th and U.\nThe latest interpretation of geoneutrino data from the Borexino experiment (Agostini et al., 2020) predicts a low contribution from their local crust to the overall geoneutrino signal. Consequently, their inferred mantle geoneutrino signal is high (\u223c25 TW from Th+U), as well as their calculation for the bulk Earth's radiogenic power (\u223c38 TW from K+Th+U), with model uncertainties at \u223c34% (Agostini et al., 2020). This prediction contrasts with other geoneutrino experiments (Gando et al., 2013; Agostini et al., 2015) and numerous geochemical (McDonough and Sun, 1995; Javoy et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013, e.g.) and geophysical (Turcotte and Schubert, 2014; Jaupart et al., 2016, e.g.) models for Earth. Agostini et al. (2020) places their upper limit of uncertainty at 51 TW of radiogenic heat production, which is outside of all geological observations.\nHere we review the data for constructing a local geological model for the lithosphere immediately surrounding the Borexino detector. We evaluate the local geological model used in Agostini et al. (2020) and compare it with competing models. We then test whether such models are consistent with the known regional geology and heat flux constraints. Using these findings, we identify the best local lithospheric models for the Borexino experiment. Relying on the same principles, we discuss the competing local lithospheric models for the next generation of geoneutrino experiments.\n\n\n2\nBackground\nNeutrinos are weakly-interacting fundamental particles that stream freely through matter, carrying information about their decay source. Detection of electron antineutrinos (\n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n) is accomplished via the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) reaction with a free proton (p): \n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n+\np\n\u2192\n\n\ne\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\nn\n [n, neutron; \n\n\ne\n\n\n+\n\n\n, positron] with an energy threshold of \n\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\nt\nh\nr\n\n\n=\n1.8\n MeV. This restriction allows detection of only the highest energy antineutrinos produced during some of the \n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n decays in the 238U and 232Th decay chains (Araki et al., 2005).\nEarth's total geoneutrino emission comes from the lithosphere and mantle, with the number of \n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n observed (i.e., S, signal) by physicists is therefore:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n=\n\n\nS\n\n\nl\ni\nt\nh\no\ns\np\nh\ne\nr\ne\n\n\n+\n\n\nS\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n is reported in Terrestrial Neutrino Units (TNU) to normalize between detectors of different sizes; 1 TNU equals 1 antineutrino detection per 1 kiloton of scintillation fluid (1032 free protons) per year of exposure in a 100% efficient detector. \n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n is proportional to the concentration of U times its sensitivity factor (\u03b1), and the same for Th, divided by the square of their distance (r) from the detector:\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n\u221d\n\n\n\u03b1\n[\nU\n]\n+\n\u03b2\n[\nT\nh\n]\n\n\n\n\nr\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sensitivity factors account for a neutrino's interaction cross-section, which scales with its discrete energy, and accounts for the higher energy neutrino from U being more detectable than those from Th, despite 4\u00d7 lower concentration levels of the former.\n\nFig. 1\n shows the sensitivity of \n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n relative to distance from the detector in central Italy. At a known decay rate, a relatively constant (232Th\/238U)\n\n\n\nm\no\nl\na\nr\n\n\n value (Wipperfurth et al., 2018), and an assumed K\/U value, we calculate the abundance of the heat producing elements (K, Th, and U; HPEs). Please refer to Supplementary equation S1-Eq1 for the full calculation of the total \n\n\n\n\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n signal.\nCompositional variations in the local lithosphere have the strongest effect on the geoneutrino signal because the lithosphere is closer to the detector (smaller r) and is 100-fold enriched in HPE relative to the mantle. Although the Earth's mantle is largest silicate reservoir, its low U concentration (\u226410 ng\/g) and distance (greater r) causes its signal to be muted.\nTo determine the contribution of geoneutrinos from the mantle, and therefore how much radioactive heat is left to power mantle convection, plate tectonics, or the geodynamo, we must first determine the U and Th concentrations in the lithosphere surrounding the detector. Subtracting the lithospheric signal from the total signal is done to establish the mantle value and its Th and U content. The \n\n\nS\n\n\nl\ni\nt\nh\no\ns\np\nh\ne\nr\ne\n\n\n has Near-Field Lithospheric (NFL) and Far-Field Lithospheric (FFL) contributions. Thus, the mantle geoneutrino signal is:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n=\n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n\nS\n\n\nN\nF\nL\n\n\n+\n\n\nS\n\n\nF\nF\nL\n\n\n)\n\n\n The relative contributions of these components are: Near-Field lithosphere (40 to 50%), Far-Field lithosphere (30 to 40%, i.e., global lithospheric signal), and mantle (\u226425%) (Wipperfurth et al., 2020). The lithosphere includes the mechanically coupled, underlying lithospheric mantle, which has limited compositional variation (McDonough, 1990) and contributes little (order \u223c1 TNU, <10% of the signal) to the lithospheric signals (Huang et al., 2013). Araki et al. (2005) observed that the first 50 km and 500 km from KamLAND contribute \u223c25% and \u223c50%, respectively, of the total signal.\n\nModeling uncertainties: The relative uncertainties on the flux measurement at KamLAND and Borexino experiments improve over time; KamLAND went from \u223c54% to \u223c15% uncertainty for its measured flux, while Borexino went from \u223c42% to \u223c19%. The modern mantle with depleted and enrich domains is predicted to show only \u223c10% total variation in its geoneutrino signal (\u0160r\u00e1mek et al., 2013). Likewise, only \u223c10% relative variation is observed in estimates of the Far-Field lithospheric signal. Typically, the upper crust (i.e., the top 1\/3 of the crust) contributes \u223c70% of the geoneutrino signal from the lithosphere. Hence, the greatest impact on interpreting the mantle signal comes from accurately predicting the upper crustal composition, that is, the \n\n\nS\n\n\nN\nF\nL\n\n\n.\n\n\n3\nLithospheric modeling\nDisentangling the mantle's contribution to \n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n is a major goal of geoneutrino studies. Doing so requires accurate models for \n\n\nS\n\n\nL\ni\nt\nh\no\ns\np\nh\ne\nr\ne\n\n\n. Importantly, uncertainties (statistical and systematic) in the NFL model contribute most significantly to uncertainties in the modern mantle and global results.\nGiven the limited (\u00b110%) variation in the mantle's signal, one expects its predicted values from different geoneutrino experiments to agree at this level. However, the local estimates of the modern mantle \n\n\nS\n\n\nm\na\nn\nt\nl\ne\n\n\n range from \n\u223c\n30\n\u00b1\n13\n TNU (power from K, Th, and U) by the Borexino team (Agostini et al., 2020) to \n\u223c\n7\n\u00b1\n1.6\n TNU by the KamLAND team (Gando et al., 2013). Consequently, the disparate nature of these findings either means (1) the mantle is grossly heterogeneous (i.e., beyond scales envisaged by geology), or (2) there are substantial inaccuracies in lithospheric modeling.\nThe distribution, volume, composition (HPE content), and petrology of the formations surrounding a detector must be accurately determined for its contribution to \n\n\nS\n\n\nN\nF\nL\n\n\n. Shales and granites are enriched in HPEs, whereas peridotites and carbonates normally are not. However, the degree of HPE enrichment is variable even within a given rock type. HPE concentrations differ among igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, and between silicate and carbonate lithologies (Fig. 2\n). It is therefore crucial to model accurately the proportional contribution of each geological formation and its HPE content near a detector.\nThe Borexino geoneutrino experiment at Gran Sasso National Laboratory was located outside of L'Aquila, Italy, in the central Italian peninsula (Fig. 3\n, 13.57\u00b0E, 42.45\u00b0N, with 1.4 km of rock overburden). The Apennines consist primarily of foreland basin sediments and siliciclastic foredeep basin sediments, covered by Middle Pleistocene to Recent volcanics (on the western side) and continental shelf and marine deposits (Cosentino et al., 2010; Vignaroli et al., 2019). The marine deposits are mainly dolomitic (marble, where metamorphosed). Extensional forces from mantle spreading to the west of the Apennines have led to a fault-block system of grabens filled with terreginous sediments in a region known as the Tyrrhenian Extensional Zone (Cosentino et al., 2010). As a result, the uppermost crust near the detector could contain a mixture of lithologies ranging from <1 ppm to >4 ppm U (Fig. 2).\n\n3.1\nNear-field and far-field lithosphere\nThe Near-Field Lithosphere (NFL) is oftentimes, for the sake of computational ease, treated as the 4\u00b0latitude \u00d7 6\u00b0longitude area centered on the detector (Huang et al., 2013), rather than a circle with a 500 km diameter. The Far-Field Lithosphere (FFL) consists of the rest of the Earth's lithosphere (oceanic and continental). The crucial step, which requires geoscientific expertise, is determining the concentration and distribution of HPEs in the lithologies of the Near-Field Lithosphere.\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\nF\nF\nL\n\n\n is a global average of the continental and oceanic lithospheric contribution to a detector's farfield geoneutrino flux. Model predictions for the \n\n\nS\n\n\nF\nF\nL\n\n\n at existing and future planned detector sites are consistent, with estimates agreeing at better than the \u00b120% level. The competing predictions for \n\n\nS\n\n\nF\nF\nL\n\n\n\n\n\nB\no\nr\ne\nx\ni\nn\no\n\n\n agree at \n16\n\u00b1\n1\n TNU (Coltorti et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Agostini et al., 2020; Wipperfurth et al., 2020).\nWhether a signal is from a moderate source of heat producing elements in the lithosphere near the detector or from a more concentrated mantle source is where discrepancies are introduced. To illustrate this point, and to highlight the need for accurate lithospheric models for the area surrounding geoneutrino detectors, we walk through the impacts of two different scenarios of upper crustal concentrations for Th and U near the Borexino geoneutrino detector.\n\nFig. 4\n illustrates the signal trade-off between HPE content of the Near-Field Lithosphere and mantle. \n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n depends on the total mass of HPEs and their distance from the detector. The non-uniqueness of the modeling drives us to construct more accurate 3D descriptions of the HPE contents of the Near-Field Lithosphere, to evaluate better the mantle HPE concentrations.\n\n\n3.2\nNumerical model\n\nFig. 5\n presents two NFL models used to analyze the effects of vastly different abundances of Th and U in the upper crust surrounding the Borexino detector: (1) a low Th+U content (e.g., dominantly carbonate) and (2) medium Th+U content (e.g., shale-like, or averaged carbonate + siliciclastics + volcanic). These idealized models are comparable to those reported in (1) Agostini et al. (2020) and Coltorti et al. (2011), and (2) Huang et al. (2013), Wipperfurth et al. (2020), and McDonough et al. (2020).\nUsing Monte Carlo numerical modeling (Wipperfurth et al., 2020), we determined the expected \n\n\nS\n\n\nN\nF\nL\n\n\n\n\n\nB\no\nr\ne\nx\ni\nn\no\n\n\n assuming two different scenarios: low and medium HPE contents for the upper crust. The HPE content of the middle, and lower crust and lithospheric mantle are taken from Sammon and McDonough (2021); Sammon et al. (2022). For the physical description of the local lithosphere, we use the LITHO1.0 model (Pasyanos et al., 2014) (i.e. density, distance from detector) with 1\u00b0latitude x 1\u00b0longitude horizontal resolution for the upper, middle, and lower crust and lithospheric mantle. Table 1\n lists the compositional model parameters for the NFL, its signal, and that for the total lithosphere and mantle. This table also reveals the predicted power of the mantle and bulk Earth for these two different upper crustal models and thus NFL models.\nA factor of three difference in the HPE budget of the upper crust for these two NFL models produces a factor of \u223c2 difference in both the estimated mantle and bulk Earth radiogenic power (Fig. 6\n). These gross differences in the predicted radiogenic power demonstrate the significance of producing an accurate NFL model.\n\n\n\n4\nImportance of the near-field lithosphere model\nThe Apennines of the central Italian peninsula expose a geological paradox across its eastern and western divide. Its Adriatic eastern side is composed of a compressional fold and thrust belt, whereas its Tyrrhenian western side is composed of extensional fault-block mountains. The paradox of this mountain belt is the juxtaposition of both compressional and extensional tectonic forces over a relatively narrowed (\u223c150 km) east-west traverse.\n\nFig. 7\n shows that carbonate sediments surround the Borexino detector, whereas the western half of the Near-Field region exposes extensive deposits of Neogene to Quaternary igneous rocks (Lima et al., 2005; Xhixha et al., 2014). The Tuscan and Roman magmatic provinces are exposed all throughout the Tyrrhenian side of the Apennines and coastal plains. This western portion of the Italian peninsula is enriched in K, Th, and U, with some rocks containing as much as 25 \u03bcg\/g U (Conticelli et al., 2007), which is slightly less than 10 times enriched over average upper crustal rocks (Rudnick and Gao, 2014).\nThese western Tuscan and Roman magmatic rocks are HPE-enriched and make up a significant portion of the upper crust of the NFL. Some of these rocks are within 50 km of the Borexino detector and need to be incorporated into any NFL model, but unfortunately these lithologies were not discussed by Coltorti et al. (2011); Agostini et al. (2020). Agostini et al. (2020) highlighted the central tile, which includes the area within \u223c100 km of the Borexino detector and noted \u201cUp to a distance of \u223c150 km from Borexino, 100% of the geoneutrino signal is generated from the LOC [local lithosphere].\u201d Nearly all of the volcanoes identified in Fig. 7, some of which are enormous volcanic centers, are within 150 km of the Borexino detector. In addition, the CROP 11 seismic refraction line that the Agostini et al. model cites as evidence for 13 km of carbonate sediments shows thick layers of siliciclastic sediments as well (e.g., Patacca et al. (2008); Di Luzio et al. (2009)).\nTo develop our alternative model of the \n\n\n\nB\no\nr\ne\nx\ni\nn\no\n\n\nNFL, we followed the practices of Huang et al. (2013) and McDonough et al. (2020) and used a generic, average upper crust composition (Rudnick and Gao, 2014). Using such a generic model for the upper crust of the NFL results in a mantle and bulk Earth model that is consistent with studies that favor a 20 TW radiogenic Earth (McDonough et al., 2020; Bellini et al., 2021).\nDisparities between the predicted HPE concentrations in the upper crust for the NFL cause the greatest systematic uncertainties in calculated radiogenic heat production. Constructing a purely carbonate versus a generic upper crust around the detector changes the expected mantle radiogenic heat budget from 30 TW to 13 TW, respectively. These contrasting models illustrate the consequences of modeling different proportions of HPE lithologies for the NFL. Consequently, inaccurate estimates of the subsurface composition near a detector vastly change the implications of the observed geoneutrino signal \n\n\nS\n\n\nt\no\nt\na\nl\n\n\n.\n\n\n5\nHeat flux constraints on lithospheric models\nTo further assess the upper crustal model of the \n\n\n\nB\no\nr\ne\nx\ni\nn\no\n\n\nNFL we turned to the available heat flux data for the central Apennines (Pauselli et al., 2019; Verdoya et al., 2021). Given the regional tectonic setting discussed above, it is not surprising to observe a clear distinction between the western, high heat flux (>150 mW\/m2) and the eastern low heat flux (<70 mW\/m2) provinces (Pauselli et al., 2019) (Fig. 7). Moreover, using observable crustal radiogenic heat production data, Verdoya et al. (2021) concluded that low surface heat flux estimates (e.g., values <45 mW\/m2) are unreliable in the Apennines. This study also concluded that the central Apennines region has an average heat flux of \u223c70 mW\/m2 (with eastern and western limbs being approximately 55 and 150 mW\/m2, respectively). On average, the \n\n\n\nB\no\nr\ne\nx\ni\nn\no\n\n\nNFL has a relatively normal continental surface heat flux value (e.g., \u223c63 mW\/m2, (Lucazeau, 2019)).\nSurface heat flux is the sum of contributions from heat production in the crust and the heat flux across the Moho. The total surface heat flux (Total\n\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n) can be expressed as the sum of crustal and Moho heat fluxes:\n\n(4)\n\nT\no\nt\na\n\n\nl\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n\u2261\nC\nr\nu\ns\n\n\nt\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n+\nM\no\nh\n\n\no\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, a regionally averaged surface heat flux (e.g., \u223c63 mW\/m2) is dominated by an upper crustal fraction (i.e., 50 to 60%) and, less so, by a \n\u223c\n1\n\/\n3\n contribution from the Moho heat flux (i.e., 21 \u00b1 10 mW\/m2) (Sammon et al., 2022). If we assume a generic crustal compositional model (Table 1), the regional Total\n\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n for the Italian peninsula appears normal in terms of its heat production and surface heat flux (i.e., \u223c70 mW\/m2). In contrast, assuming the compositional model for the NFL adopted by Agostini'20 (Coltorti et al., 2011) puts the Crust\n\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n contribution at 24 mW\/m2 and a Moho\n\n\n\nH\nF\n\n\n of 46 mW\/m2 \u2013 more than double the global average. While this level of Moho heat flux is possible, it is only observed in areas of recent volcanism, which contradicts the low HPE carbonate shelf model.\nThe Earth emits 46 \u00b1 3 TW of heat (Jaupart et al., 2016), which is both radiogenic and primordial in origin. The Agostini et al. (2020) model has 8.1 TW of radiogenic heat from the global lithosphere and 30 TW of radiogenic heat from the mantle, leaving the remaining \u223c8 TW being primordial energy left in the Earth. Assuming there is a flux of heat across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), with current estimates between 9 and 16 TW (i.e., 60-100 mW\/m2), then Agostini et al.'s (2020) model has no remaining primordial energy left in the mantle. Our alternative model of radiogenic heat in the Earth has 7.6\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1.6\n\n\n+\n2.1\n\n\n TW in the global lithosphere (Wipperfurth et al., 2020) and 12.9 TW in the mantle, which together represent about 45% of the total heat flux from the Earth. The remaining 25 TW (or 55%) of the Earth's heat flux comes from primordial sources. If this latter heat flux is shared sub-equally between the core and mantle, then our model yields a CMB heat flux that is consistent with current estimates (Labrosse et al., 2001; Labrosse, 2002; Roberts et al., 2003; Korenaga, 2008; Nakagawa and Tackley, 2010; Olson, 2016).\nThe first experiment to detect geoneutrinos, KamLAND, in Kamioka, Japan, predicts a low radiogenic power Earth, 11.2\n\n\n\n\u2212\n5.1\n\n\n+\n7.9\n\n\n TW for Th and U only, or 14 TW when including the decay of other isotopes (Gando et al., 2013). This result is intermediate between the low H (H = heat production) estimates for the Earth (Javoy et al., 2010) and middle H estimates (McDonough and Sun, 1995; Palme and O'Neill, 2014). The NFL model used by the KamLAND team (Enomoto et al., 2007) predicts an Earth with a low radiogenic power, whereas that proposed by Wipperfurth et al. (2020) predicts an Earth with 20 TW of total radiogenic power.\nThese KamLAND results challenge the Earth model of Agostini et al. (2020) that predicts 38 TW of radiogenic power. Either (1) the geological compositions of the KamLAND and\/or the Borexino models need to be thoroughly re-investigated, or (2) one would have to predict a hemispherical dichotomy in the mantle's composition. The latter hypothesis is, of course, unsupported by empirical data on the composition of mid-ocean ridge basalts and ocean island basalts. The second hypothesis seems completely untenable.\nIn summary, we document the significance of geology's input into interpreting the particle physics flux data. The combined results for KamLAND and Borexino experiments strongly favor a 20 TW radiogenic Earth model. Moreover, these results confirm that the bulk Earth has a 1.9\u00d7 enrichment in refractory elements over a CI chondritic composition (Yoshizaki and McDonough, 2021).\n\n\n6\nThe future of neutrino geoscience\nHigh resolution crustal models accounting for the specific types and proportions of lithologies surrounding each geoneutrino detector must be constructed to interpret geoneutrino flux measurement. The geology underlying active geoneutrino detectors (Fig. 8\n) in Gran Sasso, Italy, Kamioka, Japan, and Sudbury, Canada, reveal complicated tectonic features (e.g., (paleo-)subduction and synorogenic extension, ocean-continent subduction zone, large impact structure). Geoneutrino data already exists from two of these locations, but these crustal models are either low resolution or in conflict with one another. We must reconcile the geoneutrino signal at each location with improved local and regional geology. We must use a wide range of independent geoscientific data to constrain the composition of the NFL. Moreover, our compositional models needs to be internally consistent with available heat flow, geochemistry\/petrology, structural geology, and seismology data to reduce the systematic uncertainties on Earth's HPE content and thermal budget.\nThere are three more geoneutrino projects under construction or development: Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO, Fig. 8 purple dot) in southeastern China, which will be 20x larger than any existing detector (An et al., 2016); China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL, Fig. 8 green dot) sited on the eastern slope of the Tibetan plateau and Himalayan ramp and at 2.4 km depth (Beacom et al., 2017); and OBD, a movable, Ocean Bottom Detector (Fig. 8 teal dot) proposed by a team of scientists and engineers working with JAMSTEC (Sakai et al., 2022). These projects each represent massive feats of engineering and decades-long data collection experiments and require substantial geoscientific input.\nThe decay of HPEs contributes substantially to Earth's internal heat. By quantifying Earth's geoneutrino flux, we can precisely establish how much fuel from HPEs is left to power mantle convection and the recycling processes of plate tectonics. Geoneutrinos studies use modern physics technology to measure directly and instantaneously the current compositional properties of the inaccessible mantle. Th and U exist in Earth in constant, chondritic ratios to 26 other elements (McDonough and Sun, 1995); if we constrain the abundance of HPEs, we can establish Earth's concentrations of Ca, Al, Nb, and the economically valuable rare earth elements. With the second generation of geoneutrino detectors on the horizon, geoscientists and physicists are poised to unravel Earth's heat budget from the tallest mountains to the bottom of the oceans.\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nThe power of geoneutrino studies lies in directly quantifying the amount of heat producing elements in the bulk Earth. Deep reservoirs in Earth that before were unreachable are being sampled by particle physicists, but these studies have not reached a consensus on what their results mean for mantle heat production. The geoneutrino signal at a given detector is a combination of crust-sourced and mantle-sourced Th and U decays. Since geoneutrinos do not carry directional information, the lithospheric signal must be constrained to quantify the mantle's abundances of Th and U.\nApproximately 50% of the geoneutrino signal is produced from the Near-Field Lithosphere (NFL), with 25% of the signal coming from the HPEs within 50 km of the detector. Conflicting Near-Field Lithospheric compositional models lead to profoundly different consequences for the predicted HPE content in the mantle and Earth's thermal evolution.\nThe Borexino particle physics team (Agostini et al., 2020) modeled the NFL surrounding their detector as predominantly carbonate, with low concentrations of Th and U. Their model therefore requires most of the geoneutrino signal to come from the distant mantle, implying a 30 TW of mantle radiogenic heat production. Consequently, >80% of all of the Earth's internal heat is radiogenic. This high heat production mantle is inconsistent with measurements from the detector at KamLAND and with heat flux observations.\nAlternatively, the inclusion of Neogene to Recent, HPE-rich volcanic deposits in the Borexino NFL region results in a more normal average upper crustal composition for Th and U. Using this upper crustal model (versus a low HPE model) can explain the Borexino signal, resulting in 13 TW of radiogenic power in the mantle or a 20 TW radiogenic Earth. It is therefore imperative to produce high-resolution NFL maps with accurate proportions of each HPE lithology.\nThe direct measurement of geoneutrinos can provide crucial insights into the sources and distribution of heat producing elements in the Earth. When paired with accurate geological knowledge, these high-energy antineutrinos emitted from HPE decays within Earth help establish the composition of the planet's building blocks as well as the fuel left to power Earth's dynamic interior.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nLGS and WFM contributed to the conceptualization of this project.

Understanding the evolution of volatile elements on terrestrial planets is therefore required to investigate habitability in exoplanetary systems (Kaltenegger, 2017).\nThe noble gas compositions of Earth's mantle sources record the sources of volatiles as well as evolutionary processes such as recycling through subduction and degassing (e.g., Marty, 2012; Moreira, 2013; Mukhopadhyay and Parai, 2019). However, mantle-derived samples, such as basaltic glass, often show a pervasive atmospheric contamination (Ballentine and Barfod, 2000; Mukhopadhyay and Parai, 2019), which prevents precisely determining the mantle noble gas composition. As such, little is known about the deep mantle heavy noble gases krypton and xenon, which are particularly powerful tracers in elucidating accretion and loss of volatiles to the Earth, along with Earth's early degassing history (Broadley et al., 2020a; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Parai et al., 2019; P\u00e9ron et al., 2021).\nThe Earth's atmosphere shows a xenon depletion relative to chondrites, with the Xe\/Kr ratio being about one order of magnitude lower than chondrites (Bekaert et al., 2020; Dauphas, 2003; Halliday, 2013; Marty, 2012; Pepin, 1991; Pepin and Porcelli, 2002). This missing Xe was initially assigned to Xe loss from the atmosphere via hydrodynamic escape early in Earth's history (Pepin, 1991; Pepin and Porcelli, 2002). But, atmospheric Xe was later observed to have been lost progressively from the Archean to 2.4 Ga ago (Almayrac et al., 2021; Ardoin et al., 2022; Avice et al., 2018; Pujol et al., 2011). Some studies have overcome the issue of shallow atmospheric contamination of mantle-derived samples and show a Xe depletion relative to chondrites in the mantle as well (e.g., Moreira et al., 1998; Mukhopadhyay and Parai, 2019; Trieloff and Kunz, 2005). However, about 90% of the deep mantle Xe was shown to be recycled atmospheric Xe (Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Parai and Mukhopadhyay, 2015; Pet\u0151 et al., 2013), although the fractions of mantle Ar and Kr from recycling are not precisely known. Therefore, it is unclear whether the mantle xenon depletion was present in the early Earth, what its magnitude might have been, or whether the signature was acquired through recycling of the Xe depleted atmosphere.\nTo overcome the atmospheric contamination issue, we used a recently developed gas accumulation protocol to precisely measure krypton and xenon isotopes in basaltic glass samples from the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). The Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots show among the most primitive 3He\/4He and 20Ne\/22Ne ratios on Earth along with negative tungsten anomalies that reflects mantle heterogeneities created in the first 60 Myr of solar system formation (Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Mundl-Petermeier et al., 2020; P\u00e9ron et al., 2016). Hence, both hotspots are ideal locations to investigate volatile evolution in the early Earth.\nHere, we present a new approach to determine the initial noble gas elemental ratios of mantle sources. Atmospheric heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) are recycled into the mantle at subduction zones through sediments and altered oceanic crust (Chavrit et al., 2016; Holland and Ballentine, 2006; Kendrick et al., 2013; Matsumoto et al., 2001; Parai and Mukhopadhyay, 2015). Consequently, the present-day elemental noble gas compositions are a mixture of initial and recycled atmospheric noble gases. In this study, using the precise Kr and Xe isotopic measurements from Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021), we corrected the measured (present-day) elemental ratios for recycling to obtain the pre-subduction deep mantle elemental noble gas composition. Crucially, this new approach shows that the deep mantle was initially depleted in Xe relative to chondrites and the magnitude of the depletion was larger than in the modern-day atmosphere. Possible scenarios to account for this depletion are discussed.\n\n\n2\nMethods\nThe samples and noble gas analyses are described in details in P\u00e9ron et al. (2021). For the purpose of this article, they are briefly summarized below.\n\n2.1\nSamples\nTo determine the deep mantle noble gas elemental pattern, we used basaltic glass samples from Fernandina, Gal\u00e1pagos and from Midfell, Iceland. These two hotspots present high 3He\/4He ratios (>15 Ra, with Ra the atmospheric 3He\/4He isotopic ratio) and the most primitive neon isotopic ratios, with 20Ne\/22Ne > 12.8 for both hotspots (Kurz et al., 2009; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; P\u00e9ron et al., 2021; Trieloff et al., 2000). Hence, their noble gas compositions are supposed to reflect that of a nearly undegassed, more primordial deep mantle reservoir (Kurz et al., 2009; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Trieloff et al., 2000).\nSamples AHA-NEMO2-D22A and AHA-NEMO2-D22B (hereafter D22A and D22B respectively, and D22 to include all samples) were collected from a submarine lava flow of Fernandina volcano (Geist et al., 2006; Kurz et al., 2009). Both samples show 4He\/40Ar* ratios (40Ar* being radiogenic 40Ar) between 3.6-4.0 (Table 1\n), in agreement with literature data (P\u00e9ron et al., 2016), and within the range of the mantle production ratio 2-5 (Moreira and Kurz, 2013).\nThe Midfell sample (hereafter DG2017) was collected at the same location as the DICE sample from a subglacial lava flow (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021) and shows a noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Xe) isotopic compositions very similar to DICE (Colin et al., 2015; Harrison et al., 1999; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Trieloff et al., 2000). Sample DG-2017 has a 4He\/40Ar* ratio of 2.80 \u00b1 0.02, in agreement with previous measurements for the DICE sample, which have a 4He\/40Ar* ratio between 1.2 and 3.0 (Colin et al., 2015; Harrison et al., 1999; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Trieloff et al., 2000), so within the range of the mantle production ratio.\nSince He is about ten times more soluble in basaltic melts than Ar (Jambon et al., 1986), He and Ar can be fractionated during magmatic degassing (e.g., open system degassing). The 4He\/40Ar* is thus a proxy of degassing. If the measured 4He\/40Ar* ratios are close to the mantle production ratio (Moreira and Kurz, 2013), then no or minimal elemental fractionation has occurred and the measured elemental ratios are representative of the mantle source composition. Similarly, the 4He\/21Ne* and 40Ar*\/21Ne* ratios (21Ne* being nucleogenic 21Ne) of the samples are close to the mantle production ratios, indicating either no, or negligible, elemental fractionation (Table 1). Therefore, the measured noble gas elemental patterns of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland samples are representative of these two deep mantle sources.\n\n\n2.2\nNoble gas analyses\nThe He, Ne and Ar compositions of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots have been well studied (e.g., Colin et al., 2015; Furi et al., 2010; Harrison et al., 1999; Kurz et al., 2009; Moreira et al., 2001; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; P\u00e9ron et al., 2016; Trieloff et al., 2000). Due to the low abundances of Kr and Xe in these samples and the ubiquitous atmospheric contamination, the compositions of krypton and non-radiogenic xenon isotopes have only been determined recently (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). The new methodology used allows for the recovery of high purity fractions of Kr and Xe, nearly free of atmospheric contaminants (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). Sample D22A was measured once, sample D22B three times (D22B-1, D22B-2, D22B-3) and sample DG2017 twice (DG2017-1, DG2017-2). The isotopic ratios are discussed in P\u00e9ron et al. (2021), while this study focuses on the elemental ratios, in particular on the Xe\/Kr ratios.\nFrom the noble gas measurements (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021), the present-day noble gas elemental patterns of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots are determined here. The measured Xe\/Kr ratios are representative of the mantle sources as the new methodology used removes nearly all the surficial atmospheric Kr and Xe contamination. However, the methodology did not remove most of the surficial atmospheric Ar contamination (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021), and so the measured 36Ar\/84Kr ratios need to be corrected. To do so, the 36Ar\/84Kr ratios can be extrapolated to a mantle source 40Ar\/36Ar ratio of \u223c 8,500 (Supplementary Information) as the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots have 40Ar\/36Ar ratios of \u223c 8,500 (Colin et al., 2015; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; P\u00e9ron et al., 2016; Trieloff et al., 2000). Similarly, the Ne\/Kr ratios can be corrected for the small Ne atmospheric contaminant by extrapolating the measured (average) 20Ne\/22Ne ratios (Supplementary Information) to a mantle source 20Ne\/22Ne ratio of 12.90 (Colin et al., 2015; Mukhopadhyay, 2012; P\u00e9ron et al., 2016; Trieloff et al., 2000).\n\n\n2.3\nDetermination of the pre-subduction noble gas elemental ratios\nThe measured noble gas elemental patterns, corrected for shallow atmospheric contamination, as described above and in Supplementary Information, are the present-day elemental compositions of the mantle sources, which are an integration of the initial and recycled atmospheric signatures.\nIn this study, we estimate the initial noble gas elemental patterns of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland mantle sources by correcting the present-day average elemental ratios for atmospheric recycling (Table 1) as follows: Rcorr = (Fini\ni\/Fini\nj)*Rmeasured, with R= Abi\/Abj the ratio of abundances of elements i and j and Fini the initial proportion (=1-Frecycled) of each element. Hence, to apply the correction, the recycled atmospheric proportions (Frecycled) need to be evaluated for each noble gas. Note that this approach is different than the study of Yamamoto and Kurz (2022) which estimated the present-day elemental ratios, not the elemental ratios before subduction of atmospheric gases.\nThe proportions of recycled atmospheric Kr in the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland mantle sources have been determined in a previous study based on the 78Kr\/84Kr and 80Kr\/84Kr ratios (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021) considering either Phase Q or Average Carbonaceous Chondrites (AVCC) as the initial source. Importantly, while the 86Kr\/84Kr ratio is usually the most precise Kr isotopic ratio, the 86Kr\/84Kr ratio cannot be used to determine the proportion of recycled atmospheric Kr, since the deep mantle, at least as sampled by the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland mantle sources, has a deficit in 86Kr relative to AVCC (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). Precise 78Kr\/84Kr and 80Kr\/84Kr ratios have only been measured for the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland hotspots. Therefore, for other mantle-derived samples for which precise Kr isotopic measurements exist (Broadley et al., 2020a; Holland et al., 2009), we use the 82Kr\/84Kr ratio to estimate the proportion of recycled atmospheric Kr as a precaution, even if a deficit in 86Kr has not yet been ascertained for these mantle sources. The isotopes 82Kr and 84Kr are non-radiogenic in the mantle (the fission production of 84Kr is negligible in the mantle (Ozima and Podosek, 2002)) and so the mantle 82Kr\/84Kr ratio is a mixture of initial Kr and recycled atmospheric Kr. For Yellowstone, such an estimate is only possible for sample 4B as sample 4A shows a 82Kr\/84Kr ratio lower than AVCC (Broadley et al., 2020a). For CO2 well gases, representing the Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) mantle, we take the lowest measured 82Kr\/84Kr corrected for crustal fission (0.2015 \u00b1 0.0001) (Holland et al., 2009). For both Yellowstone and CO2 well gases, Phase Q does not seem an appropriate starting composition as they have 82Kr\/84Kr ratios intermediate between AVCC and Phase Q.\nTo estimate the proportions of recycled atmospheric xenon, we consider the 128Xe\/130Xe ratios. Since 128Xe and 130Xe are both non-radiogenic isotopes, the present-day mantle 128Xe\/130Xe ratio reflects a mixing between initial Xe and recycled atmospheric xenon. For the starting Xe isotopic composition, we use AVCC or Phase Q. The measured 128Xe\/130Xe of Yellowstone is first normalized to an atmospheric 128Xe\/130Xe ratio of 0.471 as in P\u00e9ron et al. (2021) since a value of 0.4715 was used in the original study (Broadley et al., 2020a). For both the proportions of recycled Kr (29-64%) and Xe (90-96%) in the mantle sources, errors have been propagated taking into account uncertainties on measured isotopic ratios for the mantle sources and initial chondritic compositions (AVCC, Phase Q).\nAs neon is likely not recycled efficiently in the mantle (Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014), we do not correct the neon abundance for recycling, that is we consider that 100% of present-day neon is from the initial source. A small amount of recycled neon in the mantle would not change the results of this study. Indeed, if initially the deep mantle had a 20Ne\/22Ne ratio of about 13.4 (Williams and Mukhopadhyay, 2019), then lowering this ratio to the maximum measured values of about 12.9-13.0 (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021; Williams and Mukhopadhyay, 2019) owing to subducted atmospheric Ne would indicate only 10-15% of the Ne is recycled in origin (Kendrick et al., 2018).\nThe case for Ar is less straightforward. Some studies argued that most (64%-100%) of the non-radiogenic Ar (36Ar and 38Ar) in the mantle is of recycled origin (Holland and Ballentine, 2006; Tucker et al., 2022). This is supported by the fact that the 38Ar\/36Ar ratio is atmospheric within uncertainties in the deep and MORB mantle (Raquin and Moreira, 2009). If about 100% of the budget of non-radiogenic Ar is from recycling, then the initial mantle 36Ar\/84Kr ratio would be close to 0 (Table 1), which does not seem very likely. The precision on the measured 38Ar\/36Ar ratio does not currently allow to distinguish whether the 38Ar\/36Ar ratio is atmospheric, chondritic or intermediate between the two, as Phase Q has a 38Ar\/36Ar ratio of 0.1873 \u00b1 0.0007 (Busemann et al., 2000), very close to the atmospheric ratio (0.1880). Instead, we note a progression in the percentage of recycled atmospheric gases from Xe, to Kr to Ne with \u226590%, to around 50%, to <15%, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesize that for Ar, the recycled proportion may range between that of Ne and Kr \u2013 i.e., 30 \u00b1 20% of Ar is from recycling, which covers the range of recycling from Ne to Kr. We further note that the Xe\/Kr ratio is the primary focus of the study and uncertainties in the proportion of recycled Ar in the mantle will not affect any of our main conclusions.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\nThe measured elemental ratios (corrected for shallow atmospheric contamination for 22Ne\/84Kr and 36Ar\/84Kr, section 2.2 and Supplementary Information) are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1\n. The measured elemental patterns for Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland are relatively similar to the seawater pattern, in particular with 130Xe\/84Kr ratios of 92 \n\u00b1\n1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n and 103 \u00b1 2 (1 \u03c3) \n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n, respectively, indistinguishable from the seawater ratio of \n96.9\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n (Ozima and Podosek, 2002). Note that similar 130Xe\/84Kr ratios (between \n100\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n and \n200\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n) were obtained in samples from Samoa (Poreda and Farley, 1992) and Iceland (Trieloff et al., 2000) for the steps with high 20Ne\/22Ne ratios (i.e., less atmospheric contamination), but atmospheric contamination in these samples prevents determining precise elemental ratios.\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland 36Ar\/84Kr ratios appear similar to seawater. Since the methodology may not remove a substantial fraction of atmospheric argon, the extrapolation (as explained in Section 2.2) to high 40Ar\/36Ar ratios is large and the 36Ar\/84Kr ratios may not be very reliable (and by extension the 36Ar\/84Kr ratios corrected for recycling). Classical step-crushing analyses may be better in estimating the present-day deep mantle 36Ar\/84Kr ratios.\nThe proportions of initial (pre-subduction) and recycled atmospheric Kr and Xe in the mantle sources are shown in Fig. 2\n and in Table 2\n. As can be seen, Xe has been more affected by recycling than Kr, with 90% or more of Xe from recycled origin and between 29% and 64% of Kr from atmosphere recycled into the mantle. The recycled proportions are upper limits as shallow atmospheric contamination was not completely removed from the data acquired for the samples shown in Table 2. So, the initial Kr and Xe proportions are lower limits. However, the shallow atmospheric contamination is small for the Kr and Xe analyses of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland samples using the accumulation protocol (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). For example, for Iceland, recycled 130Xe proportions of \u223c 93% were calculated after removing all of the shallow atmospheric contamination (Mukhopadhyay, 2012), similar to values (\u223c95%) reported with the new methodology used (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). Hence, the pre-subduction Xe\/Kr ratios calculated in the present study are not affected significantly, and importantly, do not affect our arguments.\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland elemental patterns show some surprising features corrected for atmospheric recycling (Figs. 3\u20134\n\n and Tables 2\u20133\n). For example, the corrected 130Xe\/84Kr ratios are 11.7 \u00b1 8.3 x10\u22124 and \n\n\n13.1\n\n\n\u2212\n13.1\n\n\n+\n16.0\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n (1 \u03c3) for Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland, respectively, assuming AVCC as a starting composition, significantly lower than the atmospheric (54.5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n) and seawater (\n96.9\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n) values. A similar observation (corrected 130Xe\/84Kr ratio of 5.2 \n\u00b1\n2.0\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n) can be drawn for one measurement from the Yellowstone hotspot (Broadley et al., 2020a). For the MORB mantle, as represented by CO2 well gases (Holland and Ballentine, 2006), the corrected 130Xe\/84Kr ratio (\n39.0\n\u00b1\n13.1\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n, 1 \u03c3) is slightly lower than the atmospheric value.\nUsing Phase Q as the starting composition to correct the 130Xe\/84Kr ratios for recycling also gives initial values for the Gal\u00e1pagos (\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n\u2212\n4.2\n\n\n+\n4.1\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n, 1 \u03c3) and Iceland (\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\u2212\n6.6\n\n\n+\n8.0\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n, 1 \u03c3) hotspots significantly lower than the atmospheric and seawater values (Table 2 and Fig. 3).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nNoble gas primordial isotopic ratios (e.g., 20Ne\/22Ne) and radiogenic\/non-radiogenic isotopic ratios (e.g., 129Xe\/130Xe) represent tracers of volatile sources as well as processes such as degassing and regassing. Noble gas elemental ratios are likewise affected by source compositions and physical processes such as magma ocean outgassing and core formation. Therefore, elemental ratios provide additional constraints on processes that have affected Earth's volatile accretion and evolution. Here, we first establish a Xe deficit in the deep mantle in section 4.1, then discuss the noble gas recycling efficiencies in section 4.2, and finally propose possible processes responsible for the deep mantle Xe depletion in section 4.3.\n\n4.1\nIdentification of a Xe deficit in the deep mantle\nThe main observation from this study is that the deep mantle 130Xe\/84Kr ratios corrected for atmospheric recycling are significantly lower than the atmospheric and seawater values. In other words, the initial deep mantle 130Xe\/84Kr ratio was lower than any known sources (Fig. 4), and hence there was a significant deficit of xenon relative to krypton in the Earth's deep mantle. Xenon was depleted relative to chondrites by two orders of magnitude (Tables 1, 2 and Fig. 4). Xenon also appears depleted in the MORB mantle, although to a much lesser extent. More measurements would be needed to confirm such an observation for MORB mantle sources. We now explore whether mantle degassing associated with partial melting, recycling of surficial atmospheric gases, or some combination of the two can produce the extremely low Xe\/Kr ratio in the mantle if the starting interior composition was near chondritic.\nPartial melting and degassing in its present-day style could potentially fractionate xenon from krypton, but only if both elements had significantly different crystal\/melt partition coefficients. Given the incompatibility of Kr and Xe (see Supplementary Information for arguments about potential compatible behavior of Xe) during partial melting (Brooker et al., 2003; Heber et al., 2007), loss of volatiles from the mantle through plate-tectonic style degassing processes would not change the mantle's Xe\/Kr ratio. The krypton and xenon olivine-melt and clinopyroxene-melt partition coefficients are relatively similar, on the order of 10\u22124 (Heber et al., 2007). Using Heber et al. (2007)'s partitioning data, and assuming a typical partial melting of 1-10%, the Xe\/Kr ratio could vary by at most <10%. Similarly, the processes of recycling and mixing slabs in the mantle, assuming no surficial gases in the slabs for the time being, would not change the Xe\/Kr ratio by two orders of magnitude. Taking the same approach as Tucker and Mukhopadhyay (2014) with the largest differences in the Kr and Xe partition coefficients (Heber et al., 2007), an average partial melting of 5%, and a mantle composition with 60% olivine, 20% clinopyroxene, 20% orthopyroxene (assuming the Kr and Xe partition coefficients are similar for clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene), we determine that the Xe\/Kr ratio of the mantle could vary by at most 18% after 10 reservoir masses have been processed. Therefore, partial melting and recycling of barren slabs into the mantle cannot explain why the initial mantle Xe\/Kr ratio is depleted by two orders of magnitude compared to chondritic values.\nWe consider whether injection of surficial gases into the mantle could be responsible for the observed Xe\/Kr ratio. The atmosphere Xe\/Kr ratio is about one order of magnitude lower than chondrites (Dauphas, 2003; Halliday, 2013; Marty, 2012; Pepin, 1991; Pepin and Porcelli, 2002). Atmospheric xenon is also enriched in heavy isotopes relative to solar and chondritic xenon by about 3-4% amu\u22121 (Avice et al., 2018; Marty, 2012; Pepin, 1991). These two characteristics are known as the missing xenon paradox. A theoretical starting composition, called U-Xe, combined with xenon loss from the atmosphere, can explain the xenon isotopic feature of Earth's atmosphere (Pepin, 1991; Pepin and Porcelli, 2002). The U-Xe composition has since been found to consist of a mixture of about 20% cometary Xe with 80% chondritic Xe (Marty et al., 2017). Analyses of ancient atmospheric xenon trapped in fluid inclusions of Archean cherts and barites show that the atmospheric xenon isotopic composition progressively evolved from the U-Xe composition to reach the present-day composition at around 2.4 Ga (Ardoin et al., 2022; Avice et al., 2018; Pujol et al., 2011). Contrary to models that suggest Xe loss from the Earth's atmosphere associated with accretional processes (e.g., Pepin, 1991), the Archean chert observations require protracted Xe loss from Earth's atmosphere over the first 2.4 Ga (e.g., Ardoin et al., 2022). Subduction of gases from post-2.4 Ga surficial reservoirs (atmosphere, seawater), however, cannot explain the Xe deficit (low Xe\/Kr) of the deep interior as the interior has a lower Xe\/Kr than the surface. Pre-2.4 Ga, the surface reservoirs would have a lower degree of xenon depletion and a higher Xe\/Kr than the modern-day atmosphere (Broadley et al., 2022). Thus, subduction early in Earth's history, if prevalent, would pose an even bigger challenge in explaining the low Xe\/Kr of the deep interior. Hence, recycling of ancient or modern atmosphere is not a viable process to account for the deep mantle Xe depletion. Furthermore, given the very small variations in Xe\/Kr ratios induced by mantle outgassing and partial melting, recycling of surficial gases combined with mantle outgassing and partial melting cannot explain the exceedingly low Xe\/Kr ratio in the Earth's deep interior (Fig. 4).\nThe evidence from the 3He\/22Ne ratio, I\/Pu-derived Xe and \n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n182\n\n\nW show that the deep mantle was largely isolated from the rest of the mantle by about 4.45 Ga ago (Mukhopadhyay, 2012; Mundl-Petermeier et al., 2020; Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014). As the deep mantle Xe depletion cannot be acquired from subduction of surficial gases reservoirs at any time during Earth's history, the xenon depletion in the deep mantle occurred very early, most likely during Earth's accretion. Later on, the deep mantle was partly replenished in Xe from recycling of atmospheric heavy noble gases via subduction (Parai and Mukhopadhyay, 2015) although atmospheric Xe was not recycled efficiently into the mantle before 3 Ga ago (Parai and Mukhopadhyay, 2018; P\u00e9ron and Moreira, 2018). In contrast to the mantle Xe deficit being set at accretion, the xenon deficit in the atmosphere was acquired over a protracted time through Xe loss to space involving trapping of ionized xenon onto organics or hydrodynamic escape of ionized xenon (Avice et al., 2018; H\u00e9brard and Marty, 2014; Pepin, 1991; Zahnle et al., 2019). Thus, the magnitude, timing and process(es) of xenon depletion are different between the Earth's interior and the atmosphere and \u2018missing xenon\u2019 in the Earth's interior and atmosphere are two separate and distinct problems.\n\n\n4.2\nNoble gas recycling efficiencies into the mantle\n\n4.2.1\nThe case for Ar\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3, the proportion of recycled atmospheric Ar in the mantle remains unclear although the general assumption has been that about 100% of mantle's non-radiogenic Ar budget is from recycled origin (Holland and Ballentine, 2006). However, the recycling efficiency of Ar may be expected to be more similar to Kr (or lower). Such a hypothesis is supported by enrichments in Kr and Xe over Ar in most of the altered recycled oceanic crust and serpentinites compared to seawater (Chavrit et al., 2016; Kendrick et al., 2013), and experimentally determined Ar solubilities in serpentinites that are lower compared to Kr and Xe (Krantz et al., 2019). Furthermore, we suggest that during subduction, Ar might be preferentially lost over Kr and Xe through diffusion at depths corresponding to arc magma genesis and preferentially returned to the surface via arc volcanism. The hypothesis of Ar not being significantly recycled into the mantle is in agreement with a recent study showing that ingassing 36Ar fluxes are balanced by outgassing 36Ar fluxes in the Central American subduction zone (Labidi et al., 2021). We, therefore, hypothesize that a substantial fraction of non-radiogenic mantle Ar is of primordial origin, between \u223c50 and \u223c86% to reflect the recycling range between Ne and Kr (in other words, between \u223c14 and \u223c50% of non-radiogenic Ar would be from recycling). Such a proportion for primordial Ar in the mantle would still result in 38Ar\/36Ar ratios very close to the atmospheric value (> 0.187) if Phase Q or AVCC was the starting composition (Busemann et al., 2000; Mazor et al., 1970; Pepin, 1991). On the contrary, if initial mantle Ar was more similar to solar (Heber et al., 2009), the present-day mantle would be expected to have 38Ar\/36Ar ratios < 0.187 with such a high proportion of initial Ar. Unequivocal evidence for such low values has not yet been presented. High precision measurements on 38Ar\/36Ar ratios for samples minimally affected by air contamination are needed to better evaluate the proportion of recycled atmospheric Ar in the mantle.\n\n\n4.2.2\nThe case for Kr and Xe\nAfter correcting for recycling, the initial 130Xe\/84Kr ratios of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland mantle sources are lower than the atmospheric and seawater values, whereas their present-day ratios are similar to seawater within uncertainties (Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, the recycling component may have a 130Xe\/84Kr ratio similar to, or higher than seawater. The curvature of the hyperbolic mixing in a 128Xe\/130Xe vs. 78Kr\/84Kr space (Fig. 5\n) is r = (130Xe\/84Kr)initial mantle\/(130Xe\/84Kr)recycled component, with the initial mantle having AVCC-like Kr and Xe isotopic ratios and the recycled component having an atmospheric Kr and Xe isotopic composition. Considering the average isotopic ratios for Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland, we determined with the Matlab function fit that the hyperbola curvature r is 0.092 \u00b1 0.019 (1 \u03c3) in Fig. 5. Given the corrected 130Xe\/84Kr ratio of the Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland mantle sources (Table 2) and the curvature of the hyperbola, we calculate that the recycled component would have a 130Xe\/84Kr ratio of \u223c 0.013 - 0.014, that is slightly higher than seawater. Uncertainties on this latter value are large (\u223c 0.01) as it depends on the uncertainties of the initial mantle (corrected) 130Xe\/84Kr ratio, which in turn depends on the uncertainties of the measured Kr and Xe isotopic ratios at Gal\u00e1pagos and Iceland (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). More measurements of the Kr and Xe isotopic composition of the deep mantle would allow one to refine these estimates. Nonetheless, the recycled component appears to be similar to, or slightly enriched in Xe relative to seawater. Therefore, assuming that the Xe\/Kr ratio of the subducting package is similar to that of seawater, Xe would be as efficiently recycled, or slightly more efficiently recycled into the mantle compared to Kr.\nThe significant xenon depletion in the deep mantle compared to krypton, along with the recycling efficiency of Xe being at least as high as Kr suggests that the initial isotopic composition of xenon would be more susceptible to being overprinted by recycling of atmospheric noble gases. This provides an explanation for why only barely resolvable excesses in the non-radiogenic 124Xe\/130Xe, 126Xe\/130Xe and 128Xe\/130Xe ratios relative to air are detected in deep mantle sources, and why the proportions of initial Xe in the deep mantle are much lower compared to Kr (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). In contrast, the MORB mantle shows higher excesses relative to air for the non-radiogenic Xe isotopes (Holland and Ballentine, 2006; P\u00e9ron and Moreira, 2018), which may be due to a lower extent of Xe depletion and so higher proportions of initial Xe compared to the deep mantle (Parai and Mukhopadhyay, 2015).\n\n\n\n4.3\nOrigin of the deep mantle Xe deficit\nSeveral processes, discussed below, are envisaged to generate a xenon deficit in mantle sources. Partial melting and degassing, along with subduction of surficial noble gases, discussed in section 4.1, are shown not to cause significant Xe\/Kr variations. But, three other processes could possibly account for the deep mantle xenon deficit, namely partitioning of Xe into the core, magma ocean outgassing and a low Xe\/Kr ratio of the Earth's parent bodies, none of which are mutually exclusive.\n\n4.3.1\nPartitioning of Xe into the core\nEvidence for partitioning of xenon into the Earth's core are limited and remain highly debated, as reviewed by Sanloup (2020). Xe metallization occurs at about 155 GPa (Eremets et al., 2000). Initial experimental determination of Xe behavior at pressures up to 150 GPa did not find evidence for alloy formation between Xe and Fe (Caldwell et al., 1997). While ab-initio calculations showed that Xe could form an alloy with hexagonally closed-packed iron at pressures relevant for the Earth's core (Lee and Steinle-Neumann, 2006), experimental evidence suggested that Xe does not form an alloy with iron at conditions relevant for the Earth's outer core (Nishio-Hamane et al., 2010). Recent, first-principles calculations with structure search, and experiments, suggest that Xe could form stable compounds with Fe and Ni (XeFe3 and XeNi3) above 200 GPa, relevant for inner core conditions (Stavrou et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2014).\nAlthough Xe could be incorporated into the Earth's core through formation of Xe-Ni and Xe-Fe compounds, how much Xe could be removed into the core through these reactions remains unclear. In particular, the Earth's core is thought to have formed at much lower pressures (around 50 GPa in average), which would not have allowed Xe alloy formation during core formation (Stavrou et al., 2018). However, we cannot rule out that xenon was sequestered into the core at a later stage, after magma ocean solidification, through deep mantle \u2013 core equilibration. Such a scenario would run counter to ideas of the core fluxing the deep mantle with primordial noble gases. Importantly, to explain the deep mantle xenon deficit, Xe would need to be preferentially incorporated into the core over Kr. Whether Kr would form an alloy with Fe and Ni is not known (Sanloup, 2020).\nAnother possibility for preferentially removing Xe over Kr into the core during Earth's accretion is through metal and silicate equilibration in a magma ocean. At lower pressures of 6 GPa, Xe has a slight preference over Kr for a metallic liquid, although for both gases the metal-silicate partition coefficient is < 1 (Matsuda et al., 1993). However, the relative solubilities of krypton and xenon in metal and silicate liquids at high pressures and high temperatures relevant to core formation have not been determined. Only the Kr storage capacity of ferropericlase and liquid iron has been experimentally determined up to 60-115 GPa and suggest a limited Kr content in metallic liquid compared to ferropericlase (Rosa et al., 2020). Thus, we cannot completely assess whether metal-silicate equilibration may have preferentially partitioned Xe over Kr into the core and led to the deep Earth's Xe depletion.\n\n\n4.3.2\nMagma ocean outgassing\nDuring a magma ocean stage, the Xe\/Kr ratio of the magma ocean in equilibrium with an atmosphere can be changed by a factor equal to the solubility ratio of the two gases. Although the krypton and xenon solubilities for the temperatures and compositions relevant to magma ocean have not been determined, xenon is the noble gas with the lowest solubility in silicate melts (Carroll and Stolper, 1993; Jambon et al., 1986). The Xe\/Kr solubility ratio (SXe\/SKr) was determined to be about 0.43-0.57 for basaltic melt at 1350-1400 \u00b0C (Jambon et al., 1986; Lux, 1987). Hence, one mechanism to decrease the deep mantle Xe\/Kr ratio compared to the chondritic ratio could be magma ocean outgassing.\nIf deep mantle krypton and xenon originated from chondrites, or more broadly from meteorites, as isotopic data suggest (Broadley et al., 2020a; P\u00e9ron et al., 2021), then the deep mantle Xe\/Kr ratio could be decreased from \n1370\n\u2212\n2000\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n (Table 1) to about \n600\n\u2212\n800\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n4\n\n\n through one magma ocean outgassing stage. This does not explain the two order of magnitude Xe deficit in the deep mantle relative to chondrites. While this calculation is based on solubilities in a basaltic liquid, a magma ocean would be ultramafic with a liquidus temperature of 2000 K. The Xe\/Kr solubility ratio for an ultramafic liquid would have to be more than a factor of 100 different from that in a basaltic liquid to explain the observed deep Earth Xe\/Kr through a single stage of magma ocean outgassing. Such a large difference appears to be unlikely as the He\/Ne solubility ratio for magma ocean degassing appears to vary by 20-30% compared to values in basaltic liquids (Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014).\nIf magma ocean outgassing was responsible for the deep mantle Xe deficit, then several magma ocean outgassing stages would be needed. Note that ingassing into a magma ocean from a chondritic-like Kr, Xe atmosphere would also generate a lower Xe\/Kr ratio in the magma ocean compared to the chondritic values according to the solubility ratio. Ingassing followed by several magma ocean outgassing stages may account for the deep mantle Xe deficit. However, several magma ocean outgassing phases, or ingassing combined with several magma ocean outgassing phases would also increase the 3He\/22Ne ratio of the deep Earth above values of 2.5-3, which is not consistent with the observations (Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014). Therefore, magma ocean outgassing (and ingassing) does not seem like a viable process on its own to explain the deep mantle Xe deficit relative to chondrites. The MORB mantle may, however, have experienced more than one phase of magma ocean outgassing (Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014), potentially accounting for part of the Xe depletion in the MORB mantle relative to chondrites.\n\n\n4.3.3\nLow Xe\/Kr ratio of the Earth's parent bodies\nA third possibility to account for the initially low Xe\/Kr ratio of the deep mantle may be Earth's building blocks were carrying such a signature. Building blocks with nearly two orders of magnitude Xe deficits relative to chondritic Kr abundances, but with Kr and Xe isotopic ratios similar to chondrites, would be required. No potential volatile sources have been identified so far with such a chemical signature (Fig. 4). We note that for some other isotope systems, such as Nd, Mo, Ru, the Earth is an end-member and no mixtures of known meteorites would produce the Earth's isotopic composition (e.g., Render et al., 2017).\nEarth may have accreted from differentiated bodies as represented by achondrites (Carlson et al., 2014). Some ureilites, achondrites from the inner solar system, show lower Xe\/Kr ratios, up to a factor 5 lower than Phase Q (Broadley et al., 2020b). However, achondrites, including ureilites, show Kr isotopic compositions similar to Phase Q (Broadley et al., 2020b) and initial deep mantle Kr does not match Phase Q isotopically (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). Thus, whether achondrites could account for the deep mantle noble gas budget remains unclear.\nComets may have a xenon deficit relative to Kr and chondrites. Experiments of gas trapping in ices carried out to investigate the potential cometary compositions show that, starting from a solar composition, ices end up with a low Xe\/Kr ratio, at least a factor of two lower compared to the solar ratio (Bar-Nun and Owen, 1998; Owen et al., 1992).\nMeasurements of the coma of the comet 67P\/C-G during the Rosetta mission found a 130Xe\/84Kr ratio of about 0.042 (Marty et al., 2017; Rubin et al., 2018), which is lower than chondritic values but considerably higher than the observed values for the deep Earth (Fig. 4). Hence, comets seem to show a Xe depletion relative to Kr and chondrites, but the possible extent of this depletion by itself does not seem to be able to match the observed value in the deep Earth. The lack of observational data from comets do not allow us to conclude whether comet 67P\/C-G is representative of other cometary objects. Nonetheless, given the experimental data and observation from comet 67P\/C-G, the deep mantle Xe depletion may be partly attributed to the Earth's parent bodies.\nFrom an isotopic perspective, comets have Kr isotopic ratios more similar to solar with potentially a deficit in 86Kr, based on data from comet 67P\/C-G (Rubin et al., 2018). The deep mantle shows Kr isotopic ratios close to chondritic values with a deficit in 86Kr interpreted as a nucleosynthetic anomaly (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). The deep mantle Kr and Xe elemental and isotopic data would then require a mix of chondritic objects with cometary-like bodies carrying a low Xe\/Kr ratio and a deficit in 86Kr. We note that the origin of the nucleosynthetic 86Kr anomaly in the deep mantle remains unclear and may be carried by other meteorites not yet in our collections (P\u00e9ron et al., 2021). Overall, our study highlights that different types of planetesimals, some possibly from the outer solar system, may have contributed to the deep mantle volatile budget.\n\n\n4.3.4\nSummary\nThe three scenarios discussed above, partitioning of Xe into the core, magma ocean outgassing and a low Xe\/Kr ratio of the Earth's parent bodies, by themselves, seem unable to explain the unusually low Xe\/Kr ratio of the Earth's deep mantle. Potentially, all of these processes, acting in sync, may have contributed towards producing the deep mantle Xe deficit relative to chondrites. A more critical evaluation of these hypotheses, along with the relative importance of these processes, will require xenon partitioning data between metal and silicates at high pressures and temperatures as well as krypton and xenon solubilities in ultramafic liquids at the conditions of a magma ocean. Additional measurements of extraterrestrial material will also be crucial towards this goal.\n\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe determined the noble gas elemental pattern of mantle sources prior to the introduction of recycled atmospheric noble gases into the mantle, i.e., the mantle's initial elemental pattern. The initial deep mantle source patterns show a xenon depletion of about two orders of magnitude relative to chondritic values, and a larger xenon depletion relative to krypton compared to the modern-day atmosphere. This xenon depletion relative to krypton was most likely acquired during Earth's formation as degassing associated with partial melting processes and subduction of surficial noble gases cannot produce the mantle's observed Xe\/Kr ratio. The MORB mantle also seems to have a Xe depletion that is larger than the atmosphere, but to a lesser extent than the deep mantle. More data are needed for the MORB mantle sources to confirm this observation.\nThree processes are envisaged to explain the initial Xe deficit of the deep mantle: (i) core-mantle interactions, (ii) magma ocean outgassing, (iii) low Xe\/Kr ratio of the parent bodies. These processes, acting individually, may not explain the deep mantle xenon deficit. However, the three scenarios are not mutually exclusive and a combination of volatile source(s) with core-mantle partitioning and magma ocean outgassing may have been responsible for the initial deep mantle composition.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nSandrine P\u00e9ron: Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft.

Throughout this region, present-day oceanic spreading ridges and plates are 1\u20132 km shallower than expected and fringing continental margins are elevated (White and McKenzie, 1989). Existence of a large mantle plume with a buoyancy flux of up to 20 Mgs\u22121 has been confirmed by regional seismic tomographic models which image a substantial and irregular-shaped negative shear-wave velocity anomaly beneath the lithospheric plates (e.g. Schoonman et al., 2017). There is interest in determining how the Icelandic plume has evolved through geologic time (White and McKenzie, 1989). The spatial and temporal distribution of Cenozoic magmatism suggests that this plume initiated at about 64 Myrs and that its planform rapidly expanded. At 55 Myrs, continental rifting and seafloor spreading accompanied large-scale basaltic magmatism triggered by decompression melting. Plume activity has also waxed and waned on shorter timescales. Compelling evidence for fluctuating plume behavior relies on the fact that the plume is transected by a mid-oceanic ridge, which acts as a linear window into temporal variability of the underlying thermal structure. The resultant pattern of time-transgressive V-shaped ridges and troughs that straddle the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland enables a record of radial thermal fluctuations to be reconstructed (Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). These fluctuations are \n\u00b1\n30\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC with a periodicity of O(3\u20135) Myrs. Paleogene fluctuations are thought to have triggered periodic regional continental uplift and deposition of clastic submarine fans (White and Lovell, 1997). Mapping of three-dimensional (3D) seismic reflection surveys calibrated by borehole measurements reveals buried terrestrial landscapes that are sandwiched between marine strata. One dramatic example shows that rapid uplift and subsidence with an amplitude of 500\u2013800 m occurred at \n55.80\n\u00b1\n0.50\n Myrs (Hartley et al., 2011). This scale of transient uplift cannot be reconciled with glacio-eustatic mechanisms. Instead, rapid uplift and subsidence are generated when an asthenospheric thermal anomaly spreading away from the center of the Icelandic plume is advected beneath the margin.\nHere, we present evidence for an entire sequence of transient buried landscapes associated with coeval volcanism that developed during Paleogene times. These stratigraphically discrete landscapes are stacked upon each other, recording a succession of regional uplift events that are thought to have been generated by the horizontal advection of thermal fluctuations beneath the lithospheric plate\u2014 an hypothesis that is corroborated by subsequent Neogene behavior of the Icelandic plume (Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). We explore the connections between five prominent landscapes and a series of paleoclimatic aberrations\u2014 the global hyperthermal events of Paleogene times. Our primary aim is to determine the extent to which there may be a genetic relationship between plume activity and transient landscape development and whether or not these events intrude upon the global climatic signal. Finally, we suggest that the combination of Icelandic plume activity and lithospheric rifting between Greenland and Northwest Europe triggered a longer period oscillation of Paleogene cooling and warming. This oscillation can be accounted for by regional silicate weathering during the initial stages of plume activity followed by a period of volcanic degassing when plume-generated magmatism increased during separation of the North American and Eurasian plates.\n\n\n2\nStratigraphic unconformities and ancient buried landscapes\n\n2.1\nRegional framework\nWe describe a sequence of buried terrestrial landscapes that punctuate Cenozoic marine strata within the Faroe-Shetland basin (Fig. 1b). These landscapes were mapped on a 3D seismic reflection survey that covers \n2\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n km2 (Appendix). This survey is calibrated with 36 boreholes, enabling lithologic, biostratigraphic and depositional constraints to be integrated with reflectivity mapping. The chronology of significant stratigraphic events is determined using a detailed regional biostratigraphic framework that has been recalibrated with respect to a modern orbitally tuned global timescale (Fig. 2\n; Speijer et al., 2020; Mudge and Bujak, 2001). This framework is based upon bioevents of dinoflagellate cysts, foraminifera, pollen, radiolaria and diatoms from four boreholes located along the axis of the Faroe-Shetland basin (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Information). Biostratigraphic analysis is primarily based upon conventional core and sidewall core material, supplemented by ditch cuttings.\nThe sedimentary basin was formed by Late Cretaceous lithospheric rifting followed by Cenozoic thermal subsidence (Shaw Champion et al., 2008). Paleogene stratigraphy is characterized by marine deposition that is interrupted by erosional unconformities, which are capped by terrestrial strata (Knox et al., 1997). We examine in detail four surfaces, Q\u2013T, that were sub-aerially exposed, incised and rapidly buried. There is regional evidence for a fifth older surface which is not mappable within the Faroe-Shetland basin. On a single vertical slice through the seismic volume, these four stacked surfaces are manifest as irregular reflective surfaces (Fig. 3\n). Each surface was mapped by hand-picking in-lines and cross-lines (i.e. orthogonal vertical slices) with a resolution of \u223c30 m. Post-depositional folding is removed from unconformities Q and R by flattening the top surface of the Balder Formation and from unconformities S and T by flattening topset surfaces of the Stronsay delta. Depth conversion, decompaction and isostatic unloading were carried out using 29 borehole checkshot surveys (Appendix; Shaw Champion et al., 2008). These four landscapes reveal patterns of dendritic drainage characterized by over-steepened slopes and spurs that are typical of eroding landscapes where soft lithologies undergo rapid uplift (Fig. 4\n).\n\n\n2.2\nLandscape Q\nThe oldest Landscape Q initiated at 59.15 \u00b1 0.45 Myrs when an erosional unconformity cut into the underlying Vaila Formation. This formation comprises marine carbonate muds and sandstones (Figs. 2 and 3b; Knox et al., 1997). The pattern of erosional incision together with subsequent deposition of lignite are consistent with development of a fluvial landscape. The age of this important sequence boundary, which marks the top of the Vaila Formation, is biostratigraphically constrained by a marked change of the dominant dinocyst species from Areoligera cf. coronata and P. pyrophorum to Areoligera gippingensis (Mudge and Bujak, 2001). Immediately above this boundary, the agglutinated foraminifera Reticulophragmium cf. garcilassoi, which is confined to Thanetian times, occurs. The exposure duration of Landscape Q is limited to \u22642.5 Myr since the short-lived Alisocysta margarita occurs immediately above and below the sequence boundary (Speijer et al., 2020). This buried landscape is dominated by a major catchment with a prominent sinuous channel that has a relief of 310 m (Fig. 4a). Interlocking spurs occur within the higher reaches of this channel where steep tributaries are visible. Landscape Q is overlain by the Kettla Tuff Member of the Lamba Formation (Fig. 3; Knox et al., 1997). This tuff manifests a surge of volcanism associated with Phase 1 of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (White and McKenzie, 1989).\n\n\n2.3\nLandscape R\nThe overlying Lamba Formation comprises a prograding deltaic sequence that contains Thanetian agglutinated benthic foraminifera, notably S. spectabilis and Reticulophragmium cf. garcilassoi, confirming the transient nature of Landscape Q (Knox et al., 1997). The upper boundary of this formation is the exquisitely preserved Landscape R, which initiated at 55.80 \u00b1 0.8 Myrs (Shaw Champion et al., 2008; Hartley et al., 2011). From a biostratigraphic perspective, this sequence boundary marks a dramatic shift from agglutinated benthic foraminifera to calcareous benthic foraminifera and diatom-restricted microfaunas (Mudge and Bujak, 2001). The short-lived Apectodinium augustum, which is characteristically abundant at this boundary, defines the Thanetian-Ypresian transition at 56 Myrs (Fig. 2). Sub-aerial exposure of Landscape R lasted <2 Myrs in accordance with the first and last appearance datums of Apectodinium augustum within the Flett formation, the common occurrence of Cerodinium wardenense, and the abundant occurrence of Caryapollenites spp. (Fig. 2; Mudge and Bujak, 2001; Speijer et al., 2020).\nWe revised and augmented the mapping of this landscape using additional seismic reflection surveys (Fig. 4b). It is bisected by a dramatic meandering channel, which has \u223c8 major tributary channels. The spatial pattern of knickzones along these channels delineates three peneplains at elevations of 200 m, 450 m and 750 m with reference to the base of the prominent paleo-seacliff (Supplementary Information). Landscape R has a relief of 500\u2013750 m. It is infilled by the Flett Formation, which is a terrestrial unit containing lignite beds and pollen assemblages dominated by Bombacacidites and Caryapollenites (Fig. 3; Mudge and Bujak, 2001). This formation is overlain by tuffs and mudstones of the Balder Formation, heralding a rapid return to marine conditions (Fig. 3; Knox et al., 1997). An equivalent landscape is recognized in the North Sea basin (Stucky de Quay et al., 2017).\n\n\n2.4\nLandscapes S and T\nThe lower part of the overlying Stronsay Group comprises \u223c100 m-high northward prograding clinoformal surfaces dominated by marine sandstones and mudstones (Fig. 3). Upper surfaces of two deltas have rugose geometries that constitute landscapes S and T (Fig. 4c and d). Both landscapes are overlain by lignite fragments, by carbonaceous material, and by tuffs, indicative of sub-aerial exposure with coeval volcanism. A combination of the first appearance datum of Dracodinium simile within underlying strata and last appearance datums of Homotryblium tenuispinosum and Dracodinium politum within overlying strata shows that this pair of landscapes developed between 54.3 and 51.7 Myrs (Speijer et al., 2020). In the adjacent Rockall basin, Stoker et al. (2012) document the existence of two sub-aerially exposed unconformities that correspond to landscapes S and T. The stratigraphic section that spans both unconformities correlates with nannoplankton zone NP10 and with lowermost NP12, based upon the combined presence of Adnatosphaeridium multispinosum, Adnatosphaeridium robustum, Achilleodinium biformoides, Achomosphaera alcicornu, Homotryblium tenuispinosum and Wetzeliella spp. Significantly landscapes S and T and their temporal equivalents in the Rockall basin are separated by occurrences of Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, which has a last appearance datum of \u223c53 Myrs. Thus, it is safe to conclude that Landscape S was incised between 54.3 and 53.0 Myrs and that Landscape T was incised between 53.0 and 51.7 Myrs. Landscape S is characterized by a large canyon with steep slopes above which lies an extensive peneplain (Fig. 4c). This canyon is 25 km long and cuts down into prograding clinoformal surfaces of the underlying deltaic deposits (Fig. 3). Minor catchments occur along the eastern escarpment. Landscape T is characterized by a series of catchments that are distributed along a 15 km-long northeast-facing slope (Fig. 4d).\n\n\n2.5\nRegional context\nWe contend that the degree of exquisite detail recorded by these preserved landscapes and recovered by 3D seismic reflection surveying is remarkable. The causes of this unprecedented degree of preservation are threefold. First, these landscapes developed within a paleoenvironmental Goldilocks zone which enhanced their preservation potential. If pre-existing water depths had been greater than several hundred meters, it is unlikely that this continental margin would have been sub-aerially exposed at all. If, on the other hand, pre-existing water depths had been negligible, more prolonged sub-aerial exposure would have given rise to wholesale peneplanation. Secondly, regional uplift was short-lived, which means that these transient landscapes were rapidly submerged. Thirdly, subsequent sedimentation rates were rapid so that submarine erosion did not occur (Supplementary Information). This particular combination of water depth, transient uplift and sedimentation rate has ensured preservation of these delicately sculpted surfaces.\nFragmentary evidence supports the existence of these four buried landscapes throughout the North Atlantic region (Fig. 1a). However, erosional surfaces are often featureless peneplains where only the deepest incised structures are locally preserved. For example, in the Paris basin a 6\u20137 Myr hiatus between Thanetian sedimentary rocks of the Chalons sur Vesles and Moulin Compens\u00e9 formations and underlying Danian chalk deposits has been linked to a regional uplift event that coincides with Landscape Q (Gale and Lovell, 2020). In southern England, a similar hiatus occurs between the Thanet Formation and Late Cretaceous deposits where \u223c500 m of chalk are absent. However, both hiatuses are too protracted to make definitive correlations. In the Kangerlussuaq basin of East Greenland, the Vandfaldsdalen Formation, consisting of pillow basalts and hyaloclastites, is overlain by lava flows with oxidized surfaces, implying a transition from submarine to sub-aerial conditions that is coeval with Landscape Q (Brooks, 2011). Burgeoning evidence supports the regional extent of Landscape R. For example, a deeply incised erosional surface lies beneath the Harwich formation of the London basin (King, 2016). Here, the estuarine Blackheath Formation records a return to marine conditions by \u223c55 Myrs. This major sequence boundary is one of a number of erosional surfaces that occur throughout southern England at this time. Coeval erosional surfaces are recognized along the Norwegian and Greenland continental margins and on the fringes of the Jan Mayen microcontinent (see, e.g., Ren et al., 2003; Storey et al., 2007; Dalhoff et al., 2003). There is widespread evidence supporting the existence of landscapes S and T. In the Kortrijk region of Belgium, the boundary between the Upper and Lower Roubaix Clay Formation is a marked erosional surface that represents relative sea-level fall (Steurbaut and King, 2017). This boundary is correlated with the deeply incised base of the Portsmouth Member of the Hampshire basin and it is coeval with Landscape T. Coastal outcrops along Van Keulenfjorden of Spitsbergen preserve slope deposits of the Batfjellet Formation onto which landscapes are sculpted and then overlain by the Aspelintoppen Formation (Plink-Bj\u00f6rklund and Steel, 2006). The stratigraphic setting, morphology and estimated duration suggest that these landscapes are coeval with S and T. Sudermann et al. (2021) describe a stratigraphic succession at Stenkul Fiord of Ellesmere Island where a volcanic ash band with a U\/Pb age of \n53.7\n\u00b1\n0.06\n Myrs lies close to an unconformity.\nFinally, there is fragmentary field evidence for an erosional surface that precedes Landscape Q. For example, Dam (2002) describes an unconformity associated with sub-aerial exposure in the Nuussuaq region of West Greenland (Landscape P). Terrestrial sandstones of the Paatuutkl\u00f8ften Formation cut down into marine mudstones of the mid-Danian Tupaasat Formation by \u223c200 m. These Paleogene strata were buried and compacted by \u223c2 km of overburden. In order to estimate the original relief of this buried landscape, we assume an initial porosity of 0.5 and a compaction decay length of 2.5 km which yields a corrected relief of \n280\n\u00b1\n10\n m. This terrestrial surface was subsequently buried by hyaloclastic deposits that are coeval with a volcanic deposit with an 40Ar\/39Ar date of 60.9\u201361.3 Myrs (Dam, 2002). Fragments of Landscape P are distributed throughout the North Atlantic region. Larsen et al. (1999) describe a correlative unconformity from the Kangerlussuaq basin (Dam, 2002). Offshore West Greenland, a Danian-Selandian unconformity occurs between the Markland and Cartwright formations.\n\n\n\n3\nGlobal hyperthermal aberrations\n\n3.1\nTransient activity of Icelandic plume\nThe scale and periodicity of regional uplift associated with these multiple buried landscapes suggest that they are generated by thermal fluctuations which spread away the center of the Icelandic mantle plume (Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). When a thermal fluctuation advects horizontally beneath the fringing continental margins, a phase of transient uplift is generated (Figs. 1 and 5\n; Rudge et al., 2008). Isostatic arguments show that regional uplift, U, generated by a thermal fluctuation, \u0394T, is given by\n\n(1)\n\nU\n=\n\n\n2\nh\n\u03b1\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n\nT\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n\n\n\n\n where 2h is thickness of the asthenospheric channel, \n\u03b1\n=\n3.28\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n is thermal expansion coefficient, and \n\n\nT\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n=\n1400\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC is ambient temperature of the plume (Appendix; Rudge et al., 2008). Tomographic models suggest that \n2\nh\n=\n150\n\u00b1\n50\n km (Schoonman et al., 2017). The amplitude of uplift recorded by a landscape yields an estimate of \u0394T (Fig. 6\nc). From Equation (1), we obtain \u0394T values of \n\n\n33\n\n\n\u2212\n8\n\n\n+\n16\n\n\n, \n\n\n80\n\n\n\u2212\n20\n\n\n+\n40\n\n\n, \n\n\n21\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n+\n10\n\n\n and \n\n\n21\n\n\n\u2212\n5\n\n\n+\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC for landscapes Q, R, S and T, respectively. Landscape P has a \u0394T value of \n\n\n30\n\n\n\u2212\n7\n\n\n+\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC.\nThree of these estimates are consistent with the results of Parnell-Turner et al. (2014), who analyzed Neogene V-shaped ridges and obtained temperature fluctuations of 25\u201330\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\nC that varied on timescales of 3\u20138 Myrs. The obvious exception is the \u0394T value for Landscape R, which predates V-shaped ridge activity and reflects an earlier hotter stage of the Icelandic plume (White and McKenzie, 1989). The timings of transient landscape development also align with peaks of magmatism (Fig. 6b and c). Recurrence of these transient landscapes gives rise to discrete phases of denudation and submarine fan deposition (White and Lovell, 1997). Here, episodes of fan deposition described by Neal (1996) have been calibrated with the astronomical timescale (Appendix; Speijer et al., 2020). There is a close relationship between timing of these clastic deposits, magmatic peaks, volcanic tuff deposits, and landscapes (Fig. 6c). For example, landscapes P and Q coincide with deposition of the Maureen and Lower Balmoral fans while landscapes R and T coincide with the Forties and Lower Frigg fans. In each case, the scales of regional uplift and of fan volume are proportional. Fan deposition is absent at distal boreholes of the Faroe-Shetland basin, where sedimentation is dominated by mudstones, which exhibit discrete spikes of gamma ray intensity that are coeval with individual landscapes (Appendix). If sedimentary composition is relatively uniform, these spikes may be indicative of a relative increase in terrestrially sourced material enriched by radioactive elements or of an organic bloom generated by enhanced erosion and delivery of nutrients. Another well-known mechanism that can trigger such spikes is an increase in carbonate dissolution triggered by a reduction in the carbonate saturation state through the rapid addition of CO2.\n\n\n3.2\nPlume activity and climatic aberrations\nWe now consider the relationship between buried landscapes, mantle plume behavior and global climatic aberrations. The Paleogene period is characterized by climatic perturbations known as hyperthermal events that are superimposed upon a longer term oscillation of cooling and warming (Fig. 6a; Zachos et al., 2001). The most pronounced event is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which occurs at \n55.9\n\u00b1\n0.1\n Myrs. Other significant events include the Danian\/Selandian Transition Event (STE at \n61.3\n\u00b1\n0.15\n Myrs), the Early Late Paleocene Event (ELPE at \n59.25\n\u00b1\n0.1\n Myrs) and two Eocene Thermal Maximum events (ETM2 and ETM3 at \n53.9\n\u00b1\n0.05\n Myrs and \n52.85\n\u00b1\n0.08\n Myrs, respectively; Barnet et al., 2019). These aberrations are manifest as global perturbations of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC and of Fe intensity, which is diagnostic of increased clay fraction as a consequence of enhanced carbonate dissolution (R\u00f6hl et al., 2003; Fig. 6a). At ODP borehole 1262, spikes of Fe intensity, \n\n\nI\n\n\nF\ne\n\n\n, and of gamma ray intensity, \n\n\nI\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n, linearly correlate with a coefficient of determination of \n\n\nR\n\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0.96\n such that \n\n\nI\n\n\nF\ne\n\n\n=\n413\n\n\nI\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n. These spikes coincide with negative marine excursions of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC that are up to 2.5\u2030, although excursions of up to 8\u2030 have been recorded by other ancient archives (see Table 1 of McInerney and Wing, 2011).\nOsmium isotopic records, mercury concentrations and radiometrically dated volcanic rocks from the continental fringes of the North Atlantic Ocean reveal an excellent temporal coherence between the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) and the PETM event (Storey et al., 2007; Dickson et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2019a). This coherence suggests that basaltic magmatism, generated by fluctuations of the Icelandic plume, is a trigger for significant addition of 13C-depleted carbon to surficial reservoirs during the PETM event. However, the composition and origin of carbon species is much debated. We note that the volume of magmatism associated with the NAIP is sufficient to account for the volume of carbon but that positive feedback effects can also amplify climatic change (Gutjahr et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2019b). Analysis of an inventory of hydrothermal vents along the Norwegian continental margin suggests that methane generated by contact metamorphism could have been a primary source of carbon (Svensen et al., 2004; Frieling et al., 2016). Regional uplift and disruption to oceanic circulation could also be associated with methane release triggered by dissociation of gas hydrate deposits (Bice and Marotzke, 2002).\nReconciling the short (i.e. \u223c200 ka) duration of the PETM event with the duration of NAIP volcanism is regarded as challenging (Storey et al., 2007). It is straightforward to estimate the transit time of a thermal fluctuation that horizontally advects beneath a lithospheric plate by considering what happens when a V-shaped ridge forms at a mid-oceanic ridge. At the present day, the axial length of the actively forming V-shaped ridge is \n100\n\u00b1\n50\n km (Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). The geometry of this migrating V-shaped ridge shows that the thermal fluctuation travels at a speed of \n282\n\u00b1\n24\n km\/Myr, yielding a duration of \n350\n\u00b1\n180\n ka. Indirect evidence suggests that Paleogene thermal fluctuations traveled at greater speeds of up to 500 km\/Myr (Rudge et al., 2008). We conclude that transient uplift events of sufficiently short duration can easily be generated by time-dependent mantle processes. Emission-based modeling of NAIP activity implies that it is capable of generating appropriate volumes of greenhouse gases on timescales of O(100) ka (Jones et al., 2019b).\nDespite compelling evidence that the NAIP played a significant role in triggering the PETM event, volcanic events have not previously been invoked for other Paleogene hyperthermal aberrations. A probability density function of primarily 40Ar\/39Ar dates shows that there is a clear temporal correlation between NAIP magmatic activity, initiation of buried landscapes and perturbations of both stable isotopic and Fe intensity records (Wilkinson et al., 2017). Warm climatic excursions triggered by glacio-eustatic fluctuations cannot account for these observations since this association is not logically compatible with the relative sea-level falls required to generate emergent landscapes. Instead, borehole records confirm a temporal link between episodes of regional uplift and hyperthermal aberrations (Fig. 6a and d). For example, peak intensities of Fe and gamma ray records for hyperthermal events at ODP site 1262 coincide with, and are proportional to, landscape relief (Fig. 7\nd and e). A useful proxy for the size of a hyperthermal event is the carbon isotope excursion, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\ni\n, that is used to estimate the mass of added carbon, M, where\n\n(2)\n\nM\n=\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nf\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC is the carbon isotopic ratio of each pool where subscripts \ni\n=\ninitial\n, + = added, and f = final (McInerney and Wing, 2011). The initial mass of carbon, \n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n=\n5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n Pg, and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n\n\n=\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\u223c\n1\n\u2030 (Fig. 6a). The value of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC+ varies between \u22126.6\u2030 and \u221217\u2030 with an average value of \u221211\u2030 (Gutjahr et al., 2017). Given that mantle-derived carbon has a \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC value of about \u22126\u2030, a composite carbon source is required. Methane is probably a significant contributor that could have been generated by melting of clathrate deposits or by contact metamorphism adjacent to hydrothermal vents (Svensen et al., 2004). We estimate M for the five hyperthermal events by assuming that \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u2212\n6.0\n\n\n+\n4.4\n\n\n\u2030. For the PETM and ETM2 events, we obtain values of \n\n\n1.01\n\n\n\u2212\n0.34\n\n\n+\n0.59\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n Pg and \n\n\n5.34\n\n\n\u2212\n1.86\n\n\n+\n3.43\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n Pg, respectively. These values are consistent with independent estimates of \n1.02\n\u00b1\n0.2\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n Pg and \n3.2\n\u00b1\n0.6\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n for the PETM and ETM2 events, respectively (Gutjahr et al., 2017; Harper et al., 2020). With the exception of the ELPE event, which in marine records is characterized by minor excursions of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC, landscape relief is proportional to added mass of carbon (Fig. 7d and e). Onshore records show that the ELPE event is often characterized by a more significant excursion of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC (Coccioni et al., 2019). Our results suggest that at least some hyperthermal events are associated with, and probably triggered by, transient plume activity. We propose that pulses of basaltic volcanism serve both as sources of CO2 and as triggers for methane release.\n\n\n3.3\nLong-period oscillation\nThe best-known hyperthermal events clearly fall within a long period oscillation of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values (Fig. 7a). This oscillation starts with a positive excursion, which has a peak value of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC = +2.4\u2030 at 58 Myrs, and ends with a negative excursion, which has a peak value of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n=\n\u2212\n0.3\n\u2030 at 53.5 Myrs. We model the oscillation using a mass balance equation, based upon the combined production and decay of silicate weathering and volcanic outgassing, so that\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\n(\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ni\n\n\n+\n\n\nc\n\n\nv\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nv\n\n\n+\n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\nM\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n In this equation, \n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n and \nM\n(\nt\n)\n are initial and remaining masses of carbon within the surface reservoir where \n\n\nM\n\n\ni\n\n\n is assumed to be \n5\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n Pg (McInerney and Wing, 2011). \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\ni\n, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\nv\n and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC\ns\n are values of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC for the initial surface reservoir, for volcanic outgassing, and for silicate weathering, respectively (Table 1\n). \n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n(\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\ns\n\n\nc\n(\nt\n)\n and \n\n\nc\n\n\nv\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n(\n\u03c3\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nv\n\n\nc\n(\nt\n)\n are carbon contributions to the surface reservoir as a function of time for silicate weathering and volcanic outgassing, respectively. \n\n\nF\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\nF\n\n\nv\n\n\n are appropriate scaling factors of opposite sign. The functions \n\n\nc\n\n\ns\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n and \n\n\nc\n\n\nv\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n are derived in the Appendix.\nAn important assumption of this calculation is that peak production of silicate weathering and of volcanism are temporally displaced (Fig. 7b). This assumption is justified by two significant observations. The first phase of plume-related magmatism is focused beneath the British Isles and beneath Greenland between 64 and 57 Myrs (White and McKenzie, 1989). During this phase, regional uplift generated by large-scale magmatic underplating caused widespread regional erosion (White and Lovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002). The resultant surge of silicate weathering was accompanied by minimal volcanic outgassing and triggered a global drawdown of carbon that generated a positive excursion of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC. This drawdown could have been amplified by enhanced burial of organic matter. The second phase of magmatism is almost exclusively focused along the axis of plate separation, which had two significant consequences\u2014 melt production rate increased by several orders of magnitude as a result of rapid adiabatic decompression and regional uplift was negligible as a result of lithospheric thinning and oceanic plate formation (Storey et al., 2007). The consequent volcanic outgassing was accompanied by negligible regional erosion and triggered a negative excursion of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC.\nTo fit the positive excursion of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC, \n\n\nF\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n1.15\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n Pg and \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n=\n0.727\n Myr\u22121. Significantly, this value of \n\n\nF\n\n\ns\n\n\n is consistent with \n\n\n0.78\n\n\n\u2212\n0.3\n\n\n+\n0.34\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n Pg obtained by assuming 3\u2013\n6\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n km3 of siliciclastic sediment with a density of 2.65 \u00b1 0.2 Mgm\u22123, was weathered from the continents and deposited offshore (Jones et al., 2002). We also assume that 1 mole of carbon is sequestered for every mole of silicate mineral that is weathered. One consequence of large volumes of carbon being sequestered is a \u223c50% loss from the surface reservoir, in agreement with studies suggesting that there was a \u223c50% drop in atmospheric CO2 between 60 and 55 Myrs (Beerling and Royer, 2011). The value of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n implies it would take more than 1 Myr to replace carbon sequestered by silicate weathering, an order of magnitude greater than modern estimates (Hilton and West, 2020).\nTo fit the negative excursion of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC, \n\n\nF\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\n8.38\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n Pg and \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nv\n\n\n=\n0.288\n Myr\u22121. This value of \n\n\nF\n\n\nv\n\n\n is consistent with an estimate of \n\n\n9.5\n\n\n\u2212\n2.3\n\n\n+\n2.5\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n Pg obtained from the volume of extrusive magmatism seismically imaged along the margins of the North Atlantic Ocean (White and McKenzie, 1989; White et al., 2008). The erupted volume over a period of \u223c2 Myrs is typically \n380\n\u00b1\n20\n km2 per kilometer, which is distributed along both margins over a strike length of 2500 km. These values yield an extrusive melting rate of \n0.95\n\u00b1\n0.05\n km3 a\u22121 at 55.0 Myrs, which is slightly less than that obtained by Storey et al. (2007). We assume that volcanic degassing from extrusive magmas emits \n5\n\u00b1\n1\n kgm\u22123 (Gutjahr et al., 2017). The value of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nv\n\n\n implies that it would take more than 1 Myr to remove emitted carbon from the ocean-atmosphere system. Independent estimates of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nv\n\n\n range from 2 to 5 Myr\u22121 (Colbourn et al., 2015). Note that at the peak of silicate weathering, we assume that the extrusive melting rate is one order of magnitude smaller. This assumption is in accordance with an average extrusive melting rate of \u223c0.05 km3 a\u22121 estimated from the spatial distribution of basaltic rocks on the British Isles and Greenland (White and McKenzie, 1989).\nWe acknowledge that this calculation is speculative and is predicated upon small values of \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\ns\n\n\n and \n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\nv\n\n\n (Fig. 7c). Nevertheless, the resultant fit between observed and calculated oscillation is compelling (Fig. 7a). It implies that plume-related silicate weathering and volcanic outgassing act to moderate \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n13\n\n\nC values between 64 and 48 Myrs.\n\n\n\n4\nConclusions\nThere is considerable interest in developing a quantitative understanding of rapid climatic changes within the geologic record. In recent decades, this understanding has been predicated upon the astronomical framework of orbital cyclicity. However, there are notable aberrations and exceptional trends that cannot easily be accounted for by this framework. During Paleogene times, for example, global hyperthermal events that are superimposed upon a longer period climatic oscillation occur, neither of which have obvious explanations. These events are of particular importance because they are regarded as ancient analogues of present-day climate change. One of the best known is the PETM event, which represents \n\u223c\n5\n\n\n\n\n\u2218\n\n\n C of global warming with an associated carbon release of up to \n1.3\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n Pg over \n2\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n\n4\n\n\n years (McInerney and Wing, 2011).\nMantle convective processes and volcanism are often proposed as significant potential contributors to Earth surface processes and to climate change. However, there is a general perception that these mechanisms occur on timescales that are too slow to account for events on time scales of O(100) kyr. The observations that we present here should help to overturn this perception. Throughout the North Atlantic region, there is evidence for repeated transient vertical displacements of the Earth's surface that cannot be accounted for by glacio-eustatic mechanisms. These displacements are indirectly recorded as buried ephemeral landscapes. The best-preserved landscapes share common attributes with hyperthermal events\u2014 they occur at the same times, they are geologically rapid, and they coincide with excursions of gamma ray intensity. We infer that thermal fluctuations of the Icelandic mantle plume played a role in triggering some of these hyperthermal events. Several of these events are characterized by double-spiked excursions which may be hallmarks either of eccentric forcing or of staged uplift events for which there is independent geologic evidence (Hartley et al., 2011).\nOur results have far-reaching implications. The Milankovitch hypothesis has, for excellent reasons, provided a superb quantitative framework for interpreting stratigraphic and isotopic records. However, it is becoming clear that tectonic events driven by mantle convective dynamics can intrude upon this rhythmic tempo. The best-known hyperthermal events appear to fall within a long-period climatic oscillation which may itself have been triggered by the two-stage evolution of the Icelandic plume which could have enhanced sensitivity to orbital forcing. The events themselves coincide with, and can be at least partly explained by, episodes of transient landscape development that are linked with short-period fluctuations in plume activity. In conclusion, we suggest that a detailed and integrated multi-disciplinary analysis of the Icelandic plume across a range of spatial and temporal scales should bear fruitful paleoclimatic insights.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nBenedict Conway-Jones: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Writing.

Most data consist of major, trace and volatile elements. Studies reporting stable and radiogenic isotopes measured in melt inclusions are rare (e.g., Koornneef et al., 2019; Maclennan, 2008; Rose-Koga et al., 2012; Saal et al., 2002; Stracke et al., 2019), with only nine reporting oxygen isotopes (Bouvier et al., 2008, 2010, 2019; Gurenko et al., 2001; Gurenko and Chaussidon, 2002; Hartley et al., 2012, 2013; Manzini et al., 2019). Only Manzini et al. (2019) and Gurenko and Chaussidon (2002) report \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in OHMIs and their host olivine. Gurenko and Chaussidon (2002) report that most OHMIs in their Icelandic samples are in O isotopic equilibrium with their hosts. On the contrary, Manzini et al. (2019) show that up to 54% of 32 OHMIs analyzed from an E-MORB sample, and 58% of 21 OHMIs from an N-MORB sample, both from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, are not in isotopic equilibrium with their host. The range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in OHMIs within a single sample reaches 2.6\u2030, which is far wider than the range measured by laser fluorination in fresh MORB glass (0.5\u2030; Eiler et al., 2000b) and greater than the SIMS analytical precision (0.3\u2030, 2 standard deviation, 2SD). The processes that generate the disequilibrium are not yet understood, leading Manzini et al. (2019) to suggest \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO data in OHMIs, at least from MORB settings, should be interpreted with caution.\nIn this study, we present new \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO data for olivine crystals from arc settings that contain OHMIs for which \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n37\n\n\nCl have already been measured (Bouvier et al., 2019). Investigating whether or not the O isotopes in the OHMIs are in equilibrium with O isotopes in their host crystals could help understand the large O isotopic variability that has been measured in OHMIs from a single sample (Bouvier et al., 2019; Manzini et al., 2019). The results, coupled with new trace elements in the OHMIs and their hosts, suggest that a large proportion of the OHMIs analyzed were trapped within remobilized, cumulate olivines. Oxygen isotopes in OHMIs and their host olivine, in addition to being a useful tracer of slab fluids, could give valuable insights into OHMI formation, crystal history and possibly the magmatic plumbing system in which they formed.\n\n\n2\nSamples\nSelected samples were collected from Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy), St. Vincent (Lesser Antilles arc), Iwate Volcano (NE Japan arc), Sukumoyama (Izu-Bonin arc) and Aoba (Vanuatu arc) (Bouvier et al., 2019; Manzini et al., 2017a; Nichols et al., 2012; Rose-Koga et al., 2014). They contain naturally glassy OHMIs that had already been analyzed for major elements, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO, as well as \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n11\n\n\nB and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n37\n\n\nCl (Bouvier et al., 2019). The OHMIs are basaltic in composition. Their major elements are in equilibrium with those of their host olivine, as reflected by the small amounts of correction for post-entrapment crystallization (mostly <10%; Supplementary Material 1A-B, calculated using Petrolog software; Danyushevsky and Plechov, 2011). Oxygen isotopes in OHMIs (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI) measured in Vulcano and St. Vincent fall within the range of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO bulk rock values measured in basaltic samples from the literature for Vulcano and Southern Lesser Antilles arc (Fig. 1\n; Supplementary Material 2). \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI from Iwate are mostly lower than the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO for bulk rocks from neighbouring volcanic centers, whereas for Sukumoyama \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI are mostly higher than in the bulk rocks. No bulk rock \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO are available for Aoba or from elsewhere along the Vanuatu arc front.\n\n\n3\nAnalytical techniques\n\n3.1\nSIMS\nOxygen isotopes in olivines have been measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) on a IMS 1280HR at the University of Lausanne, following the same protocol as Manzini et al. (2019) during two separate sessions (September 2018 and September 2019). In brief, a 2nA primary Cs+ beam was focused on the sample, and secondary 16O and 18O ions were measured on faraday cups in multicollection mode, using a 2460 mass resolution (M\/\u0394M). A 30 sec pre-sputtering was set at the beginning of each analysis, and total acquisition time was almost 4 minutes per analysis. Four in-house olivine standards were used to calculate the instrumental mass fractionation as a function of Fo (Mg\/(Fe+Mg) mole ratio) content (Supplementary Material 3). The San Carlos olivine in-house standard (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO = 5.2 \u00b1 0.12\u2030) was measured repeatedly during the session in order to monitor any potential instrumental instability. The repeatability of measurements of the San Carlos olivine standard was 0.37\u2030 during the first SIMS session and better than 0.30\u2030 during the second (2 standard deviation, 2SD), which is slightly greater than the statistical error associated with each analysis of the sample olivines (2 standard errors, 2SE). Uncertainty, based on the deviation of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO measured on the San Carlos olivine and the theoretical values of the San Carlos olivine defined by the calibration curve, is 0.4\u2030 (2SD).\n\n\n3.2\nEMPA\nMajor elements have been measured in olivine close to each of the spots analyzed for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO by electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) using a JEOL 8200 Superprobe at the University of Lausanne. Conditions were set at 15 kV, 15 nA, using a focused beam of 1 \u03bcm. Peak measurement times for Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni were each 30 sec, and 20 sec for Na. Backgrounds were measured for 15 sec. The different elements were standardized using different in-house minerals: fayalite for Si and Fe, forsterite for Mg, wollastonite for CaO, andalusite for Al, rutile for Ti, chromite for Cr, nickel oxide for Ni, tephroite for Mn and albite for Na.\nX-rays distribution maps of seven olivines from different samples were acquired using the same electron microprobe. Analytical conditions were 15 kV, 10 nA, with a beam diameter of \u22641 \u03bcm and 200 ms dwell-time with a 2 \u03bcm pixel size for P, Al and Fe.\n\n\n3.3\nLA-ICP-MS\nLaser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses were performed using an Australian Scientific Instruments RESOlution 193 nm ArF excimer laser (including a dual volume sample holder) coupled to a Thermo Element XR sector field ICP-MS via He-Ar carrier gas, at the University of Lausanne. The laser diameter on the sample was 30 or 50 \u03bcm (for analysis of olivines) to 10 or 20 \u03bcm (for analysis of OHMIs) depending on the size of the MI or available area in the olivine. The repetition rate of the laser was 12 Hz. Elements were measured in the sample for 25 sec, with a fluence of 8 sec. The background was measured before and after the sample for 30 sec. NIST 612 was used as a primary standard, and GOR132 and BHVO were used as secondary standards (Jochum et al., 2006, 2005). Repeatability of all elements on NIST 612 was better than 2% (2SD) over 22 measurements. Uncertainty on the secondary standard varied from 10% (2SD) for the light trace elements up to 28% (2SD) for the heavy trace elements. The data were processed using Iolite software (Paton et al., 2011).\n\n\n3.4\nCO2-fluorination\nOxygen isotopes were measured at the stable isotope laboratory of the University of Lausanne (Switzerland) using the CO2 laser fluorination method described in Lacroix and Vennemann (2015). Several analyses of approximately 0.5 \u2013 2 mg were made on four olivines. The samples were pre-fluorinated overnight (min. 10 \u2013 12 h) and subsequently lasered in the presence of about 50 mbar of ultrapure F2 using a CO2-laser. The extracted O2 was purified cryogenically and passed over heated KCl salt. Finally oxygen was absorbed onto a 5 \u00c5 molecular sieve and cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The O2 was then analysed with a Thermo Finningan MAT 253 mass spectrometer. All results are corrected to the NBS-28 quartz standard (9.64\u2030; Sharp, 1990) and expressed relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water. Replicate oxygen isotope analyses of NBS-28 quartz have an average precision of \u00b10.04\u2030.\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nOlivine major elements compositions\nThe olivines have forsterite contents (Fo = 100 x Mg\/(Fe+Mg)) ranging from 75 to 91. In detail, olivines from Iwate, Sukumoyama and Vulcano have a narrow range of Fo (<5% at each center), whereas Aoba and St. Vincent olivines have more variable Fo (>10%; Table 1\n). Each sample contains at least one olivine without any apparent Fo zoning. The other olivines display either normal or reverse zoning (Table 1). Three olivines from St. Vincent and one from Aoba display a more complex zoning (core, mantle and rim with non-linear variations in Fo; Supplementary Material 4).\n\n\n4.2\nOlivine \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO compositions\nAt least two \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO measurements were made 10-20 \u03bcm away from each OHMI in each olivine (\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl), in addition to one in the center of the grain and one at the rim, when a rim was identifiable. In some olivines, spots were also analysed in random locations or as profiles. Results are presented in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Material 5a. Results from the two SIMS sessions give consistent results: of the 11 olivines measured in both sessions, only three have average \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO that differ by more than 0.4\u2030 between both sessions (Supplementary Material 5a). For Aoba_3-10-17-h3 and Aoba_15-1 (Aoba sample (Vanuatu arc), Supplementary Material 6-7), the difference is due to a higher number of olivine analyses revealing heterogeneity in the crystals during the second session. For SVN181 (St. Vincent sample (Lesser Antilles arc), Supplementary Material 4), the reason for the statistically different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO between the two sessions is unclear.\nMost of the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO(Ol) values measured in this study are between 4.6 and 6.7\u2030, with the average for each olivine varying from 4.1 to 6.5\u2030 (Table 1), which slightly extends the range of bulk \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO(Ol) from the literature (e.g., Dorendorf et al., 2000; Eiler et al., 2000a; Fig. 2\n) covering a wider range than is typical for bulk olivine from peridotite (+5.2\u00b10.2\u2030; Mattey et al., 1994). In detail, individual SIMS analyses return values ranging from 2.8 to 7.4\u2030.\nInterestingly, within a sample, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI variation is not systematically linked with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl variation (i.e., for a given sample, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl can vary more or less than \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI; Fig. 1). Overall and within a sample, there is no correlation between \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl and Fo content of the olivine (Fig. 3\n). Olivines exhibit varying degrees of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl heterogeneity, with 2SD larger than the 2SD of the reference material (Table 1). Only for Vulcano are all the measured olivines homogeneous (2SD <0.5\u2030; Table 1). For St. Vincent, Aoba and Sukumoyama, olivines are both homogeneous and heterogeneous, with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl in the rim higher or lower than that in the core (Table 1). For Iwate, two olivines have higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl in the rim, the remaining are homogeneous (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl >6.5\u2030 (18 data) were mostly measured in rims or close to OHMIs and embayments. Aoba_3 has the most olivines with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl >6.5\u2030 and the highest average \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl, as well as relatively low Fo content (76.8 \u2013 85.9; Table 1) and no bulk rock data. In order to verify these high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl, four measurements of bulk olivines by CO2 laser fluorination were made in olivines from sample Aoba_3 to supplement the SIMS measurements of the olivines. The measured bulk \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl values are similar to the average \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl measured by SIMS in Aoba_3 (average of 6.2\u2030), but less variable (5.9 \u2013 6.1\u2030 in bulk compared to 4.9 \u2013 7.0\u2030 by SIMS, Fig. 1; Table 2\n).\nThe most surprising results came from olivine crystal Aoba_3-10-17-h3 which has the most variable \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (2.2\u2030, 2SD, n = 22), with systematically low values down to 2.4\u2030. Potential matrix or topography effects were ruled out (Supplementary Material 6). To our knowledge, such low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values (< 4\u2030) in olivine have only been reported in ocean island basalts from Mauna Kea (Hawaii; Eiler et al., 2011) and Iceland (e.g., Bindeman et al., 2008, 2006; Eiler et al., 2011; Maclennan et al., 2003), but not yet for arc samples.\n\n\n4.3\nOlivine and melt inclusions trace element compositions\nThe OHMIs from the five studied arcs are all enriched in fluid mobiles elements (Ba, Pb, Sr) compared to average MORB (Hofmann, 1988), with the strongest enrichment recorded in OHMIs from Vulcano and the weakest enrichment in OHMIs from Iwate (Supplementary Material 1c).\nThe olivines contain <1 ppm REEs, Sr, Y, Nb and Ba, as expected. Most olivines contain a few ppm (1 \u2013 100 ppm) of P and V. Al, Cr and Ni are the most abundant trace elements in the olivines, with up to 400 ppm Al and Cr, and up to 2800 ppm Ni. Olivines from Aoba and Iwate are more enriched in trace elements compared to olivines from St. Vincent, Vulcano and Sukumoyama. All trace element data are in Supplementary Material 1a and 5b.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nThe magmatic history of the olivines\nThe olivines in this study do not have high enough Fo (>90) and NiO (>0.3 wt%), and low enough CaO (<0.1 wt%) to have originated in the mantle, suggesting a magmatic origin (Fig. 3b-c). The distribution of olivine compositions can be defined by three end-members: 1) Fo \u223c90, high NiO (>0.3 wt%) and low CaO (\u223c0.12 wt%); 2) Fo \u223c90, CaO >0.4 wt% but low NiO (0.10 wt%); and 3) low Fo, CaO \u223c0.12 wt% and low NiO (0.04 wt%). Endmember (1) reflects olivine crystallised from a melt derived from mantle peridotite, whereas (3) represents olivine crystallised from an evolved melt derived from the mantle. The second primitive component (2), defined by olivines from Vulcano, represents olivine that has crystallised from ultra-calcic, alkali-rich melts. These melts are interpreted to result from the reaction between hot primitive melts and wehrlitic or gabbroic lithologies at 250 to 350 MPa (Lanzo et al., 2016). Olivines from Aoba seem to form two groups, resulting from mixing between end members (2) and (3). The contribution of both clinopyroxenite and peridotite to the melts beneath Aoba is also reported by Sorbadere et al. (2011).\nThe variation in Fo content in each olivine crystal provides valuable information on magmatic processes. Normal zoning (a rim with lower Fo) is likely to represent magmatic evolution or magma mixing with a more evolved melt, whereas reverse zoning strongly suggests that the olivine has grown in two different melt compositions, with the second one being more primitive than the melt in which the olivine started growing. These Fo variations can only be preserved if the olivine residence time at high temperature is short (e.g., several years, Costa et al., 2008). All five olivines from Vulcano have homogeneous Fo (intra-grain and grain-to-grain), which either suggests a long residence time that erases Fo zoning or formation of the olivine in a primitive melt with no magma mixing until eruption. Iwate and Sukumoyama olivines have different magmatic histories, reflected by the different types of zoning (reverse or normal). Aoba and St. Vincent olivines are either unzoned or have normal zoning (Table 1), suggesting that some of the olivine retain a record of magmatic evolution. Olivines from Aoba and St. Vincent also display complex zoning, suggesting at least three different magmatic steps.\nFo zoning is not necessarily correlated with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning in olivine (Table 1). This could be explained by the faster interdiffusion of Fe-Mg (e.g., Gaetani and Watson, 2002; Jurewicz and Watson, 1988) in olivine compared to O diffusion at 1250\u00b0C (Dohmen et al., 2002), which could lead to a \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning without Fo zoning. This is possibly recorded in olivines SVN_MM1 from St. Vincent, Izu_6 from Sukumoyama and Iwate_10 from Iwate, for which the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning suggest magma mixing, but the absence of Fo zoning either suggests a long residence time or mixing with a melt that has different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO but a similar major element composition. Other olivines have normal Fo zoning, without \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning, which can simply be the result of magmatic evolution. Indeed, closed system igneous differentiation is suggested to increase \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO up to 0.5\u2030 in the melt for the range of compositions exhibited by the OHMIs (SiO2 ranging from 44 to 52 wt%), and thus in the crystallizing olivine (e.g., Bindeman, 2008; Bucholz et al., 2017). This could be the case for olivines SVN168, SVN_MM7, both from St. Vincent, Aoba_15-1 from Aoba, Izu_1 from Sukumoyama, Iwate_1 and Iwate_14, both from Iwate. Of all the olivines analysed, only one (Iwate_5 from Iwate) with reverse Fo zoning has no \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning, which cannot result from magmatic differentiation. Instead, it could have resulted from mixing between magmas with similar \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO. Many olivines have preserved normal or reverse zoning as well as \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO zoning (two olivines from St. Vincent, SVN171, SVN181; three from Aoba, Aoba_3-4, Aoba_3-5, Aoba_17-10; three from Sukumoyama, Izu_4, Izu_5, Izu_10; and one from Iwate, Iwate_2) that records magma mixing. In summary, in all samples except those from Vulcano, a few olivines have preserved a record of normal magmatic evolution and most of them record magma mixing.\n\n\n5.2\nSignificance of the extreme \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO values measured in olivines\n\n5.2.1\nOrigin of the low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl\n\nTwenty-one SIMS analyses of olivines have \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl values \u22644.6\u2030; these are the lowest values that have been reported for arc front settings, to date (Fig. 2). These values have been found in seven different olivine crystals, in both cores (e.g., olivines Aoba_3-10-17-h3, Iwate_2, Izu_4, Iwate_10) and rims (e.g., olivines Izu_6 and SVN171). All the \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl analyses \u22644.6\u2030 are associated with olivines that have Fo <84, which is usually interpreted as reflecting crystallization in a melt affected by assimilation of low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO crustal material altered at high temperature (e.g., Genske et al., 2013; Wang and Eiler, 2008). For olivines from Iwate, there is a weak positive relationship between Fo and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl (Fig. 3a), suggesting mixing between a moderately mafic melt (with olivines Fo80) with mantle-like \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO, and a more evolved (leading to olivine Fo75) melt with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO \u223c4.5\u2030. On the contrary, for olivines from Aoba, Sukumoyama and St. Vincent, no correlation is observed between Fo and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl, suggesting that for those volcanoes the volume of low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in the system is very small. The olivine crystal Aoba_3-10-17-h3 with the lowest \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl measured in this study (2.4\u2030) has preserved evidence of olivine dissolution, as observed in the zoning of phosphorus (Fig. 4\n). The phosphorus zones are not correlated with Fo zones (Supplementary Material 6), but rather with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO. Indeed, the lowest \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl are measured in the crystal domains with the highest phosphorus (340 ppm, Supplementary Material 5). The correlation between low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl and high phosphorus domains (>1000 ppm) in a Mauna Kea olivine led Eiler et al. (2011) to suggest that oxygen isotope fractionation between olivine and the melt might be affected by the olivine growth rate. The high phosphorus domains, due to diffusion-limited growth, usually have phosphorus content higher than 1000 ppm and are limited to narrow bands of a few microns (e.g., Manzini et al., 2017b; Milman-Barris et al., 2008). However, in the specific case of Aoba_3-10-17-h3, dissolution textures are evident and the high phosphorus zones do not resemble typical diffusion-limited growth. Instead, the high phosphorus zones with low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO reflect olivine that was partially dissolved. Reprecipitated olivine has lower phosphorus (8 ppm, Supplementary Material 5), as observed in other studies (e.g., Manzini et al., 2017b; Milman-Barris et al., 2008) and higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (\u223c5\u2030), reflecting crystallization in a melt with a different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO than the one in which olivine initially grew.\nThe initial low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl values in Aoba3_10-17-h3, in the high phosphorus zone, with a relatively evolved composition (Fo83\u221284), could reflect local mixing with a melt of crust that was hydrothermally altered at high temperature. The presence of a crater lake at Aoba may help fluids circulate locally to great depth (e.g., Warden, 1970), although there are other volcanoes with a crater lake that do not have evidence of low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO melt (e.g., Deegan et al., 2021). The olivine is subsequently remobilized by a melt with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of around 5.2-5.5\u2030 as recorded in the rim and possibly more primitive as recorded in the trapped OHMI. The recrystallized olivine has a mixed \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl composition between the initial low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO and the more mantle-like \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO. This could explain the relatively low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (4.8\u2030), for an island arc setting, of one of the Aoba OHMIs, even though it has typical major and trace element compositions (e.g., Fig. 5\n; Supplementary Material 1), and suggests that this OHMI was trapped during recrystallization of a remobilized olivine. This is the only olivine of the six that were mapped with such features (Supplementary Material 8), and the only crystal of those that have been analysed with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl <4\u2030, suggesting that olivine growth in a low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO melt, possibly reflecting localized crustal assimilation by high temperature fluids, and dissolution-reprecipitation due to remobilization by a more mafic melt is rare.\n\n\n5.2.2\nOrigin of the high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO(Ol)\n\nHigh \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl values (>6.0\u2030) are relatively unusual (e.g., Fig. 2), but have already been reported in olivines from Kamchatka, measured either by CO2 or ArF laser techniques (Auer et al., 2009; Dorendorf et al., 2000; Fig. 2). They are interpreted as resulting from hydrous melt fluxing of mantle wedge peridotite that has interacted with a shallow metasomatized high-\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO lithospheric mantle.\n\nBouvier et al. (2019) suggested that the high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI (>6.5\u2030) preserved in the OHMIs from this study, coupled with low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n37\n\n\nCl (<-1.5\u2030), reflect the imprint of subducted sediments. Indeed, \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of sediments vary from 8 to 30\u2030 (e.g., Bindeman, 2008) and strongly negative \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n37\n\n\nCl are usually attributed to the influence of sediments (e.g., Barnes and Sharp, 2017). Sediment influence beneath St. Vincent, Aoba, Vulcano, Iwate and Sukumoyama has also been proposed by other studies based on traces elements and\/or stable isotopes (e.g., Bouvier et al., 2008; Manzini et al., 2017a; M\u00e9trich and Deloule, 2014; Nichols et al., 2012; Peccerillo et al., 2013; Rose-Koga et al., 2014).\nFractionation of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO at high temperature (>500\u00b0C) is relatively small in silicate minerals (<2\u2030, Zheng et al., 1999), so it is estimated that the bulk sediment melt and aqueous fluids have similar \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO. The nature of the sediment component (aqueous vs. melt-like fluid) could not be determined based solely on the isotopic data. Trace elements ratios can help identifying the nature of the fluids, for example using fluid tracers, such as Ba\/La (Ba being a fluid mobile element), or the ratio of fluid immobile elements, such as La\/Yb. Ba\/La in the studied samples show that their primitive melts have been modified by an aqueous fluid addition, as all OHMIs have higher Ba\/La than MORB (Fig. 5a). La\/Yb can be affected by different degrees of melting, the nature of the mantle source (e.g., garnet or spinel lherzolite) and input of hydrous melt from sediments. \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOMI and Ba\/La do not correlate within each sample (Fig. 5a), but the relatively stable La\/Yb ratios, similar to MORB, for St. Vincent, Iwate and Sukumoyama strongly suggest that the sediment contribution is made via aqueous fluids at these volcanoes (Fig. 5b). On the contrary, Aoba and especially Vulcano both have higher Ba\/La than MORB but also significantly higher La\/Yb. Different degrees of melting of a mantle source alone cannot explain the La\/Yb variations for Aoba and Vulcano, but instead suggest that the sediment imprint originates from a hydrous melt-like component at these two volcanoes. Thus high \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl (>6.0\u2030) measured in the samples from this study record a contribution from the slab to the mantle melting, possibly in the form of a hydrous melt of the sediment.\n\n\n\n5.3\nOxygen isotope disequilibrium between melt inclusions and their host olivine\nFirst, it has to be noted that equilibrium fractionation of MORB (\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI = \u22120.58\u2030 at 1250\u00b0C) or alkali basalts (\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI = \u22120.44\u2030 at 1250\u00b0C), both calculated based on the equation \n1000\nln\n\u2061\n\u03b1\n = 106A\/T2, with A coefficient for olivine-melt from Matthews et al. (1998), cannot be distinguished by individual SIMS measurements (accuracy of 0.4\u2030). These calculated values are close to \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI values measured, for example, by Eiler (2001) or Gurenko and Chaussidon (2002). Similarly, a difference in temperature from 1300 to 1000\u00b0C during crystal growth would lead to less than 0.3\u2030 variation in \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (e.g., Bindeman, 2008; Eiler, 2001), which is also unresolvable by SIMS. A large proportion of the olivine-OHMI pairs significantly deviate from the theoretical equilibrium for \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO (> 0.5\u2030, Fig. 6\n). The measured \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI span a large range, from \u22123.8 to +1.4\u2030 (Fig. 7\n). The disequilibrium between the olivine and OHMIs is not linked to the composition of the olivine, as no relationship could be seen between \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI and Fo% (Fig. 7). This excludes any potential analytical artefacts or potential effects on oxygen isotopes during magmatic evolution. Oxygen isotope values in all six OHMIs from Vulcano are in disequilibrium with their host, whereas for St. Vincent, Aoba, Iwate and Sukumoyama variable proportions (46% of 21, 79% of 13, 63% of four and 17% of seven, respectively) of the OHMIs are in equilibrium with their host (Fig. 7). Most \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI for Aoba and St. Vincent and two from Iwate are >0, which is not permitted by the equilibrium equation.\nOxygen isotopic disequilibrium between OHMIs and their host could theoretically result from O diffusion during or after entrapment. As oxygen diffuses slowly in silicate melts (Lesher et al., 1996), with 16O diffusing faster than 18O (Lesher, 2010), the formation of a boundary layer could lead to higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in the remaining (shrinking) OHMIs compared to the melt in which the host crystal is growing. Boundary layer effects should thus shift \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI towards lower values compared to equilibrium. In fact, all Vulcano OHMIs have \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI much lower than equilibrium (lower than \u22122.4\u2030; instead of between \u22120.5\u2030 and \u22120.44\u2030, at equilibrium) due to higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of the MI. But if the development of boundary layers affected the Vulcano OHMI compositions, partitioning of slow diffusing incompatible elements such as phosphorus and Y between the OHMIs and their host should be far higher in Vulcano OHMIs than in the OHMIs from the other volcanoes. However, Vulcano OHMIs have similar partition coefficients (\n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n) for phosphorus and Y compared to other OHMIs (Supplementary Material 1a). Also, for St. Vincent and Aoba OHMIs, for which \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI are both higher and lower than equilibrium, there is no correlation between \n\n\nK\n\n\nd\n\n\n of incompatible elements and \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI, suggesting that the lower \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI do not result from a boundary layer effect in these samples. Similarly, the lack of a correlation between the size of the OHMIs and the ratio of incompatible elements with very different diffusion rates, such as K2O\/TiO2 (e.g., Kress and Ghiorso, 1995), confirms the absence of a boundary layer (Supplementary Material 1d).\nOxygen diffusion from the OHMI to the host olivine after entrapment should lead to higher \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in the OHMI and lower \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO in the surrounding olivine. This might also result in a lower \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI compared to equilibrium. Because oxygen is a slow diffuser (Lesher et al., 1996) and the olivine and melt contain similar amounts of O, diffusion of O along a chemical gradient should be negligible. Thus, neither boundary layer effects nor post-entrapment O diffusion could explain the \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI >0 values.\nDisequilibrium could be explained if an olivine trapped a different melt than the one in which it initially grew. This could happen during magma mixing and olivine remobilization. These scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 8\n. Initially, an olivine crystallizes deep in the magmatic plumbing system, trapping melt inclusions (Fig. 8B). During ascent, the olivine enters the upper lens. Partial dissolution of the crystal edges will create reentrants in the olivine filled by a melt that is a mixture of the lower lens and upper lens melts, or only the upper lens melt if olivine has started to partially dissolve during ascent. The olivine resumes its growth, trapping a melt inclusion with different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO than the first melt inclusions (Fig. 8B). In the second scenario (Fig. 8C) the olivine is remobilized. Petrological and geochemical observations have shown that crystals can be remobilized by ascending melts (e.g., Cashman et al., 2017; Lange et al., 2013; Wieser et al., 2019). This would lead, for example, to reverse zoning in some olivines if the crystals had been remobilized by a more mafic melt, as observed in olivines Izu_4, Izu_5, Iwate_2 and Iwate_5 from Sukumoyama and Iwate. During olivine remobilization, the new melt may dissolve the olivine along defects or interact with the previous melt at reentrants of the crystal. Olivine crystallization will resume again trapping melts with a different composition to the melt in which the host crystal initially grew. Such a scenario is compatible with olivine Aoba_3-10-17-h3 (Fig. 8D). Indeed, this olivine crystallized with low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO due to localized interaction with a low \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO magma. The olivine was remobilized by the arrival of a new hotter, possibly wetter, melt resulting in its partial dissolution (possibly enhanced by decompression). Olivine re-crystallizes with a composition that is a mixture between the uncontaminated melt and the initial olivine composition.\nIf an olivine trapped a melt with a different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO composition to the initial melt in which it grew, the olivine around the inclusions should be in equilibrium with the melt. For example, Gurenko and Chaussidon (2002), in a study on Icelandic basalts found that only a 100 \u03bcm layer of olivine around the OHMI was in equilibrium with the OHMI. In this study, six of the olivines that were found to be in apparent disequilibrium with their OHMIs during the first SIMS session were selected to find possible olivine domains around the OHMIs that were in isotopic equilibrium (Supplementary Material 6-7). Half of them showed a small olivine domain (50 \u2013 60 \u03bcm) around the melt inclusions that is in equilibrium with the OHMIs, suggesting that these inclusions have been trapped in an olivine during its remobilization by a melt with a different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO composition. For the other olivines, it is possible that the olivine domain in O isotopic equilibrium with the OHMI has been polished away, could be below the surface or is smaller than the SIMS beam size (<10 \u2013 15 microns). In the OHMIs with only two olivine measurements, those with a large reproducibility (>0.4\u2030) most likely reflect that the melt inclusions formed in a partly recrystallized olivine. Overall, assuming that all the OHMIs in apparent disequilibrium have been trapped in a recrystallized olivine, \u223c70% of the studied OHMIs have been trapped during magma mixing.\n\n\n5.4\nImplications\nEpisodic recharge of melt pockets or magma chambers is widely recognized as a possible trigger for volcanic eruptions (e.g., Sparks et al., 1977). The proportion of remobilized and partly recrystallized crystals could provide valuable information about the plumbing system of a volcano: a high proportion of remobilized olivine suggests a high proportion of crystals in the last melt pocket, or that the ascending melt has scavenged crystals from different melt pockets as it ascended.\nOlivine partial dissolution due to temperature increase and\/or decompression, followed by infilling with a melt not necessarily in elemental and isotopic equilibrium with the initial olivine, explains the different major and trace element compositions of OHMIs trapped in a single crystal (e.g., olivines SVN181 from St. Vincent, Ao3-1, Ao15-10 olivines from Aoba in this study, or, for example ARP73-10-03_16, CH77-DR6-203_45 and CH77-DR6-203_55 from Mid-Atlantic Ridge, in Manzini et al., 2019). Such episodes of remobilization or mixing might not always be evident based solely on the major element composition of the olivine, due to fast Fe-Mg diffusion (e.g., Jurewicz and Watson, 1988; Gaetani and Watson, 2002). Thus, local O isotopic equilibrium between the OHMI and the host crystal provides more robust information. Furthermore, if melt inclusions are forming during olivine recrystallization, OHMIs within the same olivine host may not necessarily be trapped at the same P-T conditions even though the olivine is homogeneous in composition.\nAnother important piece of information is the variability of \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO, which reflects the influence from different slab components (Bouvier et al., 2019). As OHMIs that have formed in recrystallized olivine record the composition of different melt batches, they could be used to study whether melt batches and slab flux have varied over time. For example, the homogeneity of Vulcano OHMIs and the olivine hosts suggests that the melt batch in equilibrium with the melt inclusions was probably homogeneous. To the contrary, olivines SVN171 and SVN181 from St. Vincent might both have grew in two melt batches with different slab influence: they both contain primitive OHMIs with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of 6.9\u2030 in equilibrium with Fo83\u221285, and more evolved OHMIs with \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO at 5.3-5.4\u2030 surrounded by olivine Fo76\u221277 (see Supplementary Material 1).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nOxygen isotopes in olivines and OHMIs in basalts from five volcanoes located in different arcs exhibit a broad range of values that overlap, but with averages that differ from arc to arc. The variability measured in the olivines is not related to the variability measured in the OHMIs that they host. Olivines from four of the five volcanoes record either normal magmatic evolution or magma mixing, based on their Fo and \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO compositions. A relatively large proportion of the measurements (70% of XX51 olivine-OHMI pairs) suggest that the OHMIs are not in O isotopic equilibrium with their host, despite their major element compositions being in apparent equilibrium. The O isotopic disequilibrium cannot be explained by temperature variations, as this is not resolvable by SIMS measurements. Trace elements in the OHMIs and their host olivines do not support O isotope disequilibrium being a boundary layer effect. Analysing the olivines in more detail reveals that for most of the olivines at least one O isotope measurement is in equilibrium with each of the OHMIs that it hosts. The olivine domains that are in equilibrium with the OHMI are often <50 \u03bcm from the inclusions. It is concluded that these OHMIs were trapped when the olivines were remobilized by melts with different \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO compositions or were partly recrystallized during magma mixing. Careful screening of \n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n18\n\n\nOOl-MI, by measuring \n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n18\n\n\nO of the melt inclusion and at least 2-4 points in the olivine surrounding the melt inclusions and 2-4 in the olivine core and rim, possibly coupled with phosphorus maps, could open new perspectives: in association with diffusion profile measurements and petrological determination of temperature, it could be used to better understand, for example, melt inclusion formation, crystal history, architecture of magma plumbing systems and variation of slab fluxes.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nBouvier A.-S.: Data acquisition, Methodology, Validation, Vizualization, Conceptualization, Writing - original draft.

However, it is always not straightforward to be addressed, particularly when the final suturing following the ocean closure occurred softly, for instance, the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). In this study, a comprehensive dataset of detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes for the Middle Permian to Middle Jurassic foreland sediments from the Linxi region, southeastern CAOB, is synthesized. We observed multiple abrupt changes in sedimentary provenance over time from this dataset: (1) the ca. 275\u00a0Ma sediments (Upper Zhesi Fm.) were entirely sourced from the local NAO, whereas the ca. 270\u2013258\u00a0Ma sediments (Middle-Upper Linxi Fm.) received an additional detritus contribution from the northern NCC, (2) the ca. 257\u2013236\u00a0Ma sediments (Lower-Middle Xingfuzhilu Fm.) returned to a pure NAO source, but the slightly postdated ca. 227\u00a0Ma sediments (Upper Xingfuzhilu Fm.) show provenance affinities of both NAO and northern NCC, (3) the ca. 171\u00a0Ma sediments (Middle Xinmin Fm.) were exclusively derived from the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic magmas in the NAO and northern NCC with no Early Paleozoic and Precambrian detritus. The above episodic shifts in sedimentary provenance observed in the Linxi region, in conjunction with other regional geological evidence, provide key constraints on the pre- to post-collisional evolution in the southeastern CAOB, including the transition from waning subduction to initial collision, subsequent slab break-off and intracontinental contraction, and the post-collisional extension before the superposition of the Paleo-Pacific tectonic regime. Our results show that understanding the spatio-temporal changes of sedimentary provenance of the foreland basins systems during the plate convergence and orogenic evolution can aid in exploring the final collisional dynamics and evolutionary history in ancient accretionary orogens.\n               ","1":"\n                  We investigate 3-D thermal and rheological structures of the lithosphere beneath Northeast China using detailed P- and S-wave velocity models following mineral physics as well as geothermal methods. Small-scale temperature changes and thermal lithosphere thickness variations between different tectonic blocks are revealed. Our results show that strong lateral heterogeneities exist in the lithospheric thermal structure and rheological structure on both sides of the North-South Gravity Lineament (NSGL). The Changbai volcanic area and the central part of the Songliao Basin in the eastern side of the NSGL exhibit higher temperatures, thinner thermal lithosphere and lower rheological strength, which are closely associated with the western Pacific plate subduction under the Eurasian continent, resulting in upwelling of wet and hot asthenospheric material above the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone. The thermo-chemical erosion of the upwelling asthenospheric material may induce delamination of partial lithosphere under the Songliao Basin. In addition, the western and southern edges of the Songliao Basin are characterized by lower temperature, thicker thermal lithosphere and higher rheological strength, which may indicate a relatively stable lithosphere. The Halaha and Abaga volcanic areas in the western side of the NSGL exhibit higher temperature, thinner thermal lithosphere and lower rheological strength, which could be caused by small-scale upwelling of hot asthenospheric material associated with delamination of partial lithosphere beneath the Songliao Basin.\n               ","2":"\n                  Paleostress inversion of 141 outcrop-scale faults across the eastern flank of the southern Central Range of Taiwan where leveling and GPS data suggest a steep gradient in rock uplift rates yields two main kinematic phases of deformation. Phase 1 consists of 93 normal faults that generally dip moderately northeast whereas phase 2 consists of 48 strike-slip faults that generally dip steeply west-northwest. Both phases record NE-trending sub-horizontal extension but different orientations of principal shortening; in phase 1, the principal shortening axis is nearly vertical whereas in phase 2 it plunges gently to moderately southeast. The northeast extension is consistent with extension directions obtained from GPS and earthquake focal mechanisms in the central part of the southern Central Range. However, these indicators of contemporary deformation also reveal more complicated states of stress along the eastern and western flanks of the range and in the deep crust southwest of the range. We interpret these more complicated stress states as reflecting \u201cforceful extrusion\u201d of the southern Central Range where the lower crust is being pinched between more rigid crustal blocks represented by the Peikang High and the Luzon Arc. In this context, the temporal progress from strike-slip to normal faulting observed in outcrops may reflect the advection of the rocks from lower to higher structural levels. The northeast extension normal faults can be interpreted that accommodating the lateral and vertical movement of the crust in the southern Central Range. Based on thermochronological data and the onset of extrusion in southwest Taiwan in the late Pleistocene, we infer that this SW extrusion process may be younger the 0.5\u00a0Ma.\n               ","3":"\n                  The 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake occurred on the left-lateral Kunlun Pass-Jiangcuo fault (KPJF) located within the Bayan Har block, Tibetan Plateau, caused an \u223c165-km-long surface rupture and widespread ground deformation. This earthquake was well recorded by SAR images and our near-field GPS network during the coseismic and postseismic periods, providing a rare opportunity to shed light on the seismic and aseismic slip behaviors on the slow-slipping causative fault. Here, we constrain the coseismic slip distribution of the 2021 Maduo earthquake by the joint use of InSAR and near-field GPS observations. Then, time-dependent afterslip evolution is inverted from cGPS and InSAR time series in the first \u223c160\u00a0days after the mainshock. The results show that the mainshock involves five asperities with a maximum slip of 4.79\u00a0m, including an E-W trending main fault and a secondary fault locates on the eastern end of the main fault. The significant energy released near Changmahe Township could be partialy explained by the fact that the seismogenic fault here cut through the pre-existing NW-SE trending faults. Afterslip played a dominant role in the early postseismic deformation, which has released seismic moment equivalent to an Mw 6.78 earthquake, 10.3% of the coseismic moment. The seismic and aseismic slip distributions have complementary patterns in spatial, except for the overlaps on the Changmahe segment, suggesting the heterogeneity of frictional property on the fault plane. The rupture of the Maduo earthquake is located in the stress shadow induced by historical earthquakes, indicating the high accumulated stress on the KPJF. The stress level, as well as the potential seismic hazard on the \u223c300-km-long seismic gap between the 2001 Kokoxili earthquake and the 2021 Maduo earthquake, is further raised by the historical events.\n               ","4":"\n                  The morpho-tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau is controlled by complicated interactions between tectonic uplift and surface erosion. The Gangdese batholith in the southern Lhasa terrane is a key orogenic belt for exploring the complicated morpho-tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. In this contribution, we apply apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology to constrain the thermo-tectonic evolution of the central segment of the Gangdese batholith. Twenty-four granitoid samples were collected from both river valleys (e.g., the Yarlung and Xiang Rivers) and from the internal batholith areas located farther from river drainage (and\/or local faults) networks. All samples exhibit Miocene AFT ages between \u223c19.9 and\u00a0\u223c\u00a06.1\u00a0Ma. Inverse thermal history modeling results reveal that the central Gangdese batholith underwent a two-stage accelerated basement cooling in the Miocene. The first cooling stage took place during the late Oligocene to middle Miocene (\u223c25\u201315\u00a0Ma), this period of moderate to rapid basement cooling coincides with activity along the Gangdese thrust and Great Counter thrust system, and the Oligocene-Miocene delamination of the Lhasa lithosphere and concomitant asthenosphere upwelling. These tectonic processes acted as first-order control on regional basement uplift, denudation and exhumation. Second, a middle-late Miocene (\u223c14\u20135\u00a0Ma) rapid cooling is widely recognized in the whole Gangdese batholith. We suggest that this middle-late Miocene cooling is due to exhumation in response to tectonic and surface erosion processes such as N-S normal faults and enhanced river incision induced by the intensification of Asian monsoon. Finally, in combination with published low-temperature thermochronological and paleoaltimetry data, it is deduced that the present-day low-relief landscape of the southern Lhasa terrane resulted from a long-term balance between intense regional tectonic activity and surface erosion.\n               ","5":"\n                  In response to the craton destruction, the North China Craton (NCC) underwent the Early Cretaceous extensional tectonics. During this period, the eastern NCC has also experienced numerous plutonism, volcanism, and extensional structures. Particularly, half-graben or graben, Early Cretaceous extensional domes, metamorphic core complex, and syn-kinematic plutons are widespread throughout the NCC and its surrounding area, with a peaking age of 125\u00a0Ma, pointing to a large-scale severe NW-SE extension. However, it remains unknown when and how the large-scale extension is initiated. To answer this key issue, we choose two plutons (Fengjiayu-Xibailianyu and Gubeikou plutons) with the age of early stage of the Early Cretaceous (130\u2013127\u00a0Ma) as the target of this study. The Fengjiayu-Xibailianyu pluton is close to, while the Gubeikou pluton is far away from the Early Cretaceous intensive extensional region. A multidisciplinary study, including structural geology, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), and gravity modeling, has been carried out on these two plutons to reveal the tectonic regime coeval with their emplacement. Both of these two plutons share similar features of concentric magnetic foliations and variable magnetic lineations which are decoupled with the ductile fabric in their country rocks. Accordingly, we considered that they intruded in a permissive way at a weak extension regime during the Early Cretaceous (130\u2013127\u00a0Ma), just before the Late Mesozoic peak of the magma flare-up and large-scale extensional tectonics of the NCC. Combined with our previous works, the Early Cretaceous NW-SE trending extension in NCC was further subdivided into the early-stage weak extension during 130\u2013127\u00a0Ma and the late-stage intensive extension during 127\u2013110\u00a0Ma, namely the large-scale extension initiated after 127\u00a0Ma. The early-stage extension could be ascribed to the westward subduction of the Izanagi plate under the Eurasian continent.\n               ","6":"\n                  In this study, we present a high-resolution, 3-D S wave velocity (Vs) model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Liaodong area at the northeast margin of the North China Craton (NCC). We build the model based on ambient noise tomography. Ambient noise data were obtained from both permanent stations and two new broad-band station profiles covering the Dandong-Tongliao (NCISP-10) and Baishan-Kuandian (NCISP-11) areas of the Liaodong-jilin region from October 2016 to December 2019. Our model reveals that different sides of the Tanlu Fault exhibited different Vs anomalies in both the upper crust and lithospheric upper mantle. Low Vs anomalies are observed in the west of the Tanlu Fault, which are interpreted to represent compositional variations at the crustal level. On the eastern side, low Vs anomalies are imaged which appear to represent \u201cheat\u201d or \u201chot material\u201d derived from the deep mantle. A high Vs anomaly imaged in the southwest of the Songliao basin spatially coincides with a geologic feature referred to as the southwest uplift, which divides the basin into two secondary depressions. The Vs anomaly is inferred to represent cold mafic magma produced by the subduction of the Pacific Plate during the Late Cretaceous. Upwelling of mantle materials provide the best explanation for a mass of hot lithosphere. They underplated at the base of the crust, which formed crustal reservoirs and was eventually emplaced as plutons or erupted as volcanic rocks observed around the study area.\n               ","7":"\n                  The Calabrian Arc subduction complex, in the northern Ionian Sea, is facing directly the westward subducting Apulian Swell, a sliver of continental crust covered by about 8\u00a0km of Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonates. Deformation patterns of this southernmost foreland segment of the Adria plate, analized from marine geological\/geophysical data include: 1) flexure\/bending, under the load of the advancing Calabrian Arc wedge; 2) buckling in response to compression of the surrounding orogens (southern Apennines, Dinarides-Hellenides); and 3) roll-back and eastward retreat of the slab. In this work, a reprocessed dataset of marine seismic reflection profiles is used to determine the interplay between these tectonic processes during progressive advancement of the Calabrian Arc wedge since Pliocene times. Our analysis indicates that the wedge is presently affected by compressive tectonics along several fore-thrusts, forming an imbricate fan system. Conversely, the Apulian Swell affected by inherited and rift-related Permo-Triassic normal faults, shows transpressive and positive tectonic inversions and, in its southern portion, the effects of the Hellenic fold\/thrust belt shortening. The interference between the Calabrian Arc and the Hellenic chain plays an important role in controlling the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Apulian Swell, which underwent bending and roll-back during a pre-middle Pliocene stage followed by buckling processes. Active extension observed in the hinge zone of the Apulian Swell between Calabrian Arc and the Hellenides might suggest recent reactivation of flexure and retreat.\n               ","8":"\n                  The topographic evolution of SE Tibet is essential for understanding the growth of this orogenic plateau margin and the mechanism of continental deformation in general. Stable isotopes have been used to construct the paleo-elevation of SE Tibet during the Cenozoic. However, this methodology's reliability for the region is controversial; the results require validation through other independent constraints. The Eocene-Oligocene adakite-like rocks exposed along the Jinshajiang Suture are mostly the production of melts from the lower crust, and thus their geochemical features are used to track ancient crustal thickness and plateau elevation of SE Tibet. The whole-rock [La\/Yb]N ratios indicate a thickened SE Tibet. Meanwhile, the paleo-elevation based on the calculated crustal thickness shows that central and southeastern Tibet had reached modern heights by the early Oligocene, corroborating results by stable isotope paleoaltimetry. Synthesizing previous studies and our results, we suppose that the deformation caused by the India-Aisa collision had propagated to and thickened central and southeastern Tibet before the Eocene-Oligocene. The uplifted and low-gradient plateau margin of SE Tibet had already been formed by this time. The lateral extrusion has mainly accommodated the deformation with minor shortening since the late Eocene.\n               ","9":"\n                  The Xianshuihe fault on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is one of the most active intracontinental faults worldwide. At least 16 strong earthquakes (M\u00a0>\u00a06.5) have occurred on this fault since 1327\u00a0CE. To reasonably assess the future seismic hazard of this fault region, it is essential to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the fault kinematics and stress state. In this study, we developed a fine 3D geomechanical model of the Xianshuihe fault and its adjacent area, and obtained a spatially continuous contemporary kinematics and crustal background stress field of this region. Our modeled results show that the slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault is as high as 11\u00a0mm\/a on the northwestern segment and generally decreases to ~9\u00a0mm\/a on the southeastern segment (i.e. Moxi fault). The Yulongxi fault, a branch oblique to the Moxi fault, has different slip senses in different segments with a very low horizontal slip rate (<0.6\u00a0mm\/a). In terms of stress, the study area is dominated by a transtensional faulting stress regime with E-W-trending maximum horizontal stress SH, indicating the study area is mainly subjected to an E-W compression and N-S extension. Localized normal and thrust faulting regimes appear alternately along the Xianshuihe fault, showing an inhomogeneous stress state. The high normal stresses on the Songlinkou-Selaha segment and the Moxi fault combined with their relatively high slip rates, make us speculate that these two segments have the potential to produce strong earthquakes in the future. A relatively high seismic hazard is also ascribed to the Yulongxi fault based on the analysis of its geological and geodynamic environment.\n               ","10":"\n                  An M\n                     w 7.4 left-lateral earthquake hit Maduo County in Qinghai province, China, on 21 May 2021. In this paper, we combined the 1-Hz global navigation satellite system (GNSS) displacement waveforms, GNSS static offsets and the three-dimensional (3D) co-seismic deformation field from the interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) measurements to estimate the source kinematics of this event. Our results reveal that there was about 160\u00a0km of surface ruptures with varying strike angles, and the earthquake propagated bilaterally, with the bulk of the slip formed to the southeast of the epicenter. Substantial slip occurred to a depth of ~6\u00a0km, and the estimated maximum slip was ~5\u00a0m. The source time function presents a\u00a0~\u00a035-s total duration with two peaks, and the total geodetic seismic moment is 1.61\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01020\u00a0Nm (equivalent to M\n                     w 7.4). The near-field high-rate GNSS waveforms inversion results indicate that this earthquake is an overall subshear but locally supershear rupture event. The preferred average rupture velocity is 2.8\u00a0km\/s while the velocities to the southeast and northwest of epicenter are 3.8 and 2.2\u00a0km\/s, respectively. Supershear enhanced ground motion and simulation using the 3D curvilinear grid finite-difference method shows the acceleration caused by the earthquake exceeded the building code limits for bridges that collapsed due to strong ground shaking. Furthermore, this earthquake increased the stress level of the Maqin\u2013Maqu segment of the East Kunlun Fault, and was also responsible for an off-fault aftershock sequence at the northwest end of the earthquake rupture.\n               ","11":"\n                  Strong earthquakes occurring frequently in south Iceland are always characterized by intense aftershock activity.

The forecast is carried out manually but in a framework of a provisional operational earthquake forecasting (OEF) system and based on an informative set of ETAS parameters derived from the strong June 2000 sequence in the region. We show that the short-term forecasts are unreliable at the early stages of the ongoing seismic sequence due to incomplete aftershocks collected to feed the Bayesian updating procedure of the ETAS model parameters, mainly during the first hours after the \u00d6lfus mainshock. In contrast, issuing 24-h long forecasts, starting 6\u20138\u00a0h after the mainshock gives the best forecasting results. We allow the daily forecasts to adapt to the ongoing 2008 sequence using the adaptive prior estimation method, i.e., by assigning an informative prior distribution to ETAS parameters for the subsequent forecasting interval based on the preceding ETAS parameter posterior distributions. The parametric posteriors do not show narrow distributions, thus indicating inconsistent forecasting performance, both in stark contrast to the June 2000 sequence.

Paleomagnetic results reveal an ~25\u00b0 rotational difference between the two halves during deposition of the Shangganchaigou and Xiayoushashan formations. This rotational difference is consistent with the geometric trend change in the SAB, and its oroclinal bending is further constrained as having occurred during the middle to late Miocene (~17\u201310\u00a0Ma) based on similar rotation of nearby Heishiqiu. Combined with other paleomagnetic results along the ATF, we propose that a transitional zone with remarkable counterclockwise rotations\u00a0developed south of the fault due to the frictional dragging of the ATF, which is related to its tectonic transition from concentrated to distributed sinistral shear during the middle to late Miocene.\n               ","13":"\n                  The 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake ruptured the Jiangcuo fault, a secondary fault within the Bayan Har block, NE Tibetan Plateau, which attests that large earthquakes can occur on faults with very low slip rates. In this study, we use data from local seismic stations to explore the 3D velocity structure beneath the source region of the Maduo earthquake. Our results indicate that there is a distinct low-velocity anomaly in the mid-lower crust, and the thickness of this low-velocity zone decreases sharply to the east. The Maduo earthquake occurred in the transition zone between the high- and low-velocity regions. Based on our local velocity model and our knowledge of the regional crustal structures, we constructed numerical models to investigate the stress and strain energy distributions in our study area. As indicated by the stress concentration, strain energy accumulation, and low strain rate in the shallow upper crust around the source region, we conclude that the seismic velocity heterogeneity and the weak ductile mid-lower crust provide a unique tectonic environment that facilitated the nucleation of the Maduo earthquake. This study helps to understand the mechanisms of the Maduo earthquake, and more importantly reconciles the seeming contradiction between large earthquakes and low slip and strain rates.\n               ","14":"","15":"\n                  Indian Ocean geoid low, situated at the south of the Indian peninsula, is an intriguing feature. Hitherto, several interpretations have been put forth to explain the genesis and causative depths of the anomaly. In this work, we investigate the scaling spectral inversion approach utilizing gravity data to estimate the causative depth and nature of the source from this region. In practice, crustal or sub-surface heterogeneities follow scaling or fractal characteristics, and comparative studies across various regions suggest that the scaling power spectrum method provides better insights into the sub-surface source distribution. An optimum fitting and comparison between the modeled and observed power spectrum have been attained by utilizing two norm penalties e.g. L1 and L2 norms for various combinations of depth and scaling exponents. Equally important, the L1 norm misfit function yields better results when compared to the L2 norm function. We propose that estimated source depths (\u033480\u00a0km and 120\u00a0km, respectively) are perfect examples of a half-space model with a source following scaling or fractal characteristics (scaling exponent value of \u03341.78) along the upper mantle boundary. However, the scaling spectrum windowing analysis of the studied region reveals a variable depth to long wavelength sources as 1014\u00a0km, 431\u00a0km, and 94\u00a0km, which conform well with the recently published depth range. Further, the weight of low and high wavenumbers indicates that the causative source depths might be due to the above-stated depth range rather than a single model fit. The study has demonstrated a good case for wider use of L1 norm-based power spectrum inversion for source depth estimation from potential field data. We further suggest that the causative source for the Indian Ocean geoid low may extend deeper than upper mantle discontinuities.\n               ","16":"\n                  We investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of strain accommodation during multiphase rift evolution in the Shire Rift Zone (SRZ), East Africa.

Our observations show that although the rift border faults largely mimic the pre-rift basement metamorphic fabrics, the rift termination zones occur near crustal-scale rift-orthogonal basement shear zones (Sanangoe (SSZ) and the Lurio shear zones) during RP1-RP2 period. In RP3, the RP1-RP2 sub-basins were largely abandoned, and the rift axes migrated northeastward (rift-orthogonally) into the RP1-RP2 basin margin, and northwestward (strike-parallel) ahead of the RP2 rift-tip. The northwestern RP3 rift-axis side-steps across the SSZ with a rotation of border faults across the shear zone, and terminates farther northwest at another regional-scale shear zone. We suggest that over the multiple pulses of tectonic extension and strain migration in the SRZ, pre-rift basement fabrics acted as: 1) favorably-oriented zones of mechanical strength contrast that localized the large rift faults, and 2) mechanical \u2018barriers\u2019 that refracted and possibly, temporarily halted the lateral propagation of the rift zone. Further, the cooled RP1-RP2 mafic dikes localized later-phase deformation in the form of border fault hard-linking transverse faults that exploited strength contrasts within the dike clusters and served as mechanically-strong zones that arrested some of the RP3 fault-tips. Overall, we argue that during pulsed rift propagation, inherited crustal strength anisotropies may serve as both strain-localizing, refracting, and \u2018strain barrier\u2019 tectonic structures.\n               ","17":"\n                  The slip rates on the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault system (XXFS) are crucial for understanding the strain partitioning and evaluating its seismic risk.

To explore the relationship between fault interaction and earthquake migration in this target area, we simulated the Coulomb stress change (\u0394CFS) caused by 13 historical large earthquakes (M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06.0) since 1968. We show that the 1968 earthquake (Mw 7.2) on the Palu-Koro Fault promoted the 1996 earthquake sequence (Mw 7.9, Mw 6.6, and Mw 7.0) on the Minahassa Megathrust by transferring positive stress to its western edge with a maximum \u0394CFS value of 124\u00a0kPa before 1996.

In the western section, normal faults and negative flower structures occur within the strata of the upper plate. An unconformity represents the signal of tectonically driven subsidence. In the eastern section, both thick-skinned and thin-skinned thrusting are found within the frontal upper plate. In the central section, rare extensional or shortening deformation is identified within the forearc basement and overlying strata. Horizontal, thick sedimentary sequences within the Caroline subbasin have been subducted beneath the upper plate. This suggests that Miocene subduction in the eastern section led to the formation of a thrust-deformed ophiolitic basement in the upper plate. Since the Miocene, strike-slip tectonic processes dominated in the upper plate, causing compressional deformation in the strata in the eastern section and extensional to transtensional deformation in the strata in the western section. The strike-slip tectonic processes might have been weakened in the upper plate in central section due to the incoming Eauripik Rise.

Here, we image the subsurface velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the DZB and its surroundings by using eikonal equation-based tomography to study the crustal flow and deformation mechanisms. In this study, we collect high-quality seismic data from 290 broadband seismic stations and manually pick a total of 31,981 first arrivals.

We investigated the normal faulting mechanism through (1) co- and postseismic kinematic models constrained by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and (2) analytical force balance modeling with a thin viscous approximation. We used the InSAR time series technique to map the postseismic deformation within 3\u00a0years following the 2008 Yutian earthquake. The InSAR-derived afterslip model revealed a clear slip polarity transition from strike-slip to normal faulting, suggesting a tight connection between the normal faulting and bounding strike-slip faults. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-constrained thin viscous sheet model gave an estimate of ~1022\u00a0Pa\u2219s for the effective viscosity of the West Kunlun lithosphere, which is generally in line with previous estimates that used a similar methodology. The stress field predicted by the thin viscous model primarily features north\u2013south compression rather than east\u2013west extension, suggesting that normal faulting is caused not by the GPE contrast across the margin of West Kunlun, but instead by the releasing step-overs bounded by strike-slip faults.

Spatial patterns of surface cooling ages are consistent with an overthrusting of the Himalayan wedge above a mid-crustal ramp in the MHT. Thermokinematic inverse modeling yields contrasting geometries and kinematics for the mid-crustal ramp on both sides of the CCS. Specifically, to the west of the CCS, the MHT developed a major ramp (with a dip angle of 20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00b0) spanning 50\u201370\u00a0km, which initiated at ~11.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0Ma. To the east, thermokinematic inversion suggests a much less developed ramp spanning only ~10\u201315\u00a0km, initiated at ~6.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Ma. These results imply an ~14-km deeper depth of the MHT to the west of the CCS than to the east. Our modeling also suggests distinctive and evolving ramp-thrusting rates for the MHT on both sides of the CCS. This suggests an independent deformation accommodation by the MHT ramp thrusting in segments divided by the CCS along strike. Our study highlights a genetic correlation between the active orogenic-parallel ramp evolution and the N-S-trending faulting across the Himalaya, which divides the orogenic-parallel tectonics into independent structural segments.\n               ","23":"\n                  Clast\u2013cortex aggregates (CCAs) have been commonly reported in experimental and natural fault gouges. Here we discuss the formation process of CCAs and its mechanical implications, based on experimentally simulated fault gouges. We conducted low- to high-velocity rotary shear experiments on Ca-bentonite gouges at a normal stress of 1\u00a0MPa, slip rates of 0.01\u20131.31\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121, and ambient temperature and humidity conditions. The CCAs consist of a central clast (mostly quartz fragments with subordinate clay aggregates) and a concentric rim of nano-clay particles (i.e., cortex). The CCAs range in size from 1 to 100\u00a0\u03bcm and developed adjacent to a foliated high-strain layer at all slip rates. The microstructures suggest that the CCA-rich layer was mainly deformed by granular flow, whereas the foliated high-strain layer was deformed by cataclastic flow. The increase in average size of the CCAs with displacement and the formation of their concentric rims suggest that the CCAs grew like a rolling snowball. The estimated strain rates obtained from the concentric layers of the CCAs and strain markers indicate the existence of a range of shear strain rates that favors granular flow and the formation and growth of CCAs.\n               ","24":"\n                  Low Strain Rate regions (LSRrs), i.e., areas undergoing tectonic deformation at rates of 1\u00a0mm\/yr or less, often host important cities and highly vulnerable anthropogenic assets, and due to their subdued topography and relatively infrequent seismicity, are often considered low seismic hazard areas. Despite this, infrequent but high-magnitude earthquakes in such regions suggest that identifying active structures in the LSRr is one of the primary challenges for both the scientific community and modern societies. In such regions, one of the main issues in identifying active faults is the lack of valuable outcrop data due to erosional\/sedimentation rates overwhelming the fault deformation, causing the hidden morphological signature of the tectonic structures.\n                  This work proposes a multidisciplinary approach designed to detect active geological structures and their related deformation in such areas. Our approach consists of quantitative morphotectonic, offshore and onshore tectonostratigraphic and GNSS joint analyses. To test this approach, we selected as a natural laboratory the partially offshore northern Sicilian LSRr (southern Italy) in the coastal sector located between the two major cities of Palermo and Termini Imerese. This area includes the compressional structures of the northern sector of the Apennine-Maghrebian fold and thrust belt, presently accommodating the slow Africa-Europe plate convergence.\n                  The main results we achieved are 1) new evidence of active tectonic deformation in this region; 2) the 3D modelling of two NNW-trending active faults; 3) the slip rate of a segment of the westernmost of the two detected faults; 4) a newly recorded relative GNSS velocity field; 5) a new morphotectonic map and morphotectonic evolution model of the study area. Our multidisciplinary approach allowed us to shed new light on the active tectonic framework of a slowly deforming area that crosses the physical limit of the coastline.\n               ","25":"\n                  The seismic, geodetic, and tsunami observations are utilized to investigate the October 30th 2020 Samos, Greece earthquake. We adopt back projection (BP) and multi-point source (MPS) techniques to determine the rupture directivity and focal mechanism change of this event. Both methods reveal a unilateral rupture propagation to the west of the epicenter, and also resolve a changed focal mechanism. We use a two-segment-faults geometry to parameterize the fault model with strikes at 283\u00b0 for the east segment and 250\u00b0 for the west respectively, and conduct a finite fault inversion (FFI) combining seismic and geodetic observations. The kinematics results indicate the whole rupture process lasts about 25\u00a0s, yielding a total seismic moment of 3.16\u00d71019\u00a0Nm (Mw = 6.9) with a peak moment rate reaching 3.1\u00d71018\u00a0Nm\/s around 10\u00a0s. The rupture is composed of two asperities separated by the junction of two fault planes. The main slip area, with maximum amplitude reaching three meters, distributes at a shallow depth and displays a complementary pattern with aftershocks. The slip in the first six seconds is dominated by a pure normal faulting mechanism, while the following rupture includes an additional strike-slip component. The change of focal mechanism reflects the tectonic transition from dilatation to lateral shearing, which is also evident in the aftershock mechanisms. The synthetic tsunami waves also well fit three tidal gauge observations. The coseismic Coulomb stress is calculated to analyze the relationship between the mainshock and aftershock evolution. The mechanism combination of two rupture epochs reflects the combination of shear and dilatational stress status and complicated fault system of the Samos source area.\n               ","26":"\n                  This study is the first detailed investigation of the tectono-stratigraphy, regional structure and mesoscopic fractures of the Zagros fold-thrust belt in the Duhok region, Kurdistan, Northern Iraq, and is based on field studies, remote sensing-GIS analyses, cross-section restorations, and tectonic analysis of key structures. The Duhok fold belt is a frontal zone of the north-western part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt in the Kurdistan region near the north-eastern margin of the Arabian Plate. It is characterized by WNW-ESE striking, doubly-plunging, upright symmetric to asymmetric detachment folds that involve ~8.2\u201310.9\u00a0km of Paleozoic to Quaternary strata. These folds vary from 5 to 75\u00a0km long, 4\u201320\u00a0km wide and have a surface relief (caused by basement uplift) up to 3.2\u00a0km. Five regional and twelve local structural cross-sections were constructed parallel to the regional SSW tectonic transport and perpendicular to the fold axial trends. Section lengths vary between 4.94\u00a0km and 101.55\u00a0km. Two main detachment levels have been inferred for the Duhok fold belt. A deep basal detachment was placed at the base of the Paleozoic successions within the Ordovician shales of the Khabour Formation at depths from 8\u00a0km to 10\u00a0km. Shallower, intermediate detachment levels occur within the shales and evaporites of the Mid-Upper Permian and Upper Jurassic strata at depths 1.7\u00a0km in the frontal sectors to around 5.5\u00a0km in the hinterland. The thickness of the Paleozoic succession in the Duhok fold belt is ~2\u00a0km. Deformation by thin-skinned detachment folding together with thick-skinned thrusting is inferred to have occurred in the Duhok region from the Mid Miocene through to the Present-Day. The maximum NNE-SSW-directed shortening produced by detachment folding was about 18.62\u00a0km (19.71%) over a section length of 94.45\u00a0km. The maximum shortening along thrust faults was around 1.98\u00a0km (1.95%) over a section length of 101.55\u00a0km. The mesoscopic fracture patterns in the study area were grouped into two major extension sets, four major shear-hybrid sets and eight minor shear-hybrid sets. Field characteristics and relative chronology indicate that most of the fractures are tectonic in origin, and they developed before (i.e., pre-folding fractures) and during (i.e., early- and late-folding fractures) the Mid Miocene folding in the Duhok fold belt.\n               ","27":"\n                  A major goal in earthquake physics is to derive a constitutive framework for fault slip that captures the dependence of shear strength on fault rheology, sliding velocity, and pore-fluid pressure. In this study, we present H-MEC (Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a newly-developed two-phase flow numerical framework \u2014 which couples solid rock deformation and pervasive fluid flow \u2014 to simulate how crustal stress and fluid pressure evolve during the earthquake cycle. This unified, continuum-based model, incorporates a staggered finite difference\u2013marker-in-cell method and accounts for inertial wave-mediated dynamics and fluid flow in poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. Global Picard-iterations and an adaptive time stepping allow the correct resolution of both long- and short-time scales, ranging from years to milliseconds. We present a comprehensive in-plane strike-slip setup in which we test analytical poroelastic benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point along a finite fault width. We then investigate how pore-fluid pressure evolution and solid\u2013fluid compressibility control sequences of seismic and aseismic fault slip. While the weakening phase is controlled by localized compaction of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone, the subsequent propagation of dynamic ruptures is driven by pore-pressure waves. Furthermore, pore-fluid pressure conditions on the fault and shear strength weakening associated with rapid self-pressurization of fluids control the characteristic slip-weakening distance, the final size of seismic events, and the scaling between slip and fracture energy observed for large earthquakes. Our modeling results demonstrate that fault failure can occur due to poroelastic coupling on a finite-width shear zone, thus highlighting the importance of considering the realistic hydro-mechanical structure of faults to investigate fluid-driven seismic and aseismic slip, either as a natural process or induced by human activities.\n               ","28":"\n                  Late Mesozoic magmatism in eastern China was extensive and closely related to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate, but genetic relationship between magmatism and subduction remains unclear. Cretaceous magmatic rocks distributed along the eastern coast of China can provide an opportunity to evaluate the influence of subduction on the evolution of the magmatism. Here, a combined study of whole-rock major-trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes as well as zircon U-Pb ages was carried out for the Cretaceous granitoids in Liyang volcanic basin, eastern China. Zircon U-Pb dating results indicate that the Liyang granitoids were emplaced in the Early Cretaceous (ca. 130\u2013125\u00a0Ma). These samples (SiO2\u00a0=\u00a070.8\u201375.3\u00a0wt%) are mainly composed of high-K calc-alkaline granite and granite porphyry. Their geochemical characteristics are similar to I-type granites, with enrichment in LREEs, Rb, Th and U, and negative Eu (\u03b4Eu\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u20130.51), Ba, Sr, P and Ti anomalies. All samples show negative whole-rock \u03b5Nd(t) (\u22129.8 to \u22125.7) and zircon \u03b5Hf(t) (\u221215.7 to \u22123.60) values (corresponding crustal Hf model ages of 1.40\u20132.17\u00a0Ga), and high radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions. The integrated interpretation of geochemical data reveal that rollback of the Paleo-Pacific subducted slab resulted in lithospheric extension and thinning, and the upwelling of hot asthenosphere in eastern China, which induced more intensive underplating of the mantle-derived mafic magma. The ascent of heat and mafic magma, intruded in Meso-Neoproterozoic crust, and triggered partial melting of the Meso-Neoproterozoic crust. The Liyang I-type granitoids were the result of the Meso-Neoproterozoic crustal components mixing with a small number of mantle-derived magmas in the extensional tectonic setting, which was response to slab rollback of the Paleo-Pacific plate.\n               ","29":"\n                  Earthquakes on faults in the brittle upper crust evoke sudden changes in pore fluid pressure as well as postseismic viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle but the relative importance of these processes during the postseismic phase has not been systematically studied. Here, we use two-dimensional finite-element models to investigate how pore fluid pressure changes and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation interact during the earthquake cycle of an intracontinental dip-slip fault. To isolate the effects from pore fluid flow and viscoelastic relaxation from each other, we performed experiments with and without pore fluid flow and viscoelastic relaxation, respectively. In different experiments, we further varied the permeability of the crust and the viscosity of lower crust or lithospheric mantle. Our model results show poroelastic effects dominate the velocity field in the first months after the earthquake. In models considering poroelastic effects, the surfaces of both hanging wall and footwall of the normal fault subside at different velocities, while they move upwards in the thrust fault model. Depending on the permeability and viscosity values, viscoelastic relaxation dominates the velocity field from about the second postseismic year onward although poroelastic effects may still occur if the permeability of the upper crust is sufficiently low. With respect to the spatial scales of poroelastic effects and viscoelastic relaxation, our results show that pore fluid pressure changes affect the velocity field mostly within 10\u201320\u00a0km around the fault, whereas the signal from viscoelastic relaxation is recognizable up to several tens of kilometres away from the fault. Our findings reveal that both poroelastic effects and viscoelastic relaxation may overlap earlier and over longer time periods than previously thought, which should be considered when interpreting aftershock distributions, postseismic Coulomb stress changes and surface displacements.\n               ","30":"\n                  Seismicity and focal mechanisms within the NE-SW extending Usangu basin of the Western branch, north to northeast of the Rungwe Volcanic Province (RVP) southern Tanzania were determined from data recorded on temporary SEGMeNT and permanent AfricaArray seismic stations. The aim of the study has been to investigate stress regime and evaluates the role played by the Usangu basin in accommodating the relative movement between the two sub-basins of the Rukwa rift and the Malawi rift. Results show that most of the seismicity (~70%) concentrates along the Usangu border fault. A lesser amount of seismicity (~30%) is found within the basin and in the southwestern end of the basin towards the RVP. These findings suggest that the Usangu border fault, intrabasinal and transfer faults within the basin are associated with the seismic activities. This implies ongoing active deformation within the basin, which is accommodated by slip on the Usangu border fault system and seismicity associated with intrabasinal faults could indicate the temporal strain migration from the border fault. Although it has previously been suggested that the Eastern branch propagates southeasterly towards the coast, however, given the dense and long deployment of seismic station within the study area the possibility of second propagation of the Eastern branch towards the RVP in the Western branch cannot be ruled out. The seismicity therefore indicates that the Western branch could likely link with the Eastern branch via a wide zone of deformation combining the Mamizi-Kilombero-Ruhuhu fault zone and the zone of Mtera-Ruaha-Usangu rift graben, Focal mechanisms along the Usangu border fault and transfer faults within the basin show a combination of normal faulting and strike slip motion indicating extension with sinistral and dextral components of motion, consistent with palaeostress data and the strike slip deformation within the basin through accommodating the relative movement between the southern-most sub-basin of the Rukwa rift and northern-most sub-basin of the Malawi rift.\n               ","31":"\n                  A rift basin developed in the Neoproterozoic Tarim Craton and it provides a key perspective for understanding the breakup of Rodinia.

A total of 1503 ages from 11 samples are reported and two kinds of age distribution patterns are recognized. Samples of the Qiaoenbrak Group show unimodal distribution with most ages at 900\u2013800\u00a0Ma; samples of the upper two formations show bimodal distribution: One age range at 900\u2013600\u00a0Ma and another at 2000\u20131800\u00a0Ma. The emergence of Paleoproterozoic zircons indicates uplift and exhumation of the basement, which is compatible with plume upwelling. We find that there are prominent gaps between depositional ages and crystalline ages of detrital zircons, which corresponds with a plume environment instead of a back-arc environment. Besides, seismic and well data show that the Qiaoenbrak Group was deposited in (half-)grabens controlled by normal faults. The lower Sinian was less restricted but still affected by these faults, while the Upper Sinian thickens prominently towards the outer edge of the basin. Together, we propose a new two-stage plume-induced model for the Neoproterozoic rift in the Tarim Craton in which two different evolution paths are recognized: From rift to aulacogen for the Nanhua Qiaoenbrak Group, and from rift to passive margin for the Sinian System\n               ","32":"\n                  Inelastic off-fault deformation can lead to large tsunamigenesis in different tectonic settings. Here a mechanism for tsunami generation by strike-slip earthquakes that involves dynamic off-fault failure at restraining bends is presented. Dynamic rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault is modeled with undrained inelastic off-fault response incorporated by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. I show that in a local transpressive stress regime dynamic off-fault failure at restraining bends produces significantly larger and more localized surface uplift than is produced by purely elastic dislocation models, resulting in a positive flower and coseismic pop-up structure. The larger uplift is due to frictional sliding with a thrust component on conjugate microfractures, modeled by inelastic deformation. The short-wavelength inelastic uplift, largely controlled by bend size, is shown to generate localized tsunami efficiently in a shallow bay by fully coupling dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami. Fully-coupled models also indicate that supershear rupture on a vertical planar strike-slip fault does not generate large tsunami as the large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by ocean acoustic waves. Dynamic off-fault failure at fault complexities, such as restraining bends and compressional stepovers, may need be urgently incorporated in the current tsunami hazard assessments in strike-slip environments.\n               ","33":"\n                  The late Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonothermal history of the basin-and-range system within the Cathaysia Block in the southeastern South China Block remains poorly constrained, despite its significance in the tectonic and topographic evolution of eastern China. Zircon and apatite fission-track thermochronometers were applied to reconstruct the cooling histories of NE-trending mountain ranges mantled by late Mesozoic granites and older basement rocks in southwest Fujian. New zircon and apatite fission-track data record post-magmatic cooling of the sampled granites since their emplacement of ~164\u2013118\u00a0Ma. Thermal modeling of the thermochronology data revealed two episodes of accelerated cooling events at ~110\u201385\u00a0Ma and ~40\u201325\u00a0Ma. The late Early Cretaceous initiation of an accelerated cooling event at rates of ~6\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma was considered to be the cause of the formation of the basin-and-range system in a back-arc extensional setting related to the rollback of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. The second cooling event at ~40\u201325\u00a0Ma at a rate of ~20\u00a0\u00b0C\/Ma, reflected by the youngest apatite fission track ages (~25\u201320\u00a0Ma), was likely ascribed to headwater erosion along the drainage divide related to the intensification of the East Asian Monsoon and extensional tectonism. The sharp discrepancy in apatite fission track ages across the Zhenghe-Dapu Fault zone implies that the collapse of the late Mesozoic coastal magmatic arc in the early Eocene (51.4\u201345.6\u00a0Ma). This is attributed to the northward propagation of extension related to the rollback of the Paleo-Pacific Plate that formed the eastward-dipping topography. Furthermore, the long-lasting extension due to the rollback of the Pacific Plate since the ridge subduction of the Izanagi-Pacific at ~50\u00a0Ma likely drove the exhumation of the Cathaysia Block and opening of the South China Sea.\n               ","34":"\n                  To investigate the mechanism of tectonic tremor and the factors that influence its occurrence and fluctuations, we use seismic reflection data to map in detail a shear zone associated with the plate boundary fault in the Nankai accretionary prism, southwest Japan. The shear zone can be identified from its low seismic velocity and low reflection amplitude, which may signify the presence of high pore pressure, around the transition boundary from frontal outer wedge to inner wedge. A detailed comparison of the mapped shear zone and the distribution of tectonic tremor demonstrate that tremor tended to occur in the thick part of the shear zone, where high pore fluid pressure may weaken faults and thereby facilitate slow earthquakes. Furthermore tremors align on the oblique strike-slip faults that caused variation of the shear zone thickness as well as fluctuation of stress and pore pressure. The oblique strike-slip faults that control the thickness of the shear zone and tremor distributions are interpreted as features formed by the collision of an accretionary prism against a landward tectonic backstop.\n               ","35":"\n                  We assemble the continuous waveform data recorded by 571 broadband temporary seismic stations from 2014 to 2015 in the northeastern (NE) margin of the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding regions. Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocity dispersion curves (T\u00a0=\u00a05\u201350\u00a0s) are obtained by the image transformation technique. Then the phase velocity dispersion data are used to jointly invert the 3-D shear wave velocity (Vs) and radial anisotropy (\u03be) models in the study region with the direct surface wave radial anisotropy tomography (DRadiSurfTomo) method. The \u03be is negative and positive in the upper crust and mid-to-lower crust, respectively, indicating that the crustal deformation pattern is depth-dependent. The middle crust beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau generally exhibits positive \u03be. Two low-velocity zones (LVZs) are detected beneath the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block and the western Qinling orogen as well as the northern Qilian orogen. High-velocity zone (HVZ) and positive \u03be are characterized in the mid-to-lower crust beneath both the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. Combining with the previous results, we propose these two blocks, as a whole belonging to a part of the North China Craton (NCC), effectively restrict the northeastward growth of the Tibetan plateau.

In this study, we collected samples from the boreholes in Shanghai, East China and provided geochronological, elemental and isotopic analyses of andesite and granodiorite. Zircon UPb age results indicate that andesites and granodiorites were formed at ca. 135 to 102\u00a0Ma. The andesites exhibit moderate MgO contents, slightly radiogenic Sr (87Sr\/86Sr(t)\u00a0=\u00a00.706149 to 0.706170) and variable unradiogenic Nd and Hf isotopic compositions (\u03b5Nd(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125.32 to \u22125.12; \u03b5Hf(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210.8 to \u22120.6). The granodiorites exhibit arc-like trace-element patterns with high Sr\/Y ratios, as well as slightly radiogenic initial Sr (87Sr\/86Sr(t)\u00a0=\u00a00.706754 to 0.706790) and moderately unradiogenic Nd and Hf isotopic compositions (\u03b5Nd(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22126.54 to \u22126.27; \u03b5Hf(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212 4.0 to \u22126.7). Both andesites and granodiorites exhibit similar initial Pb isotopic compositions (andesites: 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a018.232\u201318.259, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.547\u201315.548, and 208Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a038.338\u201338.350; granodiorites: 206Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a017.930\u201317.946, 207Pb\/204Pb\u00a0=\u00a015.542\u201315.543, and 208Pb\/204Pb (38.256\u201338.293). The results recommend that the ca.130\u00a0Ma andesites were produced by the partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle, which was previously metasomatized with sediments in the source region in a continental arc setting of the Paleo-Pacific subduction. The ca.102\u00a0Ma adakitic granodiorites probably originated from partial melting of the lower crust with the addition of mantle-derived magmas. With the consolidation of previous studies, we argue that the flat slab subduction of the paleo-Pacific Plate led to the formation of these intermediate to felsic magmatism.\n               ","37":"\n                  Whether the central metamorphic belt of the Qiangtang terrane in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau should be attributed to a suture zone, is still heavily debated, due to inadequate deep structure constraints. Using the data collected from 16 stations in the northern part of the Hi-Climb profile and 16 broadband seismic stations recently arranged in the northern part of Gaize County, this study developed a broadband seismic profile running through the in-situ Central Qiangtang Metamorphic Belt (CQMB) roughly along 84.5\u00b0E. Significantly characteristics of the crust and mantle structure beneath the profile were obtained through P-wave receiver function analyses: (i) The south Qiangtang terrane has a complex Moho structure at depth 56\u201382\u00a0km, while the north Qiangtang terrane has a nearly horizontal Moho at depth approximately 62\u00a0km. Moreover, the northward-inclining Moho is noticeably dislocated with a maximum offset of approximately 18\u00a0km under the CQMB. (ii) The crustal low-velocity zones on both sides of the CQMB are transversely discontinuous and are also distinct from each other. (iii) A northward-subducting interface occurs beneath the in-situ CQMB (34.0\u00b0N\u201334.5\u00b0 N). Based on the geological outcrops and their petrological analysis, the structural characteristics beneath the CQMB are interpreted as the traces of the Longmucuo-Shuanghu suture zone, which was formed by the northward subduction-collision of the south Qiangtang terrane left after the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean at the end of the Triassic.\n               ","38":"\n                  The structure of the southeastern Gulf of California rifted margin is only partly known because of the thick sedimentary cover of the continental shelf and coastal areas of Sinaloa and Nayarit. Here we report the subsurface structure and probable age of the Mazatl\u00e1n basin, one of the largest buried basins, based on interpretation of reprocessed by multichannel 2D reflection seismic profiles and an exploratory well drilled by Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) between 1979 and 1980, as well as gravimetric data. The Mazatl\u00e1n basin is located just north of the active subduction zone of the Rivera plate and west of the new oceanic crust accreted since the Pliocene at the mouth of the Gulf. The basin is bounded to the west by a high of the Late Cretaceous batholiths exposed in the Tres Marias Islands and in the normal faults bounding the Nayarit Troughs, and to the east by the late Oligocene-early Miocene extensional faults bounding the Sierra Madre Occidental. Based on the characteristics of the seismic profiles, the basin can be divided into three main sectors. The transition between the northern and central sectors is defined by an abrupt deepening of the basement that corresponds to the westward prolongation of ENE-WSW trending accommodation zones separating opposite tilted domains in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The acoustic basement is clearly defined in the central sector by a set of high-amplitude reflectors suggesting an igneous origin. The deepest part of the basin is located toward the coastal plain of Nayarit and coincides with a gravimetric minimum. We identify several high amplitude reflectors interpreted as mafic sills, which become more abundant toward the south. At least part of them can be correlated with the widespread mafic volcanism emplaced at 9\u201312\u00a0Ma along the eastern margin of the Gulf of California rift. In the northern and central sectors we identified three main stratigraphic boundaries (L1, L2, and L3) within the basin filling, which define seismo-stratigraphic sequences. The shallower sequences, limited by the L1 and L2 boundaries and attributed to the Pleistocene and part of the Pliocene, lack evidence of significant deformation. The sequence above L3 boundary, can be assigned to the earliest Pliocene and the Miocene since they are intruded by a\u00a0~\u00a010\u00a0Ma basaltic sill cut by the Huichol-1 exploratory well. The lower part of the basin is characterized by high amplitude reflectors that pinches out against the acoustic basement and correspond to volcanic tuffs and sedimentary deposits correlative with the lower member of the Comond\u00fa group exposed in Baja California, which includes ~23 to ~19\u00a0Ma distal part of ignimbrites sourced from the Sierra Madre Occidental in Nayarit. Faults with the most significant displacements have a listric geometry and dip from the E to NE. The maximum sediment thickness reported in the Huichol-1 well is 2800\u00a0m, with a two-way travel time of 2.7\u00a0s, but it reaches 3.7 TWTT in some areas. Based on sedimentation rates, the minimum age for the onset of sedimentation in the basin is ~19\u00a0Ma, which is consistent with the regional tectonic evolution of the margin.\n               ","39":"\n                  We investigate the evolution of the Gulf of Aden from rift initiation to the development of active oceanic spreading center by means of 2D thermo-mechanical numerical models, in which the formation of oceanic crust and serpentinite due to the hydration of the uprising mantle peridotite has been implemented. Our analysis highlights that evolution of the models is characterized by four main tectonic phases: a) a first phase (phase I) characterized by low deformation rates throughout the divergent crustal blocks, except near the future ridge where a high crustal velocity gradient generates an intense strain rates; b) a second phase (phase II) during which the crust undergoes an intense, stable and widespread strain, with the localization of the thinning near the future ridge that ends into crustal breakup c) a third phase (phase III) that characterizes the post- crustal breakup evolution of the models during which a mechanical relaxation of the system and a continuum decreasing of the strain rate can be observed, until the occurrence of lithospheric breakup, and d) fourth phase (phase IV) that lasts up to the end of the evolution and during which the two continental blocks move rigidly. We also find that the timing of mantle serpentinization is not affected by the initial thermal configuration of the lithosphere, but a relationship with the crustal thickness can be observed. Rather, the timing of mantle partial melting strongly depends on the initial thermal conditions of both the lithosphere and the crust. We constrain the crustal and lithospheric thickness at 40 and 150\u00a0km, respectively, considering the timing of breakup that occurs 20 Myr after the onset of the extension for 0.05% percentage of mantle hydration (in agreement with magma-poor rift margins). Finally, model prediction supports the hypothesis that the Gulf of Aden developed as a slow passive rift of a thin lithosphere with a thick crust and the variation of the features along the passive margins could be related to a lateral variation in the amount of H2O in the mantle, which determines different timing in the mantle melting.\n               ","40":"\n                  To understand the post-orogenic tectonics related to collision between the North China Craton (NCC) and the South China Block (SCB), the Northern Sulu massif is a representative area. It experienced a complex evolution marked by exhumation of ultra-high-pressure metamorphism rocks, migmatization, and alkaline magmatism in the Latest Triassic, and felsic magmatism in the Late Jurassic. In this contribution, we carried out a combined study including structural analysis, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), and gravity survey on the Northern Sulu massif. According to our structural analysis, it is interpreted as an extensional dome, exhibiting dominantly SE-dipping foliations in its east and center and NW-dipping ones closer to its northwestern margin, NW-SE mineral and stretching lineations, and top-to-the-NW kinematics. The Latest Triassic pyroxene syenite has dominantly SE-dipping mesoscopic\/magnetic foliations, NW-SE magnetic lineations, and wedge shape at depth, and the Latest Triassic quartz syenite has variable magnetic fabric. Considering geometric relations of plutons and country rocks, the former is a \u201csyn-kinematic\u201d pluton, while the latter post-dates the regional tectonics, constraining the timing of the top-to-the-NW shearing at 220\u2013210\u00a0Ma. Compared with the syn-orogenic tectonic events, the Latest Triassic ductile deformation points to a NW-SE extension related to lithospheric delamination. Late Jurassic isotropic monzogranite is characterized by \u201conion-skin\u201d magnetic foliations with NE-SW trending magnetic lineations, and NE- or SW-ward decrease of thickness at depth. On the basis of regional understanding, we link its emplacement with the Late Jurassic NE-SW extensional tectonics attributed to the oblique subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate. Such two episodes of crustal extensions with magmatism reformed the crustal architecture of the SE-margin of the NCC, which considerably facilitated stress-transmission from plate-boundary to intraplate during the development of subsequent Late Mesozoic intracontinental deformations.\n               ","41":"\n                  In order to tackle the relationship between the exhumed Taiwan Orogeny and the associated sediment routing systems, new results from zircon fission track (ZFT) dating, calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, and the occurrence of the diagnostic magnetic mineral pyrrhotite in modern and ancient syn-orogenic sediments from pro-foreland basins in western Taiwan are reported. The ZFT age spectra of modern river sediments correspond well to the thermochronometric ages of exposed bedrock and indicate a rapidly exhumed source with a young ZFT peak age of 1.7 Myr in central Taiwan, which has not been widely reported. ZFT results from the Pleistocene successions show diachronous deposition of totally-reset zircons from south to north, accompanied by a trend of younging up-section. The progression of these ZFT signals in conjunction with changes in petrography and pyrrhotite occurrence suggest transient developments of sediment routing systems in central Taiwan and the importance of paleo sediment routing systems. In the Dadu River, totally-reset zircons did not appear until 1\u20130.45 Myr, when the flux of thermally mature material became prominent. The course of the Choshui river migrated during the past 1 Myr and the reorganization of the river reflects activity of frontal thrusts in Pleistocene times. Exhumation rates recorded by detrital sediments of the Choshui River catchment have been consistently higher than those of the Dadu River, suggesting inherited heterogeneity of exhumation in the orogen.\n               ","42":"\n                  The Cretaceous extensional province of the South China Block (SCB), and the decratonization-induced extension in the North China Block (NCB), were both controlled by the Late Mesozoic subduction of the Izanagi\/Paleo-Pacific Plate. Different from the metamorphic core complexes exhuming deep crustal rocks of the NCB, extension of the SCB is expressed by numerous half-graben basins and detachment of upper-middle crustal rocks, but its mode and mechanism remain unclarified. At the westernmost of this extensional province, the Early Paleozoic Yuechengling-Miao'ershan Massif, composed of the ductilely deformed Yuechengling pluton and undeformed Miao'ershan pluton, records Late Mesozoic detachment and exhumation. Magnetic fabrics of the western Yuechengling pluton are consistent with structural fabrics, while the NE-SW trending magnetic lineation and NE-SW striking magnetic foliation of the Miao'ershan pluton and the undeformed Yuechengling pluton reflect a pre-existing magma flow structure. Integrating our structural observation, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) results with gravity modeling, we reveal the deep geometry of the extensional dome and restore the original structure before the Late Mesozoic Ziyuan detachment. The mode of extension argues for a single batholith split into two separate massifs, thinning the crust of the central SCB. The shallow-dipping Ziyuan detachment fault (10\u00b0-30\u00b0) may account for the large horizontal extension but low exhumation of mid-crustal rocks in the SCB, in contrast to the large exhumation of deep crustal rocks in the NCB.\n               ","43":"\n                  We present a new 3D shear-wave velocity model and Moho map of Scandinavia, which is based on the inversion of the merged phase dispersion curves from ambient noise and earthquake-generated Rayleigh waves.

We assess the question of what compensates for the unusual high Scandes mountains and aim to identify the different tectonic domains of the adjacent continental lithosphere (Baltic Shield).\n                  While the southern Scandes lacks a pronounced crustal root, we observe a crustal root below the northern Scandes that is decreasing towards the central Scandes. A \u223c10\u00a0km thick high-density lower crustal layer is present below the northern Scandes and generally thickening to the east below the Baltic Shield. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) below the Scandes is deepening as well from west to east with a sharp step and a strong V\n                     \n                        SV\n                      decrease with depth of 9% in the north and of 5.5% in the south. The LAB of the thinner lithosphere is at 150\u00a0km depth in the north and varies from 90 to 120\u00a0km depth in the south. Both LAB steps coincide with the mountain front. The central area shows rather smoothly varying structures (170\u00a0km LAB depth, \u22124% V\n                     \n                        SV\n                      with depth) towards the east and no clear spatial match with the front. We infer therefore distinct uplift mechanisms along the Scandes. The southern Scandes might sustain their topography due to dynamic support from the mantle, while the northern Scandes experience both crustal and mantle lithosphere isostasy. In both cases, we suspect a dynamic support from small-scale edge-driven convection that developed at the sharp lithospheric steps.\n                  Beneath the Archean Karelia craton in northern Finland, we find low-velocity areas below 150\u00a0km depth while a 250\u00a0km deep lithospheric keel is imaged below the Paleoproterozic southern Finland. The Norrbotten craton in northern Sweden can be identified at mantle depths as a unit different from the Karelia craton, Scandes and Paleoproterozic central Sweden.\n               ","44":"\n                  We extracted tectonic crustal deformation caused by the interplate coupling between the Pacific and North American plates from GNSS time series data at land-based stations in the Tohoku district, northeastern Japan, during the period from 21 March 1996 to 7 March 2011. Next, we estimated the spatiotemporal distributions of the slip deficit rates between the two plates prior to the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake for the 1997\u20132010 period by performing time-dependent inversion analysis. As a result, two strongly coupled regions were identified. One is located off the coast of Iwate Prefecture, whose reliability may not be high, where coseismic slip of the Tohoku-oki earthquake was small, indicating that this area may be a source region for a future megathrust earthquake. The other is a region with strong and continuous interplate coupling of more than 8\u00a0cm\/yr from 1997 to 2010 in and around the epicenter of the Tohoku-oki earthquake. This area coincides with the area where coseismic slip greater than 20\u00a0m was estimated. Decrease of interplate coupling by approximately 0.4\u00a0cm\/yr was identified at the downdip side of the region during the period from 2003 to 2008, reaching a coupling of 1.5\u00a0cm\/yr in 2008, which would yield an increase in shear stress at its shallower strongly coupled region. We also identified that in 2010, the strongly coupled region rapidly expanded in southwestern and downdip directions. These results suggest that the shear stressing rate in the strongly coupled region might be accelerated, reaching rupture strength because of these two effects, thereby causing the main shock.\n               ","45":"\n                  While the cyclic nature of tectonic strain build-up and release is at least conceptually well understood (known as the earthquake cycle), it is not clear how variable the corresponding earthquake sizes and the time intervals between them are. Additional observations from past earthquakes are required to better constrain these aspects.\n                  In this context, we investigate the roughness of bedrock normal fault scarps along the Mt. Vettore fault and Roccapreturo fault (Italy), motivated by field observations that roughness positively correlates with profile height: higher sections of the fault surface are rougher than lower sections, ostensibly because the scarps were created by consecutive exposure events (e.g., earthquakes), exposing the higher sections for longer periods of time to subaerial weathering processes. Using high-resolution topographic models of the two fault surfaces, we calculate local roughness metrics and determine how they change as a function of profile height. In doing so, we are able to identify step-like changes in fault roughness, suggesting that the studied portions of the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo fault scarps were formed respectively by at least 6 and 4 large earthquakes, with slip increments ranging from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.7\u00a0m and corresponding magnitudes ranging from M6.1 to M6.8. Comparing our results for the Roccapreturo scarp with a previous cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) investigation at this site indicates that we were able to a) find previously identified earthquakes and b) find additional, previously unresolved ones. It appears that, during the same time interval, fault plane roughness analysis may be a more sensitive indicator of past earthquake activity on carbonate scarps than cosmogenic dating.\n               ","46":"\n                  Magnetic mineral assemblages record physical and chemical changes that occur during and after seismic events with large slips. For example, previous studies have reported that siderite, a common phase in carbonate rocks and a cement in noncarbonate rocks, breaks down to neoformed magnetite due to seismic friction or fluid related to earthquakes and high-velocity activities. Seismic magnetic mineral transformation of siderite to hematite, while also possible, is less common. Here, we present new rock magnetism and X-ray diffraction data to assess the magnetic mineral assemblage and mineral reactions along the East Yibug Chaka Fault, Tibetan Plateau. These data from well-exposed outcrops document the presence of siderite, magnetite and hematite. We show that abundant magnetite is neoformed during historic seismic fluid processes due to the breakdown of siderite at ~300\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C and that hematite forms from magnetite and siderite through subsequent interaction with interseismic fluids and\/or Earth surface weathering.\n               ","47":"\n                  The Fangshan intrusive suite is a composite pluton in the North China Craton that resulted from incremental assembly of small magma batches. The pluton consists of four intrusive units with abundant mafic enclaves. Here we clarify its crystallisation history through zircon UPb dating, which indicates prolonged crystallisation of each intrusive unit at upper-crustal levels between 132.5 and 128.7\u00a0Ma. The magmas were episodically extracted from a deep storage area and ascended to the final intrusion level at a palaeo-depth of 10\u201316\u00a0km. Zircon trace element and Hf isotopic compositions and Ti-in-zircon temperature of the four intrusive units and mafic enclaves show significant differences and suggest that their crystallisation occurred in isotopically and chemically diverse magma batches. These magma batches formed in the lower crust from the mingling and mixing of various proportions of residual melts, derived from the fractional crystallisation of mafic magmas, with crustal partial melts at high temperatures. Four type of zircons were observed in mafic enclaves based on a simple textural classification, including antecrysts (type 1), xenocrysts (type 2 and type 3), and recrystallised zircon (type 4). Type 1 zircons were not formed at the emplacement level and are \u201cantecrystic\u201d, having formed at a deeper, hotter level and been entrained into the ascending melts. Most type 2 zircons were captured from coarse-grained monzonite, and a very small number of grains were sourced from porphyritic granodiorite. Type 3 zircons display a core-rim texture, illustrating that xenocrysts may successively grow in mafic melts. Type 4 zircons display patchy zoning that represents a disequilibrium texture, manifested by the replacement of U\u2013Th\u2013REE-rich zircon by U\u2013Th\u2013REE-poor zircon, which occurred in response to magma mixing between mafic and felsic melts.

In this paper, Magnetotelluric (MT) profile data across the south-eastern CAOB and the northern margin of the NCC are explored to image the two-dimensional resistivity structure of the region. According to the resistivity model, a north-dipping conductive layer to the north of the Xilinhot fault and a south-dipping conductive layer to the south of the Linxi fault are revealed. The two conductors are interpreted as evidence of the late-stage low-angle bidirectional subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, which constrains the northern and southern deep boundaries of the Solonker Suture Zone. Another couple of mantle conductors with opposite dipping angles are revealed under the Solonker Suture Zone and Bainaimiao Belt, which are interpreted as evidence of the early-stage high-angle bidirectional subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Compared with the results from previously reported MT profiles in this area, the subduction angle becomes more gentle from west to east. The difference of convergence rate between the NCC and the Siberian Craton is considered to be the major cause of the closure difference along the strike. The northern margin of the NCC has a conductive lower crust, which may result from the magma underplating or crust-mantle decoupling, as it is imaged to be connected with the south-dipping conductive layer beneath the Solonker Suture Zone.\n               ","49":"\n                  We present the source mechanisms and rupture processes for the damaging 23 February 2020 earthquake doublet of Mw 5.8 and Mw 5.9 that occurred near the Turkish-Iranian border regions of Qotur-Goharan-Mir'Omar-Ravian (NW Iran), extending towards Saray and Ba\u015fkale (Eastern Turkey), as obtained from seismological waveform analysis and space geodesy imaging. Seismotectonic characteristics of the sequence highlight the role of indentation tectonics developed within regional-scale compressional environment where the Arabian microplate collides with the Eurasian plate. Here we report optimal finite-fault slip distribution patterns of the 2020 Qotur-Ravian earthquake doublet revealing complex co-seismic rupture propagation along the fault planes with maximum displacements ranging from 20 to 50\u00a0cm, stretching from the hypocentre to the surface. Analysis of aftershocks based on 3.5\u00a0months-long seismicity confirms distributed deformation. This energetic earthquake sequence demonstrates the distinct rupture characteristics illuminating differences in seismogenic properties and seismic hazard. Coulomb stress transfer modelling predicts triggering of the second event of Mw 5.9 by the first event of Mw 5.8. The zone of Coulomb stress changes attributed to varying pore pressure linking to geothermal water resources in the region as a driving force, may have an impact on the nucleation of triggered faulting. Evaluation of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data reveals the activated faults with evident co-seismic slip. Specifically, (1) we detected a rare case in earthquake-induced ground deformation where there is overlapping surface deformation due to sequential shallow events located closely in the crust, (2) the initial event ruptured a normal fault located towards W-NW of the latter inferred strike-slip fault and (3) the conjugate system of faults is closely placed at a few km apart.

Samples were subjected to progressive thermal (Th) and Alternating Field (AF) demagnetization for directional analyses, and representative samples were used for rock-magnetic experiments. The rock-magnetic study indicated that titano-magnetite, titano-hematite and magnetite are the primary carrier of remanent magnetization. Two components of Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) were revealed: the first, low stability component is removed by AF of 20-30mT or heating up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C. The second, high stability component isolated above these steps is directed toward the origin and considered Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM).

This damage is expected to be influenced by lithology and occur preferably on the nominally tensile side of ruptures because rocks are weaker in tension than compression. Whereas the static tensile strength of many rocks is known, our capacity to relate parameters used to quantify brittle deformation in fault damage zones commonly measured in the field, including fracture density and fragment size, to earthquake rupture conditions is poor. This is due to a lack of experimental data relating tensile strength, fracture density, and fragment size to lithology under transient loading conditions. To relate brittle damage to coseismic tensile loading conditions, we use a modified sample configuration for a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) designed to induce tensile rock fragmentation. Experiments cover a range of rock types including granite, diabase, welded tuff, and sandstone. All crystalline rocks fail predominantly via mode-I fracture, while sandstone fails through localized dilation bands, distributed pore space expansion, and less common mode-I fractures. Measurements of fracture density, fragment size, and porosity change are compared to tensile strength and strain rate at failure. We derive empirical relationships for (1) the transition from fracture to dilation banding as a function of initial porosity and (2) the strain rate dependence of tensile strength. These empirical relationships are used to estimate the rock strength during earthquake rupture on the side of the fault loaded under tension for comparison to predicted stress decay with distance from a fault to estimate the lithology dependent extent and nature of coseismic fault damage.

Based on a south\u2013north trending linear broadband seismic array, we obtained the crust and mantle structure beneath the YB and southwestern YC by P-wave and S-wave receiver functions and ambient noise tomography. Our results show a remarkable lithospheric boundary beneath the northern margin of the YB, which separates the YB with felsic thin crust and thin mantle lithosphere from the YC with both a thick crust and thick mantle lithosphere.

A 5-km-thick high-velocity layer is also found at a depth of 10\u00a0km beneath the northern YB. Combining this information with previous tectonic and geological results, we reveal the process of Mesozoic lithospheric evolution in the southwestern South China Block. We infer that both the pre-Mesozoic weak crust and mantle lithosphere and the intense intracontinental orogenesis in the Early-Middle Triassic contributed to the formation of first-stage Au deposits in the YB. Lithospheric delamination in the Early Cretaceous thinned the lithosphere of YB rather than YC, forming a steep lithosphere\u2013asthenosphere boundary beneath the transition zone between YB and YC, which favored upwelling of Au-rich asthenosphere below the thick cratonic root to the bottom of the crust in the northern YB and contributed to the second-stage Au deposits in the YB.\n               ","53":"\n                  The Western Ghats (WG), with an average elevation of ~1.2\u00a0km, is one of the greatest escarpments that spans ~1500\u00a0km parallel to the west coast of India. It is a mosaic of disparate geological formations having distinct structural and physical characteristics. In this study, the lithospheric structure in terms of crustal thickness, sub-Moho layer and deformation along and across the WG are investigated using receiver functions (RFs) at 30 broadband seismological stations. Techniques like slant stacking, common conversion point imaging and harmonic decomposition are applied to the RFs. Results reveal a large crustal thickness of ~45\u00a0km in the central part of the WG, which decreases to ~39\u00a0km in the southern and\u00a0~\u00a037\u00a0km in the northern parts, in conformity with the geology. The variation in crustal thickness beneath the WG could be due to the effect of hotspot impingement and subsequent rifting mechanism. Further, the RFs reveal a strong sub-Moho low velocity layer (LVL) along the WG. This observation gains support from a previous inference of a low-density zone in the uppermost mantle beneath the west coast of India. Harmonic decomposition of the RFs reveals that this LVL is anisotropic, while the Moho is dipping\/ anisotropic in nature. The trend of the symmetry axis of anisotropy (of the LVL) varies from 58.2\u2218 to 134.4\u2218, almost perpendicular to the west coast of India. We postulate that the origin of this LVL can be linked to different rifting episodes along the west coast of India, since LVLs are manifestations of thermal\/chemical anomalies.

We detect one or multiple negative conversions at the depth ranging from 80 to 200\u00a0km across most of the study region, which is associated with the seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) or mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD) within the lithospheric mantle.

We find that the Qilian Orogen in the western NETP overlying a thin mantle lithosphere has been significantly elevated, whereas the Longxi Basin in the eastern NETP with a thick mantle lithosphere lacks both high elevations and significant crustal thickening. It implies that the thick mantle lithosphere beneath the eastern NETP and western NCC likely prevents the plateau from invading the Longxi Basin, while the thin mantle lithosphere across the western NETP and Beishan Block favors outward growth of the Qilian Orogen.

However, the mechanisms of grain-size reduction of sheared rocks have long been debated. In this study, granitic mylonites from the Shuiyu shear zone of the Yunmengshan metamorphic core complex were sampled to investigate the mechanisms of grain-size reduction of K-feldspar during shearing in the middle crust. The mylonites are characterized by a typical microstructure of coarse-grained K-feldspar porphyroclasts surrounded by fine-grained matrix of oligoclase, K-feldspar, and quartz. Deformation temperatures are constrained from 400\u00a0\u00b0C to 550\u00a0\u00b0C, estimated using the feldspar and quartz microstructures, crystal-preferred orientation patterns of recrystallized quartz, and a two-feldspar geothermometer. Here, we show that the derivation of fine grains in the matrix from the K-feldspar porphyroclasts was accomplished via fluid-assisted subgrain rotation recrystallization. Walls of either well-organized or tangled dislocations constituted the boundaries of micron-scale subgrains along the margins of porphyroclasts. Hydrolytic weakening enhanced the dislocation motions to form subgrains. Furthermore, the subgrain rotation recrystallization promoted the replacement reaction of K-feldspar by sodium-rich fluid via increasing the areas of fluid\/grain interfaces. The newly formed oligoclase and quartz were subsequently deformed by diffusion creep.\n               ","57":"\n                  The Gulf of Trieste (GT), northeastern Adriatic, sits at the rigid edge of the Adria microplate representing the foreland of the adjoining Meso-Cenozoic External Dinarides and Southeastern Alps.

This separates the Cretaceous-Paleogene carbonates outcropping hundreds of meters on the Karst Plateau (hanging-wall) from their counterparts buried in the eastern gulf. Although the thrust has no evidence of historical and instrumental seismicity, a detailed seismic velocity field is needed to quantify reliable geometries in the foredeep, embedded in a tectonically active area where Adria is moving NNW-ward. Availability of a newly acquired marine multichannel seismic dataset, allowed us to provide the first well-constrained 3D P-wave velocity and depth model in the footwall of the Karst Thrust. Two iterative techniques, traveltime reflection tomography and depth seismic imaging, were applied on the data surveying the Dinaric foredeep. Our findings provide mean velocity values of 1700\u00a0m\/s for the Quaternary sediments, 2900\u00a0m\/s for the upper Eocene flysch turbidites, 4500\u00a0m\/s for the lower flysch, 5000\u00a0m\/s for the upper carbonates. The maximum flysch unit thickness results in about 1500\u00a0m and the top carbonates depth reaches about 1600\u00a0m below sea level, 1.7\u00a0km offshore Trieste, revealing the thrust is responsible for a minimum 1600\u20131800\u00a0m vertical throw.

In this study, we integrate geomorphological, seismic structural models based on seismic images, InSAR measurement, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, and the Slab-2 model of the subducted oceanic lithosphere to propose a series of geodetic-structural-constrained slip deficit models for tsunami hazard assessment in the northwestern Indian Ocean with a focus on Gwadar port in Pakistan.

Additionally, if the updip area of the 1945 event source region ruptured, it could amplify wave height by 0.2-1\u00a0m in the Gwadar port and generate a strong tsunami current (>2\u00a0m\/s) compared with the reference model. These new findings are crucial for seismic and tsunami hazard mitigation and preparedness in the northwestern Indian Ocean. We also demonstrate that modeled maximum tsunami wave heights based on the multibeam, SRTM15+ and GEBCO_2020 bathymetry differ by 0.2-1\u00a0m in the source and by 0.1\u20130.3\u00a0m in the far-field.

Although volcanism can be explained by wet plumes originating from the hydrous layer of the stagnant slab, previous numerical studies could not consistently explain the spatiotemporal and geochemical observations because of the neglected partial hydration of the mantle transition zone and wadsleyite\u2013olivine phase transition at the 410-km discontinuity, both of which affect the viscosity and buoyancy structures. Thus, we constructed a series of two-dimensional numerical models by considering the partial hydration of the mantle transition zone and phase transition at the 410-km discontinuity. The results showed that the wet plumes are retarded at the 410-km discontinuity by the phase transition and merge into batches forming hybrid plumes in the asthenosphere, explaining the mixing of components from the hydrous slab and mantle transition zone, evidenced by the geochemical observations. The spacing (~485\u00a0km) and elapsed time (~24 Myr) of the hybrid plumes beneath the lithosphere are consistent with the spatiotemporal observations. Furthermore, the degree of mixing of the components from the hydrous slab and mantle transition zone found in the hybrid plumes explains the spatial distribution of water in the mantle transition zone beneath Korea.\n               ","62":"","63":"\n                  The Kachchh paleo-rift basin of western India which recently experienced Mw 7.6, 26th January 2001 Bhuj earthquake, is one of the most active and vulnerable intra-cratonic zones in the world categorized as seismic zone V, i.e. having potential to produce earthquakes of intensity IX or higher. We analysed the geodetic and seismic principal strain rates to reveal the seismic hazard potential of the Kachchh paleo-rift basin. The geodetic strain rates are calculated from the reported surface motion in the region using a modified least-square inversion scheme that utilizes distance and spatial coverage dependent weight factor on the uncertainty in the plate motion to get a reliable estimate of principal strain rates and their orientations at regular grid nodes. An optimal weighting factor yields a mean rate of compression of ~\u00a0\u2212\u00a016\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 nano strain\/yr towards north-northeast in the region. The seismic strain rates are estimated based on fault plane solutions of the significant past earthquakes (Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.5) of the region using the Kostrov formulations. The seismic strain rate and stress inversion estimate indicate that the region released elastic strain at an average rate of ~\u00a0\u2212\u00a085 nano strain\/yr towards north-south in the past 350\u00a0years. A composite analysis of the geodetic and seismic strain rates indicates 900\u20133000\u00a0years of recurrence interval of major (Mw 7.8\u20138) earthquakes in the region.

Its deep structural features and formation mechanism have long been a topical area of deep geophysical research. This study presents a magnetotelluric profile that extends from the Dongwuqi to Tongliao in Inner Mongolia and passes through geological structures such as the NSGL. Dimensional analysis of the profile data reveals good overall 2D features. 2D nonlinear conjugate gradient inversion of the profile data produced a model of the deep electrical structure. Horizontally, the electrical structure along the profile displays different characteristics in different blocks. The NSGL serves as a boundary for the change in the depth of the Moho discontinuity. Specifically, the Moho discontinuity is deep on the west side of the NSGL and shallow on its east side. Overall, the thickness of the lithosphere varies nonsignificantly, except in the western part of the profile, where the presence of a large low-resistivity anomaly in the shallow layer obscures the boundary of the lithosphere. The large high-resistivity anomaly in the center of the profile may be an indication that the partial delamination of the lithosphere caused by the convection of mantle materials and the upwelling of high-density mantle materials under the action of the westward subduction of the Pacific plate were the major causes of large positive gravity anomalies on the east side of the NSGL. The west side of the NSGL was predominantly controlled by the closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean, resulting in an increase in the thickness of the crust, which led to the formation of large negative gravity anomalies. These two factors collectively led to the formation of the NSGL.\n               ","65":"\n                  The North Luzon Trough, on the East Asian continental margin, is under transpression due to the oblique convergence between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Based on a seismic profile across the Manila subduction system and other geological data, we propose a strike-slip pull-apart basin model to account for the formation of the North Luzon Forearc Basin. The subduction system experienced four tectonic evolutionary stages: (1) initial subduction (~22\u201320\u00a0Ma): the Eurasian Plate began to subduct beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, and the incipient Manila Trench-North Luzon Volcanic Arc system started to form; (2) upper crustal deformation (~20\u201315\u00a0Ma): the overriding Philippine Sea Plate was strongly deformed by continuous subduction, and thrust faults, volcanic activity, and possibly strike-slip faulting weakened the forearc areas; (3) initiation of strike-slip faults (~15\u20136\u00a0Ma): continuous rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate initiated strike-slip faults in the weak zones of the forearc areas; (4) pull-apart basin formation (~6\u20130\u00a0Ma): the pull-apart basin formed in the forearc due to sinistral movement of two sets of strike-slip faults. We propose an indentation-escape process involving coupling between the sinistral strike-slip faults in the Taiwan-Luzon area and dextral strike-slip faults in the East Asia continental margin, for the evolution of the eastern South China Sea Basin margin.\n               ","66":"\n                  Basement structure beneath the Pennsylvanian portion of the Appalachian basin, where some of the deepest basement in the basin is found, is investigated by constructing a map of the Precambrian unconformity using 3939 new point estimates of basement depth determined from seismic reflection profiles and P-wave receiver functions, combined with geophysical and well log data used in other published basement maps. The map shows a gradual and uniform deepening of the basement from depths of ~1500\u00a0m in the northwest to ~6000\u00a0m in the southeast, consistent with a foreland basin plate flexure model. However, basement depths in two regions, when compared to depths predicted by a plate flexure model, show basin over-deepening. One to two km of over-deepening coincides with the Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic Rome Trough in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the Northumberland Deep Basement Zone (NDBZ) in east-central Pennsylvania shows two to two and a half km of over-deepening. Basin over-deepening in the Rome Trough does not extend into northern Pennsylvania, pointing to a termination of the trough within central Pennsylvania. The origin of basin over-deepening in the NDBZ is less certain but overlaps spatially with the southern portion of the Neoproterozoic Scranton Rift. The preservation of one or more failed Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic rifts within the basement structure of the Appalachian Basin suggests crystalline basement was not significantly deformed by the Paleozoic orogenic events associated with basin formation. It also supports models placing the locus of Laurentian rifting from Rodinia well to the east of the Appalachian Basin.\n               ","67":"\n                  Ever since the Mesozoic era, the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) has been significantly affected by the subduction of the Pacific plate. In order to better understand the subduction effect of the Pacific plate at different distances, we set up 65 magnetotelluric stations to acquire a three-dimensional inversion resistivity structure. The results illustrate that: there are three large-scale high-conductivity anomalies C1, C2 and C3 affecting the crust and mantle of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The high-conductivity anomaly C1 extends from the surface to the asthenosphere and is connected with C2, which exists in the asthenosphere below the Xing'an block. The high-conductivity anomaly C3 under the Songliao block extends downward from the surface to the asthenosphere. We interpret that these anomalies are caused by aqueous fluid and partial melting based on petrophysical analysis. In the light of the high-temperature high-pressure theory, the estimated water content and melting fraction of C3 is considerably higher than that of C2. We infer that the lateral heterogeneity of the fluid-related properties is caused by the variable distance to the Western Pacific subduction zone. The C3 anomaly is located above the stagnant plate and controlled by the medium-distance effects of Pacific plate subduction, which have been influenced by intense dehydration and seriously transforming. The C2 anomaly is located at the end of the stagnant plate and controlled by the long-distance effects of Pacific plate subduction with slight dehydration and transformation.\n               ","68":"\n                  The link between major basement anisotropies and basin evolution is crucial for understanding the role of tectonic inheritance on continental margins. However, it is still a matter of debate how and why it happens, especially in the Equatorial Atlantic, where the interplay between Precambrian fabric and the shearing of major oceanic fractures has been studied. Here, we investigate the offshore Cear\u00e1 Basin and its basement in the central part of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin to (1) map basement anisotropies underneath marginal basins and show how Precambrian crustal domains influenced basin evolution; (2) determine the deformation style of reactivated basement faults; and (3) assess the interplay between reactivated faults and the oceanic Romanche Fracture Zone. The combined geological and geophysical data show that reactivation of NE-SW to ENE-WSW continental-scale ductile shear zones that acted as crustal weakness zones started in the Early Cretaceous under a normal stress field. Stress field inversion occurred in the Barremian during the continental breakup when the South American plate started to became an independent intraplate area under a strike-slip stress regimes. The shear zones arrest at the E-W-striking Romanche Fracture Zone, which marks the continental-oceanic boundary. The major fault offsets occurred along the Transbrasiliano Shear Zone, which represented a collisional boundary between paleocontinents in the Neoproterozoic. Fault reactivation also occurred in the eastern boundary of the Cear\u00e1 Terrace marginal ridge along the Transbrasiliano Shear Zone, uplifted during tectonic inversion. We conclude that fault reactivation mainly occurred between contrasting Precambrian terrains separated by ductile shear zones. Additionally, the folds associated with the Romanche Fracture Zone were mainly generated along reactivated faults that affected syn- to postrift units on the Equatorial Margin.\n               ","69":"\n                  It is well known that the Tibetan plateau exposes a series of terranes that were drifted northward and accreted progressively onto the south margin of Eurasia resulting from ocean closure. However, the processes associated with the ocean closure remains poorly unconstrained. One such issue is whether the demise of the Bangong-Nujiang ocean between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes were caused by northward subduction only or both northward and southward subduction. To address this issue, we analyze high-resolution seismic reflection data along a 275-km north-south traverse across the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone. Our work shows that the Moho of the Lhasa terrane lies at 22.5\u00a0s (two-way travel time) and the Moho of the Qiangtang terrane lies at 20\u00a0s. In the Lhasa terrane, the reflection profile reveals an X-shaped structure that segmented south-dipping reflectors are truncated by continuous north-dipping reflectors. Based on the existing geological and geophysical observations and the cross-cutting relationships among seismic reflectors, we propose that the fossil relics of south-dipping reflectors with relatively weak amplitude in Lhasa terrane were created by the Mesozoic southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang ocean, and the north-dipping reflectors were triggered by the younger Cenozoic deformation during the India-Asia collision. In the Qiangtang terrane, our seismic reflection profile displays an antiformal structure with a set of north-dipping reflections in the lower crust, which we interpret as triggered by the northward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang ocean. The structures as revealed by our seismic observations as a whole indicate that the closure of the Bangong-Nujiang ocean was created by bidirectional oceanic subduction.\n               ","70":"\n                  The lithosphere beneath the Zagros and central Iran has sustained long-lasting Neo-Tethyan subduction and subsequent collisional orogenesis, leading to the complicated crustal and lithospheric structure beneath the Iranian plateau. To better understand the geotectonic and geodynamic evolution of the Iranian plateau, we estimate the shear-wave velocity structure along profiles perpendicular to the Zagros using a self-parameterized Bayesian inversion of the Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves in the period range of 5 to 120\u00a0s. Our velocity models, in line with a segmented slab model, show that different geodynamic processes have dominated along the Zagros. In the northern Zagros, the thick and high-velocity lithosphere beneath the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) and Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) is abruptly separated from the low-velocity lithosphere beneath central Iran, while the high-velocity anomaly underlies the UDMA and central Iran in the central and southern Zagros. We propose that the Arabian lithosphere near the suture has probably experienced a distributed thickening in the northern Zagros, and it underthrusts beneath central Iran in the central and southern Zagros. In the central and southern Zagros, a high-velocity anomaly elongates at a depth of 80\u2013120\u00a0km between the low-velocity lithospheres of the UDMA and Lut block. This suggests that flat-slab subduction has not extended to the east of the Iranian plateau, therefore, the Eocene-Oligocene flare-up magmatism in the Lut block may be directly independent of the Neo-Tethys subduction. This study suggests that lateral tearing might be responsible for the slab detachment beneath the central and southern Zagros. The slab lithosphere may have started to tear from beneath the central UDMA and have propagated to the edges since ~10\u00a0Ma. Furthermore, the southeasternmost Zagros in the vicinity of the Makran zone, as a corner continental collision, has probably experienced slab tearing and break off during the Middle-Late Miocene.\n               ","71":"\n                  Chlorite is a common, but understudied phyllosilicate mineral along continental and subduction zone faults. To understand the potential role of chlorite in different modes of fault slip, we measure the constitutive frictional properties of chlorite at low rates of deformation and shallow hydrothermal conditions by shearing powdered samples of water-saturated chlorite in the triaxial saw-cut configuration. Experiments were conducted at 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C, 130\u00a0MPa confining pressure, pore pressures from 10\u00a0MPa to 120\u00a0MPa, slip rates from 0.001 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, and shear displacements up to 7.5\u00a0mm. The frictional strength of chlorite increases with increasing temperature from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.4 to 0.46), accompanied by an increased abundance of Riedel shears. Chlorite also transitions from rate-strengthening behavior at fast slip rates (0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) to rate-weakening or rate-neutral behavior at lower slip rates (0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), consistent with one hypothesis for the cause of slow slip. This transition in frictional behavior reflects different microphysical processes controlling the direct and evolution effects of friction. At low deformation rates, the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of the direct effect (a) are consistent with subcritical fracture. In contrast, the evolution effect (b) is insensitive to temperature and increases systematically with decreasing strain rate. We propose the increase in b and resulting rate-weakening behavior of chlorite with decreasing slip rate is controlled by time-dependent properties of adsorbed water to mineral surfaces.\n               ","72":"\n                  The Chuan-Dian block is one of the most seismically active regions in China.

These aftershocks started from NE of the mainshock, then bilaterally expanded towards SE and NW directions, and eventually activated a SE-trending complex fault structure with ~18\u00a0km length. We also use a waveform-based inversion algorithm to calculate the focal mechanisms of the mainshock and its relatively large aftershocks, resulting in four predominantly normal-faulting events and seven strike-slip events, which further illuminate the 2013 Eryuan sequence was accommodated by a strike-slip fault system separated by extensional stepover zones.

For example, deepwater drilling has shown the old age of the oceanic crust and its inhomogeneous composition. Seismic studies of long-range profiles with nuclear explosions and laboratory studies of mantle xenoliths at high pressures and temperatures have revealed that the advection of energy-intensive and geochemically active deep fluids is central to the formation of the upper mantle structure. A comprehensive analysis of these data provides a geodynamic model for the natural transformation of the upper mantle substance influenced by deep fluids and the formation of continents and oceans as a result of unevenly distributed degassing of the Earth. The global variability of the deep fluid advection intensity led to formation of two hemispheres: the Indo Atlantic Hemisphere where almost all continents are located and the Pacific Hemisphere that consists of oceans. This formation of the hemispheres can be explained by the specific features of the Earth's rotation in the Earth-Moon-Sun system.

Based on its multiple-ring structure, structural distinction from surrounding regional structural trends, occurrence of a central quiet magnetic zone, an underlying shallower Moho and radial faults associated with magnetic bodies, we suggest the Deniliquin multiple-ring feature may represent the deep seated root zone of a large impact structure.\n               ","75":"\n                  More and more supershear rupture earthquakes, with rupture propagation velocity larger than the local shear wave speed, have been identified in recent years.

In this study, we utilize finite element method to simulate spontaneous dynamic rupture propagations in three dimensional half-space model with and without velocity strengthening friction layer (VSFL) near the Earth's free surface employing different frictional constitutive relations, including linear slip weakening law and rate- and state-dependent relations with aging form and slip form. The simulated results showed that the VSFL suppresses supershear rupture transition at the Earth's free surface occurring in the absence of a VSFL. In particular, we found that the minimum thickness of VSFL to prevent supershear rupture transition is ~1.4-km. Meanwhile, we reviewed a great deal of previous work on thickness of VSFL along mature faults in nature, and its thickness generally exceeds ~3-km, which is enough to suppress the transition to supershear rupture in the real-world. The presence of VSFL may be the primary reason why the supershear rupture earthquakes in nature are so scarce. In addition, the modelling results indicated that spatial heterogeneity of VSFL on the surface along fault strike affects the supershear rupture transition to some extent.

The sedimentary thickness changes mainly from 3\u00a0km to 4\u00a0km, and the average crustal thickness is ~42.4\u00a0km in the anticline area, while sedimentary thickness varies mainly from 4\u00a0km to 5\u00a0km and the average crustal thickness is ~41.0\u00a0km in the syncline area. These results suggest that the Weiyuan anticline should be a thin-skinned structure and that the study region maintains a typical cratonic structure in the crust. The observed 1\u20132\u00a0km-thick low-velocity layer at depths of 3\u20134\u00a0km in the syncline area may be related to Ordovician and Silurian shale gas strata with high porosity and low density. The observed characteristics of alternating high\u2212\/low-velocity layers and long-term hydraulic fracturing and water injection may have induced the occurrence of ML\u00a0>\u00a04.0 earthquakes in the Weiyuan shale gas field since 2018. Our study suggests that dense temporary seismic data can not only delineate small-scale structural characteristics but also provide valuable references for oil-gas exploration and earthquake mitigation.\n               ","78":"\n                  The Yalahe Fault (YLHF) is a sub-strand of the Xianshuihe Fault Zone (XSHF) that plays an important role in understanding the structural deformation pattern of the Kangding segment and analyzing the seismic hazards in this area. However, little is known regarding the recurrence patterns and characteristics of large earthquakes along the YLHF. We reveal six recent paleoearthquake events on the YLHF using tectonic geomorphology, trench excavations, and radiocarbon dating. The six events, E6\u2013E1, are constrained to have occurred during (from oldest to youngest, respectively) 20,975\u201320,749, 18,981\u201318,817, 10,437\u201310,252, 7168\u20136269, 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, and after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE. The most recent event may correspond to the 1700\u00a0CE\u00a0~\u00a0M 7 earthquake. The average recurrence interval was 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene, and the coefficient of variation was 0.13, indicating that the YLHF follows a quasiperiodic recurrence model. The YLHF may experience cascading ruptures with two adjacent faults (Selaha and Zheduotang). The range of activity was located north of Huiyuan Temple and south of Jingai. Deformed strata show that the YLHF is kinematically characterized by transtension. In addition, the YLHF accumulated parts of the slip rate of the single-stranded XSHF. Therefore, the YLHF plays a significant role in the tectonic deformation of the XSHF in the Kangding segment with a high seismic hazard.\n               ","79":"\n                  The formation of high topography on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (the Qilian Shan) constrains the evolutionary history of the plateau. Although prominent exhumation occurred in the middle\u2013late Miocene, the time at which deformation and relief development began in the Qilian Shan during the Cenozoic remains highly debated. Here, we use low-temperature thermochronology to reveal the histories of topographic growth in the Qilian Shan. Two transects were sampled in two primary thrust belts (Qaidam Shan and Danghenan Shan) in the southern Qilian Shan. New apatite fission track ages range from 16.6 to 113\u00a0Ma, and apatite (U-Th)\/He ages range from 8.4 to 63.5\u00a0Ma. Age\u2013elevation relationships and thermal modeling show enhanced rock exhumation in the late Paleocene\u2013early Eocene and middle\u2013late Miocene in both transects. The results indicate two pulses of enhanced thrusting on the major thrust belts in the southern Qilian Shan in the late Paleocene\u2013early Eocene and middle\u2013late Miocene. Our findings imply an early Cenozoic onset of topographic growth in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, which was quasi-synchronous with the India\u2013Asia collision.\n               ","80":"\n                  The 85\u00b0E Ridge is a prominent linear structure in the northeastern Indian Ocean. Its nature and origin are still controversial due to the coverage of thick Bengal Fan sediments. Here we present a newly collected 400-km-long 2-D seismic reflection profile which crosses the 85\u00b0E Ridge near 11\u00b0N and shows the basement morphology and internal structures of the ridge. The ridge has a thickened crust characterized by two basement highs rising up to ~2\u20133\u00a0km above the surrounding oceanic crust and a Moho depression with amplitude of ~3\u20134\u00a0km. Typical volcanic structures formed by hotspot volcanism are identified in the ridge. Deep-rooted faults played important roles in the formation of the 85\u00b0E Ridge. They acted as the preferred conduit for the upwelling of hotspot melts, but their syn- and post-volcanic reactivations induced the collapse of volcanic sequences and the relative uplift of the East Ridge. These observations support that the 85\u00b0E Ridge near 11\u00b0N having formed by hotspot magmatism drained along a leaky fracture zone. Combined with previous results, a new single-hotspot formation model of the 85\u00b0E Ridge is proposed, in which the entire 85\u00b0E Ridge was formed by a weak and pulsating mantle plume acting on the northward drifting Indian Plate. Its along-strike variations in location, morphology, and structure in different segments are interpreted to reflect different elastic strength of the oceanic lithosphere and the existence of a pre-existing fracture zone which laterally redistributed the shallow melts.\n               ","81":"\n                  Since early 2019, the InSight mission has proven that Mars is seismically active, with more than 900 seismic events recorded. Among them, several events have characteristics close to terrestrial tectonic earthquakes. Most of these events are located on the major graben system of Cerberus fossae and, a little further north, on the secondary system of Grjot\u00e1 Valles. In this study, we invert the seismic moment tensors for nine of these tectonic marsquakes characterized by high quality data. Seven of them are located on Cerberus fossae\/Grjot\u00e1 Valles and two of them are located near the Martian dichotomy. The moment tensors allow us to interpret the nature and depth of the seismic sources at the origin of these events. In our approach, we invert the P and S body waveforms, the PP, SS, PPP and SSS secondary phase maximum amplitudes and we look for solutions with surface waves weaker than the Martian noise. From our results on moment tensors, we determine that all our events have been triggered at moderate depths of 15\u201336km. We deduce that the seven events located on Cerberus fossae have geometries similar to the fractures and are generated by tectonics. This activity is supposed to result from the reactivation of previous faults and fractures, which would have been initially induced by the propagation of volcanic dikes at depth. The two dichotomy events are due to deep compressive fracturing of the Martian lowlands. They are therefore triggered by the planetary thermal contraction. Our results are in strong agreement with recent studies on the event depths and on the previous moment tensors calculated for two events.\n               ","82":"\n                  The India-Asia collision processes are under current debate, mainly due to the large variations of the pre-collision position of the southern margin of Asia, in the range of 10\u201330\u00b0N. To resolve this uncertainty, we report new paleomagnetic data of the Xigaze forearc basin sediments from the Zhongba Cuojiangding area. Characteristic remanent magnetizations (ChRMs) were obtained from the upper Cretaceous Qubeiya Formation (Fm) and the early Eocene Jialazi Fm. Both mean directions passed the fold test and also passed the reversal test. An elongation-inclination analysis for all the Jialazi Fm ChRM directions yielded an unflattened mean inclination of 41.6\u00b0, with 95% confidence limits between 36.0\u00b0 and 49.0\u00b0 (f\u00a0=\u00a00.76), consistent with the Qubeiya Fm results. The overall mean direction for the Qubeiya Fm is D\u00a0=\u00a0334.8\u00b0, I\u00a0=\u00a042.7\u00b0, k\u00a0=\u00a011.8, \u03b195\u00a0=\u00a06.7\u00b0, n\u00a0=\u00a042 in stratigraphic coordinates, corresponding to a paleolatitude of 24.8\u00b0N and a paleopole at 67.1\u00b0N, 347.5\u00b0E with A95\u00a0=\u00a07.1\u00b0. The tilt-corrected mean direction, combined with published data, for the Jialazi Fm is D\u00a0=\u00a0340.5\u00b0, I\u00a0=\u00a041.6\u00b0, k\u00a0=\u00a08.7, \u03b195\u00a0=\u00a05.2\u00b0, n\u00a0=\u00a087, corresponding to a paleolatitude of 23.9\u00b0N and a paleopole at 71.6\u00b0N, 340.0\u00b0E with A95\u00a0=\u00a05.0\u00b0.

Seismicity in the southeastern Sichuan basin increased dramatically in recent years, including a series of moderate to strong earthquakes. We investigate seismic anisotropy in the upper crust by performing shear wave splitting analyses on local earthquakes recorded at seventeen stations around the Changning-Xingwen area, southeastern Sichuan basin between January 2016\u2013February 2021. We perform an automatic shear wave splitting analysis and obtain 2926 high-quality splitting measurements by examining 5174 local earthquakes. The delay times range between 0.08 and 0.20\u00a0s, and the anisotropy magnitude ranges between 1.9% and 5.5% with a mean of 4.2%, indicating that the study area has significant strength of anisotropy. The fast polarization directions are highly variable reflecting a combined effect of complex local structure and stress field in this area. In the southeastern part of the study area, fast directions are aligned parallel to NW- and NE-oriented surface structures, suggesting structural anisotropy. In the northwestern part of the study area, fast-polarization directions align parallel to the strike of folds and the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress, probably reflecting the combination of both stress- and structural-controlled anisotropy. Whereas at these stations of central part, fast directions tend to align parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress, suggesting stress-induced anisotropy. We examined the temporal variation of seismic anisotropy associated with the 2019 M\n                     S 6.0 Changning earthquake. The significant changes in splitting parameters during the Changning earthquake period may only reflect the spatial changes in seismic anisotropy.\n               ","84":"\n                  The 1928\u00a0CE volcanic activity on eastern Etna, Italy, produced wide surface deformation and high effusion rates along fissures, with excess volumes of about 50 million m3 of lavas. This, in conjunction with the low elevation of the main eruptive vents (1150\u00a0m\u00a0a.s.l.), caused the destruction of the Mascali town. Our research focuses on a multidisciplinary study from field observations and Finite Element Method modelling through COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae, with the aim of reconstructing the geometry, kinematics and origin of the system of faults and fissures formed during the 1928 event. We collected quantitative measurements from 438 sites of azimuth values, opening direction and aperture amount of dry fissures, and attitude and vertical offsets of faults. From west to east, four volcanotectonic settings have been identified, related to dike propagation in the same direction: 1) a sequence of 8 eruptive vents, surrounded by a 385-m wide graben, 2) a 2.5-km long single eruptive fissure, 3) a half-graben as wide as 74\u00a0m and a symmetric, 39-m-wide graben without evidence of eruption, 4) alignment of lower vents along the pre-existing Ripe della Naca faults. Field data, along with historical aerial photos, became inputs to FEM numerical models. The latter allowed us to investigate the connection between diking and surface deformation during the 1928 event, subject to a range of overpressure values (1\u201320\u00a0MPa), host rock properties (1\u201330\u00a0GPa) and geometrical complexity (stratigraphic sequence, layer thickness). In addition, we studied the distribution of tensile and shear stresses above the dike tip and gained insights into dike-induced graben scenarios. Our multidisciplinary study reports that soft (e.g. tuff) layers can act as temporary stress barriers and control the surface deformation scenarios (dike-induced graben, single fracture or eruptive fissures) above a propagating dike by suppressing the distribution of shear stresses towards the surface.\n               ","85":"\n                  One major critical issue in seismic hazard analysis deals with the computation of the maximum earthquake magnitude expected for a given region. Its estimation is usually based on the analysis of past seismicity that is incomplete by definition, or derived from the dimension of faults through empirical relationships with the intrinsic uncertainty in source characterization. Here, we propose a workflow aimed at providing a time-independent estimate for the maximum possible magnitude based on geological and geophysical evidence. Our estimate is also source unrelated as it is constrained by the seismic brittle volume of the crust that scales with the effective seismic energy. The seismic brittle volume is calculated considering fault kinematics and rock rheology (i.e., the brittle-ductile transition depth) over a grid that covers the entire study area. The maximum earthquake magnitude is calculated at each point of the grid based on a volume\/magnitude empirical relationship. We apply this model to Italy for which we propose a map of the maximum possible magnitudes. Maximum predicted magnitudes are 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for thrust faulting, 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 for normal faulting and 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 for strike-slip faulting (\u00b1 deviation from the mean value calculated at each node). These magnitudes are locally higher than the historical record. This could be due to an overestimation of the involved volumes; smaller volumes and lower magnitudes may occur where faults are detached at decollements shallower than the brittle ductile transition or where they behave aseismically. Alternatively, strong or major earthquakes could be possible, but they have longer recurrence time and they have never been recorded yet in Italy. Regardless these values are fully reliable or not, the recurrence of earthquakes with the predicted magnitude is related to current strain rates. We conclude that a large part of the Italian territory is prone to trigger Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 earthquakes.\n               ","86":"\n                  We analyzed a set of 11 slow slip events occurred during the 2006\u20132016 period and affecting the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) stations of the unstable flank of Mt. Etna volcano. Observed surface deformation for most of the detected slow slip events, concentrates on the south-eastern edge of the unstable flank while the slow slip events involving the north-eastern edge are less frequent. Such a pattern highlights the existence of two distinct families of events, involving two contiguous sectors of the unstable flank, which occasionally slip together in large slow slip events. The modelled slips also highlight that both contiguous sectors extend ~10\u201312\u00a0km offshore, on areas where active tectonic lineaments such as the ESE (northward of Catania Canyon) and the N102\u00b0 (along the southern slope of the Riposto Ridge) ones have been recently discovered. Equivalent seismic moments of slow slip events occurred in the last ten years (corresponding to magnitudes in the range 5.4\u20135.9) are larger than those associated to seismic events observed in the last 200\u00a0years, suggesting that most of the deformation affecting the eastern flank occurs aseismically.\n               ","87":"\n                  The Mongolian Plateau located between the Siberian Craton and the North China Craton developed after multiple tectonic evolutions. It is proposed to be related to the far-field effect of the Indo-Asian collision in the Cenozoic. In this study, we inverted for high-resolution S wave velocity structures of Mongolia using Rayleigh wave tomography to constrain the plateau evolution. In particular, we obtained crustal and upper mantle seismic structures under Gobi Desert by combining Mongolian and Chinese datasets. The study reveals strong low-velocity anomalies in the lower crust immediately beneath the Hangay Dome, while the low-velocity zones are imaged beneath the dome margins in the upper mantle. The results imply that the Hangay Dome was formed by mantle upwelling into the crust from major faults following lithospheric delamination. Under the South Gobi Desert, we imaged several inclined high-velocity patches in the upper mantle, indicating the subducted slabs formed in the Paleozoic.

Here, using both high-rate GNSS and free-field strong motion data, we first estimated the coseismic source model. The locations of high PGV were inferred to explain the unexpected distribution of damaged buildings approximately 25\u201330\u00a0km west of the epicenter. Then, the aseismic surface displacements during the earthquake was differentiated using the coseismic source model. The aseismic extension of 3.8 \u03bcstrain is inferred at the unexpectedly large uplift region. Combining with local geology, residual gravity anomaly, seismic tomography, interseismic leveling vertical velocities, coseismic leveling uplifts and proposed Coulomb stress changes, the accelerated mud diapirism during the earthquake triggered by slip on the deep seismogenic fault was identified as the cause of unexpectedly large coseismic uplift.\n               ","89":"\n                  The geoid over the north Indian Ocean has a significantly large negative amplitude, even if the excess flattening of the Earth beyond its equilibrium shape is considered.

In this study, we identified model-independent features in the mantle beneath the Indian Ocean and Ross Sea region by analyzing eight recent global tomographic models. We standardized each of the models and applied cluster analysis to regionalize geophysically significant features in various depth ranges. These regionalizations are compared grid-by-grid to construct vote-maps. They highlight the anomalous features consistent across models and their approximate dimensions.

High velocity anomalies are most likely subducted slabs while low velocity anomalies could be partial melts generated by hydration of mantle. Additionally, a consistent low velocity structure is seen throughout the mantle beneath the southwestern Indian Ocean and east Africa. It is mostly likely a plume rising from the African LLSVP. It connects to the probable partial melts beneath the Indian Ocean via a remnant trail. Forward modelling of the geoid using vote-maps reveals that the E-W extent of the Indian Ocean Geoid Low is precisely reproduced by the consistent low velocity anomalies in the upper mantle. However, the N-S extent, most likely dependent on lower mantle anomalies, is not expressed since the dimension, orientation and dV\n                        S\n                      characteristics of high velocity structures are inconsistent in different models.

The structural analyses of fractures, dikes, and folds allow recognition of the occurrence of four different strain partitions (SP1-SP4) developed during the Lower to Middle Jurassic. Recognized strain configurations show equivalent temporal and structural relationships throughout the Jurassic back-arc system of Patagonia and contemporary basins of southern South America. The stratigraphical criteria allow inferring an Upper Sinemurian to Lower Pliensbachian time interval for the initial strain configurations (SP1, SP2, and SP3). WNW, NNE, and NE-oriented extensional phases were defined and correlated with adjoining areas. Particularly, the third strain partition phase is characterized by a significant transpressive deformation. A NE contractional episode characterizes the post-eruptive deformation stage (SP4) during the Bajocian to Callovian interval.

Several studies suggested that the mechanisms might, at least in part, lurk in the mantle, but little consensus was reached on its pattern and contributions to the surface topography. Geophysical and geodynamical studies indicated that the viscous stresses exerted by mantle flow can maintain a substantial proportion of topography and gravity anomaly, resulting in a high long-wavelength free-air admittance and dynamic topography. These two estimates are commonly used as indicators to detect mantle flow. In this study, we provided evidence for mapping mantle flow beneath western Mongolia by lithospheric flexure analysis in terms of the relationship between gravity anomaly and topography. Our results show a significant dynamic topography of an amplitude over 500\u00a0m and a high long-wavelength free-air admittance of value over 35 mGal\/km in the southwestern part of western Mongolia, leading to a reliable argument for mantle upwelling beneath western Gobi Altai. We also reveal that the long-wavelength free-air admittance deviates from lithospheric flexure isostasy in the Hangai Dome. Combined with other studies, we infer that horizontal flow fed by the upwelling from western Gobi Altai supports the Hangai Dome uplift.

This deformation is superimposed on Paleozoic fault-bounded basins on a substrate of Caledonian nappes. The latter contains multilevel crustal-scale shear systems that domed under the Utsira High during the Devonian, as indicated by mapping and interpretation of a large long-offset 2D seismic reflection dataset. Restorations show that isostatically driven doming from excision of overthickened crust caused uplift and erosion of basins and the underlying nappe stack. Doming took place above a crustal rollback system as a symmetrical metamorphic core complex formed. The dome discloses vertical flattening kinematics below bi-directional shear systems, evident by opposite shear-fabric kinematics on opposite dome flanks. A major detachment marks the upper boundary of a transition between upper and lower plate strain regimes, coinciding with low-reflective granitic units above strongly reflective Caledonian nappes.

In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction of a subsurface laccolithic intrusion through the structural reconstruction of a well-exposed dome at Pampa Amarilla, Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, southern Mendoza province, Argentina. The 3D reconstruction was made possible by the unique integration of surface geological data and subsurface 3D seismic and borehole data. We estimate that the Pampa Amarilla laccolith is ~400\u00a0m thick, ~3\u00a0km and 2\u00a0km long in the E-W and N-S directions, respectively. Along an E-W cross section, the laccolith exhibits a wedge shape with maximum thickness near its western edge and gradual thinning toward the east. The structure of the dome is typical of a trapdoor, with faulting along the western, northwestern and southwestern edges, and tilting of the overburden to the east. The trapdoor tilting of the laccolith's overburden was the main mechanism controlling the thickening and growth of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith, which exhibits a relatively high thickness-to-length ratio T\/D\u00a0~\u00a00.13. Numerous laccolithic intrusions exhibit similar values of T\/D, and our study suggests that faulting commonly controls emplacement of laccoliths with T\/D\u00a0>\u00a00.1; conversely, our study suggests that the established mechanical models of laccolith emplacement based on elastic bending of the overburden applies only to thin laccoliths.

In this paper, we conduct comprehensive petrological, geochemical, isotopic and zircon trace element analyses for two representative calderas (Shiniushan and Yunshan) to reveal the crystal-melt segregation and magma recharge processes of the Daiyunshan volcanic field. Systematic LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating and isotope analyses reveal that the porphyritic quartz monzonite, porphyritic granite and rhyolite of the Shiniushan caldera have identical crystallization ages (97\u201394\u00a0Ma) and consistent Nd-Hf isotope compositions [\u03b5\n                     Nd(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.6 to \u22122.8; zircon \u03b5\n                     Hf(t)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.7 to 1.8], which are consistent with those of the porphyritic quartz monzonite and rhyolites in the nearby Yunshan caldera, indicating that the magmas of the two calderas were derived from a common magma source region. Volcanic-plutonic rocks from two calderas display metaluminous to peraluminous features and have low MgO, FeOT, Ni and Cr contents. We thus suggest that their parental magmas were derived by remelting of pre-existing crust with contributions of juvenile components. The Shiniushan porphyritic granite and rhyolite and the Yunshan rhyolites are characterized by distinctly negative Eu anomalies and depletions of Ba, Sr, P and Ti, while the porphyritic quartz monzonites from both calderas show complementary geochemical signatures, such as positive Ba anomalies and neglectable Eu anomalies. The back-scattered electron (BSE) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) phase mapping of the Shiniushan porphyritic quartz monzonite reveal textural indicators of crystal accumulation, such as imbrication and synneusis of plagioclase phenocrysts. Their interstitial assemblages of K-feldspar, quartz and plagioclase commonly resemble the phenocryst assemblages of porphyritic granite. We believe that the Shiniushan porphyritic granite and rhyolite and Yunshan rhyolites represent extracted melts from the mush reservoir, while porphyritic quartz monzonites in both calderas are inherent cumulates that have lost interstitial melts. Therefore, our study shows that the Late Cretaceous volcanic-plutonic rocks in the Daiyunshan volcanic field should be connected by crystal-melt segregation processes. Furthermore, a typical zigzag variation in zircon \u03b5\n                     Hf(t) values is shown by the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous volcanic-plutonic rocks from the Daiyunshan volcanic field, indicating variable contributions of asthenospheric mantle-derived melts and the multistage slab rollback of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate beneath SE China.\n               ","96":"\n                  Arclogites are an important part of the continental arc root architecture. When overlooked, the crustal structure could be misinterpreted, assuming that the seismically defined Moho necessarily coincides with the crust-mantle boundary. Evaluating the possible presence of lower crustal rocks below the seismic Moho with physical properties resembling those of the underlying mantle, is therefore, of major importance. Through a multi-approach receiver function assessment, which includes shear wave velocity inversion, and determination of plausible crustal seismic velocity distributions from forward modeling, we present new constraints on the seismic structure of the arc root beneath the Colombian Andes magmatic arc. Results suggest a high-velocity arc root with a latitudinally variable thickness, from 13.5 to 20\u00a0km. The arc root is composed of a 4 to 6\u00a0km thick upper domain with seismic wave speeds 5% slower, and 8.5 to 14\u00a0km thick lower domain 5% faster, relative to the underlying uppermost mantle. This lower crustal structure, coupled with documented garnet pyroxenitic xenoliths, supports an arclogite nature for the Colombian Andes arc root.\n               ","97":"\n                  Surface processes and sediments have been suggested to play a crucial role in subduction initiation and to speed up subduction and plate tectonics. The exact roles of sediments and surface processes and the way they influence slab retreat dynamics has however not been constrained yet. Here, we analyse these roles by using 3D numerical thermo-mechanical modelling code coupled to surface processes model in order to investigate large scale dynamics of retreating subduction zones. We focus on two regional-scale geodynamic scenarios: a slab retreating in a homogeneous oceanic domain and a slab retreating along a continental margin before entering an oceanic domain. We study the influence of the thickness of the sediment cover on the oceanic crust and the intensity of surface processes. We show that the sediment thickness and the surface processes both affect the retreat dynamics in a distinct manner, and, when the slab retreats along a continental margin, also influence its trajectory. A thick sediment cover leads to the building of a large accretionary prism which acts as a lock on the system and slows down the slab retreat. When the slab retreats along a continental margin, the thicker the sediment cover, the stronger the slab deviation from that margin. Surface processes have a more complex role which depends on the amount of sediments available. In systems where little sediments are available, a higher efficiency of surface processes leads to a slow down of slab retreat by accumulating sediments in the accretionary wedge. In systems where a lot of sediments are available, a higher efficiency of surface processes slightly speeds up the retreat, by eroding the overriding plate and the subducting plate respectively at the front and the back of the accretionary wedge, as well as the prism itself when reaching a high enough elevation, thereby decreasing the mechanical locking caused by the accumulation of sediments.\n               ","98":"\n                  Knowledge of the regional crustal deformation and stress field is fundamental to understanding and constrain the ongoing evolution of Hovsgol basin, northwest Mongolia. The 2021 Mw 6.7 Turt earthquake provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the local tectonic stress field and upper crust deformation. We investigate the coseismic surface displacements and invert fault slip models using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations and teleseismic data. The mainshock occurred as a result of normal faulting with a right-lateral strike-slip component on an NW striking plane, which is consistent with the transtensive local stress field inverted from regional focal mechanisms. It is surrounded by transpressive and strike-slip stress fields proposed by previous studies indicating regional stress heterogeneity probably controlled by the distinct structure geometries in and around Hovsgol basin. Our results also suggest that the current deformation of the Hovsgol basin is dominated by half-graben forming. Seven historical strong earthquakes (M 7) may advance the 2021 Turt earthquake by ~12% recurrence interval, based on the assumption of equal stress release from recurrence earthquakes, meanwhile, the 2021 Turt earthquake may increase the potential seismic hazard on the neighbor Mondy and South Hovsgol faults, which deserves more attention.\n               ","99":"\n                  Deformation in oblique convergent margins, especially non-plane deformation in d\u00e9collement belts within such a margin, is not fully understood. The northern Zhangbaling tectonic belt represents an oblique convergent margin to the east of the NNE\u2013SSW-striking Tan\u2013Lu Fault Zone that separates the Yangtze Block to the east from the North China Craton to the west, and it provides a good opportunity to understand deformation in the margin. The tectonic belt consists of a fold-and-thrust belt in the east and a low-angle ductile d\u00e9collement belt in the west. The fold-and-thrust belt in the marginal cover rocks indicates a pure shear-dominated deformation, and the fold axes rotated with the long axis of the horizontal finite strain ellipse. The underlying d\u00e9collement belt was involved in a non-plane deformation owing to the superposition of wrenching along the Tan\u2013Lu Fault Zone and horizontal d\u00e9collement shearing. The horizontal d\u00e9collement shearing dominated in the development of the flat-lying foliation, whereas the wrenching mostly dominated in the development of stretching lineations. Top-to-the-SSW sense of shear dominates in the central to southern parts of the d\u00e9collement belt, whereas top-to-the-SSE sense of shear is widely present in the northern part of the belt and locally in other parts. Partitioning of the non-plane deformation is shown by kinematic partitioning within the originally flat-lying d\u00e9collement belt, and it is different from the strain partitioning in a transpressional zone involved in plane deformation.

The results showed methane as predominant gas and temporal changes in gas concentrations that were in part due to daily fluctuations, which caused small amplitude variations, and in part due to non-environmental causes. These latter were correlated with the occurrence of strong earthquakes and slow tectonic events related to magmatic intrusions, but not with input of magmatic gases into the thermal aquifer, given the non-magmatic origin of all monitored gases. Methane spikes were observed during many volcano-tectonic events and call for a deep source of this gas. H2S was detected only during the strongest local tectonic events, including a Mw 4.9 earthquake, suggesting that this gas has a common origin as CH4 (i.e., mixing between microbial and thermogenic gas), but it is released only when tectonic stress is applied for sufficiently long periods as to cause H2S oversaturation in the hydrothermal aquifer. Water temperature decreases were also observed immediately after the two strongest earthquakes in the area, which helped us produce a comprehensive model to explain the observed geochemical variations. Our approach allowed revealing the great sensitivity of gases such as CH4 and especially H2S to tectonic stress, thus making them valuable indicators of impending strong tectonic or volcano-tectonic events.\n               ","101":"\n                  We present results of apatite fission-track analysis of seven intrusions located within the Permian-Triassic Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (LIP): (1) alkaline-ultramafic central type plutons of Odikhincha, Yessey and Magan, (2) intrusions of Norilsk-1 and Kontay, (3) Padunsky sill, and (4) Kotuy dike. Additionally, we also present a set of new geochronological data for some of studied intrusions: (a) LA-ICPMS UPb apatite ages of the Odikhincha pluton (266\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029\u00a0Ma) and the Padunsky sill (241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012); (b) RbSr ages from the Odikhincha (258.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0Ma), Magan (242.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8\u00a0Ma) and Yessey (243.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0Ma) plutons; and (c) 40Ar\/39Ar mica ages from the Odikhincha (264.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0Ma) and Magan (254.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0Ma) plutons. Most of these intrusions, probably with the exception of the Odikhincha, were emplaced during the most voluminous phase of the Siberian Traps magmatism ca. 252\u2013251\u00a0Ma, but their AFT ages are distributed from 207\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 to 173\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0Ma and much younger than Late Permian to Early Triassic isotopic ages from these and other Siberian Traps LIP intrusions. Available AFT, UPb, RbSr and 40Ar\/39Ar data and time-temperature modeling has allowed us to create the first model of the post-Paleozoic tectono-thermal history of the Siberian Traps.

We propose this later cooling event is linked to exhumation associated with coeval Late Triassic-Early Jurassic large-scale uplift of the Siberian platform caused by collisional processes at its periphery. Our new results also indicate that at least a 1\u20132\u00a0km thickness of Siberian Traps lavas have been removed by erosion in the north of the Siberian platform since eruption, implying the total volume of the Permian-Triassic lavas was much greater than that currently preserved today.\n               ","102":"\n                  The uplift mechanism and geodynamic model of the northeastern (NE) Tibetan Plateau remain controversial. Two competing models have been proposed for the uplift of the NE Tibetan Plateau, including crustal shortening through folding or thrust faulting and the middle-lower crustal flow model. Here, we applied the joint inversion of surface wave dispersions and receiver functions with P-wave velocity constraints on a dense linear broadband seismic array to obtain the Vs and Vp\/Vs profiles of the crust and uppermost mantle across northeastern Tibet. The inversion yields robust structural images that show stark Vs and Vp\/Vs jumps across the West Qinling fault from the Songpan-Ganzi and Kunlun-West Qinling terranes (south) to the Qilian and North China terranes (north). The results reveal that regional low-Vs\/high-Vp\/Vs anomalies present in the middle-to-lower crust, which may be the signature of viscous flow, are distinctly limited south of the West Qinling fault. In contrast, the imaged physical properties of the crust and mantle lithosphere north of this fault manifest a rigid pattern, which is inferred to be originated from the North China craton underthrust below the northern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Our seismic imaging indicates that the NE corner of the Tibetan Plateau does not currently serve as the flow channel of the ductile material from the central and northern Tibet.\n               ","103":"","104":"\n                  The east-west (E-W) trending South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) and the north-south (N-S) trending normal faults and detachments have played significant roles in the Himalayan tectonic evolution since the Miocene. The Ama Drime Massif (ADM), which is bounded by the STDS in the north as well as the Dinggye and Kharta N-S trending detachments in the east and west, respectively, is a rare place where N-S and E-W extensions interacted and thus contains key information to detect the evolution of Himalayan extensional structures. Aiming at fully reconstructing the exhumation process of the ADM and figuring out the mid-Miocene evolution of Himalayan extensional structures, this contribution provides detailed field investigations and geochronological, petrological, as well as mineral compositional studies to constrain the activity of the detachments surrounding the ADM, the metamorphic process, and the thermal state of the ADM. The geochronological results suggest that both the STDS and the Dinggye detachment were active at 13\u00a0Ma. Unlike the Dinggye detachment, whose ductile deformation terminated at ~10\u00a0Ma, the Kharta detachment maintained its ductile deformation until at least 8.5\u00a0Ma. Geochronological, petrological, and mineral compositional analyses show that the ADM paragneiss underwent muscovite dehydration melting and garnet breakdown from at least 20\u00a0Ma to 12.5\u00a0Ma, indicating a long-term exhumation of the ADM. Importantly, biotite dehydration melting and garnet growth in the ADM orthogneiss suggest a heating event in the ADM at 15\u201313\u00a0Ma. Based on the temporal relationship of different extensional structures, the exhumation of the ADM was dominated by the STDS before 15\u00a0Ma, and subsequently by the E-W extension of the Dinggye and Kharta detachments since 15\u201313\u00a0Ma. The E-W extension led to significant uplift and melting of the ADM gneisses, which made the STDS reactivate as a passive stretching detachment after its ~15\u00a0Ma cessation. In the mid-Miocene E-W extensional regime, the ADM had exhumed asymmetrically with decreasing time and amount of the exhumation from its eastern side to the western side. Together with the heating event, the asymmetric exhumation indicates the lateral delamination of the subducted Indian lithosphere beneath the ADM in the middle Miocene. From a wider perspective, the mid-Miocene E-W extensions in the Himalayan Orogen were intrinsically controlled by the deep geodynamic process of the subducted Indian lithosphere and played a important role in the diachronous cessation of the STDS.\n               ","105":"\n                  We review in this paper the major late Mesozoic contractional deformation in North and NE China and establish the tempo-spatial distribution pattern of Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatism, with the aim at clarifying its link with evolving multi-plate convergent geodynamics in NE Asia. We recognize two major changes in tectonic regime, one occurring at ~170 Ma, which marks the tectonic switch from extensional to compressional regimes, while another at ~135 Ma which manifests the change from compressional to extensional settings. Accordingly, Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatism migrated from the marginal zones in ~200 -170 Ma to the continental interior in 170-135 Ma and then was followed by Mid-Cretaceous (135-120 Ma) magmatic flare-up in the continental interior, which migrated progressively eastward since ~120 Ma. Based on these observations, we make a division of three tectonic stages and discuss their plate geodynamic setting. (1) The early stage in 200-170 Ma was dominantly under extensional setting with A-type granitoids and bi-modal volcanism occurring along the eastern and northern marginal zones. (2) The middle stage in 170-135 Ma was manifested by significant multi-directional crustal shortening and rejuvenation of the ancient orogenic belts, as distant response to multi-plate convergence along the East Asia continental margins. (3) The late stage was manifested first by a thermal surge in 135-120 Ma with the formation of extensional structures and rift basins in the continental interior, then followed by alternation of tectonic compression and extension, related to the effect of paleo-Pacific slab subduction. We propose that the thickening acquired during the middle tectonic stage and subsequent lithospheric thinning in the late stage triggered large-scale crustal melting, episodic magmatism and associated metallogenic outbreak in North and NE China.\n               ","106":"\n                  To understand the stress controls on the occurrence of a multi-fault rupture, we estimated the crustal stress between April 2013 to December 2018, i.e., before and after the Mw7.8 Kaik\u014dura earthquake that occurred in New Zealand on 13 November 2016. We used both the focal mechanism solutions from the temporary seismic networks and the GeoNet moment tensor solutions and selected the solutions that differed significantly from the mainshock fault planes and rakes. Then, we performed stress tensor inversions for the selected focal mechanism solutions. Using the stress tensor inversion results, we also calculated the slip tendency. Prior to the Kaik\u014dura earthquake, the stress regime was the strike-slip type, and the maximum eigenvalue of the stress tensor (\u03c31) was oriented WNW\u2013ESE. The stress field orientation did not change significantly after the earthquake. This suggests that the stress change during the Kaik\u014dura earthquake was too small to alter the stress orientations, implying that there may have been large differential stress prior to the Kaik\u014dura earthquake. However, the average stress ratio in different clusters changed in two different patterns after the earthquake, suggesting possible changes in the magnitude of different components of the stress tensor, or of pore pressure in different regions. A high slip tendency was observed at the hypocentre, while a low slip tendency was observed at the northern end of the Kaik\u014dura earthquake faults. This may suggest that the stress orientation and the stress ratio controlled the initiation and the end of the multi-fault rupture. These results corroborate previous fault propagation models.\n               ","107":"\n                  We present a joint interpretation of the aeromagnetic and gravity anomaly datasets of the Precambrian Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, eastern India, to delineate the detailed crustal architecture, identify faults and shear zones, as well as boundaries of different terranes throughout this belt. We use geological constrained analysis of the distinct aeromagnetic anomaly signatures to re-interpret the extent of the Jeypore, Krishna, Eastern Ghats, and Rengali Provinces. Forward modelling of paired gravity anomalies and an increase in magnetic response along the craton-mobile belt boundary reveal that it is dominated by high-density and highly magnetic granulite facies rocks that overthrust the low-density and low magnetic older cratonic gneissic rocks along the deep crustal faults, suggesting the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt terranes are allochthonous in nature. Two high magnetic anomaly belts in the Krishna and Eastern Ghats Provinces define a terrane-scale fold (orocline). The younger normal faults of Godavari Basin overprint the charnockitic belt in the southern part of the Eastern Ghats Province, suggesting that these high magnetic belts pre-date the Pan-African Orogeny. The boundary between the Eastern Ghats Province and Krishna Province is identified by the change in anomalies in magnetic and gravity maps. The Sileru Shear Zone and Kerajung Shear Zone separates the Eastern Ghats Province-Jeypore Province and Eastern Ghats Province-Rengali Province respectively, are characterized by a sharp change in magnetic anomalies. The intra-province Nagavali-Vamsadhara Shear Zone and Mahanadi Shear Zone are characterized by subdued magnetic anomalies.

The predominant NW-SE-oriented fast polarization directions (FPDs) are consistent with lithospheric deformation and asthenospheric flow to the first order. However, the FPDs of the stations close to the Siberian Craton are more parallel to the cratonic margin than those departing from the craton. It indicates that the shape of the rigid Siberian Craton may determine the extent of the present lithospheric deformation and cause the deflection of the asthenospheric flow. Large SKS splitting delay times are distributed in the Hovsgol rift and Gobi-Altai range, implying superimposed past and present lithospheric anisotropy, and the asthenospheric anisotropy as well under the Hovsgol rift. Small delay times in the Hangai Dome indicate the asthenospheric upwelling which causes the uplift of the dome.\n               ","109":"\n                  The subsurface structure of the Himalaya is dominated by the seismically active Main Himalayan Thrust fault, which accommodates about half of the plate convergence between India and Asia. In Central Nepal, geological, geophysical, and geodetic studies indicate that the Main Himalayan Thrust has a flat-ramp-flat geometry, which causes cooling, erosion, and exhumation of rocks to be faster above the mid-crustal ramp than above the adjacent upper and lower flats. However, in the northern High Himalaya the ramp geometry, in particular its width and depth are not well resolved. To place further constraints on the northward extent and depth of the ramp, we present for the first time low-temperature thermochronological data and U-Pb zircon ages from the Gyirong region, China (northern High Himalaya). Our zircon U-Pb data show that the protolith of the High Himalayan orthogneisses is 478\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0Ma old, and was intruded by a large leucogranite at 19.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma.

Together with published cooling ages from Nepal farther south, the ages define a U-shaped pattern across the Main Himalayan Thrust, with ages increasing to the north and south from a minimum in the High Himalaya. A thermo-kinematic model, in which the geometry of the mid-crustal ramp was varied, explains the age data and suggests that the ramp has a dip of ~22\u00b0N. Compared to previous models, our new ages require that the ramp has a greater width (~55\u00a0km) and reaches a greater depth (~34\u00a0km) below the northern High Himalaya.

Rock magnetic experiments show that hematite is the principal magnetization carrier in all these rocks. Rocks of the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera show intermediate magnetic fabrics. Magnetic fabrics of rocks from the Santander Massif, and the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera, are uniformly oblate with preservation of sedimentary fabrics. Directions of the ChRM from sites in the Eastern Cordillera (30 accepted of 35 sites) are interpreted to indicate that the axial zone has not been rotated, whereas sites located along the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera yield data suggesting clockwise rotations, which increase in magnitude up to 90\u00b0 in areas bounded by NE-striking transverse faults. In the Santander Massif (9 accepted of 12 sites) data suggest a mix of counterclockwise rotations (~30\u00b0) and clockwise rotations of ~40\u00b0. The inferred clockwise vertical-axis rotations in the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif of up to 45\u00b0 are interpreted to be related to tectonic inversion of pre-existing Mesozoic age normal faults during the Neogene as right-lateral faults.

Our results show distinct gaps in the evolutionary trends of crack aspect ratios and grain elastic moduli from intact rocks to fault rocks. Crack aspect ratios show a nonlinear trend from intact rock to fault gouge, and then these values in fault gouge were considerably higher than in fractured rock and transition rock. In contrast, grain elastic moduli decreased as fracture evolved with the development and subsequent extinction of shear planes and then increased markedly with the formation of fault gouge.

We propose that this most recent surface-rupturing earthquake on the Purgatorio Fault was the 1715C.E earthquake recorded in the historical catalogue of the region, which was previously attributed to the megathrust offshore. Our results highlight the importance of establishing a paleoseismic record of onshore faults to differentiate between major megathrust and forearc earthquakes. Given the proximity of these shallow, onshore faults to coastal communities in Peru, the shallow earthquakes they generate may pose a severe, yet often overlooked, seismic hazard.\n               ","115":"\n                  After the devastating Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0, 2011) in Japan, the Korean Peninsula has experienced a higher number of large, plus Mw 5.0, earthquakes than recorded in the preceding half century of modern monitoring. In addition, seismicity has dramatically increased along with seismic waves arriving later than prior to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, suggesting that the Korean crust has notably been perturbed. South Korea is densely populated, hence knowledge about active faults and earthquake mechanisms is of great relevance for public safety and risk mitigations. Quaternary faults, including the Chugaryeong crustal-scale fault, run through the Seoul metropolitan area and recent seismicity studies suggest that these faults are active. Based on two reflection seismic profiles, we provide compelling evidence that the depth clustered seismicity along the Chugaryeong fault is associated with the intersections of other fault systems. The two seismicity clusters, observed at two depth intervals of approximately 4.5\u20135 and 8\u20139\u00a0km, can be linked with two moderately-to-steeply-dipping bands of reflectivity interpreted to be splay faults and terminating at the Chugaryeong sub-vertical fault. We suggest that stress builds up at these fault intersections and is then released via strike-slip ruptures along the Chugaryeong fault. Time-clustered seismic events at the fault intersections support this hypothesis, indicating a start-stop mechanism is controlling the seismicity in the region at least based on nearly one decade of seismicity observations. The start-stop seismicity behaviour can possibly be used for forecasting earthquakes and their switching depth along the Chugaryeong fault.\n               ","116":"\n                  The ongoing Cenozoic Indo-Asia continental collision not only formed the highly elevated Tibetan Plateau but also reactivated the crustal deformation in adjacent Paleozoic-Mesozoic orogens. This includes the renewed phase of deformation in the Qinling Orogen, northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, which was formed initially by Paleozoic closure of the Paleo-Tethys and subsequent early Triassic continental collision between the North and South China blocks. Debates continue as to when and how the reactivation initiated. To investigate this question, this study reports a vertical profile of apatite and zircon (UTh)\/He thermochronometric ages from the Guangtoushan Granite to estimate the exhumation history of the central Qinling Orogen, where previous models for the growth of the Tibetan Plateau inferred late Cenozoic northeastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau by outward flow of the lower crust from the plateau interior. Age-elevation relationship and thermal history modelling suggest two phases of relatively rapid exhumation during the early Cretaceous (~130\u2013110\u00a0Ma) and the latest Cretaceous \u2013 early Paleocene (~70\u201350\u00a0Ma), respectively. The early Cretaceous exhumation coincided with the time of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision, whose far field effects have been widely reported in regions of the central-northern Tibetan Plateau. In the southern and central Qinling, our finding of an early Paleocene (~70\u201350\u00a0Ma) increase in exhumation rate followed by minimal exhumation during the late Cenozoic suggests negligible impact of the lower crust flow from the expanding Tibetan Plateau on the rock exhumation of the Qinling. Instead, our study suggests instant strain migrations from the Lhasa-Qiangtang and Indo-Asia collision zones to the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau during the early Cretaceous and the early Paleocene, respectively, supporting the models highlighting the importance of rigid blocks in facilitating intracontinental strain migration.\n               ","117":"\n                  Geophysical techniques can improve knowledge about the deep structures of collisional orogens. Therefore, magnetotelluric and gravimetric data were combined in this study to enhance the poorly understood subsurface structure of the transition zone from the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton to the Neoproterozoic Sergipano Orogen in northeastern Brazil. The results along a 240-km-long, NE\u2013SW trending geophysical transect revealed two main geoelectric domains beneath the Cretaceous Tucano Basin, which can be linked to two distinct tectonic blocks on the surface. The less resistive SW domain corresponds to the rocks of the Serrinha Block within the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. In contrast, the more resistive NE domain matches the basement rocks of the northernmost units of the Sergipano Orogen. The results are discussed considering Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic scenarios with different interpretations of the NE domain. Based on the surface geology and additional gravimetric and magnetotelluric data, the best scenario is to consider the NE domain as representing the geoelectric signature of the three northernmost geological domains of the Sergipano Orogen (Macurur\u00e9, Po\u00e7o Redondo\u2013Maranc\u00f3, and Canind\u00e9) and that of the Pernambuco\u2013Alagoas Block (PEAL). PEAL collided with the S\u00e3o Francisco paleolithosphere forming the Sergipano Orogen. The NE geoelectric domain can be interpreted as an indenter of the tectonically intruded PEAL beneath the S\u00e3o Francisco paleolithosphere. The new data properly define the northern limit of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton and explain both indentation structures and contrasting sediment provenance observed in the Sergipano Orogen.\n               ","118":"\n                  Gravity changes related to large earthquake preparation are reported in broad seismogenic source regions, and crustal fluids may change the gravity potential and trigger earthquakes. However, what is the major factors affecting crustal fluids movement in the upper 10\u00a0km of the continental crust and altering the gravity potential is still poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the gravity changes caused by invasion of crustal fluids into the depth of 6\u201310\u00a0km using finite element based numerical modeling. We conducted a series of numerical experiments to investigate the influences of permeability distribution, the fluid source, and the invasion depth on gravity changes. The sensitivity analysis and comparison results suggest that the invasion of high-pressure fluids increases fluid density and produces positive gravity changes within a decade. Fluid pressure is the key factor for the variations of fluid density, while temperature exerts a minor influence. Consistent with the dissipation of fluid pressure, the corresponding gravity changes are fast (>3 \u03bcGal\/year) in the first 2\u20133\u00a0years of fluid invasion and become increasingly slow later. Therefore, the first few years are the more suitable time for monitoring the gravity changes caused by crustal fluids invasion. The fluid-related gravity changes are positively correlated to the porosity and permeability of rocks adjacent to the fluid source, the salinity and the scale of crustal fluids, and the initial temperatures, and are negatively correlated to the invasion depth. Transient invasion of crustal fluids can be detected by means of the high precision gravity observation under certain conditions subjected to the initial geological characteristics of the continental crust and the geochemical evolution of the fluid sources.\n               ","119":"\n                  Paleomagnetic data reviewed along an 800-km transect extending from northeastern Oregon into southwest Montana indicate adjacent crustal blocks experienced post-Jurassic vertical-axis clockwise rotation relative to North America. From west to east, rotated blocks include relict island-arc and related terranes of the Blue Mountains province (Oregon: >60\u00b0 rotation), calc-alkaline plutons along the arc\u2013continent boundary (Idaho: ~30\u00b0 rotation), and displaced passive margin strata in the Rocky Mountain foreland (Montana: \u226460\u00b0 rotation). Assessment of polyphase contractional deformation shows oroclinal bending (~35\u00b0 westward swing) of the Blue Mountains block concurrent with clockwise turning of the entire terrane province (our variant of conventional model; S.W.

These orogenic hinterlands are characterized by high topography and thickened crust, marked by synorogenic extensional structures at high elevations or on steep topographic slopes. In contrast contractional structures occur at lower elevations on the flanks of the mountain belts. In many cases, the extension is perpendicular to the orogen (Bennett et al., 2003; Dalmayrac and Molnar, 1981; Suarez et al., 1983; Thatcher et al., 1999; Tibaldi and Bonali, 2018) or parallel to the orogen (Armijo et al., 1986; Chevalier et al., 2020; Molnar and Lyon-Caent, 1989; Yin et al., 1999). In Taiwan, although mountain heights are lower than in these classic orogens, GPS-derived strain rate data and earthquake focal mechanisms show that the high elevations are dominated by extension, whereas the lower elevations are dominated by contraction (Hsu et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2008). This phenomenon is similar to the orogenic belts in Tibet and Andes. Previous studies proposed different hypothesis to explain the extension in the Central Range, including buoyancy forces related to subducted continental crust (Lin, 2000), and gravitational collapse of over-thickened continental crust (Hsu et al., 2009), possibly associated with underplating (Crespi et al., 1996). These hypotheses provide a mechanism for vertical shortening and gravitational collapse of the upper crust in the Central Range, but not the relatively unusual extension direction, which is oblique to the orogen rather than orthogonal. This important observation suggests a more complicated gravitational model or tectonic process may be responsible for extension in the core of the southern Central Range. Moreover, the structures that accommodate the relatively high rates of rock uplift (Ching et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2018) and exhumation (Hsu et al., 2016) in the southern Central Range are still unknown.\nIn this paper, we document late-stage structures exposed along the eastern flank of the southern Central Range where leveling and GPS data suggest a steep gradient in uplift rates and we integrate these data with earthquake focal mechanism to evaluate different hypotheses for the origin of synorogenic normal faults. We propose a tectonic model in which the crust in southwest Taiwan is shortened between the obliquely colliding Peikang High and the Luzon Arc and that shortening is accommodated by lateral and vertical movement of the crust.\n\n\n2\nTectonic and geologic background\nThe Taiwan orogenic belt is located on the boundary between the Philippine Sea and Eurasian Plates (Fig. 1A). The Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Ryukyu Trench in the north, whereas to the south of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea plate is overriding the crust of the South China Sea along the Manila trench (Teng, 1990). With the northwestward movement of the Philippine Sea Plate at 82\u00a0mm per year (Yu et al., 1997) since 5\u00a0Ma (Ho, 1986; Teng, 1990), resulting in an oblique collision between the north trending Luzon arc and the northeast trending passive continental margin of the Eurasia plate (Chai, 1972). The Taiwan mountain belt can be divided into seven tectonostratigraphic units, from east to west are the Coastal Range, the Longitudinal Valley, the Tananao Metamorphic Complex (Tailuko and Yuli belts), the Backbone Range slate belt, the Hs\u00fcehshan Range slate belt, the Western Foothill fold and thrust belt, and Coastal plain (Fig. 1A)(Ho, 1988). Across the orogeny, there is an overall eastward increase in the metamorphic grade and complexity of deformation (Beyssac et al., 2007; Chen, 1994). From west to east in the Central Range, the dominant foliation (S1) is overprinted by a crenulation cleavage (S2) (Clark et al., 1992; Stanley et al., 1981). There is also a general change in the dip direction of both S1 and S2; in the west the dominant foliation dips east whereas in the east the dominant foliation dips west. This fan-shaped pattern of foliation has been interpreted to reflect east vergent backfolding (Faure et al., 1991; Fisher et al., 2007; Stanley et al., 1981), or alternatively as a result of motion along an east-dipping, normal fault zone (Crespi et al., 1996).\nThe western margin of the Taiwan orogenic belt shows a stretched S shape in map view (Fig. 1A). This shape represents the influence of a pre-Tertiary basement feature, the Peikang High, in the subducting plate (Fig. 1A). The trend of folds and faults (Angelier et al., 1986), and GPS data (Bos et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2003) surrounding the Peikang High reveal a fan-shaped pattern of compressive axes in the fold and thrust belt (Fig. 1A). This pattern suggests the Peikang High acts as a rigid indenter (Hu et al., 1996), deflecting the fold and thrust belt but not the Backbone Range slate belt and Tailuko Belt.\nVertical GPS and leveling data in southern Taiwan show an eastward increasing uplift rate from Western Foothills to the topographic divide, and then a decreasing uplift rate along the eastern flank of the southern Central Range (Fig. 1C; Ching et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2018). This pattern is similar to the topographic profile in southern Taiwan (Fig. 1C). However, leveling profiles across southern Taiwan during two different time periods show a significant gradient but different rate of uplift along the eastern flank of the Central Range; the maximum uplift rate is 17.19\u00a0mm\/yr. (Ching et al., 2011) from 2000 to 2008, and 10\u00a0mm\/yr from 2007 to 2015 (Hsu et al., 2018), respectively (Fig. 1C). Hsu et al. (2018) point out that Ching et al. (2011) corrected the coseismic deformation of the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi and 2003 Mw 6.8 Chengkung earthquakes but did not correct the post-seismic deformation, resulting in the discrepancy of the uplift rate in the eastern flank of the Central Range between two time periods. The mean uplift rate of 6\u00a0mm\/yr between the eastern Central Range and the frontal fold and thrust belt (Hsu et al., 2018).\nThe strain-rate field estimated from GPS data exhibits a contraction regime in the Coastal Range and western Taiwan, whereas significant extension in northeastern Taiwan and Central Range (Bos et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2009). GPS and geologic data have previously demonstrated a deflection of contraction axes in western Taiwan from east-west trends to northeast-southwest trends (Fig. 1A; Angelier et al., 1986; Bos et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2009). Geologic (Angelier et al., 2009; Lacombe et al., 2001) and geodetic (Bos et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2007; Lacombe et al., 2001) data also suggest lateral extrusion in southwestern Taiwan which is consistent with sandbox experiments of an oblique collision (Lu and Malavieille, 1994). The fan-shaped contraction axes and southwest lateral extrusion are interpreted to be due to the relatively rigid Peikang High colliding against the Luzon Arc (Fig. 1A; Hu et al., 1996). Quaternary paleostress analyses also suggest the southwest lateral extrusion in southwestern Taiwan during the late Pleistocene (Lacombe et al., 2001).\nThe distribution of earthquake focal mechanisms show a correlation with topography in Taiwan, with high elevation (elevation >1500\u00a0m) dominated by normal and strike-slip faulting, whereas the surrounding lower elevations are dominated by thrust and strike-slip faulting (Chen et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2008). The stress field derived from earthquake focal mechanisms shows that \u03c31 has a fan-shaped pattern in western Taiwan, which is in agreement with previous studies based on geological data (Angelier et al., 1986), borehole breakout data (Suppe et al., 1985), and the contraction axes derived from GPS velocity field (Bos et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2009). These observations imply a brittle deformation regime against the Peikang High and a consistent deformation pattern from the surface down to a maximal depth of 20\u00a0km (Chen et al., 2017). In addition, the upper crust of the southern Central Range is dominated by normal faulting with northeast-southwest extension (Conand et al., 2020; Crespi et al., 1996; Hsu et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2008). Previous studies suggest the extension in the southern Central Range could be due to buoyancy forces related to subducted continental crust (Lin, 2000), or to gravitational collapse resulting from over-thickened continental crust (Hsu et al., 2009), or possibly associated with underplating at depth (Crespi et al., 1996), or left-lateral transtensional brittle deformation (Conand et al., 2020).\nIn the northern part of the southern Central Range a zone of low seismicity and high heat flow correlates with a crustal-scale zone of ambient tremors, suggesting ductile flow of the crust in this area (Fig. 1A). The tremors form a sub-vertical, southeast dipping ellipsoidal structure (Chuang et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2012) and Ide et al. (2015) proposed that the tremors reflected WNW-ESE compression. In the upper crust, above the tremor cluster, swarms of small earthquakes, typically with normal fault focal mechanisms, delineate sub-vertical planar structures (Chuang et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2018) argued that as the Eurasian continental crust is progressively subducted both ambient temperature and the resistance to subduction increase, leading to the release of metamorphic fluids and the development a sub-vertical, brittle-ductile shear zone. Recent helium isotope studies of well and hot spring waters structurally above the tremors also indicate mantle contamination which may signal the possible existence of melt in the lower crust and upper mantle in the southern Central Range (Chen et al., 2019). The correlation of high helium isotopic ratios with deep tremors and shallow extensional structures suggests that the tremors represent crustal-scale conduits that allow the helium movement through from the upper mantle (Chen et al., 2019).\nRecent fission track and (UTh)\/He dates of totally reset detrital apatite and zircon grains indicate an accelerated exhumation in the eastern Central Range of the Taiwan orogenic belt from 2 to 1.5\u00a0Ma (Hsu et al., 2016). The age-elevation curves and thermal models imply three stages of exhumation: prior to ca. 2\u00a0Ma exhumation rates were relatively slow \u223c0.1\u00a0mm\/yr.), from ca. 2\u20131.5\u00a0Ma to ca. 0.5\u00a0Ma (rates increased to 2\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr.), and from ca. 0.5\u00a0Ma to present rates accelerated to 4\u20138\u00a0mm\/yr. The rate of this most recent, relatively rapid increase in exhumation in the southern Central Range is consistent with geodetic and seismic data that show active uplift of the range. The brittle structures that accommodated this rapid exhumation, however, are still unknown.\n\n\n3\nRegional- and outcrop-scale faults in the southern central range\nTo understand the origin of the gradient in the rate of uplift along the Southern Cross-Island Highway (SXIH) identified by the leveling surveys (Fig. 1C; Ching et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2018), we integrated a detailed analysis of fault data collected along the Xinwulu and Dalun Rivers and along a 32\u00a0km section of the SXIH (Fig. 1B) with a regional-scale study of the southeast part of the range using a 6\u00a0m three digital elevation models (DEMs) (https:\/\/landslide.geologycloud.tw\/map\/zh-tw) and two UAV studies along the ridge crest (Fig. 1A and white colour mountain in Fig. 1B). Although these studies cover significantly different spatial scales they yield a consistent pattern of stress and strain. We also include a discussion of GPS and earthquake focal mechanisms to show consistency with the current stress and strain fields. Taken together, these integrated data sets suggest substantial lateral and vertical movement of the upper and lower crust.\n\n3.1\nOutcrop-scale fault data\nAll of the river and highway field sites are located in low to moderate-grade metamorphic rocks such as metasandstone, slate, and schist (Fig. 2\n). In total, 164 faults were identified in the field, 141 of which consist of striations and slip-sense indicators (Table S1). Slip sense was inferred using various indicators, including drag folds, Riedel shears, tool marks, quartz slickenfibers, slickenside lineations, and offset marks (Fig. 3\n). Of the 141 faults, 48 are strike-slip faults, and 93 are normal faults (Table S1). In order to aid in the identification of scattered fault populations associated with a particular stress tensor, we distinguish groups of faults based on crosscutting relationships and the natural material of the fault zone and recognized two styles of deformation: A) faults characterized by stretched calcite or quartz fibers on the fault plane and B) faults characterized by rock-on-rock slickenlines, fault gauge, or\/and breccia on the fault plane (Fig. 3). Of the 141 faults, 135 of the faults were classified as B-type whereas 6 of the faults were classified as A-type. Crosscutting relationships indicate that all faults postdate cleavage formation (Fig. 3), however, there is no distinctly consistent crosscutting relationship between two fault types.\n\n3.1.1\nInversion of fault-slip data: methods\nThe primary aim of paleostress inversion is to determine the orientations of the three principal stresses (maximum \u03c3 1, intermediate \u03c3 2, and minimum \u03c3 3) that form the axes of the stress ellipsoid and represent the eigenvectors of the best-fit stress tensor that activated the fault population. In this study, we used the Gauss method to analyze the 141 faults with a known sense of slip, which is based on the direct stress inversion (Angelier, 1994). The advantage of the Gauss method is the ability to isolate homogeneous subsystems within a population of heterogeneous fault data. The Gauss method, based on the direct stress inversion technique (Angelier, 1994), has been implemented in the T-TECTO computer program by \u017dalohar (\u017dalohar, 2009). The functions embedded in the Gauss method allow the user to analyze the distribution of angular misfit (\u03b1) between the shear stress and actual direction of slip along the faults on the fault plane and separate polyphase fault populations by employing several user-defined parameters (\u017dalohar and Vrabec, 2007). The essential user-defined parameters of the Gauss method are: \u0394, \u00d81, \u00d82, k, s, where \u0394 is the threshold value of compatibility, \u00d81 is the angle of the internal friction, \u00d82 is the angle of friction for sliding on a preexisting fault, k is the stress parameter that weights the importance of friction, and s is a dispersion parameter, which represents the value of the second moment of the distribution of angular misfit between the shear stress and actual direction of slip along the faults. (\u017dalohar and Vrabec, 2007). In addition, in order to constrain inversion results to mechanically acceptable solutions, the Gauss method considers the ratios between the normal and shear stress on the fault plane consistent with the principles of Mohr-Coulomb failure by plotting the position of the \u201c Mohr point\u201d for each fault on a Mohr diagram. Fault populations outside of a user-defined misfit angle with the first best-fit stress tensor are removed from the data set and analyzed in the same way, to find the second population with the second best-fit stress tensor. The process is repeated until there are no independent populations of faults. The first population with a compatible stress tensor is classified as \u201c phase 1\u201d and the second population is phase 2, and so forth. We limited our analysis to phases with 10 or more faults.\n\n\n3.1.2\nInversion of fault-slip data: results\nBecause the field observations of the fault data do not show well-defined cross-cutting relations, we utilize the Gauss stress inversion method to isolate homogeneous subsystems within all fault-slip data. We analyzed all 141 faults with a known sense of slip as depicted in Fig. 4\n; the results of the Gauss stress inversion method are given in Table 1\n. Inversion of the 141 faults yielded two phases: Phase 1 contains 84 faults and yields a maximum extension axis that trends sub-horizontally 225\u00b0 and a maximum shortening direction that plunges 82\u00b0 to the southeast (Fig. 4). Phase 2 contains 28 faults and with a maximum shortening direction that plunges gently towards 148\u00b0 and the maximum extension axis that plunges gently to 056\u00b0 (Fig. 4).\nAdditional phases contain significantly few faults and show less well-defined patterns shown in Fig. S1: phase 3 contains 10 faults and yields a maximum extension axis that trends sub-horizontally 084\u00b0 and a maximum shortening direction that plunges 67\u00b0 to the south; phase 4 contains 9 faults and with a maximum shortening direction that plunges gently towards 294\u00b0 and the maximum extension axis that trends sub-horizontally 200\u00b0; phase 5 contains 6 faults and with a maximum shortening direction that plunges gently towards 214\u00b0and the maximum extension axis that plunges gently towards 116\u00b0.\n\n\n\n3.2\nRegional-scale faults\nTo complement the detailed field studies, we identified and mapped additional structures that represent potential regional-scale faults using DEMs supplemented with field observations where possible. Two of the DEMs are based on Lidar data collected by the Central Geological Survey (CGS) in Taiwan with a 6\u00a0m resolution (Figs. 5 and 7\n) (https:\/\/landslide.geologycloud.tw\/map\/zh-tw). Two additional DEMs were constructed from photomosaics collected with a UAV during two field expeditions to the area around Jianming Lake (Fig. 6\n). The DEMs from the Jianming Lake area were constructed using a UAV and Pix4Dmapper which is an application in Pix4D software suite (Computer Vision Lab in Switzerland; http:\/\/pix4d.com). Pix4Dmapper includes rayCloud, which extends the 3D triangulation and increases the accuracy of modeling results (Ruzgien\u0117 et al., 2015). 285 and 300 images were converted in the western (Fig. 6A) and eastern (Fig. 6C) areas respectively.\nIn both the CGS and UAV DEMs data sets potential faults were identified as relatively straight lineaments in the topography that appear to cross-cut and offset stream valleys or intervening ridges. The attitudes of potential faults identified in the DEMs were estimated by importing kmz files into Google Earth and mapping the fault traces across differences in elevation. These differences were then used to construct a 3-point problem that defined the strike and dip of the fault (detail data can be found in the Supplementary material, Table S2). Lineaments identified in the DEMs and inferred to be faults are shown in Figs. 5 and 7\n; about 70% of the identified lineations yielded fault attitudes. In a few areas, subtle changes in grayscale also form lineations in map view and appear to represent planar features. These features, however, do not appear to offset ridges or valleys and appear to have 3-D geometries consistent with structural fabrics observed in the area (see lithologic layering and cleavage data in Table S3). These lineaments are therefore inferred to be metamorphic layering rather than faults.\nThe area around Jianming Lake shows several north-northeast to north-northwest trending lineaments that appear to be faults (Fig. 5). Structural analysis shows that the structures typically dip from 30\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 (Fig. 5; Table S2) and have normal displacements. These attitudes and kinematics are similar to the Phase 1 faults observed in the field (Fig. 4) but inconsistent the orientations of lithologic layering and penetrative fabrics mapped in the area.\nIn the UVA survey area west of Jiaming Lake (Fig. 6A), two subparallel lineaments trend NNE-NNW and are associated with east-dipping fault plane (Fig. 6A), the outcrop of one of the two fault scarps at the Jiaming Lake trail junction (white star) shows a steep, east-facing surface slope, the hanging wall lower the footwall suggesting an east-dipping normal fault (Fig. 6B). In the area east of the lake (Fig. 6B), the UAV survey revealed a NNE-trending lineation that appears to represent a west-dipping normal fault (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the lake has formed in graben or sag pond between adjacent faults.\nAn additional suite of lineaments and planar surfaces was identified in the area of the Chingsuei River east of the Jiaming Lake using the Lidar-based DEMs (Figs. 1 and 7). The DEM shows several south-dipping triangular-shaped slopes generally aligned parallel to each other are highlighted in Fig. 7. Additional surfaces with similar geometries appear to offset the interfluves north of the river and further upstream (background in Fig. 7). The remote location, dense vegetation, and rugged terrane limited field observations but data from the large facet in the foreground of Fig. 7A show evidence of a south-dipping normal fault (Table S1). Several additional locations along the river also show evidence for late-stage northeast-southwest extension (Fig. 7). We, therefore, interpret the east-west striking faceted topography as evidence of regional-scale normal fault that offsets the generally north-trending ridges or interfluves. The systematic decrease in elevation from north to south along the ridge crest near the contact between the Tailuko and Yuli Belts (Fig. 7) suggests several hundred meters to a kilometer of offset, which is consistent with the apparent offset of the quartz-mica schist member of Yuli Belt (Lin et al., 1984) in the foreground of Fig. 7. The geometries and kinematics of the proposed faults are also consistent with Phase 1 of the faults measured along the SXIH (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n4\nSurface strain-rate derived from GPS\nTo illustrate the surface strain rate field in southern Taiwan, we computed the 2D strain from the cGPS velocity field (Chen et al. (2017) using SSPX software (Cardozo and Allmendinger, 2009). Strain was computed using the Grid-Nearest Neighbor routine with a 10\u00a0km grid spacing, 6 neighbors, and a maximum radius of 30\u00a0km. The velocity field (relative to station TENC, near the top of Southern Cross-Island Highway), dilatation rate and extension axes are shown in Fig. 8A. With respect to Central Range, the stations in the fold-and-thrust belt and the Coastal Range show motions towards the Central Range. Stations within the southern Central Range and the southwest fold-and-thrust belt, however, show motions towards the southwest. Negative dilatation (contraction) occurs in western and eastern Taiwan, whereas positive dilatation (extension) occurs in the middle and southern Central Range (Fig. 8B). Positive dilatation is also present in the Ilan Plain and the area of the Okinawa Trough in northern Taiwan. The trends of the extension axes in central and southern Taiwan show three general patterns: N-S to NNE trends in western central Taiwan; E to ENE trends in southern Taiwan and a zone that grades between these two patterns in southwest Taiwan where extension trends NE. The dilatation rate combined with the extension direction suggest southwest movement of at least the upper crust.\n\n\n5\nStress analysis of earthquake focal mechanisms\nIn order to know the spatial distribution of stress states in the crust, we used first-motion polarities of P waves from Wu et al. (2008) to determine the focal mechanism solutions for earthquakes. We chose events with magnitudes ML\u00a0\u2265\u00a04.0 from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) catalog. Wu et al. (2008) implemented a genetic algorithm in a nonlinear global search for the focal-mechanism solutions (Wu et al., 2008). The earthquakes we used occurred in the southern Taiwan region between 1991 and 2016. We used the algorithm from Angelier (1979) to resolve the principal stress axes of the focal mechanisms of earthquakes, and delineated four deformation domains based primarily on earthquake kinematics: 1) Northwest (NW domain); 2) Central (CR domain); 3) Southwest (SW domain) and 4) Southeast (SE domain) (Fig. 9\n). To understand the vertical variations in stress, particularly an anomalous zone of NE-SW shortening in southwest Taiwan, we also analyzed the principal stress axes in four layers from 0 to 40\u00a0km depth in the southwest domain.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, earthquake focal mechanisms show normal, strike-slip, and thrust faults around the southern Central Range; the earthquakes in the NW, SW, and SE domain are dominated by strike-slip and thrust faulting, whereas the CR domain is dominated by strike-slip and normal faulting. This variation corresponds to thrust faulting and strike-slip faulting in the crust below lower elevations (below 1000\u00a0m) and normal faulting and strike-slip faulting in the crust below higher elevations (Fig. 9). The earthquakes are generally distributed between 1 and 30\u00a0km in depth except in the central domain where they are generally <10\u00a0km. We suggest it is noteworthy that the earthquakes with normal and strike-slip faulting mechanisms beneath the southern Central Range are restricted to shallow depths.\nHere, we perform stress analysis for different dominant types of focal mechanisms in the four domains (Fig. 10\n). In the northwest domain, the strike-slip faults show a NW-SE shortening (mean trend of 293\u00b0) and NE-SW extension (mean trend of 047\u00b0), and the thrust faults that show a NW-SE shortening (mean trend of 297\u00b0). In the southeast domain, the strike-slip faults show a NW-SE shortening (mean trend of 147\u00b0) and NE-SW extension (mean trend of 053\u00b0), and the thrust faults, show a NW-SE shortening (mean trend of 122\u00b0). Both domains show significant NW-SE compression subparallel to Philippine Sea plate motion relative to Eurasia. In the central domain, the strike-slip faults show a NW-SE shortening (mean trend of 125\u00b0) and NE-SW extension (mean trend of 220\u00b0), and the normal faults, show a NE-SW extension (mean trend of 047\u00b0). In the southwest domain, the strike-slip faults show NE-SW shortening (mean trend of 243\u00b0) and NW-SE extension (mean trend of 142\u00b0), and the thrust faults, show ENE-WSW shortening (mean trend of 265\u00b0). Overall, we document northwest-directed shortening in all areas except in the southwest domain where shortening is northeast-directed. The northeast-directed extension in the upper crust of the central domain, is consistent with our field data. The northwest shortening of the northwest and southeast domains is deeper and reflects deformation of the lower crust.\nIn order to examine the vertical distribution of stress and fault types in the southwest domain, we separated the focal mechanism into four depth layers above the 40\u00a0km (Fig. 11\n). Earthquakes between 0 and 20\u00a0km accommodate predominantly a mixture of reverse and strike-slip faulting, with only three events accommodating normal faulting between 10 and 20\u00a0km and only two accommodating reverse faulting between 0 and 10\u00a0km. The 20\u201330\u00a0km depth range is similarly dominated by a mixture of reverse and strike-slip faulting. Between 30 and 40\u00a0km, however, only 4 earthquakes reflect strike-slip faulting. Our finding of strike-slip faulting is similar to the result for different magnitudes of earthquakes in the southwest domain by Chen et al. (2017). In Fig. 11, the trend of the shortening direction differs slightly between strike-slip and thrust fault. For strike-slip faulting our results indicate NE shortening between depths of 10\u201330\u00a0km and NNE shortening between depths of 30\u201340\u00a0km, whereas for thrust faulting we find NW shortening shallower than 10\u00a0km and ENE shortening between depth of 10\u201340\u00a0km. Overall, the shortening varies from NW to NE to NNE, from the surface to 40\u00a0km depth.\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\n\n6.1\nRelative age of late-stage structures\nKinematic analysis of the field-based fault data indicates two phases of deformation, with phase 1 dominated by normal fault kinematics and phase 2 dominated by strike-slip kinematics (Fig. 4). Although we were not able to identify distinct crosscutting relations between the two phases, cross-cutting relations were observed or reasonably inferred along the western (Huang and Byrne, 2014) and central sections of the Southern Cross-Island Highway (Fig. 1B) (Crespi et al., 1996), and in the southern Central Range south of the study area (Mesalles, 2014). Applying these relations to the study area is consistent with the abundant evidence of normal slip in the area of Jiaming Lake (Fig. 5), the offset ridges and truncated spurs along the north bank of the Chingsuei River (Fig. 7) and the kinematics obtained from earthquake focal mechanisms in the upper crust of the southern Central Range (CR domain in Figs. 9 and 10). Taken together, the observations from the southern Central Range suggest that the upper crust is experiencing northeast-southwest extension and that this deformation was proceeded by conjugate strike-slip deformation that also was associated with northeast-southwest extension.\n\n\n6.2\nRegional-scale interpretations\nPrevious studies suggest that the extension in the Central Range resulted from: 1) tectonic extension driven by buoyancy forces or stress gradients (e.g., Chen et al., 2018; Lin, 2000), 2) gravitational collapse as the crust is over thickened by underplating (Crespi et al., 1996; Hsu et al., 2009), 3) regional-scale folding above a bending detachment (e.g., Carena et al., 2002), or 4) transtensional brittle deformation (Conand et al., 2020). Considering that the first three mechanisms predict extension orthogonal to the orogen (i.e., WNW to ESE), which is inconsistent with the results presented here, we first evaluate the transtensional model, then evaluate two alternative interpretations: gravitational collapse towards the SCS and tectonic extrusion orthogonal to the plate convergence vector.\n\nConand et al. (2020) proposed that extension in the Backbone Range was associated with regional-scale strike-slip deformation resulting from oblique convergence. The relatively small angle between the plate convergence vector and the orogen (\u223c15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0), however, would favor oblique subduction rather than any form of strain partitioning in the hanging wall (see for e.g., McCaffrey, 1992). GPS data in the core of the orogen also indicate shortening rather than transtension (Fig. 8B), suggesting that if transtension is a dominant process, it is limited to the southern Backbone Range. In addition, to our knowledge active regional-scale, strike-slip faults with significant offset have not been recognized in the orogen, although some faults have a component of oblique slip (e.g., the Longitudinal Valley fault). Finally, in the transtension model, normal faults and strike-slip faults with oblique-normal slip would appear to form contemporaneously and this is inconsistent with available observations that show cross-cutting relations (Crespi et al., 199; Huang and Byrne, 2014; Mesalles, 2014).\nAn alternative interpretation, is that Conand et al.'s data record two events: early, NW-SE shortening accommodated by conjugate strike-slip fault deformation followed by NE-SW extension accommodated by normal faulting.\n\n\n6.3\nGravitational flow to the southwest\nWe evaluate the gravitational flow of the orogen by comparing differences in gravitational potential energy (GPE) in the southern Central Range to the GPE of the South China Sea. The overall concept is that when comparing the GPE between any two columns of continental lithosphere, the column with the greater gravitational potential energy exerts a horizontal compressive deviatoric stress on the column with the lower gravitational potential energy (Platt and England, 1994). Thickening of the crust and growth of orogenic topography during the collision would have increased the gravitational potential energy in the Central Range (Lo and Hsu, 2005), and this difference in gravitational potential energy may cause material to flow in the SW direction, towards the South China Sea with a lower gravitational potential energy. It can be expressed by estimating the difference in gravitational potential energy between columns of the lithosphere in the southern Central Range and the South China Sea lithosphere. The method of calculation in this paper follows Molnar and Lyon-Caen (1988):\n\n\n\u2206\nGPE\n=\n\n\u222b\n\n\u2212\nh\n\n\n\nH\n0\n\n+\n\u2206\nH\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nc\n\ng\n\nx\n\ndx\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nw\n\ng\n\nx\n\n+\n\n\u03c1\nc\n\ng\n\nx\n\n+\n\n\u03c1\nm\n\ng\n\nx\n\n\n\ndx\n\n\nwhere \u03c1\n\nc\n is the density of the crust, \u03c1\n\nw\n is the density of the water, \u03c1\n\nm\n is the density of the mantle, g is the gravitational acceleration, h is the elevation, H\n0 is the crustal thickness, and \u2206H is the thickness of the crustal root. Given h=2.5\u00a0km, H\n0=30\u00a0km, \u2206H=10\u00a0km, \u03c1\n\nc\n=2750 kgm\n\u22123, \u03c1\n\nm\n=3400 kgm\n\u22123, \u03c1\n\nw\n=1050 kgm\n\u22123, and water depth is 3\u00a0km (Hsieh and Yen, 2016; Kuo-Chen et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2010).\nWe estimate the difference in gravitational potential energy between the southern Central Range and the South China Sea is about 1.64x1012Nm\u22121 (Fig. 12\n) which is consistent with the \u2206GPE reported in Chiang et al. (2016). This value is lower than the \u2206GPE between Tibet and Asia lithosphere (7.2x1012Nm\u22121), as well as lower than the \u2206GPE between the pre-extended back-arc basins and its surrounding lithosphere (5.5\u20137.0x1012Nm\u22121) in the world (Platt, 2007). In addition, it is also lower than the \u2206GPE in the present-day extended back-arc basins, such as Basin and Range Province (2.2x1012Nm\u22121), and the Mediterranean region (2.5x1012Nm\u22121) (Platt, 2007). However, the possibility of southwest extrusion of the southern Central Range, and by association NE extension in the upper crust is by gravitational collapse to the southwest, cannot be ruled out but the lower value suggests that its importance is relatively low.\n\n\n6.4\nTectonic extrusion\nAs an alternative interpretation based on the stress patterns interpreted from field and earthquake data (Figs. 4, 9 and 10), and building on the analysis of non-volcanic tremors in the core of the range (Chen et al., 2018; Ide et al., 2015), we propose that NE-SW extension in the upper crust is driven by the tectonic extrusion of lower crust towards the SW. We propose that as the north-trending Luzon Arc collides obliquely with the ENE-trending Peikang High, the southern Central Range is compressed between the NW and SE domains (Fig. 13A). Following Chen et al., 2018 and Ide et al., 2015, we propose that the tremors are part of a crustal-scale detachment that is imbricating the lower and middle crust. In this interpretation, pro-grade metamorphism may have released fluids that migrate vertically through a system of normal faults in the upper crust. We propose, here, that the detached block of crust recognized by Chen et al., 2018 may also be moving southwest perpendicular to the plate convergence direction and parallel to the subtle change in GPE. We base this interpretation primarily on the evidence for NE-SW extension in the upper crust. Vertical and lateral movement of the crust, however, is also consistent with evidence for relatively high heat flow, low Q (Lee et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010), low resistivity (Bertrand et al., 2012; Chiang et al., 2010), and a high geothermal gradient (Hsieh et al., 2014) at the northeastern end of the proposed extruding crust.\n\n\n6.5\nComparison with numerical modeling\nFinally, it is also insightful to compare the tectonic extrusion interpretation with numerical models of continental collisions. For example, Seyferth and Henk (2004) constructed a 3-D thermomechanical model using the finite element method and evaluated a range of parameters and boundary conditions. Their basic or \u201cstandard\u201d model (S-1) included orthogonal convergence and a free lateral margin. The free lateral boundary condition is particularly relevant to southern Taiwan as it may simulate the transition from the subduction of continental lithosphere in the southern Central Range to the subduction of oceanic lithosphere in the South China Sea south of the collision. Other models included variations in crustal temperature, rheology, convergence rate, and crust-mantle coupling. All of the models were run for 10\u00a0Ma and 200\u00a0km of convergence and yielded data sets on the spatial and temporal evolution of stress, strain, displacement and temperature. Although their results show substantial spatial and temporal variations in stress and strain, nearly all of the models show orogen-parallel extension, even during early stages of convergence, consistent with observations in Taiwan.\nIn comparing the different models in Seyferth and Henk (2004) to the observations in southern Taiwan in more detail, southern Taiwan generally lacks the high topography predicted in most of the models and southern Taiwan records significant orogen-parallel shortening in the transitional zone between collision and subduction (Figs. 10, 11 and 13; Chen et al., 2017). The relatively subdued topography in southern Taiwan, however, is consistent with model R-2 where crustal heat flow is relatively high compared to the classic model (S-1). The southern Central Range is also characterized by relatively high heat flow (Bertrand et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2018; Chiang et al., 2010; Hsieh et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010), suggesting that lateral flow of thermally weakened crust may account for the subdued topography in southwest Taiwan.\n\n\n6.6\nImplications and prediction tectonic extrusion\nAn additional aspect of the numerical modeling results is the predicted development of strike-slip faults on the east and west sides of the extruding block in southern Taiwan. Lacombe et al. (2001) also recognized the importance of strike-slip faults in accommodating crustal extrusion and suggested that their absence in southern Taiwan might be explained by the very recent development of the extruding block. We agree with this interpretation and note that the NE\u2013SW trending Chishan fault, a reverse fault with a right-lateral component (Lacombe et al., 2001), and the left-lateral shear of several watersheds along the eastern flank of the southern Backbone Range (Ramsey et al., 2007) may record the accommodation of the extruding block.\nTectonic extrusion also fails to replicate the orogen-parallel shortening beneath the coastal plain south of the Central Range (see, for example, the Meinong, Jianxing, and Wutai earthquakes in section A-A' Fig. 13) where orogen topography is more subdued. One possible interpretation is that this zone of mid-crustal shortening may reflect a change in rheology of the lower crust possibly related to lower heat flow away from the orogen, resulting in NE-SW compression in the lower crust.\nSouthwest extrusion of the lower crust beneath the southwest Taiwan (SW domain) is also inconsistent with the orientation of shear-wave (Vs) anisotropy in the crust of Taiwan (Huang et al., 2015). The Vs anisotropy models show the fast directions in the lower crust (13\u201330\u00a0km depth) are parallel to the current plate convergence vector whereas the tectonic extrusion model predicts flow to the southwest. Although a full analysis is beyond this paper, we note that southwest extrusion may have developed relatively recently whereas velocity anisotropies, because they represent penetrative rock fabrics, develop over geologic time (e.g., millions of years).\n\n\n6.7\nTiming of extrusion\nAll of the normal fault systems described here appear to be relatively young which is consistent with the interpreted onset of extrusion in southwest Taiwan in the late Pleistocene based on offset sediments (Lacombe et al., 2001). Extending the region of extrusion into the southern Central Range, as we are proposing here, allows the application of additional temporal constraints for both extrusion and uplift of the range. For example, Hsu et al. (2016) proposed an acceleration of exhumation cooling at about 0.5\u00a0Ma based on totally reset detrital zircon (youngest age: 0.425\u00a0Ma) and apatite ages (youngest age: 0.25\u00a0Ma) from the area of Small Ghost Lake (location in Fig. 1). A relatively young age for uplift (and southwest extrusion) is consistent with the southward tilt of watersheds in the southern Central Range (Ramsey et al., 2007) and the progressive increase in rates of erosion and exhumation cooling from the Hengchun Peninsula to the South Cross-Island Highway (Chen et al., 2021; Derrieux et al., 2014).\nAnother approach to constraining the age of uplift of the southern Central Range is to use the rates of rock uplift along the SXIH, based on leveling data (Hsu et al., 2018). Using a rate of 5\u201310\u00a0mm\/yr and the current elevation of the range (\u223c3000\u00a0m) suggests uplift may have started 0.7 to 0.3\u00a0Ma which is consistent with the zircon and apatite data (Hsu et al., 2016). An intriguing interpretation, therefore, is that the topographic growth of the Central Range occurred less than a million years ago. If this is correct, the growth of the range is substantially younger than the often stated 5\u20136\u00a0Ma initial from north or simultaneous (Lee et al., 2015; Suppe, 1984; Teng, 1990). In this context uplift and southwest extrusion of the southern Central Range may represent southward propagation of the colliding orogen (Suppe, 1981) or a very recent change in the motion of the Philippine Sea Plate relative to Eurasia (e.g., < 1\u00a0Ma, Byrne et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nThe detailed analysis of regional- and outcrop-scale fault data reveals the late-stage brittle faults are predominantly normal faults and have geometries and kinematics that are consistent with leveling, GPS-based strain rate, and earthquake data across the range. The geometry and kinematics are also consistent with stress patterns inferred from ambient tremors that suggest extension in the upper crust and contraction in the lower crust. Kinematic analysis of field-fault data indicates that the upper crust of the internal area of the southern Taiwan orogen is controlled by a NE-SW extensional stress regime. This NE-SW extension is consistent with the SW direction movement of the lower crust beneath the southern Central Range and contraction direction beneath southwest Taiwan.\nBased upon analysis of geological, structural, seismic, and geodetic data from southern Taiwan, we propose a tectonic model in which the crust in southern Taiwan is shortened between the obliquely colliding Peikang High and the Luzon Arc and that shortening is accommodated by SW-directed lateral and vertical movement of the lower crust. The normal faults with the northeast extension in the southern Central Range reflect the consequence of the SW lateral and vertical movement of the lower crust. Essentially, the vertical movement of the rocks results in the permutation of the principal stresses through time with \u03c31, inferred to be horizontal as the conjugate strike-slip faults formed during NE-SW compression, becoming vertical as the normal faults form. One interpretation of this permutation that is consistent with the states of stress outlined above, is the movement of rocks from the middle to the upper crust as the southern Central Range thickened during convergence. Based on an acceleration of exhumation cooling at about 0.5\u00a0Ma in the southern Central Range and the onset of extrusion in southwest Taiwan in the late Pleistocene, we infer that this SW extrusion process may be younger the 0.5\u00a0Ma. Finally, this very recent initiation of SW extrusion of lower crust has not significantly shaped the existing structural pattern in the upper crust of southwestern Taiwan. In fact, better understanding the relation between extrusion and the development of the fold-and-thrust belt in the western foothills is an area of exciting future research.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nWei-Hao Hsu: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Visualization, Project administration, Supervision.

This issue has become a societal concern due to the increasing interest in geothermal energy (e.g., Grigoli et al., 2017; Terakawa et al., 2012), CO2 storage (Zoback and Gorelick, 2012), or injection of waste waters associated with hydraulic fracking (Ellsworth, 2013). Natural and artificial sources of fluid can elevate pore-fluid, which can destabilize active faults through either slow-slip or fast, seismic-wave-producing rupture events perceived as earthquakes. Examples of fluid-driven seismic and aseismic slip on natural faults are related to seismic swarms (e.g., Roland and McGuire, 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Hainzl, 2004; Hatch et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2020), aftershock sequences (e.g., Nur and Booker, 1972; Ross et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2004; Miller, 2020), and other natural phenomena such as slow-slip events and tectonic tremors (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018; Jolivet and Frank, 2020; Behr and B\u00fcrgmann, 2021). On the other hand, fluid injections associated with human activities are well known to lead to the reactivation of faults, slow-slip transients, and earthquakes, which occasionally are large enough to cause damage (e.g., Guglielmi et al., 2015; Deichmann and Giardini, 2009; Ellsworth et al., 2019; Keranen et al., 2013, 2014; Raleigh et al., 1976; Bao and Eaton, 2016). Taken together, this body of work suggest that fluid-driven seismic and aseismic fault slip in nature and anthropogenic fluid injections are closely linked.\nThe propagation of fluid-driven shear cracks, the evolution of pore pressure, and the poroelastic response of faults, have been subjects of interest for decades in the earthquake modeling community (e.g., Rice and Cleary, 1976; Rice, 1992; Dunham and Rice, 2008; Rudnicki and Rice, 2006; Cruz-Atienza et al., 2018; Heimisson et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020; Petrini et al., 2020). Recent modeling efforts have mostly focused on the stability of frictional slip when a fluid is locally injected and diffuses within a fault (Bhattacharya and Viesca, 2019; Cappa et al., 2018; Garagash and Germanovich, 2012; Larochelle et al., 2021; Yang and Dunham, 2021), or when fluid injection initiates shear cracks on a strengthening rate-and-state frictional fault (Dublanchet, 2019). Despite the apparent relevance of fluid-driven slow and fast slip transients in a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic environments, the spatio-temporal evolution of sequences of seismic and aseismic slip in response to pore-fluid evolution remains poorly constrained. This is, in part, due to the challenge of solving a fully coupled solid-fluid system in which the dynamic evolution of fault slip, stress, pore-fluid pressure, and shear strength are unknown.\nIn this study, we present H-MEC (Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a continuum-based modeling approach to solve fully dynamic sequences of seismic and aseismic slip (SEAS) in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium with rate-dependent strength, which considerably extends our previous numerical model developed for incompressible media with rate-independent strength (Petrini et al., 2020). The computational framework is developed for the two-dimensional plane strain problem on a simplified strike-slip fault. Our coupled system utilizes Global Picard-iterations with a fully implicit adaptive time to efficiently solve all stages of the earthquake cycle. We apply a staggered finite difference\u2013marker-in-cell (SFD-MIC) method, as it is easy to implement, flexible, and the marker-in-cell technique is often used to resolve highly deforming materials, such as faults and geologic structures (Gerya and Yuen, 2007; Petrini et al., 2020).\nThe goal of this study is to provide a quantitative set of numerical experiments in which we test analytical benchmarks and illustrative examples of sequences of seismic and aseismic slip along with results from the solid-fluid coupling, fluid transport on- and off-fault, pore pressure evolution, and fault slip. Our focus is to demonstrate the validity of our methodology and highlight the mechanical response of a fault zone from the solid-fluid coupling. We apply this methodology in the context of a simple, 2-D plane strain model of a strike-slip fault in a homogeneous bulk domain, which is an idealization of a natural strike-slip fault. In Section 2, we present the conceptual and mathematical model and state the continuum problem solved in this work. In Section 3, we present results of two analytical benchmarks and a set of simulations of earthquake sequences. In Section 4 we analyze and interpret the results and compare solutions for different confining pressure, solid and fluid compressibility, porosity, and fracture energy.

The effective bulk modulus of pores (K\n[\u03d5]), as well as the effective visco-plastic compaction viscosity (\u03b7\n[\u03d5]) are computed following Yarushina and Podladchikov (2015) and Petrini et al.

In this study m takes a value of 1 (i.e., cylindrical pores), which reduces Eqs. (9a) and (9b) to \u03bc*\/\u03d5 and \u03b7\n\ns(vp)\/\u03d5. The visco-plastic effective shear viscosity in Eq. (9b) is a key component of our rheological model. In particular, the documented self-pressurization of a plastically yielding fault is a direct consequence of the assumed decrease of pores resistance to visco-plastic compaction (i.e., the decrease in \u03b7\n[\u03d5]) caused by the decrease in the visco-plastic shear resistance \u03b7\n\ns(vp) during yielding.\nFor in-plane (mode-II) slip, the effective shear modulus, i.e., the elastic modulus for quasi-static plane strain deformation (Rubin and Ampuero, 2007), is equal to\n\n(10)\n\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\nWhere \u03bd is Poisson's ratio and \u03bc is the shear modulus.\nThe continuity equations of both solid (Eq. (3)) and fluid (Eq. (4)) contain poroelasticity terms consistent with Biot's theory (Biot, 1941; Gassmann, 1951; Yarushina and Podladchikov, 2015), which allow for compressibility of the solid matrix and fluid as well as viscous and elastic (de)compaction of the porous space. Being Eqs. (3) and (4) fully coupled, convergence and divergence of the vector flow occur as a result of compaction\/decompaction processes, which results in a fully coupled hydro-mechanical system.\n\n\n2.2\nVisco-elasto-plastic rheology\nComponents of the deviatoric deformation (strain rate) tensor are defined upon the assumption of infinitesimal strain as follows:\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\nij\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ni\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\nj\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nj\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nx\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n3\n\nTr\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\nij\n\n,\n\n\nwhere i and j are arbitrary indexes and x\n\ni\n and x\n\nj\n are the 2-D spatial coordinates defining the tensor components.

As a result, plastic yielding can spontaneously localize anywhere (Dal Zilio et al., 2022). Furthermore, the rate-dependent strength (Eq. (16)) relies on the presence of \u03b3, which mimic the positive direct effect in the rate- and state-dependent friction formulation (e.g., Scholz, 1998), a feature that has ample laboratory confirmation (Dieterich, 1979, 1981; Ruina, 1983; Marone, 1998). On the other hand, our rate-dependent strength formulation does not require the presence of an evolutionary effect involving a decrease in friction. This is because the weakening mechanism in our fully coupled system is controlled by the evolution of pore-fluid pressure (p\n[f]), which is encapsulated in \u03c4\n0 (Eq. (18)).\nThe non-associated plastic flow law is defined through the plastic flow potential (Q), which reflects the amount of mechanical energy per unit volume that supports plastic deformation (Vermeer, 1998)\n\n(20)\n\nQ\n=\n\n\u03c4\nII\n\n\u2212\nsin\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n\n(\n\np\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\ncos\n(\n\u03c8\n)\nc\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere we assume that the dilation angle \u03c8 is zero.

To accomplish this, we require that the time step is the minimum of the time steps needed to resolve (1) the slip acceleration on the fault (\u0394t\ns), (2) the displacement per grid cell (\u0394t\nd), and (3) the visco-elasto-plastic time step (\u0394t\nvep) as\n\n(35)\n\n\u0394\nt\n=\nmin\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\u0394\n\nt\ns\n\n\n,\n\n\u0394\n\nt\nd\n\n\n,\n\n\u0394\n\nt\nvep\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe first time step requires that the slip acceleration per time step is limited to a fraction of the grid size as\n\n(36)\n\n\u0394\n\nt\ns\n\n=\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n\u03b4\nd\n\n\n\n\nV\nmax\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b4\n\nd\n\n=10\u22125 defines the maximum grid fraction. Similarly, we require that the displacement per time step is limited by the same fraction of the grid size\n\n(37)\n\n\u0394\n\nt\nd\n\n=\n\n\u03b4\nd\n\nmin\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n\nV\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\ny\n\n\n\nV\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nBased on a previous study (Herrend\u00f6rfer, 2018), we apply a visco-elasto-plastic time step to capture the relaxation time scale \u03b7\nvp\/\u03bc* by a fraction \u03be\n\n\n(38)\n\n\u0394\n\nt\nvep\n\n=\n\u03be\n\n\n\n\u03b7\nvep\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03be\n=0.2. Notably, the visco-elasto-plastic relaxation time step combines both the visco-elastic relaxation \u03b7\nvep\/\u03bc* and the elasto-plastic relaxation time scale\n\n(39)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nII\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c4\nII\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\u02d9\n\n\nij\n\u2032\n\n]\n\nplastic\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, \u0394t\nvep provides a constraint on the final time step when viscous deformation is dominant, thus ensuring the resolution of the relaxation time. Importantly, we do not apply any minimum time step cutoff. This is in contrast to previous studies (e.g., Lapusta and Liu, 2009), in which the time step is only adapted until it reaches \u0394t\nmin\n=(1\/3)\u0394\nx\n\/c\n\ns\n, where c\n\ns\n is the shear wave speed (see Table 1). We do not adopt a minimum time step cutoff because during the propagation of fully dynamic ruptures the actual time step can decreases below the \u0394t\nmin threshold. As a result, applying a cutoff would reduces the convergence rate during Picard iterations (Section 2.3).\n\n\n2.5\nModel setup and boundary conditions\nThe 2-D model setup consists of a strike-slip fault (Fig. 1\n). We consider a mode-II plane strain shear motion along a planar interface embedded in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic medium (Fig. 1). We utilize a x\n\u2212\ny Cartesian coordinate system with y\n=0 being the sliding interface. This simple setup is designed to enable comparison to both analytical benchmarks for numerical solution and classical earthquake cycle simulations and theoretical estimates of the critical length scales during nucleation and propagation of dynamic ruptures (e.g., Lapusta et al., 2000). Parameters and physical constants are given in Table 1.\nThe system of equations over the domain \u03a9=[0, L\n\nx\n]\u00d7[0, L\n\ny\n] is solved by using specific boundary conditions for pressure and velocity (Fig. 1). For the model setup of this study, the conditions on the left (x\n=0) and right (x\n=\nL\n\nx\n) boundaries are open and allow for horizontal shear:\n\n\n\n\n(40a)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n(40b)\n\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nL\nx\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\u2202\n\nv\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nL\nx\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis condition implies that the velocity component parallel to the boundary is constant (zero shear stress), whereas the velocity component normal to the boundary does not change across the boundary. The fault is loaded from the upper (y\n=0) and lower boundaries (y\n=\nL\n\ny\n) by applying a constant loading rate in the form of Dirichlet boundary conditions and assuming zero velocity on the vertical component \n\nv\ny\n\n (Fig. 1):\n\n\n\n\n(41a)\n\n\nv\nx\n\n=\n+\n\n1\n2\n\n\nV\npl\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n,\n\nv\ny\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n;\n\n\n\n(41b)\n\n\nv\nx\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n;\n\nV\npl\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n\nL\ny\n\n\n\n\n,\ny\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n\nL\ny\n\n\n\n;\n\n\n\nwhere V\npl\n=6.3 cm yr\u22121 is the constant loading rate.\nPressure boundary conditions have to be defined for both total (p\n[t]) and fluid (p\n[f]) pressure. Since the solid mass (Eq. (3)) and fluid mass (Eq. (4)) are intrinsically coupled, we first initialize the fluid pressure with a constant confining pressure (p\nconf) and then we apply a constant effective pressure (p\neff) on the top and lower boundary:\n\n(42)\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n=\n\np\neff\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n,\ny\n=\n\nL\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluid momentum (Eq.

In particular, we consider two benchmark exercises (BP1 and BP2) from a set of quasi-static problems in a 2-D domain with a 1-D fault subjected to perturbations of fluid injection and along-fault pore-fluid diffusion. In order to verify these two benchmarks, we modify the model setup given in Section 2.5 by including an injection point on the left boundary (Fig. 2\na).\nFor the first benchmark problem (BP1), injection is modeled as a source of constant fluid pressure (\u0394p\n[f]) at x\n\ninj\n\n=\nx\n(0). The resulting pore-fluid pressure diffusion along the interface can be solved analytically as (e.g., Viesca, 2021)\n\n(45)\n\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n=\n\np\n0\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n+\n\u0394\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\u00b7\nerfc\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n|\nx\n|\n\n\n\nl\nd\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere erfc is the complementary error function, \n\nl\nd\n\n(\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n4\n\n\u03b1\n\nt\n\n\n is the diffusion lengthscale, and \u03b1 is the constant hydraulic diffusivity\n\n(46)\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\n\n\nk\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n*\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03b7\n[f] is the viscosity of the permeating fluid and \u03b2* is a storage coefficient reflecting the compressibility of the fluid and porous matrix. On the other hand, the second benchmark problem (BP2) assumes a constant volume rate injection from a point source (x\n\ninj\n\n=\nx\n(0)), and the flow solution is given by Carslaw and Jaeger (1959):\n\n(47)\n\np\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\np\n0\n\n=\n\n\n\nQ\nw\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03c0\n\nk\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\nh\n\n\n\nE\n1\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nx\n\u2212\n\nx\ninj\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u03b1\nt\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \n\nQ\nw\n\n is the constant injection volume rate, h is the fault thickness, and E1 is the exponential integral function. Note that the fault hydraulic transmissivity represents the product k\n[\u03d5]\n\nh.\nFor both benchmarks BP1 and BP2, fluid is injected into the fault and it is constrained to flow only within its hydraulic aperture, a scenario that would occur when the permeability of the host rock is negligible relative to the fault itself (i.e. no fluid leak-off). Also, the fault is assumed marginally pressurized \u2014 that is, \u0394p\n[f] is always below the total pressure (in order to avoid hydraulic fracturing). Fig. 2 shows the results from the BP1 (Fig. 2b) and BP2 (Fig. 2c) and demonstrates the high accuracy of the numerical solution, which overlaps with the analytical solutions at different time stages. It is worth noting that the exponential integral function in Eq. (47) is singular at the injection point x\n=\nx\n\ninj\n (Fig. 2c). This means that, for the case of injection experiments at constant volume rate, the fluid pressure at the origin is unbounded.\n\n\n3.2\nEarthquake cycles\nThe long-term response of the fault to slow loading rate is characterized by periods of quasi-static deformation followed by slip events, either slow or fast (Fig. 3\na\u2013c), in which the slip rate on the fault accelerates from \u223ccm yr\u22121 to \u223cm s\u22121 (Fig. 3d). As a result, the adaptive time step is large (fraction of a year) during the inter-seismic periods, and small (milliseconds) during the occurrence of dynamic rupture (Fig. 3e). Similarly, the effective pressure (p\n[t]\n\u2212\np\n[f]) drops by \u223c20 MPa as a result of the poroelastic response of the fault zone during fast shearing (Fig. 3f).\nSlip history on the fault indicate that, when assuming homogeneous properties, regular cycles of complete ruptures arises from the numerical experiments (Fig. 4\n). While the imposed loading rate increases stress linearly with time, slip rate increases exponentially on both the left and right side of the fault, i.e., where \u03b3 is high (Fig. 1b). Consequently, the two lateral segments of the fault steadily creep at rates comparable to the imposed loading rate (Fig. 4a), the seismogenic zone remains locked during inter-seismic periods and stress concentrates at the transition between high and low \u03b3. In the later stages of the inter-seismic periods, the rate-strengthening behavior allows creep to penetrate from both the left and the right segments towards the center of the fault, thus leading to a mechanical erosion of the locked patch. Due to a relatively large critical nucleation size (L\n\nc\n, Eq. (51)), seismic events nucleate at the center of the seismogenic zone and the resulting dynamic ruptures typically propagate in a bilateral and symmetric fashion (Fig. 4a). For the reference model, the average slip rate is 0.82 m s\u22121, whereas the average rupture speed is \u223c2.35 km s\u22121.\nEvolution of the cumulative slip over multiple earthquake cycles is displayed in Fig. 4b. In particular, the accumulation of slip during the inter-seismic periods is represented by gray lines, which are plotted every 4 years, whereas the co-seismic slip is displayed every 0.4 s when the fault slip exceeds the following threshold (V\n\nth\n)\n\n(48)\n\n\nV\nth\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03b3\n\np\neff\n\n\nc\ns\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n,\n\n\nwhich, according to our parameters, yields to a threshold of 8.1 cm s\u22121. When the fault is experiencing a seismic event, the cumulative slip on the fault indicates that a complete fault rupture produces \u223c5 m of slip, which is followed by a transient post-seismic deformation of \u223c0.8\u20131 m (blue lines; Fig. 4b). Our models show that dynamic ruptures occur due to an abrupt increase of pore-fluid pressure within the fault zone (Fig. 5\na). The increase in pore-fluid pressure is simultaneously coupled to a rapid decrease in shear strength (Fig. 5b) and both shear and compaction viscosity (Fig. 5c), which are self-sustained by a localized strain rate. When an event begins to propagate dynamically, it produces a shear stress breakdown from its maximum static value to a low, dynamic value (Fig. 5b). Notably, at co-seismic slip rates, the effective shear viscosity drops by roughly 10 orders of magnitude (Fig. 5c), whereas static stress change immediately after the event results in a stress concentration at the transition between the lateral creeping segments and the seismogenic zone.\nTo investigate the influence that pore-fluid pressure level has on the spontaneous activation of seismic and aseismic slip on the fault, we perform further numerical experiments in which we increase (model M2) and decrease the effective pressure (p\neff) (model M3) compared to the value used for the reference model (Fig. 6\n). The two models illuminate the effect of pore-fluid pressure throughout the earthquake cycle, from the recurrence period to the nucleation phase of seismic events, as well as the relation between seismic and aseismic slip. In model M2 (Fig. 6b), due to a lower pore-fluid pressure, the effective pressure on the fault is higher (p\neff\n= 60 MPa), and consequently the critical nucleation size decreases. As a result, seismic events nucleate earlier than in the reference model (Fig. 3d). The smaller nucleation size combined with a slightly asymmetric fault structure (Fig. 1b) allow seismic ruptures to nucleate on one side of the seismogenic fault and propagate unilaterally on the other side of the fault segment in an asymmetric fashion. On the other hand, model M3 (Fig. 6c) assumes a higher pore-fluid pressure, which results in a lower effective pressure (p\neff\n= 20 MPa). In this case, the average shear strength is significantly lower than in model M2 and plastic yielding occurs more easily. Consequently, the seismogenic zone promotes unstable slip, either as seismic partial ruptures or as slow-slip transients. The long-term slip history indicates a mixture of fast and slow events, with a recurrence interval that vary over time. These results are important, as they suggest that pore-fluid pressure evolution in the same fault segment can release tectonic stress through both slow and fast ruptures, without incorporating any rate- and state-dependent friction.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nPoro-visco-elasto-plastic (de)compaction and propagation of solitary pressure waves\nA large body of theoretical work has explored the physics of solid-fluid interaction in active faults and earthquake source processes (e.g., and references therein Rice and Simons, 1976; Rice, 1992; Segall and Rice, 1995; Garagash and Rudnicki, 2003; Dunham and Rice, 2008; Liu and Rubin, 2010; Miller, 2013). In particular, a number of studies have focused on the relationship between porosity evolution, (de)compaction of reologically complex visco-(elasto)-plastic porous media, and fluid transport through the propagation of porosity waves (e.g., Connolly and Podladchikov, 2000, 2007; Cruz-Atienza et al., 2018, 2018; Yarushina and Podladchikov, 2015; Skarbek and Rempel, 2016; Petrini et al., 2020; Dal Zilio and Gerya, 2022).\nAccording to our results, it appears clear that visco-plastic compaction of fluid-filled porous media can lead to an abrupt self-pressurization of the fault zone, particularly under undrained conditions or when the permeability on the fault is sufficiently low to prevent fluid flux on the boundaries of the fault zone on the timescale of seismic ruptures. As a result, the self-pressurization of the fault zone can trigger the propagation of solitary pressure waves, which can travel at co-seismic speed. To analyze the effect of solid-fluid (de)compaction, we quantify the separate contributions of visco-plastic compaction of the solid skeleton (\u03b6\n[vp]) and the decompaction of the fluid phase (\u03b6\n[e]) as follow:\n\n(49)\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n[\nvp\n]\n\n\n=\n\n\n\np\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n[\n\u03d5\n]\n\n\n\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n(50)\n\n\n\u03b6\n\n[\ne\n]\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n[\nd\n]\n\n\n\n(\n(\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n\u2212\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n[\nt\n]\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n(\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n+\n\np\n\n|\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n[\n\nf\n\n\n]\n\n\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n(De)compaction along the fault during a representative major event is shown in Fig. 7\n. Temporal evolution of the slip velocity displays a large event propagating unilaterally from the left to the right side of the seismogenic zone (Fig. 7a). An accurate quantification of visco-plastic compaction from Eq. (49) and elastic decompaction from Eq. (50) indicates that plastic yielding during the gradual nucleation phase is associated with a rapid increase in solid compaction (Fig. 7b), which is followed by a negative increase of fluid decompaction (Fig. 7c). As a result, pore-fluid pressure on the fault increases while shear strength decreases, thus causing a shear instability. Such shear instability grows on a relatively short time scale, causing the propagation of a dynamic rupture in the form of a pulse-like pressure wave (Fig. 7d). Notably, the strain difference between the elastic decompaction and the visco-plastic compaction represents the finite pore volume change. The combination of these two interconnected processes results in a small change in porosity and, in turn, permeability (Eq. (5)). Furthermore, a dynamic rupture causes an increased in pore-fluid pressure due to elastically stressed pores, which is better resolved by our fully compressible model with rate dependent strength compared to the previous simplified incompressible formulation (Petrini et al., 2020). Such increases in pore-fluid pressure are released over a relatively long diffusion period, which essentially depends on the permeability of both the host rock and the fault zone.\nIt is important to note that the magnitude of visco-plastic and elastic (de)compaction depend on the compressibility of both the solid skeleton (\u03b2\n[s]) and the fluid phase (\u03b2\n[f]), as they have a direct impact on the Biot-Willis coefficient (\u03b1; Eq. (6b)), and the Skempton coefficient (B; Eq. (6c)). To quantify the role of solid and fluid compressibility, we execute two parameter studies of solid-fluid compressibility assuming two end-member porosities (i.e., 1% and 10%; Tewksbury-Christle and Behr, 2021), knowing that in nature the compressibility of porous rocks, and in particular fluids, can vary up to two orders of magnitude (e.g., Zimmerman et al., 1986; Span and Wagner, 1996; Mitchell and Soga, 2005). Our models produce distinctly different slip patterns within the range of solid-fluid compressibility (Fig. 8\n). As illustrated in Fig. 8a, an increase in fluid compressibility leads to a transition from regular seismic events, to slow-slip events and eventually stable creep. In contrast, solid compressibility plays only a subordinate role. Furthermore, when we increase the reference porosity from 1% to 10% (Fig. 8b), the parameter space in which we observe slow-slip events broaden. While high porosity serves as a damping factor to suppress the self-pressurization of pore-fluid and thus the occurrence of fast events, these results indicate that fluid compressibility can significantly affect the slip response of a fault loaded by tectonic stresses. As such, the higher the fluid compressibility, the lower the self-pressurization of the fault zone. Our numerical results can thus reproduce the full spectrum of fault slip behaviors under geophysically relevant conditions of pore-fluid pressure and fault composition, from slow to fast events, as observed for tectonic faults (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018; Obara and Kato, 2016; Jolivet and Frank, 2020).\n\n\n4.2\nNucleation length, cohesive zone size, and fracture energy\nThe computational framework presented here is capable of resolving long-term deformation histories with continuous aseismic creep in the stable rate-strengthening fault regions throughout the loading period, nucleation of shear instabilities, co-seismic propagation of seismic ruptures, and post-seismic relaxation. As the considered example shown in Fig. 9\n, the algorithm is formulated with a rate-strengthening yield strength (Eq. (16)), in which the rate-strengthening exponent (\u03b3) is decisive for its success to reproduce long-term inter-seismic periods with essentially quasi-static deformation, aseismic slip, and most importantly, gradual nucleation of dynamic ruptures (Fig. 9a) (e.g., Dieterich, 1992; Lapusta et al., 2000). However, compared to the formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction laws (e.g., Scholz, 1998), the evolutionary effect during the weakening phase is controlled by self-pressurization of pore-fluid pressure.\nOur models indicate that shear cracks would become unstable when they reach the critical nucleation length (L\n\nc\n) proposed by Andrews (1976), in which shear strength linearly decreases from static shear strength (\u03c4\n\ns\n) to a relatively low dynamic shear strength (\u03c4\n\nd\n) over a characteristic slip weakening distance (d\n\nc\n) (Ida, 1972)\n\n(51)\n\n\nL\nc\n\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n)\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c4\n0 represents the initial shear stress (Eq. (18)). According to our model (Fig. 9a), Eq (51) predicts a critical nucleation length of \u223c7.3 km. Comparing Fig. 4a and Fig. 6a with Fig. 9a, we notice that slip during and right after the nucleation phase are very similar despite the different critical nucleation length. This means that observing signals from the nucleation of fluid-driven shear cracks do not provide any evidence on the final size of the event. This suggests that the final size of seismic events is determined by the conditions on the fault, rather than by the nucleation process itself.\n\nFig. 9b illustrates the weakening phases that buffer the pore pressure and slip velocity rise, leading to dynamic rupture. During Phase I, upon rapid loading, shear stress rises abruptly with strain as the fault is elastically loaded previous to the onset of slip. Phase II is characterized by a strain-hardening shear strength, which produces an early phase of slip (<1 cm of slip), and corresponds roughly to slip rates of the order of 1\u201310 cm s\u22121. During Phase III, an abrupt weakening is initiated and shear strength drops while slip rate quickly accelerates up to \u223cm\/s. Peak in slip rate is reached when strength drop is completed, which is follow by a quasi steady-state phase where low shear strength is maintained with minor fluctuations.\nDuring the nucleation phase of a seismic event, slip velocity increases rapidly while shear stress drops significantly. Since the rupture speed during this phase is still close to zero, the critical distance along which the shear stress drops represents the quasi static cohesive zone length (\u039b). The cohesive zone size is an important resolution criterion in dynamic rupture because it provides the critical spatial length scale over which the shear stress drops at the propagating rupture front (Palmer and Rice, 1973; Day et al., 2005). Since fluid-driven shear cracks essentially mimic a linear slip-weakening law (Fig. 9c), the cohesive zone sizes at rupture speed c\n=0+ (\u039b0) observed in our simulations correspond quite well to the estimate proposed by Day et al. (2005):\n\n(52)\n\n\n\u039b\n0\n\n=\n\n\n9\n\u03c0\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n*\n\n\nd\nc\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere 9\u03c0\/32 is a constant if the stress traction distribution within the cohesive zone is linear in space (Palmer and Rice, 1973). This latter study establishes that \u039b0\/\u0394x of 3 to 5 is required to resolve dynamic rupture. The ratio of nucleation zone size and cohesive zone size (\u039b0\/L\n\nc\n) is between 0.3 and 0.5, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Lapusta et al., 2000). Therefore, resolving the cohesive zone is the most important critical length scale. In our simulations, we choose a cell size of \u0394x=100 m, which allows us to resolve the cohesive zone of 2.5 km with at least 25 cells.\nSeismic ruptures are controlled by an energy balance involving elastic work, wave radiation, and dissipation by anelastic processes, including friction and plastic strain. As illustrated in Fig. 9c, the frictional work during the weakening process \u2014 as the product of shear stress and slip \u2014 equates to a simple form of fracture energy (G\u2032), which assumes a linear slip weakening (Palmer and Rice, 1973; Andrews, 1976; Okubo and Dieterich, 1984)\n\n(53)\n\n\nG\n\u2032\n\n(\n\u03b4\n)\n=\n\n\u222b\n0\n\u03b4\n\n[\n\u03c4\n(\n\n\u03b4\n\u2032\n\n)\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n(\n\u03b4\n)\n]\n\nd\n\n\u03b4\n\u2032\n\n\u2248\n\n1\n2\n\n(\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\nd\n\n)\n\nd\nc\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo compare our modeling results with existing measurements of fracture energy from earthquakes globally, we compile fracture energy estimates made previously with events spanning five orders of magnitude in size, from borehole microseismicity to great earthquakes (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005; Rice, 2006; Malagnini et al., 2014; Viesca and Garagash, 2015; Nielsen et al., 2016a; Tinti et al., 2005) (Fig. 10\n). Previous inferences have shown a nonlinear scaling of fracture energy with slip (Abercrombie and Rice, 2005), from G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2 for small earthquakes to G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2\/3 for large earthquakes (Fig. 10), which has been attributed to thermal pressurization of pore-fluid by the rapid shear heating of fault gouge (Viesca and Garagash, 2015). For the set of parameters considered in this study, our models produce both relatively large stress drop (\u03c4\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n\u03c4\n\nd\n) and large characteristic slip weakening distance (d\n\nc\n), which results in high values of fracture energy (Fig. 9c). Remarkably, the range of fracture energy and slip from our dynamic analysis supports the observed G\n\u221d\n\u03b4\n2\/3 scaling of fracture energy for large earthquakes, and suggests that self-pressurization of fluids is a viable mechanism for explaining widespread and prominent process of fault weakening.\nIt is important to note that in our models d\n\nc\n is not a constant, as it is treated as variable and it is dynamically determined during rupture the itself (Fig. 9c). The weakening distance d\n\nc\n has been widely used in fault studies and often imposed as a constant (e.g., Tse and Rice, 1986; Ben-Zion and Rice, 1995; Lapusta et al., 2000; Rubin and Ampuero, 2005; Lapusta and Liu, 2009). However, ample observations suggest that d\n\nc\n should be treated as a variable (Cocco and Bizzarri, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2010), since the effective weakening distance depends on slip history and loading conditions (e.g., Guatteri et al., 2001; Tinti et al., 2004). Furthermore, laboratory measures of d\n\nc\n using rotary friction experiments performed at seismic slip rates (\u223c1 m s\u22121) yield weakening distances of the order of meters (and references therein Nielsen et al., 2016a), substantial friction drops (Di Toro et al., 2011), and fracture energies arguably in the same order as the seismological estimates (Nielsen et al., 2016b).\n\n\n4.3\nFuture avenues for research\nDespite the simple setup, the proposed methodology can be used to investigate a number of different problems related to solid-fluid interactions, e.g., fluid-driven swarms, aftershocks, and foreshock sequences (e.g., Ross et al., 2020; Miller, 2020). Furthemore, the developed methodology presents a promising avenue for investigating slip that occurs in response to fluid injection into a permeable fault governed by either rate-strengthening yield strength or rate-and-state friction (e.g., Yang and Dunham, 2021). It is important to note that inelastic changes of permeability and porosity, which can arise from shear-induced dilatancy (e.g., Segall and Rice, 1995), have been neglected for simplicity. Future research will focus on the dynamic evolution of permeability, including deformation-induced changes in pores connectivity and dilatancy effect in a more complex time-dependent hydro-thermo-mechanical framework. However, our results demonstrate that the (de)compaction of the fault zone and associated fluid pressurization are the dominant mechanism controlling the occurrence of fault failure. Shear-induced dilatancy of fault gouge is a transient phenomenon during the initial stages of fault slip, and its effect is poorly constrained at great depth as it is only investigated experimentally at relatively low-pressure conditions (e.g., Brantut et al., 2018). Furthermore, laboratory measurements of pore-fluid pressure variations during fast slip in fault gouge samples seem to confirm that both mechanical compaction and fluid pressurization can overcome the initial phase of shear-induced dilatancy and thus induce fault failure (Aretusini et al., 2021). Future work will also focus on three-dimensional models (e.g., Jiang et al., 2022) and more realistic scenarios of geologic faults (e.g., Dal Zilio et al., 2018, 2019), which will allow to investigate the full spectrum of slip behavior observed in different tectonic settings (e.g., Jolivet and Frank, 2020; Behr and B\u00fcrgmann, 2021; Dal Zilio et al., 2021).\nWhile space geodesy has revolutionized our understanding of how tectonic faults accommodate earthquakes, slow-slip transients, and stable creep (e.g., B\u00fcrgmann, 2018), their short instrumental record makes it virtually impossible to understand the spatiotemporal interplay between different slip modes. Investigating whether pore-fluid diffusion affects variations in earthquake recurrence intervals, or fault tremor sequences with alternating longer and shorter repeat times (so-called period-doubling events) (Shelly, 2010), is a central question in earthquake physics. Also, systematic investigation of the visco-plastic bulk conditions that control slow-slip events (e.g., Viesca and Dublanchet, 2018; Lambert and Barbot, 2016; Gao and Wang, 2017; Wang and Barbot, 2020; Fagereng, Beall, 2021; Dal Zilio et al., 2022), rather than fault frictional properties (e.g., (Liu and Rice, 2007; Dal Zilio et al., 2020)), is an important frontier in earthquake source modeling. Further implementations can also account for temperature evolution, fault dilation, shear heating, thermal runaway (e.g., Braeck and Podladchikov, 2007), and the evolution of grain size (e.g., Austin and Evans, 2007), which can provide new insights into the onset of highly localized, fine-grained shear processes. Since shear heating can rapidly increase temperature (Viesca and Garagash, 2015), the associated weakening of shear strength may provide the conditions for episodic slow-slip transients, even under rate-strengthening fault behavior.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nWe have developed a finite difference method to account for fully coupled solid-fluid interaction over many earthquake cycles. The computational framework can model rate-strengthening plasticity in a poro-visco-elasto-plastic rheology. Numerical results are verified through convergence tests and comparisons with analytical benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point along a finite fault width. Future work will include a deeper exploration of parameter space, including the effects of permeability, rate-strengthening, and viscosity, as our set of parameters were chosen primarily for efficiency of computation. For the parameter study in this work, we found that pore-fluid pressure, porosity, and solid-fluid compressibility, influence the occurrence of seismic and aseismic slip.\nWe have investigated spontaneously occurring shear instabilities on a mildly rate-strengthening fault zone with solid-fluid coupling. Remarkably, these instabilities are fundamentally different from standard instabilities with rate-and-state friction in that they are controlled by localized (de)compaction of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone. Simulations show that these fluid-driven dynamic ruptures are controlled by solitary pulse-like pressure waves propagating at seismic speed. We have proposed a conceptual model for how this type of instability manifest in a 2-D plane strain shear model (mode-II). However, we recognize that in order to make a full comparison to geological settings we need to understand how the reported instabilities manifest in three dimensions. Despite this limitation, our work demonstrates how pore-fluid pressure, poroelastic effects, and inelastic deformation, can destabilize active faults and produce the full spectrum of slip, from fast- to slow-slip, consistent with observations.\nAlthough multiple weakening mechanisms may operate on active faults, our results suggest that self-pressurization of fluid-filled porous rocks may be the dominant contributor to fault fracture energy, particularly for large earthquakes. Understanding how faults lose their shear strength during fluid-induced dynamic rupture is critical, as it may help to constrain the minimum level of shear stress a fault requires to become unstable. In a broader context, this study shows the importance of incorporating the realistic hydro-mechanical structure of faults to investigate sequences of seismic and aseismic slip. In particular, this study indicates that pore-pressure evolution can completely change both the failure process on the interface and the long-term slip history of geologic faults.\n\n\nData availability statement\nData related to this paper are stored in the ETH-Bibliothek and can be downloaded from the following link: http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/20.500.11850\/532225 (doi: http:\/\/10.3929\/ethz-b-000532225)\n\n","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe 2018 MW 7.5 Palu, Indonesia, earthquake produced a devastating tsunami by a strike-slip earthquake (e.g., Muhari et al., 2018). The tsunami has relatively short periods (~100\u00a0s, Carvajal et al., 2019), which inundated only ~400\u00a0m inland, but the tsunami runup reached >10\u00a0m, causing over 1200 fatalities. The short periods of the tsunami can be understood by short-wavelength source(s) within the narrow Palu Bay (up to ~7\u00a0km wide), but the large runup is puzzling because a strike-slip earthquake is expected to produce predominantly horizontal and small vertical motion. Indisputably, this earthquake calls for a better understanding of the physics of tsunamigenesis and more accurate tsunami hazard assessments in strike-slip environments.\nThere is ongoing debate between the earthquake and submarine landslides as to the source(s) of the 2018 Palu tsunami. Eyewitnesses of sizable tsunamis from small-scale landslides near the coast (e.g., Carvajal et al., 2019) and presumption of a strike-slip earthquake incapable of producing large seafloor uplift led to models attributing the tsunami to submarine landslides (e.g., Nakata et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Several studies modeled the tsunami by the earthquake only (e.g., Heidarzadeh et al., 2018; Jamelot et al., 2019; Ulrich et al., 2019). In particular, Ulrich et al. (2019) concluded that ~2\u00a0m coseismic oblique slip on a 65\u00b0-dipping normal fault causing seafloor subsidence beneath Palu Bay is critical for the generation of the devastating tsunami. In contrast, Jamelot et al. (2019) modeled a major restraining bend under Palu Bay using elastic dislocation, which produced broad seafloor uplift well above 1\u00a0m between the fault and east shoreline. However, Nakata et al. (2020) pointed out that the broad subsidence and uplift in these two models are inconsistent with the observation at the tidal station, Pantoloan, where no considerable mean tidal level change due to the earthquake deformation was observed (Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020); the tidal record indicates a more localized source in Palu Bay. Many models attributed the tsunami to both the earthquake and landslides (e.g., Williamson et al., 2020; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020), with the major role of tsunami generation by submarine landslides in most of these models. Due to the availability of only one tidal record at Pantoloan (with a low sampling rate), though augmented by several sea-surface time histories extracted from recorded videos on social media (Carvajal et al., 2019), and somewhat poor understanding of fault geometry and location and submarine landslide sources (e.g., locations and volumes) there can be tradeoffs and non-uniqueness in these models; the source for the 2018 Palu tsunami is probably far from being well resolved.\nSeveral observations suggest that the 2018 Palu earthquake propagated with a supershear rupture velocity (e.g., Bao et al., 2019; Socquet et al., 2019). Mai (2019) hypothesized a possible connection between the supershear rupture and the devastating tsunami. Elbanna et al. (2021) investigated this hypothesis by numerically modeling a vertical strike-slip earthquake, coupled with the shallow water equation for tsunami in an idealized bay. Although supershear rupture on a planar strike-slip fault does not produce large permanent uplift they emphasized the importance of large seafloor velocity carried by supershear Mach fronts and excitation of tsunami by large horizontal velocity at seafloor slopes, claiming that dynamics of supershear rupture on a planar fault is important and can generate large tsunami (>1\u00a0m) in a narrow and shallow bay. However, the large sea surface height associated with supershear rupture in their model may not be tsunami because high-frequency nature of supershear seafloor motion (horizontal and vertical) can excite strong acoustic waves in real ocean and the large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by acoustic waves, which is ignored by the shallow water equation. Tsunami, however, is a gravitational wave with much longer period, insensitive to short-period excitations. Coupled models of earthquake and tsunami including ocean acoustic waves clearly showed the separation of these different types of waves and that tsunami is only sensitive to the final static deformation (e.g., Lotto and Dunham, 2015; Lotto et al., 2017, 2018; Saito et al., 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021; Krenz et al., 2021). Supershear rupture does not produce large tsunami, which will be demonstrated in this work.\n\nGusman et al. (2019) inverted the synthetic aperture radar displacement data and the tidal record at Pantoloan. They inferred that an uplift up to 0.8\u00a0m in the middle of Palu Bay was the major source of the tsunami and hypothesized that the compression at unmapped restraining bends or stepovers beneath Palu Bay may have contributed to the seafloor uplift. This hypothesis is similar to the coseismic pop-up hypothesis for tsunami generation by strike-slip earthquakes proposed by Legg et al. (2003).\nAnother hypothesis for the generation of Palu tsunami comes from Natawidjaja et al. (2020). They mapped a major releasing bend (~3.5\u00a0km wide) under Palu Bay and suggested that fault slip at this bend and several other major offshore faults north of Palu Bay as well as triggered submarine landslides may have generated the devastating tsunami. One inconsistency with this hypothesis is that the releasing bend would produce subsidence instead of uplift. Also, mechanically releasing bends tend to slow down or stop the rupture due to the strengthening effect of pore fluids (e.g., Sibson, 1986; Hirakawa and Ma, 2018). The Palu earthquake indeed stopped shortly after passing a\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0km wide releasing bend in the south. Moreover, the hypocenter in this model is offshore, which is different from many other models for the Palu earthquake (e.g., Socquet et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2019).\nIt is important to realize that restraining and releasing bends are prevalently coexistent due to local fault strike variations, resulting in rapid variations of local stress field in a region (e.g., Legg et al., 2007). Socquet et al. (2019) resolved local transpression under Palu Bay and north of 0.7\u00b0S in Sulawesi Neck although the Palu region is overall under transtension (e.g., Socquet et al., 2006). For the Palu earthquake rupture to propagate from Sulawesi Neck northeast of the bay to southwest local transpression at fault bends or stepovers beneath the bay can be envisioned in a left-lateral strike-slip environment (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019; Gusman et al., 2019; Williamson et al., 2020; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020).\nOther than the 2018 Palu earthquake, the 1994 MW 7.1 Mindoro Island, Philippines, earthquake is another example of a strike-slip earthquake producing a large tsunami (e.g., Imamura et al., 1995). In this work, I do not model a particular event, but present a mechanism for efficient tsunami generation in a strike-slip setting involving restraining bends, in support of the pop-up hypothesis of Legg et al. (2003) and Gusman et al. (2019) mentioned above. This mechanism is generic and aimed for tsunamigenesis by strike-slip earthquakes with fault complexities worldwide, including possibly at Palu Bay.\nNearly all the earthquake models with fault bends for the Palu earthquake (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019; Sep\u00falveda et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) and other strike-slip earthquakes (e.g., Geist and Zoback, 2002; Borrero et al., 2004) to explain tsunamigenesis used elastic dislocation theory (e.g., Okada, 1985). However, elastic dislocation models do not produce efficient seafloor uplift at fault bends or stepovers. Here I will show that dynamic off-fault failure (inelastic deformation) at restraining bends is an important tsunami source in a strike-slip earthquake, which has been largely unrecognized although coseismic pop-up structures are widely observed (e.g., Hamling et al., 2017). By modeling 3D dynamic rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault with undrained inelastic off-fault response inelastic deformation at restraining bends will be shown below to produce significantly larger and more localized surface uplift than a purely elastic dislocation model, due to frictional sliding with a thrust component on conjugate microfractures produced by dynamic failure. The inelastic zone along with the produced surface uplift result in a positive flower and pop-up structure, which generates localized tsunami efficiently in shallow water, in contrast to the broad uplift in the elastic dislocation model with fault bends (e.g., Jamelot et al., 2019). This mechanism is similar to the one applied in inelastic wedge deformation models for tsunamigenesis in subduction zones (e.g., Ma, 2012; Ma and Hirakawa, 2013; Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021).\nEffects of fault bends on rupture dynamics have been widely investigated by modeling simple bends (e.g., Kase and Day, 2006; Oglesby et al., 2008; Duan and Day, 2008; Lozos et al., 2011) or faults with fractal roughness (e.g., Dunham et al., 2011; Shi and Day, 2013) with or without off-fault plasticity. Most models showed acute sensitivities of rupture velocity with restraining and releasing bends under certain uniform regional stress fields, shedding important insights on the physics of earthquake rupture and generation of high-frequency ground motion. The aforementioned models, however, did not study the effects of inelastic deformation at fault bends on surface deformation, which is the focus of this work.\nIn the following, I will first show dynamic rupture models on vertical strike-slip faults without ocean to demonstrate the efficient surface uplift produced by inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends. Fully-coupled models of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami (e.g., Lotto and Dunham, 2015; Lotto et al., 2017, 2018; Wilson and Ma, 2021; Krenz et al., 2021) are then presented to show the large tsunami produced by this mechanism in a shallow bay.\n\n\n2\nDynamic rupture models without ocean\nI consider dynamic rupture on a vertical left-lateral strike-slip fault with a major restraining bend (Fig. 1\n). The coordinate system shown is used throughout in this paper. The bend geometry is specified by \nx\n=\n\nW\n2\n\ncos\n\n\n\n\u03c0\nL\n\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\nL\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n, where W and L are the width and length of the bend, with the bend center at surface located at the origin. The bend angle varies smoothly in space, from 0 at the two boundaries with the planar fault sections to the maximum at the center, denoted by \u03b8. The bend length can be shown to relate to \u03b8 by \nL\n=\n\n\u03c0W\n\n2\ntan\u03b8\n\n\n. The bend width is fixed in this work: W\u00a0=\u00a03.5 km. Two bend angles are considered: \u03b8=30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, for which the bend length is L\u00a0=\u00a09.5224 km and 5.4978 km, respectively. Results below will focus on the geometry with \u03b8=30\u00b0 unless otherwise noted. These models are generic and can be easily extended to other bend geometries.\nThe fault is embedded in a homogeneous half space (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a02670 kg\/m3, V\n\nP\n\u00a0=\u00a06000 m\/s, and V\n\nS\n\u00a0=\u00a03464 m\/s, where \u03c1, V\n\nP\n, and V\n\nS\n are density and P- and S-wave speeds, respectively). The fault is 15\u00a0km wide and reaches the free surface. The fault length along y-axis is 60\u00a0km. The hypocenter is located at y\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0km and z\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210\u00a0km.\nI assume a uniform regional stress field. The vertical principal stress is lithostatic stress minus hydrostatic pore pressure, i.e., \u03c3\n\nV\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3\n\nzz\n\u00a0=\u00a0(\u03c1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03c1\n\nw\n)gz, where \u03c1\n\nw\n is water density and g is gravitational acceleration (9.8\u00a0m\/s2). The continuum mechanics convention is used, i.e., compressive stress is negative. All the normal stresses are effective stresses in this paper. The maximum horizontal compressive stress \u03c3\n\nHmax\n makes an angle (\u03c8) with respect to y-axis (Fig. 1a). To specify the two horizontal principal stresses: \u03c3\n\nHmax\n and \u03c3\n\nHmin\n (the minimum horizontal compressive stress), a critical stress solution is derived in the Appendix, based on the Drucker-Prager yield criterion (Drucker and Prager, 1952)\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ns\nij\n\n\ns\nij\n\n\n\n\u2264\nc\n\ncos\u03d5\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\nkk\n\u2217\n\n3\n\nsin\u03d5\n\n\nwhere s\n\nij\n is the deviatoric stress tensor, an asterisk denotes effective stress, c is cohesion, and \u03d5 is internal friction angle. The simple derivation in the Appendix is similar to Dahlen's (1984) solution for a critical cohesionless accretionary wedge. The critical stress concept was also proposed for the continental crust (e.g., Zoback and Townend, 2001). Here the use of critical stress state is motivated by the intense internal deformation within restraining bends during interseismic period that may drive the material to the verge of failure. This is only one simple way to set up the initial stress conditions, to investigate the effect of inelastic off-fault deformation. We will see that it is the local stress field around the bend that plays an important role in surface deformation. The critical stress solution outside the bend is not important because most inelastic deformation occurs around the bend.\nThe critical stress solution requires internal friction angle \u03d5 and the initial frictional coefficient on the fault \n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c3\nN\n\n\n, where \u03c4 and \u03c3\n\nN\n are initial shear and normal stresses on the fault. I assume tan\u03d5\u00a0=\u00a00.75 and \u03bc\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.4 (on the planar sections of the fault), which are identical to the parameters in Ma (2008) and Ma and Andrews (2010).\nIn a transpressive stress regime, the maximum compressive stress is \u03c3\n\nHmax\n. However, the minimum compressive stress does not have to be \u03c3\n\nHmin\n, but can instead be \u03c3\n\nV\n due to enhanced horizontal compression, similar to a thrust setting. I choose \u03c8 to be <30\u00b0. For large angle \u03c8 restraining bends easily stop the rupture. The small \u03c8 mimics transpressive environments due to oblique plate convergence and possibly strike-slip faults with well-developed damage zones (e.g., Faulkner et al., 2006). Two cases are considered in this work: \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0. For \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 the critical stress solution gives \u03c3\n\nHmin\n\u00a0=\u00a01.1112\u03c3\n\nV\n and \u03c3\n\nHmax\n\u00a0=\u00a02.7298\u03c3\n\nV\n, thus the minimum compressive stress is vertical. For a slightly different angle \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0, the critical stress solution gives \u03c3\n\nHmin\n\u00a0=\u00a00.8599\u03c3\n\nV\n and \u03c3\n\nHmax\n\u00a0=\u00a02.4010\u03c3\n\nV\n, i.e., the minimum compressive stress becomes horizontal, which is a strike-slip state. Again, these stress conditions are most appropriate locally around the transpressional bend; outside the bend these stresses may be less applicable but unimportant due to small induced inelastic off-fault deformation. All three principal stresses are linearly depth-dependent. The details of these solutions are given in the Appendix. We will see below that these different orientations of principal stresses can play an important role in the effect of inelastic deformation on surface uplift around the bend.\nThe stress field in the domain is completely determined by the three principal stresses specified above. The shear and normal stresses on fault can be obtained by rotating the two horizontal principal stresses. Fig. 2\n shows these stresses for \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03b8=30\u00b0, which is the main model to be discussed below. Both the shear and normal stresses increase within the bend due to more optimal orientations of the bend with respect to \u03c3\n\nHmax\n (Fig. 2c). The most optimal orientation of the fault is shown by the tangent line in Fig. A1. Within the bend the fault rotates smoothly from the bend boundary to a more optimal angle with respect to \u03c3\n\nHmax\n initially, and the angle becomes less optimal at the center of the bend and then more optimal again on the other side of the bend. The initial friction coefficient therefore has two symmetric peaks and a central trough within the bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). This variation is due to the smooth cosine geometry profile used. The more optimal orientations of the fault bend will be shown below to easily lead to supershear rupture. If a straight fault bend is used the more optimal orientation of the bend also leads to a larger ratio of resolved shear to normal stresses, but large strain localizations can occur at sharp bend boundaries (e.g., Duan and Day, 2008).\nI use a time-weakening friction law on the fault to model dynamic rupture propagation (Andrews, 2004). The friction law is similar to a slip-weakening friction law, but with variable critical slip-weakening distances to well resolve stress breakdown at rupture front. The stress breakdown is as abrupt as possible in a given numerical scheme. I assume a constant static frictional coefficient \u03bc\n\ns\n\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and dynamic frictional coefficient \u03bc\n\nd\n\u00a0=\u00a00.3, same as in Ma (2008) and Ma and Andrews (2010). At the rupture front stress drops linearly from static friction to dynamic friction over a time interval t\n\nc\n = 0.08\u00a0s, an interval for S-wave to travel ~2.8 elements (element size is described below). The S ratio, defined by the ratio of strength excess to dynamic stress drop (e.g., Andrews, 1976), equivalent to \nS\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bc\nd\n\n\n\n, is 2 on the planar fault sections to avoid supershear rupture. However, within the bend the S ratio is smaller due to the increase of \u03bc\n0 from the more optimal orientation of fault bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). To avoid abrupt rupture stopping at fault bottom and lateral boundaries I smoothly increase \u03bc\n\nd\n to \u03bc\n\ns\n to induce negative stress drops (Fig. 2b, d). Near the free surface, I also increase \u03bc\n\nd\n to \u03bc\n\ns\n smoothly between ~2\u20134\u00a0km depth (Fig. 2b) to mimic the shallow velocity-strengthening behavior of fault zone materials (e.g., Scholz, 1998). The rupture is nucleated by forcing a rupture velocity of 2000\u00a0m\/s from the hypocenter with stress drop from initial friction to dynamic friction over 10 timesteps, and it then propagates spontaneously shortly afterwards with a faster velocity.\nThe Drucker-Prager yield criterion (eq. 1) is used to model inelastic deformation off the fault. The pressure dependence of yield strength in this criterion promotes inelastic failure at shallow depths due to low confining pressure, forming a \u2018flower-like\u2019 damage zone (e.g., Ma, 2008; Ma and Andrews, 2010). In this work, this yield criterion will be shown to give rise to positive flower structures at restraining bends, which are widely observed in transpressive fault zones.\nThe critical stress solution assumes cohesionless material. In the dynamic rupture models, I add cohesion to move the initial stress away from a critical state while keeping the stresses unchanged. An initial closeness-to-failure (CF) parameter is defined\n\n(2)\n\nCF\n=\n\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\ns\nij\n0\n\n\ns\nij\n0\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\nc\n\ncos\u03d5\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c3\nkk\n\n\u2217\n,\n0\n\n\n3\n\nsin\u03d5\n\n\n\n\nwhere the superscript 0 denotes initial stress, which is between 0 and 1. I specify the CF in the model, which determines the cohesion according to eq. 2 as all the stresses and internal frictional angle are obtained previously. For simplicity, CF is only a function of y (i.e., invariant with x) because inelastic off-fault deformation occurs mostly near the fault. The CF is assumed to be larger (i.e., closer to failure) for material within the bend due to more intense internal deformation expected over geological time. The CF outside the bend (CF\n\nplane\n) is fixed to be 0.7 in all inelastic cases. Different CFs within the bend (CF\n\nbend\n) are chosen from 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, to 0.95 to investigate how inelastic deformation affects surface uplift. A smooth transition from CF\n\nbend\n to CF\n\nplane\n is specified over a distance of 5\u00a0km outside both sides of the bend. In the elastic case both CF\n\nbend\n and CF\n\nplane\n are 0, implying infinite cohesion so inelastic deformation does not occur.\nThe undrained material response is incorporated in the model, which can significantly affect inelastic off-fault deformation (e.g., Viesca et al., 2008). I assume Skemption's coefficient B\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and Biot's coefficient \u03b1=0.5. Yielding is allowed in shear only, assuming no inelastic dilatancy or compaction (e.g., Andrews, 2005). When yielding occurs each deviatoric stress component is reduced by a common factor to meet the yield criterion (e.g., Andrews, 2005; Ma and Andrews, 2010). The stress adjustments represent the volume density of seismic moment tensor off the fault, mimicking frictional sliding on microfractures. The model is very similar to the 3D subduction zone model of Ma and Nie (2019).\nA finite-element code is used for dynamic rupture modeling, which has been extensively tested in the Southern California Earthquake Center Code Verification Exercises (e.g., Harris et al., 2018). The finite-element mesh consists of 4-node tetrahedral elements only. The fault is discretized by element size ~100\u00a0m. The mesh coarsens gradually to a remote boundary such that wave reflections from the boundary do not contaminate the solution. Each model is run for 50\u00a0s with a time step of 0.004\u00a0s to ensure that the domain of interest reaches final static equilibrium.\nAs a reference point for interpretating the inelastic models, I show the snapshots of slip velocity and shear stress change on fault and vertical surface velocity for a simulation with elastic off-fault response for the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 (Fig. 3\n). The rupture propagates spontaneously shortly after the nucleation. Because the dynamic stress drop increases linearly with depth the slip velocity also increases with depth. The rupture stops smoothly at bottom and lateral boundaries due to the specified negative stress drops, and propagates predominantly along negative y direction with a subshear rupture velocity. Despite the negative stress drop specified at shallow depths the rupture reaches the free surface and a small reflected phase by the free surface can be seen after the rupture front. When the rupture enters the bend a supershear rupture front is clearly developed, which results from the higher initial frictional coefficient due to the overall more optimal orientation of the bend (Figs. 1b and 2d). A shear Mach front can be clearly seen on the vertical ground velocity. A pronounced fault region with large shear stress increase near the surface edge of the bend is seen, due to large dynamic compression at the bend and the increase of dynamic friction specified at shallow depths (Fig. 1b). We will see in the subsequent inelastic simulations that the large shear stress increase in this region promotes off-fault failure. A larger stress stop is seen below this feature due to the overall larger \u03bc\n0 and initial normal stresses within the bend (Figs. 2c, d), which leads to larger slip (see Fig. 4a).\nThe slip distribution and rupture time contours every 1\u00a0s on the fault for this elastic simulation are illustrated in Fig. 4a. The subshear rupture before and supershear rupture after entering the bend can be clearly seen in the rupture time contours. The rupture time contours indicate that the rupture goes supershear near the surface. This is due to small normal stress and static friction at shallow depths, which is a minor feature. Due to negative stress drops shallow supershear rupture barely affects the rupture at depth. The slip distribution and rupture time contours in the case of a planar fault (without the bend) are shown in Fig. S1a. Only subshear rupture is seen along the entire fault at depth.\nThe surface displacements with and without bend in the elastic case are shown in Figs. 5a and S2a. The peak surface uplift is 0.59\u00a0m and 0.38\u00a0m with and without bend, respectively. In the planar fault case, the peak surface uplift is on the compressional side and near the boundary of the fault. The small uplift for the planar fault is consistent with the notion that vertical strike-slip earthquakes produce predominantly horizontal but small vertical motion. In the nonplanar case, the peak uplift is within the bend due to increased compression, as expected. However, when the material response is elastic the increase of uplift is still limited. This model is similar to most elastic dislocation models for tsunamigenesis by strike-slip earthquakes mentioned earlier.\nAs the CF in the bend increases, the slip remains largely unchanged over most of the fault except for near the surface edge of the bend where the slip diminishes (Fig. 4), which is due to more deformation occurring off the fault inelastically (e.g., Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021). This is the same region with a large shear stress increase on the fault (Fig. 3). The increase of shear stress due to large dynamic compression and increase of dynamic friction coefficient, along with dynamic pore pressure increase at the bend, promote off-fault failure. As a result, surface uplift increases significantly with CF\n\nbend\n, resulting in a localized pop-up structure (Figs. 5 and 6\n). The peak surface uplift increases from 0.66\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.7), 0.89\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.8), 1.19\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.9), to 1.34\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). The ratio of peak uplifts between CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95 and CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.0 (elastic case) reaches 2.27. Fig. 7\n shows the fault-parallel and vertical surface displacements at a cross section through the center of the fault bend. The increase of surface uplift (both peak amplitude and volume) and decrease of relative displacements across the fault due to inelastic deformation are more clearly seen.\nThe higher efficiency of producing uplift by inelastic deformation can also be clearly seen even along a planar fault (Fig. S2). Located near the boundary of the fault the peak uplift increases from 0.38\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.0) to 0.60\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.95), an increase of 57.89%. The peak uplift for each CF is seen on the compressional side of the fault because the inelastic deformation occurs on the compressional side of the fault when the angle \u03c8 is small (e.g., Viesca et al., 2008). The large inelastic uplift in this planar fault case is less localized than the fault bend case, as expected.\nThe physics for the increase of uplift with CF is same as in the inelastic wedge deformation models in subduction zones (e.g., Ma, 2012; Ma and Hirakawa, 2013; Ma and Nie, 2019; Wilson and Ma, 2021). The higher efficiency of producing uplift by inelastic deformation is due to frictional sliding on conjugate microfractures with a thrust component modeled by plastic flow. In the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0, the minimum compressive stress is vertical. If S\n1, S\n2, and S\n3 are three principal deviatoric stresses in an ascending order, we have |S\n2|\u00a0<\u00a0\u00a0min\u00a0(|S\n1|,|S\n3|) due to S\n1\u00a0+\u00a0S\n2\u00a0+\u00a0S\n3\u00a0=\u00a00. During plastic yielding modeled by the Drucker-Prager yield criterion, because each deviatoric stress is adjusted by a common factor the minimum adjustment among three of them is always in S\n2. Therefore, the stress adjustments in S\n3 are always larger than S\n2, which is volume density of the moment tensor component m\n\nzz\n that produces the inelastic uplift. In the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0, the minimum compressive stress is horizontal. The direction of S\n2 is vertical, therefore inelastic deformation (plastic flow) produces small uplift, but more horizontal motion.\nA pronounced flower structure can be seen for CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95 (Fig. 8\n). The inelastic zone widens significantly as the free surface is approached, which is due to lower confining pressure and yield strength near the surface (e.g., Ma, 2008; Ma and Andrews, 2010). The inelastic zone is mostly localized within the restraining bend because of the larger CF within the bend as well as large dynamic stress concentrations and pore pressure increase produced by rupture propagation. Along with the inelastic surface uplift the inelastic zone forms a distinct positive flower structure. A much smaller inelastic zone is seen outside the bend due to a lower CF.\nWhen the bend geometry changes to \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, the fault bend is severely misoriented with the maximum compressive stress such that the initial fault friction within the bend is lower than dynamic friction (Fig. S3). The rupture stops naturally within the bend in each CF case (Fig. S4). However, dynamic compression within the bend still produces significant inelastic uplift (Figs. S5 and S6). The peak uplift increases 77.42% from 0.31\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.55\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). A smaller positive flower structure is seen (Fig. S7).\nWhen the orientation of the maximum compressive stress changes to \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0 the stress state is a strike-slip type with a horizontal minimum compressive stress. The restraining bend is more optimally oriented with respect to the regional stress field than for \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. For \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, there are two larger peaks of initial friction coefficient within the bend (Fig. S8), which leads to supershear rupture more easily after the rupture enters the bend and larger stress drop and slip within the bend than in the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 (Fig. S9). For a planar fault, except at shallow depths the rupture remains subshear on the fault (Fig. S10), as in the \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 case. However, as the CF increases the peak uplift does not increase as efficiently as in the \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0 case. In the case of a planar fault (without bend) the peak uplift changes from 0.28\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.37\u00a0m (CF =\u00a00.95) with an increase of only 28.37% (Fig. S11). With the restraining bend the peak uplift changes from 0.73\u00a0m (elastic case) to 1.03\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95) increasing only 41.10% (Figs. S12\u201314), much smaller than in the case of \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. This is largely due to the direction of the minimum compressive stress being horizontal, as discussed earlier. Inelastic off-fault deformation and plastic flow generate more horizontal motion, resulting in broader but smaller uplift. A similar positive flower structure can be seen in Fig. S15.\nThe smaller \u03c8 also allows the rupture to pass through larger restraining bends. For \u03b8 = 45\u00b0, the initial friction at the center of the bend is no longer smaller than dynamic friction (Fig. S16). The rupture jumps to supershear within the bend, again due to more optimal orientation of the bend. A clear reduction of fault slip near the surface edge of the bend is also seen due to inelastic off-fault deformation (Fig. S17). Although inelastic deformation promotes more horizontal displacement the large bend angle and small bend length creates a space problem in this case, causing efficient generation of local uplift (Figs. S18\u201320). The peak uplift increases from 0.45\u00a0m (elastic case) to 0.90\u00a0m (CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95), a factor of 2 increase. A similar positive flower structure is shown in Fig. S21.\n\n\n3\nFully-coupled models of dynamic rupture and tsunami with a shallow bay\nHaving demonstrated the efficiency of generating uplift by inelastic deformation at restraining bends, it remains to show that this mechanism is relevant in tsunami generation. To this aim, I add a narrow and shallow bay (Fig. 9\n) in the model and consider the full coupling of dynamic rupture in the solid Earth and ocean acoustic waves and tsunami in the bay.\nThe geometry of the bay is idealized and similar to the one used in Elbanna et al. (2021), and is given by\n\n(3)\n\nz\n=\n\u2212\nh\n\nx\ny\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n+\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\ntanh\n\n\n\nx\n\n\u2212\nw\n\nc\n\n,\n\n\u2212\n5\n\u2264\ny\n\u2264\n50\n\nkm\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n+\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\nh\n0\n\n\u2212\n\nh\n1\n\n\n2\n\ntanh\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n2\n\n+\n\n\n\ny\n+\n5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2212\nw\n\nc\n\n,\n\ny\n<\n\u2212\n5\n\nkm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere h(x,\ny) is depth of the bay (positive downward) and the maximum and minimum depth of the bay is h\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.7 km and h\n1\u00a0=\u00a00.05 km, respectively, and two parameters defining the transition from h\n0 to h\n1 are w= 3\u00a0km and c= 0.4\u00a0km. There is a semi-circular apex region at y\u00a0<\u00a0\u22125\u00a0km with a radius of 5\u00a0km delimiting the bay. The bay is 10\u00a0km wide north of the apex region and extends to y\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0km. A small linear taper of 15\u00b0 dipping from the edge of the bay is used to decrease the bay depth to 0 at the coastline (Fig. 9b); the width of the taper can be shown to be \n\n\nh\n1\n\n\ntan\n\n15\n\u00b0\n\n\n\n.\nFour fully-coupled models are considered: (I) a subshear rupture on a planar fault with elastic off-fault response, (II) a supershear rupture on a planar fault with elastic off-fault response, (III) rupture on a fault with a restraining bend (\u03b8 = 30\u00b0) and elastic off-fault response, and (IV) rupture on a fault with a restraining bend (\u03b8 = 30\u00b0) and inelastic off-fault response (CF\n\nplane\n\u00a0=\u00a00.7 and CF\n\nbend\n\u00a0=\u00a00.95). The material properties of the solid, fault geometry, hypocenter location, and frictional parameters are same as those in the previous section except that top part of the volume is cut away by the bay. The density and P-wave speed of the ocean are 1000\u00a0kg\/m3 and 1500\u00a0m\/s, respectively. The S-wave speed vanishes in the ocean.\nThe maximum compressive stress direction in all four models is fixed at \u03c8\u00a0=\u00a020\u00b0. Thus, Models I, III, and IV are same as the models shown in Figs. S1a, 4a and 4e, respectively, except for the presence of the bay. Model II was not considered previously. This model is identical to model I except that the static frictional coefficient on the fault is changed to \u03bc\n\ns\n = 0.45, which gives rise to a S ratio of 0.5 leading to supershear rupture over the entire fault. All other parameters, including dynamic stress drops, between these two models are identical. For simplicity, the initial stresses in the solid domain are calculated in the same way as in the previous section, i.e., the presence of the shallow bay in specifying these stresses is ignored.\nThe coupling between the solid and ocean is done by enforcing the continuity of normal displacement and normal traction and vanishing shear traction at the seafloor, i.e., the tangential displacement is discontinuous. The gravity waves are simulated by using a linearized sea surface boundary condition derived by Lotto and Dunham (2015), which is validated by a semi-analytical solution in Wilson and Ma (2021). The models are very similar to the fully-coupled models of Wilson and Ma (2021), except that the models presented here are in 3D. To generate finite-element meshes I discretize the fault and seafloor by an element size ~100\u00a0m and the ocean by ~25\u00a0m for all four models. Only 4-node tetrahedral elements are used. Each model is run for 100\u00a0s with a time step 0.004\u00a0s.\nIn the fully-coupled models the fault nodes at the seafloor are not allowed to slip, which removes the discontinuity in seafloor deformation at the fault trace. This causes only small differences on seafloor deformation compared to the previous results without ocean due to the specified negative stress drops at shallow depths. If the fault nodes at seafloor are indeed allowed to slip a triple junction arises at each point because tangential displacement at the seafloor is also discontinuous, which unnecessarily complicates the model. Sharp displacement discontinuities at seafloor do not produce tsunami as any wavelengths shorter than ocean depth are removed by the nonhydrostatic response of the ocean (Kajiura, 1963).\nThe slip distributions and rupture time contours for the four models are shown in Fig. 10\n. The snapshots of 3-component ground displacement at 5, 10, 15, and 100\u00a0s for the four models are illustrated in Fig. S22\u201324. The Mach front of model II due to supershear rupture is clearly seen. The rupture speed of model I stays subshear (Figs. S22\u201324 and 10a). Despite different rupture speeds the surface displacement at 100\u00a0s and slip distributions between models I and II are nearly identical because the dynamic stress drops in these two models are the same. These results are nearly identical to the model without ocean (Figs. S1a and S2a). The same applies to models III and IV, which are nearly identical to the models shown in Figs. 4 \u2013 6. The presence of the bay only affects slip distribution and surface deformation slightly due to the shallowness of the bay. Broad elastic surface uplift in model III and more localized and larger inelastic surface uplift in model IV are produced after the rupture passes through the restraining bend. The large inelastic uplift in model IV is associated with diminishing shallow slip on the fault (Fig. 10d), as shown previously. In these fully-coupled results, due to the presence of the ocean (with wave reverberations within the narrow bay and slowly propagating tsunami) the seafloor deformation still fluctuates slightly at 100\u00a0s (long after the rupture stops). To simplify the discussion, I will treat the ground surface displacements at 100\u00a0s as final static displacements below.\nThe three components of permanent seafloor deformation are detailed in Fig. 11\n. The similarities between models I and II and differences between models III and IV discussed above can be more clearly seen. The peak static uplift in the four models is 0.25, 0. 27, 0.50, and 1.42\u00a0m, respectively (Fig. 11c). Also shown in Fig. 11d is the seafloor uplift by including the contribution of horizontal displacement of seafloor slope (Tanioka and Satake, 1996), which is given by\n\n(4)\n\n\nu\n\nt\ns\n\n\n=\n\nu\nz\n\n+\n\nu\nx\n\n\n\n\u2202\nh\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\nu\ny\n\n\n\n\u2202\nh\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\nwhere u\n\nx\n, u\n\ny\n, and u\n\nz\n is permanent seafloor displacement along x, y, and z, respectively. The width of the seafloor uplift contributed by the horizontal displacement (Figs. 11a, b) is directly related to the width of seafloor slope shown in Fig. 9, which is ~1.2\u00a0km. There is no contribution in the center of the bay because the bay bottom is flat. The physics underlying the contribution of horizontal displacement in tsunamigenesis is simply due to the continuity of normal displacement at the seafloor. If the seafloor slope moves towards the ocean, it contributes to uplift of the ocean; it lowers the ocean when the seafloor slope moves away from the ocean. The blue and red patterns around the edge of the bay (directly above the seafloor slope) can be understood by relating to the two horizontal displacements shown in Figs. 11a and b. Notably, the horizontal displacement contribution is largest near the edge of the apex region due to the large strike-slip motion in all four models. The peak uplift by including the contribution of horizontal displacement reaches 0.93, 1.09, 1.42, and 1.94\u00a0m, respectively, all at the apex edge (Fig. 11d). Clearly, the seafloor uplift due to horizontal displacement of seafloor slope is the dominant feature in models I and II, which has much shorter wavelength than the uplift around the bend in models III and IV. We will see below that tsunami in the fully-coupled models are closely related to the seafloor uplift pattern shown in Fig. 11d.\nThe snapshots of sea surface height for the four models are shown in Fig. 12\n, illustrating the evolutions of ocean acoustic waves and tsunami in the narrow-shallow bay. More details can be seen in Movie S1 in the Supplementary Materials. A 4th-order Butterworth lowpass filter with cutoff wavelength of 1\u00a0km is applied (to ensure 10 elements per wavelength) because a relatively coarse mesh resolution (~100\u00a0m) is used at the seafloor. Clear ocean acoustic waves are produced by the propagation of rupture on the fault and these waves reverberate within the bay for a long time. The rupture front passes the apex region of the bay within about 10\u00a0s in all four models (Fig. 10). Stronger ocean acoustic waves from model II can be seen at 5\u00a0s, which are associated with large S-wave radiation of the Mach front (Figs. S22\u201324). However, after the rupture propagates out of the bay the wave amplitude differences between models I and II are nearly indistinguishable. The horizontal displacements of sloping seafloor generate most of the tsunami in these two models, slowly propagating into the bay from left and right edges (barely seen in this figure), and most notably from the apex region of the bay. However, the tsunami in the apex region quickly attenuates due to geometric spreading. The tsunami is well correlated with the static seafloor uplift pattern shown in Fig. 11d. The amplitude of the tsunami in both models appear very small (~ 0.1\u00a0m), which is due to the small permanent uplift caused by strike-slip motion and relatively small contributions from the horizontal displacement in the models. Supershear rupture does not appear to produce larger tsunami than subshear rupture in these fully-coupled models.\nModels III and IV show significantly different results. Large tsunami results from the uplift in the middle of the bay after the rupture passes through the restraining bend. The sea surface height at 15\u00a0s closely matches the seafloor uplift amplitude in Fig. 11d. The splitting of the tsunami around the bend and propagation away from the bend can be clearly seen after ~15\u00a0s. The tsunami propagates approximately perpendicular to the fault bend affected slightly by the bathymetry, causing large impact on the left and right shorelines; much weaker propagation is seen parallel to the fault. A large tsunami is also seen generated from the apex edge of the bay, due to a larger horizontal displacement in these two models resulting from larger stress drop within the bend (Fig. 11d). Interestingly, in the apex region to the right of the fault sea surface first drops due to broad seafloor subsidence (Fig. 11c) and then rises due to the inward motion of the sloping seafloor. The tsunami interferes constructively with the downward-propagating tsunami produced by the bend uplift, causing large tsunami amplitude in the apex region and surrounding coast. This constructive interference is not seen in models I and II. The amplitude of the tsunami correlates very well with the amplitude of static seafloor deformation shown in Fig. 11d. The tsunami in model IV appears more localized and has more than twice the amplitude than the tsunami in model III, confirming the efficiency of tsunamigenesis by inelastic off-fault deformation at the restraining bend.\nThe space-time plots of sea surface height at four horizontal cross sections (y\u00a0=\u00a020, 10, 0, \u22125\u00a0km) are illustrated in Figs. 13 \u2013 16\n\n\n\n. Clearer reverberations of ocean acoustic waves and different tsunami amplitudes and speeds can be seen more clearly. Static seafloor uplift with and without the contribution from horizontal displacement at each cross section is also shown.\nIn models I and II, due to the symmetry of the model seafloor deformation and sea surface height are antisymmetric with respect to the fault trace (x\u00a0=\u00a00). In all the cross sections, clear seaward tsunamis are generated by the horizontal displacement of seafloor slope, which have short wavelengths related to the width of the seafloor slope (~1.2\u00a0km). The tsunami speed is less than, but very close to the shallow-water limit \n\n\ng\n\nh\n0\n\n\n\n due to dispersion of short-wavelength tsunami (the dispersive signals are not well resolved in the model here due to relatively coarser mesh resolution at the seafloor). The landward tsunami produced by the horizontal displacement of sloping seafloor can also be seen, with a slower speed due to decreasing bay depth. The broad seafloor uplift and subsidence on two sides of the fault due to the earthquake generate broad sea surface rise and drop, which are essentially long-wavelength tsunami traversing across the bay; these long-wavelength tsunamis cancel each other perfectly at x\u00a0=\u00a00. The tsunami is seen propagating away from the fault due to the vertical seafloor change across the fault, which are the wavefronts of these long-wavelength tsunamis (Figs. 14 \u2013 16). These different tsunamis are superimposed (linearly) in the bay together with ocean acoustic waves, resulting a complex pattern. Nonetheless, the tsunamis in models I and II appear very similar and small.\nThe presence of fault bend breaks the symmetry in models III and IV. Distinct short-wavelength tsunamis from horizontal seafloor displacement and broad sea surface drop and rise due to seafloor subsidence and uplift can also be clearly seen. At y\u00a0=\u00a00, the tsunami produced by the uplift at the restraining bend is clearly illustrated (Fig. 15). The tsunami amplitude above the bend is well above 1\u00a0m in model IV, more than twice as large as in model III. The tsunami propagates away from the central uplift region with decreasing speed and increasing amplitude, due to the decreasing ocean depth towards the shoreline. The tsunami amplitude near the shoreline reaches ~0.3\u00a0m in model III and\u00a0~\u00a00.8\u00a0m in model IV. Nonlinearity, sea bottom friction, and runup are not included in the simulations here, so the actual tsunami heights in a real shallow bay will be much larger. The shorter-wavelength inelastic uplift produces more localized tsunami in model IV than the elastic uplift in model III. The tsunami amplitude correlates very well with the static seafloor uplift. Fig. 16 shows the cross section at y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22125\u00a0km, displaying more of the interferences in the apex region between the tsunamis produced at the fault bend and the apex edge of the bay.\n\nFig. 17\n shows the sea surface height time histories at cross section y\u00a0=\u00a00. Larger tsunamis in models III and IV and small tsunami in models I and II are evident. Clear ocean acoustic waves are also seen, with much shorter periods than the tsunami. Note the faster arrival and larger amplitude of ocean acoustic waves due to supershear rupture in model II. However, the wave amplitudes are very similar after 10\u00a0s between models I and II. Similar patterns can be seen in time histories at the other three cross sections (Figs. S25\u201327).\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nRestraining bends are well recognized in causing orogeny worldwide. Laboratory experiments also clearly showed uplift caused by inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends under slow loading (e.g., Cooke et al., 2013). Coseismic pop-up structures of various scales are widely observed (e.g., Hamling et al., 2017; Hananto et al., 2020), which are possible manifestations of inelastic off-fault deformation (e.g., Diederichs et al., 2019). Legg et al. (2003) recognized the importance of pop-up structures at restraining bends and stepovers in tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip setting, but later modeling work only considered elastic deformation (e.g., Borrero et al., 2004). The work here has shown that dynamic stresses caused by the earthquake rupture front induce coseismic off-fault failure at restraining bends, which results in more efficient and localized uplift than elastic dislocation models. The higher efficiency is due to frictional sliding on conjugate microfractures with a thrust component, which is the same physics causing orogeny. With significant inelastic off-fault deformation the slip at shallow depths is diminished. This can be an important mechanism for tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip environment, which supports the pop-up hypothesis of Legg et al. (2003) and Gusman et al. (2019).\nThis mechanism produces short-wavelength inelastic uplift, largely controlled by bend size, which can contribute significantly to tsunamigenesis in shallow water. The ocean depth acts as a low-pass filter to translate seafloor uplift to sea surface elevation in tsunami generation (Kajiura, 1963), therefore any wavelengths shorter than ocean depth are not tsunamigenic. The width of the restraining bend here (3.5\u00a0km) is considerably larger than the depth of typical shallow bays and lakes (e.g., the deepest point of Palu Bay is ~800\u00a0m), therefore the short-wavelength inelastic uplift presented here can be highly tsunamigenic, as shown in the fully-coupled models. Due to the short wavelength of uplift, the produced tsunami is likely localized, which can have a large impact in narrow bays and lakes, as possibly observed in Palu Bay.\nThe mechanism is similar to inelastic wedge deformation in subduction zones (e.g., Ma and Nie, 2019). Inelastic wedge deformation was shown to cause efficient tsunamigenesis with diminishing shallow slip on the fault, which is plausible to explain the puzzling large tsunami runup on the Sanriku coast >100\u00a0km north of the epicenter in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, while being consistent with the differential bathymetry observations (Fujiwara et al., 2017). The width of inelastic seafloor uplift in Ma and Nie (2019) is about 20\u201325\u00a0km, which are short-wavelength compared to most elastic dislocation models, but are much larger than ocean depth (~7\u20138\u00a0km) to be tsunamigenic. This inelastic uplift was shown to produce impulsive tsunami, similar to what was observed along the Sanriku coast in the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, and generate large runup remarkably consistent with the runup of the 1896 Sanriku tsunami (Du et al., 2021). Here this mechanism is extended to strike-slip environments. Inelastic deformation may be intimately involved in tsunamigenesis in different tectonic settings.\nThe models here assume that the material within restraining bends is close to failure, which is motivated by the intense internal deformation over geological time. This same concept was introduced in the critical wedge theory for accretionary plate margins (e.g., Dahlen, 1984) and was used in the aforementioned inelastic wedge deformation models in subduction zones. A critical stress solution in transpressional and transtentional environments is derived here and used to set up the initial stress field. The local stress field at the transpressional bend is what determines the generation of inelastic uplift. In other words, in an overall transtentional regime large tsunamigenesis can also occur due to this mechanism if the local stress field at the restraining bend is transpressive. The models here use a homogeneous material. Sediments can further enhance inelastic off-fault failure and surface uplift due to weak strength. Future work may incorporate sediments and use a more heterogeneous stress drop distribution on the fault and real bathymetry to simulate a real earthquake and tsunami.\nThe direction of the minimum compressive stress is shown to control the efficiency of inelastic uplift. When the minimum compressive stress is vertical locally at restraining bends, similar to a subduction setting, the efficiency of producing inelastic uplift is maximum. This stress condition is expected from intense compression at restraining bends over geological time. When the minimum compressive stress is horizontal, as in a typical strike-slip setting, inelastic deformation (plastic flow) induces more horizontal motion. Models assuming horizontal minimum compressive stress may underestimate the effect of inelastic deformation on tsunamigenesis in a local transpressional setting. However, large localized inelastic uplift can still occur if the bend angle is large (Fig. S19).\nSupershear rupture can develop at optimally-oriented restraining bends. Models here assume an acute angle of maximum compressive stress with respect to the fault, mimicking the strike-slip faults developed due to oblique plate convergence or possibly faults with well-developed damage zones. Supershear ruptures are seen even after the rupture passes a 45\u00b0 restraining bend. This indicates that large restraining bends may not always act as a strong barrier to earthquake rupture. Both supershear rupture and large tsunamigenesis are co-existent in the models here, but large tsunamigenesis is due to inelastic off-fault deformation at restraining bends. Fully coupled model of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami in a narrow-shallow bay show that supershear strike-slip ruptures do not generate large tsunami; tsunami is only sensitive to static seafloor deformation. Large kinetic energy of supershear rupture is carried away by ocean acoustic waves.\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nDynamic off-fault failure at restraining bends is shown as an efficient tsunami generation mechanism for strike-slip earthquakes. The inelastic uplift is due to frictional sliding on microfractures with a thrust component generated by dynamic failure, which produces larger and more localized uplift than the one produced by elastic dislocation models. The localized inelastic uplift can produce short-wavelength tsunami that significantly impact shallow and narrow bays and lakes.\nFully-coupled models of dynamic rupture, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunami demonstrate that tsunami is mostly sensitive to static seafloor deformation. Models incorporating 3D time-dependent seafloor deformation into tsunami while ignoring ocean acoustic waves may overestimate the tsunami in a narrow bay. Supershear earthquakes on a vertical planar strike-slip fault do not produce large tsunami.\nThe tsunami hazards in strike-slip environments worldwide are likely underestimated. The current understanding of tsunamigenesis in a strike-slip environment involves mostly only submarine landslides and horizontal displacement of steep bathymetry. The presence of restraining bends and stepovers, such as in the Southern California Borderland, is recognized (Legg et al., 2007), but the tsunami hazards they impose are largely ignored. Other similar offshore regions with fault complexities are widespread. The inelastic deformation mechanism at fault complexities may need to be urgently incorporated in the current tsunami hazard assessments in strike-slip environments.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Video 1\n\nMovie of sea surface height for the four fully-coupled models showing clear ocean acoustic waves and various tsunamis.

Due to the continuous northward subduction of the Indian plate and the restriction of the surrounding rigid blocks, the crust of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau has thickened obviously and experienced severe tectonic deformation since the Late Cenozoic (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1978; Harrison et al., 1992; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Taylor and Yin, 2009). Many faults exist in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau formed by multi-block and multi-stage assemblage (Meyer et al., 1998; Ren and Xiao, 2004; Xu et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2009). At present, the large thrust and strike-slip faults have developed from north to south, e.g., the banded E-W trending Altyn Tagh fault, the N-S trending Helanshan fault and the Liupanshan fault, the NW-SE treading northern Qilian fault, the Haiyuan fault, the western Qinling fault as well as the eastern Kunlun fault, and the NE-SW trending Longmenshan fault. These faults divide the study region into different tectonic units, including the NW-SE trending Qilian orogen, the Qaidam basin, the Qinling orogen, the triangular Songpan-Garz\u00ea block, the Alxa block and the Ordos basin (Fig. 1a). Among them, the affiliation of the Alxa block remains controversial. Gong et al. (2015) proposed that the Alxa block and the Ordos basin belonged to the western NCC using geochronology and isotopes analysis methods. However, according to the sharp velocity contract that high S wave velocity is observed in the mid-to-lower crust under the Ordos basin and low S wave velocity is characterized beneath the Alxa block, X. Wang et al. (2017b) argued that the Alxa block was not a part of the NCC by jointly inverting receiver functions and surface wave dispersions. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate whether the Alxa block and the Ordos basin, belong to the western NCC.\nSeismologically, the study region is located in the northern portion of the South-North Seismic Zone as one of the most active seismic zones in the Chinese mainland (Zhang et al., 2003), which is a transitional zone with a width of about 200\u00a0km between the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and the Ordos basin. In the past, the devastating Mw 8 Haiyuan earthquake in 1920 and the Mw 8 Gulang earthquake in 1927 occurred in this region (Fig. 1a). The Haiyuan earthquake caused a surface rupture length of 220\u00a0km, about 600,000 casualties, the destruction of several tens of counties, and incalculable property losses. Tectonically, the study region is where the Tibetan plateau and the NCC met. Under the continuous northward subduction of the Indian plate and the obstruction of the surrounding rigid blocks, the deformation of this region is very intense during the Late Cenozoic. The Tibetan plateau, known as the \u201croof of the world\u201d, is the product of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Molnar et al., 1973; Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Patriat and Achache, 1984; Rowley, 1996; Molnar and Stock, 2009). As a whole, it shows a geomorphological pattern with a flat interior and steep periphery. A variety of models have been proposed to explain crustal shortening and thickening, lateral extrusion, and \u201cdisappearance\u201d of lithospheric material (Le et al., 1992). Correspondingly, three models related to the crustal growth of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau have been widely concerned, that is, the rigid block extrusion model (Tapponnier and Molnar, 1976; Tapponnier et al., 1982, 2001), the continuous deformation model (England and McKenize, 1982; England and Housman, 1986, 1989) and the mid-to-lower crustal channel flow model (Royden, 1996; Royden et al., 1997; Clark and Rayden, 2000; Clark et al., 2005). The NE margin of the Tibetan plateau is located in the edge of the plateau, with complex tectonic deformation and high seismic activity, so it is an ideal place to identify the three models mentioned above. According to the mid-to-lower crustal flow model, the southeast transport of deep crustal material is hindered from the Tibetan plateau to the rigid Sichuan basin, and then the Tibetan plateau material is bifurcated by the Sichuan basin into the NE margin and the southeastern (SE) margin of the Tibetan plateau. In the SE margin of the Tibetan plateau, it has been proved by various models that LVZs indicate the crustal flow exist in the mid-to-lower crust (Bai et al., 2010; Bao et al., 2015a; L. Li et al., 2016; Qiao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021). However, researchers have different views on whether the tectonic deformation pattern in the NE margin is the same as that in the SE margin. Some interprets the LVZs in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau as crustal channel flow (Klemperer, 2006; H. Li et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2021), while others do not support this model (England and Housman, 1986; C. Wang et al., 2008; Q. Wang et al., 2016; Pan and Niu, 2011; Tian et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Y. Li et al., 2006, 2017). We are curious about whether the LVZs also exist in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau, if so, what is the reason for its formation and what is possible tectonic deformation pattern in the NE margin. Therefore, a detailed investigation of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau is still necessary to understand the uplift process and northeastward expansion of the Tibetan plateau.\nStudying the seismic radial anisotropy can provide the most direct evidence of the flow and deformation in the earth's interior. Radial anisotropy is manifested by the difference of shear wave velocity obtained by Rayleigh wave and Love wave inversion. For transversely isotropic medium, there are two shear wave velocities, Vsh and Vsv, which are inferred from Love wave with horizontal polarization and Rayleigh wave with vertical polarization, respectively. And the velocity difference between them is referred to as Vs radial anisotropy, which is usually represented as the percentage difference between Vsh and Vsv. Generally, it is extremely difficult to directly observe the seismic radial anisotropy by the regionally propagating shear waves. Thus, it is essential to estimate the discrepancy between Vsv and Vsh models obtained from inverting Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves. Previous studies on the crustal radial anisotropy of the Tibetan plateau mainly focused on the SE margin (Huang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020). However, there are few studies on the crustal radial anisotropy in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau. Although Tan et al. (2015) and L. Li et al. (2016) imaged the crustal radial anisotropy with sparse stations and low resolution beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau, their results did not cover the regions of the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. Therefore, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the tectonic evolution of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding regions. It is necessary to use dense seismic array data in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau to obtain higher resolution radial anisotropy results.\nIn this paper, Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves (periods of 5\u201350\u00a0s) were firstly measured using three-component noise data recorded by temporary seismic stations in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding regions. Then, we adopted the DRadiSurfTomo method (Hu et al., 2020) to jointly invert Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data for a new 3-D average Vs and \u03be models in the study region. Finally, we discussed the mechanism of crustal deformation and the tectonic implications based on our new model.\n\n\n2\nData and method\nIn this paper, the range of the study region is 96\u00b0E-110\u00b0E and 31\u00b0N-41.5\u00b0N. The three-component waveforms used in this study were recorded by ChinArray Phase II consisting of 571 temporary seismic stations deployed in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding regions during 2014\/01\u20132015\/12 (Fig. 1b). The average station spacing was ~30\u00a0km. The seismometers were CMG-3ESP and CMG-3T within the 0.02\u201360\u00a0s and 0.02\u2013120\u00a0s frequency range, respectively. The data acquisition system was Reftek130 with a sampling rate of 50\u00a0samples per second (sps). Each station was equipped with GPS to ensure time consistency.\nWe processed the vertical and horizontal components of the continuous waveforms to obtain Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves. The specific noise data-processing steps followed Bensen et al. (2007) and Lin et al. (2008). The first step was single-station preprocessing. 1) the raw continuous three-component waveforms were cut to one-day length, and downsampled to 1\u00a0Hz to improve computational efficiency; 2) the means, trends, and instrument response were removed; then, the band-pass filtering (3\u201380\u00a0s) were applied; 3) the running absolute mean normalization was used to normalize the waveforms to eliminate the interference of seismic signals and other abnormal signals; 4) the spectral whitening technique was used to broaden the frequency band of the signals and suppress the interference of the single-frequency signal to obtain more continuous dispersion curves.\nAfter the single station preprocessing, the vertical-vertical (Z-Z) cross-correlation functions (CFs) could be extracted by the Z components of each station pair. To obtain transverse-transverse (T-T) CFs, the E-W and N-S horizontal components were rotated to the R (radial) and T components. The CFs consist of positive and negative lags (i.e., causal signal and acausal signal). A common phenomenon is that the two lags were asymmetric. This is due to the inhomogeneous distribution of noise sources (Wu et al., 2015). To eliminate this phenomenon and obtain more reliable measurements, the positive and negative components of the CFs were averaged to get the \u201csymmetrical components\u201d (Bensen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2007). Finally, Rayleigh and Love wave EGFs were obtained by stacking and deriving the \u201csymmetrical components\u201d of the CFs. Fig. 2\n shows the symmetric Rayleigh and Love EGFs within the period band 5\u201350\u00a0s sorted by the epicentral distance between the station 15,590 and all other stations.\nIn order to ensure the reliability of our results, we first removed the CFs with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) lower than 18. Here, we defined SNR as the ratio of peak amplitude of the signal window to the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of 150\u00a0s long noise window right after signal window. For the remaining CFs with high SNRs, we used the image transformation technique (Yao et al., 2006) to measure Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocity dispersion curves with the period range of 5\u201350\u00a0s. To improve the reliability of the measurements, we imposed several selection criteria in the data processing. The station pair spacing should be at least two wavelengths to satisfy the far-field approximation. We further divided all dispersion curves into two parts, one was the dispersion curves of station pairs in the same geological block, and the other was the dispersion curves of station pairs between blocks. For the dispersion curves of the station pairs in the same block, the criteria include the following: 1) the mean value and the standard deviation of the mean value at each period (with an interval of 1\u00a0s) were calculated; 2) all dispersion measurements of each period outside two times standard deviation range were removed; 3) for each dispersion curve, it would be removed if the number of the period band is smaller than 4. The criteria of the dispersion curves for all station pairs between blocks include the following: 1) the mean value and the standard deviation of the mean value at each period were calculated; 2) all dispersion measurements of each period outside two times standard deviation range were removed; 3) the dispersion curves with the epicenter distance larger than 800\u00a0km as well as the number of the period band smaller than 8 were removed. Finally, we re-screened the two parts of the dispersion curves manually to remove the dispersion curves which were obviously different tread with most of curves and saved more reasonable dispersion curves as the dispersion data for the final inversion. Fig. 3a, b show the selected Rayleigh and Love wave phase velocity dispersion curves in the period band of 5\u201350\u00a0s, and Fig. 3c, d show the numbers of Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion measurements at each period. The numbers of dispersion measurements were >5000 at most of periods. Overall, measurements of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves were more than that of Love wave dispersion curves, mainly because the SNR of T-component waveforms was relatively low. Fig. 4\n shows the data coverage of Rayleigh and Love wave at a period of 20\u00a0s. Ray paths of Rayleigh and Love wave were quite dense and crossed in most of the study region, which indicated the robustness of our final results.\nIn this study, we adopted the DRadiSurfTomo method (Hu et al., 2020) to simultaneously invert Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data to obtain the 3-D Vs and \u03be models. Vs and \u03be are parameterized in the 3-D model so that the radial anisotropy could be inverted directly without the division operation of Vsh over Vsv, which is different from conventional approach of parameterizing the models as (Vsh, Vsv) and then calculating (Vs, \u03be) pointwisely. The model parameters are modified from (Vsh, Vsv) to (Vsv, \u03b3) according to the definition of a dimensionless parameter \u03b3 (\n\u03b3\n=\n\n\nV\nsh\n\n\nV\nsv\n\n\n). Then, the linearized inversion problem can be written as:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2206\n\nT\nR\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2206\n\nT\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nG\nsv\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u00b7\n\nG\nsh\n\n\n\n\nV\nsv\n\n\u00b7\n\nG\nsh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2206\n\nV\nsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2206\n\u03b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u2206TR and \u2206TL denote the perturbation of Rayleigh and Love wave traveltime vectors respectively; Gsv and Gsh denote the 3-D sensitivity matrix for surface wave traveltime related to Vsv and Vsh respectively; Vsv and \u03b3 are the reference velocity and anisotropy models; the manipulation \u2018\u2022\u2019 is the element-wise matrix production. After obtaining the 3-D (Vsv, \u03b3) models by solving iteratively for equation (1) using the standard linearized approach, we use \n\nV\nsv\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n+\n1\n\n2\n\n and \n\n\n2\n\n\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n+\n1\n\n\n to calculate the average Vs and \u03be. In fact, the direct surface wave inversion (DSurfTomo) method implemented by Fang et al. (2015) is used to calculate the pseudo 3-D sensitivity matrix Gsv and Gsh, which takes into account the period-dependent ray bending effects (Rawlinson and Sambridge, 2004). During each iteration, the damped least square inversion algorithm (LSMR) (Fong and Saunders, 2011) is used to solve equation (1). The first-order smoothing parameters \u03bbsv and \u03bb\u03b3 are directly added to the 3-D Vsv and \u03b3 models, so the instability problem of the inversion can be effectively mitigated. The 1-D average initial Vsv model in this study referred to the results (Bao et al., 2015b) obtained from jointly inverting ambient noise and earthquake data. Then, we set \u03be\u00a0=\u00a00 as the initial \u03be model (Fig. 5a).\nWe analyzed the effect of smoothing parameters on model roughness and surface wave traveltime data residuals by L-curve tests and determined the optimal \u03bbsv and \u03bb\u03b3 by a trade-off. Specifically, first, \u03bb\u03b3 was given to be 35, and then different \u03bbsv was used for inversion. We plotted the inversion results in the coordinate system with the surface wave traveltime data residuals as the abscissa and the model roughness as the ordinate, and an L-shaped curve could be obtained. The value of \u03bbsv was marked on the corresponding solid circle of the coordinate system (Fig. 6a), and a proper trade-off could be processed between the model roughness and surface wave traveltime data residuals, i.e., the point with the largest curvature in the L-shaped curve was usually selected as the optimal \u03bbsv. The optimal \u03bbsv we chose was 25. Then the value of \u03bbsv was fixed to 25, adjusting the \u03bb\u03b3 for inversion, and also marking the value of \u03bb\u03b3 on the corresponding solid circle to obtain a new L-shaped curve. By using the similar L-curve analysis above, we got the value of optimal \u03bb\u03b3 to be 25 (Fig. 6b). In this paper, we took the inversion models obtained by \u03bbsv = 25 and \u03bb\u03b3 = 25 as the final tomographic results.\nTo better understand tomographic resolving ability, we performed the checkerboard test. The perturbation of Vs and \u03be relative to average models were set to \u00b1 0.5\u00a0km\/s and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% on each grid point of 0.5\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00b0, respectively. Besides, 1% random noise was added to Rayleigh and Love wave traveltime data. The input models with anomaly sizes of 1.0\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0\u00b0 (Fig. 7\n) and 1.5\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00b0 (Fig. S1) could be properly recovered at different depths. For the input model with anomaly size of 0.5\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00b0 (Fig. S2), we noticed that the smearing effects emerged at depth of 52.5\u00a0km due to inadequate interstation ray paths distribution. After the comparison of different anomaly sizes, 1.0\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.0\u00b0 anomaly size of Vs and \u03be in the horizontal direction might be more appropriate for the final model inversion. The checkerboard tests (Fig. 7) show the checkerboard models of Vs and \u03be can be well recovered down to the depth of 50\u00a0km in the study region, and can suppress at least 1% random noise in the traveltime data. Even for deep structures (e.g., 52.5\u00a0km), the checkerboards of Vs and \u03be can recover very well except for some marginal regions. Additionally, we performed another checkerboard test to provide the information on the trade-off between the isotropic Vs and the anisotropic parameters. The true model only contained the isotropic Vs part with the anisotropic part all being zeros. Then we plugged the isotropic model into the inversion but the anisotropic parameters were still allowed to vary. The checkerboard results (Fig. S3) show that the resulted radial anisotropy are almost all zeros and the input isotropic Vs anomalies can be well recovered at different depths, which indicates that when the input model is only isotropic Vs model, the anisotropic parameters seem to have little influence on the resolution. We outlined the range of the final tomography (the red dashed lines in Fig. 7) based on the results of the density of ray paths and checkerboard tests.\n\n\n3\nResults\nAccording to the sensitive depth of the longest period at 50\u00a0s shown in Fig. 5b, and c, the maximal resolved depth was expected to be 60\u00a0km in our final Vs and \u03be models with 0.5\u00b0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00b0 grid points well obtained from joint inversion of Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data using the DRadiSurfTomo method. We performed another tomography inversion using the results of Shen et al. (2016) as the initial model to evaluate the stability of the inversion method. Two random 1-D S-wave velocity models located in the northern Qilian orogen and the western Qinling orogen are extracted from 3-D S-wave velocity models to compare the similarity of these two tomographic results (Fig. S4). Fig. S4 shows that these two 1-D final models are highly similar, and their correlation coefficients are both >0.98, which can reflect the reliability of the resolved features. Fig. 8\n presents Vs and \u03be horizontal slices at depths of 5, 12.5, 22.5, 32.5, 42.5, and 52.5\u00a0km. These images show depth-dependent patterns.\nAt depth of 5\u00a0km, the Vs model shows clear low Vs anomalies at the location of the Yinchuan-Hetao basin, the Sichuan basin, and the Ordos basin, which corresponds to the widely distributed and thick Tertiary sediments and Quaternary loess. The weaker low Vs anomalies can be found in the Alxa block, which may be related to the sedimentary layer revealed by results of Zheng et al. (2018). The western Qinling orogen, the Qilian orogen, and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block exhibit high Vs anomalies. At depth of 12.5\u00a0km, S wave velocities are generally high in the Qilian orogen, the Ordos basin, and the Yinchuan-Hetao basin, in obvious contrast to low S wave velocities in the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block. The velocity pattern in the Alxa block is characterized by alternating low Vs anomalies and high Vs anomalies. At depth of 22.5\u00a0km, the northern Qilian orogen, the western Qinling orogen, and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block are characterized by significantly low S wave velocities. High S wave velocities are present in the Ordos basin and the Sichuan basin. At depth of 32.5\u00a0km, there are apparent low Vs anomalies in the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block and the western Qinling orogen, and the low Vs anomalies below the Qilian orogen have almost expanded to the whole range. However, high Vs anomalies appear beneath the Ordos basin and the Alxa block. At depth of 42.5\u00a0km, the range of low Vs anomalies is relatively contractive in the Qilian orogen, the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block and the western Qinling orogen. At 52.5\u00a0km depth, it shows high Vs anomalies in the most study regions. According to the crustal thickness distribution in Fig. 10a, the depth of 52.5\u00a0km in these areas is within the range of the upper mantle. On the contrary, some areas of the northern Qilian orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block exhibit low Vs anomalies, indicating that the corresponding depth still belongs to the crust.\nThe \u03be is generally negative at depth of 5\u00a0km, especially along the northern Qilian fault, the western Qinling fault, the Haiyuan fault, and the eastern Kunlun fault. At depth of 12.5\u00a0km, the study region is roughly divided into negative \u03be (Vsh < Vsv) in the southwest and positive \u03be (Vsh > Vsv) in the northeast bounded by the northern Qilian fault and the Haiyuan fault. It exhibits negative \u03be along the northern Qilian fault, the western Qinling fault, the Haiyuan fault, and the eastern Kunlun fault, while positive \u03be exists in the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. At depths of 22.5, 32.5, 42.5, and 52.5\u00a0km, the study region can be approximately divided into two parts bounded by the northern Qilian fault and the Haiyuan fault. The apparent positive \u03be is dominated in both northeast and southwest parts.\nWe further used the jackknife resampling technique (Tukey, 1958; Wu, 1986; Tichelaar and Ruff, 1989; Hu et al., 2020) to calculate the posterior standard derivation of the inverted Vs and \u03be models. In detail, first, 80% of Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data were randomly selected as the inversion data; then 230 corresponding inversion results were obtained by using the same initial models and smoothing parameters for 230 times of inversion; finally, the Vs and \u03be standard derivation of the 230 inversion models were calculated (\u03c3s for Vs and \u03c3\u03be for \u03be). Fig. 9\n shows that the standard derivation \u03c3s is generally smaller than 0.015\u00a0km\/s, and \u03c3\u03be is generally smaller than 0.5% in the study region, which reflects that the model errors are very small even using 80% traveltime data for inversion.\nTo better explore the relationship between the deep structure and the surface topography in the study region, we plotted the average Vs (Fig. 10b, d, and f) and \u03be (Fig. 10c, e, and g) vertical cross-sections along three different profiles in Fig. 10a, which help us further understand the depth distribution characteristics of Vs and \u03be. In the discussion part, we will describe the depth-dependent patterns of Vs and \u03be in more detail.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nComparisons with other studies\nThe average Vs and \u03be models in the study region show that Vs and \u03be are depth-dependent beneath different blocks. The distribution of our observed high and low anomalies generally agrees with previous Vsv (Yang et al., 2012; Bao et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2014; H. Li et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2018; Hao et al., 2021), Vsh (Xu et al., 2015), and Vp (Lei and Zhao, 2016; He and Santosh, 2017; Xia et al., 2021) models obtained from passive seismic data. These results also showed that the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau was characterized by low Vs anomalies, while mid-to-lower crust was characterized by high Vs anomalies beneath the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. However, our obtained model also presents some differences in detail compared with previous results. For example, our observed low and high anomalies in the upper-to-mid crust are divided by the northern Qilian fault and the Haiyuan fault, suggesting that the distribution of the anomalies is more consistent with the boundaries of geological blocks. In addition, the high Vs anomaly within the mid-to-lower crust obtained from Rayleigh wave dispersion (K. Wang et al., 2020) only presents in the Ordos basin, which is different from our results that both the Alxa block and the Ordos basin are dominated by significant high Vs anomalies. Due to the simultaneous inversion of Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data in this study, our obtained Vs anomalies may better reflect the geological structure beneath the study region, which may be the reason for the differences mentioned above.\nOur new \u03be model is similar to the results of Xie et al. (2013), but different from the model of Tan et al. (2015), and L. Li et al. (2016) in many details, e.g., negative \u03be is generally observed in the upper crust, while positive \u03be is generally observed in the middle crust under the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau in both Xie et al. (2013) and our model. In addition, positive \u03be is observed within the middle crust of the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block and the northern Qilian orogen in both Tan et al. (2015) and our model. However, the distribution and value of \u03be are distinctive. The distribution of our \u03be roughly agrees with the results of L. Li et al. (2016), but the extension range and the depth position of \u03be from negative to positive are obviously different. Besides, the distribution of their stations was relatively sparse, and the study region did not include the Alxa block and the Ordos basin as well as other regions around the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau. This led to their limited understanding of the tectonic evolution process in this region.\n\n\n4.2\nCrustal deformation beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau\nSeismic radial anisotropy is a key property to characterize crustal deformation. The layered \u03be patterns indicate that the crustal deformation in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau varies with depth. Since ~50\u00a0Ma, the continuous collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates caused the crustal thickness of the Tibetan plateau and formed a series of fold belts. These crustal deformations might induce the formation of shallow crustal cracks and large strike-slip faults. The results of \u03be (Xie et al., 2013) in eastern Tibet and surrounding regions implied that the near-vertical cracks and faults could cause negative \u03be in the upper crust. In our upper crustal \u03be model (Fig. 8d, e), the apparent negative \u03be is present beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau (especially around the northern Qilian fault, the western Qinling fault, the Haiyuan fault and the eastern Kunlun fault). Additionally, GPS measurements show that strong crustal shear strain exists in the vicinity of some major strike-slip faults in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau (e.g., the Haiyuan fault and the eastern Kunlun fault), and the direction of the maximum shear strain is parallel with these strike-slip faults (Gan et al., 2007). This shear strain was consistent with the negative \u03be in this paper obtained beneath the northern Qilian fault, the western Qinling fault, the Haiyuan fault, and the eastern Kunlun fault. Recently, the anisotropic tomography of Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion (Hao et al., 2021) shows that the fast directions in the upper crust are almost parallel with major strike-slip faults (e.g., the Kunlun fault, the Haiyuan fault, the Qinling fault, and the Qilian fault). Combined with above results, we propose that the anisotropy in the upper crust of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau is induced by the shear motion of large strike-slip faults and the preferred vertical alignment for cracks accompanying the large strike-slip faults.\nThe middle crust of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau is dominated by low Vs (Fig. 8c, g). In general, the low seismic wave velocity is usually caused by two factors: one is the change in material composition, such as different minerals or the presence of fluids; the other is the change in the state of the material, such as thermal anomalies or partial melting. Yang et al. (2012) took the shear velocity <3.4\u00a0km\/s at 30\u00a0km depth as an indicator of partial melting. We also contoured the LVZs with Vs\u00a0=\u00a03.4 km\/s in Fig. 10f. The obvious LVZ anomalies exhibiting in the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block indicate that the partial melting may have occurred in these regions. This speculation could be also confirmed by various geophysical studies, including high electrical conductivity (Bai et al., 2010; Zhan et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2015), relatively high surface heat flow (Hu et al., 2000), high Vp\/Vs ratio (Yue et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014; X. Wang et al., 2017a) and low Q value (Zhao et al., 2013). The \u03be in the middle crust is mainly contributed to the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of mica (Zhang and Karato, 1995; Nishizawa and Yoshino, 2001; Erdman et al., 2013). For example, the preferred horizontal orientation of the fast wave axes of mica crystals can lead to positive \u03be; on the contrary, the preferred vertical orientation of the fast wave axes can result in negative \u03be. Our \u03be model shows that there is an apparent transition from negative to positive as the depth increases from 5 to 22.5\u00a0km (Fig. 8d, f) in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau. At depths of 22.5 and 32.5\u00a0km (Figs. 8f, g and 10c, e, and g), positive \u03be could be found in the middle crust. We infer that this anisotropic pattern is due to the preferred horizontal orientation of the fast wave axes of anisotropic minerals caused by partial melting in the middle crust. Moreover, the distributions of the LVZs and positive \u03be show a certain correlation with the strikes of the eastern Kunlun fault and the western Qinling fault with slip rates 10\u201312\u00a0mm\/yr (Fleitout and Froidevaux, 1980; Leloup et al., 1999) and 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr (Gan et al., 2007), respectively. Therefore, we consider that the observed LVZ and positive \u03be in the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block are related to the partial melting of the middle crust caused by the relative movement of the blocks along the faults. Fleitout and Froidevaux (1980) as well as Leloup et al. (1999) suggested that the shear heating caused by this relative movement was an important reason for the temperature rise in the crust. However, it is generally impossible for the Kunlun fault to increase the temperature above 200\u00a0\u00b0C by the shear heating at speed of 10\u201312\u00a0mm\/yr. L. Li et al. (2013) and X. Wang et al. (2017b) observed the low velocity anomalies in the upper mantle and inferred that the asthenospheric upwelling would occur beneath the western Qinling orogen. This hot mantle flow provided another source to heat the overlying crust and transform the crustal composition from quartz-dioritic to mafic materials by the detachment of the thick lithosphere root (Gao et al., 1992), which is consistent with the low Vs anomalies (Fig. 10f) and positive \u03be (Fig. 10g) observed in the mid-to-lower crust. Based on the above analysis, we suggest that the LVZs and positive \u03be caused by partial melting beneath the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block may be due to the combined effect of the shear heating and asthenospheric upwelling.\nIn contrast to the LVZs in the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block, the Vs beneath the northern Qilian orogen (Fig. 10b, d) is no <3.4\u00a0km\/s and obviously higher than that under the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block. As mentioned above, this Vs (> 3.4\u00a0km\/s) will not be related to the crustal partial melting (Yang et al., 2012). Moreover, the lower Poisson's ratio (< 0.23, X. Wang et al., 2017a), low-moderate surface heat flow (< 70 mW\/m2, Y. Wang, 2001) and high resistivity (1\u201310 \u03a9m, Xiao et al., 2012) further demonstrated the fact that there would be no crustal partial melting beneath the northern Qilian orogen, which agrees with the results of Xie et al. (2013). The depth range of the LVZ beneath the northern Qilian orogen is about 30\u201340\u00a0km (Fig. 10b, d), which is deeper than that (15\u201330\u00a0km, Fig. 10f) beneath the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block and the western Qinling orogen. Hacker et al. (2014) suggested that the depth of the partial melting in the mid-to-lower crust of the Tibetan plateau was more likely at 20\u201330\u00a0km. This estimate is also inconsistent with our observed depth of 30\u201340\u00a0km beneath the Qilian orogen. In Fig. 10a, b, the LVZ and thicker crustal thickness, >60\u00a0km, are measured beneath the Qilian orogen. According to the statistics of the earthquakes (M\u00a0>\u00a05.0) in the Qilian orogen (Y. Li et al., 2017; X. Wang et al., 2017b), most of the moderate to large earthquakes only occurred in the upper crust (< 20\u00a0km), which indicates that the upper crust is brittle and the mid-to-lower crust may be ductile (Y. Li et al., 2017). Previous results of Rayleigh wave tomography (Y. Li et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) also suggested that the ductile mid-to-lower crust could be found in the Qilian orogen. Xu et al. (2018) revealed that the crustal deformation of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau was attributed to the thickening of the ductile mid-to-lower crust, which indicates the corresponding positive \u03be shown in Figs. 8f, j and 10c. After the above analysis, we believe that the crustal low Vs anomalies and positive \u03be in the northern Qilian orogen are more likely to be related to the ductile crustal thickening.\nWhether the mid-to-lower crustal flow exists widely in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau, like that in the SE margin of the Tibetan plateau, is still under debate. Huang et al. (2010) and Chen et al. (2018) suggested that the positive \u03be related to the crustal flow was quite strong, >4%, beneath the SE margin of the Tibetan plateau. However, our observed \u03be is relatively weak (1\u20132%) beneath the regions from the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block to the Qilian orogen, which may not be sufficient to indicate the existence of the crustal flow. In addition, the observed LVZs of these regions are possibly caused by the crustal partial melting and the ductile crustal thickening as we deduced above. Combined with previous studies on the Poisson's ratio (Xu et al., 2007) and heat flow (Y. Wang, 2001), we suggest that the extensive mid-to-lower channel flow should not occur beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau.\n\n\n4.3\nCrustal deformation and implications for the Alxa block\nThe NE margin of the Tibetan plateau are surrounded by the stable Inner Mongolia Fold belt, the Yinchuan-Hetao basin, the Ordos basin as well as the Sichuan basin and the Alxa block. Among these blocks, the Alxa block has always been controversial regarding its affiliation and evolutionary history. Dan et al. (2012) suggested that the Alxa block was a Paleoproterozoic terrane separated from the western NCC. Based on the U-Pb ages and Hf isotope data of clastic zircons, Wei and Yang (2015) believed that the Alxa block was not part of the NCC during the Middle-Late Devonian. However, other studies (e.g., Wan et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2009; J. Li et al., 2012; Yuan and Yang, 2015) argued that the Alxa block, as the westernmost part of the NCC, was one of the Archean micro-continental blocks and was integrated into the NCC in the Neoarchean or Paleozoic. In this study, we try to further discuss the affiliation of the Alxa block based on the seismological evidence of Vs and \u03be. In Fig. 8, we find that the intensity of the Vs anomalies beneath the Alxa block is almost equivalent to that under the Ordos basin at each Vs slice. This pattern of Vs is basically the same as the previous studies (Guo et al., 2017). In addition, the distribution of \u03be beneath the Alxa block and the Ordos basin is slightly different, but not obviously divided into two regions. In Fig. 10a, the crustal thickness of the two blocks varies between 45 and 50\u00a0km. Chang et al. (2017) showed the consistent fast directions of SKS phase were observed in the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. Therefore, we propose that the Alxa block and the Ordos basin as a whole are a part of the NCC.\nDue to the continuous northeastward growth of the Tibetan plateau and the obstruction of the rigid Alxa block and the Ordos basin, the strong crustal deformation happened in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau (Shen et al., 2017; X. Wang et al., 2017a; Xu et al., 2018). In terms of the surface topographic relief, this deformation seems to only appear in the south of the northern Qilian fault and the Haiyuan fault (Fig. 1). As a part of the western NCC, the Alxa block and the Ordos basin show significant high Vs and positive \u03be on the whole (Fig. 8). However, the Vs and the corresponding \u03be of the crust show a different pattern around the boundary from the northern Qilian fault to the Haiyuan fault. In Fig. 8, we find that the obvious low Vs in the mid-to-lower crust cross over the northern Qilian fault and the Haiyuan fault, and intrude into the southwestern and southeastern margin of the Alxa block. Besides, the stronger \u03be can also be identified in these regions, which indicates that the mid-to-lower crust is relatively weak and easy to deform. This is consistent with the conclusion that the Tibetan plateau encroached unevenly upon the strength of the encountering blocks suggested by the zigzag front of Moho depth (magenta dashed line in Fig. 10a, Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, we speculate that the crustal structure beneath the southwestern and southeastern margin of the Alxa block may be modified by the far-field stress that originated from the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, and the deformation is mainly concentrated on the boundary areas where the crust strength is relatively weak.\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nIn this study, we obtain Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data (T\u00a0=\u00a05\u201350\u00a0s) in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and its adjacent regions by image transformation technique (Yao et al., 2006) from continuous waveforms recorded by the ChinArray Phase II dense temporary seismic array. Then, the 3-D high resolution crustal average Vs and \u03be models are obtained simultaneously by using the DRadiSurfTomo method (Hu et al., 2020). Our main conclusions include:\nThe upper crust and the mid-to-lower crust of the study region generally exhibit negative and positive \u03be, respectively, indicating that the crustal deformation pattern varies depth-dependently. The negative \u03be exhibited in the upper crust of the study region may be caused by the shear motion of large strike-slip faults and the preferred vertical alignment for cracks.\nIn the middle crust of the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau, the \u03be is generally positive. The LVZ and positive \u03be caused by partial melting beneath the western Qinling orogen and the Songpan-Garz\u00ea block may be due to the combined effect of shear heating and asthenosoheric upwelling. The LVZ and positive \u03be in the northern Qilian orogen are more likely to be related to the ductile crustal thickening. Additionally, we suggest that there is no mid-to-lower crustal channel flow in the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau.\nThe HVZ and positive \u03be are exhibited in the middle crust of the Alxa block and the Ordos basin, which is related to the intruded magmatic rocks aligned sub-horizontally beneath the Alxa block and the Ordos basin. Furthermore, we support the Alxa block, similar to the Ordos basin, belongs to a part of the NCC.\nBy analyzing the Vs and \u03be models between the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and the western NCC, we suggest that the rigid crust of the Alxa block and Ordos basin effectively hinders the northeastward expansion of the Tibetan plateau, but the crustal deformation between the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau and the western NCC is unevenly distributed.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nTianyang Gao: Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Data curation, Visualization, Formal analysis.

The main mechanisms proposed to date are a) far-field tensile tectonic forces due to the subduction of the Tethyan slab below the Zagros suture zone (e.g., Bellahsen et al., 2003), b) emplacement of the African plume that may have caused diffuse lithospheric weakening (e.g., Bellahsen et al., 2003) and c) a combination of these mechanisms (e.g., Petrunin et al., 2020).\nSeveral analogue and numerical models have been developed in recent years that focus on different aspects, such as the role of the subduction-collision process on Arabia-Africa separation and on intraplate stresses, which generated the Red Sea-Gulf of Aden rift system (Bellahsen et al., 2003); the effect of oblique rifting on the fault geometry (Autin et al., 2010, 2013); the reactivation of preexisting faults and rift localization (Bellahsen et al., 2006) and their roles in controlling the geometry and the kinematics of rifts (Autin et al., 2013); interactions between local and far-field tectonic stresses in an evolving rift system (Brune and Autin, 2013); the importance of mantle strength (Gueydan et al., 2008), rheology and composition on the formation of passive margins, ocean-continent transition zones and oceanic basins (Watremez et al., 2013); the structural consequences of crustal necking processes and of the degree of mechanical decoupling during a relatively continuous extensional event (Chenin et al., 2018); the influence of erosion\/sedimentation on the rifting process (Beucher and Huismans, 2020); and the overall effect of inherited obliquity and changes in relative plate motions along continent-ocean transform margins (Farangitakis et al., 2020). However, many questions remain debated, such as the timing and nature of the rifting and why the ocean-continent transition zone did not develop along the entire oceanic margins.\nTo shed light on these issues, we implemented a set of numerical models that simulate the passive rifting of lithosphere with varying crustal thickness and initial thermal configuration, whose predictions in terms of timing and petrological characteristics of the phases of rifting make it possible to discriminate among different tectonic hypotheses. Models are founded on integrated modeling of elevation, geoid data and thermal analysis and account for the present-day kinematics observed between the Arabian plate and Africa (Nubia) and Somalia. Rather than being interested on ridge propagation mode as a function of ridge parallel inflow or obliquity, requiring a 3D modeling formulation as for Jourdon et al. (2020) or on the effects of a 3D weak zone in the lower crust as for Liao and Gerya (2015), we are herein interested on the timing of occurrence of oceanization and serpentinization which makes a 2D formulation the preferred one. This 2D formulation allows us to focus on the basic physics of the rifting processes along transects perpendicular to the ridge, focusing the analysis on the central portion of the Gulf of Aden, encompassed between the Shukra-el-Sheik fracture zone and Alula-Fartak fracture zone, which is in fact a 2D structure. Furthermore, within our 2D formulation we implement the formation of oceanic crust by partial melting and magma crystallization, generally not considered in 3D formulations.\n\n\n2\nTectonic setting\nThe Gulf of Aden is a young oceanic basin situated between southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa that links the Ethiopian rift and the Red Sea with the Carlsberg Ridge in the NW Indian Ocean.\nThe rifting started at approximately 40\u201335\u00a0Ma (Watchorn et al., 1998; Watremez et al., 2011), followed by oceanic spreading at approximately 19\u201318\u00a0Ma at the Sheba Ridge, in the eastern part of the Gulf (Bosworth et al., 2005; Watremez et al., 2011; Shuler and Nettles, 2012; Bosworth, 2015). Later, the ridge propagated westward into the central Gulf of Aden by 16\u00a0Ma and, at 10\u00a0Ma, over 300\u00a0km from the central Gulf of Aden to the Shukra al Sheik discontinuity (Bosworth et al., 2005; Bosworth, 2015). Rifting stalled there and propagated west of the Shukra-el-Sheik discontinuity only during the last 2\u20133\u00a0Ma (Shuler and Nettles, 2012). The age of the oceanic crust thus becomes progressively younger westward. The spreading rate increases from 13\u00a0mm\/yr in the west to ~23\u00a0mm\/yr in the east (ArRajehi et al., 2010; Autin et al., 2010).\nThe general trend of the Gulf of Aden is WSW\u2013ENE (N70\u00b0E) while the present-day spreading direction ranges between N25\u00b0E to the east and N35\u00b0E to the west, indicating an oblique rifting (Huchon and Khanbari, 2003).\nThe oceanic domain of the gulf may be divided into three sectors (western, central and eastern sectors, Fig. 1\n) by the Shukra-el\u2013Sheik Fracture Zone (SSFZ), the Alula-Fartak Fracture Zone (AFFZ) and the Socotra-Hadbeen Fracture Zone (SHFZ) (Leroy et al., 2010). The eastern sector (light red area in Fig. 1) extends from the Alula-Fartak transform fault to the eastern border of the African craton (Leroy et al., 2012) and shows an extremely thin transitional crust at the Ocean-Continent Transition (OCT), which most likely involves exhumed serpentinized mantle rocks indicating a magma-poor setting (Leroy et al., 2012). The central sector (light yellow area in Fig. 1) of the Gulf lies between the SSFZ and the AFFZ (Leroy et al., 2012) and, as in the eastern sector, the margins here are thought to be either magma-poor, or of intermediate-type, as no magmatic structures, such as seaward-dipping reflectors have been recognized in the OCT. In fact, Nonn et al. (2019) propose that the central Gulf of Aden is composed of hybrid margins (or intermediate-type, Larsen et al., 2018), transitional between magma-rich and magma-poor margins, in the western and eastern parts of the central sector, respectively. Their analysis of marine geophysical and geological data reveals that at the western boundary of central sector, near the XAMFZ, magmatic processes are predominant and the higher thermal regime is associated with the development of SDRs wedges from the late phase of the thinning of the continental crust (early Miocene-\u00a0~\u00a021\u00a0Ma) up to the exhumation phase (Burdigalian-\u00a0~\u00a018\u00a0Ma) that lead to the OCT development. East of BHFZ, the Bosaso-Sayhut margins segment is characterized by magma-poor margins for which the exhumation stage is characterized by the unroofing of mantle along multiple detachment faults in the OCT and shortly followed by diachronous volcanism (~18\u00a0Ma) (Nonn et al., 2019). The OCT on the northern margin of the central sector is wider in the eastern segment (\u223c23\u201345\u00a0km) than in the western segment (\u223c17\u201333\u00a0km), and on the southern margin, it is wider in the Bosaso-Sayhut segment (\u223c23\u00a0km) than in the Ahl-Medo-Hami segment (\u223c10\u201320\u00a0km) (Nonn et al., 2019). The difference in width of the conjugate OCT highlights the asymmetry of the Yemeni and Somalian margins (Nonn et al., 2019).\nThe western sector (cyan area in Fig. 1) extends from the active rift of the Gulf of Tadjoura to the SSFZ (Leroy et al., 2012). West of the SSFZ, the system was heated up by the strong influence of the Afar plume, which led to breakup with much less extension, inducing the development of volcanic rifted margins in the western part of the Gulf of Aden (Leroy et al., 2012). In fact, the major discontinuity of Shukra-el-Sheik (Fig. 1) may indicate the limit of the Afar plume influence and corresponds to a major change in the rheology of the lithosphere (Basuyau et al., 2010).\n\n\n3\nConceptual model\n\n3.1\nModel setup\nThe physics of the crust\u2013mantle system during the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading is described by the equations of conservation of mass, momentum and energy for incompressible fluids:\n\n(1)\n\n\u2207\n\u00b7\nu\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212\n\u2207\np\n+\n\u2207\n\u00b7\n\u03c4\n+\n\u03c1\ng\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c1\n\nC\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nT\n\n\n\u2202\nt\n\n\n+\nu\n\u00b7\n\u2207\nT\n\n\n=\n\u2207\n\u00b7\n\n\nK\n\u2207\nT\n\n\n+\nH\n\n\nwhere u is the velocity, p is the pressure, \n\u03c4\n is the deviatoric stress, \u03c1 is the density, \ng\n is the gravitational acceleration, C\n\np\n is the heat capacity at constant pressure, T is the temperature, K is the thermal conductivity and H is the total internal heating per unit mass.\nEqs. (1), (2) and (3) are integrated using the 2D finite element code SubMar (Marotta et al., 2006) in a 1400\u00a0km-wide and 700\u00a0km-deep rectangular domain (Fig. 2\n).\nThe domain is discretized by a non-deforming irregular grid composed of 5836 quadratic triangular elements and 11,889 nodes. The sizes of the elements vary, with the highest nodal density localized near the future rifting zone, where the most significant gradients in temperature and velocity fields are expected. SubMar uses the streamline upwind\/Petrov-Galerkin method to integrate the equation for the conservation of energy and the penalty function formulation (Sewell, 1982) to solve for pressure p:\n\n\np\n=\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\n\u2202\nu\n\n\n\u2202\nx\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u2202\nv\n\n\n\u2202\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bb is the penalty parameter, chosen to be large enough to guarantee a small change in volume so that the fluid can be considered almost incompressible. We assumed \n\u03bb\n=\n\u03bc\n\n\nr\np\n\n\n, where r\n\np\n represents the machine precision and \u03bc is the bulk viscosity (Hughes et al., 1979; Donea and Huerta, 2003; Marotta et al., 2006; Thieulot, 2014).\nThe marker in-cell technique (e.g., Christensen, 1992) is used to compositionally differentiate the different types of materials with 514,009 markers spatially distributed with a density of 1 marker per 0.25\u00a0km2, identifying through a specific index the material particles of air\/water, continental crust, non-serpentinized and serpentinized mantle. Mantle markers have been distributed only along a 200\u00a0km-wide vertical column centered at the future ridge position (yellow zone in Fig. 2a). This permitted to assure a high marker concentration and, at same time, to limit the total number of markers and optimize the time consuming. Such marker distribution resulted appropriate to identify those markers involved in the processes under study. During the evolution of the system, each marker is advected using a 4th-order (both in time and in space) Runge\u2013Kutta scheme. Based on the number of markers of type i that reside at each time within each element e, N\n\ni\n\n\ne\n, each weighted average elemental property P\n\ne\n can be defined as follows:\n\n\n\nP\ne\n\n=\n\nP\nm\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\n\nN\ni\ne\n\n\nN\n0\ne\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\nP\ni\n\n\n\nN\ni\ne\n\n\nN\n0\ne\n\n\n\n\nwhere P\n\nm\n and P\n\ni\n are the values of the properties for the mantle and for any particles of type i, respectively, and N\n\ni\n\n\ne\n is the maximum number of particles of any type that element e may contain. Regarding the elemental density \u03c1\n\ne\n, we assume that it depends on only temperature and composition via the extended Boussinesq approximation in the following form:\n\n\n\n\u03c1\ne\n\n=\n\n\u03c1\nm\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\n\nN\ni\ne\n\n\nN\n0\ne\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\n\u03c1\ni\n\n\n\nN\ni\ne\n\n\nN\n0\ne\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1\n\ni\n is the density of the non-mantle materials (depending only on composition) and \u03c1\n\nm\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c1\n0[1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b1(T\u00a0\u2212\u00a0T\n0)] is the mantle density, with reference density \u03c1\n\n0\n at reference temperature T0.\nWe assume a visco-plastic behavior for the lithosphere and a viscous behavior for the sub-lithosphere mantle.\nThe viscous behavior is accounted through an assumed reference viscosity \u03bc0 in the whole system, and the elemental effective viscosity is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\u03bc\neff\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\nviscous\n\n=\n\n\u03bc\n\n0\n,\ni\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\nE\ni\n\nR\n\n\n\n\n1\nT\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\nT\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere for each material i, \u03bc\n\n0,i\n is the reference viscosity at temperature T\n\n0\n and E\n\ni\n is the activation energy.\nIn order to limit the maximum effective viscosity and to minimize the hardening effects of temperature and strain, we introduce a cut-off value of 1025\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, in agreement with other authors (e.g., Gerya and Yuen, 2003, Marotta et al., 2009) (Fig. 2c). Neither stress hardening nor stress softening is considered. This simple rheological model is appropriate in reproducing the average continuum properties of a discontinuous medium and makes the analyses of gross mechanical behavior during the geodynamic evolution of the study area possible, allowing the formation of localized shear zones that can be interpreted as faults in continuum mechanics (see section 4.1).\nThe numerous models developed to analyze the dynamics of rifting (e.g., Huismans and Beaumont, 2002, 2003; Richter et al., 2021) show that a use of a more complex elasto-visco-plastic rheology affects mainly the initial stages of rifting, when the mode of small-scale localization of deformation structures is important for the successive breakup development. However, this is beyond the scope of the present study, in which we assume an a-priori weakness point where breakup will develop. In particular, we introduced a 10\u00a0km wide x 15\u00a0km deep weak zone in the center of the model, from surface downward (green area in Fig. 2, panel a), and characterized by a viscosities of 1019\u00a0Pa\u00b7s to localize the deformation and allow the development of the rifting since a continuous medium necessitates a heterogeneity in the mechanical properties as a seed for initiating the process of rifting (Huismans and Beaumont, 2003; Liao and Gerya, 2015; Wenker and Beaumont, 2018).\nWe account for the brittle behavior of the crust only to define the rheological condition for mantle serpentinization during continental rifting and the transition to oceanic spreading. Table 1\n lists the material and rheological parameters used in the analysis.\nIn agreement with studies on the lithospheric structure in the Gulf of Aden and its surroundings, four model sets have been developed changing the initial thickness of the continental crust (fixed at 35 and 40\u00a0km) and the initial thickness of the lithosphere (fixed at 150 and 200\u00a0km), in order to match the lower and upper bounds of the estimates of the present-day crustal and lithospheric thickness in the internal part of the Arabian plate suggested by integrated modeling of elevation, geoid data and thermal analysis (e.g. Hansen et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2010; Globig et al., 2016). We list the acronyms and setup of the models in Fig. 2d where HL stands for lithospheric thickness and HC stands for crustal thickness.\nTo allow for topographic variations, a 10\u00a0km-thick layer of sticky air is present above the crust, characterized by a viscosity of 1020\u00a0Pa\u00b7s and a density of 1\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123 (e.g., Crameri et al., 2012; Marotta et al., 2020). Our topography is thus the surface defined through the envelope of the topmost markers.\nWe are aware that the limited height of the sticky air could affect to some extent the detailed estimate of the topography, that is not in any case the focus of the present work.\nBoundary conditions are fixed in terms of temperature and velocity. The temperature is fixed to 300\u00a0K at the top of the crust and through the air layer. A temperature of 1600\u00a0K is fixed at the bottom of the model; zero thermal flux occurs through the vertical sidewalls. The initial thermal configuration corresponds to a steady-state conductive thermal profile, from 300\u00a0K at the surface to 1600\u00a0K at the base of the lithosphere and considering a radiogenic heat production in the continental crust (Table 1); an initial uniform temperature of 1600\u00a0K is assumed through the sublithospheric mantle (Fig. 2b). The 1600\u00a0K isotherm defines the base of the thermal lithosphere throughout the evolution of the system.\nTo simulate the northeastward relative motion between the Arabian plate and the African (Nubian) and Somalian plates, we apply an extension rate of 11.5\u00a0mm\/yr on both sides of the domain, from depths of 0 to 100\u00a0km, resulting in symmetric passive rifting with a total extension rate of 23\u00a0mm\/yr that is compatible with the highest velocities suggested for the eastern part of the Gulf of Aden (ArRajehi et al., 2010; Reilinger et al., 2015). No-slip conditions are prescribed along the top and the bottom of the model domain. Along the vertical sides, from the base of the lithosphere (\u2212100\u00a0km) below, we fix to zero the vertical component of velocity and the horizontal gradient of the horizontal component of velocity, according to eq. 1 (Fig. 2a). We ran the simulation for 40\u00a0Ma to cover the entire time span (approximately 35\u201340\u00a0Ma) from the beginning of continental rifting to the present (Bosworth et al., 2005; Bellahsen et al., 2006; Leroy et al., 2012; Bosworth, 2015; Rasul et al., 2015; Brune and Autin, 2013). A constant time step of 50 kyr is used that always satisfies the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition.\n\n\n3.2\nMantle serpentinization and oceanization\nThe role of serpentinization of the lithospheric mantle during continental rifting and the transition to oceanic spreading have been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g., P\u00e9rez-Gussiny\u00e9 et al., 2006; Marotta et al., 2018). In the present work, we implement mantle serpentinization and the associated compositional and rheological changes following Marotta et al. (2018)\u2019s approach. At each time step, we check whether a) the pressure and the temperature of each mantle-type marker match the stability field of serpentine and b) the overlying crustal layer is under brittle conditions. For the latter, we use a simplified formulation of Byerlee's law criterion to compute the brittle strength:\n\n\u03c3\n\nBrittle\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0\u2219\u00a0y, where \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a016MPa km\n\u22121 and y is the depth, and the brittle strength is compared with the temperature- and pressure-based plastic strength:\n\n\nRegime\n=\nmin\n\n\n\u03c3\nBrittle\n\n\n\u03c3\nPlastic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our model partial melting of asthenospheric mantle allows the growth of the oceanic crust at the ridge, assuming an instantaneous transfer of mantle melt to shallow depths, as commonly implemented (e.g. Gerya, 2013; Nikolaeva et al., 2008; Gulcher et al., 2019). This is also in agreement with estimates of the magma ascent rate across the continental and oceanic crust (Clague, 1987; Turner et al., 2000).\nTo verify whether the predicted thermal state can result in partial melting of the mantle and the formation of oceanic crust, we estimate the melting percentage of lithospheric mantle following the melting model by Katz et al. (2003) at each time step, as discussed in Roda et al. (2018). Basuyau et al. (2010) have combined seismological data with existing gravity data in a joint inversion scheme to estimate both P wave velocity and density structure beneath the northeastern margin of the Gulf of Aden, reaching depths of 250\u00a0km with a spatial resolution of about 50\u00a0km. They discuss the presence of anomalous bodies in terms of interaction between mantle and crustal processes, rift evolution and margin\/ridge segmentation.\nThe analysis of joint inversion of gravity and teleseismic data shows evidence for partial melting (3\u20136%) at a depth of between 60 and 200\u00a0km beneath the northern margin in the Southern Oman area along the prolongation of the AFFZ and the SHFZ. In the partial melting implementation, we estimate the melting percentage of lithospheric mantle and we use the value of 3% of partial melting as the minimum value at which the oceanic crust begins to form. This value is also in agreement with melt extraction threshold by Nikolaeva et al. (2008). After the melt fraction reach the threshold the melt is extracted and it migrates instantaneously creating new oceanic crust (Gerya, 2013).\nSome authors (Nichols et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2015) have proposed that the percentage of water near an oceanic ridge tends to increase as the ridge approaches a plume. In proximity to plumes, mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) can have H2O percentages up to 0.03\u20130.1%, similar to those observed in oceanic island basalts (OIB) (Dixon et al., 2002; Hirschmann, 2006). This feature can also be observed in the central and eastern parts of the Gulf of Aden, where basalts show the geochemical signature of normal MORB (N-MORB) (Rooney et al., 2014; Shinjo et al., 2015) incorporating a component from a plume-associated source. Therefore, we considered the solidus of a wet lherzolite with a bulk of H2O between 0.05 and 0.1%. We calculate the areas where partial melting occurs at the post-processing stage and the rate of the partial melting is determined following Katz et al. (2003). Within this work, we refer to crustal breakup when the two continental crusts are compositionally separated, although crust can still deform, being still subjected to the shear stresses exerted by the underlying lithospheric mantle which has not yet broken. We assume that lithosphere breakup is instead achieved when the effective strain rate decreases below the threshold value of 10\u221216\u00a0s\u22121 through the whole crustal thickness. The analysis of variations with time in the horizontal velocity and in the strain rate at crustal levels will thus allow to identify the times when crustal and lithospheric breakup occur.\nThe domain between the thinned continental crust and the oceanic crust, composed of denuded mantle that has been serpentinized before the occurrence of the gabbros, will be henceforth referred to as the Ocean Continent Transition zone (OCT). The width changes of the OCT and of the oceanic lithosphere in the study domain will be estimated considering the structural configuration of the system at the time of partial melting and at the time when the two continents are separated by a distance of 350\u2013400\u00a0km (as observed in the Gulf of Aden).\n\n\n\n4\nModel results\n\n4.1\nThermomechanical evolution and deformation\nDuring the first few million years from the beginning of extension, for all models, the predicted velocity field is controlled mainly by the far-field traction that induces predominantly horizontal velocities throughout the lithosphere. During this stage, the intensity of upwelling mantle flow below the future ridge is lower than the far-field intensity (panels a2 and b2 of Figs. 3 to 6\n\n), especially for the colder and thus stiffer models HL200.HC35 (Fig. 5) and HL200.HC40 (Fig. 6). With the progression of the forced extension, all models undergo continuous warming that is localized around the position of the future ridge, as revealed by the rising of the 800\u00a0K and 1500\u00a0K isotherms (Figs. 3 to 6). Thermal thinning is accompanied by progressive crustal thinning, which results in crustal breakup over a period ranging from 6\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC35 to 20\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC40.\nThe analysis of variations with time in the horizontal velocity and in the strain rate at crustal levels allows us to identify the times when crustal breakup occurs. To aid this analysis, Fig. 7\n shows the horizontal crustal velocity, averaged over the crustal thickness, as a function of distance from the future ridge and at different times of evolution.\nFour main phases can be distinguished in the thermomechanical evolution of the crust. The first phase (phase I) lasts a few million years from the beginning of extension. During this phase, the horizontal crustal velocities predicted by all models slowly decrease from the external borders to approximately 100\u00a0km from the future ridge, while in the central part of the domain the velocities rapidly decrease to 0\u00a0mm\/yr (Figs. 3a2, 4a2, 5a2 and 6a2 and green area in Fig. 7). This velocity pattern induces low strain rates within the crust away from the ridge (ranging from 1 to 3 \u00b710\u221216\u00a0s\u22121), while the highest values of strain rate (higher than 10\u221214\u00a0s\u22121) characterize the surroundings of the future ridge (Figs. 3a1, 4a1, 5a1 and 6a1). This phase lasts 5.9\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC35 (Fig. 3c1), 2.9\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC40 (Fig. 4b1), 4.9\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC35 (Fig. 5b1) and 3.9\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC40 (Fig. 6b1), indicating a longer duration of phase I for thinnest crust and thinnest lithosphere.\nDuring the second phase (phase II), a significant change occurs in the horizontal crustal velocities, which linearly decrease in intensity from the borders to the future ridge (Fig. 7), resulting in more intense strain rates, higher than 10\u221215\u00a0s\u22121, throughout the crust. The duration of the second phase is different for the different models. It lasts approximately 17\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC40, 8.5\u00a0Ma for models HL200.HC35 and 9.5\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC40 (Figs. 4c, 5c and 6c, respectively), while the HL150.HC35 model does not show a phase II.\nThe crustal horizontal velocities remain stable until the end of phase II when continental crust breakup occurs. For all models, crustal breakup can be recognized in Fig. 7 by the interrupted dotted black line localized around the future ridge and the immediately preceding velocity profile (black thick solid line). Crustal breakup occurs between 5.9 and 6.4\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC35, between 19.9 and 20.4\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC40, and between 13.4 and 13.9\u00a0Ma for models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40. Crustal strain rates and horizontal velocity patterns at these two times are shown in Figs. 3c1\n\u2212d1, 4 c1\n\u2212d1, 5 c1\n\u2212d1 and 6 c1\n\u2212d1 for models HL150.HC35, HL150.HC40, HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40, respectively. The thermomechanical evolution of model HL150.HC35 is faster than those of the other models, and continental crustal breakup occurs at the end of phase I (black solid lines in Fig. 7a).\nAfter crustal breakup (beginning of phase III) the magnitude of the crustal horizontal velocity progressively increases in all models both in space (toward the passive margin) and in time with the progression of model evolution (panels d2 of Figs. 3-6). These changes are compatible with the variation in time of the oceanic spreading rate. Consequently, the effective strain rate decreases over time until the crust starts moving as a rigid block, with the same velocities as those imposed at the marginal sides of the model.\n\nFig. 7 shows that local horizontal contraction may occur at crustal level after crustal breakup, evident in terms of a value of the horizontal velocity that increases moving toward the axial zone. It could be correlated to the coeval intensification of the uprising mantle flow in the central part of the model, as evidenced by the arrows represented in Figs. 3-6. A deeper investigation would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis but it is out of the scope of the present paper.\nWe assume that phase III ends when the crustal horizontal velocities differ by less than 10% from the maximum value prescribed at the marginal sides of the model (i.e., they are greater than 10.35\u00a0mm\/year) and the effective strain rate is decreased anywhere well below 10\u221216\u00a0s\u22121, as shown in panels e Fig. 3 (HL150.HC35 model, at 9.4\u00a0Ma), 4 (HL150.HC40 model, at 26.4\u00a0Ma), 5 (HL200.HC35 model, at 27.4\u00a0Ma) and 6 (HL200.HC40 model, at 21.4\u00a0Ma). The sole exception occurs near the passive margin, where values of the effective strain rate higher than 10\u221215\u00a0s\u22121 are still induced at the Moho level by basal shear due to the rising mantle. Based on the definition given in Section 3, at the end of phase III lithospheric breakup is accomplished.\nFinally, the last phase (IV) is characterized by two sections of crust that move as rigid blocks, with a velocity that, within a tolerance of 10%, is equal to that prescribed at the marginal sides. During this phase the extension of the central part of the model domain is driven by the upwelling mantle flow only and is accommodated by seafloor spreading (panel f of Figs. 3-6). As mentioned in Section 1, continental extension in the Gulf of Aden culminated in crustal rupture at approximately 16\u00a0Ma, and the accretion of new oceanic lithosphere in the central portion of the study area led to the formation of a 300\u00a0km-wide ocean. Our results agree with the analysis of the dragged samples along the mid-ocean ridge axis, as stated in Leroy et al., 2010 and Gass, 1970.\nWe stop the simulations when the two continental blocks are 400\u00a0km apart, which occurs at 24.4\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC35, 40.4\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC40, 35.4\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC35 and 34.4\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC40 (Figs. 3f, 4f, 5f and 6f, respectively). The long simulation time span also allows us to simulate the formation of the OCT zone, if this should develop.\n\n\n4.2\nPartial melting and oceanization\nIn all models, mantle serpentinization occurs during the early stages of evolution at the base of the thinned continental crust whose thickness is lower than 10\u00a0km in agreement with P\u00e9rez-Gussiny\u00e9 and Reston (2001). In particular, 4.4\u00a0Ma after the beginning of forced extension, mantle serpentinization is observed below the ridge axis in models HL150.HC35 (Fig. 8a) and HL150.HC40 (Fig. 9b), at 5.4\u00a0Ma in model HL200.HC35 (Fig. 10a) and at 3.9\u00a0Ma in model HL200.HC40 (Fig. 11a). Mantle serpentinization causes a local decrease in the viscosity and consequently an increase in the local velocity.\nOur results on the depth of the serpentinized zone with a thinned continental crust in magma-poor rifted margins are consistent with Pinto et al. (2015) who, from field work, obtain for proximal rift domains the possibility of highly extended (thinned) continental crust, lower than 10\u00a0km, which agrees with our modeling approach that does not contain faults or structural discontinuities, (Figs. 8a, 9b, 10a, 11a).\nAs already stated in Section 2.2, we assume that the oceanic crust forms after the beginning of mantle partial melting. Considering wet peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.05%, pressure and temperature conditions at the base of the lithosphere are favorable for the formation of oceanic lithosphere after a relatively short time from crustal breakup for models HL150.HC35 (3\u00a0Ma, Fig. 8c) and HL150.HC40 (4\u00a0Ma, Fig. 9d). In contrast, for models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40, favorable pressure and temperature conditions are reached 10\u00a0Ma and 6.5\u00a0Ma after the occurrence of crustal breakup (Figs. 10d and 11d, respectively).\nConsidering wet peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.1%, in models HL150.HC35 and HL150.HC40, favorable pressure and temperature conditions are reached 2\u00a0Ma and 17\u00a0Ma before the occurrence of crustal breakup (Figs. 8a and 9a, respectively). Similarly, in models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40, the formation of oceanic crust still starts after crustal breakup, namely, 4.5 and 2.5\u00a0Ma (Figs. 10c and 11c, respectively).\nAs stated in Section 3, for the formation of the OCT, partial melting must occur after mantle serpentinization and our results show that this condition is satisfied in all models considering wet peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.05%. In this case, at the time when the two continents are separated by a distance of 400\u00a0km, the denuded serpentinized mantle covers an area of variable width, from approximately 30\u00a0km at both continental margins in model HL150.HC35 (light and medium green colour in Fig. 8f) to 50\u00a0km in model HL150.HC40 (Fig. 9f) and 70\u00a0km in model HL200.HC40 (Fig. 11f). In the HL200.HC35 model, the OCT zone lies below the oceanic crust; therefore, oceanization does not occur (Fig. 10f).\nConsidering peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.1%, the conditions for OCT formation are predicted only by models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40, and OCT domain widths ranging from 80\u00a0km to 60\u00a0km develop (light green in Figs. 10f and 11f, respectively). In the case of 0.1% hydrated peridotite, models HL150.HC35 and HL150.HC40 predict partial melting before crustal breakup, thus preventing the development of an OCT.\nOur model results indicate that partial melting can occur before breakup (panel a of Fig. 9), and the oceanic crust could underplate the lithosphere, in agreement with observation in continental rifts of the northernmost part of the Central Red Sea (Ligi et al., 2012).\n\nFig. 12\n synthesizes the main stages of the deformation history predicted by the implemented models in terms of the timing of crustal breakup, serpentinization and melting with respect to the four thermomechanical phases. Our results show that a thicker lithosphere makes less important the variation in crustal thickness on the breakup timing which in fact is the same for the two models characterized by a 200\u00a0km thick lithosphere. The reduction of lithospheric thickness allows to emphasizes the effect of crustal variation on the crustal break up timing which occurs earlier for a thinner crust.\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we simulate the transition from continental rifting to oceanic spreading in the Gulf of Aden by means of a 2D numerical model based on the results of geodynamic studies and integrated modeling of elevation, geoid data and thermal analysis. A prescribed velocity of 11.5\u00a0mm\/yr is applied at both sides of the domain to fit the present-day kinematics of the study area. Furthermore, we adopt initial thicknesses of 35 and 40\u00a0km for the continental crust and 150 and 200\u00a0km for the lithosphere.\nA main result is that the thermomechanical evolution of the system can be separated into four phases with various durations for the different models:\n\na)\nphase I is characterized by horizontal crustal velocities that slowly decrease from the boundary of the model to approximately 100\u00a0km from the ridge and by rapid decreases in velocities in the central portion of the domain; as a consequence, low strain rates characterize the crust away from the ridge, while very high strain rates characterize the surroundings of the future ridge, as also shown in the modeled strain rate pattern in Brune and Autin (2013), Brune (2014) and Schettino et al. (2019);\n\n\nb)\nphase II has a crust characterized by velocities that are almost constant in time but decrease linearly in space from the lateral sides to the future ridge. During this phase, the highest velocity gradients and strain rates are observed (e.g., Brune and Autin, 2013; Watremez et al., 2013; Brune, 2014;). Phase II ends when continental crustal breakup occurs after 19.9\u00a0Ma from the beginning of rifting in model HL150.HC40 and after 13.4\u00a0Ma in models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40. This phase is not recorded by model HL150.HC35, which exhibits crustal breakup after 5.9\u00a0Ma, i.e., at the end of phase I;\n\n\nc)\nphase III characterizes the post crustal breakup evolution in all models. During this phase, there are fast increases in both horizontal velocities in the crust and vertical velocities corresponding to the ridge. Compared to phase II, the lateral velocity gradients are less intense and even decrease over time, resulting in strain rates that are lower than those predicted for phase II. This phase lasts 3\u00a0Ma for model HL150.HC35, 6\u00a0Ma for models HL150.HC40, 13.5\u00a0Ma for model HL200.HC35 and 7.5\u00a0Ma for HL200.HC40. At the end of phase III, when the lithospheric breakup occurs, the horizontal velocities in the crustal blocks are constant, with values higher than 10\u00a0mm\/yr in all models, and strain rates are very low (well below 10\u221216\u00a0s\u22121) compared to those predicted during previous phases;\n\n\nd)\nphase IV is marked by two sections of crust that move as rigid blocks with a velocity that, within a tolerance of 10%, is equal to that prescribed at the marginal sides, comparable with the velocity trend shown in Marotta et al. (2018). This phase ends when the two continental blocks are 400\u00a0km apart, that is after 24.4, 40.4, 35.4 and 34.4\u00a0Ma from the beginning of evolution, for models HL150.HC35, HL150.HC40, HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe Gulf of Aden is characterized by different velocities of oceanic spreading, which increase from west to east. In particular, west of the SSFZ, where magnetic anomalies date the formation of the oceanic floor at 2\u20133\u00a0Ma (Bellahsen et al., 2003; Bellahsen et al., 2006; Fournier et al., 2010; Leroy et al., 2010; Bonatti et al., 2015), velocities are approximately 13\u00a0mm\/yr, while in the east, in proximity to the AFFZ, where magnetic anomalies date the formation of the oceanic floor at 16\u201317\u00a0Ma (Bellahsen et al., 2003; Bellahsen et al., 2006; Fournier et al., 2010; Leroy et al., 2010; Bonatti et al., 2015), velocities are approximately 20\u00a0mm\/yr. The variation velocities predicted near the passive margin at different times of the evolution may contribute to explain the different velocities observed in the Gulf of Aden along different transects characterized by different ages of spreading. In fact, models HL150.HC40, HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40 predict a total spreading rate of 12\u201313\u00a0mm\/yr 3\u00a0Ma after the breakup at approximately 100\u00a0km from the ridge, which is compatible with the velocity observed at present in proximity to the SSFZ; the sole exception occurs for model HL150.HC35. Furthermore, all models predict a total spreading rate of 21\u201322\u00a0mm\/yr 15\u201316\u00a0Ma after the breakup, at approximately 150\u00a0km from the ridge, as observed at present in proximity to the AFFZ.\nOur results show that mantle serpentinization does not depend strictly on the initial thickness of crust and lithosphere: for almost all models it starts at 4.4\u00a0Ma after the beginning of rifting and only in model HL200.HC35 serpentinization occurs one million years later. In contrast, the timing of mantle partial melting strongly depends on the thickness and thus on the initial thermal state of the lithosphere (Mckenzie and Bickle, 1988; Schmeling, 2000; Furlong and Chapman, 2013) (compare Figs. 8 and 9 and Figs. 10 and 11). In particular, considering wet peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.1%, partial melting occurs very early for models with thinner lithosphere (Figs. 8a and 9a, for models HL150.HC35 and HL150.HC40, respectively) and even before the occurrence of serpentinization when a thicker initial crust is considered (model HL150.HC40). This result is caused by the higher thermal conditions of thinner lithosphere (models HL150.HC35 and HL150.HC40) and, in the same way, by the thicker continental crust of model HL150.HC40, which generates higher temperatures at the Moho level due to the higher production of radiogenic energy. Since the initial thermal conditions of the thin models are not very different from those required for melting in 0.1% hydrated mantle, mantle melting occurs very quickly in these models. In contrast, in colder models, a long time is required to increase the thermal state to pressure\u2013temperature conditions that are suitable for mantle melting.\nWhen peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.05% is assumed, mantle partial melting needs a higher thermal state (temperatures approximately 100\u00a0\u00b0C higher than those required for hydrated mantle with 0.1% water content). Consequently, models take more time to reach melting for 0.05% hydrated mantle. For all models, melting of 0.05% hydrated mantle occurs after breakup and 4 to 5\u00a0Ma after melting of 0.1% hydrated mantle. The sole exception occurs for model HL150.HC40, which predicts melting of 0.05% hydrated mantle only 20\u00a0Ma later than that of wetter mantle. The highest temperatures and the lowest stiffness characterizing this model make the stress transmission less effective, and the localization of thinning that drives the local increase in temperature occurs very late.\nAs mentioned in Section 1, the Gulf of Aden is a juvenile ocean that began rifting during the late Eocene between 42 and 35\u00a0Ma (Watchorn et al., 1998; Basuyau et al., 2010; Leroy et al., 2010). Magnetic data indicate that the emplacement of the oceanic floor can be dated at 19.7\u00a0Ma in the easternmost part of the Sheba Ridge, at 17.6\u00a0Ma up to the AFFZ and at approximately 16\u00a0Ma between the AFFZ and the SSFZ (Bellahsen et al., 2003; Bellahsen et al., 2006; Fournier et al., 2010; Leroy et al., 2010; Bonatti et al., 2015). These results suggest a period of 20\u00a0Ma characterized by extensional tectonics before the occurrence of continental breakup, and subsequently an oceanic\/OCT domain forms, with width from approximately 350\u2013400\u00a0km in proximity to the Sheba Ridge, where the opening rate is 23\u00a0mm\/yr, to approximately 200\u00a0km near the SSFZ, where the opening rate is 16\u00a0mm\/yr.\nWest of the SSFZ (Fig. 1), which marks the limit of the Afar plume influence, the Gulf of Aden exhibits volcanic margins without the formation of an OCT; partial melting possibly occurs before crustal breakup, and oceanic crust is created as soon as the continental crust is broken apart by dikes (Watremez et al., 2013). East of the SSFZ, the Gulf is characterized by magma-poor rifted margins where partial melting occurs after crustal breakup, and a narrow OCT (15\u201350\u00a0km) forms between the last continental crust and the first oceanic crust (Bauer et al., 2000; Watremez et al., 2003), which presents strong along-margin variations with serpentinization and little volcanism (Watremez et al., 2013). In particular, in the eastern part, oceanic crust begins to form approximately 1\u00a0Ma after continental breakup, with the consequent formation of an approximately 25\u201340\u00a0km-wide OCT (Nonn et al., 2019).\nThe comparison between numerical models and the natural Gulf of Aden mainly focuses on the central sector of the Gulf between the SSFZ and the AFFZ, where the emplacement of the oceanic floor was a continuous process (Fournier et al., 2010). Therefore, considering an extensional period lasting 20\u00a0Ma before the breakup, the HL150.HC35 model is not compatible with the geodynamic reconstructions because of its early breakup, which is predicted to occur approximately 7\u00a0Ma after the beginning of forced extension (Fig. 7a). In addition, model HL150.HC35, when a percentage of H2O equal to 0.1% is accounted for in the mantle, predicts mantle serpentinization that is coeval with mantle partial melting, thus not satisfying the conditions for OCT formation (Fig. 8a). Similarly, models characterized by a 200\u00a0km-thick lithosphere predict breakup approximately 14\u00a0Ma after the start of rifting (Fig. 7c-d). Further, considering peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.05%, models HL200.HC35 and HL200.HC40 show delays between crustal breakup and mantle melting ranging from 6.5 to 10\u00a0Ma (Figs. 8d and 9d), with the development of an OCT larger than that observed in the Gulf of Aden.\nConsidering 0.05% hydrated mantle, model HL150.HC40 is the most appropriate to reproduce the geodynamic evolution of the study area; this model is also in agreement with crustal and lithospheric thicknesses based on geoid data and thermal analysis (Globig et al., 2016) that show a thinned continental crust (passive margin), an OCT zone and an oceanic lithosphere, which characterize the final structure of the system. In fact, model HL150.HC40 predicts the onset of mantle serpentinization under the continental crust before the occurrence of mantle partial melting (Fig. 9a), which occurs 4\u00a0Ma after crustal breakup. This sequence of events allows the formation of an approximately 40\u201350\u00a0km-wide OCT (Fig. 9f). In addition, the oceanic domain in this model reaches an extension of 350\u2013400\u00a0km by 37\u201340\u00a0Ma after the beginning of forced extension, in agreement with the ages of the first extensional structures observed in the area.\nThe westernmost part of the area, near the SSFZ, is characterized by a transition between magma-rich and magma-poor margins, moving from west to east (Fig. 1) and by the absence of an OCT. Therefore, models that predict dynamics compatible with the evolution of the margins of this area are models HL150.HC35 and HL150.HC40 with 0.1% hydrated mantle because mantle serpentinization occurs synchronously with mantle partial melting and the OCT does not form. However, model HL150.HC35 does not show a timing compatible with the geodynamic reconstruction of the area, as revealed previously. In addition, model HL150.HC40 fits the westernmost part of the area characterized by volcanic margins since melting occurs before continental breakup. Geochemical studies of MORB that incorporate a component from a plume-associated source suggest H2O concentrations in plume sources ranging from 0.03 to 0.1% (300\u20131000\u00a0ppm; Hirschmann, 2006), compatible with the peridotite water content used in our simulations.\nOur results show that model HL150.HC40 describes the evolution of the central sector of the Gulf of Aden well, and the variations in the features along the passive margins could be related to lateral variations in the amount of H2O in the mantle, which determine different times of mantle melting. In fact, melting in the case of 0.05% hydrated mantle leads to the formation of a magma-poor margin and a narrow OCT, while increasing the water content up to 0.1% causes melting to occur before continental breakup, with a consequent volcanic margin and the absence of an OCT. The increase in mantle water storage can be associated with the presence of the Afar plume in the westernmost portion of the Gulf of Aden; a similar situation is also observed in proximity to a mantle plume along the Reykjanes Ridge in the North Atlantic (Nichols et al., 2002).\nThe dependence of mantle hydration on mantle melting and of the timing of breakup on the thickness of the crust and lithosphere, allow us to further constrain the latter compared with previous analyses. In particular, our results define an upper bound for crustal thickness of 40\u00a0km, in agreement with the findings obtained from the integration of elevation and geoid data and thermal analysis of north Africa by Globig et al. (2016).\nOur results for model characterized by 150\u00a0km -thick lithosphere show melting production before continental breakup, in agreement with numerical models by P\u00e9rez-Gussiny\u00e9 et al. (2006) accounting for an extensional velocity of 1\u00a0cm\/yr.\n\n\n6\nConclusion\nWe developed 2D thermomechanical numerical models of passive rifting to investigate the evolution of the lithosphere in the Gulf of Aden. The models are founded on integrated modeling of elevation, geoid data and thermal analysis and account for the present-day kinematics observed between the Arabian plate and Africa (Nubia) and Somalia.\nFor the combination of parameters assumed in the present analysis, our results indicate that, in addition to support a deformation history that develops in 4 different phases, the timing of mantle serpentinization is not affected by the initial thermal configuration of the system, and mantle serpentinization starts a few million years (4\u20135\u00a0Ma) after the onset of rifting for all models, well before crustal breakup.\nFurthermore, our results show that the OCT always develops when the rifting to oceanization transition occurs in case of a thick lithosphere. In contrast, with a thin lithosphere, wet peridotite with a total amount of H2O equal to 0.05% is required to drive the development of an OCT zone. Model predictions, in terms of the times of different deformation phases and sizes of the oceanic domain and the OCT zone, are compared with information based on magnetic data analysis and on the observed distribution of volcanic margins in the region between the SSFZ and the AFFZ, where emplacement of the oceanic floor was a continuous process. Model results confirm that the model with an initial 150\u00a0km-thick lithosphere and a 40\u00a0km-thick crust is the most appropriate to reproduce the geodynamic evolution of the study area when 0.05% hydrated mantle is considered. This model is also in agreement with the crust and lithosphere thicknesses based on thermal analysis and geoid data, which imply that the central part of the Gulf of Aden started to rift at approximately 37\u201340\u00a0Ma in its easternmost sector and is characterized by the sequence of a thinned passive margin, an OCT zone and an oceanic domain.\nThe best-fit model predicts a 40\u201350\u00a0km-wide OCT zone and a 350\u2013400\u00a0km-wide oceanic domain in the eastern sector, while a 100\u00a0km-wide oceanic domain with no OCT zone is predicted in the western sector of the Gulf of Aden. The variations in features along the passive margins from west to east are ascribable to lateral variations in the amount of H2O in the mantle, which determines the different times of mantle melting. In particular, an increase from 0.05% to 0.1% hydrated mantle associated with the Afar plume might have preceded mantle melting and thus precluded the development of an OCT zone in the western sector of the Gulf of Aden. Our approach allows us to obtain a robust estimate of the crustal thickness of 40\u00a0km, thus definitively choosing the upper bound in previous estimates of this parameter for the crust surrounding the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\nCredit author statement\nAll the authors contributed equally to: Conceptualization, Writing the original draft, review and editing.\nArcangela Bollino, Anna Maria Marotta, Alessandro Regorda Contributed equally to: Methodology, Software, Validation and Visualization.\nAnna Maria Marotta supervised the research activities.\nRoberto Sabadini acquired the finantial support.\n\n","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nOne of the main goals of the active tectonics community is to better resolve the details of the earthquake cycle, which to first order comprises alternating phases of interseismic strain accumulation and coseismic strain release (e.g., Reid, 1910; McCalpin, 2009; Scholz, 2019). Respective studies aim, for example, to determine a fault's geologic slip-rate (variation) and investigate the recurrence of earthquakes that release interseismically accumulated strain, using the tools from paleoseismology and tectonic geomorphology (with augmenting insights from historical accounts of earthquake occurrence and instrumental recordings of the earthquake cycle, as provided by seismic and geodetic data). Paleoseismic studies typically analyze deformed stratigraphic units, exposed via trench excavations, to constrain the time and size of past earthquakes at a specific site along a fault (e.g., Sieh et al., 1989; Grant and Sieh, 1994; Weldon et al., 2004; Zielke and Strecker, 2009; Ak\u00e7iz et al., 2010; Scharer et al., 2014). Tectono-geomorphic studies, on the other hand, commonly analyze tectonically displaced or deformed landforms, such as alluvial fans, river terraces, or channel beds, to constrain a fault's slip-rate and its slip accumulation pattern along larger stretches of a fault (e.g., Wallace, 1968; Sieh, 1978; McCalpin, 2009; Zielke et al., 2010; Klinger et al., 2011). Utilizing these approaches, a set of end-member models for earthquake recurrence and along-fault slip accumulation was postulated (e.g., Shimazaki and Nakata, 1980; Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984; Youngs and Coppersmith, 1985; Sieh, 1996; Mouslopoulou et al., 2012) and finds application in seismic hazard assessment. Since then, numerous studies extended on this work and used fault slip and age data, spanning many different time scales (from a few thousands to millions of years), to produce fault growth and earthquake recurrence models that reconcile fault slip accumulation over a range of time scales (e.g., Friedrich et al., 2003; Nicol et al., 2005; Mouslopoulou et al., 2009; Carafa et al., 2022).\nWhile paleoseismic and tectono-geomorphic techniques dominate the tool set that is used to constrain the details of the earthquake cycle, other techniques exist. For example, measuring the concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides (CRNs) along the free face of bedrock fault scarps (for convenience, we will refer to \u201cfree faces of bedrock fault scarps\u201d as \u201cfault surfaces\u201d for the remainder of this text) may indicate the time and size of the scarp-forming earthquakes. So far, this approach has been mainly applied on limestone bedrock normal fault scarps, based on the observation that Ca produced 36Cl, an unstable cosmogenic nuclide, when exposed to cosmic radiation. The concentration of these CRNs is, among other factors, a function of exposure intensity and time (e.g., Dunai, 2010; Schimmelpfennig et al., 2009). Distinct changes in the 36Cl concentration along a fault surface's height may therefore indicate the occurrence of subsequent earthquakes (Fig. 1\n; e.g., Schlagenhauf et al., 2010; Benedetti et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2018; Tesson and Benedetti, 2019). Another relative dating technique that is aimed at identifying the number of paleoearthquakes on limestone fault surfaces is the rare earth element REE method. This method measures changes in the geochemistry across a fault surface (identifying the depletion and enrichment of certain elements due to fault surface exhumation and erosion; e.g., Manighetti et al., 2010; Mouslopoulou et al., 2011, 2014). Additional insight is provided by the Schmidt hammer method (Tye and Stahl, 2018; Stahl and Tye, 2020), revealing weathering contrasts in limestone fault scarps via its rebound values (R-values).\nIn the present study, we also aim to identify abrupt changes in fault surface exposure time and hence aim to identify the occurrence of past earthquakes (i.e., their slip increments) along bedrock fault scarps. The approach is motivated by qualitative field observations indicating that fault surface roughness (of exposed normal fault scarps) changes systematically with scarp height. For example, fault surfaces along the Mt. Vettore fault (central Italy) are rougher at higher portions of the fault scarp, relative to its lower portions (Fig. 1A). This fault ruptured most recently in 2016, exposing previously buried portions of the fault surface. Similar observations were made previously along this and other faults and were quantitatively documented, utilizing lidar or image-based approaches to measure a fault scarp's surface roughness (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Reicherter et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013; Bubeck et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Mechernich et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2020; Corradetti et al., 2021).\nA positive relationship between fault surface roughness and surface age is expected, considering that the fault surface is exposed to persistent physical and chemical weathering. The underlying assumption of our study is therefore that prolonged exposure to (subaerial) weathering processes increase the roughness of a fault surface (Fig. 1; e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Mechernich et al., 2018; Corradetti et al., 2021). Further, assuming that roughness is homogeneous across the fault surface, we assign individual step-like changes in fault plane roughness to discrete exposure events (e.g., Mechernich et al., 2018). These exposure events may be the result of non-tectonic processes (e.g., climate-controlled, or gravity-induced) or tectonic processes (e.g., earthquakes). Given the precedence provided by 2016 earthquakes along the Mt. Vettore fault (causing fault surface exposure), we focus on the latter scenario. That is, if an initially homogenously rough fault surface is getting exposed sequentially due to the occurrence of subsequent earthquakes, then we may find distinct changes in fault roughness perpendicular to the (paleo-) ground surface if a) a sufficient amount of time has passed between subsequent earthquakes to create measurable changes in fault surface roughness, and b) a sufficient amount of slip has occurred during individual earthquakes to produce consistent roughness values along continuous portions of the fault surface (Fig. 1). The assumption of initially homogenous roughness across the fault surface is supported for the Mt. Vettore site, where the newly-exposed fault surface (exposed by the 2016 earthquakes) is indeed homogenously rough, without apparent, systematic roughness changes. It is further supported by lithological observations, indicating that the exposed fault surface spans a micritic, compact, and homogeneous Jurassic limestone without observable varying lithologic character (e.g., Pierantoni et al., 2013). Similar observations are made for the Roccapreturo site, where Cretaceous limestone is exposed.\nBased on this understanding, we analyze the roughness of bedrock fault surfaces along the Monte Vettore fault and Roccapreturo fault (Fig. 2\n) to resolve the slip increments of past earthquakes (e.g., Wei et al., 2013; He et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2020). Both faults feature sites with well-developed limestone fault scarps \u2013some of which investigated previously, therefore providing a contextual framework for our own investigation (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Schlagenhauf, 2009; Falcucci et al., 2015; Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019; Corradetti et al., 2021; Goodall et al., 2021). The two faults are located in the central Apennines (Italy), a NW-trending, ~400\u00a0km long and\u00a0~\u00a0100\u00a0km wide mountain range that undergoes NE-SW extension at a rate of 3\u20134\u00a0mm\/yr (D'Agostino, 2014). Extension is accommodated by 10\u201330\u00a0km long normal faults (such as the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo faults), arranged in several sub-parallel, segmented fault systems that are located along the ridge belt (Galadini and Galli, 2000; Vai and Martini, 2013). This belt has hosted to many destructive earthquakes over the last millennium (Rovida et al., 2021). The most recent earthquake activity occurred in 2016, when 9 successive shocks (M5\u2013M6.5) ruptured several portions of a\u00a0~\u00a060\u00a0km long fault system in less than half a year (e.g., Perouse et al., 2018 and references therein). Prominent surface ruptures, with maximum throws of 80\u2013130\u00a0cm, were observed along the Mt. Vettore fault after the largest shock of the sequence (M6.5) occurred on 30th October 2016 (Civico et al., 2018). Our first study site is located on this fault, near a place called Scoglio del'Aquila, where the 2016 coseismic surface displacement reached its maximum and where the fault surface (i.e., bedrock fault scarp) is particularly well expressed (Fig. 2A). Paleoseismic studies at other locations along the Mt. Vettore fault system revealed that at least seven surface faulting events (including the most recent ones in 2016) occurred within the past 22 kyrs, with an average return period of 3.6\u20131.2 kyr (Galladini and Galli, 2003; Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019). To our knowledge, no incremental slip amount has been attributed to the individual earthquakes, preceding the most recent one(s).\nThe second study site is located along the Roccapreturo fault. This fault belongs to the Middle Aterno fault system, which is composed of several NW-SE trending, ~10\u201320\u00a0km long faults (Galadini and Galli, 2000). A range of morphological features (e.g., triangular facets, channel knickpoints, strong incision and alluvial fan development) along this fault segment indicate the fault's long-term (104\u2013105\u00a0yr) as well as recent (103\u2013104\u00a0yr) tectonic activity. The Quaternary activity of the Roccapreturo fault was shown also by Falcucci et al. (2015) who found early-Pleistocene continental deposits on both sides of the fault, being offset by ~270\u00a0m. Falcucci et al. (2015) further found paleoseismic evidence for at least two surface rupturing earthquakes since 7.5 kyrs ago, with an accumulated minimum offset of 1.8\u00a0m. Additionally, a CRN investigation by Goodall et al. (2021) suggested that the most recent earthquake occurred ~2.6 kyr ago. Following, we describe our data set and analysis approach before presenting our results.\n\n\n2\nMethodology\nTo quantitatively investigate roughness variations across a fault surface, we adopt the structure-from-motion approach (e.g., Triggs et al., 1999; Lowe, 2004; Brown and Lowe, 2005; Johnson et al., 2014; Corradetti et al., 2017), enabling us to generate very high-resolution surface models by combining a large number of photographs that image the area of interest from many different angles. In total, 271 photos were acquired in November 2016 for the Mt. Vettore site (imaging two separate parts, I and II, of this fault surface) and 213 photos were acquired in 2019 for the Roccapreturo site. Additionally, one portion of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (part I) was also photographed in September 2016 (in-between the August and October earthquakes, 104 photos) and in June 2018 (108 photos). The resulting point clouds, covering areas of different sizes, contain more than 37 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 11\/2016), 46 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part II, 11\/2016), 6 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 09\/2016), 8 million data points (Mt. Vettore, part I, 06\/2018), and 22 million data points (Roccapreturo, 2019). The Mt. Vettore data sets, acquired in September and November 2016, are publicly available in Perouse et al. (2018).\nWe rotate the point clouds into local coordinate systems where the x\u2212\/y\u2212\/z-axis correspond to the along-strike\u2212\/along-dip\u2212\/out-of-plane direction. Next, we linearly interpolate the rotated point clouds to a grid, providing a uniformly spaced data set. We follow Hu et al.'s (2003) suggestion regarding the recommended grid size s which is informed by the data set's average observation point density in the area of interest (observations n per area A) and calculated as s\u00a0=\u00a0sqrt(A\/n). For all data sets, we have observation point densities in exceedance of 80\u00a0cm\u22122, indicating a permissible grid size of ~1\u00a0mm (Fig. 3\n).\nTo measure changes in fault surface roughness, we define a circle that is moved across the fault surface in 0.5\u00a0cm steps in strike- and dip direction (Fig. 4A). We use circles of three different sizes (2, 4, and 6\u00a0cm diameter) to ensure measurements consistency. For each step that the circle is moved across the fault surface, we collect all data points that fall within the circle. Hence, the 2-cm circle contains ~300 data points while the 4-cm and 6-cm circles contain ~1200 and\u00a0~\u00a02800 data points respectively. Next, we perform a principal component analysis on this circular subset to remove linear trends from its topography. This step requires for the circle's dimension to be distinctly larger than the topographic signal of the circular subset, indicating the existence of a lower limit for the circle's dimension, relative to the surface's roughness. If this requirement is met, then the first and second principal components define two in-plane coordinate axes, while the third principal component, being perpendicular to the first two, defines the local, detrended topography z of the circular subset.\nWe measure the roughness within each circle by calculating roughness metrics from topography z. In correspondence to choosing different circle sizes, we use three different local roughness metrics (namely the L2-norm, L4-norm, and the peak-to-valley method;\nGadelmawla et al., 2002; Santos and J\u00falio, 2013) to ensure measurement consistency. The peak-to-valley P2V roughness metric measures the absolute height difference between the highest and lowest point (value of z) within the circular subset, normalized by the circle's diameter D (EQ1; e.g., Gadelmawla et al., 2002). The L2-norm refers to the common root-mean-square approach for roughness quantification (EQ2; e.g., Power and Tullis, 1991; Santos and J\u00falio, 2013). The L4-norm (EQ3) differs from the L2-norm only in the power that is used, making the L4-norm in principle more sensitive to outliers i.e., more sensitive to roughness variations (Menke, 2012).\n\n(1)\n\nP\n2\nV\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\nz\nmax\n\n\u2212\n\nz\nmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nL\n2\n\nnorm\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\nz\ni\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nL\n4\n\nn\no\nrm\n=\n\n1\nD\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nN\n\n\nz\ni\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nBy moving the circle across the fault surface in small steps (0.5\u00a0cm), we typically generate hundreds of roughness measurements for each profile height. Given our assumption that subaerial weathering processes gradually increase fault surface roughness over time, we group the roughness measurements by profile height and then take a low-number percentile to represent the minimum fault roughness at that height (Fig. 4). As a result, we obtain low-roughness vs. height profiles (e.g., 1st and 5th percentile of L4-norm, Fig. 4B), smoothed with a causal (down-dip looking) moving average filter of 10-cm window size. The smoothed roughness profiles are then normalized to range from 0 to 1, respectively representing its minimum and maximum values. In correspondence to approaches taken in CRN studies, we compute histograms from the smoothed and normalized roughness profiles (Fig. 4B, bar plot). Here, histogram peaks indicate profile sections that share the same roughness character while histogram valleys between them indicate profile sections where roughness changes abruptly. The profile heights at which roughness begins to deviate away from the histogram peaks in the up-dip direction constitute event horizons, separating portions of the profile that were exposed to subaerial weathering before and after an exposure event (i.e., surface-rupturing earthquake; Fig. 4B, dashed lines and arrows). To better resolve the event horizon heights, we stack all the roughness profiles we obtained for a given circle size (i.e., stacking normalized profiles from different percentile values and roughness metrics) and analyze them collectively, along with the corresponding stacked histogram. This further reduces the data set's noise and helps focusing on signals (e.g., event horizons) that are consistent throughout our observations.\nNot all parts of the imaged surface represent the initial bedrock fault scarp (i.e., slickensides) whose degradation by persistent, gradual weathering processes we aim to resolve. Our surface models may contain areas where snow or plants cover the fault surface or where rocks have been plucked and dislodged from it, removing the original slickensides (e.g., upper left part of Fig. 3A, top and bottom part of Fig. 3B). We exclude these non-representative areas from the roughness analysis by defining polygons that outline the data set sections that we analyze (see auxiliary online material, Fig. S1).\n\n\n3\nResults\nFollowing the outlined approach, we analyze how fault roughness (i.e., its low-percentile representation) changes as a function of profile height at the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo sites. In total, we analyzed 5 sections of the fault surface at the Mt. Vettore site and 1 section at the Roccapreturo site (Fig. S1). As noted before, three of the Mt. Vettore sections are spatially overlapping, capturing part I of the fault surface (Fig. 3A) at three different times (09\/2016, 11\/2016, and 06\/2018; our measurements on the 09\/2016 and 06\/2018 data sets may be found in the auxiliary online material; Fig. S2). The other sections are spatially separated, covering different parts of the fault surface as documented by the 11\/2016 data set. Unfortunately, we were not able to take multiple measurements for the Roccapreturo site, where only one fault surface model is available. For each analyzed fault surface section, we provide three subplots (respectively for a 2-, 4-, 6-cm circle size), each of them containing 15 roughness profiles and a stacked roughness histogram (1st to 5th percentile for 3 roughness metrics; Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). Profile lines are semi-transparent to emphasize where they share similar values and overlap.\nFor section 1 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface, we identified five histogram peaks and hence five exposure event horizons (Fig. 5A). Three of them, at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.7\u00a0m, and 1.5\u00a0m, are distinctly larger than the other two at 0.9\u00a0m and 1.1\u00a0m. The smaller size of the latter two histogram peaks (the one at 0.9\u00a0m being the smallest) is due to the short profile sections (~20\u00a0cm) that exhibit this roughness character, which makes them presumably less reliable. However, our analysis of section 1, based on the 09\/2016 and 08\/2018 data sets (Fig. S2), indicates consistency between measurements \u2013even the weakly developed histogram peaks at 0.9\u00a0m and 1.1\u00a0m are found in the 09\/2016 and 06\/018 data sets, albeit at slightly shifted heights of 1.0\u00a0m and 1.3\u00a0m and 0.9\u00a0m and 1.2\u00a0m respectively (Fig. 5A and S2). This slight shift in height is caused by differences in polygon outlines (Fig. S1), combined with the curviness of the event horizons which is well exemplified for the most recent earthquakes (e.g., Figs. 2A and 3A). Further note that the 09\/2016 data set (Fig. S2A) also revealed a histogram peak at 1.8\u00a0m, which is not fully resolved in Fig. 5A because of this profile's limited length. The identified event horizon heights, reported relative to height of the August 2016 event horizon, are listed in Table 1\n.\nFor section 2 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (Fig. 5B), we find four well developed histogram peaks, located at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.9\u00a0m, 1.2\u00a0m, and 1.7\u00a0m. The changes between profile sections with similar roughness character are overall sharp and discrete (i.e., step-like), especially for the smaller circle sizes (Fig. 5B, left and middle). Given the clear expression of the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 (i.e., its histogram peak), relative to the corresponding one in section 1 (Fig. 5A), leads us to suggests that they are not related to the same exposure event. Instead, we suggest that the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 correlates to the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 1 and further suggest that the 0.9\u00a0m event horizon in section 1 is not resolved in section 2 (otherwise, the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon from section 1 is not resolved here). Likewise, we suggest that the 1.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 2 correlates to the 1.5\u00a0m event horizon in section 1.\nFor section 3 of the Mt. Vettore fault surface (Fig. 5C), we find three well developed histogram peaks, located at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.8\u00a0m, and 1.3\u00a0m, separated by sharp and step-like changes in roughness. Note that this profile is ~0.5\u00a0m shorter than those of section 1 and 2, therefore not capturing the higher event horizon at 1.5\u00a0m (i.e., 1.7\u00a0m). Following the same approach as for section 2 (based on relative expression of the step-like change in roughness and size of the associated histogram peak), we suggest that the 0.8\u00a0m event horizon in section 3 correlates to the 0.7\u00a0m event horizon in section 1.\nOverall, we find that the event horizon heights for the Mt. Vettore site (Table 1) are markedly similar across the different roughness metrics, percentile values, circle sizes, and analyzed fault surface sections, attesting for the consistency of these measurements. Including the 2016 earthquake sequence, we identified 6 exposure event horizons, respectively at 0.0\u00a0m, 0.7\u00a0m, 0.9\u00a0m, 1.2\u00a0m, 1.6\u00a0m, and 1.8\u00a0m profile height (relative to the 08\/2016 event horizon height). Assuming that these event horizons represent individual earthquakes, the corresponding slip increments range from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.2\u00a0m (Table 1). That said, we want to note that a direct correlation between exposure events, as identified from distinct changes in roughness metric, and individual earthquakes is likely not permissible. Multiple surface rupturing earthquakes may contribute to a single exposure event if these earthquakes occurred shortly after one another, in which case it is better to attribute event horizons to phases of substantial fault activity (potentially encompassing multiple surface ruptures). We will address this point in more detail in the following section.\nWhile positioned along another fault, our findings for the Roccapreturo site are broadly consistent with our findings for Mt. Vettore site (Fig. 6): Fault roughness and its variability increases with profile height, exhibiting profile portions of similar roughness that are separated by sharp, step-like roughness changes. For the Roccapreturo site, we find 3 well developed histogram peaks (i.e., event horizons) at 4.2\u00a0m, 5.9\u00a0m, and 7.0\u00a0m as well as 1 weakly developed peak at 6.3\u00a0m. The latter peak is more apparent in the roughness profiles from which the histograms are derived \u2013the corresponding profile section being bracketed by sharp changes in roughness metric (Fig. 6). Overall, the identified histogram peaks are separated by distinct valleys in the roughness histogram, indicative of sharp, step-like changes in roughness metric when moving from one histogram peak to the next (i.e., moving from one exposure event to the next). Hence, we identified 4 exposure events for the Roccapreturo site with slip increments ranging from 0.4\u00a0m to 1.7\u00a0m (Table 2\n).\nConveniently, the Roccapreturo site was also the location of a CRN investigation that aimed to determine the exposure history of this fault scarp. This investigation identified event horizons at ~4.4\u00a0m and\u00a0~\u00a07.1\u00a0m, with corresponding ages of 2.9 kyrs and 4.5 kyrs (Schlagenhauf, 2009). Our roughness analysis is therefore able to recover these events (EQ1 and EQ4; Table 1; Fig. 6) and presumably able to resolve additional events that were not found in the CRN analysis (at 5.9\u00a0m and 6.3\u00a0m profile height), highlighting the added value that may come from the roughness analysis. Apparently, the fault surface roughened more quickly than cosmogenic radionuclides accumulated, therefore enabling to resolve smaller variations thereof. Because our methodology cannot constrain the timing of the identified paleoearthquakes, we are not able to directly compare (and calibrate) our findings with the paleoseismic study by Falcucci et al. (2015) or the CRN study by Goodall et al. (2021) that were also conducted along the Roccapreturo fault.\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\nOur investigation along the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo bedrock fault scarps indicates that fault surface roughness may change systematically along profile height, alternating between a) profile sections with similar roughness characteristics and b) approximately step-like changes in roughness over short profile sections. We suggest that these step-like roughness changes constitute event horizons, separating profile sections that were exposed to subaerial weathering processes for different time periods. In our analysis, we were able to identify 6 event horizons for the Mt. Vettore site and 4 event horizons for the Roccapreturo site, respectively spanning a total profile height of 3.2\u00a0m and 2.8\u00a0m (for the Mt. Vettore site, this includes the 2016 earthquakes). Intuitively, we may assume a direct correlation between these event horizons and individual earthquakes. However, this correlation may not be sensible. For example, for the Mt. Vettore site, we know that the ~1.4\u00a0m offset from 2016 (EQ1 in Table 1; Fig. 2A) contains the slip contribution of two successive events (August 2016 earthquake with ~0.2\u00a0m and October 2016 earthquake with ~1.2\u00a0m of slip at the site; Perouse et al., 2018). The slip amount of the August 2016 earthquake and importantly the time interval between these two earthquakes (~3\u00a0month) is small, prohibiting to distinguish these events through surface roughness analysis. Hence, the reported histogram peaks and event horizons should not be correlated to individual earthquakes but rather to phases of substantial fault activity, potentially spanning more than one surface-rupturing earthquake. The reported offset increments (Tables 1 and 2) therefore represent the total slip amount of these phases, potentially containing slip contributions from more than one earthquake (e.g., Grant-Ludwig et al., 2010) as is also inferred for the record obtained from the 36Cl exposure dating (Beck et al., 2018; Tesson and Benedetti, 2019).\nThis understanding raises the question how many earthquakes contributed to each offset identified increment (i.e., activity phase) and how variable their respective offsets may be. Unfortunately, we are not able to answer this question because we are lacking the necessary observational data (e.g., knowing the event horizon ages to correlated them with paleoseismic studies; e.g., Galli et al., 2019). That said, earthquake physics, rupture simulations, and observational constraints suggest that slip accumulation along faults is dominated by large, full-rupture earthquakes (e.g., Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984; Youngs and Coppersmith, 1985; Pacheco et al., 1992; Sieh, 1996; Manighetti et al., 2005; Zielke and Arrowsmith, 2008; Ak\u00e7iz et al., 2010; Schlagenhauf et al., 2011; Zielke et al., 2015). Hence, we can provide a lower-bound estimate for the number of earthquakes that contributed to fault scarp formation (i.e., the portions we analyzed here) while further assuming that other (non-tectonic) mechanisms that may expose a fault surface can be neglected (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2002; Wiatr et al., 2015; Mechernich et al., 2018). That is, the 3.2-m high scarp at the Mt. Vettore site was formed by at least 6 surface-rupturing earthquakes, with maximum offsets ranging from 0.2\u00a0m to 1.2\u00a0m. If these offsets are indeed due to the occurrence of a single earthquake, then the corresponding magnitudes would range from M6.1 to M6.7 (Manighetti et al., 2007; Thingbaijam et al., 2017) \u2013plausible values in comparison to the 2016 earthquake sequence. Likewise, if the offset increments at the Roccapreturo site (ranging from 0.4 to 1.7\u00a0m) are caused by the occurrence of single, full-rupture earthquakes, then the corresponding magnitudes would range from M6.3 to M6.8. Note that these magnitude estimates for the Mt. Vettore and Roccpreturo faults are consistent with rupture length to average slip scaling relationships, implying corresponding rupture lengths of 20 to 30\u00a0km \u2013comparable to the reported length of these faults systems (Manighetti et al., 2007; Thingbaijam et al., 2017).\nFurther, we might correlate the 6 event horizons that we identified for the Mt. Vettore scarp (spanning 3.2\u00a0m of fault scarp) with the 6 surface-rupturing earthquakes that occurred within the last 9 kyrs along the Mt. Vettore fault (Galli et al., 2019), implying a throw-rate of ~0.3\u00a0mm\/yr. This rate is consistent with the minimum rate of 0.26\u20130.38\u00a0mm\/yr as derived from a single splay fault of a wide zone of deformation (Galli et al., 2019; Cinti et al., 2019; Pucci et al., 2021). However, it is distinctly lower than the fault's long-term (upper Pleistocene) rate of 0.7\u20131.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Pizzi et al., 2002; Puliti et al., 2020), indicating that either a) the throw-rate slowed down over time, or b) the 3.2-m high scarp was not exhumed over the last 9 kyrs.\nThe Roccapreturo site gives us the opportunity to validate our analysis by comparing it to a previous CRN investigation along this scarp (Schlagenhauf, 2009). We were able to reproduce these earlier findings and further to identify additional surface-rupturing events, implying that fault roughness measurements, under the right conditions, may provide a higher resolution of bedrock scarp exposure events. It appears that fault roughness may change more quickly than CRN is accumulated on scarps, enabling the identification of additional exposure events. However, as noted before, one important missing aspect is determining the age of the identified exposure events. Incorporating CRN analysis along fault scarps to determine the exposure ages directly above the identified event horizons would improve our understanding, as was possible for the Roccapreturo site. Defining these ages directly from roughness measurements requires a) quantifying the relative importance of all physical and chemical weathering processes that are responsible for roughness modification, and b) determining their respective rates, along with the parameters that control them. While this endeavor is beyond the scope of the present study, we anticipate extending in this direction.\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn the present study, we analyze high-resolution surface models of exposed fault surfaces from two sites along two faults in central Italy to determine how fault roughness varies as function of profile height and if it can be used to resolve slip increments of successive earthquakes. In doing so, we can identify 6 and 4 event horizons, respectively, over a total height of 3.2\u00a0m and 2.8\u00a0m for the Mt. Vettore and Roccapreturo site. Assuming that the corresponding slip increments, ranging from 0.2 to 1.7\u00a0m, were caused by individual, consecutive, surface-rupturing earthquakes, suggests the repeated occurrence of M6.1\u2013M6.8 earthquakes on these faults.\nOur findings indicate that, under specific conditions, fault roughness measurements along exposed fault surface provide the means to identify event horizons of fault exposure, indicating distinct phases of fault activity. We suggest that a combination of surface roughness analysis, as we performed it here (to identify event horizons), and CRN analysis (to assign an age to these event horizons) may further improve our ability to resolve details of the earthquake cycle along bedrock fault scarps.\n\n\nData availability\nThe point cloud data for the Mt.

This rigid corner of the Adria block, comprising the Venetian-Friulian plain and the northern Adriatic Sea, represents the eastern foredeep and southeastern distal foreland of Alpine and Dinaric thrust-fold belts, respectively (inset - Fig. 1\n; e.g., Burrato et al., 2008; Galadini et al., 2005; Placer et al., 2010; Zanferrari et al., 2008).\nIn the frame of the Mediterranean geodynamic evolution, the Adria microplate has a prominent role due to its subduction to the E (Dinaric) and W (Apenninic) and northward indentation into the Alpine orogen (e.g., Handy et al., 2015; Schmid et al., 2004), that induce varying styles of crustal deformation along its margins. The ongoing NNW-ward Adria motion relative to Eurasia, up to 4\u00a0mm\/yr (Vrabec and Fodor, 2006; Weber et al., 2010), is accommodated by active compressive tectonics resulting in deformation of Pleistocene deposits and present-day seismicity at the frontal ramps of the Southern Alpine domain (Galadini et al., 2005; OGS, 2017; Patricelli and Poli, 2020; Poli et al., 2015; Rovida et al., 2020; Viscolani et al., 2020). The northernmost Dinaric fault system shows recent displacement along NW-SE striking structures (as Idrija and Ra\u0161a faults) reactivated in dextral transcurrent kinematics and responsible for historical and instrumental earthquakes (Fitzko et al., 2005; Vi\u010di\u010d et al., 2019). Neotectonic transcurrent and transpressional deformation is observed also within the Dinaric-Alpine foredeep in the easternmost Friulian plain (Accaino et al., 2019; Burrato et al., 2008).\nIt is well established that understanding the geodynamic evolution of tectonic plates and associated geohazards relies in the integration of studies examining both deep and shallow Earth's processes. Geophysical research on mantle (e.g., Guidarelli et al., 2017; Stip\u010devi\u010d et al., 2011) and crustal (e.g., Castellarin et al., 2006; TRANSALPWorking Group, 2002) structures contributed to improve the knowledge on the polyphasic architecture and deformation history of the region (e.g., Handy et al., 2015; Schmid et al., 2004). Although the surface expression of deformation gives insights into the mantle convection processes, reconstructing complex crustal geometries in highly deformed plate margins and subducting microplates, as for the Adria plate, remains a challenging task. A variety of different geological and geophysical data is required, and difficulties generally rely in their different time and space distribution and resolution, along with the feasibility of their combined analysis (e.g. Faccenna et al., 2014; Le Breton et al., 2017; Brancolini et al., 2019).\nIn the past decades, tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the upper crust in foreland domain has been mainly reconstructed through oil industry (ENI) wells and medium-deep penetration multichannel seismic (MCS) data, collected in the 1970s and 1980s in the Venetian-Friulian plain (e.g. Fantoni et al., 2002; Fantoni and Franciosi, 2010; Nicolich et al., 2004). Over the central part of the northern Adriatic, the deep crustal structure of the foreland domain was explored by the marine active seismic CROP95-M18 profile, recorded in 1995 (Finetti and Del Ben, 2005; Scrocca et al., 2003). The northeastern tip of Adria plate in submarine setting, namely the Gulf of Trieste (GT), has been only recently surveyed thanks to the collection of a dense network of medium-high resolution MCS reflection data by the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics \u2013 OGS (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2013; Zgur et al., 2010, 2013). This approach unlocked a window into the crustal deformation of the Adria basin close to the Dinaric-Alpine intersection, where the present-day structural style is mainly determined by the rheological contrast between the ductile Eocene turbiditic deposits of flysch and their rigid NE-ward flexured Cretaceous-Paleogene carbonate bedrock. The eastern sector of the gulf represents the footwall of the outermost front of the Dinarides orogen, that is the Karst Thrust extending along the eastern rocky coastal area (Fig. 1). The hanging-wall of the thrust is represented by the Classical Karst Plateau, rising some hundreds of meters above sea level on the adjacent eastern onland (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2013). While the geodynamic reconstruction of Adria microplate is beyond our aims, the availability of this latest seismic dataset in the GT offers today the novel and unique possibility to extract quantitative geophysical parameters and geometries of the buried Adria upper crustal structure in the proximity of a highly deformed collisional domain.\nWe perform advanced tomographic techniques, on MCS reflection profiles in the eastern GT, involving Traveltime Reflection Tomography (TRT) (B\u00f6hm et al., 1999, 2000; Vesnaver and B\u00f6hm, 2000) and Depth Seismic Imaging (DSI) (Yilmaz, 2001), to propose the first well-constrained 3D P-wave velocity-depth model of the External Dinarides foredeep.\nThe same methodologies have been successfully applied to determine accurate seismic velocities and reconstruct the structure at depth in presently active convergent plate margins over the world. Some examples concern the Nankai Trough where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate (Park et al., 2002), the frontal ramp of the Main Himalayan Thrust (Liu et al., 2020), the Kodiak fault zone of the Alaskan convergent plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates (Krabbenhoeft et al., 2021).\nOur aim is to estimate the seismic velocities of three main sedimentary units (Plio-Quaternary sediments, Eocene flysch and Cretaceous-Paleogene carbonates) and the reconstruction in depth of their top surfaces. Although the fault plane of the Kast Thrust is not imaged by data, the accurate reconstruction of the seismic velocity field in its footwall is crucial to quantify its significant vertical throw. This information can be extrapolated throughout the eastern Friulian plain, where industrial seismic data (e.g., Merlini et al., 2002; Nicolich et al., 2004) have lower resolution and spatial distribution, but where lithological and tectonic setting is analogous. This is represented by the Dinaric foredeep delimited to the E by the Panzano and Palmanova thrusts (Fig. 1), that are the Karst Thrust's northward external Dinaric frontal ramp prosecution, with NW-SE orientation and WSW-ENE lateral ramps and with the Palmanova Thrust recently reactivated by the Neoalpine orogeny phase (Merlini et al., 2002; Zanferrari et al., 2013). Neither historical nor instrumental seismological activity has been related to the Karst Thrust, but this is located in a tectonically active region (e.g., Meletti et al., 2021; Rebez et al., 2016; Santulin et al., 2017; Visini et al., 2021). Therefore, the outcomes of our analysis can provide valuable input for enhancing neotectonics research in a strongly urbanized and industrialized coast. The coast of the eastern gulf hosts tree major shipping harbors that, from N to S, are: Monfalcone (it serves also as high tonnage shipyard) Trieste and Koper. The Free Port of Trieste (e.g., Memorandum of London, 1954; Treaty of Osimo, 1975) is the main oil terminal in the Mediterranean. Both the Trieste and Koper harbors are international hubs for trade with central and eastern Europe and they represent major blue-economy infrastructures, being the first ports, in Italy and Slovenia respectively, for total cargo and rail traffic to major European destinations through the TEN-T Baltic-Adriatic and Mediterranean core network corridors (European Commission, 2021; Port Network Authority of the Eastern Adriatic Sea, 2021). Moreover, this study can give a contribution in understanding wide scale processes occurring in a complex tectonic and geodynamic patchwork, where Adria is currently sliding along inherited Dinaric lineaments and it is colliding against the Alps.\n\n\n2\nGeological background\nThe GT is located in the northeastern Adriatic Sea and it is bounded to the N by the eastern Friulian Plain (Italy), to the E by the Classical Karst Plateau and to the S by the Istria peninsula (Slovenia, Croatia). It represents the foredeep of the adjacent External Dinarides and the distal foreland of the Southeastern Alpine chain (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2013; Nicolich et al., 2004) merging to the north and NW-SE and E-W oriented, respectively (Fig. 1).\nDuring the Mesozoic, a rifting stage affected the Upper Triassic Dolomia Principale carbonate platform and allowed the aggradation of the Mesozoic-Paleogene Friuli-Dinaric Carbonate Platform (FDCP) (Cati et al., 1987; Fantoni et al., 2002). Onland investigation described the carbonate platform units outcropping on the Karst Plateau (see GEO-CGT, 2013; Jurkov\u0161ek et al., 2016 and refences therein) and buried under the Friulian Plain (Cati et al., 1987; Nicolich et al., 2004; Zanferrari et al., 1982, 2008, 2013).\nA major offshore geophysical investigation took place recently, with collection of a dense network of MCS reflection data by the R\/V OGS Explora (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b; Busetti et al., 2013; Zgur et al., 2010, 2013), (Fig. 1).\nMoreover, core drilling operations at geothermal sites (e.g., Della Vedova et al., 2014), seismological (e.g., OGS, 2017) and secular-term geodetic observations (e.g., Braitenberg et al., 2006) have been carried out over the last four decades.\nThese geophysical investigations evidenced the following main characteristics:\n\n1.\n\nPolyphase tectonics and sedimentation. Analysis of seismic data revealed polyphase tectonics of the area, since the Late Mesozoic (Busetti et al., 2013). The Late Cretaceous-Paleogene Dinaric compressional phase produced a complex fold-thrust system, NW-SE oriented. The related foredeep migrated progressively SW-ward, involving, in the final stage, the eastern part of the GT. Here, the carbonate platform was flexured E-ward and the turbiditic sediments of flysch filled the basin during Eocene (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2013). Two main steps of deposition can be distinguished. The first allowed thicker sequence of turbidities infill the depocenter, the second led to sedimentation of a thinner sealing package. The entire unit is W-ward pinching out on the peripheral bulge of the system (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b). The top of the Paleogene carbonates is intercepted by the Grado-1 and Grado-2 geothermal wells at a depth of 616.5 and 630.0\u00a0m, respectively, overlying the Cretaceous limestones occurring at a depth of 1006 and 1004\u00a0m. At the borehole sites, the thickness of the flysch is about 100\u00a0m (e.g., Della Vedova et al., 2014). The marine regression during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, allowed sub-aerial erosion to shape the top flysch in valleys and ridges (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b). In the gulf, sub-areal conditions lasted until the Plio-Quaternary, when marine and continental sediments covered progressively the Messinian unconformity from W to E, draping the easternmost part in the Middle Pleistocene (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b; Zecchin et al., 2022). The northern onshore area adjacent to the gulf (Friulian plain) is covered by continental and marine Plio-Quaternary deposits.\n\n\n2.\n\nTectonic asset - main faults. The most external expression of the External Dinarides is represented by the Karst Thrust, running sub-parallel and near to the Karst coastline. The thrust is limited to the north by the anti-Dinaric (NE-SW) trending left lateral transtensional Sistiana fault and continues towards NW as the Panzano Thrust, with a W-ward offset of about 1\u20132\u00a0km; while it continues SE-ward, in the Slovenian onshore, as the \u201c\u010crni Kal Thrust\u201d (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b; GEO-CGT, 2013; Placer et al., 2010). The Karst Thrust dislocates the carbonates and the flysch with a very important vertical throw. The footwall of the thrust lies in the eastern part of the gulf. The hanging-wall of the Karst Thrust is represented by the Classical Karst Plateau, rising some hundreds of meters above sea level and settled on a wide asymmetric anticline, with NW-SE axis, that brings the outcropping carbonates above the younger Eocene flysch (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b).\n\n\n3.\n\nNeotectonics. With Adria microplate moving NNW-ward, seismicity occurs in the southeastern Alps and External Dinarides domains (e.g., Meletti et al., 2021; OGS, 2017; Santulin et al., 2017; Visini et al., 2021). Recently, Vi\u010di\u010d et al. (2019) discovered swarms and swarm-like seismic sequences happening at depth between 8 and 16\u00a0km along the NW-SE oriented strike-slip Ra\u0161a Fault, that has a geomorphological expression on the Karst Plateau. Furthermore, secular-term geodetic observations of the Karst Plateau, over the last four decades, indicate a regional tilting NW-ward, that has a tectonic origin (Braitenberg et al., 2006). In the GT, neotectonics and reactivation of inherited faults, with dextral transcurrent activity, are suggested in the MCS data by evidence of fluids within the Plio-Quaternary sediments (Busetti et al., 2013; Giustiniani et al., 2022; Vesnaver et al., 2020, 2021a). Fluid migration is probably driven along fault planes towards the seabed, where fluids seepages in the water plumes, metric mud volcanoes and pockmarks occur, as evidenced by high resolution sub bottom profiler\/Chirp data (Gordini et al., 2004; Busetti et al., 2019; Vesnaver et al., 2021b). Moreover, geomorphological investigations along the coast highlight recent tectonic movements (Furlani et al., 2011). In particular, in the northeastern coast, the Authors report that the Post-Roman age tidal coastal notches carved in the limestones deepen NW-ward, with a steep downdrop from about 1.2 to 2.3\u20132.8\u00a0m north of the transtensive Sistiana Fault. The displacement possibly occurred in response to creeping, within a regional NW tilting, and it is probably still active today.\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nMultichannel seismic profiles\nThe analysis performed in this work involved an area of 154\u00a0km2, in the eastern GT (i.e., Dinaric foredeep) covered quite uniformly by 132\u00a0km of MCS profiles, belonging to the 2009 and 2013's R\/V OGS Explora surveys in the GT. The average spacing between lines is 1.5\u00a0km, while the nearest distance from the eastern and southern coast is about 1.7\u00a0km. The distance from the northwestern Friulian Plain coast is about 5\u00a0km (Fig. 1).\nThe 2009 survey collected MCS reflection profiles entirely in Italian waters (Busetti et al., 2010a, 2010b; Zgur et al., 2010).\nThe 2013 survey, carried out by OGS in collaboration with the University of Ljubljana and Harpha Sea d.o.o. of Koper (Slovenia), acquired MCS profiles that cover the southern part of the gulf, between Italian and Slovenian waters (Busetti et al., 2013; Zgur et al., 2013).\nDuring acquisition of both surveys, the roll-along method was employed. During the 2009 survey, a 600\u00a0m long (48 receiver groups) and 1200\u00a0m (96 receiver groups) streamer was used for the NW-SE and NE-SW trending profiles, respectively. The 1200\u00a0m long digital streamer, with 96 receiver groups, recorded all the 2013 lines. The data acquisition was targeted to recover information with a medium-high resolution (theoretical vertical resolution for shallow layers of about 5\u00a0m). Acquisition parameters are listed in Table 1\n.\nThe pre-stack data processing in time domain encompassed geometrization, quality control and trace editing, band pass filtering for low and high frequency noise, spherical divergence amplitude correction, predictive deconvolution for reverberation coherent noise removal. Subsequently, after the sorting from shot point (SP) to common depth point (CDP) gathers, the processing involved velocity analyses, normal-moveout correction and stretch mute, stack, post stack deconvolution for multiple removal, automatic gain control, time migration (Zgur et al., 2010, 2013).\n\n\n4\nMethods: traveltime reflection tomography and imaging in depth\nThe construction of a detailed and reliable seismic velocity field is crucial for an accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of geological elements and can also provide information on underground petrophysical properties.\nSeismic reflection tomography represents a versatile tool for the estimation of the interval velocity field and the depth of the interpreted horizons. Compared to the conventional velocity analysis, it allows a better resolution of vertical and lateral velocity variations, which are very important for the better definition of the correct geometries.\nIn this work we employed two methods to build the velocity-depth model: the Traveltime Reflection Tomography (TRT) and Depth Seismic Imaging (DSI) techniques.\nThe TRT method (B\u00f6hm et al., 1999, 2000; Vesnaver and B\u00f6hm, 2000) estimates the velocity field and reflector structure in sequence, from the shallower to the deeper horizon (layer stripping method) by using the following iterative inversion procedure (schematized in Fig. 2a):\n\n1\npicking of the traveltimes corresponding to the interpreted horizons for various source-receiver position;\n\n\n2\ndefinition of an initial model;\n\n\n3\nforward modeling in the initial model, to compute the travel times by performing a ray-tracing for each source-receiver couple. Calculation of the difference between the picked and the modeled travel-times;\n\n\n4\ntraveltime inversion, by which the velocity and horizon geometries are upgraded;\n\n\n5\nreturn to step 3 using the new model, until the difference between this model and the previous one is small enough.\n\n\n\nThe procedure starts with an initial model for the velocity field and interface structure, generally consisting of homogeneous layers and flat-parallel surfaces. The inversion procedure, performed by the CAT3D software (OGS, 2014), uses the observed travel-times to perform a minimum-time ray tracing. The path between each source and receiver couple is defined through an iterative process following the Fermat's principle (B\u00f6hm et al., 1999). The procedure continues for travel-time inversion, by applying the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) and computes the seismic velocity through an iterative process that minimizes the travel-time residuals (Stewart, 1991; Van der Sluis and Van der Vorst, 1987). Then, the depth and geometry of the new interfaces are estimated following the principle of minimum dispersion of the reflected\/refracted points (Carrion et al., 1993), where the travel-time residuals associated to each reflected\/refracted event is converted into depth by using the velocity field updated in the first step of any iteration.\nThe loop ends when the variations, of the resulting model with respect to that of the previous step, are sufficiently small. This occurs when the dispersion of the estimated reflection points reaches a minimum, so that the reconstructed interface geometry does not vary considerably anymore.\nThe reliability of the tomographic result can be evaluated by computing the time residuals, that represent the differences between the picked and the computed travel times (Zelt and Smith, 1992). Furthermore, another measure for the reliability of the tomographic inversion is the null space energy, based on the singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix (e.g. Vesnaver, 1994). This parameter not only depends on the number of rays crossing each pixel, but it is a measure of the linear dependence of the equations associated to the tomographic matrix, and therefore of the matrix rank.\nPre-stack data are generally characterized by seismic signal that is unfocused and exhibits low signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, the detection of primary events at far-offsets can be difficult and relies only on the first traces, especially when the depth of the target exceeds the streamer length adopted for the acquisition. This may result in a rough velocity filed detection and too high dispersion of the estimated depth interfaces. In these difficult cases, pre-stack depth migration is suitable as it focalizes the seismic energy along the reflector, enhancing the signal response and enabling for an easier identification of deeper structures or weak impedance contrasts (Yilmaz, 2001).\nTherefore, to further refine the obtained velocity model, we employed the DSI method consisting in an iterative imaging technique involving Pre-Stack Depth Migration (PSDM), residual move-out analysis and tomography (Fig. 2b), by using the Paradigm\u00ae GeoDepth\u00ae software. Residual move-out analysis uses semblance sections computed vertically or along interpreted horizons on Depth Migrated Gathers (DMG), to assess the remaining error in the velocity field (Fig. 2c). In other words, the degree of non-flatness of the reflection events on the DMG is a measurement of the error in the model (Yilmaz, 2001). Tomography is then performed to refine the velocity-depth model: following the grid- and\/or horizon-based approach, it uses residuals as input and attempts to find an alternative model which will minimize the errors in the velocity field and horizon depth to produce flatter gathers (Yilmaz, 2001). Then, the iterative flow proceeds with a new pre-stack depth migration, and it goes on until the residuals become sufficiently small, which means a model with a flat sequence of events (Fig. 2b). In this case, the velocity field is estimated with enough accuracy, allowing to obtain an optimally focused depth image. In our case, the initial model of the refining procedure is that obtained from the tomographic inversion computed by CAT3D software (OGS, 2014). At every iteration both velocity and reflector geometries are updated, until the two sets of parameters reach a good degree of stability and consistency. A new horizon interpretation can eventually be done by picking the migrated section at each iteration. Subsurface imaging is finally obtained by pre-stack depth migration, which uses the refined velocity field to convert the seismic data in an image of the subsurface. The more reliable is the velocity field, the more realistic will be the migrated image.\nThe time stacked and migrated profiles were also interpreted, by using the IHS Markit\u00ae Kingdom\u00ae software. The interpreted surfaces were then gridded in the three dimensions by a dedicated algorithm available in the CAT3D software (OGS, 2014).\nThe final 3D P-wave velocity-depth model of the eastern GT was built throughout a combination of the above described techniques. The detailed workflow steps and related results are described in the following Section 5.\n\n\n5\nResults\nThe aim of this study was the reconstruction in depth domain of main surfaces and sedimentary units characterizing the sedimentary sequence buried under the Gulf of Trieste, at the northeastern Adria-Eurasia collisional plate boundary. The assessment of their spatial variability and geometrical relationship was done through the integration of different geophysical methodologies (Section 4). The analysis was conducted on several available multichannel seismic reflection lines, located over an area of about 154\u00a0km2 in the eastern part of the Gulf of Trieste.\nStarting from the interpretation of the reflected events on time migrated profiles, it was constructed a time 3D time model for the seabed, inner flysch, top flysch, and top carbonates horizons (Section 5.1). Seismic data organized by common shot and offset gathers were also interpreted to obtain, through the TRT method, a reliable 3D P-wave velocity-depth model (A) for the seabed and the top flysch surfaces (Section 5.2).\nSince the top of the carbonate could not be picked continuously along the analyzed seismic data, a first 2D tomographic inversion for the top carbonates was performed by using the TRT method (Section 5.3) and the obtained velocity field was then refined by applying the DSI procedure (Section 5.4). This allowed to resolve and image the deeper part of the top carbonates in the eastern study area. Further information came from the refracted event related to the top of the flysch (Section 5.5).\nFinally, a 3D P-wave velocity-depth model (B) was constructed by gathering all the information obtained (Section 5.6). The final model bears information about seismic velocities of seawater, Quaternary sediments, upper and lower Eocene flysch, upper Mesozoic-Paleogene Friuli-Dinaric Carbonate Platform together with the depth and geometry of these geological units' top surfaces.\n\n5.1\nTraveltimes interpretation and 3D time model\nPoint 1. of the TRT method consisted in picking the reflected P-wave arrival times related to the seabed and to the top flysch, on pre-stack seismic data sorted by common SP gathers (Fig. 3\n). The shot gather picking interval represents the number of shot gathers between those gathers on which traveltimes of the main events were observed and detected (picked). This interval was chosen according to the geological structural variabilities detected on common offset or stacked and migrated time sections. Generally, the picking interval was smaller in zones of higher lateral geological variability (e.g., picking interval every 5 shot gathers or less, in correspondence of a steep top carbonates horizon); whereas the interval was larger in correspondence of areas characterized by flat horizons and smoother structures. However, detection of the top carbonates hyperbolas was challenging on part of 2009 data, as the signal is covered by reverberations from shallow seabed (<20\u00a0m). The primary events of the top carbonates were detected with higher confidence in 2013 data, on short offsets (maximum 100\u00a0m, 4th trace) and at shallower depths than about 0.6\u00a0s two-way time (twt). The refracted P-waves arrivals from the top flysch, clearly aligned along a straight event, were also picked on raw pre-stack data. This allowed to directly calculate refraction velocities of the shallower part of the flysch unit (Fig. 4\n a,c,e). The resulting horizontal P-wave velocities vary from 3100 and 4200\u00a0m\/s, with an average value of about 3700\u00a0m\/s for the entire analyzed dataset. This will be used to obtain average reflection velocities presented in Section 5.5.\nThe seabed, top flysch and top carbonates, characterized by strong reflection coefficients, were interpreted on the time post-stack migrated data, together with an inner flysch horizon (Fig. 4 b,d). The latter has generally a relative higher amplitude response with respect to that characterizing the upper and lower flysch packages (here named upper and lower flysch, respectively). The resulting 3D time model is shown in Fig. 5\n. The irregular top flysch surface evidences a general deepening NW-ward and ranges between 0.15\u00a0s twt, in the southeastern sector, and 0.3\u00a0s twt in the opposite northwestern side. The inner flysch surface ranges between 0.2 and 0.4\u00a0s twt and it mimics the above lying top flysch, but it shows more pronounced irregularities. The top carbonates are flexured towards NE, deepening to 0.8\u00a0s twt in the easternmost part of the gulf.\n\n\n5.2\n3D P-wave velocity-depth model A\nThe first obtained 3D P-wave velocity-depth Model A (Fig. 6\n) is relative to the top of the flysch and its overburden. The TRT method was applied to invert the reflected traveltimes of the seabed and the top flysch. The initial 3D model was defined by a regular grid made up of 2 horizontal interfaces and 3 homogeneous layers (representing the velocity field). The initial average interval velocities, estimated from the stacking velocities were 1500, 2000, 2500\u00a0m\/s for water column, Quaternary sediments and upper flysch, respectively (Picotti et al., 2018). These values are typical velocities for the considered formations (e.g., Sch\u00f6n, 1996; Mavko et al., 2009). Each layer was discretized by a series of 14 voxels along the NW-SE axis and 11 voxels along the NE-SW axis.\nAfter having obtained the velocity of the seawater and the geometry of the seabed, the reflected traveltimes of the top flysch were inverted to define the velocity of the Quaternary sediments and update the top flysch surface geometry. For this latter, the inversion procedure was stopped after 80 iterations, with resulting mean acceptable traveltime residual of 1.5% and 0.003\u00a0s. The degree of dispersion of the estimated reflection points in depth, along the top flysch surface exhibits acceptable low values along all the profiles.\nThe resulting average P-wave velocity of the seawater and underlying layer are 1510\u00a0m\/s and 1700\u00a0m\/s, respectively. The estimated depths range is 22\u201325\u00a0m bsl for the seabed and 50\u2013220\u00a0m bsl for the top flysch. The former shows an almost flat surface, with highest depths located in the central part of the modeled area. The latter is characterized by irregular morphology, superimposed on a gradual deepening towards NW. The shallowest part of the surface is in the southeasternmost part of the model (along profile GT13\u201327), about 1.7\u00a0km offshore the Trieste coastline.\n\n\n5.3\n2D P-wave velocity-depth model of the GT13\u201327 profile\n\nFig. 7a shows the 2D result of TRT method applied to the eastern part of the GT13\u201327 (from km 10th to 21st). This is a key profile, as it is almost perpendicular to the northeastern coastline, ending just 1.7\u00a0km offshore the city of Trieste. It offers the opportunity to estimate maximum depth of the top carbonates in the footwall of the Karst Thrust. However, the crucial reflection is hardly visible, where it exceeds about 0.6\u00a0s twt, in both the analyzed raw pre-stack and stacked data in time domain (Figs. 3a and 7b).\nThe initial 2D model was constructed similarly to that of Model A, but with a two-dimensional grid (regular) having 3 interfaces and 4 layers. The initial P-wave velocity were (from top to bottom) 1500, 2000, 3500, 4000\u00a0m\/s. Each layer was discretized by a series of 30 pixels along the SW-NE axis.\nOnce reconstructed surfaces geometry (seabed, top flysch) and velocities of their overlaying layers, the reflected traveltimes of the top carbonates were inverted to detect the flysch unit velocity and to define the top carbonate depth.\n\nFig. 7c displays dispersion of the reflection points along the distance of the profile: at shallower depth of the top carbonates, time residuals (Fig. 7d) are acceptable for both short and long offsets (dispersion mean values of about 6\u00a0ms). This condition occurs in the southwestern part of the section, where the estimated surface lies between 500 and 800\u00a0m bsl. P-wave velocity values for the flysch unit here range between 2800 and 3750\u00a0m\/s. As the depth of the horizon increases (towards NE), the dispersion of reflected points (picked only up to the 4th trace) increases and the correspondent traveltime residuals reach peaks of 20\u00a0ms, indicating that results are not reliable.\n\n\n5.4\n2D Depth seismic imaging of the GT13\u201327 profile\nTo upgrade and refine the P-wave velocity field and geometry, for the different geological units, the DSI method was applied to the analyzed MCS profiles. Despite the typical low reflectivity of inner flysch beds, in this case the reflectivity at the top-mid flysch unit is high enough to apply the velocity refining procedure.\nThe final PSDM of the GT13\u201327 profile is shown in Fig. 8\n. Three iterations were needed to flatten the depth migrated gathers and therefore to obtain an optimal focused seismic imaging, also for the inner flysch beds.\nWell defined P-wave velocity vertical gradients are detected for main sedimentary units: 1600 to 2100\u00a0m\/s for the Quaternary sediments, 2900 to 4500\u00a0m\/s for the Eocene flysch unit, and 4600 to 5300\u00a0m\/s for the FDCP.\nConsidering the profile of Fig. 8a, the top FDCP dips gradually northeastward, with a mean real angle of 5\u00b0 along the profile direction (N60\u00b0E). The horizon reaches a maximum depth of 1600\u00a0m\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0m bsl, in the easternmost gulf. The error is estimated by considering an amplitude coherence of 70%, although seismic vertical theoretical resolution at that depth is about 30\u00a0m. The flysch unit shows maximum thickness of about 1500\u00a0m (top surface at 100\u00a0m bsl), that gradually decreases SW-ward. Erosive truncations are clearly visible at the top surface, that is overall depicted by irregular shape. At km 7 and depth of 200\u00a0m bsl, the flysch closes against the top of the carbonates and has sub-verticalized layers concordant with the top carbonates surface.\nAt 4.8\u00a0km depth, in correspondence of DMG 455, the average interval velocity reaches 4800\u00a0m\/s and a quite well focused reflection is highlighted (Fig. 8b).\nSeismically, it is characterized by a strong amplitude and reverse polarity. We exclude that this event can be associated to the multiple reflection of the top carbonates, because it occurs at a two-way time value (about 2\u00a0s twt) that is much larger than the double of that of the top carbonates (about 1.5\u00a0s twt, in correspondence of DMG 455 on the GT13\u201327 profile). Whereas, the reverse polarity is related to a velocity inversion. This is validated by the stratigraphy and sonic log of the Amanda 1bis well (Nicolich et al., 2004; ViDEPI-Project, 2009; Patricelli and Poli, 2020), located in the central part of the northern Adriatic, some tens of kilometers W from the presented GT13\u201327 profile and reaching 7305\u00a0m depth. The well crosses the basinal Meso-Cenozoic carbonate sequence (thus it does not intersect the FDCP carbonate units occurring in the GT). The sonic log carried out in this well shows a velocity drop of about 1000\u00a0m\/s at a depth of about 5300\u00a0m, according to the reversed polarity of the reflected event in our data. Although it is a well-known seismostratigraphic horizon extending through the north Adriatic and Venetian Friulian Plain (e.g., Nicolich et al., 2004; Zanferrari et al., 2008), this deep and strong reflected event is well detectable only in some local areas on the analyzed profiles. The seismic discontinuity is due to the fact that the event sits at a depth that is much larger than the maximum offset of the multichannel profile. This hampers the move-out sensitivity for the accurate reconstruction of the velocity field in the deeper formations. Moreover, the event occurs below an almost flat top carbonate surface (as in the correspondence of DMG 455 of the GT13\u201327 profile), in correspondence of which the incident rays are little deflected and the seismic energy is better focused. The same regards the seismic tomography which cannot estimate horizons at much higher depth with respect to the maximum offset. The velocity inversion is related to the change in the stratigraphic sequence: from the upper Triassic - Paleogene Carbonates to a 700\u00a0m thick upper Triassic package rocks of dolostones intercalated by pelitic layers locally rich in organic matter (Monticello Fromation), alternation of sands, marls and clays, evaporites (Trevenanzes Formation), dolostones (Dolomia Cassiana), hyaloclastites (Wengen Formation) and basic lavas (Vulcaniti), underlain in turn by a Permo - middle Triassic Carbonate sequence (Nicolich et al., 2004).\n\n\n5.5\n2D P-wave velocity-depth models from top flysch refraction\nThe horizontally varying velocity field of the upper flysch unit was estimated by refraction analysis (Fig. 4 a,c,e), described in Section 5.1.\nThe analysis, performed on all the seismic profiles, evidences a marked discrepancy between the average reflection (almost vertical) and refraction (almost horizontal) velocities at the upper flysch layer, which are about 2900\u00a0m\/s and 3700\u00a0m\/s, respectively.\nThis large discrepancy can be interpreted as a pronounced anisotropic effect, due to the laminated internal structure of the flysch unit. Most geological systems can be modeled as fine layering at seismic frequencies, which occurs when the dominant wavelength of the pulse is much larger than the thicknesses of the single layers. Picotti et al. (2018) validated the large discrepancy between the two tomographic velocity values by considering the flysch composed of a thin-layer periodic sequence of loose shale and cemented sandstone, and by applying the averaging theory by Backus (1962). Because of the inner flysch beds are almost horizontal, except for some locally tectonized sectors, the anisotropic model has a symmetry axis which is almost vertical, and the medium can be considered VTI (i.e., Vertical Transverse Isotropic; Picotti et al., 2018).\nIn other words, the difference between the average reflection and refraction velocities at the upper flysch layer, in the study area, can be interpreted as the anisotropic effect due to the laminated internal structure of the flysch unit.\n\n\n5.6\n3D P-wave velocity-depth model B\nThe final 3D P-wave velocity-depth Model B (Fig. 9\n) was built by combining the below listed outcomes:\na) average P-wave velocity of about 1510\u00a0m\/s and 1700\u00a0m\/s for the seawater and for the Quaternary sediments, respectively. Both belonging to Model A, obtained by the TRT technique, providing also the seabed and top flysch depth geometries;\nb) P-wave vertical velocity ranging between about 2800 and 3100\u00a0m\/s for the upper flysch unit, calculated from the horizontally varying refraction P-wave velocity by using the flysch anisotropic coefficients obtained by Picotti et al. (2018). These velocities are therefore used to convert into depth the inner flysch surface of 3D time model;\nc) average P-wave velocity of 4500\u00a0m\/s for the lower flysch unit, obtained from the DSI method performed on the GT13\u201327 profile. This average P-wave velocity is therefore used to convert into depth the top carbonates surface of the 3D time model.\nThe Model B shows the general NE-ward deepening of the top FDCP. Its depth ranges between 1450 and 1550\u00a0m bsl, along the northeastern side of the model, close to the coast. It gradually rises to 1000\u00a0m and 800\u00a0m in the northwestern and southwestern edges of the model, respectively. The surface shows a pattern of high and low morphologies, whose longitudinal axis is NW-SE oriented.\nThe top carbonates, interpreted along the PSDM GT13\u201327 profile, is shown within the Model B (yellow line in Fig. 9). There is a good degree of approximation (considering the large depth of this surface), except from some local discrepancies (up to \u00b190\u00a0m), as those in correspondence of the northeastern most part of the PSDM profile, where the local difference is about \u00b175\u00a0m. These differences are due to the fact that the 2D interval velocity model of the GT13\u201327 profile was refined using the iterative depth imaging procedure described in Section 4 and Fig. 2b.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nConsidering the resulting depth models, the thickness of the marine and continental Quaternary sediments, characterized by well-organized reflective packages, reaches a minimum in the eastern part, while they increase towards W-NW, in accordance with Busetti et al. (2010a, 2010b). Thickness values range from a minimum of about 50\u00a0m in the eastern part of gulf and a maximum of 190\u00a0m in the opposite side within the analyzed volume.\nThe DMG455 analyzed by the DSI procedure, together with the adjacent gathers within a 2\u00a0km segment of the PSDM section (Fig. 8b), shows a strong 4.8\u00a0km deep event, representing the base of the upper Triassic - Paleogene carbonate sequence (in the GT comprising the Dolomia Principale and the FDCP units, see also Section 5.4). It can be estimated that the thickness of the sequence, at least in the southeastern gulf, is around 3200\u20133400\u00a0m. This strong and deep event is a well-known seismostratigraphic horizon occurring at a basin-scale in the north Adriatic and Venetian Friulian Plain (e.g., Nicolich et al., 2004; Patricelli and Poli, 2020; Zanferrari et al., 2008). Since this reflection represents a seismically discontinuous horizon along the analyzed profiles, it could not be modeled and presented in the final 3D model. Therefore, the estimated thickness of the upper Triassic - Paleogene carbonate sequence represents a local value, but in agreement with the Amanda 1bis well stratigraphy. This event is locally evident also in other parts of the profiles and this demonstrates the good compromise between resolution and penetration provided by the analyzed MCS reflection lines.\n\nFig. 10\n integrates the results with the onland geology known from literature, combining different structural domains separated by the Karst Thrust (Dinaric foredeep to the W and External Dinarides to the E). The flysch reaches its maximum thickness of about 1500\u00a0m in the eastern side of the tomographic model, where it fills the Dinaric foredeep in the footwall of the thrust. The unit thins towards W where it is about 600\u00a0m thick. Further W, it pinches out on the top carbonate surface. The top flysch surface deepens from 50\u00a0m to 220\u00a0m depth bsl NW-ward. The depth imaging profile shows that the upper part of the flysch is characterized by internal layering that bends upwards from sub-horizontal to sub-vertical dip westward. This configuration can be interpreted as the effect of compressive deformation SW-ward verging, during the final stages of the Dinaric tectonic phase occurring in the Paleogene. The upper flysch unit results to be about 250\u00a0m thick. Its base is represented by the inner flysch surface that, with respect to the top flysch surface, is more uneven. This may reflect different intensities of tectonic deformation, as suggested by Busetti et al. (2010a, 2010b).\nThe top of the Meso-Cenozoic FDCP, buried in the gulf, deepens gradually towards NE and it is characterized by smooth ridges and valleys SW-NE elongated and few meters wide. The different style of deformation between the two units reflects their rheological contrast: ductile for the turbiditic flysch and rigid for the tilted carbonate bedrock.\nAt about 1.7\u00a0km from the Trieste coast, the top FDCP reaches a maximum depth of 1600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0m below sea level (bsl). The resulting depth in Model B fits, with a good degree of approximation, the depth revealed by the PSDM (maximum misfit: \u00b1 90\u00a0m). Local discrepancies (Fig. 9) are anyhow due to the interval velocity function, detected by the PSDM within the flysch unit, that is vertically and horizontally detailed with higher accuracy through DMG residual analysis, while in the 3D model the lower flysch unit has constant velocity. An example related to this difference can be seen near to the Trieste coast: here the top carbonates surface reaches a depth 1550\u00a0m bsl in the 3D surface of model B, while it is about 75\u00a0m deeper according to the PSDM result.\nIn the footwall of the Karst Thrust system, the depth of the top FDCP can be extrapolated, using the average inclination of 5\u00b0, down to 1740\u00a0m bsl in correspondence of the Trieste shoreline. The Karst Thrust system, NW-SE oriented and SW vergent, extends along the rocky coast and continues southeastward as the \u010crni Kal (in Istria) and northwestward as the Panzano Thrust (in the northern gulf and southeastern Friulian Plain). Moreover, at sea, the Sistiana left transtensive fault offsets the tectonic lineament few kilometers westward (Fig. 10a).\nAlong the shoreline and in the correspondent hinterland Karst Plateau, the Mesozoic-Paleogene lithostratigraphic units are structured in a Dinaric anticline (NW-SE axis) elevating between 0 and about 600\u00a0m asl on the eroded topographic surface (with a general lowering trend NW-wards). This represents the hanging-wall of the Karst Thrust, that brings the carbonate units above the younger Eocene flysch (structured, towards the coastline, in almost vertical dipping layers). The geological profile of Fig. 10d represents this structural setting. It was reconstructed along the SW-NE pre-stack depth migrated GT13\u201327 profile and its imaginary linear prosecution across the entire Karst Plateau up to the Vipava Fault. The onshore section is built by using jointly the geological maps published by GEO-CGT (2013) and Jurkov\u0161ek et al. (2016). The GEO-CGT (2013) covers the Classical Karst geology for the Italian territory, while the Slovenian part of the Karst is covered by the geological map by Jurkov\u0161ek et al. (2016). No wells are available in the area. Moreover, the depth extensions of the Diva\u010da, Toma\u010devica and Ra\u0161a faults are reported from analyses of the seismicity in the area by Guidarelli et al. (2017) and Vi\u010di\u010d et al. (2019). Despite the fault plane of the Karst Thrust is not imaged by seismic data, we can assume a geometry similar to the thrust system buried below the Friulian Plain and imaged by exploration seismic profiles (e.g., Merlini et al., 2002; Nicolich et al., 2004) and constituting the system to which the Karst Thrust belongs. Assuming the tectonic style of the buried thrusts, the Karst Thrust is considered to significantly displacing the FDCP. The top carbonate cut off at the hanging wall could be estimated to be around 100\u00a0m asl (Fig. 10d). Based on these evidences, the vertical throw, in correspondence of the coast, given by the Karst Thrust could be estimated in about 1800\u00a0m. Fig. 11\n shows the three-dimensional geological setting over the surrounding onshore of the gulf (from 3D depth model B), where the Karst highland and southeastern Friulian Plain (Digital Elevation Model by IRDAT, 2017) are represented together with outcropping faults and lithologies (from the geological maps by GEO-CGT, 2013; Jurkov\u0161ek et al., 2016). Whereas, in adjacent marine foredeep (eastern gulf), the top flysch and top FDCP depth surfaces are represented and gridded from the MCS pre-stack depth migrated profiles processed in this work. Fig. 11 is part of the 3D video multimedia uploaded as Supplementary data to this article.\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nThis study provides the first well-constrained 3D elastic P-wave velocity and depth model of the sedimentary sequence in the submarine Dinaric foredeep, adjacent to the northeastern collisional boundary between Adria and Eurasia. This was done by applying and integrating different advanced tomographic techniques on a recently acquired MCS reflection dataset, located over an area of 154\u00a0km2 in the eastern GT. The combined traveltime reflection tomography and depth seismic imaging procedures yielded detailed seismic velocities for the Quaternary sediments, Eocene turbiditic flysch and Meso-Cenozoic Friuli Dinaric Platform Carbonates. Therefore, depth and geometries of top flysch, inner flysch and top carbonates surfaces are quantitatively assessed in the foredeep of the External Dinarides. The resulting P-wave velocity field provides mean values of 1510\u00a0m\/s for the seawater, 1700\u00a0m\/s for the Quaternary sediments, 2900\u00a0m\/s for the upper flysch, 4500\u00a0m\/s for the lower flysch, 5000\u00a0m\/s for the carbonates. The outcomes reveal that the top of the Meso-Cenozoic carbonates is an inclined plane that reaches a maximum depth of 1600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0m bsl, about 1.7\u00a0km offshore the city of Trieste. If linearly extrapolated in correspondence to the shore, the horizon depth reaches about 1740\u00a0m bsl. Considering the Karst Plateau elevating up to 600\u00a0m asl, and the possible top carbonate cut off at the hanging wall at about 100\u00a0m asl, the Karst Thrust is responsible for a vertical throw of about 1800\u00a0m, in correspondence to the Trieste coast. Moreover, the 3D velocity-depth model and the depth imaging reveal that the maximum thickness of the flysch unit, filling the External Dinaric foredeep at the footwall of the Karst Thrust, is about 1500\u00a0m. The Gulf of Trieste is yet devoid of major known earthquakes in the historical and instrumental periods, but it is embedded over a deformed continental margin, where neotectonic activity is proven by a wealth of geophysical and geomorphic data and it is due to the active NNW-ward motion of Adria microplate. Therefore, these new quantitative outcomes offer enhanced constraints for neotectonic evaluation in this highly urbanized and industrial area. Resulting velocities of main units represent reference values for advanced seismic processing and data analysis to reconstruct buried geometries under the southeastern Friulian Plain, where geological setting is analogous, being the Panzano Thrust considered the northwestward continuation of the Karst Thrust. Moreover, the accurately reconstructed depth geometries of main sedimentary units, in the External Dinarides foredeep and Southeastern Alps foreland, provide new insights into the Adria lithospheric processes, that are prominent players within the Mediterranean geodynamics.\nThe following is the supplementary data related to this article.\n\n\nS1 Video. 3D Geological Model of the Gulf of Trieste (Dinaric foredeep) and Surrounding Onshore\n\nImage 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary material\n\nImage 2\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tecto.2022.229470.\n\n\nFunding\nThis research was the main subject of the first author's PhD course at the University of Trieste.

These phases are frictionally weak at subseismic slip rates compared to most types of minerals (Byerlee, 1978) and highly anisotropic in strength because of their layered mineral structures (Kronenberg et al., 1990; Mares and Kronenberg, 1993). The presence of weak, interconnected phyllosilicates is therefore proposed to be a major control on fault strength and strain localization, as well as slip behavior (e.g. Wintsch et al., 1995; Faulkner et al., 2003\n;\nJefferies et al., 2006\n;\nMoore and Rymer, 2007\n;\nCollettini et al., 2009). As such, understanding the rheological properties of phyllosilicates within fault zones, particularly at in situ pressures, temperatures, and rates of deformation, is important for modeling observed slip modes and improving seismic hazard assessment.\nExperimental measurements of the frictional constitutive properties of phyllosilicates at typical laboratory deformation rates (~0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) show that they typically strengthen with increasing velocity or strain rate, implying that weak faults dominated by phyllosilicates may accommodate aseismic slip (e.g., Scruggs and Tullis, 1998\n;\nSaffer and Marone, 2003\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). However, recent deformation experiments have shown that some phyllosilicate-rich fault samples exhibit rate-weakening behavior when sheared at low velocities characteristic of slow slip events (few to few tens of cm\/yr) (Ikari and Kopf, 2017\n;\nRabinowitz et al., 2018), challenging the conceptual framework that frictionally weak faults are stable. It is unclear, however, what microphysical processes cause this change in slip behavior at low deformation rates, and whether these mechanisms rely solely on the presence of specific phyllosilicates or additional minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar) within phyllosilicate-rich gouges (Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007\n;\nden Hartog and Spiers, 2013\n). Although the frictional properties of a wide variety of sheet silicates have been studied at hypocentral temperature and pressure conditions (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2011; Van Diggelen et al., 2010; Lu and He, 2014\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nTesei et al., 2018; Okamoto et al., 2019), fewer monomineralic phyllosilicate samples have been studied at the low shearing velocities representative of slowly creeping faults (e.g., Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nMoore et al., 1997\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998).\nAn important mineral that remains to be studied at slow in situ rates of deformation is chlorite. Previous studies indicate that chlorite may be a dominant control on fault deformation in many tectonic settings, including basalt-hosted segments of subduction megathrusts, oceanic detachment faults, retrograde faults exhuming mafic rocks, and the deep San Andreas Fault (MacLeod et al., 2002\n;\nSchleicher et al., 2012\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020\n;\nBraden and Behr, 2021). However, interpretations of its effect on fault zone rheology have been based on previous friction experiments performed using slip rates >0.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (Ikari et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2019), which show that chlorite has velocity-strengthening friction. As these frictional constitutive properties are largely empirical, it is difficult to reliably extrapolate them to lower rates of deformation.\nHere, we report results from triaxial shear experiments on chlorite gouge under hydrothermal conditions and slip rates from 0.001 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, spanning slow slip rates and the faster velocities previously used to study chlorite deformation. Experiments were conducted at constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures from 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures from ~25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. We determine how the strength, constitutive frictional properties, and microstructure of chlorite vary as a function of velocity, temperature, and effective pressure, finding new evidence that chlorite transitions to rate-neutral and -weakening behavior at low deformation rates. We then use our mechanical and microstructural results to interpret microphysical processes operating within water-saturated chlorite gouge which control transitions in its frictional behavior.\n\n\n2\nMethods\n\n2.1\nSample description\nWe measured the frictional strength of a fine-grained, chlorite schist that originated from the Michigamme Mine in Michigan, USA and was obtained from Ward's Natural Science. Experiments were conducted on disaggregated schist that was hand-ground with a mortar and pestle and sieved to particles <63\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. A hand magnet was used to remove most of the iron oxide minerals from the starting material.\nThe chemical composition of the sample was measured using a field emission electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) to collect quantitative wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and qualitative electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data. Data were collected at an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a working distance of 11\u00a0mm using a JEOL JXA 8530F Hyperprobe at Rice University. The WDS data were collected from 21 point measurements of chlorite grains at an accelerating voltage of 15.0\u00a0kV and current of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 A (Table S1). EDS measurements were used to identify the oxide phases.\nThe EPMA measurements of chlorite grains show that our sample has the chemical formula (Mg1.331Fe2+\n3.282Al1.329Na0.016Ti0.008Ca0.004)(Si2.665Al1.335)O10(OH,O)8 indicating it is close to chamosite, the Fe2+-rich endmember of the chlorite group. Oxide and phosphate phases were identified from EDS measurements as ilmenite and monazite. Quantitative area analysis of the back-scattered electron images of an experimentally deformed sample shows that it consists of >97% chlorite with minor amounts of ilmenite and monazite.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental setup and procedure\nWe measured the strength and constitutive properties of initially 5\u00a0mm-thick layers of disaggregated chlorite using the triaxial sawcut geometry (Fig. 1\n). Experiments were performed using a servo-controlled triaxial deformation apparatus at Rice University. The apparatus uses a hydraulic pressure system to control confining pressure, pore fluid pressure, and differential load. Confining pressure applies the least compressive stress (\u03c33) with silicon oil and pore fluid pressure (Pf) is applied with deionized water at one end of the sample. Confining and pore fluid pressures are measured with an accuracy of 0.01\u00a0MPa and LVDTs record displacements of the confining and pore pressure intensifier pistons. Differential load is measured with a temperature-compensated cell internal to the pressure vessel and converted to differential stress (\u03c3d) by dividing by cross-sectional area of cylindrical forcing blocks. Displacement of the axial piston is recorded with a linear voltage differential transformer (LVDT) external to the vessel and corrected for the elastic distortion of the apparatus using a calibrated stiffness of 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0N\/m. External heating bands heat the pressure vessel, and temperature is maintained to within 5\u00a0\u00b0C of the setpoint using a thermocouple located within the pressure vessel as feedback.\nSamples were deformed between cylindrical steel forcing blocks 25.4\u00a0mm in diameter with a sawcut surface 35o to the core axis (Fig. 1). The sawcut surfaces have triangular grooves spaced 1\u00a0mm apart to promote shear within the gouge layer, and a porous frit 1-mm thick and 13\u00a0mm in diameter sit in a recess of the sawcut surface to assist with the distribution of pore fluid at the gouge interface. To prepare each sample, we mixed 12.5\u00a0g of chlorite with distilled water to make a thick paste, which we spread in an even layer on one of the blocks using a loading jig and sandwiched carefully with the other block. The sample was then placed between a top and bottom platen and jacketed with three polyolefin sleeves. Once the sample was jacketed and placed in the pressure vessel, confining and pore fluid pressures were increased synchronously to compact the gouge layer yet maintain an effective stress (\u03c33\n\u2019\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c33 \u2013 Pf) less than the target experimental conditions. The experimental setup then equilibrated for 8 to 12\u00a0h while the vessel heated overnight, allowing additional time for compaction and for pore pressure to equilibrate across the gouge layer. We measured a thickness of 3.1\u00a0mm from a sample that was compacted at 70\u00a0MPa effective pressure but not sheared.\nWe conducted shear experiments at a constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures of 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures of 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Table 1\n). All deformation experiments were initiated with a sliding velocity of 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, except for one test (G0176) in which slip was initiated at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. After samples yielded and began to show linear strain hardening behavior (with one exception), we performed a series of rate steps at sliding velocities between 0.001 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, corresponding to shear strain rates of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0s\u22121, to determine the frictional constitutive properties (Dieterich, 1979). Rate steps were imposed every 0.5\u00a0mm of slip except during the slowest shear velocity which we held for 0.2 to 0.3\u00a0mm of slip. Most chlorite layers were continuously sheared up to 7.5\u00a0mm (shear strain of 2.5) which lasted a duration of four days, though in one experiment (G0012) the sample was unloaded after ~4\u00a0mm of slip and then reloaded. We conducted two experiments at 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure (G0019 and G0202) which exhibit different strain hardening trends than the other. In G0019 we imposed rate steps at the same strains as other experiments and in G0202 we imposed rate steps at higher shear displacements (4.8 to 10.3\u00a0mm) than other experiments. All data was recorded at a sampling rate of 0.2 to 1\u00a0Hz for shear velocities of 0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s and at 10\u00a0Hz for velocities of 0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s.\nWe used the measured differential stress, confining pressure, and pore fluid pressure to calculate the shear stress, \u03c4, and effective normal stress, \u03c3n\u2019, along the saw cut following standard procedures (e.g., Chester, 1994\n;\nTembe et al., 2010). We corrected our measurements of differential stress for the change in surface area along the saw cut with slip and the strength of our polyolefin jackets (Appendix A). We report the chlorite strength as the friction coefficient, \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c4\/\u03c3n\u2019, assuming zero cohesion consistent with previous studies on gouge friction (e.g., Chester and Higgs, 1992\n;\nMarone, 1998). We calculate the displacement along the sawcut from measurements of sample shortening. Volume change of the sample during shear was calculated by multiplying the displacement of the pore pressure intensifier piston by its cross-sectional area.\n\n\n2.3\nDetermining rate and state parameters\nWe use rate-and-state friction constitutive laws to evaluate the effects of slip rate and history on the frictional strength of chlorite (Dieterich, 1979\n;\nRuina, 1983). The common constitutive law for the friction coefficient (\u03bc) is\n\n(2)\n\n\n\u03bc\n\nV\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\no\n\n+\na\nln\n\n\nV\n\nV\no\n\n\n\n+\nb\nln\n\n\n\n\nV\no\n\n\u03b8\n\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bc\n\no\n is the steady state friction coefficient at a reference velocity V\n\no\n, D\n\nc\n is the critical slip distance required to renew a population of grain contacts, a and b are empirical material parameters indicating the direct and evolution effect, respectively, V is the sliding velocity, and \u03b8 is a time-dependent state variable that evolves according to either the aging law (Dieterich, 1979):\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor the slip law [Ruina, 1983]:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\nd\u03b8\ndt\n\n=\n\u2212\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\nln\n\n\n\nV\u03b8\n\nD\nc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor steady state slip (d\u03b8\/dt\u00a0=\u00a00), combining and simplifying these equations isolates the rate-dependence of steady-state friction, \u03bc\n\nss\n, coefficient as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\u03bc\nss\n\n\n\nd\nln\nV\n\n\n=\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive (a-b) values indicate rate-strengthening friction, which promotes stable sliding and fault creep. Negative (a-b) values indicate rate-weakening friction, which is required for the nucleation of unstable slip (e.g., Marone, 1998; Scholz, 2019).\nWe evaluated the rate and state frictional parameters, a, b, and D\n\nc\n from our data using an iterative least-squares inversion method (Reinen and Weeks, 1993) and the RSF3000 code developed by Skarbek and Savage (2019). Individual velocity steps were first linearly detrended using 300\u00a0\u03bcm of slip before each rate step, and data from each rate step was independently inverted across the window 300\u00a0\u03bcm before and after each step. The data was fit using one state variable and with both the aging (Dieterich) and slip (Ruina) laws. The two friction laws produce similar results (Table S2), and we plot frictional constitutive parameters in this paper using the aging law for comparison with previous experimental literature. Following suggestions by Skarbek and Savage (2019), we treated the sample stiffness as a fitting parameter.\n\n\n2.4\nTransient pore pressure effects\nOur ability to quantify the friction coefficient requires that the system is drained, meaning that the pore fluid pressure within the chlorite layer is equal to the pore pressure measured externally. At high shear velocities, pore fluids may become undrained if volume changes in the chlorite outpace the rate that fluids can diffuse into or out of the deforming layer. Following previous studies (e.g., Ikari et al., 2009\n;\nFaulkner et al., 2018; Xing et al., 2019) we calculate the time for pore fluid pressure in the gouge to re-equilibrate with the externally measured fluid pressure following a rate step. The characteristic diffusion time is:\n\n\nt\n=\n\n\n\nh\n2\n\n\u03b2\u03b7\n\n\n2\nk\n\n\n\n\nwhere h is the diffusion length (equal to a gouge thickness of 0.003\u00a0m), \u03b2 is the compressibility of the gouge (~10\u221210\u00a0Pa\u22121 following Faulkner et al. (2018)), \u03b7 is the viscosity of the fluid (0.001\u00a0Pa\u00a0s for water), and k is the permeability of the gouge (~10\u221220\u00a0s\u22121 following Morrow et al. (1984), Faulkner and Rutter (2003), Ikari et al. (2009)). Based on these parameters, we calculate that it takes 45\u00a0s for pore fluids to equilibrate after a rate step and conclude that deformation must occur over a significantly larger time scale to be considered drained. If we assume that determination of the steady-state friction coefficient requires fluid diffusion over an increment of 150\u00a0\u03bcm of slip (i.e., one half the displacement following a rate step we use to model frictional behavior), then the maximum slip rate that would allow pore fluid to drain is v\u00a0=\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcm\/45\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a03.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. This indicates that our fastest rate step (10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) is likely undrained. In addition, the parameters a, b, and D\n\nc\n are measured over different time scales, and even slower rate steps could result in undrained conditions over the time scales that these parameters are determined. We measure the individual time intervals over which a, b, and D\n\nc\n are determined from our data to constrain the slip rates for which these parameters are measured under drained conditions.\n\n\n2.5\nMicrostructural analyses\nWe study the microstructures developed in the chlorite using a combination of polarized light and back-scattered electron (BSE) microscopy. A JEOL JXA 8530F Hyperprobe at Rice University was used to collect BSE images, and this is the same instrument used to determine the chemical composition of the sample. Back-scattered electron images were collected at an accelerating voltage of 15\u00a0kV and a working distance of 11\u00a0mm.\n\n\n\n3\nResults\n\n3.1\nFrictional strength\nThe rheology of chlorite is frictional at the experimental conditions as shown by the strong dependence of its shear strength on effective pressure and weak dependence on deformation rate (Fig. 2a). Most of the samples exhibit non-linear strain hardening curves during the initial 2\u00a0mm of displacement and gradual near-linear strain hardening for the remainder of shear deformation. The exceptions are the two samples sheared at the lowest effective pressure (10\u00a0MPa; G0019 and G0202), which initially strengthen with increasing strain but then strain-weaken to a residual strength. Across all samples, friction coefficients range between 0.29 and 0.53 at 2\u00a0mm of shear displacement and 0.40 and 0.53 at 6\u00a0mm of displacement (Fig. 2b and c). At 6\u00a0mm displacement and 130\u00a0\u00b0C, the friction coefficient is similar (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.44 and 0.46) for samples sheared at effective pressures of 120 and 70\u00a0MPa corresponding to 10\u00a0MPa and 60\u00a0MPa pore fluid pressure, respectively, but is higher (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.5) at the lowest effective pressure of 10\u00a0MPa corresponding to 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure. At constant effective pressure of 120\u00a0MPa, the frictional strength of the chlorite increases with increasing temperature from \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.40 at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) to \u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.46 at 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\n3.2\nVolume change\nThe chlorite samples compact during shear until 3 to 4\u00a0mm of displacement, after which they deform at a relatively constant pore volume (Appendix B). Comparison of pore volume change as a function of displacement and time over the course of multiple rate steps shows that compaction is controlled by displacement and not deformation rate (Fig. B.1). As a result, at displacements <3 to 4\u00a0mm, there is an increased rate of compaction with time as velocity increases. We are only able to document these effects at velocities of 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. At lower velocities changing environmental factors in the laboratory (e.g., the room temperature) have a more pronounced effect on the pore pressure intensifier piston LVDT, which masks measurements of the small volume changes in the sample.\n\n\n3.3\nVelocity dependence of the frictional strength\nChlorite deformed at room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) shows a clear transition from rate-weakening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.004) at slow velocities (0.001\u20130.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) to rate-strengthening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.005) at fast velocities (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, at 70 and 130\u00a0\u00b0C and the same effective pressure (120\u00a0MPa) the frictional strength is near rate-neutral across the range of slip velocities tested (Fig. 4a and b), although at 130\u00a0\u00b0C the chlorite shows a trend consistent with a transition from slightly rate-weakening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.001) to slightly rate-strengthening (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.001) over a 4 orders of magnitude increase in velocity (Fig. 4a).\nAt 130\u00a0\u00b0C, the rate-dependence of the frictional strength is similar at 120\u00a0MPa and 70\u00a0MPa effective pressure, exhibiting a transition from slightly rate-weakening to slightly rate-strengthening with increasing slip rate (Fig. 4c). In contrast, at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure (Pf\u00a0=\u00a0120\u00a0MPa), the frictional behavior of chlorite shows much greater variability with respect to slip rate, shear displacement, and step direction which makes identifying clear trends challenging. Overall, at velocities <1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s the chlorite rate-strengthens significantly (a-b\u00a0=\u00a00.008 to 0.016) when rate steps were imposed beyond ~5.5\u00a0mm of slip (G0202), but has rate-neutral strength when imposed at lower displacements (G0019). In addition, at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure chlorite generally rate-weakens between 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, as shown most prominently when the velocity is stepped down from 10 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (a-b\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.009 to \u22120.015). We infer though that the rate-weakening behavior at high velocities may result from transient fluid overpressure in the sample, based on our estimate that slip rates >3.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s result in undrained conditions and observations of compaction during those fast slip rates (Appendix B).\nThe parameters a and b vary with temperature and deformation rate (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). At room temperature, a increases with velocity, while at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C a trend is not as clear (Fig. 5a b). In addition, a increases with increasing temperature at slow velocities (0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) yet shows the reverse trend at faster velocities (0.10 to 10.0\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Fig. 6a and b). These trends indicate that the processes controlling the direct effect in chlorite are temperature- and time-sensitive. The parameter b shows more consistent behavior; across all velocities and in all experiments except at very high pore pressure, b decreases systematically with increasing velocity such that at the fastest velocity (10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) b becomes very low or zero (b\u00a0=\u00a00 to 0.002) (Fig. 5c and d). However, b is generally less sensitive to temperature compared to a, as b only increases between 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C when the velocity is stepped down to 0.01 and 0.001\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (Fig. 6c and d). Values of Dc are more scattered but are greatest at room temperature and increase slightly with increasing velocity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C (Figs. 5e and f and 6e and f). The parameters a, b, and Dc do not show clear trends with increasing effective pressure during rate steps imposed at similar amounts of slip.\nWe determine the time scales over which a, b, and Dc are measured at different velocities to evaluate whether the reported values reflect deformation under drained conditions. We previously determined that at velocities up to 3.3\u00a0\u03bcm\/s steady-state strength is measured under drained conditions, and we conclude that b and Dc are also measured under drained conditions at these velocities. Specifically, the time interval over which b and D\n\nc\n are measured exceeds 45\u00a0s at velocities between 0.001 and 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, except when the sample is heated and sheared at 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. In contrast, the \u2018instantaneous\u2019 rate dependence (a) is measured over a much shorter time scale; approximately 1% (3\u00a0\u03bcm) of the slip following a rate step controls the inverse model result for a. Accordingly, deformation associated with the measurement of a only exceeds the equilibration time of 45\u00a0s at velocities up to 3\u00a0\u03bcm \/45\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, and rate steps between 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s provide measurements for a under undrained conditions. Our observations of compaction at these rates indicate that these steps may induce transient fluid overpressure, thereby decreasing the value of a (Faulkner et al., 2018). The values of a that we report at these rate steps are thus lower bounds, which we consider in our interpretations of the data.\n\n\n3.4\nMicrostructures\nAll deformed chlorite layers that were examined developed shear bands that define composite planar fabrics (Fig. 7\n). The shear bands are a few tens of microns wide and have R1- and Y-orientations following the terminology of Logan et al. (1979), although R1-shears are generally more common. Within shears grain size reduction has occurred, and both R1- and Y- shears contain strongly aligned grains of chlorite, as indicated by the uniform birefringence colors in cross-polarized light with and without the gypsum wedge inserted. The occurrence and distribution of these shears varies with the effective pressure and temperature of deformation.\nBoundary shears develop near the forcing block contacts at all conditions in the Y-orientation (Fig. 7). Y-shears also occur through the center of chlorite layers deformed at the highest effective stress, spanning nearly the entire length of the samples (G0110 and G0017), but not at the lowest effective stress (G0019). The R1 shears locally anastomose, split, and connect with adjacent R1- and Y-shears. The abundance of R1 shears varies strongly with effective pressure and temperature. Increasing effective pressure results in the formation of a greater abundance of R1 shears, as can be seen by comparing samples deformed at 130\u00a0\u00b0C and either 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure (G0019), which exhibits only a few thin shears spaced throughout the layer, or 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure (G0017), which exhibits a much greater abundance of shear bands (Fig. 7a and b). The abundance of R1 shears also increases with temperature. Among the samples deformed at 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure, a large number of distributed shears developed at 130\u00a0\u00b0C (G0017), whereas at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (G0110) deformation is concentrated more strongly within tabular zones of R1 shears (Fig. 7b\u2013e). The increase in R1 shear abundance with increasing temperature or pressure also correlates with higher shear strength. We also see fewer and more localized shears in chlorite deformed at higher velocities that correspond to rate-strengthening (G0155) behavior compared to lower velocities and rate-weakening (G0176) frictional behavior (Fig. 7d and e).\nAlthough deformation is predominantly accommodated along localized shears, the deformed samples also display more developed foliation with increasing effective pressure (Fig. 8a and b). The foliation is defined by elongated grains of chlorite and magnetite, which are inclined in the P-orientation 20-30o from the saw-cut angle in samples sheared at 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure. Individual grains of chlorite exhibit bending, kinking, and undulose extinction, which are crystal plastic deformation mechanisms (Fig. 8b and c). However, chlorite grains within the original undeformed schist also display these microstructures, so it is difficult to assess from our thin sections whether crystal plastic mechanisms operated during our deformation experiments.\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nFrictional strength\nWe document the frictional strength of Fe-rich chlorite gouge with shear displacement (shear strain), effective pressure, temperature, and sliding velocity. Shear displacement has a large influence on strength as most samples show significant strain hardening behavior (Fig. 2; Table 1). This behavior may occur because we use a relatively thick gouge layer (~3\u00a0mm after compaction), which could require high shear displacements to reach a shear strain required for steady-state frictional sliding. Shear experiments on initially 1\u00a0mm thick phyllosilicate gouge layers, by comparison, typically do not show as extensive strain hardening (e.g., Morrow et al., 2000\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2011). The strain hardening trends we observe during experiments at 70 and 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure may reflect continuous grain crushing during shear consistent with results from Haines et al. (2013) who showed similar strain hardening trends that correlated with evidence of significant grain size reduction in crushed chlorite schist, but steady-state frictional sliding in finer natural gouge chlorite (<2\u00a0\u03bcm) with minimal change in particle size distribution with increasing shear strain.\nEven with strain hardening, the range of friction coefficients that we report at room temperature and 70\u2013120\u00a0MPa effective pressure is generally comparable to the steady-state friction coefficients of 0.2 to 0.4 reported for saturated chlorite-rich gouges at room teimperature (Fagereng and Ikari, 2020; Behnsen and Faulkner, 2012\n;\nIkari et al., 2009\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2004\n;\nMorrow et al., 2000). Furthermore, our observation of a greater steady-state friction coefficient (\u03bc\u00a0=\u00a00.52) at 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure is consistent with studies showing higher friction coefficients at very low effective normal stress in clays and other sheet silicates due to non-negligible cohesion (e.g., Behnsen and Faulkner, 2012). Differences in the friction coefficients reported from different studies on chlorite may result from several factors including the presence of additional phases within samples, grain size distribution and geometry, different experimental conditions, the use of simulated gouge versus natural cataclasite or single crystal sheets (Smith et al., 2017\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019), and the chemical composition of chlorite (Moore and Lockner, 2015). Our measured friction coefficients for Fe-rich chlorite (chamosite) are slightly higher than the steady-state value of 0.38 measured for ripidolite, which has an intermediate Mg\/Fe ratio, at room temperature (Moore and Lockner, 2004). Clinochlore, which is the Mg-rich endmember of chlorite and forms a solid solution series with chamosite, has an even lower steady-state friction coefficient of 0.25 at room temperature (Okamoto et al., 2019). Our sample of chamosite contains 35\u00a0wt% FeO, compared to 5 wt% FeO in the clinochlore used by Okamoto et al. (2019). Our results therefore support the observation that increasing Fe content in chlorite promotes a slight increase in its frictional strength (Moore and Lockner, 2015). Additionally, the frictional strength of our chlorite gouge sample is greater than that of intact chlorite-rich cataclasite (Smith et al., 2017) and significantly higher than sheared stacks of single chlorite sheets (Okamoto et al., 2019). This is in agreement with previous studies that have demonstrated that samples with well-developed foliation or artificially aligned phyllosilicate sheets can be significantly weaker than powdered samples (e.g., Collettini et al., 2009\n;\nCarpenter et al., 2012\n;\nTesei et al., 2012\n;\nKawai et al., 2015\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019). Thus, the friction coefficients that we report on simulated chlorite gouge likely provide an upper bound for strongly aligned, interconnected networks of chlorite within natural faults.\nThe increase in chlorite frictional strength with temperature that we document has also been documented in illite and lizardite (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nden Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nKubo and Katayama, 2015), though lizardite has been shown to exhibit temperature-neutral friction as well (Tesei et al., 2018). In contrast, other sheet silicate-rich fault rocks including talc and smectite weaken with increasing temperature (Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). Some previous studies on phyllosilicate-rich fault gouges have attributed the strengthening effect of temperature to the thinning of water films adsorbed to mineral surfaces (e.g., Kubo and Katayama, 2015\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019) which can act as a lubricant during shear in water-saturated and room dry experiments (e.g., Moore and Lockner, 2004\n;\nBehnsen and Faulkner, 2012\n;\nS\u00e1nchez-Roa et al., 2017\n;\nBeynon and Faulkner, 2020). In accordance with site adsorption theory (Masel, 1996), an increase in temperature is expected to reduce the thickness of adsorbed water films and therefore increase the shear resistance between mineral surfaces (Israelachvili et al., 1988). In other cases, temperature-strengthening frictional behavior has been attributed to thermally activated mechanisms of the minerals, such as subcritical crack growth (Chester, 1994). However, when controlled by mineral deformation, strengthening is usually very small, on the order of the rate-dependence of strength, and best measured using temperature-stepping experiments (Chester, 1995). We measure a relatively strong effect of temperature (Fig. 3), and as a result we infer the temperature dependence of strength that we measure is likely controlled by the strength of water films.\nIn our study, higher temperature correlates with a clear increase in the number and density of shears that develop (Fig. 7), which also correlates with a corresponding increase in shear strength (Figs. 2a). Additionally, higher Riedel abundance and shear strength correlate with increasing effective pressure. We interpret that the greater abundance of shears at elevated temperature and pressure reflects the decrease in water film thickness (i.e., number of water monolayers) between aligned sheets of chlorite. If structured water films are initially thinner due to elevated temperature or pressure, then less slip is required to subsequently thin or squeeze them out between aligned plate surfaces. This would cause individual shears to strengthen more readily with slip, and in turn, distribute deformation to weaker layers in the gouge where more shear surfaces would develop. An increase in Riedel shear abundance with increasing temperature and strength has also been reported in illite-rich gouge when sheared from room temperature to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Kubo and Katayama, 2015). However, from 200 to 600\u00a0\u00b0C, the distribution of Riedel shears in illite generally remains constant with increasing temperature (Moore et al., 1989). Thus, the correlation we observe in our study between increasing temperature and Riedel shear abundance may only extend to low temperature ranges (<200\u00a0\u00b0C) in some phyllosilicates.\n\n\n4.2\nRate and state dependence of strength\nThe rate dependence of chlorite frictional strength (a-b) exhibits complex correlations with slip rate and temperature at the experimental conditions (Fig. 4a). The chlorite gouge rate-strengthens when sheared at fast slip rates (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), except during the tests at the lowest effective pressure (G0019 and G0202), during which it was likely that compaction produced fluid overpressure at fast velocity steps leading to apparent rate-weakening (Faulkner et al., 2018). This is consistent with earlier studies that have documented rate-strengthening behavior of chlorite over a similar range of velocities (Ikari et al., 2009; Haines et al., 2013\n;\nOkamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, at the lower sliding velocities (0.001\u20130.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) used in our study, chlorite exhibits predominantly rate-neutral or rate-weakening behavior, except when sheared under very high pore fluid pressure. The transition from negative to positive values of (a-b) with increasing velocity is sometimes referred to as the cutoff velocity (e.g., Shibazaki and Iio, 2003), and it occurs at ~1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s and is most dramatic at room temperature. The cutoff velocity of chlorite reflects different dependencies of the direct and evolution effects on velocity and temperature.\nThe contact-scale model of frictional deformation proposed by Chester (1994) predicts that rate-weakening friction occurs at the same conditions as temperature-strengthening friction and vice versa if the direct and evolution effects are governed by the same micromechanical process. This correlation between temperature and velocity-dependent frictional strength has been observed in studies on quartzofeldspathic and phyllosilicate-rich gouges (e.g., Chester, 1994; Blanpied et al., 1998; Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nden Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). However, in contrast to this model our results demonstrate that (1) chlorite rate-strengthens at the same velocities (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) at which its frictional strength increases with temperature and (2) the direct and evolution effects show different dependencies on slip rate and temperature. This implies that different contact-scale processes may be controlling the direct and evolution effects of friction at the conditions of our study.\nPrevious experimental data on phyllosilicates at low deformation rates show a correlation between the temperature dependent frictional strength and rate-dependence that is consistent with the Chester (1994) model. At room temperature and very low sliding velocities (~0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), water-saturated chrysotile, talc, and smectite gouges all show rate-strengthening behavior and weaken with increasing temperature between 25 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014). Thus, the frictional strength and rate-dependence of these phyllosilicates are thought to depend on mineral deformation at sliding velocities below 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. Antigorite, biotite, and muscovite similarly rate-strengthen at these low velocities (Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998). However, their frictional strength is insensitive to temperature between 25 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C (Takahashi et al., 2011\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nVan Diggelen et al., 2010), which suggests the Chester (1994) model may not describe the dominant physical properties of some phyllosilicates.\nIn contrast to the phyllosilicates discussed above, some lizardite and illite gouges have been reported to strengthen with increasing temperature above 25\u00a0\u00b0C (Moore et al., 1997\n;\nKubo and Katayama, 2015), yet the rate-dependencies of these minerals at low velocities are not well constrained. Moore et al. (1997) reported rate-weakening behavior of lizardite at velocities between ~0.03 and 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s but acknowledged a general lack of repeatability in their data. However, despite this gap in experimental data, previous studies indicate that illite-rich gouges are also rate-neutral or rate-weakening at low velocities, even at low temperatures (den Hartog et al., 2012\n;\nIkari and Kopf, 2017\n;\nRabinowitz et al., 2018). For example, den Hartog et al. (2012) showed that illite gouge transitions from rate-strengthening to rate-weakening at temperatures between 200 and 300\u00a0\u00b0C for sliding velocities between 1 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. They observed that the a-b values of illite systematically decrease with decreasing velocity, and thus proposed that extrapolating their a-b data to lower velocities would shift the rate-weakening behavior of illite to lower temperatures, consistent with our results on chlorite. Additionally, Rabinowitz et al. (2018) documented the effects of velocity and temperature on the frictional properties of carbonate- and clay-bearing sediment subducting at the Hikurangi Trench. They reported that its strength increases from 20 to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and found that the sediment transitioned to rate-weakening behavior at plate-rate velocities. Although clay minerals made up only ~20% of their sample, they interpreted that the clay fraction predominantly controlled the frictional strength and behavior. Thus, it is possible that the processes controlling the temperature and rate dependencies of strength in our chlorite sample are similar in other phyllosilicates such as illite.\n\n4.2.1\nMicromechanical controls on the direct effect\nAt low sliding velocities (0.001\u20130.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), the increase in a with increasing temperature is consistent with previous studies on several minerals including olivine, plagioclase, antigorite, biotite, and smectite that show a linear increase in a with increasing temperature (Fig. 6b) (King and Marone, 2012\n;\nHe et al., 2013\n;\nTakahashi et al., 2011\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nFrench et al., 2015). This behavior is commonly interpreted to reflect a thermally activated deformation mechanism that controls deformation at grain contacts (Chester, 1995\n;\nRice et al., 2001\n;\nNakatani, 2001\n;\nBeeler et al., 2007), such as dislocation glide in phyllosilicates (Beeler et al., 2007\n;\nLu and He, 2014\n;\nFrench et al., 2015). Tullis and Weeks (1987) and Beeler et al. (2007) developed a normalization scheme that relates the magnitude of a to the rate-dependence of the contact scale deformation mechanism given by a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a0Ac0\/\u03c40, where the subscript 0 refers to reference temperature and strain-rate conditions, a\n0 is the frictional rate dependence, \u03bc0 is the reference friction coefficient, A\nc0 is the rate-dependence of the contact scale deformation mechanism, and \u03c40 is the contact scale shear stress.\nWe evaluate whether our data for chlorite are consistent with previous analyses for phyllosilicates. For our chlorite sample, we approximate a\n0\u00a0=\u00a00.0045 and \u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.42 at 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 with a resulting ratio of a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.011. Although dislocation glide data for chlorite are not available, the normalized rate dependence for illite, biotite, and muscovite range between 0.014 and 0.018 when scaled to 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 (French et al., 2015). This is larger than the normalized rate-dependence of chlorite friction. For comparison, a\n0\/\u03bc0 of smectite gouge at velocities <10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (shear strain rates less than ~5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0s\u22121) is 0.017\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and inferred to reflect dislocation glide; however, at velocities >10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, a\n0\/\u03bc0\u00a0=\u00a00.009\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003 and is inferred to reflect subcritical delamination and fracture (French et al., 2015). By comparison, we infer that the similar normalized rate dependence over a similar range of velocities (> 10\u22125\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) is most consistent with the occurrence of the same mechanism, subcritical fracture and delamination, in chlorite as well, although this comparison does not rule out the operation of additional deformation mechanisms.\nMicrostructural evidence of grain size reduction is consistent with our inference that the instantaneous rate dependence (a) is controlled by subcritical fracture. Evidence of crystal plastic deformation of individual chlorite grains, including undulatory extinction, kinking, and twinning (Fig. 8), may have only been inherited from the original chlorite schist and may not have occurred during frictional shear. However, crystal plasticity could control the rate-dependence at lower velocities and higher temperatures as has been inferred in other phyllosilicates (e.g., Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998\n;\nBeeler et al., 2007\n;\nFrench et al., 2015).\nAt the faster velocity steps between 0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcm\/s, the decrease in a with increasing temperature is not consistent with any thermally activated deformation mechanism of the mineral, suggesting that other microphysical processes control the direct effect during these fast slip rates. We note that at similar velocities, the magnitude of a in montmorillonite increases with increasing hydration state while its coefficient of friction decreases (Ikari et al., 2007). For montmorillonite, this corresponds to both the number of water interlayers and the amount of water adsorbed onto crystal surfaces, though much of the water is adsorbed to surfaces of montmorillonite due to its high specific surface area (Newman, 1987; Moore and Lockner, 2007). Thus, although chlorite does not adsorb water molecules in its interlayer space (i.e. is a non-swelling clay), the removal of adsorbed water from chlorite surfaces may similarly decrease the direct effect with increasing temperature.\n\n\n4.2.2\nMicromechanical controls on the evolution effect\nIn contrast to the direct effect, the evolution effect does not demonstrate a clear dependence on temperature but is sensitive to deformation rate. The systematic decrease in the magnitude of b with increasing slip rate is the main driver of rate-weakening behavior at low velocities in our study. The b parameter is thought to reflect the evolution of grain contact area or strength through physical or chemical processes (Dieterich and Conrad, 1984). Studies of saturated clay-rich fault gouges, including illite, montmorillonite, talc, and chlorite, report negligible or negative b values with a-b\u00a0>\u00a00, indicating that the real area of mineral contact does not vary significantly with shearing velocity (Moore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). In experiments above 10\u00a0MPa effective pressure, we only observe near-zero values of b at the fastest velocity steps (Fig. 5c and d), which suggests that time-dependent processes controlling the evolution effect are important at low strain rates. Like our chlorite sample, biotite and muscovite gouges also exhibit b\u00a0>\u00a00 (e.g., den Hartog et al., 2013; Lu and He, 2014).\nSeveral deformation mechanisms have been proposed to explain the rate-weakening behavior of phyllosilicate-bearing fault rocks at either low slip rates or high temperatures. These include: (1) time-dependent removal of adsorbed water films (Scruggs, 1997), (2) time-dependent plastic deformation at grain-scale asperity contacts, which increase growth in real areas of contact (Dieterich, 1981\n;\nIkari and Kopf, 2017), (3) thermally-activated deformation of clasts (e.g., quartz and calcite) by pressure solution or stress corrosion cracking, with athermal granular flow of the gouge layer accompanied by dilation (Niemeijer and Spiers, 2007\n;\nden Hartog and Spiers, 2013\n;\nVerberne et al., 2020), (4) transient increases in pore fluid pressure due to increased compaction rates at higher velocities (e.g., Faulkner et al., 2018), and (5) shear-induced dehydration of phyllosilicate minerals in the gouge layer (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2011\n;\nOkazaki and Katayama, 2015\n;\nLecl\u00e8re et al., 2016). We conclude that velocity dependent water film thickness is most consistent with our data. Specifically, growth in the real area of asperity contacts due to plastic deformation should result in temperature-dependent values of b (e.g., Lu and He, 2014). However, this is not shown in our data, though we acknowledge that small temperature effects on b may be masked by the influence of strain-hardening. Furthermore, our sample contains >97% chlorite and we observe no microstructural evidence of pressure solution (Fig. 7). Transient increases in pore fluid pressure are also unlikely to influence the frictional behavior of our sample at low slip rates (<1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) where the highest values of b are measured. Finally, our experiments were conducted well below the thermal stability limit of chlorite (~650\u00a0\u00b0C), and we observe no evidence for the formation of dehydration products in our deformed samples.\nWe propose that the magnitude of b and its velocity dependence are controlled by the time-dependent removal of adsorbed water films from mineral surfaces (e.g., Scruggs, 1997). Likewise, Okamoto et al. (2019) suggested that the increase in steady state frictional strength of chlorite with temperature may result from the effect of adsorbed water films, which is also consistent with our observations. Adsorbed water coats grain surfaces and decreases the strength and\/or real area of their contacts. We propose that at lower sliding velocities, the average grain contact lifetime is longer, allowing for more time for water layers to squeeze out and cause strengthening. Thinner water layers at grain contacts may lead to higher strength for two reasons. First, the shear strength of structured water layers between grains increases with decreasing layer thickness (Israelachvili et al., 1988). In addition, thinner water layers may also result in a larger real area of contact between rough grain surfaces, thereby increasing frictional resistance at low sliding rates. As such, we infer that either or both these processes may control the negative rate dependence of b (Fig. 5) and overall rate-weakening behavior of chlorite at 70\u00a0MPa and 120\u00a0MPa effective pressure. However, conditions of high pore fluid pressure or low effective pressure may allow adsorbed water films to maintain their thickness (e.g., Van Diggelen et al., 2010\n;\nBehnsen and Faulkner, 2012), which would decrease the evolution effect. Our observation that chlorite exhibits large rate-strengthening and state-insensitive frictional behavior during slower rate steps (0.001 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) only at 120\u00a0MPa pore pressure (\u03c33\n\u2019\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0MPa) (Fig. 2c) seems to support this interpretation. Additionally, recent experiments using faster velocity steps (>0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) also showed that increasing pore fluid pressure promotes greater rate-strengthening behavior and near-zero or negative b values in phyllosilicate-rich gouges, even at constant effective pressure (Xing et al., 2019\n;\nBedford et al., 2021). However, we note from our high pore fluid pressure experiments (G0019 and G0202) that increasing shear strain and fabric development also influence the frictional behavior of chlorite. Therefore, further experimental studies are required to fully constrain the effects of fabric evolution and pore fluid pressure on the slip behavior of phyllosilicates at low velocities.\n\n\n\n4.3\nSynthesis\nAt relatively fast slip rates (>0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s), our measurements of chlorite constitutive properties, including its temperature-strengthening and velocity-strengthening frictional behavior, are consistent with results from previous experimental studies (Okamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020\n;\nIkari et al., 2009). However, we also observe that chlorite transitions to rate-neutral or -weakening behavior at slip rates below 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s. Based on microstructural and micromechanical analyses, we interpret that this transition in rate dependence is controlled by a competition between mineral deformation mechanisms at grain contacts (subcritical fracture and delamination), which increase a, and the time-dependent properties of water films bonded to contacts, which increase b.\nBy comparing the frictional properties of chlorite with other phyllosilicates, we find that at low velocities, the rate dependence and temperature dependence of strength are often inversely correlated. For instance, illite, which strengthens with increasing temperature from room temperature to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (Kubo and Katayama, 2015), is predicted to velocity-weaken at slip rates slower than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (den Hartog et al., 2012\n) similar to our results for chlorite at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Conversely, water-saturated phyllosilicates that show temperature-weakening or -neutral friction (e.g., antigorite, talc, smectite, muscovite, and biotite) all rate-strengthen at low velocities (~0.001 to 0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) (Reinen et al., 1992\n;\nMoore and Lockner, 2008\n;\nCoble et al., 2014\n;\nScruggs and Tullis, 1998). We hypothesize that phyllosilicates rate-weaken at low deformation rates when they are temperature-strengthening because both responses are controlled by physical changes of water films bonded to mineral surfaces. Although chlorite and possibly illite seem to be unique in promoting velocity-neutral or -weakening behavior of faults at shallow crustal levels corresponding to <200\u00a0\u00b0C, other phyllosilicates may transition to similar behavior at higher temperatures. For example, water-saturated biotite and muscovite transition to temperature-strengthening behavior above 100 to 200\u00a0\u00b0C, which may promote rate-weakening friction at low deformation rates, as has been documented at even higher velocities and temperatures (Lu and He, 2014\n;\nVan Diggelen et al., 2010). In contrast, both oven-dried and water-saturated talc continue to temperature-weaken and exhibit large rate-strengthening behavior at low deformation rates (0.01\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) from 100 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, which likely reflects its hydrophobic nature (Moore and Lockner, 2008). Lastly, chlorites tested by Moore and Lockner (2015) were reported to rate-strengthen at similar shearing rates (0.00115 to 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s) as our experiments and exhibit no clear temperature dependence of strength from 25 to 300\u00a0\u00b0C, which also supports the hypothesis that phyllosilicates rate-weaken at low velocities when they are temperature-strengthening. However, the discrepancy between chlorite constitutive behavior in our study and that reported by Moore and Lockner (2015) may imply that other factors besides temperature and shearing rate determine whether adsorbed water films affect the slip behavior of chlorite, such as pore fluid pressure or Fe content.\n\n\n4.4\nImplications for natural fault zones\nChlorite is frictionally weak (\u03bc\u00a0~\u00a00.4) under shallow hydrothermal conditions (Fig. 2), and faults containing chlorite may therefore accommodate slip under low shear stresses. This finding is consistent with field observations of chlorite-bearing fault zones in which deformation is localized into contiguous layers of chlorite-rich fault rock (e.g., Lacroix et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2020; Fagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, the increase in frictional strength of chlorite with increasing temperature indicates that fault zones enriched in chlorite may become stronger with increasing depth. This relationship may extend to depths corresponding to the thermal stability limit of chlorite, as the frictional strength of chlorite is shown to increase with temperature up to 600\u00a0\u00b0C (Okamoto et al., 2019). In addition, we observe that chamosite which is the Fe2+ endmember of chlorite displays higher values of friction than what has been reported for clinochlore, its Mg-rich counterpart (Okamoto et al., 2019). This comparison between the strengths of Fe- and Mg-rich chlorites is consistent with previous trends observed by Moore and Lockner (2015), indicating that faults enriched in Fe-rich chlorite may be stronger than faults filled with Mg-rich chlorite.\nThe constitutive behavior of chlorite has important implications for the stability of chlorite-rich fault zones. Based on previous laboratory measurements, chlorite has been interpreted to exhibit predominantly stable, rate-strengthening behavior across a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions, indicating that it will promote aseismic creep from shallow to deep segments of faults (Ikari et al., 2009; Okamoto et al., 2019\n;\nFagereng and Ikari, 2020). However, while we observe rate-strengthening behavior of chlorite at typical shearing velocities used in friction experiments (>10\u22126\u00a0m\/s), we observe that chlorite exhibits rate-neutral to rate-weakening behavior when sheared at slower natural rates of fault slip (10\u22129 to 10\u22127\u00a0m\/s) (Fig. 4a). This suggests that faults enriched in chlorite may be more easily destabilized than previously thought. Furthermore, this rate-weakening behavior of chlorite occurs within the characteristic slip rates of slow slip events (~10\u22128 to 10\u22127\u00a0m\/s). One of the proposed causes of slow slip is a transition between rate-strengthening and slightly rate-weakening behavior during frictional sliding (Rubin, 2008\n;\nLiu and Rice, 2009\n;\nSegall et al., 2010), and chlorite is a product of metasomatism at shallow and deep slow slip conditions (Phillips et al., 2020; Braden and Behr, 2021). Thus, faults enriched in chlorite may become marginally unstable at slow slip rates but stabilize at a cutoff velocity around 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s (as modelled by Kato (2003), Shibazaki and Iio (2003), and Liu and Rice (2009)). Although our study focuses on chlorite deformation at shallow depths within fault zones, chlorite may also play a significant role on slow slip within the deep tremor source of subduction zones, wherein chlorite is present and chlorite and lawsonite are predicted to dehydrate and generate high pore fluid pressures (French and Condit, 2019\n;\nCondit et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nChlorite is an important product of hydrothermal alteration within fault zones, including transform and subduction plate boundaries. However, it is poorly studied compared to other phyllosilicate minerals, particularly under elevated temperatures and at low sliding velocities. We present the results of triaxial shear experiments conducted at constant confining pressure of 130\u00a0MPa, pore fluid pressures from 10 to 120\u00a0MPa, and temperatures from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. We show that chlorite has a frictional strength that increases by \u0394\u03bc\u00a0~\u00a00.06 as temperature increases from 25 to 130\u00a0\u00b0C. At velocities less than 1\u00a0\u03bcm\/s the chlorite is rate-weakening and it transitions to rate-strengthening at higher velocities. Overall, the magnitude of the rate-dependence is greatest at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. These results indicate that seismic and slow slip may nucleate in chlorite-rich fault zones. We attribute the magnitude of the instantaneous rate dependence (a) to rate-strengthening mineral deformation and the magnitudes of the evolution effect (b) and the overall rate-dependence of the frictional strength (a-b) to the strength of water films between grains.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\nSupplementary Table S1\n\nPoint Measurements of Chlorite Grain Compositions a\n\n\nSupplementary Table S1\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary Table S2\n\nAging law and slip law fits for velocity steps during friction experiments\n\nSupplementary Table S2\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tecto.2022.229435.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nBenjamin D.

It is a seismically very active region where probably all types of earthquakes take place, including interplate megathrust earthquakes in the forearc under the Pacific Ocean, intra-slab and deep earthquakes within the subducting Pacific plate, outer-rise earthquakes east of the trench axis, crustal earthquakes in the overlying Okhotsk plate, repeating earthquakes, and low-frequency (slow) micro-earthquakes beneath active volcanoes and in the megathrust zone (e.g., Kanamori, 1971; Hasegawa et al., 2009; Nishikawa et al., 2019). In particular, the great 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) occurred in the megathrust zone, which generated great tsunamis and caused huge damage to the local society. Many strong aftershocks of the Tohoku-oki earthquake and related events have taken place in the past decade; the recent big ones are the Miyagi-oki megathrust earthquakes on 20 March 2021 (M6.9) and 1 May 2021 (M6.8), and the Fukushima-oki intra-slab earthquakes on 13 February 2021 (M7.3) and 16 March 2022 (M7.4).\nInvestigation of the three-dimensional (3-D) crustal and upper mantle structure is very important to clarify seismotectonics, volcanism and geodynamics of subduction zones. To date, many seismological studies have been made on the 3-D structure of the East Japan arc using various approaches (see Zhao, 2021 for a recent review). Although most of these studies focused on the crust and upper mantle beneath the land areas where dense seismograph networks (e.g., the High-Sensitivity Seismic Network, the so-called Hi-net) are installed, the 3-D structure of the forearc region under the Pacific Ocean has been also investigated, especially after the great 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Active-source seismic soundings have been made along some 2-D profiles in the forearc region (see Fig. 2\n and Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). Using the land-based network data of local suboceanic events relocated precisely using sP depth phases (e.g., Umino et al., 1995), many researchers have investigated 3-D variations of seismic velocity (e.g., Mishra et al., 2003; Wang and Zhao, 2005; Huang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011; Huang and Zhao, 2013; Liu and Zhao, 2018), seismic attenuation (e.g., Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017; Hua et al., 2019; Wang and Zhao, 2019) and seismic anisotropy (Liu et al., 2013; Niu et al., 2016; Liu and Zhao, 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Wang and Zhao, 2021) of the East Japan forearc, which have provided wealthy information on seismic structure and subduction dynamics of the forearc region. However, these tomographic results have lower resolution near the Kuril-Japan Trench axis.\nRecently, a permanent seafloor seismic network (S-net) consisting of 150 stations has been installed in the East Japan forearc and the outer-rise area under the Pacific Ocean (see the yellow squares in Fig. 1), which provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the detailed forearc structure and initial stage of plate subduction. Using P-wave arrival-time data of local suboceanic events recorded by the seafloor S-net, Yu and Zhao (2020) determined P-wave velocity (Vp) tomography off Hokkaido, Hua et al. (2020) obtained Vp tomography off Tohoku, and Wang et al. (2022) investigated 3-D Vp anisotropic structure off Tohoku. However, the 3-D S-wave velocity (Vs) structure of the forearc region has not been investigated using the S-net data, except for Matsubara et al. (2019). In this work, we use a large number of P and S wave arrival times of local earthquakes beneath the Pacific Ocean and land areas recorded by both the S-net and Hi-net to determine Vp and Vs tomography of the entire East Japan forearc (Fig. 1). Our results shed new light on the seismic structure and subduction dynamics of the forearc region.\n\n\n2\nData and method\nIn this work we used high-quality arrival-time data of local earthquakes recorded at 715 stations of the land-based Kiban seismic network and 150 S-net stations (Fig. 1). The Kiban network is composed of seismic stations of several permanent short-period seismic networks installed on the Japan Islands, including the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) Seismic Network, the Japan University Seismic Network, and the Hi-net (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17598\/NIED.0003;\nOkada et al., 2004). P and S wave arrival times of local earthquakes in and around the Japan Islands are measured from three-component seismograms recorded by the Kiban network and the S-net with an automatic processing system and monitored by the network staff daily. The picking accuracy of the arrival times is estimated to be 0.05-0.15 s for P-waves and 0.1-0.2 s for S-waves. The arrival-time data are used to determine hypocentral parameters (i.e., origin time, latitude, longitude and focal depth) for each local event. The resulting data base of P and S wave arrival times and hypocentral parameters is known as the JMA unified earthquake catalog (Okada et al., 2004; Tamaribuchi et al., 2021). The Kiban network data have been available since May 2002 (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17598\/NIED.0003), whereas the S-net data have become available to the public since September 2020 (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17598\/NIED.0007).\n\nFig. 3\n shows hypocentral distribution of local earthquakes used in the present study. These events consist of two groups. The first group contains events that occurred beneath the land area during 1 January 2019 to 31 August 2020 recorded by the Kiban seismic network. The second group contains events that took place mainly beneath the Pacific Ocean from 1 September to 15 December 2020 recorded by both the S-net and the Kiban network. The events in each group are selected from all the events in the study region during each period from the JMA unified earthquake catalog. For the event selection, the study region (Figs. 1 and 3) is divided into cubic blocks with a dimension of 10 km (latitude) x 10 km (longitude) x 5 km (depth). Among all the events in each block, only one event is selected that has the maximum number of P and S wave arrival times and the minimum error of the hypocentral parameters. In addition, each selected event was recorded at eight or more stations and its hypocentral uncertainty is smaller than 3 km. As a result, 12,716 events are selected that occurred in the crust and mantle wedge of the Okhotsk plate, the subducting Pacific slab, and the outer-rise area east of the Kuril-Japan Trench (Fig. 3), which were recorded at the 865 seismic stations in the study region (Fig. 1). These events generated 222,999 P and 196,061 S wave arrival times, which are used in the tomographic inversion.\nWe apply a tomographic method (Zhao et al., 1992a, 2015) to our data set to determine 3-D Vp and Vs models beneath the study region. To express the 3-D velocity structure, we arrange 3-D grid nodes in the study volume. Velocity perturbations from a starting 1-D velocity model (Fig. 4\n) at the grid nodes are taken as unknown parameters. The velocity perturbation at any point in the model is calculated by linearly interpolating the velocity perturbations at the eight grid nodes surrounding that point. Following the previous tomographic studies of East Japan (Zhao et al., 1992a, 2011; Wang and Zhao, 2005; Huang et al., 2011; Liu and Zhao, 2017, 2018), geometries of the Conrad and Moho discontinuities and the upper boundary of the subducting Pacific slab (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n) are taken into account in the velocity model. A 3-D ray-tracing technique (Zhao et al., 1992a) is used to compute theoretical travel times and ray paths. Station elevations and the surface topography are taken into account in the 3-D ray tracing. The LSQR algorithm (Paige and Saunders, 1982) with damping and smoothing regularizations is used to solve the large but sparse system of observation equations that relate the arrival-time data to the velocity and hypocentral parameters. Earthquakes are relocated in the inversion process, and their location errors are all smaller than 3 km, because all the events (Fig. 3) occurred beneath the dense seismic networks (Fig. 1).\n\n\n3\nAnalysis\n\n3.1\nGeometries of velocity discontinuities\nMany previous studies have shown the existence of the Conrad and Moho discontinuities in the Okhotsk plate and the upper boundary of the subducting Pacific slab beneath the study region, and their geometries under the land areas have been well determined by analysis of first P and S wave data, as well as reflected and converted wave data at the three discontinuities (for detailed reviews, see Hasegawa et al., 2009; Zhao, 2021). However, depth distributions of the three discontinuities beneath the Pacific Ocean are less accurate, although the Pacific slab geometry in the forearc has been estimated using the hypocentral distribution of interplate events relocated with sP depth phases (e.g., Umino et al., 1995; Zhao et al., 1997, 2011; Liu et al., 2013). On the basis of the previous results, seismicity located by the S-net, and twelve 2-D velocity profiles obtained by active-source seismic soundings in the East Japan forearc (Figs. 2 and 7-9\n\n\n, Table S1), we refine the geometry of the Pacific slab upper boundary under the Pacific Ocean (details are described in Katayama, 2021). Fig. 5 shows the obtained slab geometry model, which is generally consistent with the previous models in and close to the land areas, but it is considered to be more accurate, in particular, near the Kuril and Japan trenches. We have also used the 2-D velocity profiles (Figs. 2 and 7-9, Table S1) to improve the Conrad and Moho geometries in the Okhotsk plate under the forearc (Fig. 6), based on the previous results of the two velocity discontinuities in the study region (Zhao et al., 1992b; Katsumata, 2010; Bassett et al., 2016). In this work, the new geometry models of the three discontinuities (Figs. 5 and 6) are taken into account in the starting velocity model (Figs. 4 and S1) and they are fixed during the tomographic inversion. That is, only Vp and Vs perturbations at the 3-D grid nodes arranged in the study volume (see section 3.4) are determined by the inversion, the same as previous tomographic studies of the region (e.g., Zhao et al., 1992a, 2015; Wang and Zhao, 2005; Huang et al., 2011). These previous tomographic studies and also the present work show that, when the depths of the three velocity discontinuities vary in a reasonable range, there are some changes in the amplitude of velocity anomalies in the upper crust, lower crust and uppermost mantle, but the pattern of low-V and high-V anomalies does not change (e.g., Zhao et al., 1992a; Wang and Zhao, 2005; Huang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013; Katayama, 2021).\n\n\n3.2\nS-net station corrections\nA sedimentary layer exists on the Pacific seafloor and its thickness exhibits significant lateral variations under the S-net stations, which were investigated by Azuma et al. (2019) using P to S converted waves at the sedimentary basement. Then they determined P and S wave travel-time corrections at the S-net stations from the estimated thickness and velocity of the sedimentary layer (Fig. 10\n). The distributions of P and S wave station corrections exhibit the same pattern. They are small in the outer-rise area, but become very large off northern Tohoku. The P-wave station corrections range from 0.10 to 0.96 s (Fig. 10a), whereas the S-wave station corrections range from 1.20 to 3.78 s (Fig. 10b). In this work, the S-net station corrections (Fig. 10) are taken into account to calculate travel-time residuals for the earthquake relocation and tomographic inversion. Our results show that the S-net station corrections, in particular, for the S-wave data, are very important to obtain reasonable travel-time residuals (e.g., < 2 s) for the earthquake relocation and tomographic inversion. Without the station corrections, many S-wave travel-time residuals at the S-net stations are too large (amounting to 3-5 s) to be used for the earthquake relocation and tomographic inversion.\n\n\n3.3\nResolution analysis\nDetailed resolution analyses of our data set are made to examine the reliability of the obtained tomographic model. A direct way to evaluate the resolution of a tomographic model is to first calculate a set of synthetic travel-time data by tracing rays of the P and S wave data in a synthetic model, and then to compare the inversion result with the input synthetic model. We performed many checkerboard resolution tests (Zhao et al., 1992a) to assess the adequacy of the ray coverage and to evaluate the tomographic resolution of the study region. To make a checkerboard model, positive and negative velocity perturbations are assigned to 3-D grid nodes that are arranged in the study volume, the image of which is straightforward and easy to remember. Therefore, by looking at the image of the synthetic inversion for the checkerboard model, one can easily understand where the resolution is good and where it is poor. Random noise (-0.3 to +0.3 s) in a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.1 s is added to the theoretical travel times calculated for the synthetic model. Figs. S2 and S3 show the test results for Vp and Vs tomography, respectively. Both the checkerboard pattern and amplitude of velocity anomalies are well recovered, except for the edge parts of the model, which is expected.\nWe have also made several synthetic tests using different input models instead of the checkerboard model. The general procedure of these synthetic tests is the same as that of the checkerboard tests. Figs. S4 and S5 show two results of synthetic tests for Vp and Vs tomography, respectively. These results indicate that main features of the tomographic results, which are described in the next section, can be well recovered by the tomographic inversion of our data set.\n\n\n3.4\nTomographic inversion\nFollowing the previous tomographic studies of the Japan subduction zone as mentioned above, we adopt a 3-D starting velocity model that includes lateral depth variations of the Conrad and Moho discontinuities and the upper boundary of the subducting Pacific slab (Figs. 5, 6 and S1). In addition, a +4% high-Vp and +6% high-Vs anomaly is added to the Pacific slab in the starting model (Fig. S1). Adopting the reasonable 3-D starting model can greatly reduce the degree of nonlinearity of the complex tomographic problem and lead to a better solution, according to many previous tomographic studies of the Japan subduction zone and other regions (see Zhao, 2021 for a detailed review).\nAs compared with the land-based Kiban seismic network, the S-net is still quite sparse with a station interval of ~50 km or greater, and there are big station gaps near the coastal areas, in particular, off Hokkaido and in the junction area between Tohoku and Hokkaido (Fig. 1). To obtain a stable and robust tomographic result for the entire forearc region (Fig. 1), we adopt the optimal 3-D grid with a lateral grid interval of 0.5\u00b0 and a vertical grid interval of 10-20 km after making many trials. But the vertical grid interval is smaller for the upper part of the Pacific slab, because that part is well sampled by a great number of rays from the intraslab events (Fig. 3). Using our data set (Figs. 1 and 3) we conducted many tomographic inversions with different values of the damping and smoothing parameters, whose optimal values are obtained by considering the balance between the reduction of the root-mean-square (RMS) travel-time residual and the smoothness of the 3-D velocity model (Zhao et al., 1992a, 2011).\nFor the optimal 3-D Vp and Vs models, the RMS P-wave travel-time residuals before and after the inversion are 1.208 s and 0.349 s, respectively, and the corresponding S-wave RMS residuals are 0.743 s and 0.468 s, respectively. The variance reductions of the P and S wave data are 92% and 60%, respectively. Note that most of the large residuals come from the S-net arrival times of the suboceanic events. The RMS residuals for the obtained 3-D Vp and Vs models are still larger than the picking errors of the P and S wave arrival-time data (~0.1-0.2 s), which happens for all the tomographic inversions performed in various regions (e.g., Ishida and Hasemi, 1988; Hasegawa et al., 2009; Zhao, 2021). We consider that the degree of data misfit is mainly caused by uncertainties of the hypocentral parameters of the local events, especially the suboceanic events, as well as smaller-scale velocity anomalies in the study volume than the spatial resolution (or the grid interval) of the tomographic model.\n\n\n\n4\nResults and discussion\n\n4.1\nEarthquake relocation\n\nFig. 11\n shows an example of results of earthquake relocation from the initial hypocenters determined by the seismic network (the JMA unified earthquake catalog). The events occurred during 1 September to 15 December 2020 and were recorded by both the S-net and the Kiban network, hence they are generally well relocated. After the earthquake relocation, the RMS travel-time residual is reduced significantly for every event, suggesting that the relocated hypocentral locations are more accurate and reliable. The relocated hypocenters are also shown in seven vertical cross-sections together with the Vp and Vs tomographic images (Figs. 12 and 13\n\n). The local earthquakes in the East Japan arc take place in four zones: (1) the crust and the uppermost mantle wedge of the overriding Okhotsk plate; (2) the outer-rise area of the incoming Pacific plate; (3) the megathrust zone along the boundary between the Okhotsk plate and the subducting Pacific plate (slab); and (4) within the subducting Pacific slab. The intermediate-depth earthquakes within the slab form a clear double-planed seismic zone (Fig. 11), which was discovered over four decades ago (Umino and Hasegawa, 1975; Hasegawa et al., 1978). The upper-plane earthquakes take place close to the upper boundary of the slab, whereas the lower-plane earthquakes occur in the central portion of the slab. The separation between the two planes is ~30 km (Fig. 11).\nFor the crustal events in the overriding Okhotsk plate and the upper-plane events in the subducting Pacific slab under the land areas, the hypocentral changes after the earthquake relocation are small, being generally < 5 km (Fig. 11). However, the changes in the hypocenters become larger for the lower-plane events and those under the Pacific Ocean, because the JMA uses a 1-D velocity model to locate the events (e.g., Ueno et al., 2002), whereas we used the 3-D Vp and Vs models including the high-V Pacific slab (Figs. 12 and 13) to relocate these events. Most of the relocated lower-plane events in the slab have shifted westward, as compared with their initial hypocenters located by the seismic network. In the outer-rise area, earthquakes take place down to ~60 km depth (Fig. 11), being consistent with previous results of waveform modeling and inversion (e.g., Lay et al., 2013; Kubota et al., 2019).\nThe double seismic zone in the Pacific slab is visible in the forearc starting from the trench axis (Figs. 11-13), as suggested earlier by Gamage et al. (2009) who relocated the suboceanic events using sP depth-phase data. The slab earthquakes in the two planes have different focal mechanisms and exhibit regional variations. Beneath the Tohoku land area, the events in the upper and lower planes are dominated by down-dip compression and down-dip extension mechanisms, respectively (Umino and Hasegawa, 1975). However, a reverse pattern of focal mechanisms in the two planes occurs in Hokkaido (e.g., Suzuki et al., 1983; Katsumata et al., 2003). Due to the upward bending effect of the incoming Pacific plate in the outer-rise area, the upper-plane events near the Japan Trench are characterized by normal faulting, whereas the lower-plane events are characterized by thrust faulting (e.g., Gamage et al., 2009; Tamaribuchi et al., 2021; Obana et al., 2021), which are opposite to those of the double seismic zone beneath the Tohoku land area. The occurrence and focal mechanisms of the double seismic zone are explained by the slab deformation during its subduction, such as slab bending or unbending, as well as other processes including hydration and dehydration, compositional variations, and phase changes in the slab (e.g., Kao and Liu, 1995; Peacock, 2001; Hacker et al., 2003; Hasegawa et al., 2009).\n\n\n4.2\nThe subducting oceanic crust and slab\n\nFigs. 12 and 13 show seven vertical cross-sections of the optimal Vp and Vs tomographic models, respectively, obtained by this study. Note that the Vp and Vs perturbations in Figs. 12 and 13 are relative to the velocities of the upper crust, lower crust and upper mantle in the 1-D velocity model (Fig. 4), which are separated by the curved Conrad and Moho discontinuities (Fig. 6). Fig. S6 shows Poisson's ratio (PR) images, which are estimated from the 3-D Vp and Vs models using a simple relation between PR and seismic velocity (Vp, Vs; see Zhao et al., 2015 for details). The subducting Pacific slab exhibits high-Vp and high-Vs anomalies amounting to 6% and low-PR of 5-10% relative to the normal mantle.\nA thin low-velocity (low-V) layer with a thickness of ~5-10 km is visible atop the subducting Pacific slab and extends down to ~100 km depth beneath the volcanic front, which reflects the subducted oceanic crust (Figs. 12 and 13). The thin low-V layer is a reliable feature because it is well recovered by our resolution tests (Figs. S4 and S5). This feature is consistent with previous results obtained from analysis of PS and SP converted waves at the slab boundary (e.g., Matsuzawa et al., 1986, 1990; Zhao et al., 1997). Shiina et al. (2013) investigated the detailed Vp structure of the subducted oceanic crust beneath the Tohoku land area using arrival-time data of PS converted waves. They found that Vp of the subducted oceanic crust varies across the arc and increases abruptly at ~100 km depth beneath the volcanic front, from 6.5\u20137.0 km\/s under the forearc to 7.5\u20138.5 km\/s under the back arc. The Vp under the forearc is ~10% lower than theoretically expected values for the metamorphosed mid-ocean ridge basalt material. Seismicity in the subducted oceanic crust (i.e., the upper-plane events) becomes the most active at depths of 70\u201380 km (Kita et al., 2006), where the minimum Vp is revealed (Shiina et al., 2013). The significant Vp reduction suggests the coexistence of aqueous fluids with hydrous minerals in and around the top part of the slab. The abundant fluids may elevate pore fluid pressures and reduce effective normal stress, promoting intensive seismic activity in the low-V oceanic crust. These results suggest that the upper-plane events in the subducted oceanic crust are facilitated by fluid-related embrittlement (Shiina et al., 2013).\nA significant high-Vs zone dipping eastward is clearly visible under the Kanto district, and earthquakes occur actively within the high-Vs zone with a thickness of ~30 km (Fig. 13G). This feature is also visible in the Vp tomography beneath Kanto (Fig. 12G). This high-V zone reflects the subducting Philippine Sea plate, which has been also revealed by previous tomographic studies of the Kanto district (e.g., Ishida and Hasemi, 1988; Wang and Zhao, 2006; Matsubara et al., 2019). The active subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Okhotsk plate has resulted in many large megathrust earthquakes in and around the Kanto district, such as the great 1923 Kanto earthquake (M7.9) that caused ~100,500 fatalities and huge damage to the Tokyo metropolitan area (e.g., Utsu, 1982; Usami, 2003).\n\n\n4.3\nVelocity anomalies in the crust and mantle wedge\nBeneath the volcanic front and back-arc areas, significant low-V anomalies are visible in the central portion of the mantle wedge, sub-parallel with the subducting Pacific slab (Figs. 12 and 13). The low-V zones extend upward to the Moho discontinuity, and to the lower and\/or upper crust in some cross-sections (Figs. 12 and 13). The low-V anomalies also exhibit high attenuation (low-Q) and strong seismic anisotropy, which have been revealed by many previous studies of the East Japan arc using velocity tomography (e.g., Zhao et al., 1992a, 2015; Wang and Zhao, 2005; Huang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013; Matsubara et al., 2019), attenuation tomography (e.g., Tsumura et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Kita et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017; Wang and Zhao, 2019) and anisotropic tomography (e.g., Wang and Zhao, 2008, 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Niu et al., 2016; Wang and Zhao, 2021).\nA great number of previous studies of subduction zones in the past four decades have shown that the mantle-wedge low-V and low-Q anomalies are a common feature of subduction zones and reflect source zones of arc magmatism and volcanism, which are produced by joint effects of the convective circulation process (corner flow) in the mantle wedge and fluids resulting from dehydration reactions of the subducting slab (e.g., Tatsumi, 1989; Iwamori and Zhao, 2000; Scambelluri and Philippot, 2001; Stern, 2002; van Keken, 2003; Cagnioncle et al., 2007; Wiens et al., 2008). The velocity and Q anomalies in the mantle wedge are caused by several factors. Higher temperature, fluid content and melt fraction can all result in the low-V and low-Q zones (e.g., Conder and Wiens, 2006), whereas Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from hydration and melting may propel high-V anomalies (cold plumes) in the mantle wedge (e.g., Gerya and Yuen, 2003; Gerya et al., 2006; Gorczyk et al., 2006). Compositional variations can also produce velocity anomalies in the upper mantle. However, we have no a priori reason to suspect variable mineralogy throughout the mantle wedge, so the low-V and low-Q anomalies are considered to mainly reflect variations in temperature, melt fraction, and fluid content (Conder and Wiens, 2006).\nIn the forearc crust and mantle wedge under the Pacific Ocean, low-V anomalies prevail in both the Vp and Vs tomographic images (Figs. 12 and 13). These low-V zones may reflect accretionary prism materials containing abundant fluids, which are intrinsically less dense than the continental crust and upper mantle rocks, as revealed by many previous studies of active-source seismic soundings (e.g., Fujie et al., 2002, 2020; Miura et al., 2005; Nakamura et al., 2014; Azuma et al., 2018 and those listed in Table S1). Figs. 7-9 show comparison of our present Vp model with five active-source seismic profiles. Although our Vp tomography has lower resolution than the active-source profiles and so cannot reveal those detailed features in the profiles, the general patterns of the low-V zones look similar to those in the active-source profiles (Figs. 7-9). However, there is a difference near the trench axis (e.g., comparing Fig. 7a and b). This may be due to the fact that our Vp tomography has lower resolution near the trench, because the S-net station interval is quite large around the Japan trench (Fig. 1). We also need to point out that the Conrad and Moho topographies are used as a priori information in the initial model for the tomographic inversion, so they are not independent models and the similarity might be partly driven by the a priori constraints.\n\nYu and Zhao (2020) made a detailed discussion on the water migration and circulation processes in the forearc crust and upper mantle wedge associated with the hydration and dehydration processes of the incoming Pacific plate. Zhao et al. (2015) suggested that fluids resulting from the slab dehydration could ascend to the active faults in the crust of the overlying Okhotsk plate and so trigger large crustal earthquakes (M6.0-7.5) in the Tohoku forearc. The fluids from slab dehydration and their influences on large crustal earthquakes have been also revealed in the forearc region in South Hokkaido (e.g., Gou et al., 2019; Hua et al., 2019) and Taiwan (e.g., Toyokuni et al., 2016, 2021). Ruptures of intra-slab hydrated faults formed at the outer-rise may cause large intra-slab earthquakes under the Pacific coast (Wang et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusions\nUsing a large number of high-quality arrival-time data of local earthquakes recorded by the permanent seafloor seismic network (S-net) and the land-based Kiban seismic network, we determine detailed 3-D P and S wave tomographic images of the East Japan forearc. Depth variations of the Conrad and Moho discontinuities and the subducting Pacific slab boundary under the forearc are refined by referring to the results of previous studies including active-source seismic soundings and seismicity located with the S-net data. The obtained Vp and Vs images are quite similar to each other, both of which reflect the robust features of the 3-D seismic structure, including the high-V subducting Philippine Sea and Pacific slabs and low-V anomalies in the crust and mantle wedge beneath the active arc and back-arc volcanoes. Beneath the East Japan forearc region, significant anomalies with low-V and high Poisson's ratio are revealed in the crust and upper mantle wedge, reflecting accretionary materials containing abundant fluids, which are intrinsically less dense than the continental crust and upper mantle rocks beneath the land areas. The subducting oceanic crust atop the Pacific slab is revealed clearly as a thin low-V layer extending down to about 100 km depth under the volcanic front. This feature is consistent with the previous results obtained from analysis of converted waves at the slab boundary. Our results of earthquake relocation indicate that the double seismic zone in the subducting Pacific slab occurs from the trench axis down to ~180 km depth. Taking into account previous studies and the present result, we deem that the occurrence and focal mechanisms of the double seismic zone are caused by slab deformation during its subduction, such as bending or unbending, as well as other processes including hydration, dehydration, compositional variations, and phase changes in the subducting slab.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nDapeng Zhao: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing.

The Xianshuihe Fault Zone (XSHF) is one of the most active strike-slip faults on the eastern Tibetan Plateau (Li et al., 1997). As the boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block and Bayan Har block, the XSHF is the channel for the movement of matter and absorbs most of the crustal extrusion deformation (Li et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2015). Along the NW-striking, left-lateral XSHF, as many as 8\u00a0M\u00a0>\u00a07 and 29\u00a0M\u00a0>\u00a06.5 earthquakes have occurred since 1700\u00a0CE (Fig. 1b) (Wen et al., 2008). The Kangding segment is a special part of the XSHF that has four active faults and can exhibit large earthquakes (Ma et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020). The 1955\u00a0M 7.5 earthquake was the most recent event with a magnitude above 7.\nAlthough the Yalahe Fault (YLHF) is a branch fault of the Kangding segment of the XSHF, its activity remains controversial. Several researchers have suggested that the YLHF is an active Holocene fault (Allen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2001). However, one previous study believes that the YLHF has not been active since 4\u00a0Ma based on low-temperature thermochronology and geomorphology (Zhang et al., 2017). The Holocene activity of the southernmost segment of the YLHF is supported by fault outcrops and trenches at Sandaoqiao Village, which show the deformation of Holocene sediments (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2001). Owing to poor sediment age constraint from the trench (Zhou et al., 2001), only preliminary paleoearthquake reports exist. No detailed information is known concerning the earthquake sequence, recurrence pattern, or recurrence period from the YLHF.\nIn this study, we mapped accurate fault traces and deformed landforms based on detailed interpretations of high-resolution imagery and aerial photographs combined with field observations. Geological and geomorphological evidence was obtained for the Holocene activities of the YLHF. We found two faulted sections that constrained the paleoearthquake events. The paleoearthquake history of the YLHF was documented based on the deformation of stratigraphy and fault structures in the sections and radiocarbon-14 (14C) dating of the trench horizons. Finally, we discuss the recurrence characteristics and paleoearthquake correlations of the Kangding segment.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe XSHF is located at the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Many strong earthquakes have occurred along the fault zones (Allen et al., 1991). The XSHF originated from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and formed in the late Triassic due to the orogenic period of the Songpan-Garze orogenic belt (Li et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997). The XSHF separates the Sichuan-Yunnan block from the Bayan Har block (Allen et al., 1991). It plays a notable role in the late Cenozoic crustal deformation of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Wang et al., 2008). Traditionally, the XSHF has been divided into the Luhuo, Daofu, Qianning, Kangding, and Moxi segments from north to south (Fig. 1b) (Liang, 2019). Most of the XSHF consists of a single strand, except the Kangding segment, which consists of four branches. From north to south, these faults are the Yalahe Fault (YLHF), Selaha Fault (SLHF), Mugecuo South Fault (MGCF), and Zheduotang Fault (ZDTF) (Fig. 2\n) (Li et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2020).\nBecause the Kangding segment is a special section of the XSHF, research has focused on its fault activity for several decades. Previous studies have obtained the slip rates and paleoearthquakes of the YLHF, SLHF, and ZDTF. Using GPS data and earthquake relocation, Li et al. (2020) obtained geodetic rates of SLHF and ZDTF of 5.9\u20139.1 and 0.4\u20133.4\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively. By analyzing faulted landforms and dating the sample (using TL, 14C, and 10Be), the late Quaternary tectonic-geomorphology slip rates of SLHF and ZDTF were found to be 3.7\u201310 and 3.2\u201310.5\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively. The average slip rates of the SLHF and ZDTF are ~7 and\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively (Bai et al., 2018, 2021; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Yan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2001) (Table 1\n). There were 14 trenches along the SLHF and seven trenches along the ZDTF. Previous studies have reported 41 paleoearthquakes in the SLHF and 14 in the ZDTF (Feng, 2020; Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 1997; Liang, 2019; Ma et al., 2020; Yan and Lin, 2017; Zhou et al., 2001) (Appendix A).\nThe YLHF strikes nearly NW, changing from 320\u00b0 to 280\u00b0, starting near Huiyuansi Temple and extending southeastward through the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot and Yala Countryside (Chen et al., 2016). The length of the YLHF is approximately 70\u00a0km. It has been reported that an ~M 7 earthquake occurred in 1700\u00a0CE along the YLHF (Wen et al., 2008). Typical faulted landforms exist along the YLHF, including rivers, terraces, fans, moraines, and crests (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Liang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2001). Zhou et al. (2001) suggested that the Holocene active range of the YLHF ran from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Wangmu village, based on paleoearthquake and alluvial fan dislocation. Zhou et al. (2001) obtained a Holocene slip rate of >2\u00a0mm\/yr near the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot (Zhou et al., 2001). Li et al. (1997) considered the Holocene active range of the YLHF to be from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Xindianzi, based on the active landforms. Chen et al. (2016) determined that the active range was from Huiyuan Temple to Yala Mountain Scenic Spot, and the late Quaternary slip rate of YLHF was 0.6\u20131.5\u00a0mm\/yr based on the offset of till ridges and glacial troughs. Allen et al. (1991) inferred that the Holocene slip rate of the YLHF was 0.8\u00a0mm\/yr. Liang et al. (2020) found that the coseismic displacement of the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake was 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0m at Yalacuo Lake and thought that the active range was from the Yala Mountain Scenic Spot to Sandaoqiao Village. Li et al. (2020) obtained a geodetic YLHF rate of 0.8\u20133.8\u00a0mm\/yr based on GPS data and earthquake relocation. Three paleoearthquakes were obtained from two trenches in Wangmu village. Events 1, 2, and 3 occurred 7106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0114, 3461\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055, and 661\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Zhou et al., 2001). However, Zhang et al. (2017) inferred that the onset of motion along the XSHF was contemporaneous with the onset of the rapid exhumation of the Gongga batholith at \u223c9\u00a0Ma, and the YLHF, which is not active at present, was active between 9 and 4\u00a0Ma considering the low-temperature thermochronology of the batholith.\nHence, previous studies on the range of activity during the Holocene are inconsistent. The earthquake recurrence pattern cannot be constructed because of the small number of paleoearthquake events. Therefore, researching the activity and paleoearthquakes of the YLHF is of great significance for understanding the strain distribution and strong earthquake rupture mode of each branch fault in the Kangding segment of the XSHF.\n\n\n3\nMethods\nFirst, surface traces of the YLHF were mapped by conducting a field investigation and interpreting the satellite imagery. The signs for identifying the fault included fault ridges and the left-lateral offsets of landforms, such as rivers, terraces, fans, moraines, and crests. Second, to reveal the fault slip history of the YLHF, two faulted sections were collected for cleaning. In each section, we carefully cleaned the walls and documented fault structures, sedimentary characteristics (e.g., content, colour, and gravel size). The contrast colour, composition (e.g., fine gravel, coarse sand, and paleosol), and tiny structures (e.g., clumps, mixed accumulation structure) were used to identify the unit boundaries and scarp-derived colluvium exposed in each section. After logging the profile walls, approximately 100 photos were taken to cover both sections, then the Agisoft Photoscan software was used to merge these photos and generate orthogonal mosaic images for further analysis (e.g., Reitman et al., 2015).\nAt the typical faulted sites, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle to take low-altitude photos to obtain high-resolution topography using Agisoft Photoscan. The resulting hill shaded digital elevation models allow us to map the fault traces. We then used radiocarbon-14 (14C) dating methods to constrain the deposition ages of the strata. The 14C samples were prepared and analyzed at Beta Analytic Inc. (Miami, Florida, USA). Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It is a non-intrusive method of surveying the sub-surface to investigate underground utilities. GPR has many applications in several fields. In the Earth sciences, it is used to study sediment, bedrock, and fault. We used a GPR from Mal\u00e5 Geoscience Fortvaltnings AB, Sweden with 100 Mhz antennae to detect the fault below the Jingai section.\n\n\n4\nResults\nWe researched the active characteristics in two sites and cleaned their faulted sections, named SC1 and SC2, located near the Gadaliangzi and Jingai sites along the YLHF, respectively. In the following content, we present the geologic setting of each section site, stratigraphic characteristics, and paleoearthquake event determinations.\n\n4.1\nGadaliangzi\nAt the Galaliangzi site near the Huiyuansi basin, a number of seasonal rivers developed at the mountain pass, primarily depositing river terrace (T1, T2, and T3) and moraine sediments. The gullies, terraces, and moraine were displaced by the YLHF, resulting in obvious offset landforms (Fig. 3\n). T1 and the moraine on bed rock were broken, forming 15 and 46\u00a0m left-lateral dislocations, respectively (Fig. 3c). SC1 is located approximately 5\u00a0km southeast of Huiyuansi Temple. The YLHF is a wide fault zone that faults bedrock (Fig. 4\n, F1\u2013F4) and Quaternary sediments (Fig. 4, F6). The bedrock and Quaternary sediments were in fault contact (Fig. 4, F5).\n\n4.1.1\nStratigraphy\nThe length and width of SC1 were approximately 9 and 5\u00a0m, respectively. The bedrock on the northeast side of the fault zone was granite. The sediments on the southwest side of the fault zone mainly consisted of alluvial gravel layers deposited by the stream, divided into eight units. U1 and U2 are granite. The other units are Quaternary sediments (Fig. 5\n). These units were numbered in ascending order from bottom to top. The descriptions are as follows:\nU1: Bedrock (granite).\nU2: Bedrock (granite), with dense X joints.\nU3: Gravel layer (gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a02\u00a0cm), with off-white gravel and yellow sand lenses.\nU4: Gravel layer (gravel content ~80%, gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0cm).\nU5: Light yellow gravel layer (the gravel content is ~50%).\nU6: Gravel layer (gravel content ~70%, gravel diameter\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0cm).\nU7: Light gray clay layer.\nU8: Light gray gravel layer.\nU9: Loose soil.\nU10: Loose sediment on the surface, with more plant roots.\n\n\n4.1.2\nEvidence of paleoearthquake events\nObvious faulting evidence was observed in the section, such as gravel orientation and stratum faulting (Fig. 6\n). Based on the deformation, discontinuity, and lithological differences of the strata, 12 faults were identified. The dip direction of most faults was NE, and the dip angle ranged from 31\u00b0 to 73\u00b0. These faults in the SC1 faulted the bedrock and Quaternary sediments. F1 and F2 developed in the bedrock, and F3 was the contact boundary between the bedrock and the Quaternary sediments. F4\u2013F10 are internal faults of the Quaternary sediments. Bedrock U2 between F2 and F3 formed dense X joints owing to tectonic stress. Based on a comprehensive analysis of paleoearthquake markers and faulting deformation, three paleoearthquake events were identified: ET1, ET2, and ET3, from youngest to oldest.\n\n4.1.2.1\nMost recent event, ET1\nStrong evidence of the latest event, ET1, is clearly presented in the section. A displacement of ~20\u00a0cm was observed between U9 and U10 along the fault, indicating that F7 ruptured upward to the ground surface and that ET1 occurred after the deposition of U9 and U10 (Fig. 5 and 6a).\n\n\n4.1.2.2\nPenultimate event, ET2\nMultiple strong pieces of evidence indicate the occurrence of penultimate event ET2 in this section. F9 is the contact boundary between U6 and U4 and is covered by U9. The strata change was obvious near F9. F5 was the contact boundary between U6 and U8 and was covered by U9. Both F5 and F9 faulted U6 and ended at the bottom of U9. Therefore, they formed during the same event, ET2.\n\n\n4.1.2.3\nThird event, ET3\nF10 faulted gravel layers U4 and the bottom of U5, which was covered by the overlying U6 layer. The top of U5 was not faulted by F10. It was displaced by ~10\u00a0cm, based on the top of U4 along the fault. Therefore, ET3 occurred during the deposition of U5.\n\n\n\n4.1.3\nRadiocarbon dating\nFive carbon samples were collected and sent to Beta Analytic Inc. for age dating using an accelerator mass spectrometer (Table 2\n), and the calendar ages were corrected using the OxCal 4.3 program. The sample ages were in normal stratigraphic order; that is, the ages of the underlying strata were older than those of the overlying strata. However, the ages of samples JWRQ-1 and JWRQ-5 from U9 were approximately 2000\u00a0years apart. This is probably because the two ages were collected at the top and bottom of U9. JWRQ-8 (18981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP) and JWRQ-9 (22482\u201322,288\u00a0yr BP) were the ages from U5, and sample JWRQ-9 was possibly reworked from an older deposit. Samples of similar ages in the same layers were placed in a phase, and OxCal 4.3 was used to model the age of the paleoearthquake events (Lienkaemper and Ramsey, 2009).\nThe above analyses revealed that the latest event, ET1, formed after the deposition of U9 and U10, the penultimate event, ET2, formed between the deposition of U9 and U6, and ET3 occurred during the deposition of U5. The modeling results show that events ET1, ET2, and ET3 occurred in 3572\u20133450\u00a0yr BP to present, 8336\u20135465\u00a0yr BP, and near 18,981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n\n4.2\nJingai\nJingai is located between the villages of Yusi and Wangmu. The research site is located above the alluvial fan, and the YLHF passes through gullies, alluvial fans, and bedrock (Fig. 8\n). Faulted landforms were evident in this area. The river was broken to form a beheaded river, with a 62\u00a0m left-lateral dislocation (Fig. 8c). SC2 is located approximately 300\u00a0m south of a cattle farm. At the section location, the terrain has low relief, and the erosion effect is weak, which is conducive to the accumulation of fine-grained sediments.\n\n4.2.1\nStratigraphy\nThe length and width of SC2 were approximately 18 and 10\u00a0m, respectively. The sediments consisted mainly of alluvial gravel layers deposited by the stream. It was divided into eight units, among which N1 was divided into three sublayers (N1\u20131, N1\u20132, and N1\u20133) according to the gravel diameter. C1, C2, and C3 are the fault colluvial wedges (Fig. 9\n). These strata were numbered in ascending order from bottom to top. The descriptions are as follows:\nN1: Gravel layer (poor roundness, horizontal bedding of gravel can be seen locally, and gravel diameter of N1\u20131\u2013N1\u20133 gradually decreased).\nN2: Light gray clay layer with visible drag structure.\nN3: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226570%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a01\u20138\u00a0cm) with a yellow clay lens.\nN4: Light gray clay layer.\nN5: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226570%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a03\u20135\u00a0cm).\nN6: Light red clay layer.\nN7: Gravel layer (poor roundness, gravel content \u226580%, gravel diameter\u00a0~\u00a01\u20133\u00a0cm).\nN8: Loose sediment on the surface, with more plant roots.\nC1\u2013C3 are colluvial wedges.\n\n\n4.2.2\nEvidence of paleoearthquake events\nIn SC2, the faults are flower structures, and four faults can be identified (F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b). F1a, F1b, F2a, and F2b converge upward, and F2a and F2b converge to F1a. There is obvious faulting evidence in this section, such as gravel orientation, drag structure, and stratum faulting (Fig. 10\n).\nAfter rapid formation of the fault scarp, the sediment on the free surface continued to collapse. The accumulation formed at the foot of the fault scarp is a colluvial wedge (Deng et al., 1984), and is considered the main sedimentary evidence of the paleoearthquakes. Multiple surface ruptures can form multiple colluvial wedges. The sedimentary facies composition of the colluvial wedge is a lower layer of gravel and upper layer of fine-grained clastic sediments. During the interval of the earthquakes, the top of the colluvial wedge formed a soil layer due to weathering. In the case of many surface ruptures, multiple colluvial wedges and paleosol will be formed, providing an important basis for identifying paleoearthquakes. Therefore, the age of the top of the colluvial wedge can be considered close to the age of the paleoearthquake event. This is an important reason why the colluvial wedge is often used to define the age of a paleoearthquake. In SC2, we identified three colluvial wedges and dated their tops, representing three paleoearthquake events (EN2, EN3, and EN4).\n\n4.2.2.1\nMost recent event EN1\nStrong evidence of the latest event, EN1, is clearly presented in the section. A displacement of ~25\u00a0cm was observed based on N4 along F1a, indicating that F1a ruptured upward to N5\u2013N7 and was covered by N8. Therefore, EN1 occurred after the deposition of N5, N6, and N7 before that of N8.\n\n\n4.2.2.2\nPenultimate event EN2\nThere is a clear colluvial wedge (C1) next to F2b. C1 is at the top of N3, and is covered by N6. C1 is wedge-shaped with irregular borders. The gravel content of C1 is >70%. There is an obvious paleosol on the top of C1, and the age of the top of the C1 (paleosol) is close to the age of the paleoearthquake event. Thus, the age of the paleosol represents the age of penultimate event EN2.\n\n\n4.2.2.3\nThird event EN3\nNear F1a, we can clearly see C2, which is the largest of the three colluvial wedges. Its height is approximately 1.8\u00a0m. The gravel content of C2 is approximately 30%. C2 is at the top of N3 and is covered by N4; its altitude is lower than that of C1. There is an obviously paleosol on the top of C2. The age of the paleosol represents the age of the third event, EN3.\n\n\n4.2.2.4\nFourth event EN4\nC3 is located in the middle of N3, and the bottom of C2 has the lowest altitude and smallest scale. C3 is wedge-shaped with irregular borders owing to the faulted effect. The age of the top of C3 represents the age of the fourth event, EN4.\n\n\n\n4.2.3\nRadiocarbon dating\nA total of 12 carbon samples were collected and sent to Beta Analytics in the United States for age dating using an accelerator mass spectrometer (Table 3\n). The calendar ages were corrected using the OxCal 4.3 program. The ages of the samples were in normal stratigraphic order; that is, the ages of the underlying strata were older than those of the overlying strata. We found two samples, JPGM-C-1-1 and C-8-1, at the top and bottom of N8, with ages of 2660\u20132490 and 918\u2013773\u00a0yr BP, respectively. This proves that the deposition of N8 occurred over a long period of time. However, the age of sample JGPM-C-2-1 (5478\u20135319\u00a0yr BP) from N6 was younger than that of C-5-2 (6395\u20136280\u00a0yr BP) from N5. This explains the formation of N6 before that of N5. The age of sample C-4-1 (9309\u20139088\u00a0yr BP) was similar to that of JGPM-C-7-1 (9536\u20139426\u00a0yr BP). This indicates that the two samples were from the same layer (N4). The samples with similar ages in the same layers were placed in a phase, and the OxCal 4.3 program was used to model the age of paleoearthquake events similar to trench SC1.\nThe above analyses revealed that the latest event, EN1, occurred between the depositions of N6 and N8. Three colluvial wedges are revealed in the section (C1, C2, and C3) representing three paleoearthquake events: EN2, EN3, and EN4, respectively. The modeling results show that events EN1, EN2, EN3, and EN4 occurred during the ranges of 5478\u20132490, 6319\u20136269, 10,437\u201310,252, and 20,975\u201320,749\u00a0yr BP, respectively (Fig. 11\n).\n\n\n4.2.4\nGPR deep exploration\nWe used a GPR with a 100\u00a0MHz antennae to detect strata and faults nearly 3\u00a0m below SC2. The GPR results reveal the strata and faults below the section, and F1a below the section was found to be the main fault of the flower structure. Within 40\u00a0cm, the lineups were relatively continuous. This represents the soil layer on the surface. Below 40\u00a0cm, lineups were no longer continuous. The intensity of the reflected wave signal on both sides of the fault was different. The strata signal of the downthrown side was weak, which may be related to the lithology. Strata on both sides of the fault below 1.5\u00a0m displayed an obvious drag structure owing to the fault effect (Fig. 9c).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nPaleoearthquake sequence\nThe progressive constraining method was used to constrain paleoearthquake events and ages in the two sections and one trench (Fig. 12\n). The trench across the scarp in Wangmu village revealed that the fault cut the surface soil layer, and the layer under the surface soil layer formed in 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE; therefore, the most recent event (EV1) occurred after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE (Zhou et al., 2001). SC1 in Gadaliangzi indicated that F7 ruptured upward to the ground surface, and the most recent event (ET1) occurred after the deposition of U9 and U10. The upper part of U9 formed during 3572\u20133450\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, ET1 occurred between 3572 and 3450\u00a0yr BP. In 1700\u00a0CE, there was a strong earthquake event near Kangding, which is considered to have occurred in the YLHF (Wen et al., 2008). The most recent events, EV1 and ET1, identified in the trench and SC1 were interpreted as the same event (E1 of the fault). Based on existing historical earthquake data, the most recent event E1 of the YLHF is most likely the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\nThe trench across the scarp in Wangmu village revealed that the penultimate event (EV2) occurred after 1460\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055\u00a0BCE (Zhou et al., 2001). SC2 in Jingai revealed that the latest event, EN1, occurred between the deposition of N6 and N8. N6 and N8 formed during 5478\u20135319 and 2660\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, respectively. EN1 occurred during 5478\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. Strong evidence of penultimate event EN1 was observed in SC1. In addition, the ages of ET1 in SC1, EV2 in the trench, and EN1 in SC2 overlap in 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, the penultimate event E2 of the YLHF likely occurred in 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP. SC1 revealed that both F5 and F9 faulted U6 and ended at the bottom of U9. They formed during the same event, ET2. The lower part of U9 and U6 formed in 5587\u20135465 and 8336\u201381,983\u00a0yr BP, respectively. ET2 occurred between 8336 and 5465\u00a0yr BP. Wangmu village trench (ZT) is a relatively short distance away, about 5\u00a0km apart from SC2, the two sites are likely to rupture together. The third event, EV3, in the Wangmu village trench (ZT) occurred in 5105 BCE\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0114 (Zhou et al., 2001). There is a clear colluvial wedge C1 in SC2 that represents EN2. C1 formed during 6319\u20136269\u00a0yr BP. Considering the error between the date of the carbon sample from the colluvial wedge and the date of the related earthquake event, EN2 and EV3 actually be the same event. Therefore, event E3 of the YLHF likely occurred in 7168\u20136269\u00a0yr BP.\nThe age of EN2 in SC2 and ET2 in SC1 overlap in 6319\u20136269\u00a0yr BP. The ages of EV3 in the trench and ET2 in SC1 overlap in 7168\u20136940\u00a0yr BP. Therefore, the third and fourth events E3 and E4 of the YLHF likely occurred in 6319\u20136269 and 7168\u20136940\u00a0yr BP, respectively.\nThe age of colluvial wedge C2 in SC2 represents the age of EN3. EN3 occurred in 10,437\u201310,252\u00a0yr BP. Event ET3 in SC1 occurred during the deposition of U5. The modeling results show that ET3 occurred near 18,981\u201318,817\u00a0yr BP. The age of the colluvial wedge C3 in SC2 represents the age of the fourth event, EN4. EN4 occurred in 20,975\u201320,749\u00a0yr BP. These three events occurred over a long period of time. They were not observed in other trenches or sections. Therefore, these three earthquake events, EN3, ET3, and EN4, are independent of each other and represent E4, E5, and E6 of the YLHF, respectively.\nIn summary, six paleoearthquakes occurring since 21,000\u00a0yr BP were constrained from two sections and one trench. The ages of events E6\u2013E1, from oldest to youngest, are 20,975\u201320,749, 18,981\u201318,817, 10,437\u201310,252, 7168\u20136269, and 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, and after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE, respectively, and the most recent event may correspond to the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\n\n\n5.2\nRecurrence characteristics and paleoearthquake correlations\nFour events E1\u2013E4 occurred in the Holocene. Their intervals are 2728, 3741, and 3626\u00a0yr, respectively. This indicates that the average recurrence interval between E1 and E4 was 3365\u00a0yr. The event intervals in the Holocene are close. Two events, E5 and E6, occurred during the late Pleistocene. The intervals between E4 and E5, and E5 and E6, were 8555 and 1963\u00a0yr, respectively. Erosion from precipitation is strong in the study area, and the sedimentary strata may be discontinuous. After adding two events in the late Pleistocene, the average recurrence interval between E1 and E6 changes to 4122\u00a0yr. Taking long-term events into account, the average recurrence interval becomes longer and the possibility of missing events is greater. In particular, in the interval between E4 and E5, the events during this period were possibly not recorded in this 8555-yr interval. The interval between events E1 and E2 (2726\u00a0yr) longer than the interval between E2 and E3 (3741\u00a0yr). This indicates that the recurrence period of recent earthquakes has decreased.\nIn recent years, the coefficient of variation (CoV) of the recurrence interval has been increasingly used to quantitatively describe the recurrence behavior of earthquakes (Biasi and Scharer, 2015; Goes and Ward, 1994; Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 1994). To quantify the seismic recurrence behavior of the YLHF, we calculated the CoV of the recurrence interval of paleoearthquakes. CoV\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c3T\/\n\nT\n\u00af\n\n, where \u03c3T is the standard deviation of the recurrence interval, and \n\nT\n\u00af\n\n is the average recurrence interval (Guo et al., 2019). Based on the above formula and the recurrence intervals between the four Holocene paleoearthquakes, the CoV of the fault was calculated to be 0.13, indicating that the fault follows a quasiperiodic recurrence model (Kagan and Jackson, 1991). If the six events (E1\u2013E6) are considered during the calculation, the long interval between E4 and E5 would cause the CoV to increase to 0.56 but still indicate a quasiperiodic earthquake recurrence pattern. Therefore, the time interval of 2728\u00a0yr between the last two events is close to the average recurrence interval of 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. The average recurrence interval of 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene is more representative of the recent fault activity than the earthquake recurrence interval of 4122\u00a0yr, averaged from the six events. The elastic rebound model (Reid, 1910) is the basic theory for studying the behavior of seismic activity (Matthews et al., 2002). It is an efficient method that uses the paleoearthquake recurrence interval and coseismic displacement to constrain the horizontal slip rate of the fault according to elastic rebound theory (Ran et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013). Liang (2019) found the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake coseismic displacement of 2.5\u20133.5\u00a0m at Yalacuo Lake. The average recurrence interval was 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. Based on the coseismic displacement and recurrence interval, it is estimated that its horizontal slip rate is approximately 0.7\u20131\u00a0mm\/yr. It conforms to the late Quaternary tectonic-geomorphology (0.8\u20132\u00a0mm\/yr) (Allen et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2001) and GPS slip rates (0.8\u20133.8\u00a0mm\/yr) (Li et al., 2020).\nWe collected paleoearthquake data from the SLHF and ZDTF and used the progressive constraining method to constrain their events and ages in Holocene. Thus, 14 SLHF events and seven ZDTF events since 12\u00a0ka were obtained. For SLHF events, the results show that E1 and ES1, E2 and ES9, E3 and ES12, and E4 and ES14 overlap in time. For ZDTF, the results show that E1 and EZ2 overlap in time (Fig. 13\n). This shows that the YLHF and two adjacent faults (SLHF and ZDTF) may experience cascading rupture in the same earthquake. The paleoearthquakes of the YLHF and SLHF are more correlated owing to their close distances.\n\n\n5.3\nKinematic property and role in accommodating regional tectonic deformation\nThe XSHF is dominated by left-lateral strike-slip activity at the eastern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan block. It exhibits an arcuate shape that is convex northeast. While the NW XSHF has a single, linear, and continuous trace-striking N135\u00b0E for \u223c180\u00a0km, its geometry changes dramatically near the Kangding segment, where it splits into the four en echelon faults discussed here (YLHF-SLHF-MGCF-ZDTF) before resuming as a single fault trace striking N160\u00b0E (the Moxi segment) (Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2020). All four en echelon faults are left-striking. The YLHF exhibits an arcuate shape that is convex northeast. The strike of the fault zone changes from NWW in the northern segment to NW in the central segment, and to NNW in the southern segment. The strike changes of the XSHF and YLHF were similar, and the YLHF strike change was a microcosm of the XSHF in the Kangding segment. The two sections in this study revealed that the YLHF presents a normal dip-slip component and creates a negative flower structure. The change in the strike of the YLHF is accompanied by a change in the kinematic properties, indicating that the compression between the Sichuan-Yunnan block and the Bayan Har block reached a peak, which changed the strike of the XSHF. These changes were likely caused by the apparent change in the direction of clockwise rotation of the Sichuan-Yunnan block around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and the blocking effect of the South China block on the Sichuan-Yunnan block.\nOur results suggest that the average earthquake recurrence interval of the YLHF since ~12,000\u00a0yr is 3365\u00a0yr, which is shorter than the 5020-yr interval of the SLHF (Liang, 2019) but longer than the 500\u20132000-yr interval of the ZDTF (Li et al., 1997). Furthermore, it was first qualitatively inferred as 0.8\u00a0mm\/yr (Allen et al., 1991), before being constrained to >2\u00a0mm\/yr since 10\u00a0ka (Zhou et al., 2001) and 0.6\u20131.5\u00a0mm\/yr since 70\u00a0ka (Chen et al., 2016) from thermoluminescence ages. Therefore, assuming similar rates of 0.8 to >2.2\u00a0mm\/yr along the YLHF, and the tectonic-geomorphology average slip rates of SLHF and ZDTF are ~7 and\u00a0~\u00a04\u00a0mm\/yr, respectively (Bai et al., 2018, 2021; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 1997; Yan et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2001). The total late Quaternary slip rate across the YLHF, SLHF, and ZDTF was ~12\u00a0mm\/yr. Note that this rate is minimal because the rate along the Mugecuo South Fault is currently unknown. The YLHF shares part of the slip rate with the single-stranded XSHF. Based on the geometric analysis and structures in depth along the Kangding segment, YLHF, SLHF, MGCF, and ZDTF converged into one fault at a depth of approximately 15\u00a0km, and a flower-shaped structure was observed above this depth (Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). Therefore, the YLHF has the ability to cause large earthquakes in the future, similar to SLHF and ZDTF.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA detailed investigation of the paleoearthquake events of the YLHF and information collected from the Kangding segment yielded the following conclusions:\n(1) The Holocene active range of the YLHF ran from Huiyuan Temple to Jingai, based on paleoearthquake and geomorphological evidence.\n(2) Six recent paleoearthquake events of the YLHF were revealed using tectonic geomorphology, trench excavations, and radiocarbon dating. They were labeled E6\u2013E1 from oldest to youngest and occurred during 20,975\u201320,749, 18,981\u201318,817, 10,437\u201310,252, 7168\u20136269, and 3465\u20132490\u00a0yr BP, and after 1380\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0CE, respectively; the most recent event may correspond to the 1700\u00a0CE earthquake.\n(3) The YLHF features a quasiperiodic earthquake recurrence pattern. The average recurrence interval was 3365\u00a0yr in the Holocene. YLHF, SLHF, YLHF, and ZDTF may exhibit cascading ruptures during the same earthquake.\n(4) The deformed strata in the trenches show that the YLHF presents a normal dip-slip component and creates a negative flower structure, indicating that the fault is characterized kinematically by transtension.\n(5) The average earthquake recurrence interval of the YLHF since ~12,000\u00a0yr is 3365\u00a0yr, which is shorter than the interval of the SLHF, but longer than the interval of the ZDTF. The YLHF accumulates part of the slip rate of the single-stranded XSHF. Therefore, the YLHF has the ability to generate large earthquakes in the future, similar to SLHF and ZDTF.\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nJun Ma: Methodology, Software, Validation, Supervision.

The mission is dedicated to study the interior of Mars through seismology and heat flux. The main instrument, the seismometer SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2019, 2020) has successfully been deployed in January 2019 and it has been continuously recording the seismic activity of Mars since February 2019. The recorded seismic data have shown that Mars is seismically active with more than 900 \u201cmarsquakes\u201d detected in the v9 catalog released by the InSight Marsquake Service (MQS) which covers events detection until 2022\/01\/01. For more details on the MQS catalogs, see Giardini et al (2020), InSight Marsquake and Service (2021) and InSight Marsquake and Service (2022). The global seismic event rate sets Mars as moderately active, between the weak lunar activity and the terrestrial intraplate seismicity (Banerdt et al, 2020). However, no marsquakes of magnitude greater than four have been reported in MQS v9 and only a fraction of events exhibit clear body waves arrivals. In addition, none of the events show surface waves of amplitude greater than the Martian noise (Giardini et al, 2020), and depth phases pP and sS are difficult to identify in the data, making it complicated to estimate the hypocenter depths.\nDespite their low magnitude, the ten largest recorded low frequency events have been used for determining the first internal structure models of Mars from the crust to the core (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Khan et al, 2021; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021; St\u00e4hler et al, 2021). More specifically, based on the receiver functions study of Lognonn\u00e9 et al (2020) and confirmed in Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), the first ten kilometers of the upper crust beneath the InSight landing site appear highly altered and fractured. Below this first crustal discontinuity, as proposed by the seismic reflected phases analysis of Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), two models are described with two and three layers. For both velocity models, the martian equivalent of Moho discontinuity is located at 20 \u00b1 5km depth, and an additional discontinuity at 39 \u00b1 8km depth is estimated in the case of the three layers model. On a more regional scale, the upper mantle has been constrained with the first clear identifications of secondary phases, PP, PPP, SS and SSS (Khan et al, 2021) which confirmed an upper mantle structure controlled by a thermal lithosphere with a 400\u2013500km thickness. Finally, the observation of ScS core phases (St\u00e4hler et al, 2021) provided the first seismic estimation of the core radius at 1830\u00b140km.\nOn the source aspects and after the first magnitude estimations of Giardini et al (2020) and InSight Marsquake and Service (2021), Brinkman et al. (2021) have performed the first Martian moment tensors inversion for the two largest events, S0173a and S0235b. They not only highlighted the fact that single station methodology is sufficient to obtain stable and interpretable focal mechanism solutions but got also results in strong agreement with orbital imagery observations of an extensive regime and the global azimuths of Cerberus fossae. They also demonstrate the robustness of an inversion exclusively based on body waves despite strong assumptions on the internal model.\nWith an additional year of monitoring, we can now add seven additional LF and BB events to continue this single station source inversion. Even if less powerful than S0173a and S0235b, these new events are characterized by clear arrivals of P and S waves, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n larger than 3 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and see Table 1\n for details). They have been located between 25 and 40 to the east of InSight (i.e. corresponding to distances of 1500\u20132500km) with 3 to 4 error ellipsoids (from MQS catalog, InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021, and based on Drilleau et al, 2022 estimations). Five of them, like S0173a and S0235b, are located in the vicinity of the Cerberus fossae faults (Fig. 1\n) and confirm its seismicity. Cerberus fossae is a major graben system (e.g.\nVetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Roberts et al, 2012) and one of the largest structures close to the InSight landing site. Before the InSight mission, it was already studied with remote sensing data (Knapmeyer et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013) and was already referred as a potential seismic source with an average annual seismic moment release of 1015-1017 Nm\/yr (Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). In addition, recent volcanic activity is inferred in the region of Elysium Planitia (Vaucher et al, 2009; Hauber et al, 2011) and potentially associated with the regional seismic activity. The remaining event S0784a is located further south, and event S0325a is located on the Martian dichotomy that separates the contrasting terrains of the north and south and characterized by crustal structural complexities.\nThe main motivation of our study is that these marsquakes exhibit specific characteristics typical of tectonic earthquakes and located near peculiar volcanic\/tectonic features. Consequently, here we propose a seismo-tectonic analysis of the region to the east of InSight by constraining the seismic moment tensor of the nine seismic events aforementioned. The moment tensor is a good geometrical representation of the seismic source and is classically used to describe the faulting motion at the origin of quakes (e.g.,\nMolnar and Sykes, 1969; Michael, 1987; Henry et al, 2002). With InSight we are fortunate to be able to process the first seismic data on Mars, although restricted by the fact that there is currently only one seismic station on the ground surface. On the contrary, on Earth, seismic signals are usually recorded from dozen to hundreds of stations. The Earth data are moreover very well located geographically and at depth, compared to Martian data. Earth-based moment tensor analyses from a single station are only preliminary or exceptional works and from signals with a fairly larger SNR. Moreover, the internal structure is much better constrained for the Earth with high resolution 3D velocity models built from multiple decades of data accumulation.\nAfter Brinkman et al. (2021), the seven additional events will allow us to explore more deeply the seismo-tectonic context of Elysium Planitia. For that matter, we invert the moment tensors and discuss the results in terms of seismic origins, linked with the morphological observations of the region. Our methodology is principally based on a grid-search exploration over the three double-couple angles, i.e. the strike, the dip and the rake. For that matter, we invert P and S waveforms while estimating the seismic moment and the seismic attenuation. We also invert and compare the amplitudes of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS following their identification by Khan et al (2021) and Drilleau et al (2022). In addition, we provide estimates for the hypocenter depths and we then discuss why the absence of surface wave observations in the SEIS records do not exclude a crustal origin.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we first describe the general geological context and in Section 3 we present the InSight seismic data. In Section 4 we explain the inversion method. Then, the detailed results for S0235b and the general results of the nine marsquakes are presented in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the potential seismic sources, by comparing the selected mechanisms with the nearby major structures.\n\n\n2\nRegional context\nInSight has landed in Elysium Planitia at 4.5N 1356E, south of the Elysium Mons volcanic structure and near the dichotomy boundary (Fig. 1). From crater counting and geological unit series, the landing site is characterized by geological structures aged from Hesperian (3.7 to 3.2 Ga ago) to Early Amazonian (3.2 Ga to few ka ago, Tanaka et al, 1992; Warner et al, 2017; Golombek et al, 2018, 2020). The marsquakes S0173a, S0235b, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b, S0809a and S0820a are centered on the Cerberus fossae system while S0784a is located on lava plains in the southern vicinity of InSight and S0325a is located at the dichotomy boundary. Marsquakes S0173a, S0235b, S0809a and S0820a ellipsoids are determined by the InSight MQS InSight Marsquake and Service (2021) (green ellipsoids on Fig. 1) and the events S0325a, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b and S0784a are located by Drilleau et al (2022) (purple ellipsoids on Fig. 1). The location errors are large, ranging from \u00b1 3 (about \u00b1200km) to \u00b1 5 (about \u00b1300km) depending on the data quality. The ellipsoids can therefore cut across several regions over several hundreds of kilometers (e.g. in the case of S0484b which extends from Elysium Mons to the south of the Cerberus fossae system).\nThe center part of our study area is located on the Elysium Planitia terrains, expanding from the high plateaus of Aeolis and Zephyria, crossing the channels of Athabasca Valles and the graben systems of Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles (thick red lines on Fig. 1). Elysium Planitia, and more generally Mars, demonstrates many evidences of simultaneous or contemporaneous ages of hydrological and volcanic processes, notably with the observations of surficial guiding channels filled with lava flows (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003; Jaeger et al, 2007). The youngest lava flows are dated from 300Ma to 20Ma based on crater dating studies (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Vaucher et al, 2009; Hauber et al, 2011) and originated from recent volcanic activity in the central plains of Elysium Planitia form the Cerberus fossae volcanic unit. The fissures of Cerberus fossae would have enabled the flow of large volumes of these lavas as recently as 2.5Ma ago (Vaucher et al, 2009; Golder et al, 2020), and then escaping towards Athabasca Valles (Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003; Vaucher et al, 2009). It has been also suggested that other channels surrounding Grjot\u00e1 Valles have been formed by catastrophic overflows (Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Burr et al, 2002; Plescia, 2003). The large amounts of lava that have rapidly emerged from these channels have led to the hypothesis that massive dike networks exist in the subsurface (Ernst et al, 2001). These inferences would be in favor of a rather recent and dominant volcanic activity. Besides, magma transport and the potential magmatic chamber pressurization are known to generate seismicity on Earth (Grandin et al, 2012; Carrier et al, 2015).\nCerberus fossae (red thick lines in Fig. 1) is described by Perrin et al (2022), Taylor et al (2013) and Vetterlein and Roberts (2010) as a possible large dike-induced graben system of \u223c1200km long located at 1500km in the north-east of the InSight lander and in the northern part of Elysium Planitia. The orientation of the fossae (N100-110E) is coherent with the geometry of the supposed underlying dikes radiating away from Elysium Mons (Ernst et al, 2001). In addition, the Elysium Mons volcanic edifice is at the origin of a regional loading of the lithosphere with a negative Bouguer gravity anomaly (Neumann et al, 2004; Belleguic et al, 2005; Baratoux et al, 2014, and see Supplementary material S12), and may has experienced several and continuous episodes of activity between 4 and 2 Ga ago (Platz and Michael, 2011; Pasckert et al, 2012; Pan et al, 2020). The deformation associated with this regional loading may have impacted the formation of Cerberus fossae. Besides, Perrin et al (2022) observed that the widths and throws along the fossae decreased eastward, suggesting long-term propagation of the deformation away from Elysium Mons. This also implies that seismic activity is possible in the eastern, younger and less evolved parts of Cerberus fossae. Taylor et al (2013) have furthermore proposed that the recent tectonics activity of Cerberus fossae is less than 10 Myr, and they described the faults as active seismic sources with a general estimated seismic moment release of 1015-1017 Nm\/yr. This last value is larger than the observed Martian seismicity by about two orders of magnitude (Giardini et al, 2020). However, the seismic data recorded by InSight are consistent with the estimate by Taylor et al (2013) of 1.5 to 1.9 x 105 events generated per year from Cerberus fossae and furthermore, correspond to the present seismicity of Cerberus, while the one estimated from remote sensing is averaged since the onset of Cerberus activity. These two estimations can therefore be more coherent if one assume a time decrease of the seismicity of Cerberus. A dozen of events have indeed been detected and located in the vicinity of the graben system (Drilleau et al, 2022; InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022 and Fig. 1), although their exact seismic origin is not firmly established (see Section 6).\nThe southern end of the study area (red-yellow cratered terrains in Fig. 1) encompasses the Martian dichotomy in the Terra Cimmeria lands including the Apollinaris volcano and the ancient flood valley of Al Qahira Vallis. The dichotomy is a giant planetary structure located around the planet's equator and separating the oldest cratered highlands in the south aged about 4 Ga (Tanaka et al, 2011), from the younger lowlands in the north dated between 3 Ga and several ka ago (Tanaka et al, 2011). The highlands and the lowlands have a ground elevation difference of 4 to 6km. The dichotomy boundary has formed very early and has been subjected to many sedimentary accumulations and morphological reworking in a large part of the history of Mars (Frey et al, 2002). These successive sedimentary and volcanic processes have led to the formation of complex structures in the shallow crust of Mars including the upper regolith (Tanaka et al, 2011; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020). These complexities, as well as the very pronounced relative elevation contrast between the two hemispheres, are suspected to destabilize the seismic propagation notably by adding reverberation or crustal diffraction (Tauzin et al, 2019; Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021).\n\n\n3\nSeismic data from SEIS\/InSight\n\n3.1\nData generalities: frequency content and quality\nThe InSight seismic events are named according to the Martian sol (the Martian day since the beginning of the mission) on which they occurred and numbered in alphabetical order, e.g., S0235b occurred on 235th sol, after S0235a.\nFirst, the seismic event classification is done according to the frequency band in which the marsquakes have the most energy (for a complete overview of the seismic events classification, see Clinton et al, 2021). Thus, two main families are identified, the family of low-frequency events where the energy is observed mostly below 2.4Hz, and the high-frequency events family with energy mostly above 2.4Hz.\nThe family of low-frequency events contains the LF events (low-frequency), whose main energy lies below 2.4Hz, and the BB events (broadband) events, with their main energy below 2.4Hz but with a possible excitation above 2.4Hz. The LF and BB events are quite similar to each other. Their signals are characterized by an overall duration generally of 10 to 20 minutes with two distinct P and S phases, where the S-wave is more amplified than the P-wave. The SNR of these events is the highest among the entire seismic events catalog, on average from 2.5 to 20, and up to a factor of 200 (Banerdt et al, 2020; Giardini et al, 2020; InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022). Besides, spectrum analyses of LF and BB events have shown that they are similar to teleseismic earthquakes and shallow moonquakes (Banerdt et al, 2020; Giardini et al, 2020). Brinkman et al. (2021) further concluded on a probable tectonic origin with little diffraction for three LF\/BB events (i.e., S0173a, S0235b and S0183a) and suggested that S0235b and S0173a share a common origin. The low-frequency family is thus constituted by tectonic events, and we focus exclusively on their seismo-tectonic analysis in this manuscript.\nThe second family, the high-frequency events, includes the 2.4Hz, the HF (high-frequency), the VF (very high-frequency) and the SF (super high-frequency) events (see van Driel et al, 2021 for a complete description of the high-frequency family). The 2.4Hz events are excited around 2.4Hz with a very limited excitation above or below. HF events are centered on 2.4Hz and above mainly. A special case of HF, the VF, are characterized by a significantly larger energy on the horizontal components than on the vertical component at high frequencies. Finally, a last class identified are the SF seismic events with energy at more than 5Hz and up to 50Hz. The HF, VF and 2.4Hz are not located, so their analysis is based exclusively on the interpretation of their spectrum, and they are suggested to be small and shallow marsquakes (Clinton et al, 2021; van Driel et al, 2021). The SF are supposed to be related to local thermal variations (Dahmen et al, 2021).\nIn addition, all of the recorded marsquakes are classified with a quality grade from A to D (Clinton et al, 2021). From MQS definitions, quality A quakes correspond to high SNR events with clearly identified phases as well as the polarization of the P-wave and the S-wave trains, which provides the back-azimuth (BAZ) of the epicenter. Quality B events are very similar to quality A in terms of phases identification and waveforms, but without clear polarization and therefore less precise BAZ. For the C quality data, phases are observed but, either they are not identified, or only a single phase is identified, or multiple phases are identifiable but no clear P and S-waves can be attributed to them. The D quality events are the lowest quality data and are characterized by weak signals, or are likely not attributable to a seismic event (suspicious data). Since 2019, InSight has recorded a majority of high frequency events family, with more than 700 2.4Hz events, more than 1000 SF, 95 HF and 56 VF, whereas only 44 LF and 25 BB events have been recorded to date (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2022). 6 events are of quality A (LF\/BB events exclusively), 133 are of quality B, more than 500 are of quality C and more than 800 are of quality D.\nThe InSight seismic data (InSight Mars SEIS Data Service, 2019) contain large amounts of glitches, described as a transient instrumental noise likely associated to thermal tilts or dislocations (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Scholz et al, 2020). In practice, glitches are characterized by a high amplitude pulse of generally 10\u22128\nm\/s. Two of our selected LF events, S0173a and S0409d, are contaminated on the P-wave by glitches. Fortunately, S0173a glitch arrives long enough after the main P-wave peak and does not affect our calculations, while we use the deglitched S0409d time series (with the IPGP deglitching technique, Scholz et al, 2020).\nIn this study, we select nine marsquakes exclusively in LF\/BB frequency ranges and of qualities A and B. They all display clear picks of P- and S-waves, high SNR, and have been located with small error bars (see Section 3.2 below).\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic event locations and depths\nEvents S0173a, S0235b, S0809a and S0820a have been located by MQS (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021; Giardini et al, 2020). These locations are shown by the green probability ellipsoids on Fig. 1. The BAZ was calculated from polarization analysis of the first P-waveform and the epicentral distance was deduced from the P\u2013S time delay and pre-launch a priori velocity models (Khan et al, 2016; B\u00f6se et al, 2017; Clinton et al, 2017).\nThe recent work from Drilleau et al (2022) proposes additional BAZ values for other qualities A and B events. This is measured with the energy along the horizontal component, in addition to correlation and coherency coefficients between horizontal and vertical components. These BAZ estimations and epicentral distances are moreover in good agreement with MQS ones for the quality A events, and allow to add news locations for 5 quality B events (S0325a, S0407a, S0409d, S0484b and S0784a). Their locations are represented by the purple ellipsoids on Fig. 1. The epicentral distance, BAZ and origin time of all events are listed in Table 1.\nThe depths of the events are not precisely known, but the values are in agreement for seismic sources at moderate depths below the Moho (\u223c 30km with large errors) for most of the LF\/BB events (Brinkman et al., 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). However, the observed pP and sS depth phases (Brinkman et al., 2021, Drilleau et al, 2022 and St\u00e4hler et al, 2021) provide depth constraints with uncertainties of several tens of kilometers. Last but not least, the lack of clear observations of surface waves in the InSight data does not seem to support shallow seismic sources. This raises concerns about the nature of the source and the link with shallow and\/or crustal tectono-volcanic activity, and will be addressed later in Section 6.\n\n\n\n4\nMoment tensor inversion methodology\nWith only one seismic station and the uncertainties on Mars structure and a strong observed scattering (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Karakostas et al, 2021; Menina et al, 2021; van Driel et al, 2021) we had to adapt the classical moment tensor inversion method used on terrestrial data. Our approach is based on a grid-search exploration method for which we are seeking three source parameters: strike, dip and rake angles. Therefore, this inversion resolves the double-couple (DC) solutions of the moment tensors and will restrict the analyses to fractures or faulting sources. The isotropic (ISO) and compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) components of the moment tensor will therefore be ignored, which might be a limiting factor for tremor sources in Cerberus fossae (Kedar et al., 2021). The DC components represent the fault direction (strike), steepness (dip), and movement (rake) and are visualized in a spherical space through focal mechanisms (Jost and Herrmann, 1989; Henry et al, 2002). In addition, the solutions are non-unique following two conjugate fault planes (or nodal planes), which correspond to the two triplets of strike, dip and rake angles.\nFor each parameters combination, we compute a cost function composed by several fitting terms with weighting factors. Those with the lowest cost function correspond to the best-predicted moment tensor solutions. The methodology differences with Brinkman et al. (2021) are the following:\n\n\u2022\nin order to improve the waveform fitting, we also explore the apparent attenuation of the direct phases through an apparent quality factor Q. As compared to previous estimations which inverted Q and the seismic moment through displacement spectral fitting (Giardini et al, 2020), the Q factor and the seismic moment M\n0 are inverted in the time domain for ground velocity, taking advantage that the InSight noise has been found flat in ground velocity in the bandwidth of interest (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Stutzmann et al., 2021) and can therefore be considered as white. This is likely reducing the impact of long period noise in the inversion.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn addition to the body waveform fitting, we add the fitting of the secondary phase amplitudes of PP, SS, PPP and SSS as supplementary constrains.\n\n\n\u2022\nLast but not least, we account for the non-observation of surface waves and reject solutions with synthetic surface wave amplitudes larger than recorded amplitudes in the data surface wave windows.\n\n\n\n\n4.1\nSynthetic seismograms computation\nWe use the Direct Solution Method (DSM) Kernel Suite (Geller and Ohminato, 1994; Geller and Takeuchi, 1995; Fuji et al, 2012, 2016) for an efficient Green's functions computations, this being done for the six components of DC source and all distances between source and stations.\nIn our case, DSM is computing synthetics for a spherically symmetric Mars model with discontinuities. We use the \u201cTAYAK\u201d model (Khan et al, 2016), which integrated the pre-launch knowledge on Mars (Smrekar et al, 2019), but modified it to account for the crustal structure, as constrained by the receiver functions analysis of Lognonn\u00e9 et al (2020) and Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021).\nThis updated TAYAK model is displayed on Fig. 2\n. The crust includes therefore a first interface at 10km (Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020) and has the crust-mantle discontinuity at 24km (Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021), which we will simplify with the term \u201cMoho\u201d hereafter. Another modified TAYAK model with a 3rd discontinuity boundary at 43km depth (potentially the Moho discontinuity) as proposed by Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), has also been used for sensitivity tests in Supplementary material S11. Our inversion methodology does not invert the arrival times of the direct phases nor those of the secondary phases but explore differences in attenuation. We are therefore mostly sensitive to the differences in the elastic geometrical spreading with respect to other models, including those recently proposed by Khan et al (2021) and St\u00e4hler et al (2021). These differences are integrated in the final determination of the seismic moment, but not in the geometry of the source.\nThe DSM Green's functions are pre-calculated up to 0.8Hz (or period of 1.25 sec) at the fixed epicentral distances and BAZs compiled on Table 1. The synthetics cover therefore the bandwidth used for inversion, which is generally 0.1\u20130.5Hz. They are computed with source depths up to 90km, which includes widely the depth ranges proposed by Brinkman et al. (2021), Drilleau et al (2022) or Khan et al (2021).\nThe synthetics are computed with a very low attenuation, i.e. a large initial quality factor Q\n0 of 2000 and the phase attenuation is therefore modeled in the phase inversion process.\n\n\n4.2\nTime series pre-processing and inversion setup\nWe pre-process the 20 sps (sample per second) SEIS VBB raw data by detrending and removing the instrumental response, from counts to ground velocity. A high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.006Hz was used in the instrument correction.\nThe three axis VBB data, as recorded on the sensor directions U,V,W, are then rotated to vertical-radial-transverse (ZRT) components based on the event BAZs (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). The same is made for the synthetics from ZNE to ZRT. Then, the time series are band pass filtered, in bandwidths depending on the energy content of each event (the considered parameters are listed on Table 1).\n\n\n4.3\nMoment tensor grid search: generation of synthetics\nThe first grid-search exploration is conducted in the depth range of 12 \u2013 90km with a 3km step. For each depth, we explore all moment tensor geometries with strike, dip and rake respectively between 0 and 360, with a 9 step, between 0 and 90, with a 4 step and between \u2212180 and 180, with a 9 step. Then strike, dip and rake are converted into the full moment tensor components M\n\nrr\n, M\n\n\u03b8\u03b8\n, M\n\n\u03d5\u03d5\n, M\n\nr\u03b8\n, M\n\nr\u03d5\n and M\n\n\u03b8\u03d5\n where r, \u03b8 and \u03d5 correspond to spherical coordinates in the up-south-east convention. The six corresponding synthetic Green's function are then multiplied by these components and summed up to generate the synthetic corresponding to an unitary moment tensor (MT).\n\n4.3.1\nP and S waveform fits: quality factor, seismic moment and phase shift\nDue to the uncertainties on the velocity model and in order to adjust the amplitude of the synthetics to the data, we perform a secondary grid-search over the seismic attenuation 1\/Q and phase shift and invert linearly the associated seismic moment M\n0.\nThe seismic attenuation integrates both the intrinsic (Q\n\ni\n) and scattering (Q\n\nc\n) and is generally approximated as 1\/Q\n=1\/Q\n\ni\n\n+1\/Q\n\nc\n (Romanowicz and Mitchell, 2015). It is far to be at this time constrained for Mars, and proposed values for Q\n\nS\n are of the order of 300\u2013500 for lithospheric path (Brinkman et al., 2021; Giardini et al., 2020). On the long period side of the LF-BB events (0.1\u20130.5Hz), assuming a predominance of intrinsic attenuation mostly related to shear is a reasonable approximation, which leads to Q\n\nP\n\n\u221d9\/4\u00b7\nQ\n\nS\n. On the shorter period side (0.5\u20132.5Hz), scattering is likely dominating, with not only smaller Q\n\nS\n but with also smaller Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n and therefore a subsequent complexity on the a priori Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n ratio as well as frequency dependency (see Aki, 1997 for an overview of the impacts of scattering on the quality factor). Based on the uncertainties on the Q\n\nP\n\/Q\n\nS\n ratio for short period waves, we therefore limit our analysis to the long period side and keep the Q\n\nP\n\n\u221d9\/4\u00b7\nQ\n\nS\n ratio.\nThus, we invert the quality factor in a waveform fitting process. For that, we explore both new quality factors Q\n\nP\n for P-wave on the Z (PZ) and R (PR) components, and Q\n\nS\n for S-wave on the Z (SZ) and T (ST) components. Exploration is made for Q\n\nS\n ranging from 160 and 670 with step of 25 (equivalent to Q\n\nP\n ranging from 360 to 1500, with step of 57). It includes the effective Q\n\u223c300 proposed by Giardini et al (2020) for LF events at distances ranging from 25 to 45\u2218 as well as Mars a priori Q\n\n\u03bc\n (Smrekar et al, 2018; Lognonn\u00e9 and Mosser, 1993).\nTo perform the attenuation correction, the spectra of the synthetic body wave timeseries are calculated over a window starting on the arrival times computed by the TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) and with a duration of \u00b120 seconds around the phase in order to minimize Gibbs effects. The original synthetic spectrum S\n0(\u03c9) is thus corrected with a \u03c9\n2 source (Aki, 1980) and attenuation terms as:\n\n(1)\n\nS\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n=\n\n\n\nS\n0\n\n(\n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n(\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\u03c9\nc\n\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nexp\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\u03c9\nT\n\n2\n\n(\n\n1\nQ\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\n\nQ\n0\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c9\n\nc\n are the angular frequency and cutoff frequency respectively, and T is the wave propagation time. The cutoff frequencies, different for P and S, are following the scaling laws of Sato and Hirasawa (1973), similar to those used by Mocquet (1999):\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n10\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03c9\nc\nP\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n5\n\u2212\n0.35\n\u00b7\n\nlog\n10\n\n(\n\nM\n0\n\n)\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n10\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03c9\nc\nS\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nlog\n10\n\n(\n\n\n\n\u03c9\nc\nP\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n)\n\u2212\n0.2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M\n0 stands for the MQS estimations for all the marsquakes as a first step (see Table 1).\nThen, once the new attenuated spectra S is calculated from Eq. (1), for each Q\n\nP\n\n\u2212\nQ\n\nS\n, we explore the seismic moment M\n0 and the phase shift. We determine the phase shift between the synthetic and the observed signal computed on a window of \u00b1 1.5 seconds centered on the maximum of the observed body wave. Thus, we allow the phase exploration over one wavelength around the maximum of amplitude. We define \u03c4\n\np\n and \u03c4\n\ns\n as the delays on the P- and the S-waves respectively.\nWe invert the body waveforms by computing the following variance function \u03b7 between synthetics and observed data on the 4 components:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n\u0394\n\nT\np\n\n\n\ndt\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\nPZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nPZ\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nP\n\n\nPZ\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\np\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nPR\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nP\n\n\nPR\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\np\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u222b\n\n\u0394\n\nT\ns\n\n\n\ndt\n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\nSZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nSZ\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nZ\n\n\nSZ\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\nST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nobs\nST\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\n\nQ\nZ\n\n\nST\n\n\n(\nt\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\ns\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nd\n\nsyn\n,\nQ\n\nC\n\n is the inverse Fourier transform of S for the direction C (Eq.

The duration of the windows are of 10 seconds, as a compromise between stability and the need to avoid contamination by later secondary phases as much as possible. In our approach, the \u03b5 weights have been chosen empirically to ensure a balance between quality of the fits and solutions stability at every depth (see the Section 5.1 for the final weighting values). According to our tests the PZ and ST synthetics are less sensitive to the model structure and consequently have an higher \u03b5.\n\n\n4.3.2\nSecondary phase amplitudes\nOn the basis of the rescaled synthetics described above, we compute the amplitude ratios between synthetic secondary phases and direct body waves, and compare the value with the observed signals. Using Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n factors is likely a significant approximation as the PP, PPP, SS and SSS rays are not propagating at the same depths as the P and S-wave. We exclusively focus on the maximum amplitudes of the Z component of PP, SS, PPP and SSS, and their associated P and S maximums (i.e. PP over P, PPP over P, SS over S and SSS over S).\nFor example in the case of the secondary phase PP, the maximum amplitude ratio is calculated as:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nAmp\nPP\n\n=\n\n\nmax\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nPP\n\n)\n\n\nmax\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nP\n\n)\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere d\nPP and d\nP correspond to the observed or synthetic time series on a 5-seconds window for PP and P phases, respectively.\nThe observed secondary arrival times are compiled in Khan et al (2021) and Drilleau et al (2022), summed up in Table 2 and computed with TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) on synthetics.\n\n\n\n4.4\nTotal cost function: solution selection\nWe select the best moment tensor solutions based on the lowest cost function value, which is the sum of eight separate terms; four terms on body wave fits of PZ, PR, SZ and ST, and four terms on secondary phase amplitude comparisons of PP, SS, PPP and SSS.\nThe synthetic body waves result from Section 4.3.1 computations, for each set of Q, M\n0, \u03c4 and MT geometry. The body wave cost function \u03c7 is calculated with a root mean square (RMS) difference evaluation on the body waveforms for each body wave component:\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c7\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nsyn\n\n(\ni\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\nd\n\n\nobs\n\n(\ni\n)\n)\n\n2\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \u03c7 is computed at each point i over a 10 seconds window and N corresponds to the number of points (200).\nFrom secondary amplitude computation in Section 4.3.2, we then compute the RMS difference \u03ba between observed amplitudes and synthetic amplitudes with the equation:\n\n(8)\n\n\u03ba\n=\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nAmp\nsyn\n\n\u2212\n\nAmp\nobs\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe terms Ampsyn and Ampobs account for maximum amplitude ratios of synthetics and observed data respectively (Eq. (6)).\nTherefore, the total cost function \u03a6 is the sum between \u03c7 (Eq. (7)) and \u03ba (Eq. (8)). We weight each cost function terms with weights \u03b1 and \u03b2 and the sum of the total weight is 1, i.e. \u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\n=1:\n\n(9)\n\n\n\n\n\u03a6\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\u00b7\n(\n\n\u03c7\nPZ\n\n+\n\n\u03c7\nPR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\u03c7\nSZ\n\n+\n\n\u03c7\nST\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n\u00b7\n(\n\n\u03ba\n\nPP\n\/\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\u03ba\n\nSS\n\/\nS\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u03ba\n\nPPP\n\/\nP\n\n\n+\n\n\u03ba\n\nSSS\n\/\nS\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final constrain is applied to choose the best solutions. As there is a lack of clear surface wave observations in the InSight data, we are looking for solutions where the synthetic surface waves are weaker than the current observed data level.\nIn this end, we evaluate the ratio \u03b3 of the quadratic mean between the synthetic surface waves and the Martian noise, and of the observed surface waves, with the following equation:\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b3\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSW\nsyn\n2\n\n+\n\nSN\nobs\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSW\nobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nSW corresponds to the spectra over the surface wave windows and SN is the spectrum of the data noise. The spectra are calculated on the Z component and filtered between 15 and 50 seconds (0.02\u20130.067Hz). The surface waves window starts 100 seconds after the S-wave and last 90 seconds for both synthetic and data. The noise signal is selected in the 5-minutes window prior to the arrival of the P-wave from the MQS pick (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021) and over a 90 seconds window. The solutions with \u03b3 ratios superior to 1 are rejected.\nNote that once the total inversion process is completed for one event, we perform a secondary inversion. The evaluation of the source term in Eq. (1) is adjusted, where we implement the refined cutoff frequencies (Eq. (2)) calculated with the best M\n0 (from Eq. (5)).\n\n\n\n5\nInversion results\nIn this section we present the inversion results for the nine marsquakes. We first describe the inversion parametrization. We then show the S0235b results in a more detailed way in order to represent the complete computation for a single quake. Then, we summarize the results found for the whole dataset and we detail the preferred solutions per event. The complete overviews of the results for all the seismic events, from S0173a to S0820a, are described in Supplementary materials.\n\n5.1\nInversion parametrization\nIn order to validate our method and its parameterization, we invert a terrestrial earthquake in a context comparable to the Martian conditions of InSight (intraplate earthquake, addition of Martian noise, velocity model of Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), located at 1600km epicentral distance on a 25km thick crust). The resulting moment tensors with our single-station approach are in strong good agreement with the USGS (Guy et al, 2015) and the GFZ (Quinteros et al, 2021) inversions. The details of this inversion and the results of this test are available in Supplementary material S9. Besides, we also compute two sensitivity tests on the S0235b event; the sensitivity to the BAZ of the event (Supplementary material S10) and the dependency towards the velocity model (Supplementary material S11).\nWe have chosen the inversion weights according to the best compromise on the ratio of the weights in the variance \u03b7 (\u03b5 in Eq. (4)) and in the total cost function (\u03b1 and \u03b2 values in Eq. (9)). For \u03b5 weights, we observe that the ratio of 0.4 on PZ and ST and 0.1 on PR and SZ is the most appropriate in order to obtain good fits on the maximum number of components as well as better solution stability. A ratio of \u03b1 = 0.7 on the body waves and \u03b2 = 0.3 on the secondary phases is retained to account for the discrepancy in the number of points between body wave terms and secondary phases.\nFurthermore, we make two cost function analyses (Eq. (9)) for all the marsquakes in order to investigate the stability of solutions at higher depths. Thus, we separate; i) \u03a61 as the full cost function results (\u03b1\n=0.7, \u03b2\n=0.3), which encompasses the four body wave terms (PZ, PR, SZ and ST) and the four secondary phase terms of (PP, SS, PPP and SSS); ii) \u03a62 as the partial cost function, including the four body wave terms (PZ, PR, SZ and ST) and only the two secondary phase terms of PP and SS. This partial cost function \u03a62 is mainly used to explore deeper solutions as PPP and SSS are limited to \u223c 40km depths.\n\n\n5.2\nS0235b event results\nThe 20 best body wave fits at each depth (over a total of 32000 solutions at each depth, between 12 and 57km) are represented on Fig. 3\na for the case of \u03a61 cost function terms, and on Fig. 4\na for the case of \u03a62 terms. In these Figures, we calculate the body wave fits on the 10 seconds window on PZ, PR, SZ and ST components. We also display the associated misfits for each component, normalized separately between 0 and 1. We observe that the main energy peak is well retrieved on the four body wave components. Notably ST is very well constrained and has small and very stable misfits, although the first five seconds of signal are not retrieved in the calculation and the fits focus more on the main wavelength occurring after 5 seconds. This is explained by the fact that the maximum of the observed ST amplitude is located at about 5 seconds after the arrival of the S-wave, despite the first oscillation at \u223c 2 seconds. The synthetics are therefore rephased (from \u03c4\n\np\n and \u03c4\n\ns\n, see Section 4.3.1) according to this maximum and ignore the first seconds of signal. Since we rephase all components of the S-wave with the same phase, the early signal is also ignored on SZ. Concerning the SZ component, the maximum pulse at 6 seconds is not well estimated for between 12 and 24km depths. On the other hand in the case of the P-wave, the last 5 seconds of the signal are slightly underestimated for PZ and the main peak is well estimated. PR is very well retrieved at all depths except at 12km depth for \u03a61 evaluation.\nIn addition to these Figures, the observations on the body waveform fits for the 4 components are consistent with the body wave spectra (on Figs. 3b and 4b). PZ, PR and ST components are well retrieved and in agreement with the data for both amplitudes and spectral shape. The SZ spectra are the least resolved, as the general shape of the spectra is shifted towards the high frequencies compared to the data and is strongly underestimated. As observed in the time domain of Figs. 3a and 4a, the SZ shallow depth solutions are the worst, with more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of the observed data. This is certainly explained by the weaker evaluation and the bad phase shift of the SZ waveforms in the first 5 seconds.\nThe synthetic surface wave spectra on the right panel of Figs. 3c and 4c are much weaker by about one order of magnitude than the Martian noise at all depths.\nWe represent the secondary phase amplitude results on Figs. 3d and 4d. On these, PP, SS, PPP and SSS timeseries are presented on a 11-seconds time window, where we add 3 seconds of signal (gray areas) before and after the effective secondary phase window. We display the normalized misfits on the right panels. The synthetic and observed waveforms are shifted according to their maximums (green dashed line) for better readability. From TauP computations, in the case of S0235b, the synthetic secondary phases PPP and SSS are not detected below 37km (\u03a61 case), and SS are absent below 59km (\u03a62 case). The secondary phase maximums are overally well retrieved at all depths and similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62 analyses. Especially, PP and PPP display small and stable misfits. SS and SSS are slightly less constrained. SS stabilizes below 24km depth in both \u03a61 and \u03a62 cases. SSS is overestimated at 12 and 18km depths.\nWe then visualize the magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n and quality factors Q\n\nP\n for the P-wave and Q\n\nS\n for the S-wave on Fig. 4e. The \n\nM\nw\n\n and Q values globally are very similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62. The crustal \n\nM\nw\n\n tends to 2.9. Below 30km, the \n\nM\nw\n\n is very stable and tends to 3.2. Our \n\nM\nw\n\n values are in agreement with those computed in Brinkman et al. (2021) (value of 3.1, in pink dashed line), but underestimated compared to the MQS with values of 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021).\nThe mean Q evaluation is oscillating from 12 to 57km depth between \u223c 500 and 1000 (corresponding to Q\n\nS\n values of 300\u2013600) and are certainly related to the mean Q step of \u223c40. The general shapes of the spectra on Figs. 3b and 4b are also affected by the attenuation value, which impacts the slope of the spectra. The higher the attenuation (i.e. Q is small), the flatter the spectrum is at high frequencies and the higher is the M\n0 to compensate. In the case of S0235b, the 3 component spectra of PZ, PR and ST are quite reliable to the data, and thus we can expect that the attenuation is rather well estimated. Indeed it is coherent with Brinkman et al. (2021) values of \u223c 500, despite being overestimated compared to Giardini et al (2020) evaluation of 320.\nOn Fig. 5\n, we display the best moment tensor solutions for S0235b. On the top, we represent the moment tensor beachballs in a probabilistic formalism with a probability density function (PDF), where we superpose the 20 best solutions on top of each other. On the bottom, the total normalized misfits (equivalent to \u03a61 and \u03a62) are the sums of the different terms (body wave fits and secondary phase amplitudes). The focal mechanisms for S0235b are stable at each depth and also from one depth to another, below 30km. A normal faulting regime is pretty well constrained from 12 to 57km (with mixed strike-slip components at crustal depths), and strike and dip are constant with mean values of 80\u2218 (300\u2218 second nodal plane) and 65\u2218(50\u2218) respectively. Moment tensor results between the two cost function analyses are also very similar. In fact, we note that the moment tensors are a bit unstable in the crust either on the strike or the rake components (as observed on the body wave fits on top of Figs. 3a and 4a. These instabilities are certainly due to the temporal proximity of the depth phases (pP, sS) with the main peak of the body waves in the 20 first kilometers, as already evoked in Brinkman et al. (2021). It might also be explained by the close velocity model discontinuity at 10km and at 24km with the Moho (from Lognonn\u00e9 et al, 2020; Knapmeyer-Endrun et al, 2021).\n\n\n5.3\nResults summary\nAccording to all our results (detailed in the Supplementary materials S1 to S8 for the complete dataset):\n\n\u2022\nThe body waveforms are better constrained on the PZ, PR and ST components, while SZ is difficult to estimate in several cases (e.g., S0235b, S0484b, S0820a, as well as in Brinkman et al. (2021) results on S0173a and S0235b). In fact, the SZ components are contaminated by larger converted receiver phases which do not facilitate the calculations.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe secondary phases are well estimated on PP, SS and SSS, whereas PPP is frequently very weak in amplitude compared to the data for multiple events (e.g. S0407a, S0784a, S0809a). This can be partially attributed to the difficulty of observing PPP in a very small frequency band (Khan et al, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022), but this also applies to PP identification, which are on the contrary better constrained in our computations.\n\n\n\u2022\nMagnitudes are stable in general, recurrently much smaller than those found by the MQS by about 0.5 (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and Table 1), but in agreement with the values of Brinkman et al. (2021) for events S0173a and S0235b. This discrepancy is not fully understood at this time.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn parallel, the Q factor is rather constrained overall. Still, it can converge to the limit values and not stabilize in depth (e.g. S0325a, S0409d, S0784a, S0809a). In this study, Q acts more as a tapering parameter on the spectral shapes and on the \n\nM\nw\n\n evaluations, and does not affect the global geometry of the moment tensor solutions.\n\n\n\u2022\nLastly, we find that synthetic surface waves are about one order of magnitude smaller than the observed data, and we have selected at least 90% of the global dataset solutions with surface wave amplitudes smaller than the InSight data (see S0235b spectra Figs. 3c and 4c. This implies that the Martian noise is high enough to exceed the synthetic surface waves even at 12km. In other words, this finding is very valuable, as it leads to the conclusion that shallow sources at about 12km depth are possible for all the inverted LF\/BB events, despite the fact that there are no clear surface waves in the InSight data.\n\n\n\nWe represent the best moment tensor solutions for every marsquakes at each depth on Fig. 6\n for \u03a61 cost function and on Fig. 7\n for \u03a62 cost function. The majority of \u03a61 solutions have slightly better stability than those of \u03a62 on the same depths, and overall the tensors are in very good agreement between the two cost functions. Similarly to S0235b (Section 5.2) the crustal solutions between 12 and 21km are frequently unstable with a succession of minimum-maximum misfit values (e.g. 18km deep solution of S0173a on Figs. 6 and 7, and in Supplementary material S1). On these Figures, the six events S0173a (detailed in Supplementary material S1), S0235b (Section 5.2), S0409d (Supplementary material S4), S0484b (Supplementary material S5), S0809a (Supplementary material S7) and S0820a (Supplementary material S8) are characterized by normal faulting mechanisms at a majority of depths. S0325a (Supplementary material S2), S0407a (Supplementary material S3) and S0784a (Supplementary material S6) converge to a reverse mechanism. The S0409d, S0484b, S0784a and S0809a beachballs are unstable on several DC components along the depth. In addition, these events are the least resolved at each depth, meaning that multiple solutions resolve the data. The resulting PDFs are not as concentrated as those of the other seven marsquakes.\n\n\n5.4\nBest source solutions\nOn both result Figs. 6 and 7, there is no trend of a minimum misfit for the entire set of events, with one depth standing out. The previous work on Martian moment tensor presented by Brinkman et al. (2021) for events S0173a and S0235b (and S0183a) agrees on depths on the order of 33\u201340km. Also, Drilleau et al (2022) find source depths of 20-35\u00b110km for all the events (except S0820a which is not analyzed in their study), based on depth phase observations. Moreover, the synthetic secondary phases PPP and SSS identified in the data are calculated with the TauP toolkit (Crotwell et al, 1999) on the synthetics up to 40km depth.\nFrom these, in order to remain consistent with data and recent results, we assume that the seismic sources are located at depths between 10 and 40km. We propose to select two \u03a61 solutions for each event; one in the crust between 12 and 24km and the other under the equivalent Martian Moho of the velocity model, between 24km and until the shadow zone depth of synthetic PPP-SSS of about 40km depth. We choose the sets of solutions based on the misfit minimums on \u03a61, and the moment tensor solutions must be similar between \u03a61 and \u03a62.\nWe display on Fig. 8\n the two selected moment tensor solutions for each quake (also highlighted with blue and orange lines on Fig. 6). The figure is separated into two topographic maps gathering the large surface structures of the study area (Knapmeyer et al., 2006); on the left panel we represent the crustal solutions between 12 and 24km deep, and on the right panel we show the solutions between 24 and 39km deep. Each moment tensor solution is located at the epicenter of the event, i.e. at the center of the ellipsoid (visible on Fig. 1). In parallel, the Table 3\n summarizes the set of output parameters associated with each solution, specifying the type of the dominant focal mechanism, the depth of the source, the three angles of the strike, dip, and rake, and the calculated magnitude \n\nM\nw\n\n and attenuation factors of Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n.\nAnalyzing the selected solutions on both Fig. 8 and Table 3, we first observe that S0173a, S0235b and S0820a marsquakes are in the normal dominant regime (mixed with strike-slip components for S0409d and S0484b), on the other hand, S0325a, S0407a and S0784a display clear reverse regime. Lastly, the dominant regime of S0809a is not obvious because its rake is unstable, either reverse in the crust, or normal at higher depths.\nThe majority of the selected sources are located at 18 and 30km depths. The depth values of our results for S0173a, S0235b, S0325a, S0409d, S0484b and S0809a are very close to those obtained in Drilleau et al (2022) from pP and sS depth phase analyses. The S0173a solution at 36km depth and the S0235b\u2019 33km solution are very similar to the depths of \u223c 30\u201335km from Brinkman et al. (2021).\nEvents S0173a, S0235b, S0407a, S0484b and S0820a have stable and similar strike angles oriented towards E-W\/NW-SE. The thrust fault mechanisms of S0325a, S0407a and S0784a are also oriented E-W globally, but with less similarities between them as they are not located in the same area.\nThe dip angle is remarkably similar for the nine marsquakes, with high values of 70\u201380\u2218 on their first nodal plane. Excepted in the cases of S0235b and S0484b, the dip angles are asymmetrical between the first and the auxiliary nodal planes, the second plane being much less inclined (values approximately between 10 and 40\u2218).\nThe rake angle varies significantly between events, with values ranging from \u221276\u2218 (S0173a) to \u2212115\u2218 (S0820a) for normal events, and from 67\u2218 (S0784a) to 132\u2218 (S0784a) for reverse ones. S0809a is peculiar and its rake at 15km depth is mixed between right-strike-slip and thrust motion, while it is more clearly converging towards normal motion at 30km depth.\nThe magnitude ranges between 2.17 (S0409d) and 3.24 (S0325a) with a majority of values around \u223c 2.7. For all the events, the magnitude increases by about 0.2 at depth. The values are much lower than the MQS estimates including errors (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and Table 1) to within 0.5, especially S0409d magnitude values which are more than 0.8 weaker than the MQS \n\nM\nw\n\n values of 3.2 \u00b1 0.2. Besides, the \n\nM\nw\n\n of 2.92-3.21 of S0173a and S0235b are very close to the estimates of 3.0 and 3.1 respectively calculated by Brinkman et al. (2021).\nFinally, the best solution quality factors Q\n\nP\n and Q\n\nS\n are not easily interpretable. Still, from our results, we observe the Q\n\nS\n factor being mainly between \u223c350 and 500 (Q\n\nP\n between \u223c800 and 1200), overestimated compared to the values from Giardini et al (2020), where the Q\n\nS\n is of 300\u2013320 for S0173a, S0235b and S0325a, but in agreement with the values imposed in Brinkman et al. (2021). The solutions of Q\n\nS\n for S0235b and S0325a (30km solution) are in good agreement with their study, as well as S0407a, S0484b (27km solution), S0809a (15km solution) and S0820a. The Q of S0173a is unconstrained and tends towards higher boundary at the two selected depths. Moreover, the values of Q can affect the \n\nM\nw\n\n estimates, i.e. large Q factors result in underestimation of \n\nM\nw\n\n.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussions\nWe have selected two moment tensor solutions for the nine inverted marsquakes. In this section, the solutions are interpreted in relation to the structures and the geological context of the region. We first highlight the different uncertainties and limitations of our inversion approach. Then we describe the generic structures of interest in the area. Finally, we make a more precise analysis on regions close to the epicenters, thus exploring several possibilities on the origin of the marsquakes.\n\n6.1\nInversion limitations\nIn this study, we face difficulties coming from the numerous uncertainties and unknowns on Mars and due to the quality of data (single seismic station framework).\nFrom the velocity model used to compute synthetic seismograms, we made the hypothesis that the crustal structure defined for the vicinity of the InSight station, recovered in Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021) from receiver function and auto-correlation approaches, is the same at the nine epicenters, which are situated 1000\u20132000km away. In the same way, the 1D structure assumption implies that there is no lateral velocity (or density) heterogeneities and no variations of the Martian Moho depth (e.g. 24km in the used model versus 35\u201340km in the Cerberus region, from Parro et al, 2017 or Plesa et al, 2018). This inference is even more problematic for the event S0325a located on the Martian dichotomy. To address this issue, we invert an earthquake located in Australia with Martian synthetics (see Supplementary material S9) to show the non-dependence of the geometry of the moment tensors with the internal model. We also invert S0235b with the secondary crustal model from Knapmeyer-Endrun et al (2021), with a 3rd layer at 43km (in Supplementary material S11). The moment tensor solutions of the Australian earthquake are very consistent with those calculated by the USGS (Guy et al, 2015) and the GFZ (Quinteros et al, 2021), and show good stability at depth. However, the magnitude (too small) and the quality factors (too high) are unconstrained due to their dependencies towards the velocity model. At the same time, the moment tensor results of the S0235b sensitivity test with 3-layered TAYAK model are quite similar to those of the 2-layered model (results in Section 5.2) but are less clearly extensive and are less stable over the full depth ranges. An accurate 3D model (that are recently being proposed, for example in Plesa et al., 2021) associated with 3D synthetics, or failing that, a model at the source location, would account better for the complexity of the internal structure.\nWe also have uncertainties on the localization of the marsquakes (distance and BAZ). Currently, the distance of the marsquakes is known to within approximately 5\u2218 (\u223c 300km) uncertainties. In our methodology, we select separately the seismic phase windows, hence we can get rid of their relative arrival times controlled by the epicentral distance. Although, the synthetic amplitudes are directly dependent of the distance, and directly linked to the \n\nM\nw\n\n and Q evaluations. Moreover, the sensitivity test on the BAZ (Supplementary material S10) demonstrates good stability overall. Yet, we note some differences in the moment tensor dip angles, with those of the nominal inversion of S0235b (in Section 5.2).\nIn addition, the uncertainty about the Martian structure is not only limited to layer geometry and heterogeneities but also to key parameters such as the attenuation (or 1\/Q). It controls the marsquake frequency content and the signal amplitude, and it is still not well understood and estimated for Mars. That is why in our approach it is one of the explored parameters, mainly used to adjust the fits of the body waves. But we are not able to find an emerging value for the nine marsquakes, and for instance in the case of S0325a (Supplementary material S2), the Q exploration tends towards the upper boundary. Its refinement would certainly allow to obtain optimal fits and a better estimate of the moment magnitude, as well as stress drop and fault size scales.\nFinally, regarding the seismo-tectonic analyses that we make below, we are on a fairly well covered area both by satellite imagery and by scientific studies of recent years. However many structures are still poorly observed (for instance Al Qahira Vallis and Avernus Dorsa, see Figs. 1 and 9\n and Section 6 below), and we lack field data to refine the remote morphological observations. A closer temporal monitoring between images of the same area (on the order of a day) would be also very useful to detect surface movements,e.g. landslides or boulders possibly related to the seismicity.\nHowever, despite these difficulties, we have several studies that converge on the same results, using different approaches. Moreover, we are fortunate to have sufficiently high resolution images to look at the main structures. We are thus able to link our results to satellite observations.\n\n\n6.2\nSeismogenic sources\nThe most visible structures of the central Elysium Planitia region are fractures and faults, ranging from a few tens of kilometers to several hundred kilometers long. On all of our maps (Figs. 1 and 8) from Knapmeyer et al. (2006) data, two main modes of deformation are observed, extension (red lines) which is dominant in the region, and compression (black lines).\nNotable extensional structures near the marsquakes are: the Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems, Elysium Fossae further north and Al Qahira Vallis at the dichotomy (Fig. 1). Cerberus fossae is suggested to have had tectonic activity as recently as 10Ma (Vaucher et al, 2009; Taylor et al, 2013), and of a few Ma for Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Hartmann and Neukum, 2001). Elysium Fossae activity is thought to be older, estimated at 200\u2013500Ma (Vaucher et al, 2009). Al Qahira Vallis is an ancient valley with several hundred million years of activity, between the last 2 Ga and 700Ma ago (Cabrol et al, 1998).\nThe largest observed compressive structure in our area is located at Tartarus Montes. It is a large ridge whose formation predates that of Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Hamilton et al, 2010). All other compressive features of the region are of more moderate size and are mostly wrinkle ridges (for example, black lines in Avernus Dorsa). The wrinkle ridges are the result of lithospheric flexure and located at the apex of reverse faults at depth (Banerdt et al, 1982; Head et al, 2002).\n\n\n6.3\nCerberus fossae: a major fracture zone in Elysium Planitia\nIn the study area on Figs. 1 and 8, Cerberus fossae is the largest structure, and is associated with the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system further north. These two sub-parallel fracture zones are trending N100-110\u2218E. They are good candidates as the source of the seismic events, suggesting an ongoing localized activity on Mars. From our results on Fig. 8 and Table 3, the seismic events S0173a, S0235b, S0409d, S0484b, S0809a and S0820a are associated to extensional moment tensors compatible with Cerberus extensive motion, while S0407a depicts reverse tensors and S0809a is both reverse (crust) and normal (deeper). Given the locations and diversity of the focal mechanism solutions, it is more likely that there are multiple seismic sources generating the seven marsquakes.\nIn more detail, the recent tectonic activity in this region could result from several processes involving thermal contraction and\/or indirect volcanism. Recent volcanism in the last million years in the center parts of Cerberus fossae has been proposed by Horvath et al (2021) as recent as 50ka. Moreover, some small amplitude and long duration LF events located on Cerberus fossae have been suggested as potential slow seismic events by Kedar et al. (2021). The existence of these slow marsquakes could imply that a seismic source by volcanism exists in Elysium Planitia. More recently, small events possibly associated with S0173a and S0235b have been proposed to be related to volcanic activity in the upper mantle by Sun and Tkal\u010di\u0107 (2022). There is no direct evidence from gravimetric data that a mantle plume lies beneath Elysium Mons, whereas, a positive Bouguer anomaly of 100mGal (about \u2212100mGal on the surrounding terrains) is visible near Avernus Dorsa (Genova et al, 2016, and see Figure in Supplementary material S12), possibly testifying to a less dense crustal mass, for example of magmatic origin. Besides, the infrared imagery from THEMIS data (Fergason et al, 2006) does not show localized hotspots along Cerberus Fossae faults, suggesting that there is currently little or no thermal anomaly related to a surficial magmatic flow. Thus, a shallow magmatic source is unlikely, but it is possible that a magma flow at depths exists (Kedar et al., 2021; Sun and Tkal\u010di\u0107, 2022).\nOn the other hand, the seismicity could rather be related to ancient dike networks at depth (\u2248 5\u201320km), as it is expected that they are radially distributed around the Elysium Mons volcano (Ernst et al, 2001). Despite the fact that Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles are located more than 1000km east of the volcano, Ernst et al (2001) concluded on networks that may extend over distances of the order of more than 2000km. Thus, these massive dikes are suggested to propagate under Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems, and are likely responsible for the graben subsidence (Vetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). Rivas-Dorado et al (2021) analyzed the graben widths, lengths and topographic data, and inferred the relationships between dike depths and graben widths.They estimate that dikes can expand to depths from 5 \u2013 20km in the case of Elysium Fossae. We assume a similar configuration on the dike depths for Cerberus Fossae, as the graben widths are comparable with those of Elysium Fossae (Taylor et al, 2013; Perrin et al, 2022). The formation and propagation of dikes in depth is thus likely related to mechanical weakness and the creation\/reactivation of adjacent sub-parallel fractures. It is therefore proposed that buried fractures exist below the graben systems, in the same geometry. In addition, the dip angles of the seven marsquakes are of the order of 60 to 80\u2218 (Table 1), thus sub-vertical, and more consistent with underlying extensional fractures. We also find most of our best moment tensor solutions around 18km deep for all of the inverted masquakes (Fig. 8). Although these depths are on the same scale as the lower dike tips at 20km of Rivas-Dorado et al (2021), it is unclear to relate our results directly to the movements generated by the grabens located at the top of the dikes, on the first kilometers. We note that S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a are well aligned together (mainly NW-SE oriented) and very close to the general direction of the Cerberus fossae grabens. Thus, we suppose that these marsquakes are indirectly associated to the Cerberus fossae tectonics, and instead originated from the reactivation of deep extensive fractures, resulting from dike emplacement. In the case of S0809a at 15 km depth, the moment tensor solution has mixed components of reverse and strike-slip while having comparable strike and dip angles with the 30 km deep solution. Therefore, to explain this, we suppose that a network of compressive fractures also exists, and accommodates the mainly extensive deformation of the dikes. But alternatively, the solutions may simply be unresolved, knowing that the crustal mechanisms of S0809a are otherwise not very stable (see Fig. 6 and Supplementary S7), in which case the extensive solution at 30 km depth would be favored.\nFrom the mapping of Knapmeyer et al. (2006) (Figs. 1 and 8), there are no major compressive structures recorded at the ellipsoid of S0407a, and very few in the vicinity of Cerberus fossae fractures. The 18km solution (NE-SW, with a small dip angle) is not obviously coherent with Cerberus fossae configuration, while the 36km depth solution is in strong agreement with the system geometry (on both strike and dip angles). We thus propose that S0407a could be generated by buried thrust faults sub-parallel to Cerberus fossae. It is also possible that, given the location and tensor geometry of this event, it could be a reactivation by thermal contraction of the Cerberus fossae faults in reverse regime.\nTo the same extent, S0235b and S0484b are consistent with the geometry and tectonic activity of Cerberus fossae. Although, their epicenters are not located on Cerberus fossae, but are closer to the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system. Thus, we can not clearly rule out one or the other system as a source for these marsquakes (see discussions in Section 6.4.1 below).\n\n\n6.4\nAnalyses of other nearby seismic sources\nEven though Cerberus fossae is clearly the largest structure in the region shown in Fig. 8, the nine seismic events are not all located on the fractures and\/or their solutions are not all compatible with the graben geometry. In addition, the ellipsoids are the representations of the probability of the location of marsquakes with the epicenter being the highest probability, but the areas covered are broad (about 60,000\u2013200,000km2 per event) and include several other major and moderate structures (as seen on Fig. 1). The sensitivity test results on the BAZ in Supplementary S11 demonstrate the robustness of the moment tensor solutions. Hence, we explore the remarkable structural features covered by the ellipsoids and investigate the possible other scenarios that would explain the source of the most distant marsquakes.\nFor this reason, we regroup on Fig. 9 three areas of interest of four marsquakes (see also insets referenced in Fig. 8), with their associated best moment tensor solutions and ellipsoid imprints: the S0235b and S0484b events along the Grjot\u00e1 Valles (Fig. 9a and detailed in Section 6.4.1), the S0784a event along the Avernus Dorsa wrinkles (Fig. 9b and Section 6.4.2), and the S0325a event at the dichotomy (Fig. 9c and Section 6.4.3).\n\n6.4.1\nS0235b and S0484b: Grjot\u00e1 Valles and Tartarus Montes region\nIn the cases of S0484b and S0235b, the ellipsoids are centered mainly on the Grjot\u00e1 Valles system, north of Cerberus fossae (Figs. 1 and 9a). The Grjot\u00e1 Valles grabens (shown in thick red lines) are proposed to be contemporary with the Cerberus fossae fractures (Vaucher et al, 2009; Brown and Roberts, 2019) because they intersect the same lava plains and flow channels. The system of Grjot\u00e1 Valles has the same general orientation of N110\u2218E and is radially oriented with respect to Elysium Mons. Thus, the Grjot\u00e1 Valles and Cerberus fossae grabens most likely originate from the same processes, i.e. they would be the surface expression of underlying dikes (Ernst et al, 2001; Brown and Roberts, 2019). In addition, the fractures intersect knobby terrains of the Noachian-early Hesperian (4.1-3.5 Ga, Hartmann and Neukum, 2001; Plescia, 2003; Vaucher et al, 2009) of the Tartarus Montes formation. Despite unlikely recent activity (Hamilton et al, 2010), the major compressive Tartarus volcanic ridge (solid black lines trending N60\u2218E on Fig. 9a, has certainly enabled shallow fracturation in the region. We also observe a few minor N-S trending compressive structures of 20\u201350km long that could be reactivated (thin black lines).\nGiven the normal fault solutions of the moment tensors selected for S0235b-S0484b (Fig. 8), we favor a seismic source located on either one of the Cerberus or Grjot\u00e1 grabens. Especially, the S0235b strike angles of \u223c300\u2218 and of \u223c110\u2218 for S0484b solutions match very well with the overall graben directions of the two regions. As developed before in the case of Cerberus Fossae events, the seismic sources are more probably linked to internal weakening, oriented and aligned with Grjot\u00e1 fractures, and without clear surficial imprints. The retained depths of S0235b are slightly higher than those of S0484b (33 and 27km respectively) as well as the higher value of \n\nM\nw\n\n of 2.9-3.2 versus 2.4-2.6 respectively. These inferences suggest that S0235b is associated with a larger and deeper structure than S0484b. Besides, the depths of these two events are too high to be related to a dike, but are more consistent with deep fractures or faults. This is also supported by their large dip angles of 60\u2212\u221270\u2218, coherent with sub-vertical buried fractures. The lower dip angles of S0235b and S0484b (49\u201363\u2218) at 33\u201327km depth respectively, might suggest that the faults become slightly more listric at depth. We also note that the 21km deep focal mechanism of S0484b has a large strike-slip component, which could imply an interaction between the extensional component at Grjot\u00e1 Valles and the transpressive inherited NE-SW structures at Tartarus Montes (Fig. 9a). But this hypothesis would need further work, i.e. detailed observations on the morphology and geology of the area, to understand such complex interactions.\nFurther north of the S0484b ellipsoid (on top of Fig. 1), the Elysium Fossae graben is unconsidered as a primary seismic source due to an activity dated anterior to 200Ma at most (Vaucher et al, 2009) and due to its location. In addition, we do not observe any particular extensive structure crossing the lava plains at the southern end of the S0484b ellipsoid (shared with the upper part of the S0784a ellipsoid, see the discussion below and Fig. 9b).\n\n\n6.4.2\nS0784a: Avernus dorsa ridges\nThe northern part of the S0784a ellipsoid (observable on the upper part of the Fig. 9b) is located on a broad volcanic plain of Elysium Planitia composed of Late Amazonian lavas (several hundreds of ka, Tanaka et al, 2011). On the mapping of Knapmeyer et al. (2006) on Figs. 1 and 8, we do not notice any surface fractures in these plains. However, gravimetric analyses (Genova et al, 2016) of the area shows that a positive Bouguer anomaly (300mGal versus 0mGal in the surrounding terrains, see figure in Supplementary material S12) exists at the northern end of the ellipsoid of S0784a, indicating a potential excess of crustal mass of a size of about 100km which is not reflected in the topography. The mass excess is compatible with an upwelling of a denser mantle material, also compatible to a shallow dike activity, and supports a potential hidden activity below the lava deposits. But, even if the S0784a epicenter is located on these lava plains, the lack of information on a potential buried structure prevents us from favoring a source in these surroundings.\nIn addition, we observe a chaotic fracture network on the west outside of the event ellipsoid, mainly with moderate extensive fractures (red lines on Fig. 9b) of 10\u201350km long without any preferential orientation. These extensive fractures could be subjected to compressive reactivation by the planetary thermal contraction. The S0784a solutions may be compatible with the E-W orientation of these chaotic fractures, although they are too distant (\u223c 400km from epicenter) and principally extensive.\nBesides, in Fig. 9b we show the main structures of the southern part of the ellipsoid. In the center of the figure, we highlight the sub-parallel wrinkle ridges of Avernus Dorsa trending NNE-SSW and dated late Noachian-early Hesperian (about 3.5 Ga, Tanaka et al, 2011). As the generic Martian wrinkle ridges, they are associated to regional shortening, and from mixed process between the regional volcanic strains (Watters, 1993; Mangold et al, 2000) and the brittle lithosphere contrast between Martian highlands and lowlands (Frey et al, 2002).\nThe solutions we compute for S0784a marsquake are mainly reverse (Fig. 8 and Table 3). The two solutions at 15km and 33 depths are oriented E-W. Despite the fact that the reverse motion, the dip angles and depths of S0784a are in agreement with the wrinkle ridge geometries, the general E-W orientation of our two solutions is not in line with the NNE-SSW orientation of Avernus Dorsa traces. In contrast, S0784a is close to the dichotomy, and our solutions are oriented perpendicular to the southern highlands. At this transition zone, structures and cracks are also aligned with the dichotomy boundary, some of them are normal, and would have allowed the ancient subsidence of the lowlands (Maxwell and McGill, 1988; Smrekar et al, 2004). Thus, this deformation transmitted from the southern highlands in Terra Cimmeria to the northern lowlands of Elysium Planitia could have generated large crustal weaknesses and faulting (Frey et al, 2002; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020). It is therefore suspected that E-W oriented fractures, without surface expression, may exist in these deformed terrains. Thus, we propose that event S0784a may have been generated by a deep fault, parallel to the dichotomy and in a compressive regime, reactivated by the stresses associated with planetary contraction.\n\n\n6.4.3\nS0325a: The dichotomy region\nIn Fig. 9c, we identify the structures located in the center of the S0325a ellipsoid, within the cratered Terra Cimmeria terrains of Noachian age (about 4 Ga, Tanaka et al, 2011). The terrains are very old and cratered, and the wrinkle ridges present in the area intersect them. The relative chronology suggests that more recent activity is possible in this area, although highly uncertain and in the last 4 Ga.\nOn the northern end of the ellipsoid (Figs. 1 and 8) most of the deformation compiled by Knapmeyer et al. (2006) is extensional, and the fractures are weakly marked and of a few tens of kilometers long. The southern limit of the S0325a ellipsoid (Fig. 1) is adjacent to a small network of compressive fractures of variable orientations (note also that a large crack of about 50km in an extensive regime oriented NE-SW has been mapped close to the southern end of the S0325a ellipsoid on Fig. 1 and compiled in Knapmeyer et al. (2006), but we consider this trace as erratic, as it is not corresponding to any clear surface expression). The center of S0325a ellipsoid is located 100km east from a major structure, Al Qahira Vallis (Figs. 1 and 9c) which is an ancient valley oriented NNE-SSW. This structure is suggested to have been active between 700Ma-2 Ga ago (Cabrol et al, 1998) and related to regional catastrophic overflow of a paleolake (Irwin et al, 2004). The general orientation of Al Qahira Vallis is rather N\u2013S, but could be in agreement with the solutions of S0325a whose strike are of \u223c 20\u201340\u2218 (Table 3). Although, the moment tensors of S0325a are mostly reverse whereas Al Qahira is a graben structure. In addition, the valley is located too far from the ellipsoid to be directly involved in this event. However, it is possible that the extension of Al Qahira Vallis generated other adjacent fractures closer to the ellipsoid. But without more information we cannot relate this major structure to S0325a with confidence.\nOn the other hand, in the center area of Fig. 9c inside the ellipsoid, we observe several wrinkle ridges (and a few small extensive fractures) oriented NNE-SSW\/NE-SW and of the order of 50km in length. The thermal contraction is supposed to be the main process at the origin of these contractional features.\nThe two S0325a moment tensors solutions at 18 and 30km depths, are oriented NNE-SSW, with low to high dip angles (from 27\u201336\u2218 to 58\u201381\u2218) and depict a reverse regime (Figs. 8 and 9c), consistent with most of the compressive features of this area. The 18 and 30km solution depths are large, relative to the assumed depths of 1 to 10km of the thrust faults beneath the wrinkle ridges (Mangold et al, 1998; Schultz, 2000; Watters, 2004). But still, the geometry of wrinkle ridges is quite complex, and several studies actually mention crustal or lithospheric depths for wrinkle ridge fault rooting, depending on the brittle-ductile transition (Golombek et al, 2001; Mont\u00e9si and Zuber, 2003; Andrews-Hanna, 2020). Moreover, in Andrews-Hanna (2020), the tectonic modeling of wrinkle ridge morphology shows that additional faults are nucleated adjacent to the main blind thrust fault (dip angles of 20\u201370\u2218 up to 20km depth), which can be rooted to depths up to 30km beneath the ridges where it is listric (dip angles of 15\u201340\u2218). The solutions on the dips, rakes and depths of S0325a event, are then consistent with wrinkle ridge geometries. On the other hand, we consider that S0325a tensors are the least stable of our dataset, the two solutions are very different from each other, and that the crustal model does not include the heterogeneities of the dichotomy highlands. In order to properly account for these limitations, we conclude that S0325a was generated by a reverse fault at depth reactivated by thermal contraction, and the fault could either be located under a wrinkle ridge, or merely be the result of the large regional deformation without surface expression.\n\n\n\n\n7\nConclusion\nInSight single seismic station on Mars requires inversion approaches specifically adapted to Martian data. We have thus developed a method of inversion of seismic moment tensors and applied it for nine marsquakes, to identify the probable seismic sources at their origin. For this purpose, we inverted the waveforms of the body waves P and S, and the amplitudes of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS. We also selected the solutions with weak synthetic surface waves, below the Martian noise level as they are not observed in the InSight data. The considered marsquakes are comparable to tectonic earthquakes and characterized by high SNR and magnitude values of \u223c3. In addition, they are all located in the Elysium Planitia region and a majority of them are located on the Cerberus fossae system (from both MQS estimations by InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021 and by Drilleau et al, 2022).\nThe depth of the InSight events is an uncertain parameter and the current estimated values are notably between about 20 and 50km (see Brinkman et al., 2021; Drilleau et al., 2022). Our results showed that it is possible to resolve the focal mechanisms in a stable manner along multiple depths for our entire dataset. In particular, we demonstrated for all events that there are the majority of the synthetic solutions that are compatible with the data surface wave amplitudes. More precisely, we found that the synthetic surface waves are an order of magnitude smaller than the Martian noise even at 12km depth. Thus, this important result highlights the fact that seismic events can be shallow despite the absence of surface wave detection in the data. The depths of the events must also be consistent with the maximum detection depth of the secondary phases PP, SS, PPP and SSS in the synthetics, also identified in the seismic data (for instance in Khan et al, 2021; Drilleau et al, 2022). Therefore, we identified two solutions for each event; a first crustal solution between 12 and 24km depth, and a second solution between 24 and 39km depth. The two solutions were then related to the observations and geological knowledge of the region. We have identified several potential structures at the origin of the seismic events; the extensive Cerberus fossae and Grjot\u00e1 Valles systems have been formed by deep massive dike networks (Ernst et al, 2001; Vetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Perrin et al, 2022) coupled with crustal weakening; the Martian wrinkle ridges, in particular those at Avernus Dorsa and Terra Cimmeria, are originated by the thermal contraction of the planet and are located at the apex of reverse faults at depth (Banerdt et al, 1982; Head et al, 2002); possible deep fractures without surface expression, related to the deformation of the dichotomy, from highlands to lowlands (Frey et al, 2002; Golombek et al, 2018; Pan et al, 2020).\nWe observed a majority of best moment tensor solutions that are at depths 18km and 30km for the nine marsquakes. Seven seismic events located on Cerberus fossae are in the same orientation (NE-SW) and with very steep nodal planes (60\u201380\u2218). From our comparisons between morphology and moment tensor geometries, we concluded that S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a, which display normal faulting moment tensors, are presumably generated by subsurface normal faults, sub-parallel to the underlying dikes and to the grabens of Cerberus fossae. S0235b and S0484b, further north, are also extensive, and also related to the same seismic source type, i.e. related to normal fractures under Grjot\u00e1 Valles certainly linked to dike propagations. Moreover, our results for events S0173a and S0235b are in good agreement with those presented in the companion paper by Brinkman et al. (2021). We both found extensive solutions for these events at similar depths of about 30\u201335km. S0407a is reverse and likely result from the same faulting processes as those of S0173a, S0409d, S0809a and S0820a as the epicenters are close, but in a compressive context. S0784a is located on south lava plains, and its moment tensors in reverse regime are probably associated to a thrust fault below Avernus Dorsa, sub-parallel to the Martian dichotomy boundary. S0325a, the most distant event located on the dichotomy, is mainly reverse and possibly generated by compressive fractures related to the thermal contraction of the very old southern terrains. Our magnitude estimates are smaller than the MQS values (InSight Marsquake and Service, 2021) by a factor of \u223c0.5 for the nine marsquakes, while we agree with Brinkman et al. (2021) on their \n\nM\nw\n\n estimations for S0173a and S0235b. Lastly, we also evaluated the quality factor Q which is not accurately known for Mars, however this parameter is the least constrained in this study and we could not deduce a value with confidence.\nThe InSight mission has been extended to the end of 2022. This would eventually lead to the detection of additional marsquakes in the vicinity of Elysium Planitia. An analysis on these new events would help to better understand the potential seismic sources, and how they can interact with each other. In addition, this work could be improved by addressing and resolving the main limitations we have mentioned. In particular, the structure models could be refined to take into account the lateral heterogeneities (mainly the depth of the Moho and the attenuation pattern) between the events and the landing site. And finally, continuous remote observations on structures (before and after quakes), for example from very high resolution HiRISE (McEwen et al, 2007) or CTX (Malin et al, 2007) images, would be very interesting to detect potential landslides related to marsquakes.\n\n","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe elastic rebound theory (Reid, 1910), mathematically described by Ohnaka (1976), assumes that faults obey regular patterns of behavior. This idea, which is based on the assumptions of characteristic earthquakes (e.g., Aki, 1984; Schwartz and Coppersmith, 1984) inherently backgrounds the work of earthquake research and forecasting since the 20th century. In some cases, the assumption underlying this hypothesis, at the base of predictions of maximum magnitudes of individual large events used to produce probabilistic hazard maps, is that faults are \u201cpredictable\u201d in the sense that they tend to rupture with the same size and mechanism (e.g. Kammerer and Ake, 2012) and that big earthquakes are most likely to strike in seismic gaps. These concepts are implicitly time-dependent and practically led to estimations of maximum magnitudes mainly based on past seismicity (Atkinson, 2004) from catalogs that are incomplete by definition (e.g., Mohammed et al., 2014; Wyss, 2015). This approach is very diffuse worldwide for the preparation of official hazard maps (e.g., the SESAME for Mediterranean basin - Jimenez et al., 2001; The United States national seismic hazard model \u2013 Petersen et al., 2015; the New Zealand national Seismic Hazard Model \u2013 Stirling et al., 2012). Hybrid approaches to estimate the maximum magnitude were proposed in order to bypass the limited time-span of seismic catalogs selecting the larger magnitude between that reported in the seismic record and that derived from fault dimension through empirical relationships (e.g., the European Seismic Hazard Model ESHM13 \u2013 Woessner et al., 2015; the Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 - Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021). In the Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources of Italy (DISS Working Group, 2021) and the European Database of Seismogenic Sources (Basili et al., 2013) maximum magnitude values proposed in the literature from detailed studies are also integrated. However, due to earthquakes' long recurrence times, these approaches may fail to consider largest magnitude events for a given location because not yet observed, hence producing underestimation of the resulting hazard (Scholz, 2019). This typically applies to regions uninhabited during historical times and now densely populated or where the recurrence time of strong earthquakes is much longer than the onset of the seismological record (Trippetta et al., 2019 and references therein). In fact, seismologists often face with the occurrence of unexpected (or uncharacteristic; Geller et al., 2015 and references therein) earthquakes that highlight the incompleteness of these approaches, which often fail (see Wyss, 2015) to predict both earthquakes magnitude, peak ground acceleration and recurrence interval (e.g., Tohoku 2011 Mw 9 instead of the predicted Mw 7.5 characteristic earthquake; Italy 2012 Mw 6.1 produced up to 0.3\u00a0g of ground acceleration instead of 0.125\u20130.150\u00a0g - 10% in 50 yrs - predicted by the official seismic hazard model; Parkfield earthquake expected at 95% probability before 1993 occurred in 2004 with ambiguities in location and characteristics with respect of what it was predicted). Moreover the concept of Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) has also been introduced, which is based on seismic history and seismotectonics and is a basic ingredient for a neodeterministic technique (NDSHA) to calculate the seismic hazard (e.g., Panza and Bela, 2020).\nTo avoid the problem of time-dependence, the maximum magnitude of earthquakes can be assessed using empirical scaling relationships that relate active faults characteristics (generally fault length and\/or fault slip) to the maximum magnitude expected in case of the rupture of the whole length of that fault (Wells and Coppersmith, 1994; Mai and Beroza, 2000; Leonard, 2010, 2014; Thingbaijam et al., 2017; Schirripa Spagnolo et al., 2021). In this latter case a big problem is the uncertainty in source characterization (e.g., Schwartz, 2018). Criteria for selection of active faults are even more markedly subjective. Further, where strain rates are low to intermediate and faults are small in dimensions and unclear in surface expression of recent activity, the connection between faults and earthquakes is not straightforward (Trippetta et al., 2019).\nHere, we propose a model for an alternative methodology to calculate the maximum magnitude expected for a region. The method is based on an invariant (on human time-scales) characteristic of the system, that is the available brittle volume, thus providing the maximum possible magnitude (i.e. the upper energy limit). This way may overcome the incompleteness of the seismic catalogs and the uncertainty in source characterization, since the effective potential is unrelated to the dimension of the faults (see Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2015, 2018, 2019). The maximum magnitude is calculated at each node of a 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km regular grid covering the study area and is strictly time-independent with recurrence related to strain rates. The present study integrates and extends findings of previous papers where the model was preliminary applied to extensional areas (Petricca et al., 2015) and compressional areas (Petricca et al., 2019) of Italy. In this new version we propose a map of maximum possible magnitudes that covers all the kinematic regions of Italy (i.e. with extension, compression and strike-slip tectonics). Since our map provides a first estimate of the maximum magnitude, we preferred to investigate only well-constrained tectonic regions. Therefore we excluded Sardinia and Apulia, aware that these areas are potentially seismic due to the presence of faults with recent tectonic activity (see, for Sardinia, Casula et al., 2001; for Apulia Argnani et al., 2001) and moderate earthquakes in historical record with Mw ~5 (e.g. south Sardegna 1616; Rovida et al., 2021) or even Mw >6 (e.g., Salento-Apulia 1743; Galli and Naso, 2008; Nappi et al., 2017). Small geodetic rates for these regions (<1\u00a0mm\/yr; Devoti et al., 2017; Farolfi and Del Ventisette, 2017) imply that the recurrence interval of large events would be very large. Our map is a step forward with respect to previous works because it relies: 1) on a brittle-ductile transition depth (BDT) map updated with respect to that proposed in Petricca et al. (2015), that is the basis for brittle volumes estimation in extensional and strike-slip areas; 2) an updated version - with respect to that proposed in Petricca et al. (2019) - of the map of the thrusts decollement depth necessary for calculation of brittle volumes in compressional areas; 3) a more recent solution for GPS record (Devoti et al., 2017) used to compute the BDT depth and to define the annual rates of strain.\nThe map of the maximum possible magnitude of Italy is then i) compared with maximum magnitudes used to produce the Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 (Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021), and then ii) tested versus the geodetic strain rate with the scope of delimiting areas of maximum probability for next moderate\/large earthquakes occurrence.\n\n\n2\nSeismotectonics of Italy\nItaly is located along a complex plate boundary where at least three main plates (Eurasia, Africa and Adria) interact (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012). Recorded earthquakes allow the recognition of extensional, compressional and transcurrent stress fields (Fig. 1\n). The coexistence of these different tectonic regimes is the result of active subduction processes building up two mountain chains (Alps and the Apennines) and producing the Apennines back-arc extension (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986). The Alps (characterized by double vergence and high elevation) and the Apennines (verging mostly eastward) belts grew on top of subduction zones characterized by slab hinges converging and diverging relative to the upper plates, respectively. The rates of motion at the surface from GPS data are in the order of a few mm\/yr (Devoti et al., 2017). Contractional deformation concentrates along the front of the Southern Apennines, the eastward offshore of Calabria, the south Tyrrhenian Basin and, mainly, along the central-northern Adriatic margins and between the Northern Apennines and the Southern Alps (Fig. 1). To the west of the active Apennines accretionary prism, the Apennines are characterized by extensional tectonics. Here, previous contractional structures (thrust faults and folds) are crosscut by active normal faults (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012). In the frontal accretionary prism and in the backarc basin, strike-slip faults mostly play a subsidiary role of transfer zones, whereas in the foreland, lithospheric transcurrent faults act as tear zones accommodating differential slab retreat in areas where strong earthquakes may occur (e.g., the Gargano and the Malta escarpment areas).\nHistorical and instrumental catalogs show a dense distribution of seismicity in Italy (Fig. 1), that has been struck by numerous moderate to strong earthquakes (Rovida et al., 2021). The most energetic earthquakes (Fig. 1) are concentrated along the extensional ridge of the Apennines where Mw exceeding 6 are frequent (e.g., Colfiorito 1997, Mw 6.0 - Amato et al., 1998; Norcia 2016 Mw 6.5 and Amatrice 2016 Mw 6.0 - Chiaraluce et al., 2017; L'Aquila 2009, Mw 6.3 -Chiarabba et al., 2009; Irpinia 1980, Mw 6.8 - Rovida et al., 2021). Large thrust earthquakes, though less numerous, were recorded in the eastern Alps (Friuli earthquake with Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.4 in 1976 - Caputo, 1976) and, possibly, in the Po Plain (1117, with Mw 6.5, although fault kinematics is not constrained - Guidoboni et al., 2005; 2012 with Mw 6.1 - Govoni et al., 2014). Although its focal mechanism remains unknown, the largest historical earthquake ever recorded in Italy has struck southeastern Sicily in 1693 (M 7.3 - https:\/\/emidius.mi.ingv.it\/CPTI15-DBMI15).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\nThe proposed procedure for the evaluation of the maximum possible magnitude, here applied to the Italian region, foresees that, via available geological and geophysical data, we define: 1) the extent of areas characterized by compressional, extensional and strike-slip tectonics; 2) the relationship between length of possible ruptures (Lf) for seismogenic faults and the maximum faulting depth (zmax) of related earthquakes - that varies from Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a02 to Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a025 depending on the tectonic regime and on the strain rate (Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2018; Petricca et al., 2019); 3) the maps of the active thrust decollement depth (for compressional area; Petricca et al., 2019 and this study; Table S1) and brittle-ductile transition depth (BDT for extensional and strike-slip areas; Petricca et al., 2015 and this study; Table S2). In fact, normal fault ruptures can propagate through the entire seismogenic crust, whereas thrusts frequently flatten along regional detachments and do not cut down to the brittle-ductile transition, requiring different definitions of maximum faulting depth for the two regimes. With parameters from points 1) to 3) we calculate 4) the seismogenic brittle volume and, by means of empirical relationship 5) the maximum potential magnitude based on the potential seismogenic volume. Eventually, 6) regions with maximum probability of future moderate\/large earthquakes occurrence are delimited, depending on the present strain rate. The map of the maximum possible magnitude in Italy based on the seismogenic brittle volume is finally proposed.\n\n3.1\nAreal extent of compression, tension and strike-slip deformation\nBoundaries of compressional regions (blue boxes in Fig. 1) are modified from Petricca et al. (2019) while extensional and strike-slip areas (red and green boxes in Fig. 1) are modified from Petricca et al. (2015). Homogeneous kinematic areas are defined by integrating the location of Apennines and Alps thrust fronts from literature (Carminati and Doglioni, 2012; Petricca et al., 2013), GPS data and the geometry of composite seismogenic sources from the database of the individual seismogenic sources of Italy (DISS - DISS Working Group, 2021). The closure of polygons is obtained by considering horizontal GPS velocity field along the transects published in Petricca et al. (2015), i.e., selecting the points separating extensional\/contractional fields along the whole study domain.\n\n\n3.2\nThe length - maximum fault depth ratio (C) and dip angles of Italian faults\nThe first assumption of our method is that fault ruptures show a well-defined shape ratio (C) between fault length (Lf) and maximum fault depth (zmax), that is dependent on fault-type (extensional, compressional or strike-slip). C values are here derived from individual seismogenic sources (ISS) given in the DISS database (DISS Working Group, 2021). From DISS we selected all the 43 ISSs with thrust\/transpressional kinematics (i.e., 45\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0rake angle <135\u00b0), the 59 ISSs with normal\/transtensional kinematics (i.e., 225\u00b0\u00a0<\u00a0rake angle <315\u00b0) and all the 21 ISSs with strike slip kinematics (i.e., 135\u00b0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0rake angle \u2264225\u00b0, rake angle\u00a0\u2265315\u00b0 and rake angle \u226445\u00b0). The given values for the minimum and maximum source depth (Min depth and Max depth in the DISS nomenclature) and the source rupture length (Lf) are used to calculate the ratio between fault length and the maximum depth of faulting Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a0Lf\/(Max depth - Min depth). Values for normal faults are distributed around Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133 (Fig. 2a), for thrust faults around Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20134 (Fig. 2b) while for strike-slip are Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20132 (Fig. 2c). Lf\/zmax ratio increases with the magnitude and the rupture length. We use obtained Lf\/zmax ranges (Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133 and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20134 for normal and thrust faults respectively) as end-members in the following computations of the maximum seismogenic volume. The value obtained for strike slip faults (Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01\u20132) is constrained by very few events and is at odds with detailed studies for strike-slip events in Italy (e.g., Fracassi and Valensise, 2007; Valensise et al., 2004). For the sake of completeness, based on the literature we extended the range for strike-slips faults up to Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03.\nFrom the same DISS database we extrapolated the maximum and minimum fault dip values for the three different regimes that are: 20\u00b0-85\u00b0 (normal), 20\u00b0-55\u00b0 (thrust) and 45\u00b0-88\u00b0 (strike-slip); the median values are 55\u00b0, 35\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 respectively (Fig. 2d-f). The maximum and minimum values are used as upper and lower bounds in brittle volume calculation while we consider the medians as the reference value in the resulting preferred map of maximum possible magnitudes. However, our calculations are extended to different fault dip values.\n\n\n3.3\nDecollement depth and Brittle-Ductile Transition Depth (BDT)\nThe maximum volume that can be activated during the seismic cycle is constrained by the depth of the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) or by the depth of the decollement of the basal active thrust (Petricca et al., 2015, 2019). Normal fault rupture tends to propagate upward cutting the brittle crust (Carminati et al., 2004). However, normal faults may flatten shallower than the brittle-ductile transition depth into low-angle faults cutting throughout low friction formations as it occurred in the 2016\u20132017 Mw6.5 Amatrice-Norcia central Italy seismic sequence (Carminati et al., 2020). Also thrust faults may not necessarily cut down to the brittle-ductile transition (Hyndman et al., 1997). It follows that, for different seismotectonic areas of Italy (Fig. 1), we utilize two different approaches that consider i) the map of the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth for extensional and strike-slip tectonics, and ii) the map of the active thrusts decollement depth for compressional tectonics (Fig. 3\n). The map of BDT depth is used to calculate brittle volumes in the extensional\/strike-slip domains and is produced following the procedure described in Petricca et al. (2015); is based on the same base parameters that are the heat flow (from Della Vedova et al., 2001), the crustal thickness (from Mele et al., 2013; Carafa and Barba, 2011), and the strain rate. The version of the map presented in this study is recomputed considering the last available solution for the strain rate (SR) obtained using updated GPS data (Devoti et al., 2017) with respect to the old solution used in Petricca et al. (2015). The thickness of the brittle layer of the upper crust is calculated on a 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 km grid based on the thermal profile calculated at each node. The map of the decollement depth is recomputed from Petricca et al. (2019), integrating data from compressional areas of Italy not considered in the previous version. The traces of the geological cross-sections utilized in this study are displayed in red in Fig. 3 and include datasets from Cassano et al. (1986), Merlini et al. (2002), Pezzo et al. (2020), Sch\u00f6nborn (1999), Scrocca (2006) and Doglioni and Carminati (2008).\nDue to the fact that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth is possibly and locally shallower than the basal thrust depth (Petricca et al., 2019), we compare the BDT depths with the basal thrust depths selecting at each node of the compressional areas the shallower value. The BDT is shallower than the basal thrust depth in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (off-shore Sicily).\n\n\n3.4\nThe seismogenic brittle volume\nThe maximum volume that can be mobilized by a fault during the coseismic stage is quantifiable a priori. It is possible to approximate it to a triangular-base prism since it describes the deformed epicentral area determined by the volume size and the related fault length, depth and dip (Petricca et al., 2021). The volume of the prism can be obtained by considering the length of a hypothetic master fault, that is proportional to C (length - fault depth ratio; see section 3.2), multiplied by the maximum faulting depth zmax (BDT or decollement depth) and by a conjugated fault dipping 90\u00b0 opposite to the master fault (see Petricca et al., 2015 and Petricca et al., 2019 for better explanation). Brittle volumes are calculated over a regular grid of 10\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0km for the whole Italian territory. This approach aims at constraining the upper limit of the seismic energy potentially available for a given region (i.e. the maximum possible brittle volume) irrespective of the detail of knowledge of the area (e.g., the presence of blind seismogenic faults or fault inactivity longer than historic record are overcome). The height of the prism is assumed to be equal to the BDT depth for normal and strike-slip faults and to the active decollement depth for thrust faults. The volume is calculated using the relationship (Petricca et al., 2019):\n\n\n\n\n1\n)\n\nV\n=\n\nC\n2\n\n\n\nz\n3\n\n\nm\na\nx\n\n\n\n\ncot\n\n\u03b1\n\n+\ncot\n\n\n90\n\u2212\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the fault dip (20\u00b0 to 55\u00b0 for thrust, 20\u00b0 to 85\u00b0 for normal and 45\u00b0 to 88\u00b0 for strike-slip faults), zmax is the deepest tip of the activation of a seismogenic thrust or the BDT depth along a seismogenic normal or strike-slip fault, C is the Lf\/zmax ratio (1 to 4 for thrust, 1 to 3 for normal and strike-slip faults). Brittle volumes up to about 1.7\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in compressional areas assuming a fault dip of 35\u00b0 (i.e. the median value characterizing active thrusts in Italy) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a04. Brittle volumes up to 7.8\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in extensional areas assuming a fault dip of 55\u00b0 (i.e., the median value) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a03. Brittle volumes up to 6.4\u2219104\u00a0km3 are obtained in strike-slip areas assuming a fault dip of 80\u00b0 (i.e., the median value) and considering C\u00a0=\u00a01 (Fig. 4\n). The full range of variation of maximum brittle volumes obtained by changing initial parameters (fault dip angles \u03b1 and shape ratio C) are summarized in Table 1\n and collected in Table S3.\n\n\n3.5\nMaximum potential magnitude and tectonic regime\nIn extensional settings, gravity favors faulting because, according to Anderson's model (Anderson, 1951), the maximum stress axis is approximately parallel to the lithostatic load. The lithostatic load rather buffers (i.e., counteracts) the elastic energy accumulated during the interseismic period in thrust or strike-slip faulting. The elastic rebound is commonly considered as the main model for earthquake generation, being inferred as the mechanism dissipating the elastic energy accumulated during the interseismic period. This is likely true for contractional and strike-slip tectonic settings, but in extensional environments, the influence of gravity may rather be dominant (Doglioni et al., 2011; Bignami et al., 2020). The occurrence of different mechanisms controlling earthquakes in different tectonic settings must be considered when calculating magnitudes expected from a potential brittle volume. A linear correlation was proposed between earthquake magnitudes and the logarithm of the seismogenic volume (Bath and Duda, 1964; Petricca et al., 2015, 2019). The maximum potential magnitude (M) can be calculated as (Bath and Duda, 1964):\n\n\n2\n)\n\n\nM\nBD\n\n=\n\n\nl\no\ng\n\n\nV\n\n\u2212\n9\n.\n58\n\n\n1\n.\n47\n\n\n\n\nwhere V is the brittle volume in cm3. MBD is appropriate for thrust and strike-slip areas, but it does not consider the role of the gravitational potential, that is dominant in extensional tectonic, for which we can introduce the potential residual energy RU:\n\n\n3\n)\n\nRU\n=\n\u03c1Vg\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n\ncos\u03b1\n\n\n\nu\ns\n\n\n\nwhere \u03c1V is the mass of a volume V (km3) having density \u03c1 (we adopt average value for continental crust 2600\u00a0kg\/m3; Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981); \u03bc is the fault friction coefficient (0.6 according to Byerlee, 1978), us the average coseismic slip (in m) and \u03b1 the assumed fault dip. For extensional areas, the maximum possible magnitude is calculated as (Choy and Boatwright, 1995):\n\n\n4\n)\n\n\nM\nCH\n\n=\n\n2\n3\n\nlog\n\n\nRU\n\u00d7\n\nr\nc\n\n\n\n\u2013\n3.2\n\n\nwhere rc is the seismic radiation coefficient (Aki and Richards, 1980) here assumed equal to 1.0 (Choy and Boatwright, 1995; Doglioni et al., 2011). Since the gravity force must be considered in extensional tectonics we calculate MCH for extensional areas. MBD is more appropriate to be computed in thrust and strike-slip areas.\n\nPetricca et al. (2018) showed that for thrust tectonics (i.e., where elastic force dominates) a given brittle volume has a potential magnitude that increases by 1 when the shortening rate is 10 times faster. Italy (excluding volcanic areas) is characterized by strain rates in the range of 1 to 5\u00a0mm\/yr (Devoti et al., 2017). We used velocities interpolated from Devoti et al. (2017) (Fig. 5\n) to correct the maximum magnitudes predicted in compressional and strike-slip areas. The velocity has been normalized in the 0\u20131 range and added to the magnitude obtained by volumetric constraints. Eventually, we get that the maximum magnitude predicted by our model depends on the brittle volume plus the gravitational potential in extensional areas and on the brittle volume plus the strain rate in compressional and strike-slip areas. The difference in methodology is consistent with the fact that, in the brittle volume - predicted magnitude diagram of Fig. 6\n, the magnitudes calculated at each node with our preferred model are aligned along a curve for extensional tectonic settings (red curve), while for compressional and strike-slip tectonic settings, for which the same brittle volume can predict different magnitudes depending on the strain rate, the calculated magnitudes occur in bands (blue for compression; green for strike-slip).\n\n\n\n4\nThe maximum potential magnitude of Italy\nThe map of magnitudes calculated from maximum brittle volumes is presented in Fig. 7\n for well constrained areas of Italy (compressional, extensional and strike-slip areas; Table S3) assuming the following values for geometric parameters: a fault dip of 35\u00b0 (thrust), 55\u00b0 (normal) and 80\u00b0 (strike-slip), Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a04 (thrust), Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 (normal) and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 (strike-slip). According to the model presented here, the maximum potential magnitude in regions under tension ranges between 4.5 and 7.6. Magnitudes between 4.3 and 7.1 are obtained considering Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 while magnitude range increases to 4.1\u20138.7 considering Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 and increasing the fault dip to 85\u00b0 (Fig. 8a and Table 1). The maximum magnitude is predicted along the Apennines axis, i.e. where the brittle layer is thicker (Fig. 3) and the most recent energetic normal earthquakes of Italy are concentrated (e.g. Colfiorito 1998 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0; Norcia Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5 and Amatrice Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.02016; L'Aquila 2009 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.3; Irpinia 1980 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.9). Even larger earthquakes characterize the Southern Apennines area, with historical events that reached magnitudes up to 7.3 (see section 2 for references).\nIn thrust-fault settings, a 3.8\u20137.8 potential magnitude range is obtained (Fig. 7); maximum potential magnitude range decreases to 3.8\u20137.4 assuming minimum Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a01 and maximum fault dip of 55\u00b0. A 3.9\u20138.0 Mw range is obtained assuming Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a04 and fault dip of 20\u00b0 (Table1). The maximum magnitudes are predicted where the decollement depth (zmax) is deeper (Fig. 3): the front of the Apennines accretionary prism in the Po Plain (where the Emilia sequence took place in 2012 with Mw 6.1 and Mw 6 earthquakes); the Eastern Alps where the Mw 6.4 Friuli 1976 earthquake occurred. Magnitudes decrease moving toward the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea (i.e., at the external thrust front). The southeast offshore Calabrian accretionary prism (notice that catalogs report only small earthquakes for this region) suffers from the absence of GPS data on the Ionian Sea used to interpolate the velocity field considered for magnitude calculation (great error due to unconstrained interpolation). This results in a very noisy map in those areas and where the larger magnitudes are predicted for thrust settings. Moderate seismicity (4\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a05.5) is recorded in the South Tyrrhenian Sea. The calculated maximum potential magnitude is consistent with the strongest thrust-fault earthquake known from historical catalogs (Mw 6.5 occurred in 1117 along the Southern Alps front; Guidoboni et al., 2005).\nMaximum magnitudes in strike-slip areas are expected to vary between 5.6 and 7.6 (Fig. 8a). Considering a minimum fault dip angle of 45\u00b0, consistent with observations, the range decreases to 5.3\u20137.3 while it increases to 6.0\u20138.0 in case of faults dipping 85\u00b0 and Lf\/zmax\u00a0=\u00a03 (Table 1). A magnitude value of 6.7 is reported for the most energetic strike-slip earthquake in Italy (the 1627 Gargano earthquake Mw 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10; Rovida et al., 2021). Further, M\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 has been experienced several times in southern Apennines and Sicily (Daunia 1361 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.0; Gargano 1646 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.7; Tavoliere delle Puglie 1731 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.3; Melfi 1851 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.5; Gondola 1893 Mw\u00a0=\u00a05.4; Patti gulf 1978 Mw\u00a0=\u00a06.1 - Rovida et al., 2021).\n\n\n5\nDiscussions\nThe model presented here is based on the potential brittle volume concept and is time independent, i.e., magnitudes are calculated using physical parameters, regardless of the seismic catalogs. Our model provides a basis for seismic hazard assessment, alternative to those so far used as input required for the following techniques (e.g., PSHA, DSHA, NDSHA). The leading concept is that the brittle volume, during the interseismic period, is an accumulator of seismic energy, which is entirely dissipated at the coseismic stage. This energy is mainly elastic for thrusts and strike-slip faults, whereas it is gravitational for normal faults (Doglioni et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2015, 2019, 2021). After calculating the volume potentially involved in faulting, it is possible to derive (by means of empirical relationships) the associated earthquake magnitudes (Bath and Duda, 1964; Petricca et al., 2015; Petricca et al., 2019).\nOur results show that maximum possible magnitude increases with the assumed shape ratio factor (C) and with increasing fault dip angle in extensional and strike-slip settings, whereas it increases for decreasing fault dip angles in compressional settings (Table 1 and Table S3) as shown in Petricca et al. (2021). Predicted magnitudes vary in the range of \u00b10.77, \u00b1 0.37 and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for normal, strike-slip and thrust fault earthquakes respectively. Magnitudes calculated at each node of our model grow exponentially with respect to brittle volume for normal faulting (red curve in Fig. 6). In the case of thrust and strike-slip faulting the magnitude calculated for a same brittle volume depends on the strain rate (i.e. the faster the deformation the larger the magnitude), and the exponential growth of the curves depicts bands instead of a simple curve (blue and green bands for compression and strike-slip respectively in Fig. 6); the wider the band the larger the range of variation in the strain rate and, consequently, the predicted magnitude. Lower values for the maximum possible magnitude are obtained in the thrust fault setting (Fig. 8a) since the decollement depth is on average shallower (\u22481\u201317\u00a0km) than the BDT depth (\u22484\u201323\u00a0km). Furthermore, the smaller magnitude observed in compressional areas are also due to lower strain rates than in extensional settings (Petricca et al., 2018). The predicted magnitudes are sensitive to the choice of initial parameters (fault dip [\u03b1] and geometry [Lf\/zmax]) and to the tectonic regime. In fact, our map is intended as a fitting model with respect to a spectrum of variation of possible magnitude values. The total range of variation of predictions (Fig. 8a) is wider for normal faulting (up to 1.5 points for large magnitudes) than for strike-slip and thrust faulting (less than 0.8 points). The prediction of our preferred model (black line in Fig. 8a) is centered on the error band (green) related to strike-slip areas, whereas it is shifted to the lower part of the error band (red) for extensional areas, and to the upper part for compressional areas (blue band). Consequently, the maximum positive errors occur for normal faults (Fig. 8b) and the maximum negative errors for thrust faults (Fig. 8c).\nBased on our best model, we perform a quantitative comparison among maximum magnitudes predicted by the present study with those 1) from seismic catalogs (CPTI15v3.0 - Rovida et al., 2021; CFTI5Med - Guidoboni et al., 2019), 2) from fault length-magnitude empirical relationships (Trippetta et al., 2019) and 3) from integrated studies (DISS 3.3.0 \u2013 DISS Working Group, 2021).\n\n1)\nModel results are tested against the Italian seismicity with Mw\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0 and depth\u00a0\u2264\u00a030\u00a0km collected in the CPTI15v3.0 (Rovida et al., 2021) covering the 1005\u20132019 time interval and the CFTI5Med (Guidoboni et al., 2019) covering the 0\u20131997 time interval (Fig. 9a). The difference (\u0394Mw) between magnitudes predicted by our model and observed magnitudes for the whole study domain are plotted in Fig. 9 against magnitude and year of occurrence of each event. The majority of historical\/instrumental earthquakes are in agreement with predictions of our model (Fig. 9b-c). In some cases, the model, intended to predict maximum magnitude for a given location, overestimates magnitude of observed events. The model underestimates by 0.1\u20130.2 the magnitude of a few events along the Apennines chain and in the Tyrrhenian Sea, plus two events in Sicily. The magnitude of a thrust event occurred in 1117 (Veronese earthquake Mw 6.5 in Po Plain \u2013 Guidoboni et al., 2005) is underestimated by \u22480.28.\n\n\n2)\n\nTrippetta et al. (2019), assuming that any fault can in principle be reactivated, compared the maximum magnitudes obtained by an extensive compilation of faults in Italy assessed by means of empirical relationships (Fault Length Earthquake Magnitude - FLEM) with magnitudes from national seismic catalogs. Their results show in most cases a good agreement between predicted and observed magnitudes, with differences that are in the \u00b11.0 range (in well-constrained areas) but almost always underestimating the observed value for Mw\u00a0\u22656.5 (see their Fig. 13). By comparing magnitudes predicted by our study with FLEMs in Trippetta et al. (2019), it follows that magnitude estimates are larger for our model when Mw\u00a0>\u00a07.0, while larger FLEMs are given when Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.0. A good agreement between the two models is observed for 6.0\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a07.0, where the regression lines intercept the reference line (Fig. 10\n). The reason for underestimation of low magnitudes is that magnitudes obtained from fault lengths suffer the impossibility to resolve fault continuity and segmentation (i.e., the faults used for magnitude by Trippetta et al., 2019, could be segmented). In addition, the underestimation can be due to the lack of knowledge where detailed geologic studies (i.e. better estimates of fault dimensions) are not available.\n\n\n3)\nComparing our results with maximum magnitudes assigned to individual seismogenic sources (ISSs) of the DISS (DISS Working Group, 2021 \u2013 Table S4) the following strengths and weaknesses of our method emerge (Fig. 11a-b). Pros: i) as conservative as they were intended to be, our predicted magnitudes are larger than those of earthquakes that occurred both in historical and instrumental epochs. This is especially true for normal and strike-slip earthquakes whose magnitude mainly depends on the BDT depth, well-defined for the Italian territory; ii) the overestimation with respect of magnitudes defined for historic and instrumental events decreases moving from high (max overestimation \u2248 +1.5) to low (max overestimation \u2248 +0.5) magnitude earthquakes (see colored lines in Fig. 11a-b). In few cases, the magnitudes reported in the DISS ISSs are larger than those predicted by our model. However, these earthquakes are associated with sources that produced their last earthquake before the XIX century. Overall, our model overestimates magnitudes and, consequently, should account also for uncharacteristic earthquakes (e.g. Geller et al., 2015 and references therein); iii) in Italy larger magnitudes are predicted for normal, intermediate for strike-slip and lower for thrust faults earthquakes, fitting DISS predictions. Cons: an underestimation of large magnitudes (M\u00a0>\u00a06.0) emerges for thrust fault earthquakes. Worth of notice is that thrust earthquakes larger than 6.5 are still not recorded instrumentally, so far. It cannot be excluded that such inconsistency may result from the overestimation of magnitudes in historic catalogs based on macroseismic estimation. Our underestimation could also be related to large error (\u2212 a few km) in the definition of the maximum thrust decollement depth (see Petricca et al., 2019). Notice that each individual seismogenic source (ISS) of the DISS is associated with a composite seismogenic source (CSS) that may include one or more individual sources characterized by homogeneous parametrization (see Basili et al., 2008 for details). In the last release of the DISS (v3.3.0) a new magnitude for CSSs is calculated based on scaling relation from Leonard (2014), a step in the direction of an increase in the maximum magnitude values. In Fig. 11c and d, we provide another comparison between magnitudes predicted by our preferred model and the magnitude assigned to composite seismogenic sources (CSS), highlighting how the differences between the two models are in the range of \u00b10.5.\n\n\n\nThe Italian Seismic Hazard Model MPS19 (Meletti et al., 2021; Visini et al., 2021) estimates the maximum magnitude for 18 tectonically homogeneous macro-areas by selecting the maximum value reported in the CPTI15 catalog (Rovida et al., 2021) and the value reported in the ISS of the DISS database (DISS Working Group, 2021), assigning to each area the largest value between the two magnitudes. This raises the point of what level of hazard must be considered, that is a questionable and subjective decision especially in PSHA, since improper selection of parameters may lead to either unsafe or overly conservative designs. As it emerges from this discussion, the maximum magnitude is a prime parameter that, in our opinion, should be as conservative as possible as our method has demonstrated to be. Our model tendency to overestimation of magnitudes may occur because of involved brittle volumes smaller than expected. This may be due to faults detached at levels shallower than the brittle ductile transition, or to fault aseismic behavior. Further, the calculation for extensional tectonic regimes depends on the radiation coefficient that we kept equal to 1.0 but could be much smaller (down to 0.03; Choy and Boatwright, 1995), thus reducing the magnitude value by \u22481. However, strong or major earthquakes should not be excluded as in case they could have longer recurrence time (not recorded yet).\nIn seismic areas earthquakes recurrence depends on the velocity at which deformation, currently, takes place. Low magnitude earthquakes occur at all observed strain rates, while larger magnitudes occur at low strain rates only. In fact, Riguzzi et al. (2012) observed for Italy that past earthquakes with magnitudes >5.0 occurred where geodetic strain rate (SR) is <20 nanostrain\/yr, while M is limited to 5.0 where SR\u00a0>\u00a020 nanostrain\/yr. Further, SR =40 nanostrain\/yr is, for Italy, the bound value separating areas characterized by significant seismic activity from those affected by background seismicity (Riguzzi et al., 2012). However, small strain rates imply that the recurrence interval of large events would be very large.\nAccording to Riguzzi et al. (2012) future earthquakes are more likely to occur sooner in regions with low SR (i.e., regions having the same tectonic regime and geodetic velocity, but relatively lower strain; gray areas in Fig. 12\n), having longer recurrence time for contractional settings (Riguzzi et al., 2012). High strain rates (>20 nanostrain\/yr) lead to lower probability to generate strong earthquakes soon and are observed in regions struck by important seismic sequences in the last century (i.e., Friuli 1976 in the Eastern Alps; Emilia 2012 in the Po Plain; Fucino 1915, Irpinia 1980, Colfiorito 1997, L'aquila 2009 and central Italy in 2016 along the Apennine extensional belt, 1905\u20131908 in Calabria and Sicily; see Fig. 1 and red areas in Fig. 12). This information can be integrated with our Mmax predictions. In terms of hazard, we expect large earthquakes to occur in low strain rate areas only if there is a potential of Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 in our map. Large magnitudes are expected due to low strain rate in the compressional part of northern Italy (5\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.5). Earthquakes of magnitude 5\u00a0<\u00a0Mw\u00a0<\u00a06.5\u20137.0 are expected in central Calabria (extension) and Ionian off-shore (compression) where the higher strain is recorded in the accretionary prism of the Calabria subduction. Magnitudes between 5.8 and 6.0 are likely to occur in contractional regions in the Adriatic Sea. Notice that slow strain rates are associated with shallower depth of the decollement layer for thrusts (Petricca et al., 2018), hence limiting the maximum value for earthquake magnitudes. Further, a thin crust prevents the occurrence of crustal earthquakes with Mw\u00a0>\u00a05 in the extensional setting of the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nIt should finally be noted that there are few regions along the central-northern Apennines extensional chain where Mw7 are predicted by our model, and that have not yet experienced strong earthquakes in the recent period (compare gray areas in Fig. 12 with the same points in Fig. 7). These areas are located north of the 1997, 2009 and 2016 seismic sequences of Central Italy (events 8, 9, 11 and 12 in Fig. 1). Notice that the definition of the strain rate strictly depends on the GPS network density, accuracy, time-span and it is not homogeneous within the territory. This makes our indication just preliminary with no intentions to provide a time for the occurrence of the next earthquake.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nA theoretical model aimed at providing values for the maximum possible magnitude is proposed and applied to the Italian area. The maximum possible magnitude is calculated on available brittle volumes obtained considering active thrusts decollement depths (in compressional areas) or brittle-ductile transition depths (in extensional and strike-slip areas). Maximum magnitudes depend on elastic energy and therefore on strain rates for thrusts and strike-slip faults, and on gravitational energy for normal faults. The magnitudes are proportional to the ratio between fault lengths and the maximum depth of faulting. The Maximum magnitudes are calculated utilizing empirical relationships and presented in a single map. The largest predicted values are 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 for thrust faulting, 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 for normal faulting and 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 for strike-slip faulting. These values are higher with respect to the largest magnitude of thrust (Mw 6.5\u20136.7), normal (7.3) and strike-slip (Mw 6.7) related earthquakes recorded in Italy. This could be interpreted as related to two possibilities, i.e., 1) an overestimation of the computed volume due, for example, to decollement layers shallower than the BDT, or 2) a longer recurrence time of strong and major earthquakes that have not yet occurred in the Italian historical record. The occurrence of earthquakes with a given magnitude may be related to current strain rates. The combination of our map of maximum possible magnitude with the map of current strain rates by Devoti et al. (2017) shows that a large part of the Italian territory is prone to earthquakes with M\u00a0>\u00a05 in the near future.\n\n\nCredit statement\nPatrizio Petricca: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Data curation, Writing- Original draft preparation, Visualization, Formal analysis, Supervision.

Analysis of interplay between crustal fabrics and faulting is best performed in dense 2D and 3D seismic reflection datasets, especially in modern high-quality, long-offset data with extended record length that allow imaging of the middle-lower crust below shallow fault networks. Thereby, fundamental links between preserved sedimentary basins bound by faults, basement fabrics, and events of subsidence and uplift can be established (e.g. Collanega et al., 2019; Kirkpatrick et al., 2013; Prosser, 1993; Ravn\u00e5s et al., 2000; Strugale et al., 2021). Basement fabrics are mainly structural heterogeneities inherited from orogenic events (e.g. Bird et al., 2015; Wernicke and Snow, 1998), post-orogenic extensional collapse tectonics (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Jolivet et al., 1998; Osmundsen et al., 2021), previous rift phases (e.g. Duffy et al., 2015; Manatschal et al., 2015; Serck and Braathen, 2019; Tvedt et al., 2013) and\/or tectonic inversion events (e.g. Collanega et al., 2019). The North Sea offers a unique laboratory, as the bounding mainland offers detailed insight into the collapse of the Caledonides that can be projected offshore (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Many of these basins have been explored for hydrocarbons since the 1960's, resulting in hydrocarbon discoveries and acquisition of a large catalogue of seismic and well data (Faleide et al., 2015). Limited record length for seismic data below target horizons for exploration wells, however, have left a knowledge gap of the geological evolution of the North Sea area before the well-constrained Permo-Triassic rift episode. With improved seismic data coverage and quality, along with recent hydrocarbon discoveries in fractured and weathered basement, there is renewed interest in both the crystalline basement and the pre-rift evolution of the area (Fig. 1\n) (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016; Riber et al., 2015). Drilled basement highs around the North Sea rift system has yielded useful information about the configuration of the underlying basement rocks, which varies in terms of lithology, structures and pre-Caledonian affinity (Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015, 2019; Slagstad et al., 2011). Importantly, basement penetrated in the Utsira High are Ordovician-Silurian allochthonous crystalline rocks, predominantly granitoids (Lundmark et al., 2014; Slagstad et al., 2011).\nSeveral regional studies of the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the North Sea have emphasized offshore continuations of major structures mapped onshore (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Fossen and Hurich, 2005; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Robust interpretations have been facilitated by increasingly higher quality seismic data, which has allowed for seismic facies analysis of deeply buried basement rock units across wide areas. These areas include the Utsira High, which occupies a position on the flank of several large rift basins that developed during several extensional episodes (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019). Relationships between rift faults rooted in basement and underlying extensional shear zones from collapse of the Caledonian Orogeny have been established (Phillips et al., 2016, 2019). However, no attempts have been made to discuss the magnitude of vertical movements seen in the light of post-Caledonian large-scale detachment faulting, qualify the timing of uplift events, or consider whether detachment-related vertical movements affected basins and faults. In this article, we aim at addressing these topics by re-appraising the structural development of the Utsira High and adjacent areas, taking into account recent advances in our understanding of detachment faulting and metamorphic core complex evolution. We link large-magnitude faulting from the Devonian onwards to km-scale vertical movements of the Utsira High with excision of crystalline basement and parts of the sedimentary succession. In this context, we consider the Utsira High a metamorphic core complex, as previously suggested by Phillips et al. (2019).\n\n\n2\nGeological framework\nNumerous tectonic provinces show transitions from collision to subsequent extensional tectonics, commonly recorded as fast exhumation of middle-lower crust in metamorphic core complexes (Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Brun et al., 2018; Fossen et al., 2017). Outstanding examples are found in onshore-offshore links of central Norway, from where an evolution of polyphase faulting that ultimately lead to continental breakup have been described (Osmundsen et al., 2021; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020). Further south, extension appears less comprehensive, ascribed to aborted rift events (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen et al., 2017; Wiest et al., 2020).\nThe North Sea basin consists of a series of large rift grabens\/half-grabens bounded by prominent basement highs. The variable-thickness sedimentary fill overlies crystalline crust that was assembled during the Sveconorwegian orogeny and reorganized during the Caledonian orogeny (Roffeis and Corfu, 2014; Slagstad et al., 2013). The crust constitutes a patchwork of igneous, metamorphic and metasedimentary rock units in a nappe stack (F\u00e6rseth et al., 1995; Gee et al., 2008; Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015; Slagstad et al., 2011; Ziegler, 1975, 1982). The nappe stack was dissected by extensional faults and shear zones related to the Devonian collapse of the Caledonian orogeny (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Braathen et al., 2000, 2018; Fossen, 2010; Norton, 1986; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001). Detachment faulting generated an array of supradetachment basins along the Norwegian North Sea margin (Osmundsen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Vetti and Fossen, 2012). Although challenging to delineate in seismic data, and infrequently penetrated by exploration wells, recent onshore-offshore correlations suggest the system of Devonian extensional shear zones and basins extends into the North Sea Basin, forming the structural template on which the North Sea rift subsequently developed (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020). Extensional faulting events, most notably in the Permo-Triassic and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, led to deposition of wedge-shaped sedimentary growth packages in large half-graben basins (Badley et al., 1988; Duffy et al., 2015; Fazlikhani et al., 2021; Mulrooney et al., 2020; Odinsen et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2019; Ziegler, 1992). We address the polyphase rift evolution by a detailed analysis of the Utsira High and adjacent areas. Following the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rift event, deformation migrated west of the UK to the Atlantic rift, leaving the North Sea as a failed rift (Erratt et al., 1999; Glennie, 1995; Ziegler, 1992). In the North Sea Basin, thermal subsidence persisted through the late Mesozoic into the Paleocene with deposition of a sedimentary package several kilometers thick (e.g. Baig et al., 2019; Gabrielsen et al., 2001).\nThe Utsira High is a structural culmination located in the Norwegian North Sea between the Viking Graben to the west, Stord Basin to the east and Ling Depression to the south (Fig. 1). It is cored by basement rocks, and major faults delineate its eastern and western margins (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015). The south flank constitutes a south-dipping slope of the top basement surface towards the Ling Depression. A similar dipslope into the Viking Graben exists on the west side. The Utsira High was subaerially exposed for extended periods of time, as indicated by missing strata and weathering profiles capping the crystalline basement (Riber et al., 2015, 2019). Improved deep seismic imaging in the North Sea basin has allowed for seismic facies analysis of basement rocks, shedding light on pre-rift extensional shear zones that are exploited or cross-cut by younger rift faults (e.g. Bird et al., 2015; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016; Wiest et al., 2020). The Utsira High has been indicated to represent a metamorphic core complex that developed in the footwall of the Utsira Shear Zone based on the mapped shape of reflector packages in basement rocks (Phillips et al., 2019).\n\n\n3\nData and methods\n\n3.1\nData\nThe area has been investigated through interpretation of approximately 20,000\u00a0km of TGS\u2019 CFI-NSR long-offset 2D seismic reflection data. 2D line spacing is mostly 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 km with certain areas more sparsely (10x10km) or densely (1.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.25\u00a0km) covered. Roughly 3600\u00a0km2 of publicly available 3D data downloaded from the Diskos database allowed for more detailed interpretation of certain areas of the Utsira High (Fig. 1). Table 1\n summarizes relevant parameters of acquisition and resolution of the seismic data. Publicly available well data have been utilized for constraining ages of seismic reflector packages.\n\n\n\n4\nMethods\nConventional seismic interpretation was carried out using the DUG Insight 4 and Schlumberger Petrel 2020 seismic interpretation softwares. A geomodel was generated from 2D and 3D line interpretations, facilitating calculations of time structure maps and time thickness maps. Scientific color maps of Crameri (2021) are used for displaying seismic lines and maps. Seismic interpretation of 11 surfaces ranging in age from Quaternary to Devonian(?), in addition to a number of faults, forms the framework of this study. Seismic facies analysis allows for separation of basement rock units. Seismic facies units and seismic facies relationships have been mapped following a similar workflow to those outlined in recent papers by e.g. Fazlikhani et al. (2017), Gresseth et al. (2021), Lenhart et al. (2019), Phillips et al. (2016, 2019), Strugale et al. (2021) and Wiest et al. (2020), where contrasting facies units and truncating relationships locate tectonic boundaries.\n2D structural restoration of a seismic section with faults and horizons have been performed using MOVE 2020 software from Petex. Prior to restoration, the seismic line was depth converted based on a velocity model that was built with migration velocities from TGS's processing. The velocity model was adjusted to reflect our regional understanding of the basement rock distribution, together with a high-confidence Top basement interpretation. A constant velocity of 6200\u00a0m\/s was selected for the crystalline basement. Structural restoration consisted of a combination of successive modeling steps including decompaction, unfolding by simple shear and flexural slip, and move-on-fault algorithms. Eroded strata were reconstructed based on net erosion estimates for the area by Baig et al. (2019). Further details on the structural restoration can be found in Appendix 1.\n\n\n5\nSeismic facies\nThe seismic data used for this study vary in terms of acquisition year, acquisition parameters and seismic processing, resulting in variations of the seismic image. Deep imaging of basement rocks is not the main focus of commercial seismic data acquisition in the North Sea; therefore, the seismic imaging of basement rocks is variable, not only from one dataset to the next but occasionally also between adjacent lines within the same dataset. Nevertheless, certain characteristics of the seismic signal, such as reflection amplitude, frequency, continuity and geometry of reflection sets are readily mappable on a semi-regional scale. This mapping has allowed for subdivision of basement rocks into discrete seismic facies (SF) (Fig. 2\n). We follow a similar workflow to previous publications focused on basement reflectivity in the Norwegian North Sea, some also considering onshore-offshore relationships (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Lenhart et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Wiest et al., 2020).\n\n5.1\nSeismic facies 1 (SF1)\nSF1 is characterized by low reflectivity and discontinuous reflections. The upper basement unit consists predominantly of SF1, forming the depositional substrate for cover sediments (Figs. 1d, 2). In the upper basement unit, the chaotic SF1 reflection pattern is cross-cut by both steep and gently dipping reflections. The steep reflections are persistent through much of the unit and are often seen in relation to steep faults that either offset or terminate at the top-basement surface. Some steep reflections sole out in the boundary with a lower basement unit (SF2) (Figs. 3a, 4a\n). The upper basement unit varies greatly in TWT thickness. The thinner parts of the unit (~1000\u00a0ms TWT) are mostly centered under the high, thickening towards the east, west and south into the Stord Basin (~4500\u00a0ms TWT), Viking Graben and Ling Depression, respectively (Fig. 5e). Where the upper basement unit is thin, the SF1 fabric is seen to mimic the shape of the boundary surface to the SF2 basement unit below. At the southern Utsira flank, the SF1 fabric within the upper basement unit is cross-cut by a set of strong amplitude, subhorizontal reflections. Steep faults that bound sedimentary basins sole out on these reflections (Fig. 6\n). SF1 reflections are commonly truncated by faults (e.g. Fig. 1d). Locally within the East Shetland Platform, faint stratification of the uppermost basement is observed to be truncated at the Top basement surface (Fig. 3a).\nThe low reflectivity suggests the SF1 represents a rather homogeneous rock mass. Most wells that penetrate into basement in the study area report granitic basement rocks dated to c. 430\u00a0Ma (Lundmark et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015, 2019; Slagstad et al., 2011). We therefore interpret the bulk of the upper basement unit, which consists entirely of SF1, as an allochthonous body of granite, which was emplaced as part of the nappe stack during the Caledonian orogeny and later cross-cut by steep, brittle faults whose persistence is typical for such a homogeneous lithology. SF3 of Fazlikhani et al. (2017), interpreted as \u201cProterozoic basement\u201d, is reminiscent of our SF1 in terms of its described discontinuous, chaotic reflection pattern. Their SF3, however, has not been constrained at depth to a similar extent as our SF1. Faintly stratified SF1 units in the East Shetland Platform are interpreted as Devonian sediments, consistent with Patruno et al. (2019) and Platt and Cartwright (1999). The weak reflections from the Devonian section may result from homogeneous sedimentary deposits, significant compaction from burial that increase seismic homogeneity, and masking from high-amplitude sedimentary units above (e.g. chalk deposits). The strongly variable thickness of the upper basement unit reflects different uplift and erosion across the study area with a relatively larger crustal uplift of the Utsira High compared to adjacent areas (Fig. 5e). Differences in thickness could be used as a measure of differential erosion and, hence, shed light on crustal uplift patterns.\n\n\n5.2\nSeismic facies 2 (SF2)\nSF2 has a medium- to high reflective seismic signature with a reflector continuity that varies from moderately continuous to fully continuous over distances of 10's of km's. The reflections are organized in bundles of shingled to undulating reflections that form local and semi-regional culminations. SF2 is the sole constituent of the lower basement unit, consistently observed under the SF1 upper basement unit. The lower basement unit extends down to the base of the seismic sections at 9\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 2). The Top-reflective-basement-surface (TRB) forms the boundary between SF1 and SF2 under the Utsira High and Viking Graben, but becomes less distinctive under the East Shetland Platform, and projects below data coverage (> 9\u00a0s TWT) under the Stord Basin. Sigmoidal reflector packages that converge with parallel upper and lower boundaries are occasionally identifiable on the west flank of the Utsira High (Fig. 7c) and on the East Shetland Platform at the Viking Graben margin (Figs. 4c, 3b). On the east flank of the Utsira High, however, these asymmetric structures dominate and are bounded by an east-dipping narrow rock body categorized as SF3 (Fig. 3c, 7b)). Towards the center of the Utsira High, SF2 reflections are more symmetrical and anastomosing than on the flanks (Fig. 3a)). Close to SF1 units, the SF2 fabric mimics the morphology of the TRB (Figs. 3, 4, 7d).\nSF2 differs greatly from SF1 in that its reflections are higher amplitude and more continuous throughout the dataset. The multi-scale encased sigmoidal reflector patterns resemble S\u2013C structures typical for simple-shear ductile deformation (Berth\u00e9 et al., 1979; Lister and Snoke, 1984), with several recent publications discussing large-scale S\u2013C structures in seismic data (Clerc et al., 2015; Lenhart et al., 2019; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020; Torvela et al., 2013). The SF2 seismic facies varies in configuration across the Utsira High. Anastomosing\/undulating reflections are most common in the central part of the high, while at the flanks the reflection pattern is more reminiscent of S\u2013C structures. These structures are mapped on different scales, up to several seconds TWT thick and consistently mappable over lengths of 10's of km's (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the structures seem to be best developed on the east flank, where they indicate top-E tectonic transport (Fig. 7b). Here, the uppermost S\u2013C structures are capped by a SF3 rock mass, the Utsira Shear Zone, which is seen as the downdip component of major normal faults displacing the TRB (Fig. 3). The less pronounced S\u2013C structures on the west flank of the Utsira High indicate top-W transport (Fig. 7c). The large-scale ductile deformation observed within SF2 units overlaps with descriptions by Lenhart et al. (2019) of their SF4. Their study focused on the M\u00e5l\u00f8y Slope, approximately 300\u00a0km northwest of our study area, in proximal position with respect to extensional systems mapped onshore Western Norway (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990). Hence, their study is not directly comparable to ours in terms of rock units, although the style of deformation has similarities. We consider SF2 to represent Caledonian nappes that have deformed in an overall ductile manner during overprinting extensional episodes that succeeded the Caledonian orogeny.\n\n\n5.3\nSeismic facies 3 (SF3)\nSF3 units are observed as relatively narrow bands of strong amplitude, continuous, parallel reflections. This seismic facies either trace the boundary between SF1 and SF2 or is entirely contained within one seismic facies. SF3 units displace or are oriented parallel to the TRB (Fig. 4). The strong reflections of SF3 are often seen as downdip extensions of basin-bounding faults (Fig. 2), thus constituting deep boundaries of major structural elements and juxtaposing SF1 in the footwall with SF2 in the hanging wall. In many locations, individual SF3 units converge with the TRB (Figs. 3, 4).\nSF3 differs from the other seismic facies in terms of its reflection characteristics with strong seismic amplitudes as well as limited thickness and spatial relations to the other seismic facies units. The pronounced reflection parallelism and narrow bands of reflections that relate to prominent brittle faults as well as the boundary between SF1 and SF2, suggest SF3 represent shear zone rock fabrics. This agrees with observations in previous publications from the North Sea (Fazlikhani et al., 2017 - their SF2; Lenhart et al., 2019 - their SF3; see also Phillips et al., 2016, 2019) and elsewhere (e.g. Gresseth et al., 2021 - their SF3; Strugale et al., 2021).\n\n\n5.4\nTop reflective basement (TRB)\nThe TRB represents the boundary between upper and lower domains within crystalline basement (Fig. 2). Commonly, this surface marks the boundary between SF1 and SF2; the boundary between low-reflective and high-reflective basement rocks. In the Utsira High, it is shaped as a broad, N-S elongated dome that is shallower under the Utsira High and deeper in the adjacent Ling Depression, Stord Basin and Viking Graben (Fig. 5d). SF1 and SF2 reflections close to the TRB tend to align to it. In some locations, SF3 units and SF1 reflections sole out on the TRB. In other locations, the TRB is displaced by these units.\nAerially extensive boundaries between principal seismic facies units likely represent noteworthy tectonic boundaries. Based on its position between, and relations with reflections within SF1 and SF2, domal shape and propensity to act as a detachment surface for SF3 facies units and SF1 reflections, we interpret the TRB to represent the top of a now folded detachment zone.\n\n\n\n6\nStructural elements and their expressions\nThe Utsira High is surrounded by Paleozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary basins (Fig. 1). These basins record several episodes of crustal extension that manifest as thick sedimentary growth packages related to steeply dipping normal faults. East of the Utsira High, the Stord Basin contains chiefly Permo-Triassic rift deposits. West of the Utsira High is the Viking Graben, containing a thick Jurassic-Cretaceous sedimentary package that expands its thickness towards the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. This fault separates the Viking Graben from the East Shetland Platform. In the continuation, we start with the Sele High, which offers the most complete stratigraphic succession.\n\n6.1\nSele High\nThe Sele High is a prominent basement culmination south of the Ling Depression, southeast of the Utsira High. It offers a comprehensive stratigraphy with distinct unconformities that form a framework for correlations to adjacent regions with incomplete successions. Several unconformities are observed in the deep stratigraphic section (Fig. 1); a) the top basement unconformity, which is peneplained in some areas while displaying a distinctly alpine topography elsewhere, b) erosional truncation of strata that pre-date the Permian (Devonian\/Carboniferous?) and c) the pre-Rotliegendes (Saalian) unconformity. The seismic facies of basement rocks within the Sele High is similar to the SF1 of the Utsira High with its transparent, low-amplitude, high-frequency reflective pattern.\n\n\n6.2\nLing depression to southern Utsira High\nThe southern slope of the Utsira High steepens into the Ling Depression (Fig. 1, 5c). Control on deep seismic facies becomes progressively difficult southwards because of a) the increasing depth of the basement-cover contact and b) the presence of a complexly structured and strongly reflective package of Late Permian Zechstein evaporites. High on the Utsira High-Ling Depression slope, where only a modest thickness of evaporites are present, a series of northwest-facing normal faults are observed. These listric faults bound depocenters that contain pre-Permian sedimentary successions and have a common detachment in SF1 basement rocks at approximately 4\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 6). This sub-horizontal detachment consists of a small group of similarly dipping reflections. The faults are corrugated with corrugation axes striking SW-NE. Corrugation fold wavelengths vary from ~1\u20135\u00a0km near fault \u201ca\u201d to ~6.5\u00a0km for fault \u201cb\u201d (Fig. 6).\n\n\n6.3\nUtsira High\nThe Utsira High is a basement high containing eroded remnants of Paleozoic-Mesozoic extensional basins (Figs. 3, 4, 5). The high is onlapped by Paleozoic to Cenozoic deposits while the perched basins contain Paleozoic to Upper Jurassic sediments (Halland et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2015). In seismic data, basement rocks within the Utsira High display three distinctly different seismic facies as described in the previous chapter. SF1 forms the depositional substrate for strata onlapping the high, with TRB along the boundary between SF1 and SF2. Some basin-bounding steep faults penetrate deeply into basement and displace the TRB (Fig. 4a); however, most basin-bounding faults sole out in various levels within basement rocks, most notably in the TRB. On the west flank of the Utsira High, faults that bound half grabens sole out on this surface (Fig. 3a, c). Similarly, on the east flank of the Utsira High, the deep part of the boundary fault to the Stord Basin sole out in the E-dipping TRB surface (Fig. 4a, b, 7b). Along the southern Utsira High, however, half-graben boundary faults sole out in a common detachment that is fully contained in the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 6). Overall, the TRB surface forms a dome underneath the Utsira High with a roughly N-S elongated crest as shown in Fig. 5. On a smaller scale, the dome is separated in at least two segments: a southern segment where the Utsira High is widest (~70\u201380\u00a0km) and a central narrower segment (~40\u00a0km). These segments are separated by a pronounced depression (Fig. 5d) that is roughly on trend with the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone (HSZ) that traces the southern extremity of the Stord Basin (Fig. 7a).\nThe TRB is folded about axes that strike E-W to NE-SW with wavelengths between 5 and 25\u00a0km (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 7). Folds are interpreted as corrugations on the detachment zone, and their long axes are assumed to be aligned according to the related tectonic regime. Hence, tectonic transport in this detachment zone likely occurred along axes oriented E-W to NE-SW (Fig. 7). Such transport-parallel folds, or corrugations, are well expressed in West Norway (Braathen et al., 2004; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001), where they appear within and below the major extensional detachments that record >50\u00a0km displacement. Corrugation axes and stretching lineations gradually rotate from E-W orientation to NE-SW trending towards the major M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex further north (Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001). Similarly, on the east flank of the Utsira High, the corrugation axes on the TRB surface change orientation from ~NE strike in the north to ~E strike near the extrapolated Hardangerfjord Shear Zone (Fig. 7a).\n\n\n6.4\nUtsira Shear Zone\nThe east-dipping Utsira Shear Zone is seen as a narrow SF3 rock body that forms the eastern boundary of the deep part of the Utsira High, demarcating the border to the Stord Basin, which contains a thick, predominantly Permo-Triassic sedimentary succession (Fig. 4). Updip, the shear zone grades into a brittle fault system that, depending on location, downthrows the top-basement surface 1\u20132\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 3) or approximately 2\u00a0km (Fig. 8d). Downdip, the shear zone converges with the east-dipping TRB surface, where it forms an SF3 upper boundary to SF2 S\u2013C structures (Fig. 3c, 7b, 8b). We see the corrugation folds on the TRB as closely related to the Utsira Shear Zone.\n\n\n6.5\nViking Graben\nThe Viking Graben is here considered a half-graben basin where a thick sedimentary succession, primarily consisting of Mesozoic sediments, are banked onto the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, on which we expand below. The eastern part of the Viking Graben coincides with the west Utsira flank, which is characterized by a basement-cover contact that becomes progressively steeper towards the west, in a dipslope that ultimately becomes truncated by the boundary fault (Fig. 3). Progressively older strata onlap the granitic basement westwards down the dipslope. These strata range in age from Paleogene near the peneplained top of central Utsira High to Permian and likely older Paleozoic strata further west (Fig. 8). The dipslope hosts Late Permian evaporites as manifested by diapiric structures (Fig. 3). These and older strata are contained within rotated half-graben basins bounded by rotated east-dipping normal faults. Noticeably, restoration juxtaposes the basal half-graben fill with Devonian packages of the Shetland Platform (see below). Several angular unconformities have been mapped on the west Utsira Flank; in addition to the top-basement unconformity there is an angular unconformity between highly compacted coarse clastic units on basement, and overlying mainly moderately lithified sandstones. This assemblage is separated by a composite angular unconformity from easterly to northerly onlapping Jurassic and Cretaceous to Paleogene units (Durand et al., 2020).\n\n\n6.6\nViking Graben Boundary Fault\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault is a large-magnitude listric normal fault that constitutes the boundary between the East Shetland Platform and the Viking Graben, dissecting much of the 9\u00a0s seismic sections used for this study. On certain seismic lines, steep reflections some distance into the footwall offset a reflective surface within seismically transparent basement rocks (Fig. 3a). Presumably, the offset reflection represents the interface between Devonian sedimentary units and crystalline basement. The deep part of the boundary fault, from 6.3 to 9\u00a0s TWT (~9\u201325\u00a0km), is slightly more gently dipping (Fig. 8), less so in depth-converted data (see below). The upper part of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault juxtaposes a footwall of SF1 crystalline basement hosting Devonian sedimentary units with a hanging wall of Jurassic to Cretaceous sedimentary packages, suggesting a minimum fault throw of 3\u00a0s TWT \/ 5\u00a0km (Fig. 8). The fault tips out in Cretaceous strata at approximately 2\u00a0s TWT (Fig. 3). SF3 basement rocks are identified in the immediate footwall of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. A relation between the fault and shear zone is indicated by similarly east-dipping SF3 fabric and fault reflection. Top-E extensional kinematics can be interpreted from S\u2013C structures within the SF3 fabric (Fig. 3b).\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\nInterpretations of basement structures of the Utsira High region expands on previously published work that address both the North Sea rift system and seismic facies of basement rocks (Fazlikhani et al., 2017; Fossen and Hurich, 2005; Gresseth et al., 2021; Lenhart et al., 2019; Peron-Pinvidic and Osmundsen, 2020; Phillips et al., 2016, 2019; Strugale et al., 2021; Torvela et al., 2013; Wiest et al., 2020). We show the relationships between basins, major faults and shear zones, warped intra-basement fabric and kinematic indicators in crystalline basement. In the following, we will discuss the post-Caledonian structural development of the greater Utsira High region seen in the light of these novel observations.\n\n7.1\nUtsira High metamorphic core complex\nImproved deep seismic imaging of the Utsira High has allowed for mapping of intra-basement reflections and subdivision of basement into seismic facies. Crudely put, the crystalline basement consists of an upper, low-reflective SF1 unit and a lower, medium-to-high-reflective SF2 unit. The TRB surface forms the boundary between the two units and is dome-shaped under the Utsira High. Additionally, narrow bands of SF3 that are interpreted as shear zones either cross-cut reflections in both the other units, are contained within the upper unit, or display a relationship with the other units where SF1 and\/or SF2 reflections converge with SF3 reflections. SF3 seismic units either 1) forms the downdip continuation of brittle, basin-bounding faults, 2) forms the d\u00e9collement onto which these faults sole, and\/or 3) traces the TRB surface, suggesting this surface represent a detachment.\nExhumation of metamorphic core complexes during extensional collapse of the Caledonides has been established for the Norwegian continental shelf (Gresseth et al., 2021; Henstra and Rotevatn, 2014; Osmundsen et al., 2021), the onshore-offshore transition (Lenhart et al., 2019; Wiest et al., 2020) and onshore West Norway (Braathen et al., 2000; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Wiest et al., 2020). It has been speculated that the Utsira High represents a metamorphic core complex exhumed in the footwall of the Utsira Shear Zone (Phillips et al., 2019). We substantiate the Utsira High as a metamorphic core complex, with a proposed structural development of the high and adjacent areas outlined in Figs. 9 and 10\n\n. The former summarizes observations made in a wide, approximately E-W oriented corridor across the Utsira High, while the latter presents a tentative chronology of tectonic events from Devonian to Permian based on the discussion below. The latter (Fig. 10) does not include Permo-Triassic and Jurassic-Cretaceous rift events, which would have been represented by steps 5 and 6 in the figure, respectively. We base our interpretations on these observations:\n\n1.\nThe TRB surface (detachment) is dome-shaped and has been dome-shaped at least since before Jurassic-Cretaceous rifting, as evidenced by our structural restoration of the Viking Graben Boundary Fault (Fig. 8).\n\n\n2.\nThere is significant and long-lived crustal uplift centered around the Utsira High. This is suggested by thinning of the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 5e) and by non-deposition and\/or erosion of significant parts of the Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary section as compared to, for instance, the Sele High, which preserves a thick pre-Permian sedimentary section (Fig. 1d). Further, contrary to the Utsira High, an alpine topography of the Top Basement surface is preserved in the Sele High, consistent with burial instead of exposure with subsequent peneplanation.\n\n\n3.\nSeismic fabrics of SF1 and SF2 immediately above and below the TRB, respectively, show morphological similarities and tend to rotate into parallelism with this surface, indicating its significance as a major detachment\/shear zone (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Lister and Davis, 1989). Furthermore, many faults and shear zones (SF3) root in the TRB (Figs. 3, 4). We interpret the TRB as a warped detachment.\n\n\n4.\nIn the southern Utsira High, an intra-SF1 detachment, which appears as a ramp-flat-ramp system, defines a lower boundary of steep pre-Permian growth-faults (Compare Fig. 4a with 4b and 4c). A location above maximum upwards migration of lower-middle crust suggests that rapid uplift of hot crust temporarily shifted the brittle-ductile transition upwards, before relocating to margins of the dome.\n\n\n\nExpected rapid exhumation of the Utsira High metamorphic core complex, similar to Devonian basement domes of mainland Norway (Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Engvik and Andersen, 2000; Terry et al., 2000; Terry and Robinson, 2003), would bring hot crust to a structurally high position towards the crest of the dome. Thermally weakened crust in higher positions can facilitate upward migration of detachments, consistent with the observation of a shallower detachment in the south flank of the Utsira High, contained entirely within the upper basement unit (SF1) (Fig. 6). Faults that sole out in this detachment bound half-grabens that contain pre-Permian sedimentary deposits (Fig. 6).\n\n\n7.2\nExtensional kinematics of the Utsira High\nCorrugations on faults rooting in the mentioned shallow detachment on the southern flank of the Utsira High indicate top-NE extensional tectonics (Fig. 6). Similarly, corrugations mapped in TRB detachment offer transport axes striking E-W to NE-SW, as identified in the eastern flank of the Utsira High, where the extensional east-dipping Utsira Shear Zone coincides with the TRB detachment. Corrugation folds oriented parallel to tectonic transport on detachments have been recognized in a variety of settings worldwide, including onshore west Norway and on the Norwegian continental shelf (Braathen et al., 2018; Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Gresseth et al., 2021; Kapp et al., 2008; Krabbendam and Dewey, 1998; Lister and Davis, 1989; Little et al., 2007; Osmundsen et al., 1998; Templeton, 2015). Taken together with the observed corrugations, we interpret tectonic transport towards the NE. However, immediately north of the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone, corrugation axes rotate and become parallel with the east-striking shear zone, suggesting it was actively exploited during exhumation of the Utsira High metamorphic core complex (Fig. 7a). Similar rotation in kinematic axes is well documented for West Norway, with a shift from E-W to NE-SW in vicinity of the M\u00f8re-Tr\u00f8ndelag Fault Complex (Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001).\nAs documented, improved deep seismic imaging makes it possible to separate between rock units within the crystalline basement in the Utsira High, qualified by differing reflection patterns. Noticeably, the lower basement unit (SF2) is dominated by patterns consistent with large S\u2013C shear fabrics along the flanks of the dome, capped by the TRB surface. These simple-shear S\u2013C fabrics show opposing kinematics on the dome flanks with top-E and top-W shear on east and west flanks, respectively (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 7). Additionally, the lower basement unit (SF2) displays more symmetrical anastomosing fabrics centrally within the dome (Fig. 3, 7d). This is consistent with patterns of pure-shear strain with vertical flattening, although this fabric is overprinted by predominantly east-dipping structures in some areas (Fig. 3c). This gross pattern can be explained in several ways;\n\n1.\nContemporaneous bi-directional simple-shear in the upper crust was decoupled from the uplifting lower-middle crust that experienced a pure-shear flattening regime. This observation substantiates that initial doming, perhaps from diapiric uplift of overthickened crust, caused or was associated with bi-directional shear in shallower crust. An analogue would be the bi-directional kinematics recorded on Devonian detachments flanking basement domes in Central Norway (Braathen et al., 2000, 2002).\n\n\n2.\nInitial bi-directional shear above an uplifting flattening regime was followed by lower-middle crust rollback during a subsequent shift to top-E shear. Similarly, vertical flattening by pure shear is documented for lower-middle crustal sections below the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone of Western Norway (Braathen and Erambert, 2014; Engvik and Andersen, 2000), with initial fabrics becoming uplifted and incorporated in top-W shear of the detachment (see also Fig. 9).\n\n\n\nRemnants of fault-bounded growth basins around the Utsira High generally show down-easterly kinematics with faults rooted in the TRB detachment, irrespective of position around the domal core complex. This top-easterly shear system rejuvenated the eastern flank of the dome and caused rollback in underlying units as unroofing progressed (Fig. 10). Importantly, reactivation of the TRB detachment along the eastern Utsira High endorse that S\u2013C shear fabric is best developed on the eastern dome limb (compare Fig. 7b with 7c), where the Utsira Shear Zone reactivates inherited fabrics. Models of rollback below major detachments is substantiated by Brun et al. (2018) (their fig. 11; see also Tirel et al., 2008) and corroborated in Braathen and Osmundsen (2020). Applying such models to the Utsira High, there would be westerly migration of deeper crust decoupled from an upper section experiencing top-easterly shear. Rollback kinematics with continued warping of detachments necessitate growth of new, steeper faults that either truncate or reactivate older structures (Braathen and Osmundsen, 2020; Brun et al., 2018; Lister and Davis, 1989; Miller et al., 1999; Osmundsen and P\u00e9ron-Pinvidic, 2018; Serck et al., 2021). Here, the proto-Viking Graben Boundary Fault\/shear zone truncates the TRB detachment, whereas the Utsira Shear Zone reactivates it because of its favorable orientation. A similar geometric-kinematic scenario has been described in the Snake Range of Nevada (Brun et al., 2018; Miller et al., 1999).\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault controls the mentioned crustal-scale rollover with a long dipslope down from the Utsira High towards the Viking Graben. Remains of fault-bounded growth basins mainly in the dipslope (e.g., prominent grabens of Solveig and Edvard Grieg fields) (Fig. 5c) are of Paleozoic age but shows local Jurassic-Cretaceous(?) reactivation (Figs. 1c, 3c). Our large-scale restoration (Fig. 8) hints at links between Devonian units of the East Shetland Platform (Patruno et al., 2019; Platt and Cartwright, 1999) and the hanging wall dipslope, suggesting deeper parts of the dipslope basins might contain remnants of Devonian depocenters. These units are significantly compacted where penetrated on the Utsira High (Durand et al., 2020), consistent with significant burial before uplift and rotation from core complex doming, with deep erosion resulting in truncation by an angular unconformity. Sandstones above the angular unconformity in deeply eroded basins on the Utsira High offer Triassic illite K\u2013Ar ages (Fredin et al., 2017). Signs of salt diapirism in the dipslope towards the Viking Graben suggests that accommodation was available for deposition of Late Permian evaporites, signaling Permian (re)activation of faults (Fig. 8c, d). A strong affiliation between the (proto-)Viking Graben Boundary Fault system and mapped evaporites substantiate this (Fig. 5b). Combined, these observations point towards Permo-Triassic fault activity that is preserved in the west and south flanks of the Utsira High. A tectonic evolution for the Sele High prior to Permo-Triassic rifting is suggested by the conserved, comprehensive Paleozoic stratigraphy and resolvable unconformities within the high: 1) Devonian Top basement unconformity, albeit with substantially less erosion than the peneplained Utsira High Top basement surface (Fig. 1d). 2) Devono-Carboniferous or intra-Carboniferous unconformity (not presented herein), indicating either that Devonian collapse tectonics persisted into the Carboniferous or a separate Carboniferous rift event. 3) The Saalian\/sub-Rotliegendes unconformity (Fig. 1d), commonly ascribed to deformation related to the Variscan Orogeny (e.g. Glennie, 1998).\nDevonian to Carboniferous shear zone-related unroofing events have been documented for West Norway (Eide et al., 1999) and later in Central Norway (Eide et al., 2002). This indicates a prolonged extensional episode that might have been overlooked in other studies concerning post-Caledonian extensional tectonics and has since received support (Templeton, 2015). Moreover, Kalani et al. (2020) argue for a Devonian to early Carboniferous extensional phase in the Egersund Basin, southeast of the Sele High (location in Fig. 1b), which by proximity suggests that unconformity 2) in the pre-Permian Sele High succession (described above) belongs to the same extensional phase. Heeremans and Faleide (2004) suggests the North Sea and Skagerrak Sea between Norway and Denmark is affected by late Carboniferous to Permian extensional tectonism, hence separated in time from Caledonian collapse tectonics that have been particularly well documented onshore west Norway (e.g. Andersen and Jamtveit, 1990; Osmundsen and Andersen, 2001; Wiest et al., 2020). For the Utsira High, we open the door for extending the phase of Caledonian collapse-related tectonics into the Carboniferous based on the 1) close relationship between pre-Permian basin bounding faults and major detachments that exhume within the Utsira High metamorphic core complex, and 2) strong similarities between detachment systems of our study area and detachment systems onshore west Norway (Eide et al., 1999; Templeton, 2015). A possible separate Carboniferous rift event cannot be resolved for the Utsira High based on our current dataset. Furthermore, the sub-Rotliegendes unconformity, as observed in the southern Utsira High (Fig. 6), is clearly affiliated with dome exhumation-related extensional faults as opposed to Variscan compressional tectonics. Hence, the Utsira High was either unaffected by Variscan tectonics or the metamorphic core complex exhumation provided a structural signature strong enough to render any Variscan tectonic features unresolvable.\n\n\n7.3\nJurassic-Cretaceous crustal-scale rollover\nThe Viking Graben Boundary Fault (Fig. 1c) separates the East Shetland Platform from the western dipslope of the Utsira High. Although seismic facies interpretations of East Shetland Platform basement rocks are challenging, seismic sections crossing the major fault indicate similar time thickness of the upper basement unit (SF1) on either side of the fault (Figs. 1c, 3). This observation emphasizes that the footwall and hanging wall have a shared tectonic history prior to major displacement on the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, as discussed above. In deeper parts of the Viking Graben, a thick Jurassic-Cretaceous growth wedge (Fig. 1c) above the Mid Jurassic surface rest on assumed Permo-Triassic and likely older Paleozoic growth-basin(s). The distribution of Late Permian Zechstein evaporites (Fig. 5b) strongly suggest a Permo-Triassic precursor to the Viking Graben Boundary Fault, which was reactivated and accumulated substantially more throw during the Jurassic-Cretaceous rift phase, when the Viking Graben became the main structural depression of the northern North Sea rift system.\nThe Top basement surface is relatively flat-lying on the Utsira High and of similar depth as the East Shetland Platform. It becomes progressively steeper as it rolls from the Utsira High into the Viking Graben and the Viking Graben Boundary Fault. This fault appears listric in TWT data, becoming lower-angled as it extends out of the seismic sections at 9\u00a0s TWT. In the depth-stretched seismic section, however, the listric nature of the fault is less convincing (Fig. 8d). Nevertheless, the shape of the dipslope from the Utsira High into Viking Graben suggest formation of a crustal-scale rollover, thereby substantiating a deep flat-lying detachment located below our current seismic coverage (> 9\u00a0s TWT), changing from ramp to flat approximately underneath the western extreme of the peneplained Utsira High as seen in e.g. Fig. 3b.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThis study of the Utsira High region along the southeastern margin of Viking Graben (North Sea) uses a large database long-offset, deep recording (9\u00a0s TWT) seismic data with substantially improved deep seismic imaging to outline the crustal scale structure and the regional tectonic evolution.\n\n1.\nDevonian (to Carboniferous) isostatic doming of overthickened crust caused uplift and erosion of basins and the nappe stack above a crustal rollback system during formation of the semi-symmetrical Utsira High metamorphic core complex. Dome-internal fabrics display vertical flattening kinematics below bi-directional shear systems evident by opposing shear-fabric kinematics on eastern and western flanks of the Utsira High.\n\n\n2.\nA major detachment boundary between upper and lower plate strain regimes coincide with upper low-reflective basement units (granites) above strongly reflective assemblages (Caledonian nappes). Temporal shifts in active detachment levels are ascribed to thermal weakening and strengthening. Detachments host tectonic transport-parallel corrugations that strike E-W to NE-SW, with top-easterly kinematics consistent with growth-fault basins on top of basement.\n\n\n3.\nRejuvenation of older faults and basins are noticeable for the Permo-Triassic rift episode. The prominent Utsira Shear Zone soles out in an older, rotated shear zone along the east flank of the Utsira High, enhancing top-E shear fabrics from preceding extensional phases.\n\n\n4.\nFor the Jurassic-Cretaceous rift episode, major rift-faulting mainly on the Viking Graben Boundary Fault is connected to thick growth wedges in the Viking Graben. This faulting establishes a crustal-scale rollover from the Utsira High downslope into the Viking Graben.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nChristopher S\u00e6b\u00f8 Serck: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing \u2013 original draft, Writing \u2013 review & editing, Visualization.

Sub-vertical magma conduits such as dykes and pipes transport magma upward, whereas sub-horizontal conduits such as sills and laccoliths lead to substantial lateral transport, storage or stalling of magma (Castro et al., 2016; Magee et al., 2016; Galland et al., 2018), which can eventually evolve and form shallow magma reservoirs (Rocchi et al., 2002; Rocchi et al., 2010; Sigmarsson et al., 2011; Castro et al., 2016). The emplacement of sills and laccoliths also trigger significant deformation of the Earth's surface (Minakami et al., 1951; Donnadieu and Merle, 2001; Kennedy et al., 2012; van Wyk de Vries et al., 2014; Castro et al., 2016; Magee et al., 2017).\nThe mechanisms controlling magma accumulation and storage in laccoliths depend to a great extent on the deformation mechanism of the overburden (Corry, 1988). One end-member model proposed to explain the emplacement of laccoliths is based on the elastic bending of overlying strata, which are considered as a thin, stiff plate (e.g., Pollard and Johnson, 1973; Koch et al., 1981; Kerr and Pollard, 1998; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Michaut, 2011; Scheibert et al., 2017). This model end-member is widely implemented because the mathematical formulation of a thin, stiff bending plate is relatively easy to implement. This model end-member formulation is valid only for very shallow laccoliths (depth-to-diameter ratio H\/D\u00a0<\u00a00.1) with low thickness-to-diameter aspect ratios of the intrusions (T\/D\u00a0<\u00a00.02) (Ventsel and Krauthammer, 2002). However, most laccoliths documented on Earth do not fulfill these geometrical conditions (Corry, 1988; Cruden et al., 2018), as most laccoliths exhibit higher values of H\/D, and some intrusions are almost as thick as they are wide (e.g., Minakami et al., 1951; Jackson and Pollard, 1990; Jackson, 1997; Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; van Wyk de Vries et al., 2014; Mattsson et al., 2018; Burchardt et al., 2019). In addition, field observations show that significant fracturing and faulting (i.e., inelastic deformation) can accommodate doming of laccolith overburdens (de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2016; Mattsson et al., 2018), as accounted for in the end-member \u201cpunched laccolith\u201d model where the overburden lifts up like a rigid piston (Gilbert, 1877; Corry, 1988; Schmiedel et al., 2019).\nClassical views and mechanical models of sill and laccolith-induced doming, also called forced folding, typically consider symmetrical doming of the overburden (Corry, 1988; Jackson and Pollard, 1990; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Magee et al., 2017; Scheibert et al., 2017). Nevertheless, geological observations (Witkind, 1973; Rom\u00e1n-Berdiel et al., 1995; de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2007) and geodetic measurements (Amelung et al., 2000; J\u00f3nsson et al., 2005) suggest that uplift of the intrusion overburdens can be strongly asymmetrical and accommodated by a peripheral fault on one side of the dome, the so-called trapdoor mechanism. However, little constraints are known about the structure of laccolith-induced trapdoor dome.\nReconstructing the structure of both a laccolith and its associated overburden dome is challenging because they occur at scales of several kilometers (Rocchi et al., 2002; Michel et al., 2008; Leuthold et al., 2012; Westerman et al., 2018). Field studies are limited by exposure conditions, where only parts of the intrusion or parts of the dome of the overburden are exposed (Fig. 1\n; de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2016; Mattsson et al., 2018). Recently, seismic data has been used extensively to explore the structure of volcanic plumbing systems, in particular sills and laccoliths and their associated domes, due to its ability to image kilometer-scale subsurface structures at a resolution of some tens of meters (Trude et al., 2003; Hansen and Cartwright, 2006; Jackson et al., 2013; Magee et al., 2013; Schmiedel et al., 2017b; Reynolds et al., 2021). Nevertheless, even though seismic data allows good imaging of sills, thin laccoliths and simple dome structures, it is less effective for imaging thicker laccoliths associated with high amplitude and structurally complex domes (Fig. 1; Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; Delpino et al., 2014; Mark et al., 2018).\nIn this paper, we describe the structure of a laccolith-induced dome by integrating geological field mapping, 3D seismic data and borehole data. The case study we present is the Pampa Amarilla dome structure, located in the Malarg\u00fce fold-and-thrust belt in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, Argentina. We highlight the added value of integrating field observations with subsurface data, which allowed us to propose a robust reconstruction of the dome and of its underlying laccolith.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting of Pampa Amarilla\n\n2.1\nGeological evolution of the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin\nThe Pampa Amarilla structure is located in the northern Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, southern Mendoza province, ~50\u00a0km to the south of the town of Malarg\u00fce and 20\u00a0km to the east of the village of Bardas Blancas (Fig. 2A). The Neuqu\u00e9n Basin evolved from an extensional basin in the Triassic-Jurassic-Early Cretaceous to a foreland basin in the Late Cretaceous, and comprises a prolific hydrocarbon province with various proven hydrocarbon plays (Vergani et al., 1995; Howell et al., 2005; Veiga et al., 2020), including producing andesitic sills emplaced in organic-rich shales (Spacapan et al., 2020).\nThe geodynamic evolution of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin occurred in three main phases. Initiation of the basin started in the Triassic-Jurassic as a series of elongated rifts forming isolated depocentres (Vergani et al., 1995; Yagupsky et al., 2008) (Fig. 3\n). During the early Jurassic, the Rifting phase subsequently transformed into a back-arc basin dominated by regional thermal subsidence (Sag phase; Fig. 3). This led to the deposition of marine sediments of the Mendoza group, which includes organic-rich shales of the Vaca Muerta and Agrio Fms. These formations constitute two of the main source rocks of the basin. The Vaca Muerta and Agrio Fms. are separated in the study area by the carbonaceous Chachao Fm. (Fig. 3). The end of the Sag phase is marked by the deposition of the Rayoso Gr., which includes gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm. The Huitr\u00edn Fm. is topped by a 5- to 10-m thick limestone of the La Tosca Mb., and claystone and fine-grained sandstone of the Rayoso Fm. (Fig. 3).\nIn the late Cretaceous, the tectonic regime changed to compression, initiating a foreland basin phase marked by the deposition of the thick continental sandstones and conglomerates of the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. (Fig. 3). This stage created a series of fold-and-thrust belts including the Malarg\u00fce fold-and-thrust belt through reactivation and inversion of the rift-related normal faults as well as older basement faults (Manceda and Figueroa, 1995; Giambiagi et al., 2009; Mescua and Giambiagi, 2012; Mescua et al., 2014; Barrionuevo et al., 2019; Fennell et al., 2020). The study area is located on the gently-dipping western limb of the Malarg\u00fce Anticline (Fig. 2B).\nDuring the Foreland basin stage, particularly the northern part of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin experienced repeated episodes of extensive volcanism and magmatic intrusion of the sedimentary succession (Nullo et al., 2002; Kay et al., 2006). Magmatic activity in the eastern Malarg\u00fce fold-and-thrust belt has been separated into two cycles: a late Oligocene to middle Miocene Molle Eruptive Cycle and a middle Miocene to Pliocene Huinc\u00e1n Eruptive Cycle (Fig. 3). The Molle Eruptive Cycle is associated with retroarc volcanism and the Huinc\u00e1n Eruptive Cycle to arc volcanism (Groeber, 1946; Baldauf et al., 1997; Nullo et al., 2002; Combina and Nullo, 2011; Litvak et al., 2015). Both cycles are characterized by predominantly basaltic and andesitic lava flow sequences and subvolcanic bodies such as sills, dykes and laccoliths (Baldauf et al., 1997; Combina and Nullo, 2011; Spacapan et al., 2016, 2017; Spacapan et al., 2020). The youngest volcanism is located toward the east, in the Quaternary Payenia Basaltic Province (Galland et al., 2007; Ramos and Folguera, 2011; S\u00f8ager et al., 2013).\nMagmatism in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin has substantial economic implications, as it deeply affected local petroleum systems in several ways. First, it provided the necessary heat to generate hydrocarbons from the Vaca Muerta and Agrio Fms., which are mainly immature in the study area (Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; Spacapan et al., 2018a; Spacapan et al., 2020). Secondly, the intrusions themselves act as naturally fractured reservoirs, constituting atypical petroleum systems such as the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) oil fields, south of the study area (Schiuma and Llamb\u00edas, 2014; Rodriguez Monreal et al., 2009; Witte et al., 2012; Spacapan et al., 2020).\n\n\n2.2\nThe Pampa Amarilla structure\nA thick igneous body at Pampa Amarilla, in the Agua Botada area, has been known since 1937 after the drilling of well PA.x-2, which crossed ~100\u00a0m of andesite without reaching the bottom of the intrusion. The first clear documentation of an anticline structure at Pampa Amarilla was on a geological map by a geologist commission of YPF (1976) (YPF is the national Argentinian oil company Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales). The map displayed outward-dipping bedding measurements (Fig. 2B), as well as a subcircular outcrop pattern of the Huitr\u00edn and Agrio Fms. in the core of the anticline, surrounded by outcrops of red beds of the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. (Fig. 2B). The geological map of YPF (1976) provided sparse bedding measurements (Fig. 2B), which does not permit the extent, shape and amplitude of the structure to be well constrained.\nThe map of YPF (1976) highlighted that the Pampa Amarilla structure is located at the boundary between two structural domains: to the north, bedding in the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. dips gently toward the west, whereas to the south, bedding in the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. dips gently toward the south (Fig. 2). Probably on this basis, Kraemer et al. (2011) interpreted this structure as a \u201csatellite back-thrust structure developed at the southern plunge of the Malarg\u00fce anticline\u201d of tectonic origin. However, the study area is also located along the Bardas Blancas tectonic lineament, which is an inherited structural discontinuity between two Jurassic half-grabens (Manceda and Figueroa, 1993; Yagupsky et al., 2007), and along the NW-trending Huemul lineament, which Barrionuevo et al. (2019) interpret as recording strike-slip movement during the Miocene. Barrionuevo et al. (2019) proposed that doming of Neuqu\u00e9n basin strata at Pampa Amarilla was the result of the intrusion of the andesite found in well PA.x-2. Our study further demonstrates that the Pampa Amarilla structure is dominantly a laccolith-induced dome, even if we cannot rule out that a minor tectonic component contributed to its development.\nIn the Agua Botada sector, Cenozoic intrusive rocks correspond to sills, subvolcanic bodies and dykes with predominantly intermediate compositions (Schiuma, 1994). Available K\/Ar ages on dykes in the study area yielded early- to middle-Miocene ages (17.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 and 14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0Ma; Valencio et al., 1970). Andesitic and basaltic andesite sills are predominantly emplaced in units with fine-grained sedimentary intervals, particularly in the organic-rich shale of the Vaca Muerta and Agrio Fms. (Schiuma, 1994; Spacapan et al., 2017; Spacapan et al., 2018b; Barrionuevo et al., 2019; Spacapan et al., 2020). Miocene to Quaternary andesitic and basaltic subvertical dykes are abundant in the easternmost Malarg\u00fce fold-and-thrust belt, especially those radiating from the Cerro (Mount) Tronquimalal and Cerro Mirano intrusive complexes (Fig. 2B). Away from these intrusive centers, dykes outcropping in the study area exhibit mainly NW-SE and E-W orientations (Berm\u00fadez and Delpino, 1989; Spacapan et al., 2016; Barrionuevo et al., 2019), suggesting that their emplacement was controlled by pre-existing faults and syn-emplacement tectonic stresses, folding and faulting (Spacapan et al., 2016; Barrionuevo et al., 2019).\nNote that the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin stratigraphy includes two evaporite formations (Late Jurassic Auquilco Fm. and Lower Cretaceous Huitr\u00edn Fm.; Fig. 3). Evaporite sequences are notoriously associated with salt tectonics, including salt diapirs that can trigger doming similar to that observed at Pampa Amarilla (e.g., Alsop et al., 2000). However, we can rule out that salt tectonics is responsible for the Pampa Amarilla dome for the following arguments: the Huitr\u00edn Fm. is included in the structure, indicating that if it was a salt diapir, it would be rooted in the Auquilco Fm. However, Pampa Amarilla is located in proximal parts of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin where the Auquilco Fm. is thin (thickness\u00a0<\u00a025\u00a0m; Fig. 5) and laterally replaced by carbonates.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods and data\n\n3.1\nField mapping and drone surveys\nWe completed detailed field structural mapping of the well exposed Pampa Amarilla structure, which intersects the thin Mesozoic Huitr\u00edn and Rayoso Fms. of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, in addition to the uppermost Agrio Fm. and the lowermost Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. (Fig. 3). The level of exposure and outcrop quality allowed us to map several stratigraphic contacts almost continuously: Top Agrio Fm.\/base Huitr\u00edn Fm., Huitr\u00edn gypsum\/La Tosca Mb., Top La Tosca Mb.\/base Rayoso Fm., and Top Rayoso Fm.\/base Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. The competent La Tosca Mb. is resistant to erosion, and crops out extensively. We also identified a unique stratigraphic marker within the gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm., namely a\u00a0~\u00a050\u00a0cm-thick layer of hard, finely laminated gypsum, which separates yellowish (below) and white (above) gypsum deposits (Fig. 3). We collected numerous bedding measurements, notably along the margins of the structure in order to detect sharp bedding changes potentially associated with faulting.\nPhotogrammetric drone surveys were carried out over the whole Pampa Amarilla structure using a Phantom3 Advanced drone (built-in camera, 12 megapixels). The resulting photographs were processed using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry software to compute (1) a high-resolution orthorectified image, and (2) a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area (topographic data in Fig. 6). This data was essential for interpretation and lateral interpolation of the field observations.\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic and well data\nThe western half of the Pampa Amarilla dome is covered by a 3D seismic survey associated with hydrocarbon exploration in the Agua Botada block (Fig. 2B). This high-quality seismic data allows a good reconstruction of the subsurface structure north, west and south of the Pampa Amarilla dome (Fig. 4\n). To the north and to the west, bedding in Mesozoic units dips gently to the west. To the south, Mesozoic units dip gently to the south, as documented in the YPF (1976) map (Fig. 2B). At the location of the Pampa Amarilla dome, the seismic data loses coherency, likely due to imaging difficulties related to the dome structural complexity combined with near-surface high velocity layers (carbonates and evaporites) (Fig. 4). Note that the structure of the Mesozoic units outside the Pampa Amarilla dome is simple with no evidence of faulting. In particular, there is neither seismic nor field evidence of a thrust fault as indicated by YPF (1976) and Barrionuevo et al. (2019) (the proposed Casa de Piedra Thrust).\nIn addition to the 3D seismic data, geophysical borehole data from two wells have been included in the study (PA.x-2 and PA.x-6; see locations on Fig. 2). Well PA.x-6 displays various geophysical measurements which were used to pick the depth of stratigraphic formation tops with great accuracy (Fig. 5\n). In addition, this well is within the 3D seismic block, which is convenient to apply a simple vertical geometric scaling of the seismic data (see section 5). We took the data from well PA.x-6 to constrain the thickness and depth of the sedimentary units affected by the Pampa Amarilla dome. We extrapolated the thicknesses of the Mesozoic units measured in well PA.x-6 to the rest of the study area. Given the relatively small extent of the study area, we consider this to be valid first order approximation.\nIn contrast to well PA.x-6, well PA.x-2 is old (1937\u20131938), without geophysical log measurements, and the interpretation of the unit thickness and depth was only derived from rock chip cuttings. Even though this well is located in the middle of the dome structure, the uncertainties in the unit depths are too large for it to be useful for reconstruction of the Pampa Amarilla dome. The only data we used from this well is the depth of the roof of the igneous body at 416\u00a0m, which is seen as a major transition in the rock chip cuttings data.\n\n\n\n4\nGeological observations\n\n4.1\nMain stratigraphic contacts\nThe lithological contrasts between the exposed units at the Pampa Amarilla dome, in addition to the good outcrop quality (Fig. 3), makes mapping of stratigraphic contacts relatively easy. The core of the dome is dissected by an almost E-W trending valley, subsequently referred to as the \u201cCentral Valley\u201d (Fig. 6\n). These exposed stratigraphic units are, from bottom to top, (1) the Agrio Fm. that consists of distal carbonate-rich pelite deposits, (2) the Huitr\u00edn Fm. that consists of gypsum deposits topped by limestones of the La Tosca Mb., and (3) the Rayoso Fm. comprising light brown clay to very fine-grained sand deposits (Fig. 3). These units are covered by coarse red sandstone and conglomerate of the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr.\nStratigraphic contacts between these units are easily mapped along the northwestern, northern, and eastern edges of the dome, but are covered by Quaternary deposits on the southeastern edge of the dome (Fig. 6). The main stratigraphic marker in the study area is the thin carbonate of the La Tosca Mb., which controls the most prominent topographic features of the dome. From there, we mapped the Top La Tosca Mb.\/base Rayoso Fm. contact in detail. The fine-grained Rayoso Fm. outcrops poorly, but the transition between the top Rayoso Fm.\/base Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. is well marked by a dark grey conglomerate bed, which can be followed in the landscape.\n\n\n4.2\nMapping of bedding\nWe collected a high density of bedding plane measurements, especially where bedding orientation is observed to change sharply (Fig. 6). Such measurements are not equally straightforward in all the units exposed in the area, where sandstone to conglomerate beds of the Neuqu\u00e9n Gr. are highly irregular and very few well-defined beds are exposed in the Rayoso Fm.\nDue to the scale of the mapping, the structure above the intrusion was characterized in greater detail than previous studies, documenting sharp variations in bedding orientation. Steeply-dipping bedding planes were measured along the western edge of the dome (up to 70\u00b0; Fig. 7E), in good agreement with the narrow outcrop width of the Rayoso Fm. (Fig. 6). Along the western edge of the dome, bedding transitions from steeply to gently-dipping (<15\u00b0) over a distance of 200\u2013300\u00a0m only. Sub-vertical layers of the Agrio Fm. (84\u00b0) are observed close to the center of the dome, a few tens of meters from the gently-dipping La Tosca Mb. in the southern limb of the dome (Fig. 6). In contrast, bedding in the eastern limb dip very gently, in agreement with large outcrop width of the La Tosca Mb and Rayoso Fm. (Fig. 6). The bedding measurements indicate that the Pampa Amarilla dome is strongly asymmetric.\nThe carbonate layers of the La Tosca Mb. exhibit numerous short wavelength (<10\u00a0m) folds. We inferred that these structures could not be related to larger-scale deformation, but instead related to folding due to the detachment of the beds of La Tosca Mb. with respect to the underlying gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm.\n\n\n4.3\nDeformational structures\nA number of deformational structures in the Mesozoic sedimentary formations are associated with the Pampa Amarilla dome structure. These structures provide insights on the shape and deformational style of the dome.\n\nFaults. An E-W striking, steeply northward-dipping normal fault with an offset of several meters is observed continuously along the northern scarp of the Central Valley (Fig. 7B). We interpreted several other faults based on breaks in stratigraphy and sharp variations in bedding dips (Figs. 6 and 7).\n\nFolds. Folds can be observed at different scales. At relatively large scale (>100\u00a0m), on the western edge of the dome, an eastward increase in dip from ~10\u00b0 to ~60\u00b0 indicates substantial dome-parallel bending of the strata of the Agrio to Rayoso Fm. Dome-parallel, ENE-WSW trending meter-scale folds occur in the Rayoso Fm. (Fig. 7F,G).\n\nDuctile foliation. A ductile foliation is observed in the gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm. (Fig. 7D). Such ductile deformation was only observed along the western edge of the dome, i.e. where the bedding is the steepest (Fig. 6). The foliation planes contain a down-dip lineation indicating E-W stretching perpendicular to the edge of the dome at this locality. Because of the very local expression of this ductile deformation, we interpret these structures as a result of shearing along the gypsum during dome growth.\n\n\n4.4\nIgneous intrusions\nA number of E-W trending, variably exposed, fine-grained andesitic dykes are observed traversing the dome (Fig. 6) (Barrionuevo et al., 2019). A few sills are also observed in the Mesozoic sedimentary units. The most prominent sill is located at the eastern edge of the dome (Fig. 6). It is made of a very coarse-grained andesite, with several centimeters size amphibole phenocrysts. It was emplaced at the contact between the top La Tosca Mb. and the base Rayoso Fm., clearly controlled by the lithological contrast between these two formations. Its thickness is challenging to estimate, because the sill and the La Tosca\/Rayoso stratigraphic contacts are almost parallel to the topography. The distinct phenocrysts sizes in the dykes and the sill show that the magmas were injected during distinct pulses of magmas of distinct differentiation histories.\n\n\n4.5\nSummary of geological observations\nThe main conclusions from our geological observations are the following:\n\n-\nDeformation of the Mesozoic units is restricted to the vicinity of the dome. From this we conclude that the Pampa Amarilla dome is a local structure associated with an underlying igneous intrusion, and not a tectonic structure;\n\n\n-\nThe dome has an asymmetric structure, with a steeply-dipping western edge and a shallow-dipping eastern edge;\n\n\n-\nSeveral faults dissect the center of the dome. There may be many more faults in the central part that are not exposed.\n\n\n\nThese geological observations are not sufficient to constrain the shape, extent and thickness of the underlying intrusion responsible for the formation of the Pampa Amarilla dome. The geological data are integrated with 3D seismic and well data below to construct structural cross sections.\n\n\n\n5\nStructural cross sections\nWe constructed four cross sections across the Pampa Amarilla dome. The E-W and N-S oriented cross sections follow the in-line 390 and cross-line 354 seismic profiles, respectively. The SW-NE Profile1 and NW-SE Profile2 were chosen to intersect the approximate center of the dome. Note that the E-W\u00a0L390 profile is located 100 to 200\u00a0m south of wells PA.x-2 and PA.x-6. We chose this location to incorporate the faults and observed stratigraphic contacts south of the Quaternary cover of the Central Valley (Fig. 6). Note that the structure at the location of well PA.x-6 is simple, with gently dipping strata to the west (Figs. 2B and 4). Therefore, the depths of the formation tops in well PA.x-6 can be confidently extrapolated to the location of E-W cross section L390.\n\n5.1\nVertical scaling of seismic data\nSince the seismic data are only available in two-way travel time, we performed a time-to-depth conversion in order to be able to integrate it with the field data. Note that where abundant borehole and check-shot survey data are available, this conversion is typically performed using advanced seismic interpretation software. However, because only one modern well is available, we carried out a manual vertical scaling, using the following steps (summarized in Fig. 8\n):\n\n-\nA high-resolution topographic map of the area was computed from the photogrammetric drone survey images.\n\n\n-\nTopographic profiles were constructed along the seismic profiles going through well PA.x-6, and the depth of the top Huitr\u00edn Fm. in the well was integrated with the topographic data (Fig. 8, upper left).\n\n\n-\nIn a seismic interpretation program, the topographic map was converted into time to be integrated with the 3D seismic cube. Thus, topographic profiles can be incorporated into seismic profiles (Fig. 8, lower left).\n\n\n-\nThe prominent top Huitr\u00edn Fm. reflector was interpreted on the selected seismic profiles (orange line Fig. 8, lower left).\n\n\n-\nThe vertical scales of these seismic profiles were linearly transformed such that both (1) the time-converted topography matched the true topography and (2) the position of the top Huitr\u00edn Fm. reflector matched the depth of top Huitr\u00edn Fm. in the well (Fig. 8, right);\n\n\n-\nWe used the seismic profile at the location of the well to adjust the vertical scale of the other profiles used to construct the four cross sections.\n\n\n\nGiven that the various lithologies of the local stratigraphy have distinct geophysical properties, this linear transformation of the vertical scale of the seismic data is a crude approximation of reality. However, the structure to the west of the dome is a simple monocline and the calculated dip angle of the reflectors match the bedding surface measurements very well (~15\u00b0; Figs. 2B and 8). Furthermore, the aim of this re-scaling of the seismic data is not to calculate the depth of all units, but to constrain the structure (i.e. the dip angle) of the main stratigraphic contacts.\n\n\n5.2\nConstruction of the structural cross sections\nConstruction of the structural cross sections followed 5 main steps, which are illustrated with cross section L390 (Fig. 9\n).\nStep 1. Vertical scaling of the seismic profile, following the method described in Section 5.1 and Fig. 8 (Fig. 9A).\nStep 2. On the topographic profile of the cross section, we placed the mapped stratigraphic contacts and the bedding measurements. In addition, the locations of the faults crossed by the section are also marked (F on Fig. 9B).\nStep 3. Using a vertical stratigraphic column defined by the thickness of the units logged in well PA.x-6 (see Fig. 5), and assuming that the unit thicknesses remain constant across the study area, we extrapolate the depth of the unit contacts along the cross sections (Fig. 9C). The same procedure was applied to the Top Huitr\u00edn Fm. seismic reflector outside the Pampa Amarilla dome (Fig. 9C).\nStep 4. We laterally interpolated the geological horizons to reconstruct part of the structure (Fig. 9D).\nStep 5. The geometry of the dome and the underlying intrusion are interpreted at the final step. This step is the most interpretative. First, well PA.x-2 data indicates that the roof of the Pampa Amarilla igneous body is located near the bottom contact of the Vaca Muerta Fm. In the cross section displayed in Fig. 9D, it is clear that the entire stratigraphic succession in the dome is significantly uplifted with respect to the succession west of the dome, but the base of the intrusion is not resolved. We filled this interpretation gap by correlating this cross section with the other cross sections, especially the N-S trending X354 cross section, on which the top Huitr\u00edn Fm. reflector is well resolved on the northern and southern sides of the dome (Fig. 5B). Along profile X354, we applied Step 1 to Step 4 of the procedure described above, and we interpolated the base Vaca Muerta Fm. between both sides of the dome, assuming that the base of the intrusion coincides with the base Vaca Muerta Fm. The depth of the intrusion's base contact on cross section X354, at the crossing point between cross sections L390 and X354, defines a marker point for the basal contact of the intrusion on cross section L390.\n\n\n5.3\nCross sections\n\nFig. 2 shows the locations of the cross sections presented in Fig. 10\n.\n\nCross section cross-line 354. This cross section N-S oriented crosses the dome near its centre. There is no significant depth difference of the Vaca Muerta, Chachao and Agrio Formations between the northern and the southern domains of the dome. Although there is a gentle dip difference between the southern and northern parts of the dome, it is not possible to identify a vertical offset. This strongly suggests that the deformation observed in the study area is only related to the emplacement of the laccolith.\nWhen compared to the known thickness of the Agrio to Vaca Muerta Fms., the depth of the roof of the intrusion drilled in well Pa.x-2 suggests that the laccolith was emplaced close to the bottom of the Vaca Muerta Fm. By interpolating the bottom of the Vaca Muerta Fm. from north to south, it is possible to estimate the amplitude of the dome, which is considered to be a good proxy for the thickness of the laccolith, close to 400\u00a0m. This allows the depth of the bottom of the intrusion to be estimated, which is consistent with the interpolated base of the Vaca Muerta Fm. across the dome.\nThe seismic data and the geological map indicate a\u00a0~\u00a0400\u00a0m depth difference of the top Huitr\u00edn Fm., which suggests that the northern edge of the dome is faulted. This interpretation is supported by the local folding and faulting observed in the Rayoso Fm. (Fig. 7F,G).\nThe exact structure of the southern edge of the dome is unclear. No evidence of faulting is observed at the surface. The structure of this part of the dome is the least constrained of the study area. Nevertheless, the ~400\u00a0m depth difference between the top Huitr\u00edn Fm. mapped in the field and that identified in the subsurface data indicate significant differential uplift over a small distance, implying that the overlaying strata experienced significant shear strain, likely accommodated by faulting. This indirect evidence of deformation makes the distribution of deformational structures quite speculative due to the lack of exposed structures.\nThe observed deformation and the cross sections suggest that the N-S dimension of the laccolith is ~2\u00a0km.\n\nCross section in-line 390. The structure of the dome along this E-W cross section is asymmetric, with a strongly deformed western edge and a gently-dipping eastern edge (Fig. 10). The significant deformation and the sharp depth difference of the Mesozoic units at the western edge of the dome strongly suggests that it is faulted along one major fault or several smaller faults.\nThe Mesozoic units at the eastern edge of the dome are structurally higher than to the west of the dome (Fig. 10), suggesting that the laccolith extends beyond the mapped area to the east. The asymmetric deformation of the dome strongly suggests that the uplift was accommodated by a trapdoor mechanism: most of the uplift was accommodated by the fault at the western edge, while the overburden to the east was rotated upward and only gently deformed.\nThe cross section suggests that the E-W dimension of the laccolith is at least 3\u00a0km. Compared to the N-S profile along cross-line 354, we infer that the laccolith is elliptical in shape on map view, with a 3\u00a0km long axis trending E-W and a 2\u00a0km short axis trending N-S.\n\nProfile1 and Profile 2. These profiles confirm the interpretations of cross sections L390 and X354. The faults observed in the field suggest that the trapdoor structure at the western and southwestern edges of the dome has been accommodated by several faults.\n\n\n\n6\nInterpretation\n\n6.1\nLaccolith shape and deformation style of overburden\nThe main assumption for reconstructing the shape of the subsurface Pampa Amarilla laccolith is that there was no significant compaction of the overburden associated with the emplacement. This assumption is supported by the fact that the emplacement depth of the laccolith was between 3000\u00a0m and 4000\u00a0m at the time of emplacement, i.e. before folding and uplift of the Malarg\u00fce anticline (Barrionuevo et al., 2019). At these depths, the host rock formations would have been already compacted. However, we cannot rule out some minor syn-emplacement and post-emplacement compaction, which might affect the reconstruction of the Pampa Amarilla dome and underlying laccolith.\nThe shape of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith is inferred to be asymmetrical, with a maximum T\u00a0~\u00a0400\u00a0m thickness in its western part, and thinning toward the east with a wedge shape (Figs. 10 and 11\n). With a minimum E-W length of D\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0km, the laccolith exhibits a thickness-to-length ratio T\/D\u00a0~\u00a00.13, which is in the typical range for felsic laccoliths (Fig. 12\n) (Corry, 1988; Cruden et al., 2018). This aspect ratio is one to two orders of magnitude higher than most sheet intrusions, such as dykes and mafic sills, the typical values of T\/D ranging between 10\u22122 and 10\u22124 (Fig. 12) (Rubin, 1995; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Cruden et al., 2018). This value of T\/D\u00a0~\u00a00.13 indicates that the Pampa Amarilla laccolith is much fatter (i.e., higher thickness-to-diameter aspect ratio) than sheet-shaped sills, and suggests that its emplacement results from a different mechanism than that of sills.\nThis value of T\/D is compatible with the observed intense deformation of the overburden, given that 400\u00a0m of uplift must be accommodated over <3\u00a0km. The overall structure of the dome is typical of a trapdoor, with a clear peripheral fault cross cutting its western, northwestern and southwestern edges (Figs. 10 and 11). The very minor deformation observed in the central part of the dome strongly suggests that it was titled to the east as a result of differential thickening of the underlying laccolith.\nThe main boundary fault of the dome is visible at its western edge. However, it is likely that the northern and southern edges of the domes are partly faulted, even if faults are not exposed at the surface. We can estimate whether a fault can be expected by defining the local vertical shear strain \u03b3\n\nv\n\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394h\/\u0394x along the edges of the dome, where \u0394h is the uplift difference and \u0394x is the distance over which \u0394h is accommodated. On the N-S striking section (Fig. 10), the differential uplift at the northern edge of the dome is estimated to be \u0394h\u00a0~\u00a0200\u00a0m, accommodated over a short distance \u0394x\u00a0<\u00a0200\u00a0m (Fig. 10), leading to an estimate of \u03b3\n\nv\n\u00a0~\u00a0100%. Such shear strain value cannot be accommodated by elastic bending, and faulting is expected, as evidenced by the tight folds observed in the Rayoso Fm. at the expected fault location (Fig. 7F,G). The southern edge of the dome on the N-S striking section is less pronounced than the northern edge, with a differential uplift \u0394h\u00a0~\u00a0300\u00a0m accommodated over a distance \u0394x\u00a0~\u00a0700\u00a0m, leading to estimate of \u03b3\n\nv\n\u00a0~\u00a050%. Although this local shear strain value is lower than that estimated at the northern boundary, it is much higher than critical strain required for rock failure (<1%; e.g., Jaeger et al., 2009; Renard et al., 2019). We thus expect faulting, or distributed damage, to affect the southern edge of the dome. Nevertheless, our geological observations and subsurface data are not sufficient to constrain the shape of the southern boundary fault.\nBoth the N-S and E-W cross sections provide very different pictures of the structure of the laccolith and associated dome (Fig. 10): the E-W cross section highlights a very asymmetrical trapdoor structure, whereas the N-S cross section displays a more symmetrical structure with both edges likely faulted. Such a difference reflects the complex 3-dimensional geometry of both the laccolith and the associated dome, which cannot be captured by a single cross section.\nGypsum within the Huitr\u00edn Fm. exhibits prominent ductile deformation along the western edge of the dome, i.e. where it is the most deformed. The foliation within the gypsum is parallel to the strata tilted by the doming, consistent with shearing associated with differential uplift of the dome with respect to the surrounding strata. There is no tectonic structure that can be linked with such foliation in the study area (Fig. 2)(Barrionuevo et al., 2019). We therefore interpret this ductile foliation to be a result of dome growth during the emplacement of the laccolith. This suggests that the gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm. may have acted as a local detachment that decoupled the Agrio Fm. from the overlaying Rayoso Fm. and Neuqu\u00e9n Gr., which may have in turn affected the growth of the dome. This interpretation is supported by tectonic studies in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, which have recognized that the detachment potential of the Huitr\u00edn Fm. deeply affected the style of tectonic deformation (e.g., Cobbold and Rossello, 2003). Therefore, our field observations show that ductile deformation can occur at time scales of magma emplacement, as discussed in Section 6.2.\n\n\n6.2\nLaccolith ellipticity and feeder dyke\nThe orientation of the long axis of the reconstructed Pampa Amarilla laccolith is similar to the orientation of most dykes observed in the study area (Figs. 2 and 6) (Barrionuevo et al., 2019), suggesting that the feeder of the laccolith was an E-W-striking dyke. Such a relationship between the long axis of elliptical tabular intrusions and their feeder dykes has been documented for mafic sills (Galerne et al., 2011; Magee et al., 2016). However, we acknowledge that other processes like magma cooling during emplacement (Currier and Marsh, 2015) can also affect the ellipticity of laccoliths.\nThe orientation of a potential E-W-striking feeder dyke is compatible with the regional compressional stresses associated with Andean tectonics. To estimate the time-scale of emplacement of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith, we assume that the laccolith was fed by a L\u00a0=\u00a03-km long (the length of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith) and t\u00a0=\u00a03-m thick dyke, which is a characteristic dyke thickness in the study area (Barrionuevo et al., 2019). Typical values of andesitic magma velocities are v\u00a0=\u00a00.01 to 0.1\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121, thus the volumetric flow rate provided by the feeder dyke would be Q\u00a0=\u00a0L\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0t\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0v between 90 and 900 m3 s\u22121. We estimate the laccolith volume from V\u00a0=\u00a0\u03c0R\n2\nT, where T\u00a0=\u00a0300\u00a0m is an average value for the laccolith thickness, yielding V\u00a0~\u00a02.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0m3. The time scale of emplacement T\u00a0=\u00a0V\/Q thus yields a time-scale between ~1\u00a0year and\u00a0~\u00a01\u00a0month, assuming it formed during one magma pulse. Such results are in good agreement with observations of laccolith emplacement at active volcanoes (Minakami et al., 1951; Castro et al., 2016). Even if this analysis is simplistic, it shows that the ductile deformation observed in the gypsum of the Huitr\u00edn Fm. occurred at time scales orders of magnitude shorter than tectonic deformation time scales.\n\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nMagma emplacement mechanics\nThe trapdoor structure of the Pampa Amarilla dome highlights that the growth of the laccolith is dominantly controlled by faulting and tilting of the overburden. This structure is in good agreement with observations of trapdoor emplacement of laccoliths, such as the Barker Quadrangle laccoliths, Montana (Witkind, 1973; Rom\u00e1n-Berdiel et al., 1995), the Black Mesa laccolith, Henry Mountains, Utah (de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2006), the Eastern Mourne pluton, Northern Ireland (Stevenson et al., 2007), or the Sandfell laccolith, eastern Iceland (Hawkes and Hawkes, 1933; Mattsson et al., 2018). These observations are also in agreement with the models of laccolith and sill emplacement based on the Coulomb failure of the overburden (Rom\u00e1n-Berdiel et al., 1995; Haug et al., 2017; Schmiedel et al., 2017a; Haug et al., 2018; Schmiedel et al., 2019). These models assume that shear failure of the overburden occurs when the intrusion reaches a critical diameter that depends on (1) the depth of the intrusion, (2) the strength and friction angle of the overburden, and (3) the viscosity and volumetric flow rate of the magma. Once the overburden fails, the intrusion can either thicken by pushing the overburden upward along ring faults if the magma is highly viscous, forming a punched laccolith, or propagate along the planes of weakness of the faults if the magma is of low viscosity to form saucer-shaped intrusions (Schmiedel et al., 2019). At the Pampa Amarilla laccolith, we expect the magma to have been highly viscous, favouring a punched laccolith.\nThe geometric characteristics of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith are in disagreement with the end member mechanical model of laccolith emplacement based on elastic bending of the overburden (Murdoch, 2002; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Michaut, 2011; Thorey and Michaut, 2014), which builds on the seminal papers of Johnson and Pollard (1973) and Pollard and Johnson (1973). The main assumptions of these models are the following: (1) the overburden of the intrusion bends elastically as a response of magma overpressure in the intrusion; (2) the basement of the intrusion is rigid. The overburden can be either rigidly attached to the basement (Pollard and Johnson, 1973; Bunger and Cruden, 2011) or attached to the basement through a deformable elastic layer (Kerr and Pollard, 1998; Galland and Scheibert, 2013; Scheibert et al., 2017). In these models, the mathematical formulation of the bending overburden is based on the thin, stiff elastic plate approximation. This model formulation is derived assuming the two following conditions: (1) the thickness of the deforming plate is small with respect to its length, and (2) the deflection of the bending plate is small with respect to the plate thickness (Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger, 1959; Ventsel and Krauthammer, 2002).\nApplied to laccoliths, these conditions translate to: (1) the depth (H) of the intrusion is small with respect to its diameter (D) (H\/D\u00a0<\u00a00.1) and (2) the thickness of the intrusion (T) is small with respect to its depth (T\/H\u00a0<\u00a00.2). The combination of these two conditions implies that the thickness of the intrusion should be much thinner than its diameter (T\/D\u00a0<\u00a00.02). Even though models can technically implement thicker and deeper laccoliths (e.g., Scaillet et al., 1995; Bunger and Cruden, 2011), the resulting deformation in the overburden would not respect the models' assumptions, questioning the physical interpretation of these results.\nThe geometrical characteristics of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith (H\/D\u00a0=\u00a01.3 and T\/D\u00a0=\u00a00.13) do not fulfill the physical assumptions of the laccolith models based on the thin, stiff elastic plate approximation. This mismatch between the models' assumptions and these geometrical characteristics is in good agreement with our observations that the growth of the laccolith is controlled dominantly by faulting of the intrusion's overburden. The data of Fig. 12 (Cruden et al., 2018) show that numerous laccoliths on Earth share similar geometric characteristics as that of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith. For most laccoliths included in Fig. 12, the deformation of their overburden is poorly constrained (Corry, 1988, and references therein). The Pampa Amarilla case study suggests that the growth of thick laccoliths may commonly be controlled by faulting of their overburden.\nThe difference between the end member models based on elastic bending and those based on faulting of the overburden implies distinct scenarios for laccolith growth. The elastic bending model implies that the thickening of the intrusion only happens if the intrusion keeps spreading (Fig. 13\n, left) (Murdoch, 2002; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Galland and Scheibert, 2013; Currier and Marsh, 2015; Kavanagh et al., 2015; Scheibert et al., 2017; Kavanagh et al., 2018), even when cooling effects can temporarily halt the lateral spreading (Currier and Marsh, 2015; Thorey and Michaut, 2016). Conversely, in models based on faulting of the overburden, an initial sill thickens and spreads horizontally until reaching a critical diameter, at which point the overburden fails (Fig. 13, right) (Haug et al., 2017; Schmiedel et al., 2017a; Haug et al., 2018; Schmiedel et al., 2019). Subsequently, the intrusion ceases to spread horizontally, and the magma influx is only accommodated by vertical thickening (Fig. 13, right).\nThe Pampa Amarilla laccolith was emplaced near the bottom of the Vaca Muerta Fm., which is an organic-rich shale formation. Several studies show that the emplacement of igneous intrusions into shale formations in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin (Vaca Muerta F., Agrio Fm.) is accommodated by shear failure and ductile flow of the host shale (Spacapan et al., 2017; Galland et al., 2019; Magee et al., 2019). These studies show that the tips of sheet-shaped sills propagate by pushing the host rock like an indenter, in disagreement with the main models of sill emplacement based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (Pollard, 1973; Rubin, 1993). Such a mechanism dominated by inelastic deformation was likely at work during the early phase of emplacement of a sill before the overburden failed and the laccolith thickened. As demonstrated by Rom\u00e1n-Berdiel et al. (1995), the emplacement of magma in weak, ductile host formations can greatly control the development of laccoliths.\nNote that our study only investigates the structure of the dome induced by the Pampa Amarilla laccolith, which is not exposed. We therefore cannot investigate whether the Pampa Amarilla laccolith formed as a result of emplacement of a single magma pulse or several, successive magma injections, as documented at several laccoliths (de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2006; Leuthold et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2016; Morgan, 2018; Ruggles et al., 2021). The borehole data from well PA.x-2 shows that above the main andesitic body, a few thin sills were crossed by the well. This suggests that the Pampa Amarilla laccolith might have been emplaced as a result of several successive injections of magma. The number, duration, timing, and volume of each magma pulse cannot be determined.\n\n\n7.2\nInternal deformation of the dome\nEven though the main faulting occurs along the western peripheral fault of the Pampa Amarilla dome, structural mapping shows that minor faulting also affects the central part of the dome (Figs. 6 and 7). Most evident is an E-W striking normal fault that is subparallel to the long axis of the dome. The distribution of such minor faults is consistent with crestal graben structures occurring above thick shallow intrusions (van Wyk de Vries et al., 2014, and references therein). Similar minor structures associated with magma-induced doming are systematically observed in laboratory models of dome resurgence (Acocella et al., 2001; Acocella and Mulugeta, 2002), laccolith emplacement (Rom\u00e1n-Berdiel et al., 1995; Schmiedel et al., 2017a; Schmiedel et al., 2019) and even sill emplacement (Galland, 2012; Schmiedel et al., 2017a). These structures show that outer-arc stretching due to bending occurred in the central parts of the dome, even though the uplift was accommodated by the western boundary fault.\nThese minor faults show that the structure of the Pampa Amarilla dome is not simple. However, characterization of the detailed structure of the dome would require much better exposure conditions in the central part of the dome, which is hidden by Quaternary deposits. An indirect method for reconstructing the structure of the dome would be through balanced cross sections. However, the main methods for restoring balanced cross sections have been applied to tectonic structures such as rifts and fold-and-thrust belts (Giambiagi et al., 2012; Mescua and Giambiagi, 2012; Lopez-Mir, 2019), where (1) the structures are triggered by horizontal tectonic movements and (2) the structures are dominantly cylindrical and so 2-dimensional profiles perpendicular to the strike of the structures are good approximations. A dome induced by a laccolith is very different: the structure is accommodated by vertical movements of crustal blocks, and the dome is concentric, such that the third dimension becomes an issue for the reconstruction and cylindrical deformation, i.e. perpendicular to the radial profiles, is likely to occur.\n\n\n7.3\nIntegrated surface and subsurface data\nDetermining the structure of the Pampa Amarilla laccolith and dome would have not been possible using the subsurface data or the surface geological mapping alone. For example, even if a structure is noticeable on the seismic data, the seismic signal is incoherent (Fig. 4), so that neither the dome nor the intrusion are imaged. In general, our study highlights the need for caution when interpreting seismic data of igneous intrusions (Schofield et al., 2015; Rabbel et al., 2018), even if high-quality data locally reveals complex structures (Bischoff et al., 2020; Reynolds et al., 2021). On the other hand, even though surface geological mapping at Pampa Amarilla indicates the extent of the dome and its trapdoor characteristics, it was necessary to integrate these observations with borehole and seismic data to quantify the amplitude of the dome, and so the thickness of the underlying intrusion. Our study highlights the added value of integrating geological and geophysical data for reconstruction of large igneous intrusions and their associated structures.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nWe have described a detailed 3-dimensional structural reconstruction of the Pampa Amarilla dome and the associated subsurface Pampa Amarilla laccolithic intrusion. Our study integrates surface geological observations with subsurface 3D seismic and well data. The conclusions of our study are:\n\n\u2022\nThe Pampa Amarilla dome formed due to the emplacement of a thick subsurface laccolithic intrusion.\n\n\n\u2022\nStructural cross sections across the dome were used to estimate that the maximum amplitude of the dome and maximum thickness of the laccolith is ~400\u00a0m.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe dome exhibits a trapdoor structure, with faulting along the western, northwestern and southwestern edges, and gentle tilting of the overburden to the east. The trapdoor tilting of the laccolith's overburden was the main mechanism that controlled the thickening of the laccolith.\n\n\n\u2022\nMinor faulting in the centre of the dome is attributed to 3D stretching of the overburden.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe reconstructed subsurface Pampa Amarilla laccolith is elliptical in map view, with a 3\u00a0km-long E-W axis and a 2\u00a0km-long N-S axis. Along E-W cross section, the laccolith is wedge shaped with maximum thickness near its western edge, and exhibits gradual thinning toward the east.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe emplacement of the relatively thick Pampa Amarilla laccolith, with a thickness-to-length ratio T\/D\u00a0~\u00a00.13, was mostly accommodated by faulting of the overburden units.\n\n\n\u2022\nGiven that numerous laccolithic intrusions exhibit similar values of T\/D, our study suggests that the established mechanical models of laccolith emplacement based on elastic bending of the overburden applies only to few, thin laccoliths\/thick sills.\n\n\n\nFinally, our study highlights the necessity and value of integrating field geological measurements with subsurface 3D seismic and borehole data for structural reconstructions of subsurface laccolith intrusions.\n\n\nCredit author statement\n\nOlivier Galland: Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, writing - original draft.

Paleostress determinations on brittle structures suggest that at least three stress regimes have affected the Eastern Cordillera since the Late Cretaceous (e.g., Cort\u00e9s et al., 2005).\nThe Eastern Cordillera is an inverted rift system (Colletta et al., 1990; Dengo and Covey, 1993; Cooper et al., 1995; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2005; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006; Bayona et al., 2008; Mora et al., 2008, 2010, 2013, 2015). Faults that have experienced tectonic inversion are localized along both flanks of the Eastern Cordillera; the Guaicaramo Fault system on the eastern flank and the La Salina Fault system on the western flank (e.g., Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2013). In the northern Eastern Cordillera, faults that have experienced inversion (dip slip displacement >\u00a0>\u00a0strike slip) include the Boyac\u00e1, Soapaga, and Su\u00e1rez faults (Cooper et al., 1995; Hermeston and Nem\u010dok, 2013; Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Mora et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013) (Fig. 1). These structures control the regional trend of the Eastern Cordillera, and in Mesozoic time controlled the deposition of graben-filling sedimentary sequences, some reaching a thickness of about five km (Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Bayona et al., 2020b).\nStrike-slip displacements are also linked to the evolution of the Eastern Cordillera, including the formation of the Magdalena Valley Basin by the right-lateral Ibague fault (Acosta et al., 2004; Montes et al., 2005; Kammer, 1999; Velandia et al., 2005; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Displacement along the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault controlled vertical uplift of the Santander Massif since the Eocene (Velandia, 2017; Velandia et al., 2020; Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Siravo et al., 2019; Amaya-Ferreira et al., 2020) with slip-rates in the Neogene estimated to be ~3\u00a0mm\/yr (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015). According to Velandia (2017) and Velandia et al. (2020), normal faults in the Santander Massif experienced a positive inversion during the Neogene as a transpressive regime propagated into the Santander Massif in response to transpressional displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1). The metamorphic and igneous rock-cored Santander Massif is a tectonic element that exposes several structural transitions with surrounding areas: to the north with the Perij\u00e1 Range and Cesar Basin, to the east with the M\u00e9rida Andes and Catatumbo Basin, to the south with the Floresta Massif and the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera, and to the west with the western foothills of the Eastern Cordillera and the northernmost segment of the Middle Magdalena Basin.\nPrevious studies had not reported whether vertical-axis rotations occurred at the boundary of the inverted northern Eastern Cordillera and wrench-dominated Santander Massif structures, and had not considered the possible implications of these rotations for the structural evolution of this complex area. Therefore, our work concentrates on the history of the inversion to a wrench-dominated deformation pattern that is documented between the Santander Massif and the axial and western structural domains of the northern Eastern Cordillera. In order to better understand how the complex structural transitional zone evolved from the Mesozoic to today, we investigate the changes in magnetic fabrics using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and the distribution, sense, and magnitude of vertical axis rotations, inferred from paleomagnetic data, as a function of crustal shortening versus strike-slip deformation.\nPaleomagnetic and AMS techniques are used on rocks from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous sedimentary\/volcaniclastic sequences distributed in three major study areas covering the change in structural styles from inverted to wrench-type structures (Fig. 1). These techniques supply data about magnetic fabrics, magnitudes and senses of block rotations and latitudinal translations, as other regional studies had reported in the Eastern Cordillera, Perij\u00e1 Range, and M\u00e9rida Andes (Castillo et al., 1991; Gose et al., 2003; Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Nova et al., 2012, 2019; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014; Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez, 2016). The selected study areas include the following six localities: the NNE-trending Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) in the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera; the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) in the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera; areas adjacent to the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault zone, which from south to north are: Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif (localities 3 to 5), and Aguachica (locality 6) located farther to the north at the right relay of the left-lateral Bucaramanga fault in the northern Santander Massif (Fig. 1). The first two areas in the northern Eastern Cordillera include regional reverse faults that are the product of basin inversion (Kammer and Sanchez, 2006; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013). The other four areas are adjacent to regional wrench-dominated Bucaramanga Fault and associated structures.\nThe AMS examines strain in a wide range of rock types that have experienced differing degrees of deformation (Borradaile and Tarling, 1981; Hrouda, 1982; Borradaile, 1988, 2001; Rochette et al., 1992; Par\u00e9s and Dinar\u00e8s, 1993; Borradaile and Henry, 1997; Borradaile and Jackson, 2004). In orogens that have experienced tectonic inversion (e.g., Eastern Cordillera), a pre-inversion magnetic fabric may be preserved (e.g., Soto et al., 2007), or a new, post-inversion magnetic fabric formed (e.g., Oliva-Urcia et al., 2010). The magnitude and sense of vertical-axis rotations of crustal blocks can often be linked to strike-slip displacement (Ron et al., 1984; Sonder et al., 1994; Piper et al., 1997; Sussman et al., 2004; Randall et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2004, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014). Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al. (2014) demonstrated that the distribution and magnitude of crustal block rotations are useful to explain strike-slip fault systems in the context of regional kinematic models. Inclination data, if properly corrected for any compaction-related shallowing, allow the estimation of the paleolatitude location of study areas at the time of remanence acquisition.\n\n\n2\nGeologic setting, jurassic stratigraphy and previous paleomagnetic studies\n\n2.1\nRegional tectonic evolution of the northern Andes\nThe northern Andes is composed, in the south, of the Western, Central, and Eastern cordilleras, and the Eastern Cordillera changes northward into the Santander Massif, M\u00e9rida Andes, and Perij\u00e1 Range (Fig. 1). The Western and Central Cordilleras are separated by the intermontane Cauca-Pat\u00eda Basin, and the Central and Eastern cordilleras are separated by the intermontane Magdalena Valley Basin (Fig. 1). The Santander Massif is surrounded by the northern Middle Magdalena Valley to the west and the Catatumbo Basin and the southwestern termination of the M\u00e9rida Andes to the east (Fig. 1).\nContinuous subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the northwest part of the South American Plate has been ongoing since the late Paleozoic (Case et al., 1990; Restrepo-Pace, 1995; Cediel et al., 2003). Early to Middle Jurassic extensional tectonism was related to the separation of the North and South America Plates, the rotation of the Yucat\u00e1n Block, and seafloor spreading in the proto\u2013Caribbean Ocean. During this period, transtensional basins were filled with marine sediments, followed by the deposition of km-thick volcaniclastic deposits (represented by the Bocas, Jord\u00e1n, and Nore\u00e1n formations) (Bayona et al., 2020b) (Fig. 2\n). After the cessation of volcanism and a period of deformation, another extensional regime operated during the Late Jurassic, affecting the internal part of the Santander Massif, Arcabuco and Los Yarigu\u00edes extensional basins, presently in the northern Eastern Cordillera. These Late Jurassic extensional basins are characterized by a record of the km-thick continental terrigenous deposits (Gir\u00f3n Group), and these deposits overlie in angular unconformity Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic rocks (Bayona et al., 2020b).\nA different extensional basin configuration developed during the Early Cretaceous, with two broad half-graben basins located to the east of the present Central Cordillera: the Tablazo-Magdalena sub-basin to the west and the Cocuy sub-basin to the east. These basins were separated by a horst structure, the Floresta-Santander high (Fabre, 1987; Cooper et al., 1995; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006) (Fig. 2). Syn-rift Lower Cretaceous sedimentary successions in these two half-graben basins consist of marine to transitional sequences. Albian to Turonian age marginal to marine sedimentary rocks covered uniformly these two basins and the Floresta-Santander high, following a post-rift stage of tectonic subsidence regime (Cooper et al., 1995; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006).\nAccretion of oceanic volcanic rocks and the subduction of the Caribbean plate caused the uplift of the Central Cordillera-Santa Marta Massif blocks since late Campanian time (Gomez et al., 2003; Bayona et al., 2013; Montes et al., 2019). To the east, the reactivation of Cretaceous age extensional structures as inverted, reverse fault structures since latest Cretaceous time was the dominant mechanism that formed syn-orogenic basins that were filled with continental deposits (Montes et al., 2003; Cort\u00e9s et al., 2006; Bayona et al., 2013; Reyes-Harker et al., 2015). Structural blocks within the Arcabuco and Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinoria, the Santander Massif and paleo-Central Cordillera supplied sediments to adjacent basins (Parra et al., 2012; Caballero et al., 2013; Bayona et al., 2020a). During the early Oligocene, inversion of pre-existing normal faults resulted in the exhumation of regional blocks along several structures in both flanks of the Eastern Cordillera (Colletta et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2006, 2008, 2010), the Santander Massif (Ross et al., 2009; Velandia, 2017; Siravo et al., 2018, 2019) and M\u00e9rida Andes (Berm\u00fadez et al., 2010). Continuous subduction of the Caribe (north of Panama arc) and later Nazca plate (south of Panama arc) to the west since the Oligocene and the collision of the Panam\u00e1 arc with northwest South America during the middle to late Miocene are interpreted as the mechanisms that drove shortening deformation in the Eastern Cordillera (Duque-Caro, 1990; Taboada et al., 2000; Montes et al., 2019).\n\n\n2.2\nStructural styles of selected study areas\nThe northern segment of the Eastern Cordillera is strongly asymmetric, with a gentle and wide western flank, a wide axial zone with exposure of basement rocks in the Floresta Massif region, and a steep and short eastern flank (Mora et al., 2006; Siravo et al., 2018, 2019). Neogene deformation in this segment is related to inverted and other compressional structures presently located toward the eastern and western foothills (Colletta et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1995; Mora et al., 2006, 2009; Horton et al., 2010; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014), the Eastern Cordillera has not experienced appreciable vertical axis rotation (less than 20 degrees), and oblique, transpressional shortening was partitioned into pure dip-slip shear in both frontal thrust sheets and right-lateral strike-slip displacement in the axial part of the Eastern Cordillera (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Recent GPS studies document the NE-directed tectonic transport of several blocks of the northern Andes (Mora-P\u00e1ez et al., 2019, 2020), and this component of deformation is not considered in the shortening estimates based on orthogonal cross-sections.\nFor structures in the Santander Massif, left lateral displacements are related to deformation along the active Bucaramanga Fault (Paris et al., 2000; Diederix et al., 2009; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015; Siravo et al., 2018; Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Velandia et al., 2020) with displacements >45\u00a0km (Toro, 1990). These NE-SW striking transverse faults with right-lateral displacement are linked to the Bucaramanga Fault, defining a regional domino-style block geometry (Velandia, 2017) (Fig. 1). Based on field data, Cu\u00e9llar et al. (2012) proposed that NE-SW oriented right-lateral faults displace the northern segment of the Bucaramanga Fault. The right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault to the Guamalito Fault (Velandia et al., 2020) in the Aguachica locality marks the transition to the Perij\u00e1 Range to the north. The rapid phase of exhumation and vertical uplift of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif began in the last 10\u00a0Ma and was caused by the transition from regular to flat-slab subduction (Siravo et al., 2019). Neogene exhumation events are identified in the Santander Massif (Amaya et al., 2017; van der Lelij et al., 2016; Siravo et al., 2019; Amaya-Ferreira et al., 2020), and they are interpreted as a vertical component of displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n2.3\nJurassic stratigraphy in the Northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, and tectonic models for the Jurassic\nJurassic sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks in the northern Eastern Cordillera are exposed in three areas, all of which show an eastward decrease in thickness and important variations in lithologic associations (see summary and references in Velandia and Berm\u00fadez, 2018; Bayona et al., 2020b and Osorio-Afanador and Velandia, 2021).\nIn the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera, exposures of Jurassic rocks are at the Arcabuco anticlinorium and the Floresta Massif. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, continental sandstones and mudstones of the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Palermo and Montebel formations unconformably overlie metamorphosed mid-Paleozoic rocks. Middle Jurassic continental volcaniclastic rocks of the La Rusia Formation overlie the Lower Jurassic succession. The Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous succession corresponds to fluvial-marginal sediments of Arcabuco Formation (Fig. 2); the full thickness of Jurassic rocks in the Arcabuco anticlinorium is <3kms. In the Floresta Massif, the thin (<1\u00a0km) continental fluvial deposits of the Upper Jurassic unconformably overlie metamorphosed mid-Paleozoic rocks. To the south of the Floresta Massif, the Lower Cretaceous rocks rest unconformably upon Paleozoic rocks.\nThe Jurassic succession to the east and west of the Bucaramanga Fault varies mainly in thickness and the types of rocks below the unconformity. In the Mesas-Bucaramanga localities, to the west of the Bucaramanga Fault, volcaniclastic red beds of the Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation overlie unconformably the Upper Triassic Bocas Formation and Paleozoic rocks (Osorio-Afanador and Velandia, 2021). The Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group rests in angular unconformity (<15\u00b0) upon the Jord\u00e1n Formation. The westernmost area corresponds to the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium at the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera, where the Upper Jurassic-lowermost Cretaceous fluvial Gir\u00f3n Group has a thickness variable (hundreds of m to ~4\u00a0km) and changes across transversal faults. In the Santander Massif, to the east of Bucaramanga Fault, Jurassic strata are restricted to small and segmented basins with thickness\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0km, identified units correspond to Bocas, Jord\u00e1n and Gir\u00f3n, and Jurassic strata that overlie metamorphic-igneous basement rocks (Fig. 2). Farther to the north, in a right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault to the Guamalito Fault, Lower Jurassic volcaniclastic rocks of the Nore\u00e1n Formation rest unconformably upon mid-Paleozoic metamorphic rocks, and they may reach up to 3\u00a0km in thickness (Velandia, 2017).\nFather to the west in the subsurface of the Magdalena Valley, Sarmiento (2011) compiled information from several industry studies that clearly illustrates deformation of pre-middle Eocene age forming several paleohighs with an average NE-SW orientation that more likely correspond to the reactivation of former Mesozoic structures. On its southern and eastern segments are reported fluvial deposits of the Upper Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group, whereas on its northern and western segment, the Jurassic sequence consists of the volcano-clastic deposits of the Lower Jurassic Nore\u00e1n Formation (Bayona et al., 2020).\nThree tectonic models for the Triassic \u2013 Jurassic evolution of the NW corner of Gondwana have been proposed (see review in Bayona et al., 2020b). The first model involves a set of Jurassic intracontinental rifts as a result of extensional tectonism (Mojica and Kammer, 1995; Cediel et al., 2003). A second model considers this area to have been a continental margin with adjacent magmatic arcs that resulted from subduction\u2013zone migration (e. g., Cochrane et al., 2014; Spikings et al., 2015, Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2018). A third model also considers subduction to the west, but the angle of convergence between the ancient Pacific lithosphere and western Gondwana lithosphere fragments changed during the Jurassic, controlling the formation and location of magmatic arcs, the decrease of magmatic activity in the middle Jurassic, and the translations of para\u2013autochthonous terranes during the Late Jurassic (Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Toussaint, 1995).\n\n\n2.4\nPrevious paleomagnetic investigations in the Eastern Cordillera, Santander Massif, Perij\u00e1 Range and Guajira blocks\nEarly paleomagnetic studies in northwest South America focused on Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks exposed in the Bucaramanga area (Creer et al., 1970), the Santander Massif (Hargraves et al., 1984), and the Perij\u00e1 Range (Maze and Hargraves, 1984) (Fig. 1). More recent paleomagnetic studies have uncovered characteristic remanent magnetization components in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks that have permitted the documentation of paleolatitudinal translations and vertical-axis rotations. According to Castillo et al. (1991), the Middle Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous strata in the M\u00e9rida Andes reveal no significant palaeolatitudinal translations. Paleomagnetic results from Lower Jurassic rocks exposed in the Mesas- Bucaramanga localities (Jord\u00e1n Formation; Bayona et al., 2006) and the Santa Marta Massif (in volcanic units; Bayona et al., 2010) suggest that these blocks were translated from the southern hemisphere (~10\u00b0S) to near-equatorial latitudes. According to Bayona et al. (2006), the Upper Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous strata in the Mesas-Bucaramanga area and Floresta Massif were always located at shallow northern hemisphere latitudes. Although paleomagnetic results from these studies suggest latitudinal discordancy based on a comparison of observed inclination data with respect to expected directions based on reference paleomagnetic data for South America, these results did not consider inclination shallowing due to sediment compaction and related diagenetic processes.\nIn the Perij\u00e1 Range, Gose et al. (2003) and Nova et al. (2012) reported paleomagnetic results from Jurassic (La Quinta Formation) and Cretaceous (Rionegro Formation) strata. These studies proposed post-Eocene ~40 to 50\u00b0 CW rotation of this general area (Fig. 1), with no paleolatitudinal translations. To the north of the Oca Fault (Fig. 1), Nova et al. (2019) reported paleomagnetic results from Jurassic rocks in the Guajira block, where 70-90o clockwise rotations have been proposed for this block. However, large uncertainties in the reported paleomagnetic data preclude a clear estimation of paleolatitudinal translation; the authors propose a tectonic evolution of the Guajira block with the conjugate Mexican margin to the north.\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported magnetostratigraphic data from the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and inferred an age of deposition between early Kimmeridgian and Valanginian (~157 to 139\u00a0Ma). Using an f factor of 0.6 to correct the inclination data of the Gir\u00f3n Group strata, Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) proposed that the crustal elements were located in the northern hemisphere at a latitude of ~7\u00b0. Since the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time, the magnitude of latitudinal translation decreased, and only minor northward translations occurred. According to Bayona et al. (2006), in the Mesa area, local counterclockwise (CCW) rotations of some 90\u00b0 of fault-bounded blocks occurred before the syn-extensional deposition of Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sequences. According to Bayona et al. (2006) farther north of Bucaramanga, the rotations are less significant.\nAccording to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014) the Miocene deformation event in the Eastern Cordillera was not associated with appreciable vertical axis rotation, and oblique transpressional shortening was partitioned into pure dip-slip shear in both frontal thrust sheets and right-lateral strike-slip faults, in the axial part of the Eastern Cordillera. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) report data consistent with CW rotations of 45\u00b0 in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, related to Neogene strike-slip displacement along both regional and local faults (Fig. 1). Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez (2016) report paleomagnetic results from Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones and Paleogene continental sandstones in the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera and suggest moderate CW rotations up to 20o and CCW rotations of 28o in response to strike-slip displacement along transverse faults. The noncoaxial strain resulted in the development of steep magnetic fabric lineations in Cretaceous to Miocene sedimentary rocks, and these lineations are oblique to the regional trend of the Eastern Cordillera (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). This relationship could imply that reactivation of master normal faults within the Eastern Cordillera occurred under simple or sub-simple shear. Other AMS data from Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene sedimentary rocks in the Zipaquir\u00e1 Anticline located in the axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera show either magnetic lineations that are parallel to the structural grain of the Eastern Cordillera or the preservation of sedimentary magnetic fabrics in the back limb of the Zipaquir\u00e1 Anticline (Garc\u00eda and Jim\u00e9nez, 2016).\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2015) reported magnetostratigraphic data from the Quaternary Bucaramanga alluvial fan deposits and demonstrated that these were deposited across the ca. 778\u00a0ka Matuyama to Brunhes, chron transition and they used this information to estimate a\u00a0~\u00a03\u00a0mm\/yr slip rate for the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n\n3\nMethods\n\n3.1\nFieldwork\nWe carried out a sampling campaign on hematitic mudstones and silty fine sandstones of the Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif (Figs. 1 and 2). We sampled a total of 47 sites (~550 samples cores) distributed at six localities: (locality 1) eleven sites at both flanks of the Arcabuco anticlinorium (sites AR, AM, AP, prefixes) (supplementary material 1), (locality 2) seven sites at the eastern flank of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (sites ZG and ZLS) (supplementary material 2), (locality 3) eleven sites at Mesas locality (sites SJ and PJ) (supplementary material 2), (locality 4) six sites at the Bucaramanga locality (sites B and G) (supplementary material 2), (locality 5) seven sites at the southern Santander Massif to the east of Bucaramanga fault (sites MJ, JD, and S) (supplementary material 2), and (locality 6) five sites on the right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault farther north in Aguachica, northern Santander Massif (sites N1 to N5) (supplementary material 3). At each site, we collected 10\u201314 cores (12 on average), spaced at least two exposures and multiple beds to try to average out the paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field.\nSamples as drilled cores were obtained by using a portable gas-powered drill cooled by water and oriented in situ with a corrected magnetic compass (between \u22126 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a08\u00b0 according to the World Magnetic Model and calculated using the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center web page; http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/geomag-web\/). After field sampling, cores were cut into standard specimens of ~2.2\u00a0cm in length and 2.5\u00a0cm in diameter using a non-magnetic bronze saw.\n\n\n3.2\nMagnetic mineralogy experiments\nRock magnetic experiments were conducted to identify the main magnetization carriers. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition and backfield demagnetization, thermal demagnetization of three-component isothermal remanent magnetization (TM-IRM) (Lowrie, 1990), and thermomagnetic (bulk susceptibility versus temperature) curves were obtained. For the IRM acquisition experiments, representative specimens were subjected to at least 25 sequential steps from 10 to 2800 mT, and for backfield demagnetization, at least 12 sequence steps from 10 to 700 mT. DC fields were applied using an IM-10-30 pulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific). Coercivity spectra from IRM acquisition curves were evaluated using the MaxUnmix software (Maxbauer et al., 2016). For TM-IRM, the representative specimens were magnetized in an IM-10-30 impulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific), and three fields were applied to the z, y, and x, axes (2.7, 0.6, and 0.12\u00a0T, respectively). Thermal demagnetization was carried out with a TD 48 (ASC Scientific) thermal unit in 17 steps between 100\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0\u00b0C. In both IRM and TM-IRM experiments, after each step, the remanence was measured with a JR6-A Dual Speed Spinner Magnetometer (AGICO Inc.). Thermomagnetic curves were measured on powders from representative specimens using a CS4 furnace coupled with a MFK1- Kappabridge (AGICO Inc.), in an inert atmosphere. Seven polished thin sections of representative samples were studied using an Olympus BX51 microscope, equipped with a DP72 camera, in both transmitted and reflected light mode.\n\n\n3.3\nAnisotropy of magnetic susceptibility\nThe low-field AMS of specimens of appropriate size\/shape from each sample core was measured in a Kappabridge instrument (MFK1-FA, AGICO), using a three-position automated array. The AMS tensor is represented by an ellipsoid with three principal axes that correspond to the maximum, intermediate, and minimum susceptibilities (K1, K2, and K3 or K\n\nmax\n, K\n\nint\n, and K\n\nmin\n, respectively). The AMS ellipsoid is characterized by a magnetic lineation (L, grouped K\n\nmax\n axes) and a magnetic foliation (F, plane normal to K\n\nmin\n axes). The corrected degree of anisotropy (P\u2032) offers information about magnetic minerals and their degree of preferred orientation, and the shape parameter (T) ranges from \u22121 to 1, for oblate ellipsoids or planar fabrics (T\u00a0>\u00a00) and for prolate ellipsoids or elongated fabrics (T\u00a0<\u00a00). The mean scalar parameters for each site were evaluated according to Jelinek's statistics (Jelinek, 1977, 1978) using the Anisoft 5.1 software (AGICO Inc.).\n\n\n3.4\nPaleomagnetic data\nWe conducted measurements of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and the subsequent progressive demagnetization using a cryogenic magnetometer (2G Enterprises, USA) with a magnetic intensity sensitivity of ~1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (A\/m) and a JR6-A Dual Speed Spinner Magnetometer (AGICO Inc.). Thermal demagnetization was successfully used on most samples to yield full demagnetization trajectories, with almost no formation of new magnetic phases or spurious behavior during heating, based on progressive thermal demagnetization that typically involved 17 heating steps from 100\u00a0\u00b0C to 700\u00a0\u00b0C with a TD 48 (ASC Scientific) thermal unit until the maximum unblocking temperature of hematite. Thermal demagnetization data were plotted on orthogonal vector diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), and the magnetization components were isolated by principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980). The mean directions were evaluated by Fisher's (1953) statistics, using Remasoft 3.0 (AGICO Inc.) software. All remanence measurements were done in a shielded room in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas (USA).\nThe statistical reversal test classification is based on individual samples for different localities directions using classify on poles and classifies on directions (Koymans et al., 2016; McFadden and McElhinny, 1990). The reversal test is indeterminate following the criteria of Koymans et al. (2016) and the fold test was applied using individual samples for different localities (Koymans et al., 2016; Tauxe and Watson, 1994). We applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method (Tauxe et al., 2008) to evaluate the possibility of the need for correcting our obtained directional data set for inclination shallowing. According to Tauxe and Kent (2004), the data set used should be large enough to provide sufficient recording of paleosecular variation. The rotation and flattening (relation between the observed and expected inclinations) estimates were calculated for each site according to Demarest (1983), using corrected inclinations and the age-appropriate reference South America paleopoles reported by (Torsvik et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\n\n4.1\nField observations related to the sample collection\n\n4.1.1\nLocality 1\nIn the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera, the Arcabuco anticlinorium is a symmetric fold that plunges to the south, associated with the east-verging Boyac\u00e1 Fault, and follows the regional trend of the northern axial zone of the Eastern Cordillera (Fig. 1). Upper Triassic to Upper Jurassic rocks form the core of the Arcabuco anticlinorium, while Cretaceous strata form symmetric synclines in the fore and back limbs, Los Medios and Guacamayas synclines, respectively (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 1). The footwall of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault is affected by east-verging reverse faults, interpreted as strands of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault. Locally, west-verging reverse and E-W strike-slip faults deform the Arcabuco anticlinorium. Adjacent to the Arcabuco anticlinorium to the east is located the Floresta Massif and corresponds to the hanging wall of the Soapaga Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 1). Sites were established in the core and both limbs of the Arcabuco anticlinorium, including Palermo (1 site, AP), Montebel (5 sites, AM), and La Rusia (5 sites, AR) formations, allowing for a fold test to be performed and to document variations of paleomagnetic directions in different stratigraphic units (supplementary material 1).\n\n\n4.1.2\nLocality 2\nIn the western flank of the northern Eastern Cordillera, the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium is an asymmetric fold trending ~N10E, bounded to the north by the Bucaramanga Fault and plunging to the south (Fig. 1). Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group strata form the core of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, while east-verging reverse faults (El Ramo, Zapatoca, and Su\u00e1rez faults) deform the forelimb (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). The Zapatoca Syncline, in the hanging wall of the Su\u00e1rez Fault, involves Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata and plunges to the north and south. The back limb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium is deformed by west-verging reverse faults, affecting the Lower Cretaceous units. The substantial thickness variation of Gir\u00f3n Group strata, from >4\u00a0km in the hanging wall to <100\u00a0m in the footwall, points out the effect of tectonic inversion of the Su\u00e1rez Fault (supplementary material 2). Seven sites are located in the hanging wall of the Suarez Fault and the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium distributed in the >2\u00a0km-thick siliciclastic strata of the Gir\u00f3n Group (supplementary material 2; sites ZG and ZLS).\n\n\n4.1.3\nLocality 3\nIn the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault, west of southern Santander Massif, the Mesas locality corresponds to the footwall of the Su\u00e1rez reverse fault. This area is characterized by structural flat-blocks of Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation and Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Gir\u00f3n Group strata affected by displacement along normal faults and also right-lateral displacement along the NNE-striking El Monje Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). This area is characterized by angular unconformities between metamorphic rocks of mid-Paleozoic age and Lower Jurassic strata and a slight angular unconformity (< 15\u00b0) between the Jord\u00e1n and Gir\u00f3n sequences (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). The thickness variations or absence of the upper Paleozoic to Jurassic rocks along the SN and W-E direction suggest that sedimentation was controlled by Jurassic normal faulting. Nine sites were collected in the volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Jord\u00e1n Formation, located in the footwall of the Suarez and Bucaramanga faults and south of El Monje Fault (supplementary material 2, sites SJ). Two additional sites were collected in the Jord\u00e1n Formation, and they are located farther north (PJ) and south (AJ) of the other nine sites to compare the directions in the same unit at different stratigraphic and structural locations.\n\n\n4.1.4\nLocality 4\nWest of southern Santander Massif, all sites of the Bucaramanga locality were collected in the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). In this area, upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks unconformably underlie the Lower Jurassic Jord\u00e1n Formation. Sites are distributed in the Jord\u00e1n Formation (4 sites) and Gir\u00f3n Group (2 sites) located in the footwall of Bucaramanga Fault (supplementary material 2, sites B and G).\n\n\n4.1.5\nLocality 5\nEast of the Bucaramanga Fault, in the southern Santander Massif area is located in the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault, where Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous strata rest unconformably upon basement rocks of the Santander Massif (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2). In several blocks within the Santander Massif, a thin and flat Gir\u00f3n Group overlies mid-Paleozoic metamorphic rocks (Fig. 1). In the footwall of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic strata are thick (> 3\u00a0km) (sites MJ3 and JD), while the Gir\u00f3n Group is represented by a thin stratigraphic section (< 100\u00a0m). In the hanging wall of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, the Triassic-Jurassic strata, in general, are absent or locally represented by a thin stratigraphic section (< 100\u00a0m) (Fig. 1 and supplementary material 2, sites MJ2 and GR). Despite the structural complexity in this locality, the area has flat-lying strata in structural domains with a thin (<100\u00a0m) and undifferentiated Gir\u00f3n Group (supplementary material 2). The Surat\u00e1 Fault controlled the deposition of Triassic and Jurassic units and is interpreted as an inverted fault (Julivert, 1958). In this locality, sampled sites are distributed in the Jord\u00e1n Formation (3 sites) and Gir\u00f3n Group (4 sites) (supplementary material 2).\n\n\n4.1.6\nLocality 6\nThis locality, named Aguachica, is at the right splay of the Bucaramanga Fault involving basement rocks of the northern Santander Massif. In this area, the >3\u00a0km thick Lower Jurassic Nore\u00e1n Formation overlies the crystalline basement of the Santander Massif. Five sites were collected in the Nore\u00e1n Formation, a unit that is tilted and deformed by the right relay of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 1) (supplementary material 3, sites N).\n\n\n\n4.2\nMagnetic mineralogy\nIn representative samples analyzed from all six localities, the thermomagnetic experiments (susceptibility versus temperature, all in argon environment) reveal some changes to the magnetic mineralogy over elevated temperature intervals (Fig. 3\n). In some samples, heating and cooling curves are partially reversible, suggesting minor changes during the heating process, and the curves provide Curie temperature estimates of ~580\u00a0\u00b0C and\u00a0~\u00a0680\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3). All samples show a substantial increase in susceptibility in cooling to room temperature. The heating curves show a principal decay between ~580\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of magnetite\/maghemite (Fig. 3A, B, D, G, and F). Sample N4 (Fig. 3I Aguachica, locality 6) shows an increase between ~150\u00a0\u00b0C and 350\u00a0\u00b0C on the heating curves, suggesting the neoproduction of maghemite through the transformation of less magnetic Fe-hydroxides during initial heating (Florindo et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2005; Duan et al., 2014). The cooling curves observed in representative samples of all the areas show a susceptibility increase between 700\u00a0\u00b0C and 600\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3D, E, F, G, and H,), and between 590\u00a0\u00b0C and 570\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 3A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I), suggesting hematite and magnetite, respectively. Sample AM19 (Fig. 3B Arcabuco, locality 1) is unique in that it shows a cooling peak of ~400\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the production of maghemite.\nSusceptibility is divided into the paramagnetic (kp) and ferrimagnetic (s.l) (kf) components (Hrouda et al., 1997). In the first part of the curves (0\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 200\u00a0\u00b0C) (Fig. 3), the hyperbolic shape observed in samples of all the areas suggests that paramagnetic fraction is the main contributor to the magnetic susceptibility, while a linear trend and a positive slope are indicative for ferromagnetic phases (Hrouda et al., 1997).\nThe IRM acquisition and backfield demagnetization experiments (Fig. 4\n), carried out on representative samples from Arcabuco anticlinorium, Mesas, Santander Massif, and Aguachica localities, mainly show that the acquisition curves have a moderate positive slope over fields below ~300 mT. Saturation is not reached at 2500 mT, suggesting the presence of the high coercivity fraction phases hematite and goethite (Fig. 4). Backfield demagnetization of near-saturation IRM yields approximate coercivity of remanence values ranging from 450 to 700 mT. IRM unmix models reveal different coercivity components from the IRM acquisition curves (Fig. 4). Components 1 and 2 with Bh\u00a0>\u00a02.65 log units (> 447 mT) are consistent with hematite and goethite. Component 3 has a mean coercivity range from 1.50\u20132.30 log units (32\u2013199 mT) and is interpreted as a detrital soft magnetite grain population (Egli, 2004).\nThe thermal demagnetization of three-component IRM results (Lowrie, 1990) carried out on representative samples from all six areas shows that hematite and magnetite are the main magnetic carriers. The hard and medium coercivity fractions are unblocked between ~600\u00a0\u00b0C and 680\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of hematite. The gradual decrease in the medium and soft components between 300\u00a0\u00b0C and 580\u00a0\u00b0C may reflect minor magnetite (Fig. 5\n). Sample N2 (Aguachica, locality 6) shows all three coercivity fractions being fully unblocked at ~580\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that magnetite is the only appreciable magnetic phase. In samples AM20 (Arcabuco, Locality1), BJ2 (Bucaramanga, locality 4), and GR (southern Santander Massif, locality 5), the hard fraction exhibits a distinct drop in magnetization between room temperature and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of appreciable goethite (Fig. 5).\nThe analysis of eleven polished thin-sections representative of the six areas reveals the presence of abundant authigenic hematite, as fine, translucent grain coatings, and very low modal concentration (<<1% vol) of detrital oxide grains, which appear to include magnetite, maghemite, and\/or specular hematite (Supplementary materials 4). These observations are consistent with the IRM acquisition data from these rocks.\n\n\n4.3\nMagnetic fabric: AMS data\n\n4.3.1\nGeneral results\nA total of 47 sites in fine-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones gave interpretable AMS results with a clear magnetic fabric; the AMS parameters for these sites are reported in Table 1\n. The bulk magnetic susceptibility of rocks from the 47 sites (Fig. 6\n, Table 1) is low, with an average Km\u00a0=\u00a0232.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI) and a minimum value of 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI) (Table 1). The average mean susceptibility (Km) suggests that ferrimagnetic mineral (s.l) phases are minor in concentration and that paramagnetic minerals define the AMS low-field susceptibility (Rochette, 1987; Rochette et al., 1992; Par\u00e9s and van der Pluijm, 2002). Sites N3, N4, N5 from volcaniclastic rocks of Nore\u00e1n Formation (Aguachica, locality 6), sites JD and AJ17 from Jord\u00e1n Formation (southern Santander Massif, locality 5 and Mesas, locality 3, respectively) and site AM19 from Montebel Formation (Arcabuco anticlinorium, locality 1) show bulk susceptibility values of Km above ~300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (Table 1), suggesting that the AMS is controlled by paramagnetic minerals also with a hematite and magnetite\/maghemite contribution (Hrouda, 2010).\nFor sites SJ8, SJ10, SJ15 (Mesas, locality 3) and GR (southern Santander Massif, locality 5), (Fig. 6, Table 1), the K\n\nmax\n axes all cluster close to the normal to bedding, and the Km values are low (220, 300, 78, 180\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (SI), respectively). Rather than an inverse magnetic fabric due to the occurrence of single-domain magnetite (Rochette et al., 1992), the low bulk susceptibilities and the IRM acquisition data preclude a possible occurrence of single-domain particles, suggesting that the inverse fabric is due to the arrangement of AMS carriers by deformation of the rock (Chadima et al., 2009). Previous studies on sedimentary rocks in the Eastern Cordillera reported inverse fabrics in Lower Cretaceous marine clayey-silty rocks exposed in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014) suggested that the observed fabrics were due to a second magnetic phase, possibly siderite, contained in a paramagnetic matrix.\nIf we do not consider the four sites that reflect an apparent inverse fabric, the F parameter for the remaining 43 sites is well defined and internally consistent within each site, with average values of 1.014, and the L parameter has an average value of 1.008, indicating a preference for oblate ellipsoids (Table 1 and Fig. 6). The average value of the parameter T is 0.186 (Table 1, Fig. 6), confirming that general AMS ellipsoids are oblate. However, discarding sites GR, SJ8, SJ10, SJ15, for the 12 sites distributed in all six localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, the parameter T is negative (between \u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.123), indicating prolate AMS ellipsoids (Table 1and Fig. 6). The P\u2032 parameter is low, ranging from 1.003 to 1.075, indicating a sedimentary fabric that is moderately developed and that it has a possible detrital hematite contribution (Table 1and Fig. 6).\n\n\n4.3.2\nAMS results of Arcabuco anticlinorium, locality 1\nEleven sites are distributed in both limbs of the Arcabuco anticlinorium (Supplementary materials 5). In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, magnetic fabrics reveal a spatial progression of sedimentary fabrics, from intermediate\/near primary (oblate) to triaxial \u2013 prolate ellipsoids.\nThe L and F parameters are internally consistent at each site and show average values of 1.011 and 1.015, respectively. Five sites show prolate ellipsoids with the shape parameter T ranging from \u22120.550 to \u22120.123 (Supplementary materials 5). The average P\u2032 parameter is 1.027, suggesting moderately deformed rocks (Supplementary materials 5). Sites AP27, AM21, AM23, and AR25 have P\u2032 values ranging from 1.033 to 1.054 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 1). All sites in the Arcabuco anticlinorium exhibit a magnetic lineation that is oriented NNE, and thus sub-parallel to the axial plane of the fold, which has an orientation of NE, with site mean k\n\nmin\n and k\n\nint\n axes distributed within a girdle (Figs. 7\n and Supplementary materials 5). This distribution is interpreted as the mix of a weakly developed layer-parallel shortening (LPS) and an original sedimentary depositional fabric (Weil and Yonkee, 2009). However, Roperch et al. (2010) interpreted plunging AMS lineations to possibly indicate the result of a complex folding sequence, which is often very difficult to discriminate based on field relations.\n\n\n4.3.3\nAMS results of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, locality 2\nSeven sites are distributed in the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and have magnetic L and F average values of 1.013 and 1.027, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T for these sites is 0.350, suggesting the predominance of oblate ellipsoids (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, five sites show P\u2032 values over 1.030, two of the sites have P\u2032 values ranging from 1.054 to 1.075, suggesting hematite contribution to the AMS (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). Even though the contribution of a ferromagnetic (s.l) component, in six of these seven sites reveal sedimentary fabrics, as defined by K\n\nmin\n axes clustered around the bedding pole (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5); only site (ZG5) shows a triaxial ellipsoid with K\nmin directions forming a girdle oblique to the bedding plane (Supplementary materials 5).\n\n\n4.3.4\nAMS results of Mesas, locality 3 and Bucaramanga, locality 4\nSeventeen sites are distributed in the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). As noted above, three sites (SJ8, SJ10, and SJ15), all in red mudstones of the Jord\u00e1n Formation, have a K\n\nmax\n cluster around the bedding pole (, Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), suggesting inverse magnetic fabrics (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). The remaining fourteen sites have an average L parameter of 1.005, F parameter of 1.010, and T value of 0.251, suggesting the prevalence of oblate ellipsoids (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5). The average P\u2032 value is low (1.016), suggesting very weakly deformed rocks (Figs. 8 and 9\n\n). Three of the sites (SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4) show prolate ellipsoids (Fig. 7 Supplementary materials 5). Three sites (SJ11, SJ14, and SJ16) show scattered principal susceptibility directions (Table 1).\n\n\n4.3.5\nAMS results of Santander Massif, locality 5- and Aguachica, locality 6\nThe paleomagnetic and magnetic fabric (AMS) results from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif provide information bearing on the patterns of deformation that contribute to improving local and regional kinematic models of deformation in the northern Andes. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the AMS data show weak to moderate deformational magnetic fabrics, and magnetic lineations are sub-parallel to the regional trend of structures. \u00a0In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, magnetic lineations are less well-defined, as these rocks preserve a well-defined sedimentary fabric with oblate ellipsoids. Magnetic fabrics in rocks from the Mesas, Bucaramanga and southern Santander Massif suggest that these rocks retain primary, depositional fabrics. On the other hand, rocks exhibiting prolate\/triaxial ellipsoids are located around the main trace of regional faults (e. g., the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and Surat\u00e1\u00a0faults).The seven sites we established in the Santander Massif are distributed in rocks of the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). These sites have low mean L and F values of 1.006 and 1.009, respectively (Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T is 0.120, and the average of P\u2032 is 1.016 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), which suggests the presence of very weak deformation fabrics in the rocks in this part of the Santander Massif. Sites S1, S2, and S3 show well-defined k\n\nmin\n axes that cluster around normals to bedding, indicating the preservation of sedimentary fabrics (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). Sites JD and MJ3 show triaxial ellipsoid fabrics (Supplementary materials 5), and site GR yields a K\n\nmax\n cluster that is parallel to the normal to bedding (Table 1), again suggesting an inverse magnetic fabric (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). In the Aguachica locality, sites N1, N2, N3, N5 all show magnetic fabrics defined by oblate ellipsoids, and site (N4) with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204 is defined as prolate (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). In the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), however, the AMS ellipsoids from Jord\u00e1n Formation are prolate (sites MJ3 and JD) with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.300, respectively. In site MJ2, the AMS ellipsoid is triaxial with a shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.130. Magnetic lineations in sites MJ2 and MJ3 trend SE and are normal to the trace of the Surat\u00e1\u00a0Fault, suggesting a magnetic fabric that originated during extension; this type of fabric is common in inverted basins (Soto et al., 2007, 2008). The steep magnetic lineations (JD) are parallel to the trace of the Surat\u00e1\u00a0Fault, and these are interpreted to have probably originated during the fault inversion. Only in SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4 sites in Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, the AMS ellipsoids are prolate with\u00a0T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.185,\u00a0\u22120.557, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.561, respectively (Fig. 7\u00a0and Supplementary materials\u00a05). In Aguachica (locality 6), the AMS ellipsoids are interpreted as sedimentary fabrics (sites N1, N3, and N5), and\u00a0K\n\nmin\n\u00a0axes are clustered around the bedding pole. In site N4, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as prolate with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204, and in site N2, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as triaxial with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.189 (Fig. 7\u00a0and Supplementary materials\u00a05). In both sites, deformation is linked to contractional splays of Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 9 and Supplementary materials\u00a05), as suggested by\u00a0Velandia (2017).\nThe seven sites we established in the Santander Massif are distributed in rocks of the hanging wall of the Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). These sites have low mean L and F values of 1.006 and 1.009, respectively (Supplementary materials 5). The average of the shape parameter T is 0.120, and the average of P\u2032 is 1.016 (Table 1 and Supplementary materials 5), which suggests the presence of very weak deformation fabrics in the rocks in this part of the Santander Massif. Sites S1, S2, and S3 show well-defined k\n\nmin\n axes that cluster around normals to bedding, indicating the preservation of sedimentary fabrics (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5). Sites JD and MJ3 show triaxial ellipsoid fabrics (Supplementary materials 5), and site GR yields a K\n\nmax\n cluster that is parallel to the normal to bedding (Table 1), again suggesting an inverse magnetic fabric (e.g., Rochette et al., 1992). In the Aguachica locality, sites N1, N2, N3, N5 all show magnetic fabrics defined by oblate ellipsoids, and site (N4) with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204 is defined as prolate (Fig. 7 and Supplementary materials 5).\n\n\n\n4.4\nPaleomagnetism\n\n4.4.1\nDemagnetization behavior\nIn the context of our interpretation of the paleomagnetic data reported here, we apply the following criteria and\/or assumptions: 1) The ChRM recorded by accepted sites is primary and is carried by early-formed authigenic hematite as well as a combination of detrital hematite and magnetite. 2) magnetization components resolved in progressive demagnetization as free-floating line segments are associated with maximum angular deviation (MAD) values well less than 20\u00b0, and that \u03b1\n95 confidence limits for estimated site mean directions are also well less than 20o. 3) Estimated site mean directions, on an individual basis, given our strategy of sampling multiple beds at a site provide a reasonable estimate of the time-averaged geomagnetic field (GAD field direction) at the time of magnetization acquisition during an interval of either normal or reverse polarity.\nThe Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous strata that we sampled from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif are moderately magnetic with average NRM intensities around 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0A\/m (Fig. 8). Notably, mudstone samples from the Montebel Formation in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) have uniformly lower intensities, with the NRM ~1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0A\/m. The response to progressive demagnetization by these sedimentary rocks is straightforward, with normal and reverse polarity magnetizations sufficiently well-isolated. A viscous magnetization was removed over the first few steps of thermal treatment up to ~200\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 8). Demagnetization diagrams from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif show multivectorial paths (Fig. 8). Sites displaying univectorial paths (e.g., B1, S1) (Fig. 8) define magnetizations that are oriented to the north and exhibit high laboratory unblocking temperatures in the range from ~500 to 680\u00a0\u00b0C. A ChRM is typically resolved between ~500 and 680\u00a0\u00b0C, although for some specimens, the ChRM was isolated between 400 and 680\u00a0\u00b0C. The overall demagnetization response indicates that hematite is the main magnetization carrier with a possible coexistence with magnetite (Fig. 8).\nAs a result, a total of 39 sites (out of 47 sites sampled) passed the above quality criteria. However, for the sites AP27, AM21, B4, S3, and N5, the site-mean directions were defined with specimens from only three independent samples. Paleomagnetic directions yielded unanchored line fits with maximum angular deviation values between 2.8\u00b0 and 19.9\u00b0 (Fig. 8). The remaining eight sites yielded scattered magnetization directions and were discarded from further considerations (Table 2\n). After tilt correction (restoration of sedimentary bedding to the paleohorizontal), a total of 27 sites have normal polarity, and the other 12 sites have reverse polarity (Figs. 8, 9, and Table 2). Site-mean directions are usually distinct from the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field direction (D\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 and I\u00a0=\u00a014\u00b0) (Fig. 9). Directions for sites AM19, AR24, B1, B2, ZLS and ZLS2, in in situ coordinates, are close to the GAD field direction; however, specimens (sites AM19 and ZLS2) and over\/underlayer sites have reverse and normal polarities, excluding a possible recent magnetic overprint of those sites.\n\n\n4.4.2\nReversal and fold tests for ChRM by study area\nThe reversal test for accepted sites from the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1) and the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) is classified as class C. The reversal test for Mesas (locality 3) is classified as negative, and for Bucaramanga (locality 4) and southern Santander Massif (locality 5) is indeterminate. The fold test in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), Bucaramanga (locality 4), and Aguachica (locality 6) reveals a maximum eigenvalue (T) between 3 and 49, 23 to 70, and 35 to 90, respectively, suggesting, at face value, syn-tilting magnetizations. The fold test in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2), Mesas (locality 3), and southern Santander Massif (locality 5) reveals a maximum eigenvalue (T) between 72 and 159, 94 to 150, and 71 to 151, respectively, suggesting pre-folding magnetizations.\nDespite the overall outcomes of both reversal and fold tests, which may reflect the relatively small number of data used for specific localities and the possibility of differential rotation within specific localities, the preservation of a primary remnant magnetization (Fig. 9) may be supported by the following results: (1) the recording of both normal and reverse polarity in our 39 sites from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif, despite the different results of the reversal test, and (2) results of fold tests suggesting either a syn-tilting or pre-folding magnetizations. Therefore, field tests and magnetic mineralogy data allow us considering that the ChRM recorded by accepted sites is primary and is carried by early-formed authigenic hematite as well as a combination of detrital hematite and magnetite.\n\n\n4.4.3\nInclination correction\nWe combined all the individual sample data from all accepted sites in all localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif and applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method of Tauxe et al. (2008) on data from 270 independent samples (Supplementary materials 6).). If all of these samples are included as a single set, the unflattening (correction) procedure tracks the changes from ~15.0\u00b0 before unflattening (observed result) to ~36.9\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.39 (Supplementary materials 6). For the 157 samples from just sites in the Lower Jurassic strata (Supplementary materials 6), the unflattening procedure tracks the changes from ~16.7\u00b0 before unflattening (observed) to ~33.5\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.45 (Supplementary materials 6). Finally, for the 113 samples from Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata (Supplementary materials 6), the unflattening procedure tracks the changes from ~11.2\u00b0 before unflattening (observed) to ~28.1\u00b0 after unflattening and is associated with an f value ~0.37 (Supplementary materials 6). The estimated f value for the second data set, from the Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata, is unusually low for these kinds of sedimentary rocks, and we suspect that this is an artifact of a relatively small sample data set. To avoid possible bias, the inclination shallowing effects were also corrected with Pmagpy (Tauxe et al., 2016) using a flattening factor (f) value of (0.6) based on data reported for similar types of sedimentary rocks (Bilardello and Kodama, 2010; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021) and the results are summarized by sites in Table 2 and formations in Table 3.\nWe combined all the individual sample data from all accepted sites in all localities of the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif and applied the elongation-inclination (E-I) method of Tauxe et al.

We used the expected directions derived from the 150\u00a0Ma (latitude 87.0\u00b0N, longitude 187.30\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a06.4\u00b0), 160\u00a0Ma (latitude 88.0\u00b0N, longitude 124.9\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a05.1\u00b0), 180\u00a0Ma (latitude 83.4\u00b0N, longitude 38.8\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a03.4\u00b0), 190\u00a0Ma (latitude 78.5\u00b0N, longitude 41.4\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a02.9\u00b0) and the 200\u00a0Ma (latitude 74.4\u00b0N, longitude 58.7\u00b0E, and A95\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00b0) Torsvik et al. (2012) poles (Table 2) and rotated into the coordinate frame of the South America Plate (Koymans et al., 2016).\nIn the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), after tilt correction, seven sites are of normal polarity. Sites AM19, AM23, AR18, and AR24 show north-directed declinations and shallow to moderate positive inclination. Sites AP27, AR22 show northeast seeking declination and shallow positive inclination. Site AR28 shows a northwest seeking and moderate positive inclination (Fig. 11 and Table 2). The other two sites are of reverse polarity (AM21 and AR25) with southward declination and shallow negative and positive inclinations (Fig. 11A and Table 2).\nFor the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2), after tilt correction, five sites of the Gir\u00f3n Group are of normal polarity and show northeast seeking declination and moderate to shallow positive inclination. Two sites are of reverse polarity with southward declination and moderate to shallow negative and positive inclination (Fig. 11B and Table 2).\nIn the Mesas and Bucaramanga area (localities 3 and 4), after tilt correction, eight sites of the Jord\u00e1n Formation and Gir\u00f3n Group are of normal polarity, showing a northward to northeast declination and moderate to shallow inclinations of both positive and negative values. The other six sites in the Jord\u00e1n Formation are of reverse polarity with southwest to westward declinations and moderate to shallow negative and positive inclinations (Fig. 11C and Table 2). Finally, in the Santander Massif and Aguachica (localities 5 and 6), after tilt correction, seven sites are of normal polarity with scattered declinations. Site JD of the Jord\u00e1n Formation yields a northeastward declination and shallow positive inclination. Sites N3, N4, and N5 of the Nore\u00e1n Formation show a northward declination and shallow negative and positive inclinations. Sites S1, S2, and S3 of the Gir\u00f3n Group show a northwest declination and shallow positive inclinations. Two sites of Jord\u00e1n (MJ2) and Nere\u00e1n (N2) formations are of reverse polarity with southward declination and shallow positive inclinations) (Fig. 11D and Table 2).\nBased on our sampling strategy and the criteria\/assumptions described above, if individual site-mean directions provide a sufficient average of the field, then the overall dispersion in site-mean declination data, which is considerably greater than the dispersion in inclination data, is plausibly interpreted to be in large part due to vertical axis rotations (Fig. 9). The new paleomagnetic results in tilt-corrected coordinates reported here from the northern Eastern Cordillera in the Arcabuco anticlinorium (locality 1), based on appropriate age reference directions derived from reference paleomagnetic pole positions (Torsvik et al., 2012), show that observed directional discordances imply five sites with low, insignificant magnitudes of CW sense rotation to more moderate values, from 1.4\u00b0 +\/\u2212 3.9\u00b0 to 36.4\u00b0 +\/\u2212 9.6\u00b0 and four sites with CCW senses, some of which are significant, ranging from \u221251.5\u00b0 +\/\u2212 24.7\u00b0 to - 5.9\u00b0 +\/\u2212 10.8\u00b0 (Figs. 9 and 10\n, Table 2).\nDeclination data from sites in the forelimb of Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (locality 2) and Mesas- Bucaramanga (localities 3 and 4) in comparison to reference directions (Torsvik et al., 2012) imply CW rotations up to 90.7\u00b0 +\/\u2212 9.8\u00b0 (maximum rotation values documented in this work), with a general trend in the magnitude of rotation decreasing to the north (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2).\nIn the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), discordances with respect to expected directions derived from paleopoles of Torsvik et al. (2012) imply CCW rotations up to \u221233.1\u00b0 +\/\u2212 11.3\u00b0 (sites S1, S2, and S3) and CW rotations up to 42.2\u00b0 +\/\u2212 12.4\u00b0 (site JD) (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). In Aguachica (locality 6), data from two sites (N2 and N4) suggest low, insignificant magnitude of CW rotation up to 9.2\u00b110.6 and two sites (N3 and N5) suggest a minor CCW rotation up to \u221212.6\u00b15.4 (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2).\n\n\n4.4.5\nPaleolatitude estimates\nThe flattening (F) parameter is defined as the difference between the expected and observed inclinations, assuming that the observed data set represents an adequate time-averaging of the paleomagnetic field. A positive flattening occurs when the observed inclination is lower than the expected inclination, which is suggestive of northward translations in the northern hemisphere. Based on paleopoles reported by Torsvik et al. (2012), only 13 sites are characterized by positive flattening values (Table 2). A total of 26 sites are characterized by negative flattening values (Table 3), 13 sites show flattening values with magnitudes greater than 15\u00b0, and those sites cannot be used for latitudinal estimations, probably due to a bias during the inclination correction that was applied, as suggested by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021). Discarding the data from these 13 sites (Table 2), estimated paleolatitudes, calculated for specific formations (Table 3, Supplementary materials 6), were compared with reference pole information from Torsvik et al. (2012) and other paleolatitude estimates based on results from previous studies (Bayona et al., 2006, 2010; Nova et al., 2012; Jim\u00e9nez et al.,2021) (Supplementary materials 6). The paleolatitude estimates, based on data corrected for a plausible magnitude of inclination shallowing (unflattened) in this study lie within the confidence interval of the data set provided by Torsvik et al. (2012) (Supplementary materials 6). Unflattened paleolatitudes for the Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous formations from the northern part of the Eastern Cordillera and the Santander Massif lie over the confidence interval of Torsvik et al. (2012), suggesting displacements from original shallow paleolatitude positions (Supplementary materials 6).\nThe flattening (F) parameter is defined as the difference between the expected and observed inclinations, assuming that the observed data set represents an adequate time-averaging of the paleomagnetic field.

Magnetic susceptibility lineations reported from Jurassic rocks in the Arcabuco anticlinorium are oriented subparallel to the regional trend of the northern Eastern Cordillera and they have shallow plunge values, on average 14.6o (Fig. 7, Table 1). These results are consistent with magnetic lineations reported from marine Cretaceous rocks in the forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium and also Cenozoic continental-affinity strata in the footwall of Boyac\u00e1 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2014), the development of extension-related normal faults during the early Mesozoic and the subsequent shortening phase under noncoaxial strain may have caused the lineations to deviate from the horizontal in a complex, multi-stage fold sequence as suggested by Roperch et al. (2010).\nIn the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and Santander Massif localities, K\n\nmin\n axes are clustered around the normal to sedimentary bedding, and K\n\nmax\n and K\n\nint\n axes define a foliation that is parallel to subparallel to bedding attitudes, confirming the preservation of predominantly sedimentary magnetic fabrics (Fig. 7).\n\n5\n5\n5\n\nIn the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), however, the AMS ellipsoids from Jord\u00e1n Formation are prolate (sites MJ3 and JD) with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.737 and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.300, respectively. In site MJ2, the AMS ellipsoid is triaxial with a shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.130. Magnetic lineations in sites MJ2 and MJ3 trend SE and are normal to the trace of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, suggesting a magnetic fabric that originated during extension; this type of fabric is common in inverted basins (Soto et al., 2007, 2008). The steep magnetic lineations (JD) are parallel to the trace of the Surat\u00e1 Fault, and these are interpreted to have probably originated during the fault inversion. Only in SJ9, BJ1, and BJ4 sites in Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, the AMS ellipsoids are prolate with T\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.185, \u22120.557, and\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.561, respectively (Fig.7 and Supplementary materials 5). In Aguachica (locality 6), the AMS ellipsoids are interpreted as sedimentary fabrics (sites N1, N3, and N5), and K\n\nmin\n axes are clustered around the bedding pole. In site N4, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as prolate with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204, and in site N2, the AMS ellipsoid is interpreted as triaxial with shape factor (T)\u00a0=\u00a00.189 (Fig.7 and Supplementary materials 5). In both sites, deformation is linked to contractional splays of Bucaramanga Fault (Fig. 9 and Supplementary materials 5), as suggested by Velandia (2017).\n\n\n5.2\nInferred vertical axis rotations\nBased on data from the northern Eastern Cordillera and the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the magnitude of rotations experienced by the back limb and the core of the Arcabuco anticlinorium is less than about 12\u00b0, in agreement with data reported for marine Cretaceous rocks in the footwall of the Boyac\u00e1 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014) and these results are interpreted to confirm that the axial zone of the northern Eastern Cordillera has not experienced appreciable crustal rotation (Fig. 10). There are exceptions to this general interpretation, in that data from four sites located in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium show significant declination discordances and these may be linked to local strike-slip structures (Fig. 10 and supplementary material 1). Vertical axis rotations are related to displacement along strike-slip faults (Piper et al., 1997; Sussman et al., 2004; Randall et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2004, 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015). The magnitude of vertical axes rotations may under certain circumstances follow the power-law rheology model (England et al., 1985) in which case there is a relation between the distance from a fault trace and the magnitude of rotation. Local strike-slip faults in the Arcabuco anticlinorium show relatively low displacement, and the sites are spaced from the fault trace, therefore there are variations or lacks of the observed rotations between sites. The inferred, significant CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif are linked to NE-SW oriented right-lateral strike-slip faults (e.g., Surat\u00e1 and El Monje faults) (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). The inferred CCW rotations in the Santander Massif are linked to regional strike-slip displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). As above, thickness variations in sequences of Jurassic age strata are interpreted as a consequence of the development of a Triassic-Jurassic transtensional basin (Bayona et al., 2006; Sarmiento-Rojas et al., 2006). According to Sarmiento-Rojas et al. (2006), the Triassic-Jurassic transtensional basins were narrow and progressively increased in width during deformation. The strike-slip component gradually decreased, and the magnitude of dip-slip displacement increased. Bayona et al. (2006) reported CCW rotations of ~90\u00b0 from rocks of the Jord\u00e1n Formation in the Mesas locality and related this deformation to localized deformation of transverse normal structures. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported data from Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks that supported a CW rotation of ~48\u00b0 in the forelimb of the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium as a consequence of displacement along the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and NE-SW transverse faults (e.g., El Monje Fault), parallel to the Surat\u00e1 Fault.\nPaleogeographic reconstructions of northwest South America and adjacent areas in Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous time, in part derived from paleomagnetic data, suggest that the Maya Block (Mexico) was juxtaposed against northern South America (Bartok et al., 2015; Pindell and Kennan, 2001) with a CCW rotation of up to about 50\u00b0 after ca. 154\u00a0Ma (Pindell et al., 2006). According to Kneller and Johnson (2011), the onset of the counterclockwise rotation of the Yucat\u00e1n block took place after ca. 176\u00a0Ma, in response to the propagation of seafloor spreading into the Proto\u2013Caribbean Sea. During Tithonian to Berriasian time, the rotation of the Maya Block ceased (Pindell and Dewey, 1982; Pindell and Kennan, 2009; Molina-Garza et al., 1992; God\u00ednez-Urban et al., 2011). Pindell et al. (2021) suggested a moderate magnitude of westward extension of the northern Andes to accommodate the movement of Yucatan block.\n\nJim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported CW rotations of ~45\u00b0 for a complete section of Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous strata of the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium (Fig. 10), and the estimated rotations are inferred to be related to regional Neogene strike-slip displacements of the Bucaramanga Fault and the inversion of early-formed normal faults into NE-SW trending reverse structures with right-lateral displacement components. Velandia et al. (2020) propose a domino-style model for the deformation of the southern Santander Massif, involving displacement on the longitudinal left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault and NE-SW transverse inner faults with a right-lateral component in the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities. According to Velandia et al. (2020) the transpressional regime of the southern Santander Massif differs from the compressive regime that characterizes nearby crustal elements (Perij\u00e1 Range, or the northern Eastern Cordillera in the Floresta Massif). The domino-style model (Velandia et al., 2020) suggests CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif and implies the presence of CCW rotated structural blocks in the footwall of the Bucaramanga Fault and the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium locality. The domino-style model also implies the presence of a second regional NNW left-lateral fault, parallel to the Bucaramanga Fault. Velandia (2017) described geomorphologic evidence for the proposed trace of the left-lateral Lebrija Fault within the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium. Another possible model is the conjugate set of bounding faults forming a strike-slip domain (Velandia, 2017; Velandia et al., 2020). This model explains the CW rotations inferred for Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, Bucaramanga area, and the Mesas area, and integrates displacement along the NNW left-lateral Lebrija Fault. However, regional maps and cross-sections (e.g., Ward et al., 1973; Tes\u00f3n et al., 2013; Caballero et al., 2013) show the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium to be a structural domain affected by reverse faulting along with inversion structures without evidence of regional NNW strike-slip faults. In the Maracaibo block and Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, CW rotations (~45\u00b0) are associated with Neogene displacement along the Bocon\u00f3 Fault (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014) and regional and local strike-slip faults (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2021), respectively. According to Nova et al. (2012) CW rotations in the Perij\u00e1 Range are up to about 45\u00b0 (Fig. 11\n). Montes et al. (2003) proposed the opening of the Lower Magdalena Valley to have provided the mechanism for regional CW rotation.\nIn our hypothesized model, the rotation pattern in the northern Andes is related to the reactivation of NE-trending normal \/transverse structures (e.g., the El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults) as right-lateral faults (Velandia, 2017; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012). Sarmiento (2011) reported several subsurface deformation zones of Eocene age (Figs. 1 and 10), forming an arch with an approximate N-S orientation, that may be product of reactivation of Mesozoic structures. According to Costantino et al. (2021), the tectonic inversion in the Eastern Cordillera started during the Oligocene, and is characterized by thick-skinned style of crustal deformation involving uplift of the crystalline basement along high angle reverse faults. These transverse faults form structural and stratigraphic limits between deforming blocks, defining a systematic pattern of moderate magnitude clockwise rotation (Fig. 11C). Locally, in Bucaramanga and Aguachica (localities 4 and 6, respectively), the magnitude of rotation decreases because the magnitude of total displacement along the transverse faults is minor to essentially zero and this may be a reflection of the structural block aspect ratio, with the long axis oriented parallel to the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n5.3\nPaleolatitude estimates of northern Andes tectonic elements\nAccording to Castillo et al. (1991), the M\u00e9rida Andes did not experience significant latitudinal displacement with respect to the South American craton. Bayona et al. (2006, 2010) proposed that crustal elements exposing Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic age rocks had been translated northward with respect to stable South America. According to Molina-Garza et al. (2020), Lower and Middle Jurassic strata exposed in Central Oaxaca and other regions of central and eastern Mexico were deposited at near-equatorial paleolatitudes and thus have been translated northward a considerable distance. Paleogeographic reconstruction of northern South America during the Jurassic implies an overlap of the central Andes of Colombia with southern Mexico. In addition, according to Nova et al. (2012), the Perij\u00e1 Range experienced no significant latitudinal displacement and these workers invoked the presence of a paleostructure to explain the latitudinal discrepancy between a stable Perij\u00e1 Range and a displaced Santa Marta Massif. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) discussed the limitations of paleolatitude estimates based on uncorrected inclinations reported in several earlier paleomagnetic investigations of sedimentary sequences in the northern Andes. Therefore, paleolatitudes originally estimated for the Perij\u00e1 Range area and other northern blocks (e.g., Guajira block) could be ambiguous and require further detailed analysis, as Nova et al. (2019) suggested. Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) reported corrected inclination data for the Gir\u00f3n Group in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium and discussed some potential limitations, based on specific data sets, of using the elongation-inclination (E\u2013I) method of Tauxe et al. (2008). According to Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021), the paleolatitude for the Gir\u00f3n Group strata in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, after correction for inclination shallowing using an f value of 0.6, is estimated to be about 7.0\u00b0 N\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4o, which corresponds to the modern\u2013day latitude, and this estimate is slightly lower than the 11.3\u00b0N\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.4o paleolatitude estimate based on uncorrected inclination data earlier reported by Bayona et al., (2006) (Supplementary materials 6).\nAccording to Castillo et al.

(2006) (Supplementary materials 6) probably because for very shallow inclinations the correction is of low magnitude. During the Early to Middle Jurassic, the tectonic elements (e.g., Santa Marta, Santander and Floresta massifs) associated with the subduction process of the Farallon Plate were located at very shallow latitudes (Supplementary materials 6). During the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, at the time of deposition of the Gir\u00f3n Group, these tectonic elements were located in the northern hemisphere, at latitudes of ~4\u00b0 to ~7\u00b0N. The magnitude of the latitudinal translation then decreased, and only minor northward translation may have occurred since the Late Jurassic, as suggested by Jim\u00e9nez et al. (2021) (Supplementary materials 6). According to Gerritsen et al. (2022) the paleopoles, quantify the past position of rocks relative to the geomagnetic pole and constrain tectonic reconstructions and apparent polar wander paths (APWPs). Gerritsen et al. (2022) suggest the paleopoles calculation improves using multiple samples per site. Therefore the Nore\u00e1n, Jord\u00e1n and La Rusia formations, and the Gir\u00f3n Group are the best units to improve the precision of paleopole in future studies.\nThe paleolatitude estimate for Gir\u00f3n Group rocks exposed in the southern Santander Massif iscoherent with the uncorrected paleolatitudes reported by Bayona et al.

During the Neogene, at least 45\u00a0km of displacement along the left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault reactivated transverse secondary faults (e.g., El Monje and Surat\u00e1 Faults) (Fig. 11C). Major rotations (> 90\u00b0) affected the Mesas and Bucaramanga localities, where the block aspect ratio (Randall et al., 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014) (short\/long axis) is 1:1, and blocks are limited in dimension (width) by NE strike-slip faults. Crustal blocks experienced minimal rotation (< 10\u00b0) in Aguachica (locality 6) because of a more elongated block aspect ratio (Randall et al., 2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Moreno et al., 2014), with the long axis oriented parallel to Bucaramanga Fault. In the southern Santander Massif (locality 5), both CW rotations in relation to displacement along NE strike-slip faults (e.g., Surat\u00e1 Fault) and CCW rotations are related to Neogene displacements along the Bucaramanga Fault.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nThe vertical axis rotations confirm the nonrotational nature of the chain. Local strike-slip faults are responsible for the inferred CW and CCW sense rotations in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium. In the northern Eastern Cordillera, estimated rotations are lower in magnitude and often not statistically significant, and deformation is dissipated with the layer parallel shortening erasing the primary depositional magnetic fabric. The inferred CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, as indicated by systematic declination data, are linked to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along several structures (e.g., the El Monje Fault). The inferred CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif are explained as a consequence of displacement along the regional, left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault. In the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif localities, the systematic CW rotations are related to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along transverse faults reactivated as a consequence of Neogene displacement on the Bucaramanga Fault. In the northern area, at the Aguachica locality, the magnitudes of inferred vertical axis rotations are relatively low, probably controlled by the block aspect ratio, with the long axis oriented parallel to Bucaramanga Fault. The block rotatio In our hypothesized model, the rotation pattern in the northern Andes is related to the reactivation of NE-trending normal \/transverse structures (e.g., the El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults) as right-lateral faults (Velandia, 2017; Cu\u00e9llar et al., 2012). Sarmiento (2011) reported several subsurface deformation zones of Eocene age (Figs. 1 and 10), forming an arch with an approximate N-S orientation, that may be product of reactivation of Mesozoic structures. ns of a clockwise sense that we report are consistent with the GPS data showing that the northern Andes is moving northeastward at a rate of about 8.6\u00a0mm\/yr (Mora-P\u00e1ez et al., 2020) (Figs. 1A and 11C). In the Santander Massif and the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera, during the time interval of tectonic inversion, regional left lateral displacement along the Bucaramanga Fault (> 45\u00a0km) reactivated ancient normal faults as right-lateral faults (e.g., El Monje and Surat\u00e1 faults). In these rigid blocks, deformation is dissipated with systematic vertical axis rotations ranging up to about 90\u00b0, and the magnetic fabric data show that these rocks preserve primary fabrics. During the Early Jurassic (time of deposition of the Jord\u00e1n and Nore\u00e1n formations), the tectonic blocks were located at shallow latitudes (Fig. 11A Supplementary materials 6). During the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, at the time of deposition of the La Rusia Formation and the Gir\u00f3n Group, those tectonics blocks had been translated into the northern hemisphere, at latitudes of ~4\u00b0 to ~7\u00b0N. Since the Early Cretaceous, the magnitude of the latitudinal translation decreased, and only minor northward translation occurred (Fig. 11B and Supplementary materials 6).\nThe paleomagnetic and magnetic fabric (AMS) results from the northern Eastern Cordillera and Santander Massif provide information bearing on the patterns of deformation that contribute to improving local and regional kinematic models of deformation in the northern Andes. In the Arcabuco anticlinorium, the AMS data show weak to moderate deformational magnetic fabrics, and magnetic lineations are sub-parallel to the regional trend of structures. The vertical axis rotations confirm the nonrotational nature of the chain. Local strike-slip faults are responsible for the inferred CW and CCW sense rotations in the core and forelimb of the Arcabuco anticlinorium. In the northern Eastern Cordillera, estimated rotations are lower in magnitude and often not statistically significant, and deformation is dissipated with the layer parallel shortening erasing the primary depositional magnetic fabric. In the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, magnetic lineations are less well-defined, as these rocks preserve a well-defined sedimentary fabric with oblate ellipsoids. The inferred CW rotations in the Los Yarigu\u00edes anticlinorium, as indicated by systematic declination data, are linked to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along several structures (e.g., the El Monje Fault). Magnetic fabrics in rocks from the Mesas, Bucaramanga and southern Santander Massif suggest that these rocks retain primary, depositional fabrics. On the other hand, rocks exhibiting prolate\/triaxial ellipsoids are located around the main trace of regional faults (e. g., the Bucaramanga, Su\u00e1rez, and Surat\u00e1 faults). The inferred CCW rotations in the southern Santander Massif are explained as a consequence of displacement along the regional, left-lateral Bucaramanga Fault. In the Mesas, Bucaramanga, and southern Santander Massif localities, the systematic CW rotations are related to right-lateral strike-slip displacements along transverse faults reactivated as a consequence of Neogene displacement on the Bucaramanga Fault.

Quaternary faults are present and run through the country, including through metropolitan Seoul (Choi et al., 2012; Bae and Lee, 2016). Although past major earthquakes are known from historical recordings (Lee and Yang, 2006; Park et al., 2020), the Peninsula has until recent days been in a stable intraplate seismic state sandwiched between Eurasian, and Pacific-Philippine plates (Fig. 1\n). The 2011 Tohoku-Oki mega-thrust Mw 9.0 earthquake in Japan appears to have changed the situation resulting in more plus Mw 5.0 earthquakes being recorded in the Peninsula since 2011, compared to only 5 events since the 70s up to 2011 (Hong et al., 2018). It resulted in coseismic displacements of ~2\u20134\u00a0cm around the east and west coasts of the Korean Peninsula and weakened the Korean crust, likely and partly increasing the seismic activity (Hong et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2018). This includes the 2016 Mw 5.4 (ML 5.8) Gyeongju earthquake, the largest event recorded in the history of recent seismic monitoring in South Korea.\nSouth Korea is a densely populated country including metropolitan Seoul area that hosts over 20 million inhabitants. Any major earthquake in the region can be a significant threat to the people as well as can give damages to historical buildings. It is therefore essential that active faults and the relationship(s) between triggering mechanisms and fault geometry are identified for better earthquake magnitude estimations (Leonard, 2010; Malehmir et al., 2016), preparedness, and city planning. However, due to the high population density, mapping of these fault systems is challenging in this noisy and logistically difficult mega-city environment. There is a great need for improved understating of subsurface geology in major cities, especially since many mega-cities are in regions of high geohazard risks (Zoback et al., 2010). Geophysical methods such as seismics can be useful for this purpose (Malehmir et al., 2011). Ambient vibrational noise is however a major challenge for urban seismic data acquisition, as well as ground-receiver coupling (Brodic et al., 2015; Malehmir et al., 2015). Encouraging results obtained in city environment using new acquisition setups and systems such as digital sensors (Malehmir et al., 2016; Malehmir et al., 2017; Kammann et al., 2019) can be used in mega-cities to define the deep geometry of faults and its relationship with seismicity clusters. For this reason, two reflection seismic profiles (Fig. 1) were planned and acquired during November 2020, which are the focus of this study.\n\n\n2\nBackground geology and seismicity\nKorean peninsula sits in the Eurasian plate at the contact with the west Pacific-Philippine plate (Fig. 1). The basement rocks are cut by various rifts forming, in the Palaeozoic period, linear basement features, and in Mesozoic and Cenozoic, troughs filled with thick continental clastic sediments (Kim, 1997). Tectonic evolution of the peninsula can be divided into three phases (Kim, 1997) namely (1) ancient geosyncline stage that occurred during Archean (2.6\u00a0Ga) to Proterozoic (1.8\u00a0Ga), (2) stable platform stage that occurred during Middle Proterozoic (1.7\u00a0Ga) to Late Palaeozoic (260\u00a0Ma) and (3) an intense stage influenced by the movement of the west Pacific plate during Mesozoic (230\u00a0Ma) to Holocene (present). The latter stage is more significant when studying the fault systems, magmatism, and deformation evolution of basement rocks. It is generally believed that quaternary tectonics are related to volcanic activities and that basement faults formed during the Mesozoic are responsible for much of the seismicity observed in the region.\nThe South Korean government has supported several initiatives to study the current state of seismicity and map active faults in the country. Based on these studies (Hong et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021), two sites were chosen for the reflection seismic surveys (Fig. 1a). Seismic activity was a primary consideration in choosing the sites (Fig. 1a). Profile 1 was positioned on the northern side of the metropolitan Seoul and profile 2 in the central part of the city. Both profiles cross the Chugaryeong crustal-scale fault where seismicity appears to show a spatial relationship with the fault. The Pocheon and Wangsukcheon faults, mapped east of the Chugaryeong fault (Fig. 1b), appear to form splay faults as they reach in the city south of profile 2. The Pocheon fault is mapped approximately 17\u00a0km east of profile 1 and immediately east of profile 2 (Fig. 1c). Other fault systems are likely also present between the Chugaryeong and Pocheon faults but covered or have no surface expressions. Recent focal mechanism data (Fig. 1c) along the Chugaryeong fault show a near-vertical (or steep) strike-slip sense of movement (Hong et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021).\n\n\n3\nReflection seismic data\nTwo 9\u00a0t vibrators (Figs. 2 and 3\n\n and supplementary Fig. S1) in a phase-locked time-synchronized manner were used to acquire the data. Along profile 1, four repeated sweeps at every shot location were used while for profile 2 five sweeps were used. The data quality is relatively good along profile 1 with occasionally strong reflections even observed in the raw shot gathers (Fig. 4\n) while along profile 2 data are much noisier. For profile 2, first arrivals were only occasionally observed beyond 3\u00a0km and, in most cases, limited to 500\u20131000\u00a0m offsets.\nThe processing steps and parameters were chosen and tailored to enhance the reflectivity in the data as much as possible. The landstreamer data processing focused on the bedrock reflection while the wireless data aimed at deeper reflections. The top 200\u00a0ms of the merged data is from the landstreamer. The wireless data cannot image the bedrock as the overburden effect is removed during the refraction static corrections and the receiver spacing between the wireless recorders is rather large (i.e., 20\u00a0m) for this purpose. Along profile 1, data processing of the wireless data focused on two-time windows: (1) top 2\u00a0s and (2) 2\u20134\u00a0s data. This strategy was needed as the uppermost 2\u00a0s contain significant surface-wave energy that required median and FK (frequency-wavenumber) filtering. After separate processing, the two datasets were merged amplitude levelled and migrated together.\n\n3.1\nSeismic data acquisition\nData triggering was done via a GPS (global system positioning) time disciplined data acquisition system connected to the streamer and towed by the so-called observer\/recording source (second mini-vib behind, Fig. 3). The source points were positioned between the two mini-vibs at the receiver stations. The min-vibs are approximately 8\u00a0m long. The data acquisition equipped with a GPS-antenna provided microsecond accuracy time sampling and stamping of the active source data on the landstreamer sensors. This time stamping of the active sources in the streamer data were later used to extract their corresponding data from the wireless recorders that were operating in an autonomous mode (passive) during the survey (Fig. S1). Prior to the data acquisition, we spent one full day to optimize sweep parameters and made sure that data quality was sufficient and the two mini-vibs operated simultaneously in a phase-locked manner. The sweep tests included change in the frequency ranges and lengths. We used our earlier experience from crystalline-setting surveys to optimize the testing and limit the number of sweep variables. The sweep tests ranged from 10 to 120\u00a0Hz (12, 14, 16 and 18\u00a0s) as well as 10\u2013140\u00a0Hz and 5\u2013140\u00a0Hz (Figs. 5 and 6\n\n). We noted that the starting 5-Hz sweeps had much more surface-wave energy excited in the data hence decided to use 10\u00a0Hz as the starting frequency and 140\u00a0Hz as the ending one (Table 1\n). For the sweep length, 18\u00a0s produced higher quality data than others tested thus chosen for the data acquisition guaranteeing that low frequencies would have sufficient energy for deeper penetrations.\nAnalysis of the data along profile 2 suggests that occasionally receiver gathers have much higher data quality than the shot gathers. This implies while the ambient noise is high in the city, ground coupling is the main reason for the relatively poor data quality; i.e., where the ground coupling of geophones is good, reasonable quality data with even reflections are observed (c.f., a shot gather against receiver gather in Fig. 7\n).\n\n\n3.2\nSeismic data processing\nBandpass and spectral equalization were effective to partly handle strong surface-waves in the data. Spectral balancing was also applied poststack as well as coherency improvement filters such as FX-deconvolution. Various migration algorithms were applied; however, phase shift migration produced the least migration artefacts and was selected. Different velocities were used for the migration; for profile 1, a 1D velocity between 4000 and 6300\u00a0m\/s was used. For the time-to-depth conversion we used a constant velocity of 6000\u00a0m\/s. Slight changes in the dip (5\u201310 degrees) and positioning (100\u2013300\u00a0m) of the reflections can consequently be expected but this is not so significant for the scale of this study.\nThe important processing steps were refraction static corrections, prestack data enhancement and velocity analysis (Table 2\n). Velocity analysis was important because of the steep and sometimes conflicting dips. The streamer and wireless data were processed separately and then merged later (supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Along profile 1, data processing of the wireless data focused on two different time windows: (1) top 2\u00a0s and (2) 2\u20134\u00a0s data. Once the two parts were processed and imaged, they were then merged and using a levelling amplitude algorithm (Place and Malehmir, 2016), the data amplitudes between the two parts were adjusted (Fig. 8\n).\nAlong profile 2, apart from the conventional processing workflow like that applied along profile 1, a major time and effort was put into removing noisy traces and analysing which receiver gathers had good quality data (Fig. 7) to allow partial stacking of their reflections. This strategy helped to image the steepest reflections observed on the city profile (R4 in supplementary Fig. S4). Given the extreme crooked nature of the profile, we also performed cross-dip analysis (Malehmir et al., 2011) to benefit from the midpoint cloud distributions and make sure reflections not favouring the orientation of the profile could still be imaged and their out-of-the-plane nature identified. This resulted, for example, in a better imaging of a reflection (R5 in supplementary Fig. S4) observed at the most curved location of the profile.\nComplex reflectivity is observed along profile 2 however profile 1 shows better correlation between reflectivity and the clusters of seismicity. A temporal and spatial correction is evident (Fig. 9\n). To complement the bedrock reflection imaging of the landstreamer data, first-break traveltime tomography was also implemented on wireless data since they have much higher offsets than the landstreamer (40\u2013240\u00a0m depending on which profile).\n\n\n\n4\nResults\nProfile 1 is rich in reflectivity from bedrock down to 4\u00a0s (approximately 12\u00a0km depth). An increase in bedrock depth on the landstreamer section has a corresponding velocity decrease and coincides with a gap in the shallow reflectivity where two sets of reflections (R1 and R2) are interrupted by a vertical zone of non-reflectivity (Fig. 10\n). A set of moderately westerly-dipping reflections are also imaged at approximately 4\u20134.5\u00a0km depth and at 8\u20139\u00a0km depth, a series of steep reflections. These two sets of reflectivity bands terminate at two clusters of seismicity. From the source mechanism and the reflectivity pattern, we position the location of the Chugaryeong fault between R1 and R2 as a subvertical fault (Fig. 10a) where an increase in bedrock depth is also observed suggesting a zone of crushed and disturbed rocks. The near-vertical zone of decreased amplitudes between the two sets of reflectivity (R1 and R2) would then be due to no coherent structures to generate reflections.\nThe two clusters of seismicity and reflectivity intersect each other at 4\u20134.5\u00a0km and 8\u20139\u00a0km depth. The seismicity is dominantly locked at the intersections of these three features in the reflection seismic section (Fig. 10b). While there are other smaller features in the seismic section (e.g., the western margin of the section), only the key reflections are focused here. S2 sets of reflectivity appear to be a thicker package, implying an extensive fault or shear zone. However, the most continuous reflective zone intersects the deeper cluster of seismicity.\nAlong profile 2, the images are rather complex showing a strong westerly-dipping reflective band (S3 in Fig. 11\n) on the easternmost side of the profile, extending from the surface down to approximately 1200\u00a0m depth, like S1 reflectivity along profile 1 but at much shallower depths (Fig. 10c), and although about 70\u00a0km to the north, so highly speculative. From surface geological mappings and seismicity data (Fig. 1), a fault can be interpreted where S1 reflectivity is interrupted, extending down to where the seismicity is observed. The bedrock is not well imaged since a limited number of landstreamer sensors were used due to the logistical challenges in the city. The seismicity occurs at 7\u20139\u00a0km depth on the westernmost portion of profile 2 and mainly in this cluster. It occurs at a region of distinct discontinuous reflectivity (e.g., between R3 and R4 in Fig. 11). From the surface expression of topography and subsurface reflectivity patterns, a series of interrupted curved-shaped geological features can be interpreted. These features are likely due to a series of fault systems rather than lithology. The noise level is rather high in the city, and it is not possible to image deeper than 1500\u00a0m. Surface geological mapping suggests that most faults in the region are steep to vertical, although the lack of sufficient exposure and road cuts hinder definite identification of the fault geometries.\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\nReflection sections from the two profiles indicate a direct relationship between the clustered seismicity and reflectivity. The Chugaryeong fault is sub-vertical as it cuts through reflections R1 and R2 and the two sets of reflectivity (S1 and S2) represent splay faults or zones of deformation associated with it. The S1 and S2 deeper bands of reflectivity are either smaller faults between the Pocheon and Wangsukcheon fault systems or being parts of the faults themselves, especially since the Pocheon fault may show itself on the city profile. The Chugaryeong fault is seismically active, and mainly locked at the intersections of these splay faults. The oblique shortening (Fig. 1a) is responsible for the strike-slip faulting at these fault intersections. Similar observations are also reported elsewhere from intracontinental, and splay thrust faults (Jackson, 1992; Jackson, 2002) where counter-clockwise rotation around the vertical axis triggers strike-slip displacement. This observation is important for both public safety consideration and for understanding how future earthquakes may be triggered and at what depth. The Pocheon fault may be also more moderately dipping than earlier thought.\nThe interconnection between seismicity and subsidiary faults has earlier been suggested elsewhere by several authors, however, mainly based on seismological observations (Walters et al., 2018) or where reflection data available in different geological settings (Ahmadi et al., 2015), and large uncertainty in locating the events and without any direct evidence from the subsurface. Fluid diffusion, channelled along fault intersections, is argued for the re-initiation of earthquakes. Interestingly, Gangopadhyay and Talwani (2005), through numerical modelling, also argued that fault intersections, at the presence of a weak crust, are ideal locations for stress build-ups and seismicity(Talwani, 1988). However, they had no subsurface images to support their claim. Furthermore, fault intersections and subsequent stress build-ups are observed to trigger strike slip motions on major faults because of kinematic adjustment and followed by vertical or horizontal movement on the splay faults (Talwani, 1988). These are consistent with the seismicity records along the two profiles and our interpretation of the fault intersections as the controlling factor of seismicity in the region. Notably, the well-known 2017 Pohang earthquake (Mw 5.4) in South Korea is thought to be associated with multiple fault intersections and geometries (Son et al., 2020). This further emphasizes why it is critical to image fault systems in the subsurface and integrate seismological studies with active-source reflection seismic data.\nThe seismicity not only spatially correlates with the fault intersections but also correlates in time (temporally), implying a start-stop mechanism for triggering and re-initiation of seismic events along the Chugaryeong fault. These observations are unique and open up for possibilities to predict where and possibly within what period earthquakes may occur. For the same magnitude seismic event, if geomechanically possible, shallower seismic events can be much more worrying than deeper ones when seismic risks are considered. Our data and the switching between depth and time provide for the first time a window of opportunity for studying risks and predicting potential hazards due to seismicity in the region. Long-term monitoring of seismicity is highly recommended to shed light into the interpretations provided in this study.\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nTwo high-resolution high-fold reflection seismic profiles were acquired in the metropolitan Seoul, South Korea, for studying fault systems with the aim of helping to explain the current seismicity in the Peninsula after the devastating 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The northern profile presents a reflectivity-seismicity relationship. The city and northern profiles have one important feature in common and that is the reflective character from the same fault zone, which we have interpreted to be a splay fault from the sub-vertical Chugaryeong fault. It is an important observation for the citizens in a megacity like Seoul and it is worth verifying. This interpretation along with the observation of clustered seismicity associated with the reflectivity implies that much of the current seismicity in the Korean Peninsula is controlled both temporarily and spatially at the intersection of fault systems forming a major flower structure showing a start-stop faulting mechanism that is both temporally and spatiality controlled at the fault intersections.\n\n\nData availability\nThe seismicity data analysed in this study were collected from the website of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA, http:\/\/www. kma.go.kr). The reflection seismic data are being archived in the Swedish National Data Service (https:\/\/www.snd.gu.se) and additional hard copies are presented in the Supporting Information in the form of shot records and final seismic sections.\n\n\nAuthor contributions\nT.-K\u00b7H initiated the project.

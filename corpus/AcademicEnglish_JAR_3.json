                 The infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a global threat to public health. Vancomycin remains one of the first-line drugs for the treatment of MRSA infections. However, S. aureus isolates with complete resistance to vancomycin have emerged in recent years. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) is mediated by a vanA gene cluster, which is transferred from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Since the first VRSA isolate was recovered from Michigan, USA in 2002, 52 VRSA strains have been isolated worldwide. In this paper, we review the latest progresses in VRSA, highlighting its resistance mechanism, characteristics of VRSA infections, as well as clinical treatments.\n               ","1391":"\n                  The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that ribs shape changes in patients with OI are more relevant for respiratory function than thoracic spine shape. We used 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify rib cage morphology in OI patients and controls, and to investigate its relationship with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1\u202fs (FEV1), expressed as absolute value and as percentage of predicted value (% pred). Regression analyses on the full sample showed a significant relation between rib shape and FEV1, FVC and FVC % pred whereas thoracic spine shape was not related to any parameter. Subsequent regression analyses on OI patients confirmed significant relations between dynamic lung volumes and rib shape changes. Lower FVC and FEV1 values are identified in OI patients that present more horizontally aligned ribs, a greater antero-posterior depth due to extreme transverse curve at rib angles and a strong spine invagination, greater asymmetry, and a vertically short, thoraco-lumbar spine, which is relatively straight in at levels 1\u20138 and shows a marked kyphosis in the thoraco-lumbar transition.

The construction industry is exploring new opportunities involving biological processes and products to modify the structural properties of the in situ material, in terms of strength, volume stability, durability and permeability. Through an integrative interdisciplinary approach several microorganisms and other existing bio-enzymatic products such as secondary metabolites, enzymes, endospores, and extracellular polymeric substances have been considered as possible alternatives to conventional methods for the development of sustainable road infrastructure. Limitations in the current state of technology to developing bio-based solutions include microorganism selection and the ability to evaluate derivative components in rapid structural tests that enhance the time to development of proper commercial products. This study focused on the testing of fermentation derived components of biological materials in a high-throughput manner, using miniaturised structural tests to validate screening and selection methodology. The methods tested included resistance to abrasion, resistance to erosion, water absorption and resistance to compression load. Unique miniaturised test equipment was successfully developed using computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing technologies. Effects were measured to enable the rapid evaluation of a target microorganism and for screening of biological components or fractions. Results obtained using a Bacillus isolate reported in the current study exhibit strength characteristics and can potentially be formulated as a product for soil stabilisation.

In order to systematically study the tactile perception from finger friction to the brain response, a 32-channel Brain Products system and two tri-axial force sensors were used to obtain electroencephalograph (EEG) and friction signals during fingers exploring grating surfaces. A finite element finger model was established to analyze the stress changes of the skin receptors during tactile perception. Samples with different grating widths and spaces were chosen. The results indicated that different gratings induced different stress concentrations within skin that stimulated Meissner and Merkel receptors. Skin friction was affected by gratings during the tactile perception. It was also found that P300 evoked by gratings was related with the skin deformation, contact area, friction force, and stress around cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The wider grating width generated larger skin deformation, friction force, and stress, which induced stronger tactile stimulation. The smaller grating spacing generated higher vibration frequency, inducing stronger tactile stimulation. The latency of the P300 peak was related to the difference between the textured target stimulus and the smooth non-target stimulus. This study proofed that there was a relationship between the activation in brain regions, surface friction, and contact conditions of skin during the tactile perception. It contributes to understanding the formation process and cognitive mechanism of tactile perception of different surface textures.\n               ","1395":"\n                  In this work, numerical simulations of fluid flow around trash-rack for different bar cross sections are conducted to investigate cross section influence on head losses.

In previous experimental studies researchers mostly focused on trash-rack parameters (bar spacing, bar length, inclinations etc.) where bar cross section was mainly rectangular or streamlined shape. Therefore, 2D simulations for different cross sections are carried out for a range of trash-rack configurations in order to provide better insight how it affects energy losses. It is shown that head loss reduction due to change in cross section is greatly dependent on trash-rack configuration, therefore optimization of simplified real water turbine trash-rack is also conducted to produce the cross section that generates smallest head losses for given configuration.\n               ","1396":"\n                  Lately, long noncoding (lnc) RNAs are increasingly appreciated for their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Plasma levels of ApoA1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL17 were determined. The impact of these parameters on MS activity, relapse rate and patient disability was assessed. APOA1-AS, IFNG-AS1, SPHK1 & 2, and S1PR5 were upregulated in RRMS patients. Differences in ApoA1, SPHK2, and IL17 were observed between relapse and remission. Importantly, ApoA1, SPHK2, and IL17 were related to activity, while S1PR1 and IFN-\u03b3 were linked to disability, though, only IFN-\u03b3 was associated with relapse rate.

The proband was found to harbor a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation, c.1531G\u202f>\u202fT (p.G511C), in COL1A2 leading to OI and a heterozygous missense variant, c.364C\u202f>\u202fT (p.R122W), in LHX4. The LHX4 p.R122W has never been reported to cause CPHD. The variant was predicted to be deleterious and found in the highly conserved LIM2 domain of LHX4. The luciferase assays revealed that the p.R122W was unable to activate POU1F1, GH1, and TSHB promoters, validating its pathogenic effect in CPHD. Moreover, the variant did not alter the function of wild-type LHX4, indicating its hypomorphic pathomechanism. In conclusion, the novel de novo heterozygous p.G511C mutation in COL1A2 and the heterozygous pathogenic p.R122W mutation in LHX4 were demonstrated in a patient with OI and CPHD.

Overall, the results obtained are promising. They reveal the negligible propensity of AS-48 to cause cell death or impede cell growth at therapeutic concentrations (up to 27\u202f\u03bcM) and support the suitability of this peptide as a potential therapeutic agent against several microbial infections, due to its selectivity and potency at low concentrations (in the range of 0.3\u20138.9\u202f\u03bcM).

The results showed that most Pd formed Pd-rich intermetallic phases (IMPs) with a nearly continuous network while the bredigite phase was distributed at the grain boundaries. In addition, a large amount of much nobler IMPs formed micro-galvanic pairs with the Fe matrix, inducing tremendous micro-galvanic corrosion.

In conclusion, the current bioinformatic data and preliminary findings unravel that the predominant targets of curcumol against IC may be the potential biological markers for screening and treating IC, such as PTK2 molecule.\n               ","1547":"\n                  This paper presents a new generic approach for developing a Jacobian matrix for use with the optimization unit in real-time energy management systems (EMS) for unbalanced smart distribution systems. The proposed formulation can replace approximated calculations for real-time optimal power flow in an optimization unit while providing greater accuracy and requiring less computational time, which is critical for real-time EMS. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach have been tested through simulations with different distribution networks. The simulation results demonstrate a significant reduction in the computational time with the new proposed formulation. Moreover, the results demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach as the reduction in the computational time is more significant for large practical systems. The proposed approach is characterized by evaluating the scalability and low computational time; thus, it can be used by grid operators in real-time energy management applications for large-scale practical distribution systems.\n               ","1548":"\n                  A great number of patients have difficulty swallowing or needle fear. Therefore, buccal and orodispersible dosage forms (ODFs) represent an important strategy to enhance patient compliance. Besides not requiring water intake, swallowing or needles, these dosage forms allow drug release modulation. ODFs include oral lyophilizates or wafers, which present even faster disintegration than its compressed counterparts. Lyophilization can also produce buccal wafers that adhere to mucosa for sustained drug release. Due to the subject relevance and recent research growth, this review focused on oral lyophilizate production technology, formulation features, and therapy gains. It includes Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) and Critical Process Parameters (CPP) and discusses commercial and experimental examples. In sum, the available commercial products promote immediate drug release mainly based on biopolymeric matrixes and two production technologies. Therapy gains include substitution of traditional treatments depending on parenteral administration and patient preference over classical therapies. Experimental wafers show promising advantages as controlled release and drug enhanced stability. All compiled findings encourage the development of new wafers for several diseases and drug molecules.\n               ","1549":"\n                  With the rapid development of nanotechnology, the bio-barcode assay (BCA), as a new diagnostic tool, has been gradually applied to the detection of protein and nucleic acid targets and small-molecule compounds. BCA has the advantages of high sensitivity, short detection time, simple operation, low cost, good repeatability and good linear relationship between detection results. However, bio-barcode technology is not yet fully formed as a complete detection system, and the detection process in all aspects and stages is unstable. Therefore, studying the optimal reaction conditions, optimizing the experimental steps, exploring the multi-residue detection of small-molecule substances, and preparing immuno-bio-barcode kits are important research directions for the standardization and commercialization of BCA. The main theme of this review was to describe the principle of BCA, provide a comparison of its application, and introduce the single-residue and multi-residue detection of macromolecules and single-residue detection of small molecules. We also compared it with other detection methods, summarized its feasibility and limitations, expecting that with further improvement and development, the technique can be more widely used in the field of stable small-molecule and multi-residue detection.\n               ","1550":"\n                  The efficacy of gemcitabine therapy is often insufficient for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The current study demonstrated that LW6, a chemical inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1, is a promising drug for enhancing the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. LW6 monotherapy and the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine significantly inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced cell death in pancreatic cancer cells. This combination therapy also significantly reduced the tumor weight in a syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic carcinoma model without causing toxic side effects. In addition, this study provides insight into the mechanism of how LW6 interferes with the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer. The results revealed that LW6 inhibited autophagic flux, which is defined by the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and p62\/SQSTM1. Moreover, these results were verified by the analysis of a tandem RFP-GFP-tagged LC3 protein. Thence, for the first time, these data demonstrate that LW6 enhances the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine and inhibits autophagic flux. This suggests that the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine may be a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer patients.\n               ","1551":"\n                  Laparoscopy is widely recognized as a procedure of choice for gynaecological surgery. Myomectomy and hysterectomy are the most frequently performed surgical procedures in gynaecology. A morcellator is often used in myomectomies or subtotal hysterectomies, but morcellation may cause rare complications, such as parasitic iatrogenic myoma or adenomyoma. To improve patient counselling, proper risk estimation as well as risk factor identification should be acknowledged. This article aimed to review the literature on parasitic myoma and adenomyoma and to compare these diseases in terms of clinical, surgical, and prognostic factors. All published literature (case series and case reports) on iatrogenic myoma and adenomyoma was reviewed using PubMed\/MEDLINE and ScienceDirect resources. Despite both conditions having an iatrogenic origin, iatrogenic parasitic myoma and adenomyoma are two different entities in terms of clinical manifestations as well as intraoperative particularities, with a common point: iatrogenic complication. A possible solution to avoid these iatrogenic complications is by using in-bag morcellation or switching to another surgical procedure (e.g., a vaginal or abdominal approach). It is concluded that parasitic myoma and iatrogenic adenomyoma are two different iatrogenic morcellator-related complications. In patients with a history of uterus or myoma morcellation who report pelvic symptoms, iatrogenic parasitic myoma or adenomyoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n               ","1552":"","1553":"","1554":"","1555":"","1556":"","1557":"","1558":"","1559":"","1560":"","1561":"","1562":"","1563":"","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"","1567":"","1568":"","1569":"","1570":"","1571":"","1572":"","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"","1577":"","1578":"","1579":"","1580":"","1581":"","1582":"","1583":"","1584":"","1585":"","1586":"","1587":"","1588":"","1589":"","1590":"","1591":"","1592":"","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":"","1601":"","1602":"","1603":"","1604":"","1605":"","1606":"","1607":"","1608":"","1609":"","1610":"","1611":"","1612":"","1613":"","1614":"","1615":"","1616":"","1617":"","1618":"","1619":"","1620":"","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"","1631":"","1632":"","1633":"","1634":"","1635":"","1636":"","1637":"","1638":"","1639":"","1640":"","1641":"","1642":"","1643":"","1644":"","1645":"","1646":"","1647":"","1648":"","1649":"","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"","1656":"","1657":"","1658":"","1659":"","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"","1664":"","1665":"","1666":"","1667":"","1668":"","1669":"","1670":"","1671":"","1672":"","1673":"","1674":"","1675":"","1676":"","1677":"","1678":"","1679":"","1680":"","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"","1684":"","1685":"","1686":"","1687":"","1688":"\n                  Despite the great interest in using halophyte Salicornia europaea L. as a crop in extreme saline habitats, little is known about the role played by associated endophytic bacteria in increasing tolerance of the host-plant to nutrient deficiency. Main objectives of this study were to investigate the community composition of diazotrophic endophytes of S. europaea grown under natural conditions, and determine the proportion of plant-growth promoting bacterial strains able to fix N2. To quantify the abundance of diazotrophic bacterial endophytes in stems and roots of S. europaea, nifH gene and 16S rDNA copy numbers were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and characterized the taxonomic structure of cultivable bacteria based on selective medium for diazotrophs. The highest copy numbers of nifH and 16S rDNA were observed in the stems of plants growing at the test site characterized by lower salinity, and correlated with high N concentrations in plant tissues. The abundance of bacterial diazotrophs isolated from plant tissues ranged from 3.6 to 6.3 (log10 of cfu per gram dry plant tissue) and varied in a site- and plant-organ manner. Proteobacteria dominated in plants growing in lower salinity while Actinobacteria prevailed in plants originating from higher salinity, what suggest better adaptation of this group of bacteria to extreme salinity.

Among the molecular genetic methods, 16S-rRNA genes were of central importance to reconstruct the phylogeny of newly isolated bacteria and to localize them in situ. However, they usually do not allow resolution for phylogenetic affiliations below genus level. Especially, the separation of opportunistic human pathogens from plant beneficial strains, currently allocated to the same species, needs genome-based resolving techniques. Whole bacterial genome sequences allow to discriminate phylogenetically closely related strains. In addition, complete genome sequences enable strain-specific monitoring for biotechnologically relevant strains. In this mini-review we present high resolving approaches for analysis of the composition and key functions of plant microbiota, focusing on interactions of diazotrophic plant growth promoting bacteria, like Azospirillum brasilense, with non-legume host plants.

Both nanostructures enable their producer to kill other bacteria competing for the same ecological niche. Previously, type VI secretion systems and particularly R-type tailocins were considered highly specific, attacking a rather small range of competitors. Their specificity is conferred by cell surface receptors of the target bacterium and receptor-binding proteins on tailocin tail fibers and tail fiber-like appendages of T6SS. Since many R-type tailocin gene clusters contain only one tail fiber gene it was appropriate to expect small R-type tailocin target ranges. However, recently up to three tail fiber genes and broader target ranges have been reported for one plant-associated Pseudomonas strain. Here, we show that having three tail fiber genes per R-type tailocin gene cluster is a common feature of several strains of Gram-negative (often plant-associated) bacteria of the genus Kosakonia. Knowledge about the specificity of type VI secretion systems binding to target bacteria is even lower than in R-type tailocins. Although the mode of operation implicated specific binding, it was only published recently that type VI secretion systems develop tail fiber-like appendages. Here again Kosakonia, exhibiting up to three different type VI secretion systems, may provide valuable insights into the antagonistic potential of plant-associated bacteria. Current understanding of the diversity and potential of phage tail-like particles is fragmentary due to various synonyms and misleading terminology. Consistency in technical terms is a precondition for concerted and purposeful research, which precedes a comprehensive understanding of the specific interaction between bacteria producing phage tail-like particles and their targets.

In the present study, analysis of archaea-specific 16S rRNA gene fragments and shotgun-sequenced metagenomes was combined with visualization techniques to obtain the first insights into the archaeome of a common salad plant, arugula (Eruca sativa Mill.). The archaeal communities associated with the soil, rhizosphere and phyllosphere were distinct, but a high proportion of community members were shared among all analysed habitats. Soil habitats exhibited the highest diversity of Archaea, followed by the rhizosphere and the phyllosphere. The archaeal community was dominated by Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with the most abundant taxa assigned to Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus, species of the \u2018Soil Crenarchaeotic Group\u2019 and, interestingly, Methanosarcina. Moreover, a large number of archaea-assigned sequences remained unassigned at lower taxonomic levels. Overall, analysis of shotgun-sequenced total-community DNA revealed a more diverse archaeome. Differences were evident at the class level and at higher taxonomic resolutions when compared to results from the 16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon library. Functional assessments primarily revealed archaeal genes related to response to stress (especially oxidative stress), CO2 fixation, and glycogen degradation. Microscopic visualizations of fluorescently labelled archaea in the phyllosphere revealed small scattered colonies, while archaea in the rhizosphere were found to be embedded within large bacterial biofilms.

As well, the great success of culturomics of the human microbiota is considered with the main objective of encouraging microbiologists to continue minimizing the gap between the microbial richness in nature and the number of species in culture, for the benefit of both basic and applied microbiology.

Besides, the influence of cultivation conditions and osmotic stress within bacterial endophytes on their phosphate solubilising ability has not yet been addressed. By pre-conditioning cells with an osmoadaptation and a hydroxyectoine accumulation approach, this research aimed at enhancing the capability of the plant growth promoting bacterium Kosakonia radicincitans strain DSM 16656T to both solubilise phosphate and colonise plant seedlings. The results showed that halotolerant bacterial phenotypes increased the root-colonising capability by approximately 3-fold and presented growth-promoting effects in radish plants. Interestingly, findings also demonstrated that salt stress in the culture media along with the accumulation of hydroxyectoine led to an increase in the in vitro phosphate-solubilising ability by affecting the production of acid phosphatases, from 1.24 to 3.34\u202fU\u202fmg-1 for non-salt stressed cells and hydroxyectoine-added cells respectively.

Due to its simple sample preparation and short measurement time, MALDI-TOF MS is an excellent choice for the high-throughput study of microbial isolates from rhizospheres or plants grown under diverse environmental conditions. While clinical isolates have a higher identification rate than environmental isolates due to the focus of commercial mass spectral libraries on the former, no identification is necessary in the dereplication step of large environmental studies. The grouping of large sets of isolates according to their intact protein profiles can be performed without knowledge of their taxonomy. Thus, this method is easily applicable to environmental samples containing microorganisms from yet undescribed phylogenetic origins. The main strategies applied to achieve effective dereplication are, first, expanding existing mass spectral libraries and, second, using an additional statistical analysis step to group measured mass spectra and identify unique isolates.

Ecological processes such as dispersal, diversification, ecological drift, and selection as well as leaf surface physicochemistry and topology impact community assembly. Since the leaf surface is an oligotrophic environment, species interactions such as competition and cooperation may be major contributors to shape community structure. Furthermore, the plant immune system impacts on microbial community composition, as plant cells respond to bacterial molecules and shape their responses according to the mixture of molecules present. Such tunability of the plant immune network likely enables the plant host to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic colonisers, avoiding costly immune responses to non-pathogenic colonisers. Plant immune responses are either systemically distributed or locally confined, which in turn affects the colonisation pattern of the associated microbiota. However, how each of these factors impacts the bacterial community is unclear. To better understand this impact, bacterial communities need to be studied at a micrometre resolution, which is the scale that is relevant to the members of the community.

to the metabolic versatility and pharmic resistance, Staphylococcus aureus is well adapted in varied environments. Approximately 25\u201330% of healthy individuals are colonized by S. aureus on their skins and nasopharyngeal membranes, where S. aureus exists as a member of normal microbiota and does not cause infections on normal immune status [1]. However, S. aureus can cause a variety of serious infections upon invading the bloodstream or internal tissues. S. aureus is a leading human pathogen that causes a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from relatively benign skin and soft tissue infections to severe and life-threatening systemic diseases [2], and remains a challenging public health issue due to the emergence and dissemination of multidrug resistant strains, for example, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [1,3].\nMethicillin resistance is conferred by mecA or mecC gene, which is located on the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette, and encodes penicillin-binding protein 2A (PBP2A) or PBP2ALGA, the enzymes that are responsible for crosslinking the peptidoglycans of bacterial cell wall [4]. Both enzymes show a low affinity for \u03b2-lactams, thereby leading to resistance to this category of antibiotics [5,6]. Vancomycin has been one of the first line drugs to treat MRSA infections for decades [7\u20139]. However, the clinical isolates of S. aureus with intermediate and complete resistance to vancomycin have emerged within the past two decades [10,11], and have become a serious public health concern [12]. In this paper, we review the latest advances in the studies of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), including resistance mechanism, infection characteristics, and clinical treatments of VRSA infections.\n\n\nVancomycin discovery and action mechanism\nVancomycin is one of the oldest antibiotics, and has been in clinical use for nearly 60\u202fyears. Dr. Kornield, an organic chemist of Eli Lilly, isolated vancomycin from Streptomyces orientalis in the deep jungles of Borneo in 1957 [13]. Vancomycin is active against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci, Pneumococci, Listeria, Corynebacterium, and Clostridia. Currently, vancomycin is generally used for infections caused by MRSA and for the treatment of patients allergic to semisynthetic penicillin or cephalosporins [13].\nVancomycin exerts its bactericidal action via interrupting proper cell wall synthesis in the susceptible bacteria. Most bacterial membranes are coated with a cell wall structure that protects cells from swelling and bursting due to intracellular high osmolarity. During propagation, the cell wall structure including peptidoglycan needs to be enlarged. To do that, the precursor lipid II is added to the nascent peptidoglycan via transglycosylation and transpeptidation by the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (Fig. 1\na). The hydrophilic molecule of vancomycin can form hydrogen bond interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine (d-Ala\u2013d-Ala) moieties of the precursor lipid II. The binding of vancomycin leads to conformational alteration that prevents the incorporation of the precursor to the growing peptidoglycan chain and the subsequent transpeptidation, thereby leading to cell wall decomposition and bacterial lysis (Fig. 1b) [14]. However, the complex structure of vancomycin blocks its penetration through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and exerts limited bactericidal effect on Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n\nVancomycin resistance and mechanism in S. aureus\n\nThe isolates of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin are classified into three groups by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. These are vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) with MIC\u202f\u2264\u202f2\u202f\u03bcg\/ml, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) with MIC of 4\u20138\u202f\u03bcg\/ml, and VRSA with MIC\u202f\u2265\u202f16\u202f\u03bcg\/ml. In confirming whether an isolate belongs to VRSA, the presence of vanA or other van resistance determinants should be demonstrated by molecular methods [15].\n\nVISA\nIsolates of VISA, which are associated with hospitalization, persistent infection, prolongation, and\/or failure of vancomycin therapy, have been recovered worldwide [12]. VISA strains are generally believed to be initiated from heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA), which is defined as an S. aureus strain with a vancomycin MIC within the susceptible range (\u22642\u202f\u03bcg\/ml) determined by conventional methods, while a cell subpopulation is in the vancomycin-intermediate range (\u22654\u202f\u03bcg\/ml) [16,17].\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying VISA development are incompletely defined [14,18,19]. However, many efforts have been made to identify genetic determinants associated with vancomycin-intermediate resistance via comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics of VISA and its isogenic VSSA, and led to the identification of multiple mutations in genes responsible for VISA formation [14,20,21]. It is generally accepted that VISA is a result of the gradual mutation accumulation of the VISA-associated genes [22]. Of particular importance are the genes encoding two-component regulatory systems, such as WalKR [23\u201325], GraSR [26], and VraSR [14,26,27]. Although their genetic lineages varied, VISA strains generally display common phenotypes, including thickened cell wall, reduced autolytic activity, and decreased virulence [12]. The mechanism linking the diverse mutant genes to the VISA common phenotypes is unclear and should be investigated further.\n\n\nVRSA\nVancomycin became a therapeutic agent for the treatment of serious infections caused by MRSA in the late 1980\u202fs [28,29]. Almost at the same time, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were first identified in Europe [30\u201333], and quickly became endemic in hospital intensive care units. Vancomycin resistance in VRE was mediated by transposons mainly found on plasmids, which raised considerable concern about the risk of dissemination of vancomycin-resistant determinants to universally susceptible microorganisms of medical importance, especially S. aureus\n[33,34]. This concern was subsequently confirmed by the successful transfer of the van element from Enterococcus faecalis to a MRSA strain in mix-infected mice [35].\nIn 2002, the first VRSA strain was recovered in Michigan, USA [11,36]. In the same year, the second VRSA strain was isolated in Pennsylvania, USA [37]. Since then, a total of 52 VRSA strains carrying van genes have been reported (Table 1\n), including 14 isolated in USA [37\u201340], 16 in India [41\u201343], 11 in Iran [44\u201346], 9 in Pakistan [47,48], 1 in Brazil [49,50], and 1 in Portugal [51].\n\n\nMechanism underlying vancomycin resistance of VRSA\nVancomycin resistance in bacteria is mediated by van gene clusters that are found in pathogens (such as E. faecalis, E. faecium, S. aureus, and Clostridium difficile), glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes (such as Amycolotopsis orientalis, Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, and Streptomyces toyocaensis), anaerobic bacterium of the human bowel flora (such as Ruminococcus species), as well as a biopesticide Paenibacillus popilliae\n[52\u201356]\n. Vancomycin resistance is classified into several gene clusters based on the DNA sequence of the ligase van gene homologues that encode the key enzyme for the synthesis of d-alanyl\u2013d-lactate (d-Ala\u2013d-Lac) or d-alanyl\u2013d-serine (d-Ala\u2013d-Ser). At least 11 van gene clusters that confer vancomycin-resistance, responding for VanA, VanB, VanD, Van F, VanI, VanM, VanC, VanE, VanG, VanL, and VanN phenotypes, have been described to date [53,57\u201360]. The organization of these van clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The genes that encode d-Ala:d-Lac ligases, such as vanA, vanB, vanD, van F, vanI, and vanM, often result in high-level vancomycin resistance with MICs\u202f>\u202f256\u202fmg\/ml, while the genes that encode d-Ala:d-Ser ligases, including vanC, vanE, vanG, vanL, and vanN, generally result in low-level resistance with MICs of 8\u201316\u202fmg\/ml [61].\nAcquired vancomycin resistance is most prevalent among Enterococcus and is still rare in other pathogenic bacteria [15]. The vancomycin-resistant mechanism has been elucidated in Enterococcus species, which are also the main reservoir of acquired vancomycin resistance [15]. Although 11 van gene clusters have been discovered to confer vancomycin resistance, only the vanA gene cluster is responsible for the isolated VRSA strains [15].\nFive proteins encoded by the vanA gene cluster, VanS, VanR, VanH, VanA and VanX are essential for vancomycin resistance [62]. The original vanA gene cluster is carried in a transposon Tn1546 (Fig. 1c). VanS and VanR form a two-component system, and upregulate the expression of the cluster genes in the presence of vancomycin. VanH, VanA, and VanX modify the precursors from the native D-Ala-D-Ala to the resistant D-Ala-D-Lac. To do that, VanH serves as a dehydrogenase that reduces pyruvate to form d-Lac. VanX acts as a d,d-dipeptidase that hydrolyzes the native d-Ala\u2013d-Ala to prevent it being used in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. VanA ligates D-Lac to D-Ala to produce the resistant D-Ala-D-Lac, which replaces d-Ala\u2013d-Ala in the synthesis of peptidoglycan (Fig. 1d).\nAs above-mentioned, the action target of vancomycin is the terminal d-Ala\u2013d-Ala moieties of the precursor lipid II, with which vancomycin forms hydrogen bond interactions and prevent subsequent transglycosylation and transpeptidation. However, the modified d-Ala\u2013d-Lac leads to an almost 1000-fold decrease in affinity with vancomycin [63]. Therefore, vancomycin loses its bactericidal effect on strains with modified peptidoglycan precursor [15] (Fig. 1d).\nDeletion of any one of these Van components leads to recovery of vancomycin activity, making them promising targets for new drug development [64]. For example, hydroxyethylamines, posphinate and phosphonate transition-state analogues have been demonstrated to be inhibitors of VanA [65,66]. Phosphinate based, covalent inhibitors, and sulfur containing compounds have been explored to be inhibitors of VanX [67]. These inhibitors can be used in combination with vancomycin to prevent the decreased binding affinity of vancomycin with its target.\n\n\nCharacteristics of VRSA infections\nUp to date, there have been reports of 52 VRSA isolates with definite determination of the vanA gene via PCR assay. Their main characteristics are listed in supplementary Table S1. The analysis of these cases yielded the following common characteristics.\n\nCo-infection and co-colonization of VRE and MRSA Vancomycin resistance is achieved via the transfer of resistance determinants from a donor, usually VRE, to a recipient, usually MRSA. Therefore, co-infection and co-colonization of VRE with MRSA are common in clinical cases. In many cases, VRE strains were isolated along with VRSA (Table 1). VRE and MRSA co-infection and co-colonization are particularly common in the intensive care unit and long-term cared patients [68\u201371]. Indwelling device use, recent antibiotic use, diabetes, and open wounds are believed to predict the co-colonization situation [72\u201374].\n\nPrior use history of vancomycin In most cases, patients had a history of vancomycin use within three months prior to VRSA isolation. Vancomycin apparently serves as a selective pressure for drug resistance conferred by the vanA gene cluster.\n\nPrecursor diseases for VRSA infection Patients infected by VRSA generally suffered from several precursor diseases, including diabetes, end-stage renal failure, and gangrenous wound or surgical wound. Biofilms formed in wound or catheter facilitated the transfer of vancomycin-resistant plasmids from VRE to S. aureus\n[39].\n\nMajority of VRSA isolates belongs to clonal complex 5 (CC5) lineage The molecular types of most VRSA isolates with typing data are categorized to CC5 phylogenetic lineage. Notably, in 14 characterized US VRSAs, 13 strains belong to the CC5 lineage [75,76], which is the most prevalent clones causing hospital-associated infections in the Western Hemisphere [77]. The mechanisms underlying the predominant role of CC5 lineage in VRSA formation have not been determined to date.\n\nEffective antibiotic for VRSA Fortunately, VRSA isolates are susceptible to multiple antibiotics [78] (Table S1), which made antibacterial therapy an effective option in the clinical treatment of VRSA infections. Datomycin and linezolid are two commonly selected antibiotics for VRSA infection treatment (Table S1).\n\n\n\nTreatment of VRSA infections\nDue to the scarcity of the VRSA infection cases, no treatment guideline is currently available. Out of all reported VRSA cases, only a few provided detailed clinical data. According to these treatment experiences and CDC recommendations, the treatment of VRSA infections in general should include, but not be limited to the following.\n\nSystemic antimicrobial therapy\nExcept for vancomycin resistance, VRSA isolates commonly remain susceptible to multiple antimicrobial agents (Table S1). It was reported that >90% of 13 VRSA isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, daptomycin, linezolid, minocyline, tigecycline, rifampin, and trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole [78]. Therefore, a systemic antimicrobial therapy with effective antibiotics is generally implemented upon VRSA isolation determination by a clinical laboratory [29,36,79,80].\n\n\nWound care\nBacterial colonization is the first step in development of infections. As described in the previous section, co-infection and co-colonization of VRE and MRSA is favorable for the development of VRSA. Wound is the most common source of VRSA isolates and provides an environment for co-infection and co-colonization of MRSA and VRE. Therefore, aggressive wound care is generally implemented in the VRSA infection treatment (Table S1) [29,36,80]. Wound management not only contributes to the removal of VRSA but also blocks further possible plasmid delivery via eliminating the favorable environment for co-colonization.\n\n\nPrevention of hospital transmission\nHospital-acquired infections are commonly associated with high morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent hospital transmission, infection control precautions, including patient isolation, contact investigation, decolonization (when necessary), and prompt notification to infection control and local health authorities, should be initiated promptly upon VRSA determination in a laboratory [29,36,37]. Fortunately, no in-hospital communication has been reported so far.\nIn cases with detailed clinical data, clinical treatments were effective in part [36,79] but have failed in several cases due to the deterioration of the primary diseases [46,49,81]. Accumulation of more cases is necessary for recommendation of a treatment guideline for VRSA infections.\n\n\n\nWill VRSA be widespread in future?\nThe emergence of vancomycin resistance has ended the dominant status of vancomycin in the therapy of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Fortunately, the occurrence of VRSA infection remains rare. This phenomenon is prominent, especially in comparison with the rapid emergence and spread of vancomycin resistance in Enterococci. This phenomenon may be explained by a few possible reasons listed as following.\n\nRole of staphylococcal restrictive modification\nIn S. aureus cells, two restrictive modification systems, namely, SauI and type III-like restriction system, block horizontal gene transfer into S. aureus from other species and control the spread of resistant genes between the isolates of different S. aureus lineages [82,83].\n\n\nRestriction of vancomycin use\nPrior vancomycin treatment was involved in most cases of VRSA infection. The use of vancomycin is a risk factor for infection and colonization with VRE [84,85], and can increase the emergence of VRSA. Current controlled use of vancomycin (from the first line of antibiotics down to the final line of antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria) reduces the selection pressure of vancomycin resistance.\n\n\nLimitation of VRSA transmission in S. aureus\nIn most reported cases of VRSA infection, VRSA isolates arose from the independent transfer of the van gene cluster on a conjugative element from a VRE donor to a S. aureus recipient [75,86,87]. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations have been used to assess the risk for transmission of VRSA to other patients, healthcare workers, and close family members. No VRSA transmission has been observed to date, and the mechanism underlying this limitation is of interesting for further investigation.\n\n\nInstability of Tn1546 transposon carried plasmid in VRSA\nThe vancomycin-resistant phenotypes of several VRSA isolates are unstable. For example, an isolate designated as VRSA 595, which was recovered from a 63-year-old female patient at a long-term care facility in New York (US 3), reverted to a vancomycin-susceptible phenotype after two subcultures [39]. The VRSA isolate recovered in Pennsylvania (US 2) is genetically instable with a high rate of spontaneous loss of the vancomycin resistance determinant, thereby resulting in low-level vancomycin-resistant phenotype [88].\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n1.\nVancomycin has been an effective agent against the MRSA infections for decades. It is likely remains domination as long as resistance to vancomycin is under control, as well as new antibiotic with superior performance are not available.\n\n\n2.\nAlthough the case number of VRSA infection is limited, VRSA is still a potential threat to public health. Intensive surveillance of vancomycin-resistance, proper use of antibiotics, and adherence to infection control guidelines in health-care settings are essential for preventing emergence and dissemination of VRSA strains.\n\n\n3.\nThe identification and study of new resistant determinants are important for surveillance of vancomycin-resistance.\n\n\n4.\nThe modification of the terminal dipeptide moieties of the precursor lipid II is the main cause of failure of vancomycin action. Future research should focus on how to reverse the modification.\n\n\n5.\nMost patients with VRSA infection suffered from underlying diseases, vaccination for susceptible populations may be a feasible way to reduce the infections caused by S. aureus including VRSA.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\n","1391":"\n\nIntroduction\nOsteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare disease, occurring in 1 per 15,000 to 20,000 births and affecting 1 in every 200,000 individuals, presenting no gender or race predominance [1]. OI is a genetic disorder caused by a qualitative or quantitative defect of Type I collagen \u2013 the most abundant protein of the extracellular matrix of bone \u2013 mainly driven by autosomal dominant mutations in the genes that code for collagen Type I alpha chains COL1A1 and COL1A2 [2,3], although mutations in more than ten other genes can also lead to OI [3].\nThe phenotypic expression of OI was originally classified by Sillence et al. [4,5] into four clinical types: i.e. Type I, II, III, and IV. Each four clinical types have a different life expectancy, ranging from lethal (Type 2) to similar to the general population (Type I patients), being slightly reduced in Type IV and strongly decreased in Type III [6\u20138]. OI Type III is the most severe type among those patients who survive the first year of life, leading to a progressive and deforming evolution [9]. Additional types (up to nine types) have been described as knowledge about OI genetics has increased [10].\nPrevious studies have analyzed the clinical symptoms of OI patients using different methods, concluding that OI patients are characterized by bone fragility, frequent fractures, spine anomalies and rib cage deformities [3\u20135,11\u201317]. Nevertheless, it is not completely clear how these features affect the ventilatory mechanics of patients with this disease [7]; it is known, however, that respiratory disease is the principle cause of death in OI patients (81.6% of the deaths in OI Type III, 39% in the Type I and IV and 15.7% in the general population) [6]. The progressive chest deformities presented by OI patients tend to affect pulmonary function [14,17]. LoMauro et al. [14] studied the relationship between the progressive chest deformities and the pulmonary function and they suggested a direct relationship between the structural modifications of the rib cage and the pattern of volume variations during breathing in patients with severe OI. More specifically, these authors suggested that the deformation of the ribs was more important for respiratory function than scoliosis. More recently, LoMauro et al. [17] suggested that the combination of flattened vertebrae, floppy ribs, more horizontal ribs, spinal, and sternal deformity are the causes of the impaired expansion of pulmonary rib cage in severe OI.\nHowever, LoMauro et al. [14,17] analyzed the external chest wall only, while the complex morphology of the internal skeletal thoracic anatomy (i.e. ribs, vertebrae, etc.) is best approached through 3D geometric morphometrics on computed tomography (CT) data [18\u201321]. To our knowledge, there is not any work quantifying the anatomical relationship between the 3D morphology of the ribcage and the respiratory function. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to quantitatively test by means of 3D geometric morphometrics if rib shape changes in patients with severe OI are more relevant for respiratory function than thoracic spine shape, and to detect the anatomic configuration related to a worse respiratory function in OI patients.\n\n\nMethods\n\nStudy population\nAdult subjects with OI were recruited for this study on a voluntary basis after approval of the research protocol by the local Ethics Committee of the University of Valencia, Spain (approval n. H1417174744011). All OI patients were volunteers from the Fundaci\u00f3n AHUCE of Spain. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with OI [17], clinically classified as Type III and Type IV and confirmed by genetic testing. Patients with any other metabolic bone disease except OI and those who underwent surgery for correction of ribcage and\/or spinal deformities were excluded. All patients are currently receiving bisphosphonate therapy.\nAdditionally, as control group, sex-matched non-smoking healthy adults were selected from La Paz Hospital cohort (Madrid, Spain), recruited in previously published studies [19\u201322]. These subjects were free of any pulmonary or spinal pathology. The study was also approved by their institutional ethics committee (CEI Hospital Universitario La Paz; HULP-PI-513) and each participant gave written informed consent for the use of their medical data.\nThe final study population (Table 1\n) consisted of 12 patients with OI (7 females, 5 males; 9 Type III and 3 Type IV) and 12 control subjects (7 females, 5 males).\n\n\nPulmonary function tests\nSpirometry was performed on all subjects by trained clinicians in accordance with the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery guidelines [23] and equations of the Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 [24] were used as reference values. Individual measures of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1\u202fs (FEV1), expressed as absolute value and as percentage of predicted value, are shown in Table 2\n.\n\n\nCT protocol and imaging evaluation\nTwo CT scans per subject were carried out in a 15\u202fmin interval. The subjects were instructed to hold their breath in the maximal inspiration during the first scan and in the maximal expiration during the second one. The CT scans were post-processed to obtain multiplanar, maximum intensity projection and 3D reconstruction images [25]. Finally, the marching cubes algorithm was applied to obtain 3D virtual models of the ribcages [26].\n\n\n3D geometric morphometrics analysis and respiratory function\nGeometric morphometrics in 3D (3D GM) is defined as the statistical analysis of Cartesian landmark coordinates, which have both, biological meanings and homologous locations on the analysed anatomical structures [27\u201331]. This technique allows for the quantification of their geometric features and spatial relationships. Using Generalized Procrustes superimposition (GPA) of landmarks configurations [32], GM allows for a quantitative separation of size and 3D shape. Size is measured as centroid size (the summed squared distances between the centroid and each of the landmarks of a given configuration). Shape contains all features of the landmark configurations that are invariant to scale, position and orientation [27,31] and can be quantified through the Procrustes shape coordinates of landmark configurations after GPA. While centroid size is a 1-dimensional variable, shape is intrinsically multidimensional (3D shape coordinates) and requires multivariate statistics for its analysis [27,33]. Thus, the landmark configurations appear as points in a multivariate shape space and the distances between these points in shape space correspond directly to the distances between all the homologous landmarks after GPA \u2013 also known as Procrustes distances [28,34]. Therefore, any statistical analysis in GM can directly be visualized as thin-plate splines transformations of 3D landmark configurations for graphic interpretation [27,29].\nWe designed two templates of digitization to measure the rib cage and the thoracic spine morphology of the subjects composing our sample. The 24 virtual models were digitized using Viewbox 4 software (www.dhal.com). The template for the ribs was developed by Bastir et al. [18,20] and consists of 402 landmarks and curve semilandmarks distributed on ribs 1 to 10 (Fig. 1\n). Because CT-scanning was carried out to include the skeletal thorax to the level of the diaphragm, in many cases the 11th and 12th ribs were not available for measurement. In consequence, we only took landmark coordinates on the non-floating ribs [20,35]. The landmarks (140 in total) are located on the upper and lowermost parts of each rib head, on the most anterior part of the intraarticular crests, on the most lateral part of the tubercles, on the inferior part of the costal angles, on the upper and lowermost parts of each sternal rib end and on the superior and inferior parts of the manubrium. In addition, 13 curve semilandmarks were placed along the inferior shaft of each rib, which means a total of 260 semilandmarks.\nThe thoracic spine template was designed by Gonz\u00e1lez-Ruiz [36] and is composed of a total of 240 landmarks and curve semilandmarks distributed on the 12 thoracic vertebrae (Fig. 2\n). The landmarks (120 in total) are located on each vertebra on the most anterior part of the superior and inferior costal facets, the most lateral parts of both transverse processes, the most anterior part of the spinous process (superior view) where it meets the most posterior point of the vertebral foramen, the most posterior part of the spinous process and the most inferior and lateral part of both laminae. Also, five curve semilandmarks (120 in total) were placed along both the upper and lower margins of the intervertebral surfaces (on the annular epiphysis) of each vertebra.\nWhile landmarks are homologous points easily identifiable in all the specimens, semilandmarks are not anatomically homologous points and their localization in the specimens is uncertain [37,38]. In order to minimize this uncertainty in terms of their location when placing the semilandmarks along the curve, they were allowed to slide along tangent lines to their corresponding curves with respect to a reference configuration (template), as described by Gunz et al. [37]. By means of this sliding process, we find the optimal location for the semilandmarks (mathematical homology) with the morphometric difference (quantified as bending energy) between each specimen and the digitization template being minimal [37,38].\n\n\nData analysis\nFirst, Procrustes shape coordinates were analysed by means of Principal components analysis (PCA) [31]. This analysis does not allow the hypothesis to be tested statistically, but it is useful to explore overall patterns of biological shape variation in the OI sample.\nSecond, in order to explore the quantitative relationship between the rib cage and thoracic spine shape and the respiratory function of OI patients [14], and hence our hypothesis, we regressed our shape data (both of the spine and the ribcage separately) on the respiratory variables FVC, FEV1, FVC % predicted, and FEV1 % predicted [39]. These regressions were carried out from two different approaches: (1) we first carried out two PCA separately for the samples of the ribs and the thoracic spines in order to reduce the number of variables [31] and we regressed the resulting PC scores on respiratory function (FVC, FEV1, FVC % predicted, and FEV1 % predicted) in a statistical shape space (PCA tangent space) composed of a subset of PCs accounting for at least for 95% of total variance. (2) We secondly regressed Procrustes shape coordinates (3D shape data collecting rib deformations and scoliosis) on respiratory function (FVC, FEV1, FVC % predicted, and FEV1 % predicted) in full shape space (100% of total variance). These regression analyses were applied to the full sample consisting of the OI-patients and the control group and corrected for sexual dimorphism (pooled-within sex) and health condition (OI vs. control healthy sample). We corrected these differences because function is clearly related to sexual dimorphism [19,22,35] and we wanted to identify non-sex specific features related to mal-function. A final regression analysis of the OI sample only (pooled within sex) was applied to identify those anatomical features that lead to reduced respiratory capacities in OI-patients. Principal component analyses and regressions were performed in MorphoJ 1.06d [40], and all visualizations were produced using landmark-driven thin-plate spline transformations of 3D surface meshes by Evan toolkit (\nhttp:\/\/www.evan-society.org\/\n). Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range. Difference between groups was performed with the Mann-Whitney test. Two-sided p\u202f<\u202f0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.23 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\n\n\nResults\nResults of the principal component analyses of the ribs and the thoracic spine are shown in Tables 3\n and 4\n respectively. We found that the 95% of the total variance required to carry out the regression analyses on statistical shape space was yielded by 11 PCs in the rib sample and by 9 PCs in the spine sample. Subsequent regression analyses on the full sample (OI\u202f+\u202fcontrol subjects) showed a significant relation between rib shape and FEV1, FVC and FVC % pred (Table 5\n). On the contrary, no statistically significant relation was found between thoracic spine shape and FEV1, FEV1 % pred, FVC or FVC % pred on the full sample.\nResults of the principal component analysis of the thorax of the OI sample are shown in Figs. 3\n and 4\n. We can see, respectively, how OI-patients are distributed in shape space and the associated shape variations that reflect complex patterns of 3D rib-deformations (curvatures in the transversal planes) and variations in the declination both in sagittal and coronal planes of the thoracic cage, which also generates scoliosis and kyphosis.\nSubsequent regression analyses on OI patients confirmed significant relations between ribs and respiratory function (Fig. 5\nA, Table 6\n), with Fig. 5B and C showing the associated shape changes. Thus, lower FEV1 and FVC values are observed in OI patients (males and females) with more horizontally aligned ribs, a greater antero-posterior depth due to extreme transverse curve at rib angles and a strong spine invagination, greater asymmetry, and a vertically shorter, thoraco-lumbar spine, which is relatively straight at levels 1\u20138 and shows a marked kyphosis in the thoraco-lumbar transition.\n\n\nDiscussion\nHere we present the first 3D geometric morphometrics study of the thorax of OI patients. The correlation between impaired respiratory function and thoracic spine deformity in OI has been previously investigated. Widmann et al. [41] demonstrated a correlation between pulmonary function variables and the scoliosis angle but did not find any correlation between kyphosis, chest wall deformities and FVC, while Wekre et al. [42] demonstrated correlations between spirometry indexes corrected with arm span height and spinal deformities reflected in spine deformity index. In this context, Norimatsu et al. [43] suggested that respiratory dysfunction may be secondary to progressive spinal deformity based on serial pulmonary function testing in five patients with OI and a 14-year follow-up of FVC. On the other side, Falvo et al. [44] concluded that there are no significant differences in the results of pulmonary function testing in patients with OI and associated kyphoscoliosis and the general population with kyphoscoliosis without OI.\nIn addition, Lo Mauro et al. [14] noted that patients with severe OI are characterized by pectus carinatum and it has been postulated that this altered geometry causes considerable consequences in terms of volume variations of the chest wall compartments during breathing, since the deformed ribcage alters the normal action of the intercostal muscles and requires the diaphragm to compensate for the reduced contribution to tidal volume. However, rather than the chest wall, we have analyzed the skeletal thorax of OI patients by means of 3D geometric morphometrics. Our regression analyses showed a significant relationship between ribs shape and FEV1, FVC and FVC % pred, and no statistically significant relation between thoracic spine shape and FEV1, FVC, FEV1 % pred, and FVC % pred; as a consequence, our results support the hypothesis that ribs are more relevant for respiratory function in OI patients than the scoliosis, as suggested by Lo Mauro et al. [14].\nThe FVC denomination as vital capacity is not capricious [45]. In fact, it is well known that reduced levels of ventilatory function, measured as FVC or FEV1, are associated with higher all-cause mortality rates, and therefore shorter survival in the general population [45\u201347]. Both for all-cause mortality and more specifically for circulatory disease mortality, FVC and FEV1 are as strongly predictive as body mass index and more strongly predictive than systolic blood pressure, even among lifelong non-smokers [46]. Although no specific information about the prognostic value of spirometric measurements in patients with OI is available, pulmonary complications are a significant cause for morbidity and mortality in these patients. Moreover, in a large cohort of individuals with OI enrolled in a multicenter, observational study, patients with more severe disease had lowest values of FVC and FEV1 [48]. These findings are compatible with a restrictive ventilatory disorder, which induces chronic respiratory symptoms and results in severe thoracic insufficiency syndrome and early death [49]. In turn, other circumstances have been implicated in the mortality excess reported in patients with a restrictive disorder, such as a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, systemic inflammation and diabetes, among other [45].\nAs related before, different researchers have analyzed the influence of spine, ribs and morphology of the thorax (i.e. pectus carinatum) of OI patients on respiratory function but, to our knowledge, our study is the first one to present the complete internal skeletal anatomy as a whole (ribs, spine and their deformities) and reveals the relationship between rib shape and respiratory function. In this context, our results showed that worse respiratory function in OI patients is related to an anatomic configuration characterized by more horizontally aligned ribs, a greater antero-posterior depth due to extreme transverse curve at rib angles and a strong spine invagination, greater asymmetry, and a vertically short, thoraco-lumbar spine, which is relatively straight in the superior part and shows a marked kyphosis in the thoraco-lumbar transition being scoliosis less evident in this 3D geometric morphometrics model. Further research by means of magnetic resonance imaging may be needed in order to analyze the possible shape changes of the intercostal muscles as a consequence of the related rib cage deformities we found.\nResults obtained on the anatomic OI model are of special importance as OI is a progressive disease. Our results suggest that OI patients need early therapeutic actions in order to retard and\/or avoid the appearance of the thorax deformities we described (Fig. 5), because subjects with severe OI present, since childhood, a rapid and shallow breathing pattern characterized by significantly higher breathing frequency [17], being the respiratory complication the main cause of death in OI also during childhood [6\u20138]. In this context, many studies have found that bisphosphonate therapy for children with OI, when started early in life, leads to increased bone density, decreased fracture rate, recovery of the shape of vertebral bodies [50,51] and preservation of vertebral shape [52]. Published data suggest that bisphosphonate treatment decreases the rate of progression of scoliosis in children with OI when therapy starts before the age of six years [53], but does not modify the prevalence of moderate to severe scoliosis at maturity [54]. It should be noted that all our patients were in treatment with bisphosphonates. Together with this, Lo Mauro et al. [17] suggested that specific physiotherapy targeted to the rib cage muscles may be started in early childhood in severe OI to try to delay or reduce the effects of the progressively reduced action of these muscles. Furthermore, we suggest to combine the physiotherapy targeted to the ribcage muscles proposed by Lo Mauro et al. [17] with specific surgery and specific orthopedic care [55] in order to avoid the appearance of the rib cage deformities we present. Finally, we want to highlight the potential clinical implication of our results. The identification that alterations in the ventilatory mechanics of patients with OI is more depend on rib cage dynamics than on the dorsal spine raises the possibility of developing therapeutic interventions aimed to promote thoracic cage mobility, which a priori it is more feasible than modify the structure of vertebral bodies\nOur study presents some limitations: firstly, the relatively low number of patients. It should be taken into consideration here that OI has been classified as a rare disease. In addition, our study was carried out by means of CT scans, with its associated radiation exposure. Nevertheless, participation of all OI subjects was voluntary after being advised about the radiation exposure and CT studies were carried out in order to control the skeletal basis of the evolution of their disease.\n\n\nConclusions\nTherefore, despite the above-mentioned limitations, we consider the results of this translational study may have important consequences on future clinical functional evaluation and should be completed by further studies that include a larger number of patients. We also believe the results presented here will serve for a better management of OI patients that may include a new clinical approach based on control, avoiding and correction of the thorax deformities for obtaining a better respiratory function in these patients. Also, further research will be necessary in order to compare the pulmonary function of OI patients after correction of their thorax deformities.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.\n\n","1392":"\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the emerging concepts from mathematical photonics is \u201ccubic-quartic (CQ) solitons\u201d [1\u20137,9,10]. This appears when group velocity dispersion (GVD) runs low and hence discarded. This was first introduced a couple of years ago as a follow-up to the concept of \u201cquartic solitons\u201d which was a prequel paper to the first paper on CQ solitons [8]. It is noted that quartic solitons cannot be analytically studied and therefore one must remain contended with numerical solutions only. In order to understand the behavior of solitons in absence of GVD the concept of CQ solitons was subsequently introduced. Later spectrums of results have started pouring in with CQ solitons.\nWhile all of the works thus far on CQ solitons are analytical in character, it now time to take a fresher look at such solitons from a numerical perspective. The current paper thus addresses CQ solitons from a numerical standpoint. The algorithm that displays the results is an improved version of Adomian decomposition method (IADM) scheme. The focus is on power law nonlinearity refractive index. The details of the scheme are inked and the results are displayed in the upcoming sections.\n\nThe model\nThe cubic-quartic (CQ) NLSE including third and fourth order dispersion but without GVD is given by [1]:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\niq\n\n\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\niaq\n\n\nxxx\n\n\n+\n\n\nbq\n\n\nxxxx\n\n\n+\nc\n\u2223\nq\n\n\n\u2223\n\n\n2\nm\n\n\nq\n=\n0\n,\n\nm\n\u2208\nN\n.\n\n\n\nHere, in Eq.

Besides a and b respectively represent coefficients of third and fourth order dispersions. Finally c is the coefficient of power law of refractive index where m stands for the power law factor.\nExact analytical bright and singular soliton solutions for the CQ model (1) were recently obtained in [1] with the help the of the undetermined coefficients method and before in [8] pure-quartic solitons propagation was studied.\n\n\nCubic-quartic bright optical solitons\nThe bright CQ 1-soliton solution to (1) was found by the authors in [1] and is given by\n\n(2)\n\n\nq\n(\nx\n,\nt\n)\n=\nA\n\n\nsech\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n[\nB\n(\nx\n-\n\u03bd\nt\n)\n]\n\n\ne\n\n\ni\n[\n-\n\u03ba\nx\n+\n\u03c9\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n0\n\n\n]\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq.

M. Wazwaz first in [11] and shortly after the modification was improved in [12] by A. M. Wazwaz and S. M. El-Sayed. This improvement to the Adomian decomposition method was established based on the assumption that the initial condition can be decomposed into a series of functions in the spatial variable.

The numerical results speak for itself with the display of impressive profiles for bright solitons. The results of the scheme thus pave way for future results. They will stem from CQ solitons from birefringent fibers having various nonlinear structures. Further along, the results will be extended to the model with DWDM networks. Those results will be available shortly down the road. Therefore those knowledge-hungry folks are suggested to hold it with patience!.\n\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare they have no conflict of interest.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1393":"\n\nIntroduction\nIncreasing demand is placed on the design, construction and maintenance of road infrastructure, especially in developing countries that often have limited resources due to a constrained fiscus. An additional concern is the associated negative environmental impact of traditional cementitious additives opposite the preservation of scarce natural resources [1]. Material sourcing is one of the contributing factors to increased costs of construction, due to hauling distances, when local materials cannot be used. Stabilisation of in situ material is considered to be important for improving the strength and performance of the treated soil material, which contributes to prolonging the service life of the subgrade and a more economical design [2]. Therefore, innovation is required in the use of alternative materials and innovative construction techniques that enhance in situ materials and minimise environmental load. Biological stabilising additives such as secondary metabolites, enzymes, endospores, and extracellular polymeric substances have been shown to enhance strength and durability characteristics of soils, in addition to having the advantage of a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional stabilisers [3]. Research using Bacillus species has resulted in the identification of potential strains for these civil engineering applications, such as Bacillus pasteurii\n[4]. However limited knowledge is available on the application of bio-stabilisers in road construction, therefore a need has been identified for the development of new experimental techniques for the purpose of evaluation and selection of microbes and microbial components representative of whole broth, vegetative cells, spores, enzymes and biopolymers in a high-throughput screening process.\nIn accordance with civil engineering material specifications and test standards, the ability to measure the resistance to abrasion, resistance to erosion, resistance to compressive stress and water absorption of hardened soil allows simultaneous evaluation of strength properties [5,6]. When the in-place soil does not meet the desired or required strength or other properties, stabilising the low quality materials to meet the desired performance criteria is needed. The traditional approach in testing and assessment involves subjecting a material to controlled large scale strength testing such as abrasion resistance, erosion resistance, moisture sensitivity, California bearing ratio (CBR) and\/or unconfined compression strength test (UCS) whilst monitoring bulk mass loss or dimensional changes [7]. Considering the number of tests, the development of potential biological soil stabilisers would require multiple samples. Therefore, rapid screening of new biological stabilisers using standard size cylindrical blocks is limited due to the higher resources required to test multiple samples. Some studies on biological stabilisers include those reported by Ghosh, Mandal [8], Rao, Reddy [9] and Charpe, Latkar [10] that only showed bacteria impregnation improvement through compressive strength testing. More studies are necessary to complement the existing information on the performance of microbial based, enzyme, polymeric or ionic stabilisers in order to establish an acceptable standard for use of these alternatives in the road construction sector.\nLimited miniaturised testing is available to enable the medium to high-throughput screening and evaluation of multiple biological stabilisation materials to reduce cost and enable technological advancement [11]. This has created a need for the development of novel miniaturised testing equipment and methodology, based on the larger scale tests, to evaluate the structural enhancement resulting from the addition of biological stabilisers to actual aggregate material used in the construction industry.\nOur research details the development of small bench-scale (miniaturised) testing equipment (produced through 3D printing) and the associated testing procedures, followed by the statistical evaluation of the suitability of the tests to measure the criteria of interest regarding structural stabilisation of in situ material. The choice of introducing small scale testing to enable high-throughput screening is reflected in the fact that the effectiveness in bonding is dependent on the interaction of the bio-additive with fines in the bulk material. A correct interpretation and detailed analysis of the effects produced by the bio-additive on the bonding effectiveness using small scale testing should contribute to the overall understanding of the binding effectiveness of the bio-additive and allowing for conservation of materials for testing during the screening process. Results were also compared to the associated full scale standardised tests as part of the validation of these bench-scale methods. This paper outlines the bench-scale test methodology that can be used for the prediction of structural performance thereby enabling higher throughput screening and selection of microbes and microbial components for further development.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nPreparation of crude additives for soil stabilisation\nA cryo-preserved culture of B. licheniformis was used for the study (the Netherlands Culture Collection of Bacteria, NCCB 100133) [12]. The inoculum was prepared by adding a cryovial containing this isolate (2\u202fmL stored at \u2013 80\u202f\u00b0C in an ultra-freezer (Forma\u2122 88,000 Series, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, USA)) to 700\u202fmL sterile Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB) and incubated at 32\u202f\u00b0C on a platform rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Innova 2300 series, New Jersey, USA) at 180 RPM for 13\u202fh until an optical density (OD), measured at 660\u202fnm (Spectroquant Pharo 300, Merck, Gauteng, South Africa), of between 4 and 5 was obtained. The inoculum flask was used to inoculate a 10 L bioreactor containing culture medium (protein source 29.49\u202fg.L-1, carbon source 51.33\u202fg.L-1 and salts ((NH4)2SO4, Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O, MgSO4\u00b77H2O, MnSO4\u00b74H2O and FeSO4\u00b77H2O ranging from 0.03 to 5.00\u202fg.L-1 respectively) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The fermentation was carried out in a 10 L Biostat Braun C reactor (Sartorius BBI Systems, Melsungen, Germany). Temperature was controlled at 32\u202f\u00b0C, agitator and airflow ramped from 500 to 1300 RPM and 10 to 20 SLPM over six hours respectively. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was monitored during the course of the cultivation to ensure oxygen sufficiency whilst pressure was maintained at 500 mBar. The pH was set at 6.80 and controlled using 10% v.v-1 H2SO4 or 30% v.v-1 NH4OH.\nOnce the culture reached the stationary phase at\u202f~\u202f12:00 \u2013 20:00\u202fh\u2019s fermentation age, the whole broth was recovered and stored in sterile containers at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh. This whole broth was termed Fraction A for use in the subsequent test experiments and added as a bio-additive at a concentration of 0.025 L\/kg of soil [2].\n\n\nPreparation of miniature test blocks\nTwo different types of soils denoted as soil type I (dolerite soil) and II (weathered granite) were retrieved from specific sites in South Africa (SA) (Table S1-S2; Fig. S1-S2). Soil samples used for the tests, are those classified to be of good quality for use in road construction and collected at depth from borrow pits, to avoid the presence of organic matter. The bio-additive mixtures and each of the soil types listed above were mixed using 25\u202fg of bio-additive (Fraction A) and 55\u202fg deionised water per 1000\u202fg soil material (at a bio-additive concentration of 2.5% i.e. the mass of Fraction A as a proportion to the mass of soil). The soil\/bio-additive mix was left to mellow for 12\u202fh at room temperature. The optimum moisture content (OMC) was determined by conducting the density-moisture content test (South African National Standard test SANS 3001-GR30:2015 Determination of the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content) (Table S3; Fig. S3). The moisture content (\u00b18%) (Tables S1\u2013S2) was confirmed at lab scale using a moisture analyzer (Moisture analyzer, HS153, Mettler Toledo, Ohio, USA) for integration of the bio-additives mix to the soils to achieve uniformity during compaction. The studies also included a positive control (soil treated with a Permazyme product (Specialised Protection Products, Gauteng, South Africa) prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; a negative control (untreated soil wetted with water). A test standard (Ordinary Portland cement, OPC) (Pretoria PortlandCement, Gauteng, South Africa) 0.3 to water was prepared by mixing 100\u202fg of OPC with 30\u202fg of deionised water and similarly mixed into the soil. All formats were then fully compressed manually using a tablet press (Korsch, Berlin, Germany) to produce miniature compacted blocks with dimension of 9\u202fmm height\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202fmm diameter. The soil blocks were cured in a 25\u202f\u00b0C incubator for 7\u202fdays at a relative humidity between 50 and 60%, and the OPC blocks cured at 21\u202f\u00b0C for 7\u202fdays, immersed in water. After 7\u202fdays, the compaction diameter and height of the blocks were checked for uniformity using a digital caliper of each treated and untreated soil block.\n\n\n\nDesign of the apparatus\n\nAbrasion test \u2013 Fabrication\nThe brush test is one of several strength tests that are carried out to assess the material\u2019s durability and resistance to abrasion, simulating harsh shearing forces exerted on road wearing courses in field studies [13]. The miniaturised device was designed using CAD software (SolidWorks, USA) and printed using a Wanhao Duplicator 4S running Sailfish firmware (Slic3r Prusa Edition software). The block holder was designed to accommodate the miniaturised blocks (in terms of size, compaction and soil materials) and the rotating case was printed as two separate components, the interlocking mechanism allows for easy removal of the holding case. The fixed base of the rotating case and the base of the brush was printed using PETG filament (3D printing factory, Centurion, South Africa). Aluminium (Micro Robotics, Centurion, South Africa) was used for the fixed arm, adjustable load arm and base stand of the apparatus. The rollers provide a downward mechanism that minimised frictional force. The load serves as a constant force calculated at 3.3\u202fN against the block, to ensure abrasion occurs consistently as the test block wears over time. Due to the scaling down of the sample a fixed load and rotating holding case set at 115 RPM and was sufficient to test abrasion in relation to the standard of the larger scaled test [5]. The apparatus was connected with Arduino UNO R3 (UNOR3), power supply 12\u202fV 2A (12V2A) and DC worm gear motor \u2212 12\u202fV 160 RPM (JGY-370-12V-160) (Micro Robotics, Centurion, South Africa) (Fig. 1\na \u2013 g). The nylon bristle brush placed above the surface of the bio-stabilised block gradually removed material (at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20\u202fmin intervals) which allowed for assessment of the material\u2019s durability and resistance to abrasion over time. On the basis of preliminary testing, the brush was changed every 100 cycles to avoid discrepancies due to wearing of the brushes.\n\n\nErosion test \u2013 Fabrication\nThe erosion test is one of several strength tests that are carried out to assess the material's resistance to running water, simulating rainy and humid weather conditions for field studies [6,7]. Earth and gravel roads are vulnerable to weather, especially during rainy seasons as soil material can lose cohesiveness, such as fine material possessing a higher permeability [14]. Therefore, the use of bio-stabilisers to prevent erosion due to water action needs to be investigated. The erosion test was designed using CAD software (SolidWorks, USA) and Wanhao Duplicator 4S running Sailfish firmware (Slic3r Prusa Edition software to generate the gcode) for printing, similar to the abrasion test. The holding block (45\u00b0flow angle) was designed to accommodate the miniaturised blocks (in terms of size, compaction and soil materials) such that they could be secured without damage and was printed using PETG filament (3D printing factory, Centurion, South Africa). A port was inserted for a 5\u202fmm drain pipe (to allow excess water to drain off) and a notch to mount the dripper line using silicone tubing (3\u202fmm diameter) for the flow of water. Since the water pressure used would be relatively low (simulating water surface flow not water impact) a needle was insert and orientated such that it was in line with the uppermost surface of the bio-stabilised block thus allowing for even distribution of deionised water over a prepared block. A filling tank and pump system was fitted to allow a constant flow rate of 2.5\u202fmL\/min at all times. The optimum duration of water flow was assessed to finalise the test method. The test blocks were tested at two minutes interval and provided sufficient time to distinguish erodibility of different soils and the effectiveness of the potential stabilisers [6].\n\n\nWater absorption test\nThis test provides a modified model of the capillary rise process [15]. Chemically\/biochemically stabilised material on unsurfaced roads should have adequate compressive strength under dry conditions; however, the material will lose strength under adverse moisture content. The amount of water absorption permitted by the stabilised soil is therefore of importance in this case. A water absorption test method can provide a basis for analysis of test data for characterisation, such as the water absorption coefficient (Aw) (indicating water absorbent properties of the material), and the point at which material deforms (amount of water absorbed before failure) thus showing the effect of moisture migration on the cohesion of the soil material. Modification of the capillary absorption rate data was obtained using the standard procedure [15] whereby the cylindrical test blocks of 9\u202fmm height\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202fmm diameter were placed in contact with the test liquid (deionised water) in a shallow graduated tray (2\u202fmm depth of immersion). Water was absorbed through the bottom face. The weight gain of the sample was measured at 1\u202fmin intervals over a period of 6\u202fmin or until the water level mark reached the top of the block. This was noted by observing the sample wetness.\n\n\nCompressive strength test\nThe compression load test is one of several strength tests that are carried out to assess the material's resistance to compressive forces. Compression testing determines the compressive strength parameters which will be used to assess the suitability of the mixture for use in pavement bases and sub-bases, stabilised subgrades and structural fills. A tablet press (Korsch, Berlin, Germany) was used to assess the breakage point. The equipment consisted of a lower punch piston and an upper punch piston; a uniform force was exerted on the block until breakage point. The breakpoint force was recorded in KN and converted to compressive stress in mega Pascal\u2019s (MPa) (Pharma-Research software, Berlin, Germany). Deformation was not measured as the current focus is on maximum achievable strength and not deformation characteristics.\n\n\nDevelopment of test methodology\nThe verification of methods is described in Table 1\n according to the thresholds that were defined [5,6]. Following this approach provided an increased level of confidence in the test results. The following tests were defined to measure the structural performance of the bio-additive mixtures: The abrasion test (1), measured the resistance to abrasion, simulating constant wear or gradual loss of material on the bio-stabilised blocks in a uniform manner over time (Equation (1)).\n\n(1)\n\n\nMa\n=\n\n\nMi\n-\nM\nf\n\n\nMi\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\nWhere,\n\nMa\u202f=\u202fPercentage of material abraded,\n\n\nMi\u202f=\u202fInitial mass of block,\n\n\nMf\u202f=\u202fFinal mass of block.\n\n\n\nThe erosion test (2), measured the resistance to erosion, simulating a flow of water and hence gradual loss of material over a set time (Equation (2)).\n\n(2)\n\n\nWm\n=\n\n\nWw\n-\nW\nd\n\n\nWw\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n\n\n\nWhere,\n\nWm\u202f=\u202fPercentage loss due to erosion,\n\n\nWw\u202f=\u202fWeight of block before testing,\n\n\nWd\u202f=\u202fWeight of block after drying.\n\n\n\nThe water absorption test (3) was a modification of a validated test method and measured the resistance to water absorption using miniaturised bio-stabilised soil as well as the effect of hydration i.e. the point deformation of the bio-stabilised soil (Equation (3) and (4)).\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u0394\n\nM\nt\n\n=\n\nM\nt\n\n-\n\nM\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nm\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\nM\n\nt\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nWhere,\n\nM0 (g)\u202f=\u202fDry weight of the specimen at time (t)\u202f=\u202f0,\n\n\nMt (g)\u202f=\u202fWeight of the specimen at time t,\n\n\n\u0394Mt (g)\u202f=\u202fWeight of absorbed water after time (t),\n\n\nm (kg\u00b7m\u22122)\u202f=\u202fWeight of absorbed water per unit area,\n\n\nd (mm)\u202f=\u202fDiameter of the specimen.\n\n\n\nThe resistance to compression (4) was a modification of validated test equipment, utilising set specifications of the miniaturised bio-stabilised blocks, and the stress required to breakage point describes this test (compressive stress in MPa). Ordinary Portland cement was used as the test reference material for the above mentioned tests. These methods (1\u20134) provide a rapid screening of the biological fractions to provide a basis for selection for subsequent larger scale testing by assessing the observed changes in performance as a function of level of treatment.\n\n\nLarge scale tests\nThe study used soil type II (weathered granite) for the preliminary assessment in order to validate the test methodology. The water ratio normalisation in the analysis was determined (MDD\/OMC) (Table S3, Fig. S3) as the Broth mixture required (absorbed) more water to achieve uniformity during compaction (cylindrical block samples, 100\u202fmm diameter & 115\u202fmm height). Standard erosion and abrasion tests [16] were used as an indication of the stabilised soil properties.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nResults were expressed as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fS.E.M. Univariate analysis of variance was carried out and the statistical comparisons were done with the Bonferroni test and t-test using a statistical package program (GraphPad Prism\u00ae 5.03 software for Windows).\n\n\n\nResults\n\nTest methodology\nThe test methodology was successfully verified as shown in Table 1 which shows that the results were within close proximity to the defined thresholds using soil type I and II (Tables S4\u2013S9). Table 2\n summarises the descriptions of each test and the measurements taken.\n\n\nMiniaturisation of bio-stabilised blocks\nMiniaturised blocks were successfully produced using the selected soils. Fig. 1 (h and i) illustrates soil I and soil II blocks that enabled method screening on different soil types. Due to the vast differences in soil types only two soils were selected for testing; a clayey soil (soil type I, dolerite soil) and a non-plastic soil or varying course fraction (soil type II, weathered granite).\n\n\nMiniaturisation of test equipment\nMiniaturised test equipment was successfully designed for the brush and erosion tests via CAD and fabricated into detailed engineered 3D models (Table 3\n). The equipment was successfully functionalised.\n\n\nAbrasion analysis\nThe blocks were analysed by determining net weight lost for a specific time period (g\/min), the weight of the block before and after the test was recorded using Equation (1) (Fig. S4). The percentage loss of material for standard ordinary Portland cement was shown as relative loss (Tables S10 and S11). From the results the positive and negative controls performed as expected and enabled comparisons to the biological fractions that were tested (Fig. 2\n). Data from here was used as an input for the design of experiments for large scale testing.\n\n\nErosion analysis\nErosion properties of the material were measured by determining the net weight loss of the blocks (Equation (2)). The material\u2019s erosion properties are shown over a two minute time period. The assessment of erosion properties was calculated relative to the test standard, the fractions displayed significant differences compared to the negative and positive controls (e.g. Table S12). This test was found to simulate erosion loss due to the flow of water over the surface of the compacted soil blocks, which satisfied the requirements for this test. A graphical summary of the erosion test results is shown in Fig. 3\n. The results clearly show as expected, that the addition of stabilising additives (positive control) increased the effect on erosion resistance.\n\n\nWater absorption analysis\nWater repellent agents are considered an effective measure of preventing moisture damage in construction materials. Water absorption coefficient (Aw) expresses the rate of capillary action in a certain time (Aw (kg m\u22122\u00b7s\u22121\/2)). The slope (m) was calculated from the weight of absorbed water per area (kg\u00b7m\u22122) versus the square root of time (s). The positive and negative controls were used to determine the Aw, and indicate that the higher the water absorption coefficient, the lower the water repellent properties of the material. For the determination of the water absorption coefficient refer to Equations (3) and (4) (Fig. S5). No inconsistencies were observed in the data, as both the positive and negative controls performed as expected (Fig. 4\n). The second response measured the point of deformation of the bio-stabilised blocks using time as a variable. This indicates the cohesive properties of the particles started to fail at a particular point and onwards (Fig. S6).\n\n\nCompression load analysis\n\nFig. 5\n shows the compression breakage point of soil types I and II, the sample size was modified from N\u202f=\u202f3 to N\u202f=\u202f6 so that outliers could be eliminated (Q\u202f=\u202f1) and thus follows a non-linear fit using a second order polynomial (quadratic). The test control result was >75\u202fMPa showing a greater force was required to break the miniaturised concrete block. Descriptive statistics were outlined, showing the results of the method and performance of the biological fractions. The addition of biological components and fractions extracted from a B. licheniformis fermentation at vegetative state to soil type I and II displayed increased resistance to compression against the Permazyme product (positive control) and in comparison, to the untreated soil material (negative control) (Fig. S7; Tables S13\u2013S14).\n\n\nLarge scale testing\nStandardised methods were performed using similar test parameters on soil type II, to demonstrate that the miniaturised assay test results are valid and consistent with those at large scale [16]. The results show the resistance to abrasion and resistance to erosion at large scale (Fig. 6\n). The tests utilise loss of material as a primary measure in both methods. From the statistical comparison Table 4\n shows the small scale tests (method A) and the large scale tests (method B), as well as the mean values obtained for the positive and negative controls at small scale versus large scale. Comparison of results at small scale versus large scale testing enables the prediction of technical requirements for large scale testing such as improvement of erosion and abrasion characteristics. What we infer from the statistical comparison is that the small scale tests provide similar first order result (attractive level of probability) to that at large scale. Therefore, the small scale methods provide a fast, cost-effective screening tool for selection of biological material to proceed to large scale tests.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility of evaluating the strength properties of biological samples via a miniaturised high-throughput method. The abrasion, erosion, water absorption and compression strength tests were all designed to evaluate the resistance nature or strength properties of Bacillus derived macro-components and fractions. The rationale used in this study was to systematically select isolates, macro-components and\/or various fractions with potential strength enhancing properties using the developed bench scale methods followed by validation at large scale.\nThe use of one fraction derived from a B. licheniformis isolate provided a good starting point for selection of potential soil stabilisers, as its associated properties were in line with the selected pre-determined structural criteria. Research shows that the most suitable candidates that produce enzymes, endospores and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) with the potential mechanism to bind soil particles and fill in soil pores belong to the Bacillus sp.\n[17]. Similarly other researchers state that functional by-product production by bacteria in soil is a basis to investigate different geotechnical applications [9,18,19] such as long-term stabilisation of weak soil for road applications. To date, many authors investigated whole-cell bacteria and other associated biological samples using standardised testing methods [20,21], however, none used the strategy to screen a larger number of biological samples with potential applications in the construction industry.\nThe in vitro high-throughput screening of macro-components and fractions derived from Bacillus sp. has been achieved using miniaturised strength tests described herein. The setup of the necessary strength tests to measure the structural functionality criteria (resistance to abrasion, resistance to erosion, water absorption and resistance to compression load tests) in a miniaturised format were successfully demonstrated. The designs for the models were consistent with standard tests, by replicating large scale tests on a smaller scale using 3D printing technology where applicable. These models and procedures were validated based on the ability to repeatedly measure degree of abrasion, erosion, water absorption and compression of the bio-stabilised soil. Descriptions of the methods used were outlined for in vitro high-throughput screening of novel bio-derived samples from a Bacillus isolate. The quantification results (based on the performance data) obtained by using the small scale tests demonstrated that the method for operation of all the models was robust and reliable. By using the miniaturised tests, we can successfully evaluate, select and prioritise the candidate microbes and microbial components by the investigation of specific structural criteria of interest to the soil stabilisation, i.e. abrasion resistance, erosion resistance, compression load resistance and water repulsion properties. The product prototype requires further national large scale tests and will serve as the standard for performance of strength. Further implications in terms of strength requirements will need to be assessed (e.g. focus on materials in response to pressure, temperature or moisture).\nFrom the statistical comparison, the study infers that the small scale tests provide a similar first order result to large scale tests, with the mean values obtained for the negative controls at small scale versus large scale showing similarity. Variations in the comparison obtained with the positive control tests can be attributed to method limitations such as additive binding between the soil particles, surface area and compaction variables due to factors such as material skeletal distribution in large scale samples. By using these systems microbes and microbial components can be rapidly evaluated to enable selection of component types of target microorganisms and for later screening of new isolates of interest. This study has introduced a new and scientifically based paradigm in the development of bio-based structural materials.\nThe different behaviours exhibited by the small scale samples as a function of bio-additive content provides the performance indication on inspection of the abrasion and erosion resistance results. The total bulk behaviour could be well correlated with the standard scale sample by means of a bio-additive binding effectiveness through the abrasion and erosion tests.\nMicro-bonding is deemed to be the contributing factor to effective bonding performance measured at the macro-level. The hypothesised mechanisms includes the generation of particle-binding materials through microbial processes in situ so that the shear strength of soil can be increased; as well as the production of pore-filling materials through microbial means, to significantly reduce the hydraulic conductivity of soil or porous matrices. Products of microbial fermentation processes usually consist of a functional consortium of fermented organic matter, active whole cell bacteria, spores, enzymes, biopolymers, biosurfactants and other proprietary ingredients. New research into these novel primary and secondary metabolites from Bacillus sp. and understanding the micro-structural soil characteristics stability will result in greater knowledge for more macro applications. The initial testing programme focused on demonstrating the effectiveness of the bio-additive in terms of bonding performance. The next phase of the study focuses on the characterisation of agents (physiological, biochemical, and mechanisms of the bio-geochemical processes). Strength properties for the design, including compressive strength testing will form part of the next phase of the testing programme, and lastly field verification.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, miniaturised structural tests were developed using 3D printing technology and modified equipment. More importantly, this is the first study that outlines the processes and methods that can be used for biological samples that undergo high-throughput screening for potential applications in the construction industry. Inclusion of crude fermentation fractions increased resistance to abrasion, resistance to erosion, resistance to compression load and water repulsion properties in comparison to the test control. These observations, in addition to evidence of comparable results obtained for the standard controls, indicate the relevance of further studies. Currently work is being conducted to test the efficacy of the multiple fermentations biological components and fractions on the selected soil types. It is hypothesised that one or more of the microbial components and fractions will have positive effects on the key measurements (i.e. erosion, abrasion, and water absorption and compression resistance) and therefore possess the potential for improving weak subgrade soils and aid in dust and water erosion control on upper surfaces of unpaved low volume roads. Subsequent design of experiments following the small scale tests provides a basis to then select the most promising fractions for further testing on large scale samples. The testing methods described therefore offer a fast, reliable and a cost-effective screening tool for early assessment of structural properties, allowing for prioritisation and selection of microbes and microbial components. Future work involves investigating the potential biological additive\u2019s mode of action.\n\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\n\nResearch involving human participants and\/or animals: This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.\n\n","1394":"\n\nIntroduction\nTactile perception is one of the five human senses. It plays an important role for human beings in object recognition [1-3]. During feeling the texture of a surface, we usually move our fingers across the surface to be able describe it in detail. It is hard to identify the texture when still [4]. This implies that the tactile perception depends on tribological motion between human skin and the sensed surface. The formation of tactile perception is a complex process of nerve conduction and processing. In the process of touching, the vibration and deformation caused by friction stimulate sensory receptors in the skin. The sensory receptors detect and transform this vibration and deformation to nerve action potentials that are conveyed to the corresponding sensing area of the cerebral cortex through the afferent nerve, spinal cord, and brain stem. Finally, tactile perception is formed in the somatosensory cortex [5,6].\nThe sensory receptors in skin are the main receptors of tactile perception, and the cerebral cortex is the cognitiveregion for tactile perception. Tactile perception is related to skin receptors and the cerebral cortex. Currently, most research on tactile perception focuses on the tribological and biomechanical properties of skin. Tang et al. [7] studied the vibration and friction signals of skin during tactile perception and extracted eight characteristic features to represent tactile perception. Bhushan et al. [8] studied the effect of skin cream on the tribological properties of skin and found the amplitude of vibration decreased after cream treatment, leading to smoother perception.\nHowever, there is little research focus on cerebral cortex tactile cognition. Research on tactile perception of materials based on EEG and event-related potential (ERP) technology can skip the usual tactile information transmission channels, such as human nerve endings and muscles, and directly focus on the tactile formation region of the brain [9,10]. Li et al. [11] studied the tactile perception of fingertips when touching sandpaper with different roughness and found that there was a significant correlation between friction perceptions and EEG signals. Moungou et al. [9] studied the steady-state evoked potentials (SS-EP) under different amplitudes of texture exploration-induced vibration and found that textures generating stronger vibration also generated SS-EPs of greater magnitude.\nIt is known that EEG signals are usually accompanied by strong background noise. The ERP technique obtains the event related potentials evoked by surface texturing and further develops the relationship between tactile perception and surface texturing [12]. Among all the ERP components, P300, as a typical endogenous component, has high connection with the brain cognitive process [13]. It is generally believed that the amplitude and peak latency of P300 are mainly affected by the probability of stimulation [14]. Horiba et al. [15] applied ERP technology in fabric evaluation and found the P300 amplitude in an uncomfortable state was higher than in a comfortable state. Chen et al. [16] studied the P300 potential based on different fabric materials and found that fabric with a rougher surface induces higher P300 amplitude.\nTactile sensation of material properties can generally be classified into four fundamental dimensions: roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmness [17]. Among the four perceptual dimensions, the roughness dimension has been demonstrated that is highly prominent perceptual dimensions of surface textures [18,19]. Surface roughness is associated with several physical texture properties, including height differences, spacing between each texture elements, and shape of texture elements [20]. Previous studies have shown surface texturing can improve the tribological performance of contact surface by serving as a micro-hydrodynamic bearing in full or mixed lubrication, a micro-reservoir for lubricant in starved lubrication, and a micro-trap for wear debris in lubricated or dry sliding [21-24]. When hydrated skin contact with a textured surface, the localised pressure perturbation produced by the thin dispersed moisture layers can create a lift to reduce the friction between the contact surfaces that is called micro-hydrodynamics [25]. The micro-hydrodynamics phenomenon was also been found in other biomaterials, such as hip joint [26] and keratin-based gecko feet [27]. Studies of tactile perception based on ERP mostly focus on specific materials such as different fabrics and paper with variable surface features. It is meaningful to study the specific surface texture features that affect material tactile sensation, as understanding these features can help explain the human brain\u2019s cognitive mechanics for tactile perception.\nDuring tactile perception, the electrical system in brain will respond to the changes in vibration, friction, and surface properties between the perceived textured surface and human skin. There are few related studies. The goal of this paper is to systematically study the tactile perception from the surface textures, surface friction, stress response of the skin receptors, and neurophysiological response of the brain. In this study, ERP and friction measurement were carried out during fingers exploring grating surfaces. A finite element finger model was established to analyze the stress changes of the skin receptors during tactile perception This study contributes to understanding the formation process and cognitive mechanism of tactile perception of different surface textures. It also provided an objective feeling evaluation method for skin touched surfaces, skin cream, and fabrics by combining physiological response of brain, skin friction, and surface properties.\n\n\nExperimental methods\nThis research was conducted under the guidance of international ethical standards [28] and was approved by our ethics committee. The experiments were conductedin accordance withthe approved guidelines. We obtained informed consent from all study subjects.\n\nTest bed and samples\nTo ensure the synchronous triggering of events, a tactile trigger device was designed that consists of two tri-axial force sensors and one square-wave generator. The tri-axial force sensors were used to obtain the friction force and touching normal load. The touching normal load was changed into an electric pulse by a square-wave generator that triggered the EEG system amplifier and marked the start of touch. In this way, the synchronization of touching action and EEG data collection could be ensured.\nA test bed was designed. As shown in Fig. 1\n(a), the non-target sample was placed on the pad, and the two target samples were placed on the tri-axial force sensors. The height and the distance between the three samples were consistent. During the test, the assistant moved the slide rail to change the samples.\nSample without any grating texture was selected as non-target sample and was represented by P. Samples with different grating width and spacing were represented by W\ni and S\ni as shown in Fig. 1(b). The sample materials are acrylic plates with Young\u2019s modulus of 3000\u202fMPa and passion rate of 0.39. The gratings on the samples were made by laser processing. The detailed parameters of the samples were shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\nStimuli\nAn oddball paradigm was used to evoke P300 wave, whichwas widely applied in the investigation of multiple cognitive functions. The oddball paradigm usually requires two kinds of stimuli simultaneously, namely target and non-target stimuli [29]. In this paradigm, presentations of sequences of repetitive non-target stimuli are infrequently interrupted by a deviant targetstimulus. P300 wave only occurs if the subject is actively engaged in the task of detecting the target stimuli. During the test, the subject\u2019s attention was required to focus on the rarely presented target stimuli, while the brain electrical response (EEG signals) to unexpectedly occurring \u201cnovel\u201d target stimuli is recorded and investigated [30]. This method can reduce any extraneous neural activity and extract the specific response to the target stimuli. The traditional oddball paradigm has only two stimuli. Under this paradigm, it is impossible to directly compare the effects of two kinds of stimulation on P300. Therefore, an oddball variation paradigm was chosen to evoke P300 in this study. This mode allows one non-target sample and two target samples. The non-target sample occurs more than 70% of the time, and the two target samples occur less than 30% separately. The participants were required to respond to the feeling of the two target samples. The sample test order used a pseudorandom sequence that was not revealed to the participants. It included a total of 120 stimulations (15 times for the two target stimulations, respectively, and 90 times for the non-target stimulation). In this study we want to study the brain response to the grating textures, so the grating samples were chosen as target samples and the non-textured sample (smooth sample) was chosen as non-target sample.\nTo compare the tactile perception of two different kinds of grating samples, six group tests were carried out as shown in Table 2\n.\n\n\nParticipants\nTwelve healthy, right-handed male undergraduates from China University of Mining and Technology, 23\u201327\u202fyears (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation\u202f=\u202f24.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2\u202fyears), took part in this study. Hair was cleaned before the test. Informed consent and personal information were obtained before the experiment. The task was to feel the surface gratings. Training was given to all participants before the test. The training samples were different from the formal test samples. In training, the participants (ears covered and hands free) were asked to use their right index finger to slide along the sample surfaces with a constant normal load about 1.5\u202fN and a 20\u202fmm sliding distance for 0.5\u202fs. A touch was considered one stoke. After the first touch test, the participants lifted their finger, and waited for approximately 1.5\u202fs for the next touch. Therefore, one trial lasted approximately 2\u202fs. In order to trigger the amplifier of EEG system and mark the start of touch, the tests were carried out until the participants could reach almost constant normal load of 1.5\u202fN which can be monitor by the signal collecting system. The participants were asked to maintain this constant rhythm for each formal trial.\nDuring the formal test, the assistant moved the slide rail to change the samples and the participants only needed to slide their finger on the sample with the constant rhythm and focus on feeling the grating textures. There were 120 touches that took 4\u202fmin for one trial. The participants rested for 10\u202fmin. Each trial was repeated twice.\n\n\nEEG and friction measurement\nAll experiments were carried out in a screened EEG laboratory that insulates sound and electromagnetic interference. The ambient condition was 18\u201322\u202f\u00b0C, and the relative humidity was 40\u201355%. The friction and touching normal load were collected by the tri-axial force sensors which was simultaneous with EEG measurement.\nEEG data were recorded by a 32-channel EEG-System (BrainAmp, Brain Products, Munich, Germany) with sampling frequency of 1000\u202fHz.Electrode impedance was maintained below 5 k\u03a9 throughout the study.\nEEG data were processed through the Brain Vision Analyzer (Brain Products, GmbH, Munich). The data were referenced to an averaged ears montage, the bandpass was filtered between 0.1 and 30\u202fHz, and the baseline correction was done.\nThe data was then further processed and analyzed using MATLAB toolboxes (Lopez-Calderon&Luck, 2014). The analysis process included curvefitting and identification of P300 waves. The ERP waveform was obtained by superimposing and averaging the EEG data for all touches in one trail. The P300 is an ERP component elicited in the process of decision making, which usually happens after approximately 300\u202fms in the ERP waveform. So, a MATLAB platform (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was designed to obtain the peak voltage of the ERP waveform between 250 and 450\u202fms for each electrode, and this was chosen as the P300 peak amplitude. The time corresponding to the peak voltage was chosen as the latency of P300. Fig. 2\n(a) shows a typical ERP waveform of one trial for one electrode. The average peak amplitude and latency of P300 for all trials for each electrode were calculated.\nThe parietal and occipital lobes are mostly related with cognition [31,32]. The electrodes of C3, CZ, C4, CP1, CP2, P3, PZ and P4 were in the corresponding positions on the EEG cap and were chosen as the test electrodes to collect the EEG signals, shown in Fig. 2(b). The M1 and M2 earlobeelectrodes were chosen as reference electrodes.\n\n\nSubjective evaluation\nThirty healthy, right-handed undergraduates from China University of Mining and Technology, 23\u201327\u202fyears (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation\u202f=\u202f24.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fyears), took part in subjective evaluation. Training was given to all participants before the test which was same with the EEG test. In the test, the feelings of the gratings were divided into smooth, scratchy, and distinctive. The distinctive feeling means feeling the difference between smooth and grating samples. The participants graded samples according to the three dimensions, and the scores (ranging 0\u20135) were averaged for each subject. Higher human evaluation scores for smooth, scratchy, and distinctive feelings correspond to smoother feeling, scratchier feeling, and more recognizable feeling, respectively.\nThe smooth sample (P) was initially presented to participants as reference stimulus. It was informed that evaluation scores for smooth, scratchy, and distinctive feelings were 5, 0, and 0 for reference stimulus. In each trial, participants first felt the reference stimuli, followed by experiencing one of the six stimuli (W\n1, W\n2, W\n3, S\n1, S\n2, and S\n3), and orally reported the perceived feelings of the given stimulus. Each stimulus was presented twice per participant.\n\n\nFinite element model\nThe mechanoreceptors embedded in skin are the tactilestimulus receptors. Since it is difficult to obtain the stress on cutaneous mechanoreceptors during tactile perception, a multilayer finite element model was established to analyze the stress using a commercial software package, ABAQUS\/Standard (Version 6.12).\nIt is known that skin is a nonlinear, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic material. Previous studies showed that a two-dimensional plane strain model of fingertip composed of a homogeneous linear elastic material can predict the stress and strain distributions within skin, and thus the response profiles of the mechanoreceptors under rectangular gratings [33-35]. Meanwhile, the deformation of skin was small for the applied pressure in the model. Therefore, we simplified the fingertip model as a two-dimensional plane strain model composed of a homogeneous linear elastic material. This finger model was divided into four parts, namely, the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous soft tissue, and bone as shown in Fig. 3\n. The parameters of four finger layers and the samples are shown in Table 3\n. The constraint types of different layers were set as \u201cTie\u201d. The resolutions of the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous soft tissue, and bone were set as 0.1\u202fmm, 0.2\u202fmm, 0.5\u202fmm, and 1\u202fmm. Because subcutaneous soft tissue and bone were not analyzed so they were set with lower resolutions. \u201cSurface to surface contact(Standard)\u201d was chosen as the contact element type. The perceived sample was fixed by constructing constraints for all degrees of freedom of its base line, namely DOF (degree of freedom) is 0. The DOF of finger model was not restricted and it is 3.\nAccording to the references [38], the mechanoreceptors can be considered as infinitesimal elements. The Meissner and Merkel corpuscles are located near the interface between the epidermis and dermis [39]. In the model, the locations of the two mechanoreceptors were simplified as nearby soft tissues. To simplify the analysis process, the finite element model only establishes the contact part between finger skin and the sample, and the outline of the fingertip was ignored.\nThe simulation process was divided into two steps: static loading and dynamic sliding. In the first analysis step, the perceived sample was fixed by constructing constraints for all degrees of freedom of its base line. A pressure of 1\u202fkPa was uniformly loaded on the finger model. In the second analysis, a boundary condition of 16\u202fmm\/s velocity was applied to finger model. Then, the finger scanned over the surface of the perceived sample at the given speed and pressure. The formula of finite sliding was defined between the finger and the perceived sample. Friction formulation was set as \u201cPenalty\u201d. The coefficient of friction between the finger and the perceived sample was set as 0.5 in this model. The applied pressure, velocity, and coefficient of friction were set based on the tactile perception experiment results.\n\n\n\nResults and discussions\n\nFinite element analysis\nThe perception processes were simulated according to the six grating samples in the experiment. Fig. 4\n show the nephogram and graph of Mises stress when the finger contacted different grating widths and spacing. Fig. 4(a) show that the deformation of finger skin and the Mises stress near the Meissner and Merkel corpuscles increased with increasing grating width, indicating that larger skin deformation generates greater stress. The greater stress then induces greater tactile stimulation to the mechanoreceptors. Fig. 4(b) shows that the frequency of stress increased with decreasing grating spacing. The periodic stress causes vibration stimulation to the Meissner and Merkel corpuscles, and higher stimulation vibration frequency induces stronger tactile stimulation to the mechanoreceptors. The finite element results support the friction and ERP experimental results discussed in the following section.\n\n\nFrictional properties of skin\nThe friction coefficients and contact areas of fingers when touching the different gratings are shown in Fig. 5\n. The normal load W and friction force F were obtained from the tri-axial force sensor. The friction coefficient \u03bc was calculated with \u03bc\u202f=\u202fF\/W. In order to obtain the contact area, a streak camera was used to get the contact images during the touching of surface. Then the contact areas were extracted and calculated.\nThe results show that the friction coefficient increases with increasing grating width when the grating spacing is constant. As the fingers scan over the surface, deformation increases with increasing grating width, resulting in a larger coefficient of friction.\nWhen the grating width is constant, the friction coefficient increases with grating spacing. Due to the small 1\u202fmm grating width, finger deformation does not play a key role in the friction force. In this case, the force mainly comes from adhesive friction. As shown in Fig. 5(b), it was found that the reduction of grating spacing and the increase of grating width decreased the effective contact areas between the skin and the samples. The reduction of grating spacing decreases the effective contact area between the skin and the samples, thus resulting in a smaller adhesive friction and coefficient of friction.\nThe friction force produces deformation and vibration stimulating the mechanoreceptors embedded in skin. The mechanoreceptors have the ability to detect, code, and transform this tactile information to the corresponding sensing area of the cerebral cortex through the sense-conductingpathway. Friction affects the tactile perception. The grating width and spacing induce different friction coefficients, implying the different tactile perceptions formed in the brain. It is necessary to discuss the electroencephalogram when humans feel different textural features.\n\n\nSubjective evaluation\nThe average evaluation scores of the three feelings for all gratings are shown in Table 4\n.\nThe result shows that the smooth feeling decreases, and the scratchy and distinctive feelings increase with increasing grating width. The larger grating width increases the surface roughness and friction coefficient leading to decreasing smooth feeling. The wider the texture grating is, the higher the contact pressure and skin deformation, which induce a larger scratching feeling that is easier to identify.\nIt also shows that smooth feeling scores decrease with decreasing grating spacing. The smaller grating width increases the surface roughness, leading to decreasing smooth feeling. The scratchy and distinctive feelings increase with decreasing grating spacing. The smaller the grating spacing is, the larger the skin vibration, which induces a greater scratching feeling that is easier to identify.\n\n\nP300 analysis\nThe P300 is an ERP component elicited in the process of decision making. It usually happens after approximately 300\u202fms in the ERP waveform. In this section, the peak amplitude and peak latency of P300 are discussed. Fig. 6\n and Fig. 7\n summarize the P300 components induced by samples with different grating widths and spaces.\n\n\nPeak latency of P300\nThe P300 peak latency is usually interpreted as the speed of stimulus classification resulting from discrimination of one event from another. It is an index of classification speed proportional to stimulus evaluation timing that is sensitive to task processing demands, and the P300 peak latency varies with individual differences in cognitive capability [40]. In this study, the P300 latency shows the volunteer\u2019s judgment speed for tactile distinction between the target grating samples and smooth non-target samples. As shown in Fig. 6, the peak latency of W\n1 is larger than for W\n2 in group 1; the peak latency of W\n1 is larger than for W\n3 in group 2, and the peak latency of W\n2 is larger than for W\n3 in group 3. The results suggest that the textural characteristics of grating width affect the P300 peak latency. It shows that the sample with larger grating width can induce a shorter P300 peak latency, indicating the participants that recognize the wider grating quickly and easily. The subjective evaluation of distinctive feeling and the difference between the smooth non-target sample and grating target samples on Mises stress reveal that W\n1\u202f<\u202fW\n2\u202f<\u202fW\n3. The larger scores of distinctive feeling and larger differences of Mises stress lead to easier recognition of the grating texture, further inducing a shorter P300 peak latency for the samples with larger grating width.\nAlso, the difference of P300 peak latency between samples W\n2 and W\n3 is particularly small, which is coincident with the results of the P300 amplitude. As shown in Table 4, the subjective evaluation of W\n2 and W\n3 are close, suggesting that the surfaces with similar texture feeling will induce a similar P300 component.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the peak latency of S\n1 is larger than S\n2 in group 4, the peak latency of S\n1 is larger than S\n3 in group 5, and the peak latency of S\n2 is larger than S\n3 in group 6. The results suggest that the textural characteristics of grating spacing affect the P300 peak latency; samples with smaller grating spacing can induce shorter P300 peak latency. Taken together, the subjective evaluation of distinctive feeling and the difference between the grating and smooth samples in regard to friction coefficient and stress show that S\n1\u202f<\u202fS\n2\u202f<\u202fS\n3. The larger scores for distinctive feeling and the larger differences in friction coefficient and Mises stress lead to easier texture recognition, further inducing a shorter P300 peak latency for samples with smaller grating spacing.\n\n\nPeak amplitude of P300\nThe P300 peak amplitude is defined as the voltage difference between the largest positive peaks from thebaselineof the EEG waveform within the latency window [41]. The peak amplitude of the P300 is proportional to the amount of attentional resources engaged in processing a given stimulus, and it is not influenced by factors related to response selection or execution [42]. The P300 peak amplitude is significantly affected by perception and attention factors that reflect the excitability of the brain.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the peak amplitude in W\n2 is larger than in W\n1 in group 1, the peak amplitude of W\n3 is larger than in W\n1 in group 2, and the peak amplitude of W\n3 is slightly larger than in W\n2 in group 3. The results suggest that grating width textural characteristics affect the P300 peak amplitude. These findings demonstrate that the sample with larger grating width evokes higher P300 peak amplitude, indicating that the participants use more attentional resources in the tactile perception of wider gratings.\nTaken together, the subjective evaluation of scratchy feeling, the coefficient of friction, and the Mises stress values show W\n1\u202f<\u202fW\n2\u202f<\u202fW\n3. The larger grating width generates greater skin deformation, friction force, and stress, and it induces stronger tactile stimulation to the mechanoreceptors, further evoking a higher P300 peak amplitude.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the peak amplitude of S\n2 is larger than that of S\n1 in group 4, the peak amplitude of S\n3 is larger than that of S\n1 in group 5, and the peak amplitude of S\n3 is larger than that of S\n2 in group 6. The results suggest that grating space features affect the P300 peak amplitude. This finding reveals that samples with smaller grating spacing evoke higher P300 peak amplitudes. As the results show in the finite element analysis, smaller grating spacing generates higher frequency vibration stimulation to the mechanoreceptors, thus inducing stronger tactile stimulation and further evoking higher P300 peak amplitude.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThis paper systematically studied the tactile perception from the surface textures, surface friction, stress response of the skin receptors, and neurophysiological response of the brain. The conclusions are as follows.\nThe stress concentrations around the Meissner and Merkel receptors are affected by the grating textures during tactile perception. The deformation of finger skin and the Mises stress near the Meissner and Merkel corpuscles increase with increasing grating width. The frequency of stress increases with decreasing grating spacing.\nThe friction on the skin is affected by grating textures during tactile perception. The friction coefficient increases with increasing grating width and spacing. Skin deformation increases with increasing grating width and generates larger deformation friction. The skin contact area increases with increasing grating spacing, generating larger adhesive friction.\nP300 evoked by gratings are related with the skin deformation, contact area, friction force, and stress around cutaneous mechanoreceptors. P300 latency is related to the difference between the grating target stimulus and the smooth non-target stimulus. The larger the distinctive feeling value is, the larger the difference in friction coefficient and stress between the smooth non-target sample and the grating target samples is, and the easier the grating texture can be recognized. The P300 peak amplitude increases with increasing grating width and decreasing spacing. The wider grating width generates larger skin deformation, friction force, and stress, which induces stronger tactile stimulation. The smaller grating spacing generates higher vibration frequency, inducing stronger tactile stimulation.\nThis study objectively proofed that ERP methods are useful to study the brain's response to tactile perception and there is a relationship between the activation in brain regions, surface friction, and contact conditions of skin during the tactile perception.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5).

Installation of trash-rack causes disturbance in fluid flow with inevitable energy losses which should be minimized. To reduce these losses and to keep the design simple for manufacturing and cleaning, trash-racks, oriented perpendicular to fluid flow, usually consist of many rectangular bars directed parallel to fluid flow. Another main purpose of trash-rack is to prevent fish species from entering the intake system [1]. With growing ecological concern [2], influence of trash-rack design on fish migration and fish mortality is increasingly taken into consideration [3,4]. Trash-rack is not a suitable obstacle for some fish species, especially for juvenile fish, which could be entrapped in turbine parts. Furthermore, in case of large approaching velocities, some fish species are incapable of avoiding trash-rack which can cause fatal injuries when colliding with bars. Increased awareness of these problems prompted a change in the design of hydroelectric power plants intake system. Inclined trash-racks in combination with angled bars are increasingly considered to provide better fish guidance toward fishways which are being installed to provide safe passageway for upstream or downstream migration considering fish behaviour [5,6]. Due to site specifications and fish species characteristics, great number of case studies regarding fishway efficiency are being conducted [7,8]. Multidisciplinary approach is also considered to improve current knowledge and practice of fishways [9].\nTo determine energy losses, a number of experimental investigations on trash-racks were conducted. Idel\u2019chik [10] proposed empirical relationship regarding different bar cross sections, bar spacing and rack angles that estimates head loss for bars parallel to fluid flow. The United States Army Corps of Engineers [11] proposed head loss coefficient values based on summarized open channel tests with racks perpendicular to fluid flow for different bar designs and spacings. Tsikata et al. [12] experimentaly investigated influence of bar spacing and bar length on head losses where it was shown that bar length reduction and increasement in bar spacing reduce head losses. Furthermore, fluid flow around angled bar racks and influence of different cross sections (rectangular, bar with rounded leading edge and streamlined bar) were analysed in [13]. Significant reduction in head losses was observed when rectangular cross section edges were rounded or cross section was replaced with streamlined shape. Bar inclination to the approaching flow was investigated only for rectangular cross section while for other cross sections bars remained parallel to the fluid flow, where head loss value increased when bar inclination increased. Asymmetric flow behind inclined bars was also reported. Vortex shedding behind trash-rack bars induce vibrations which can interfere with natural frequency of the trash-rack and cause damage to bars. Therefore, structural aspect of trash-rack exploitation must be also taken into consideration [14]. Since design of trash-rack varies greatly and trash-racks are used in wide range of operating conditions, number of experimental and numerical studies investigated this problem [15\u201317]. Clark et al. [18] analysed head losses for six different cross sections (rectangular, rounded, commercially available bar and variants of NACA airfoil) for bars parallel to fluid flow and reported increase in head loss when channel inclination before trash-rack i.e. approach flow inclination increases. In Raynal et al. [19] different trash-rack inclinations with regards to channel flume bottom were investigated where new head loss equation considering blockage ratio, bar shape and rack inclination was proposed. Additionally [20], rectangular and hydrodynamic bar shapes were analyzed for various trash-rack to flume wall angles (while bars were kept perpendicular to the trash-rack). In more recent research, Albayrak et al. [21] investigated a wide range of angled trash-rack configurations for rectangular and rounded bars and other geometry parameters and proposed new head loss equation which included relation between bar spacing, rack and bar angles (primary parameters) and bar length, relative rack submergence and bar shape (secondary parameters). Szabo-Meszaros et al. [4] examined six different configurations of streamlined and rectangular bar profiles for different bar-setups; in four configurations trash-rack was inclined against the channel wall for various bar angles while two configurations had horizontally oriented bars. Horizontal trash-racks and vertical with streamlined bars were suggested as the best candidates for fish-friendly trash-racks. Zayed et al. investigated influence of screen angle from the trapezoidal open channel wall for angled trash-racks [22] and V-shaped trash-rack [23], both with circular bars where new head loss equations were proposed. In Beck et al. [24] a new innovative curved bar design was investigated. B\u00f6ttcher et al. [25] compared trash-rack with circular bars and new fish protection and guidance system - flexible fish fence where common head loss equations were adapted for new proposed design.\nFew numerical studies investigated flow around trash-racks. Raynal et al. [26] validated two-dimensional fluid flow analysis for bars angled at 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nusing their previous experimental results, under-estimating head loss experimental results. In work by Paul et al. [27], 3D analysis of fluid flow around 3 and 7 submerged bar-racks was conducted, where numerical analysis overestimated experimental head loss coefficient. \u00c5kerstedt et al. [28] conducted an investigation for rectangular and biconvex bars for different inclinations of fully submerged trash-rack, where simplification was made with periodic boundary conditions and two-dimensional fluid flow domain.\nIt can be noticed that most experiments from previous studies considered two bar cross section shapes at most, whereas the proposition of different cross sections could provide more favourable hydraulic conditions, especially considering configurations with angled trash-racks and angled bars. The main problem with innovative designs (e.g. V shape trash-rack in [23] and curved bar shapes in [24]) is that researchers usually define trash-rack geometry a priori, hence optimal solution could be overlooked. The uniqueness of power plant intake geometry must also be taken into consideration since channel geometry after trash-rack is usually not regular as in experimental setups. Geometry changes in the intake channel, inclination or narrowing, are important since they affect head losses, especially if analyzing bars with greater angle of inclination. In those cases, recirculating zones are longer with the possibility of geometry interference in the wake zone which may also lead to turbine efficiency reduction. Numerical studies provide a solution for a number of presented problems. In the numerical approach, the whole turbine geometry can be modelled in full scale, the influence of all geometry parameters can be evaluated and fluid flow can be investigated in more detail [29]. Furthermore, an optimization procedure can be conducted to provide optimal trash-rack configuration for specific turbine that is investigated.\nIn this work, numerical simulations are conducted for four different cross sections with different configurations of trash-rack and bar inclinations. To validate the numerical results, trash-rack configurations are chosen according to experiments conducted by Albayrak et al. [21]. Following the numerical model validation, cross section influence on head loss reduction for different configurations is further investigated. Finally, optimization of simplified trash-rack geometry for a 50\u202fyears old hydroelectric power plant HE Senj (Senj, Croatia) is conducted in order to provide optimal cross-section regarding the head losses.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nGeometry definition\nNumerical simulations are conducted for trash-rack inserted in 1\u202fm wide, 12\u202fm long and 0.1\u202fm deep flume with constant rectangular cross section (Fig. 1\n). Flume and bar dimensions are chosen to validate numerical simulation with full scale trash-rack model investigated in Albayrak et al. [21], for the trash-rack inclination of 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand rectangular bars with inclinations of 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n, 67.5\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n. Bars are considered completely submerged. Flow velocity ranges from 0.13 to 0.43\u202fm\/s, in accordance to experiment. Trash-rack bars are 0.1\u202fm long with the greatest cross section width of 0.01\u202fm and with bar spacing 0.05\u202fm. Reynolds bar number \n\nRs\n=\nUs\n\/\n\u03bd\n\n where U is approaching velocity and s bar width ranges from 1295 to 4285. After validation, further investigation is conducted for trash-rack inclinations of (\n\n\u03b1\n\n angle) 15\n\n\u00b0\n\n, 30\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nwith bar inclinations of (\n\n\u03b2\n\n angle) 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n, 67.5\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nfor different cross sections. Influence of bar spacing on head losses for different bar and trash-rack inclinations is investigated in Albayrak et al. [21] so this parameter is kept constant for all conducted simulations and only influence of cross section change was considered.\nFour different cross section geometries are considered \u2013 rectangular, rhombus, rounded front edge with inclined back in the lower half and rounded front edge with inclination starting right after rounded edge (Fig. 1). Hereinafter considered cross sections will be referred to as cross section A, B, C and D, respectively. In cross sections B, C and D, sharp edges are avoided due to production reasons. Consequently, 2\u202fmm straight segments can be seen in cross section profiles.\nGeometry and trash-rack placement in the channel can be seen in Fig. 1. The trash-rack origin for all geometries is set at 3 m downstream from the inlet. Cross sections considered for head loss measurements for numerical model validation are defined 3 m upstream (inlet) and 3 m downstream from the trash-rack origin. For all other configurations, head loss measurements were conducted on inlet and outlet cross sections.\nNumber of bars on trash-rack depends on \n\n\u03b1\n\n and \n\n\u03b2\n\n angles, which leads to different blockage of fluid flow on flume sides for different configurations, e.g. for configuration \n\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nbars can be spaced on trash-rack in a way there is no clearance on flume sides or with clearance on both flume sides if one bar is removed. Numerical investigation of both configurations shows around 15% difference in head loss coefficient. Considering this information is usually not mentioned when the experiment is described to avoid influence of side clearance, outer bars were extended to completely block the fluid flow. A similar method can be seen in Raynal [26] where sides of the trash-rack domain were cut off.\nFor the configuration with greatest fluid flow blockage (\n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n), 3D multiphase, 3D single phase and 2D simulations are conducted. 3D multiphase fluid flow simulation best describes the open channel nature of the experiment but requires considerable computational resources, thus simplification is made to reduce computational time. A 3D geometry is created where domain height is set as an estimation of free surface level which was constant throughout the whole domain. This simplification allowed usage of a single phase fluid flow model which significantly reduced computational time. Since cross section along the vertical axis remained constant, 2D simulations are also considered. All three simulations provide similar results - both 3D models underestimate the head loss coefficient for around 14% while 2D single phase model underestimation is around 15%. Consequently, for all configurations, 2D simulation is chosen in order to reduce computational time.\n\n\nNumerical model\nSimulations are conducted in ANSYS-Fluent for an unstructured mesh with local refinement around trash-rack and channel walls. Considering that changes in trash-rack configuration greatly influence fluid flow field (e.g. width and length of recirculation zone) and keeping in mind that optimization should be conducted with automated meshing, i.e. cannot be further refined according to simulation results, meshing parameters are kept the same for all considered configurations. First layer height is defined to maintain \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n+\n\n\n>\n30\n\n and scalable wall functions are used. Global element edge size is defined to be within 0.016\u202fm and 0.0001\u202fm with prescribed value of 0.004\u202fm. Maximum size of the element edge for bar edges is defined as 0.003\u202fm and for channel wall 0.005\u202fm. Mesh independence study is conducted for configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n with numerical meshes sizing 230 000, 413 000, 723 000 and 920 000 elements (Table 1\n). Values of head loss coefficient became constant for numerical mesh consisting of 723 000 elements, which prompted the choice of the grid with around 800 000 elements (depending on trash-rack configuration) for all simulations. Detailed investigation of turbulent models for numerical simulations of fluid flow around trash-rack was conducted in previous study [30], where it was observed that k-\n\n\u220a\n\n standard turbulence model generates greatest head loss values showing the best agreement with experimental results at the same time. In general, when greater recirculation zone is present behind trash-rack, k-\n\n\u220a\n\n standard turbulence model shows stability in results, while other models tend to oscillate. Due to these observations, k-\n\n\u220a\n\n standard turbulence model is chosen for all simulations in this study. Overview of boundary conditions can be seen in Table 2\n.\nNumerical simulation is done by solving the steady-state incompressible isothermal Navier\u2013Stokes (NS) equations which describe the fluid flow:\n\n(1)\n\n\u2207\n\u00b7\nu\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n(\nu\n\u00b7\n\u2207\n)\nu\n=\n-\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n\u2207\np\n+\n\u03bd\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\n2\n\n\nu\n+\nf\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nu\n\n is the velocity vector, p represents the pressure, \n\n\u03c1\n\n is the fluid density, \n\n\u03bd\n\n is the fluid kinematic viscosity and \n\nf\n\n represents the external forces acting upon the fluid (e.g. gravity). Eq. (1) represents the conservation of mass while Eq. (2) defines the conservation of momentum of fluid flow. Reynolds averaging is additionally applied to the NS equations for turbulence modeling.\nChosen fluid is water with properties for temperature of 20\n\n\u00b0\n\n (Table 3\n). Pressure-velocity coupling SIMPLE algorithm is used and discretization scheme for the convection terms of governing equations is second order upwind. Convergence criteria is assumed if all residuals drop below 10\u22125 and additionally no change of head loss coefficient is observed with further iterations.\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nValidation of simulation\nValidation is conducted for rectangular bars with \n\n\u03b1\n\n angle 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand \n\n\u03b2\n\n angles 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n, 67.5\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\n for four different velocities, 0.13, 0.23, 0.33 and 0.43\u202fm\/s. Head loss coefficient is calculated as (to match the head loss coefficient in Albayrak [21]):\n\n(3)\n\nk\n=\n\u0394\np\n\n\n2\ng\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq. (3)\n\n\n\n\nU\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n is inlet velocity and \n\n\u0394\np\n\n is the pressure difference between upstream and downstream cross sections. Pressure difference represents an approximation of water level difference (\n\n\u0394\n\nh) present in experiments. This assumption is validated with aforementioned comparison with multiphase simulation results where small variation was present for both considered models.\nA greater recirculation zone for trash-racks with greater bar inclination is noticed in the simulations (Fig. 2\n). Highly turbulent flow behind trash-rack was also observed in experiments [21]. For \n\n\u03b2\n\n angle 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\n recirculation zone accounts for around one third of channel cross section, which is in agreement with Raynal [26]. For \n\n\u03b2\n\n angle 67.5\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nrecirculation zone is present in around half of the channel, while for \n\n\u03b2\n\n angle 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nrecirculation zone increases even more and with that suppresses fluid flow and increases head losses (pressure drop). For the same inlet velocities, with the change in trash-rack configuration, greater recirculation zone leads to higher magnitudes of velocities due to the reduced cross sectional area available for fluid flow. This produces a greater variance in downstream velocity profiles.\nMeasurement locations must be placed at an adequate distance where fluid flow is undisturbed in order to obtain precise data. That is often a problem, due to the space limitation of the experiment. Mean velocities at observed cross-sections, that are needed to determine head loss coefficient in the experiment, are calculated with water height measurements at a given number of points or combined with flow rate measurements - depending on available instruments. For example, in Albayrak [21] three points in the measurement cross section were considered. This is especially a problem if measurements are made in a recirculation zone where great velocity variation in the cross section is present. Therefore, the average of measurements with a smaller number of points and measurements with a greater number of points can produce significantly different results.\nWith the increase in \n\n\u03b2\n\n angle, a greater deviation in results is observed, where simulation underestimates head loss coefficient with maximum deviation of 15%. Geometry simplifications must be taken into consideration regarding this deviation since the trash-rack structure is simplified, e.g. spacers are omitted from the geometry. Design of trash-rack sides is not defined in the experiment description and is thus chosen arbitrarily for simulation, as mentioned previously in Section b. Albayrak [21] reported a head loss difference of 15% for some configurations due to scale effects. Free surface measurement can also generate errors, with a deviation of around 5% as reported in Raynal [20]. Also, when considering experiments which have low water heights, the bottom has a greater influence on head loss coefficient due to friction, while in real turbine intakes, these water heights are always greater. Water depth to channel width ratio in the experiment is always considerably smaller than 1, while in real intakes it is greater, making the influence of bottom surface negligible, thus resulting in an overestimation of head loss coefficient measurements in experimental studies. To avoid uncertainty regarding aforementioned issues, head loss coefficient is normalized as:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nk\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq. (4)\n\n\n\n\nk\n\n\ne\n\n\n\n represents experimental head loss coefficients for given trash-rack configuration and \n\n\n\nk\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n represents maximum head loss coefficient observed in all considered experiments. Normalization of head loss coefficients will be used in the course of this study.\nValidation of numerical results can be seen in Fig. 3\n. Normalized values of head loss coefficient obtained from simulations show good agreement with normalized values of experiment results. Greatest discrepancy is 4% for \n\n\u03b2\n\n=90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nwhere for other configurations it is under 2%. Numerical analysis shows very small variation in head loss coefficient due to change in inlet velocity, contrary to the experiment which is subjected to measurement errors. This behaviour is expected, because head loss coefficient equation is chosen to be invariant of the inlet velocity.\n\n\nNumerical shape investigation\nNumerical investigations are conducted for 4 different cross sections with 9 different combinations of \n\n\u03b1\n\n and \n\n\u03b2\n\n angles for inlet velocity 0.43\u202fm\/s. Measurement locations for verification are set at inlet and 6\u202fm downstream from inlet. At these measurement locations for some configurations, large recirculation zone is observed and for configurations with \n\n\u03b1\n\n\u202f=\u202f15\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nif trash-rack starts 3\u202fm downstream, measurement location at 6\u202fm is not behind the trash-rack (in experiment trash-rack location varied due to space limitation where in this study it is set 3\u202fm downstream from the inlet). Therefore, numerical shape investigation measurements are conducted at inlet and outlet cross sections. Trash-rack position for different \n\n\u03b1\n\n angles and influence on fluid flow field can be seen in Fig. 4\n.\nInvestigations conducted for different cross sections with different ranges of bar and trash-rack inclinations showed that for most configurations, cross section A provides the greatest head loss coefficient (since the A area is the largest when compared to other bar types) with the exception of configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nand \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 30\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\n where cross section B generates the greatest head loss coefficient. This could be explained with cross section A creating better fluid flow guidance (smaller turbulence zones) when fluid flow is perpendicular to bar orientation. The smallest head loss coefficient was observed mostly for cross section C, with the exception of configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 15\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nwhere cross section B generated the smallest head loss. For greater \n\n\u03b1\n\n and \n\n\u03b2\n\n angles, selection of cross section is more relevant, whereas for smaller angles, the value of head loss coefficient is similar for all cross sections. These results are presented in Fig. 5\n where values of normalized head loss coefficient (normalized with value of greatest head loss, i.e. cross section B for configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n), for cross sections that generate greatest and smallest head loss, are presented for all configurations.\nIt can be observed that trash-rack configuration (inclinations of trash-rack and bars) has the greatest influence on head loss. Simulation results show that for greatest bar inclination (\n\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n) reduction of trash-rack inclination (\n\n\u03b1\n\n) leads to a reduction of head loss greater than 40%. For greatest considered trash-rack inclination (\n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n), reduction of bar inclination leads up to head loss reduction of around 80%. For smaller inclinations (for example \n\n\u03b2\n\n= 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b1\n\n is changed or \n\n\u03b1\n\n=15\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nwhere \n\n\u03b2\n\n is changed) lesser reductions in head loss can be observed, which is expected due to the fact that values of head loss coefficient are generally smaller for these configurations. Configurations that provide better fish avoidance are increasingly being installed, but since they cause more losses, influence of cross section becomes more prominent.\nIn Fig. 6\n normalized head loss values are presented for all considered configurations and for all cross sections. Reduction of head losses due to change in cross section accounts mostly for around 10%. Results for configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 15\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nare not aligned with the trend of other configurations which could be explained due to small head loss coefficients for configurations with \n\n\u03b2\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n\n\n(seen in Fig. 5). For these configurations, a reduction of \n\n\u03b1\n\n angle or change in cross section geometry generates a very small reduction of head loss. For some configurations, different cross sections provide very similar results, where if the configuration is changed, the head loss coefficient difference becomes greater i.e. cross section selection is more prominent. For example, for trash-rack configuration \n\n\u03b1\n\n = 45\n\n\u00b0\n,\n\u03b2\n\n = 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n\nboth cross section A and D generate similar head loss coefficient, where if \n\n\u03b1\n\n angle is decreased to 15\n\n\u00b0\n\n\ncross section A generates the greatest head loss coefficient. This shows that generalization of the optimal cross section cannot be made, hence it must be optimized for every trash-rack configuration, especially when new designs such as V-shaped trash-rack [23] start being implemented.\n\n\nCross section optimization\nOptimization of bar cross section is conducted for turbine intake system of 50\u202fyears old hydroelectric power plant HE Senj (Senj, Croatia) (Fig. 7\na). Since the power plant is in the need of reconstruction, a new trash-rack design is being considered also. In the time of power plant construction there was no concern for fish species so trash-rack consisted of rectangular bars installed parallel and trash-rack perpendicular to fluid flow.\nThe optimization process is conducted for simplified geometry; trash-rack remained perpendicular and bars parallel to fluid flow. Distance between bars and their length is kept the same and only cross sections are changed. Validation of numerical simulation was conducted for rectangular cross section. Results showed good agreement with available empirical results [10] and with in situ measurements with error around 4%. Three different cross sections, which are chosen due to easy machining, are considered: cross section with front and back inclinations, cross section with curvature at front and back and cross section with front curvature and back inclination. For the first cross section, four optimization variables defining width and length of inclination are considered. The second cross section has three optimization variables which define the radius of front curvature and inclination width and length in the back. For the last cross section, two optimization variables which define the front and back curvature are considered (Fig. 7b). There are no limitations imposed on optimization variables due to construction reasons, thus considered shapes present theoretical solution. Overview of optimization variables for each optimization case is presented in Table 4\n.\nOptimization is done using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is a population based search algorithm that is inspired by swarm intelligence, such as birds flock or fish school movements [31]. The starting point of PSO is to initially randomly generate, within certain bounds, a set of solutions (swarm) to a problem and iteratively evaluate the quality (fitness) of every candidate solution (particle). After every evaluation, the position of every particle is adjusted towards the local or global optimal position. Movement of every particle through the problem space is influenced both by its own best solution and swarm\u2019s best solution. This process continues until values converge into a satisfactory and\/or steady set of solutions. Factors such as particle cognitive rate, social rate, and problem space movement inertia greatly influence the optimal position convergence. The PSO algorithm implemented in the python optimization package inspyred is used with swarm size of 10 particles, inertia factor 0.75, cognitive rate 1 and social rate 1.\nGoal functions for all considered optimization cases are defined as:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nminf\n\n\na\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\na\n\n\n)\n=\n\u0394\np\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nminf\n\n\nb\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\nb\n\n\n)\n=\n\u0394\np\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\nb\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nminf\n\n\nc\n\n\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\nc\n\n\n)\n=\n\u0394\np\n(\n\n\nx\n\n\nc\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Eq.

(6) can be seen in Table 4.\nOptimization is conducted several times to verify results. Results converged to identical solutions for every cross section separately. Particle swarm optimization is used where for all three cross sections optimization variables converged in their upper limits. For case (a) optimization generated a cross section with maximum front and back inclinations which generated rhombus shaped cross section. For case (b) front edge has maximum curvature with maximum inclination in the back, which generated streamlined shaped bar and for case (c) optimization generated cross section with front and back edges with maximum curvature. These results are expected since all considered profiles converged in cross section with minimal cross section area; they generated the smallest head loss which validated this optimization process. Initial and optimized cross sections with indicated optimization parameters can be seen in Fig. 7b.\nSharp edges in cross sections must be carefully considered due to production, exploitation and safety reasons. During the process of trash rack cleaning considerable forces can be induced on bars, especially when removing debris stuck between bars, which If trash rack cleaning system is in direct contact with the trash-rack, forces induced during interaction can cause structural damage. Also, depending on the hydroelectric power plant location, different intakes are subjected to different type of debris. Considered HE Senj mainly deals with smaller debris (weed or branches) so rhombus shaped bars that have thinner front edge can be considered for installation. However, if greater debris (logs) is frequently present at intake it can cause damage to construction if that type of cross section is chosen. Also, depending on configuration, sharp edges can cause fish injuries when interacting with trash-rack. This problem is also present with rectangular cross section, where for some bar inclinations (e.g. 90\n\n\u00b0\n\n) rhombus shape provides a safer solution. Considering these problems are problem specific, edge thickness constraints must be defined in accordance.\nFor different intake geometries, shape optimization of the bar cross section can be conducted to provide the optimal solution. Hence, cross sections that are usually not used, can be derived as an optimal result for specific intake (e.g. innovative design considered in [24]). In this study, only parameters defining cross section are included as optimization parameters, however, other geometry parameters such as bar spacing, bar length, bar inclination etc. can also be included. Cross section optimization for HE Senj was done to reduce the losses without changing the bar spacing (which was proved to be valid during exploitation). As it was mentioned in [19,20] head loss reduction due to cross section change enables reduction in bar spacing, but that must be carefully evaluated due to its influence on other criteria such as structural aspect, debris accumulation, vibrations and velocity filed that can influence the fish movement. With new innovative designs, such as V-shaped trash-rack [23] optimization value becomes more prominent because it can reduce the time necessary for conducting experiments that vary different geometry parameters. Also, since vortex shedding that influences vibrations and can cause damages to trash-rack structure is known for standard trash-rack design, when considering new innovative designs this aspect must also be taken into consideration. More detailed numerical analysis (LES) of unsteady fluid behaviour should be conducted [16] with encompassing structural (FEM) numerical analysis [17].\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, the influence of trash-rack and bar geometry on head losses is examined. Validation of numerical results is conducted with experimental results from previous studies. A numerical investigation of four bar cross sections for nine different trash-rack configurations, where trash-rack and bar inclinations are varied, is performed. Additionally, optimization of trash-rack bar cross section is conducted using the PSO algorithm.\nFor a given experiment, where the channel cross section is constant along the vertical axis, similar results are obtained with 3D multiphase, 3D single phase and 2D simulations. Since difference in 2D and 3D results were around 1%, 2D simulations are conducted for all considered cases to save computational time. For greatest bar (90\n\n\u00b0\n\n) and trash-rack (45\n\n\u00b0\n\n) inclinations greatest variation in the result is observed with numerical simulation underestimating head loss coefficient by 15%. Rectangular cross section, which is mainly present in turbine intakes, causes the greatest head loss for almost all configurations which suggests there is an area for improvement in current designs. For greater bar and trash-rack inclinations greater turbulence zones can be observed which cause greater head loss coefficient. Also, in case of low-head turbines where the turbine is positioned rather close to the trash-rack, the non-uniformity of flow may cause a reduction of turbine efficiency. For these configurations influence of cross section is greater than for configurations with smaller inclinations. Optimization conducted for trash-rack perpendicular and bars parallel to fluid flow, generated geometry with minimal bar cross section area.\nIn future work, possibilities of optimization should be explored and validated with the experiment. Optimization can be conducted for real intake geometries where the influence of channel before and after trash-rack should also be also included. To decide on the optimal cross section, apart from head losses, other flow field parameters which influence the fish behaviour near trash-rack can be included in the optimization goal function to encompass both ecological and engineering approach. Construction and stability aspect must also be taken into consideration, where constraints or penalties for designs that induce vibrations that could lead to construction failure should be included. Currently this optimization procedure would include expensive goal function evaluation since it would include both LES simulation and structural (FEM) numerical analysis, but with growing computational power it would provide comprehensive study of trash-rack design.\n\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1396":"\n\nIntroduction\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease driven mainly by self-reactive T helper (Th) cells with characteristic foci of inflammation and demyelination in brain, spinal cord and optic nerve [1]. In most cases, MS follows a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) with subacute episodes of neurological symptoms followed by recovery. By time, some patients with RRMS shift into secondary progressive form of the disease [1]. To date, biochemical markers that might provide objective criteria to confirm or rule out diagnosis of MS are lacking, making MS a difficult disease to diagnose and treat. Moreover, the clinical progression of MS is highly variable, and predicting prognosis is quite challenging. Hence, enhanced understanding of MS pathogenesis and progression would aid in the early detection and the optimal disease management [2].\nAlthough brainis one of themost lipid-rich organs in the body, the derangements of lipid metabolism in MS have not yet been properly investigated [3]. Based on the chronic inflammatory character of MS and the anti-inflammatory role of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), it remains necessary to know how lipoproteins metabolism influences MS activity and progression [4]. Thus, a better understanding of HDL in MS may help to explain the variability of MS course and may unveil new therapeutic targets tailored specifically for MS patients [4]. Apoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a major proteincomponentof HDL, is a constitutive anti-inflammatory molecule in many biological processes [5], where it is believed to block interactions of macrophages with T-cells, resulting in reduction of Th1 and Th17 cytokines [6]. The main proinflammatory T-cell populations associated with MS, are the Th1 that secretes interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1) in addition to the Th17 that secretes interleukin (IL)17, IL21, and IL22 [7]. ApoA1 also plays a pivotal role in healing and neuronal regeneration [8]. Therefore, studying the control of ApoA1 expression during periods of inflammation could provide important information about the mechanisms of HDL regulation and its role in MS pathogenesis.\nLately, long noncoding (lnc) RNAs are increasingly appreciated for their involvement in epigenetic regulation of MS pathogenesis [9]. An endogenously expressed antisense lncRNA molecule, APOA1-AS, was identified as a negative transcriptional regulator of ApoA1 both in vivo and in vitro\n[10]\n. Thus, studying ApoA1 and APOA1-AS might provide valuable insights into the role of HDL in MS activity and progression. Two other lncRNAs were also addressed in this study, the first being lncRNA IFNG-AS1, that is specifically expressed by the Th1 subset and is necessary for active transcription and expression of IFN-\u03b3 in Th1 cells [11]. Another cell-intrinsic cue contributing to production of Th17 cytokines during both homeostasis and inflammation is lncRNA RMRP. RMRP is the RNA component of the mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease (RNase MRP), which is essential for regulating a subset of critical genes implicated specifically in the Th17 effector program [12].\nAnother point of interest is sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lysophospholipid constituting an active part of HDL composition. S1P is generated in the central nervous system (CNS) by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 (SPHK1 and 2) [13]. Upon release, S1P activates a family of G protein-coupled receptors (S1PR1-5) to induce different cell responses [14]. The \u201cinside-out\u201d signaling by S1P plays a role in many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including MS. Increased S1P levels were observed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of RRMS patients during relapses and increased CSF levels of S1P was associated with disability in MS patients [15].\nIn this context, the aim of this study was designed to investigate the epigenetic machinery regulating ApoA1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL17 levels by measuring the expression levels of three related lncRNAs; APOA1-AS, IFNG-AS1, and RMRP. Additionally, gene expression of SPHK1 & 2 and S1PR1 & 5 was measured. Furthermore, the impact of these parameters on MS activity, future progression and patient disability was also evaluated. Finally, the potential use of these biomarkers as novel non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools for MS was also assessed.\n\n\nSubjects and methods\n\nParticipants\nThis study included 100 participants, 28 healthy controls and 72 MS patients recruited from Kasr Al-Ainy Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit (KAMSU) at Cairo University Hospitals, Egypt, between October 2017 and March 2018. A confirmed clinical diagnosis was performed by a neurologist according to the 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria [16]. In this study, 37 RRMS patients were in relapse (acute or worsening of a neurologic deficit that lasts at least 24\u202fh and separated from a previous attack by at least 30\u202fdays in absence of fever and infection) [16]. Patients with relapses were assessed within 7\u202fdays from onset and samples were obtained before methylprednisolone therapy. Whereas, 35 RRMS patients were in clinical remission (relapse-free for at least 90\u202fdays before sample collection) [16]. Exclusionary criteria included: pregnancy, current or recent inflammatory or infectious diseases, familial hypercholesterolemia, lipid-lowering drugs or steroid intake one month prior to enrollment. As regards the controls, 28 age and sex-matched healthy individuals volunteered to participate in the study without any diagnostic criteria of MS and free of neurological and autoimmune diseases. All participants gave written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee for experimental and clinical studies at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt (approval number: BC 1956) and conformed to the 1975 Helsinki declaration, revised in 2008.\nPrediction of future progression in MS course can be inspected in terms of increased annualized relapse rate (ARR) [17]. ARR is the number of confirmed relapses experienced by the patient in one year, herein ARR in the past 2\u202fyears was calculated for each patient [18]. Meanwhile, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to evaluate neurological disability and assess clinical severity [19]. Accordingly, both relapse and remission groups were sub-divided according to their:\n\n1.\nARR, into two groups: low ARR group (<1) and high ARR group (\u22651).\n\n\n2.\nEDSS score, into ambulatory patients (EDSS <\u202f6) and assisted or non-ambulatory group (EDSS\u202f\u2265\u202f6).\n\n\n\n\n\nSample collection and biochemical measurements\nWhole venous blood samples were collected into vacuette collection tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 15\u202fmin and the buffy coats were collected and instantly used for total RNA extraction. The separated plasma was aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u202f\u00b0C.\nPlasma IL17 and IFN-\u03b3 were measured by Quantikine HS ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and expressed as picograms per milliliter. Postprandial plasma levels of ApoA1 were measured using commercial sandwich ELISA kit (NOVA, Beijing, China) and expressed as nanogram per milliliter, whereas total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by enzymatic spectrophotometric methods, while HDL-cholesterol was determined by precipitant method using commercially available kits. Finally, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations were estimated by Friedewald\u2019s formula [20].\n\n\nTotal RNA isolation and qRT-PCR\nLong noncoding RNA expression levels of APOA1-AS, IFNG-AS1, and RMRP together with gene expression levels of SPHK1, SPHK2, S1PR1, and S1PR5, were assessed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\nTotal RNA was extracted from the buffy coats using TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). The RNA concentration and quality were assessed using Q5000 UV\u2013Vis Spectrophotometer nanodrop (Quawell, San Jose, USA).\nComplementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA recovered on the same day using Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gene expression was measured using StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) and Maxima SYBR Green\/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA). The primers used were pre-designed using NCBI primer Blast and verified by in-silico PCR tool of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser, and eventually custom-made by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a housekeeping reference gene. The primers were listed in Table 1\n. The cycle threshold (CT) values were normalized using GAPDH as endogenous control, then they were represented relative to the healthy control values, where the changes in target expression were calculated using \u0394\u0394CT method and presented as fold change (FC\u202f=\u202f\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n-\n\u0394\n\u0394\nC\nT\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll measured parameters were subjected to normality testing using Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test. Experimental data were depicted as mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) or median, interquartile range (IQR) and range whenever appropriate. Categorical data were represented by frequency and percentage. Continuous, normally distributed datasets were analyzed for significance using unpaired Student\u2019s two-tailed t-tests and ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test; for non-parametric data, Mann Whitney or Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test were used. Categorical data were compared by Chi-square test or Fischer exact test. For receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC), Youden\u2019s index and optimal cut-off values were calculated. MS group was compared to healthy controls to assess the diagnostic power of our parameters, whereas relapse values were compared to remission values as the reference standard to assess the prognostic power of measured parameters. In all cases, probabilities of less than 0.05 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) were considered statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval. All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software).\n\n\n\nResults\nThe demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients and healthy controls are summarized in table 2\n.\n\nApoprotein A1 and APOA1-AS in MS and their relation to disease activity, relapse rate, and patient disability\nAs shown in Fig. 1\nA, RRMS patients showed significantly lower levels of plasma ApoA1 and HDL-cholesterol along with higher LDL-cholesterol compared to control values (Fig. 1A). Whereas, their APOA1-AS expression was dramatically upregulated reaching six fold of healthy control values (Fig. 1B).\nOn considering disease activity, plasma ApoA1 levels were significantly lower in patients during active relapses than in remission, while its plasma level in remission was comparable to that of healthy control values (Fig. 2\nA). Meanwhile, plasma HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in patients during relapses and in remission than control values. However, plasma LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher in both relapse and remission groups compared to controls (Fig. 2A). APOA1-AS was significantly upregulated in patients during relapse and in remission when compared to healthy controls (Fig. 2B).\nBy stratifying both relapse and remission groups according to ARR, only ApoA1 levels were significantly lower in patients during relapse with high ARR (\n\n\u2265\n\n1) compared to those in remission with high ARR (\n\n\u2265\n\n1) (Table 3\n). Again, based on EDSS as a measure of disability, ApoA1 levels were significantly lower in ambulatory patients (EDSS\u202f<\u202f6) particularly during relapse than those with the same disability level in remission (Table 4\n).\n\n\nInterferon-\u03b3 and interleukin 17 in MS and their relation to disease activity, relapse rate, and patient disability\nIn MS patients, both plasma IFN-\u03b3 levels and IFNG-AS1 expression were markedly increased reaching about 3.5 and 5 fold of the control values (Fig. 1A and B). Likewise, plasma IL17 concentrations in patients were nearly 2.5 fold of healthy control levels, however, RMRP expression showed insignificant increase (Fig. 1A and B).\nRegarding their impact on disease activity, plasma IFN-\u03b3 and IL17, as well as the expression of IFNG-AS1, were significantly higher in patients during relapse and in remission than controls. However, only plasma levels of IL17 were significantly higher in patients during relapse than those in remission (Fig. 2A and B).\nBased on ARR values, patients with high ARR (\n\n\u2265\n\n1) showed lower IFN-\u03b3 levels than those with low ARR (<1). At low ARR (<1), patients during relapse showed significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 levels than those in remission, whereas, at high ARR (\n\n\u2265\n\n1), patients in remission had lower plasma IL17 levels than those during relapse (Table 3). According to EDSS scores, assisted or non-ambulatory patients (EDSS \n\n\u2265\n\n6\n\n) during relapse and in remission showed significantly lower IFN-\u03b3 concentrations than ambulatory (EDSS\u202f<\u202f6) patients. On the other hand, plasma IL17 levels were significantly higher in patients with low and high EDSS during relapse than the corresponding patients in remission (Table 4).\n\n\nSphingosine kinases and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors in MS and their relation to disease activity, relapse rate, and patient disability\nRRMS patients showed a dramatic upregulation of SPHK1 and SPHK2 expressions reaching about 26 and 7 fold of healthy control values respectively. Moreover, patients showed a 2-fold increase in S1PR5 expression compared to control levels, without any significant change in S1PR1 expression (Fig. 1C).\nIn terms of disease activity, SPHK1 & 2, as well as S1PR5 expressions, were significantly upregulated in both relapse and remission groups compared to control values. Only patients during relapse showed significantly higher expression of S1PR1 compared to healthy controls. Noticeably, SPHK2 expression was significantly lower in patients during relapse than those in remission (Fig. 2C).\nARR stratification showed that patients during relapse with low ARR (<1) had significantly downregulated expression of SPHK1, S1PR1 and 5, compared to corresponding patients in remission (Table 3). EDSS stratification showed a significantly lower expression level of SPHK2 and S1PR1 in ambulatory patients (EDSS\u202f<\u202f6) during relapse, compared to ambulatory patients (EDSS\u202f<\u202f6) in remission. In relapse group, the assisted or non-ambulatory patients (EDSS \n\n\u2265\n\n6\n\n) had significantly higher S1PR1 expression than ambulatory patients (EDSS\u202f<\u202f6) (Table 4).\n\n\nDiagnostic potential of the studied parameters\nROC curve analysis showed a rather good diagnostic performance for APOA1-AS followed by ApoA1; where the AUCs were 0.82 and 0.74 respectively. Interestingly, the diagnostic power of SPHK1 was superior to SPHK2, S1PR1, and S1PR5, with an AUC value of 0.89. An excellent diagnostic performance was noticed for IFN-\u03b3 (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.97) and IL17 (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.91) (Fig. 3\n and Table 5\n).\n\n\nPrognostic potential of the studied parameters\nBoth ApoA1 and APOA1-AS were comparable in their prognostic performance to discriminate RRMS patients during active relapses from those in remission; ApoA1 had an AUC of 0.71 and APOA1-AS had an AUC of 0.71. Similarly, both IFNG-AS1 and IL17 exhibited good discriminative powers with AUC of 0.75 for IFNG-AS1 and AUC of 0.72 for IL17. However, the best prognostic potential was given by SPHK2 with an AUC value of 0.83 (Fig. 3 and Table 5).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe current study reported the differential expression of three lncRNAs: APOA1-AS, IFNG-AS1, and RMRP besides the differential gene expression of SPHK1, SPHK2, S1PR1 and S1PR5 in a cohort of MS patients. We aim to objectively elucidate a framework for the involvement of three intermingled axes in MS pathogenesis along with their possible links to MS activity, relapse rate, and patient disability.\nApoA1, the main constitutive protein in HDL, was reported to be neuroprotective in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [21]. Recently, lncRNA APOA1-AS, an endogenous regulator of ApoA1 biogenesis, has gained much interest. In this report, MS patients showed a marked upregulation in APOA1-AS along with lower levels of ApoA1 and HDL-cholesterol, together with higher LDL-cholesterol. APOA1-AS recruits histone-modifying enzymes, known to epigenetically repress ApoA1 promoter, thus reducing ApoA1 transcription [10]. To date, no study has characterized APOA1-AS role in MS or any other neurodegenerative diseases. However, decreased levels of ApoA1 were demonstrated in MS [21], and other neurodegenerative diseases [22].\nHDL exhibits anti-inflammatory effects through managing cholesterol efflux [4]. RRMS patients displayed a distorted lipoprotein profile in which HDL was functionally and structurally modified at ApoA1 site compromising its anti-inflammatory capacity [4]. In our study, plasma ApoA1 was lower during relapse than in remission. In fact, reduction of HDL-cholesterol and ApoA1 had been linked to increased activity in other autoimmune diseases [23]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to describe divergences in ApoA1 reflecting MS activity.\nAccumulation of permanent neurological deficits following relapses promote MS progression, therefore ARR has been used to predict future MS progression [17]. In this report, MS patients during relapse with low ARR showed lower ApoA1 concentration than those in remission, suggesting association between ApoA1 levels and MS progression. Such finding agrees with a previous report in which ApoA1-deficient mice experienced exacerbated EAE upon induction, which was attributed to increased inflammatory cytokines including: TNF-\u03b1 and IL23 [21]. The link between reduced ApoA1 and both MS activity and future progression seemed to be attributed to the loss of the neuro-regenerative power of ApoA1 [8].\nThe EDSS is the most commonly used scale for measuring severity of disability among MS patients [24]. Herein, ambulating patients of relapse group showed lower ApoA1 concentrations than those in remission, confirming ApoA1 power to discriminate MS relapses from remission especially at lower EDSS. In fact, ApoA1 has been used as a biomarker for some neurodegenerative diseases [25]. Herein, even though APOA1-AS had shown greater diagnostic ability than ApoA1, both were comparable in predicting MS activity.\nConcurrent upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 and IFNG-AS1 was observed in different autoimmune diseases [11]. In this study, IFNG-AS1 upregulation and higher IFN-\u03b3 levels were found in RRMS patients. Several studies reported elevated IFN-\u03b3 in MS patients [26]. In fact, the role of IFN-\u03b3 in MS has been an enigmatic paradox, since some studies confirmed a prominent proinflammatory role, while others showed a protective function in MS [27]. Increased production of IFN-\u03b3 in CNS has been suggested to increase expression of class II antigens and enhance myelin antigen presentation to sensitized T cells, which can initiate MS or exacerbate present symptoms [28].\nTh17 cells are involved in triggering and maintaining tissue damage in chronic neuroinflammation [29]. Herein, IL17 increased in MS patients, which is consistent with previous reports [30]. IL17 can induce glial activation, IL6, and IL1\u03b2 expression, as well as nitric oxide release from astrocytes and microglia, that can inflect direct toxicity to myelin and exposed axons [1]. RMRP, a critical regulator of Th17 function, was identified in tissue cultures and animal models of autoimmunity, where decreased RMRP levels caused a reduction in IL17 [31]. Herein, RMRP expression was assessed in peripheral blood of MS patients for the first time and showed statistically insignificant increased levels.\nIn this investigation, insignificant changes in IFN-\u03b3, IFNG-AS, and RMRP were observed between relapse and remission groups, however, MS patients during relapses exhibited higher IL17 level, suggesting possible relation between IL17 and MS activity. A concurrent increase in Th17 cells and IL17 levels in CSF and serum of MS patients during relapse was previously reported [30]. Interestingly, our results revealed elevated IL17 in patients during relapses with both low and high EDSS scores. Such findings confirm the involvement of IL17 in relapses irrespective to severity of disability. Likewise, at high ARR, IL17 was elevated in relapse compared to remission, suggesting IL17 as a potential predictor for relapses especially in MS patients with high ARR.\nIn our study, MS patients during relapse and in remission with higher EDSS showed lower IFN-\u03b3. Similarly, patients with high ARR exhibited lower IFN-\u03b3 than those with low ARR, revealing an association between IFN-\u03b3 and both EDSS and ARR. Contradictory functions of INF-\u03b3 was demonstrated in EAE [32]. Moreover, a stage-specific role for IFN-\u03b3 in EAE and MS was reported [27]. Therefore, further studies are needed to clearly track IFN-\u03b3 over MS course. In our study, ROC curve analysis showed excellent diagnostic power of IFN-\u03b3 and IL17 for MS.\nHerein, SPHK1, SPHK2, and S1PR5 were upregulated in MS together with insignificant S1PR1 upregulation. Importantly, SPHK1 is highly enriched in nerve terminals, where it stimulates oligodendrocyte progenitor survival [33]. Despite the absence of reports describing SPHKs expression in blood of MS patients, our findings are in accordance with SPHK1 upregulation found on reactive astrocytes and macrophages isolated from MS lesions, in addition to marked increase in SPHK1 expression and functionality in activated rat astrocytes [34]. SPHK2, on the other hand, regulates histone acetylation, hence epigenetically controls the expression of genes involved in pro- or anti-inflammatory pathways depending on the surrounding environment [35]. Therefore, we speculate that SPHK2 upregulation observed herein is related to the altered inflammatory milieu and apoptotic oligodendrocyte loss in MS patients.\nHuman S1PRs expression in the CNS is quite obscure, especially in pathological conditions [36]. In fact, reports demonstrated S1PRs expression in rodents\u2019 or human brain cells [36], yet data about S1PRs expression in blood of MS patients are still lacking. In this study, the insignificant S1PR1 upregulation agrees with a study reporting S1PR1 upregulation in active and inactive MS lesions [36]. Modulating S1PR5 in human oligodendrocytes is essential for survival [37], thus, S1PR5 upregulation observed herein might represent a compensatory mechanism related to failed remyelination accompanying MS, however further studies are required to validate such assumption.\nHerein, MS patients during relapse exhibited lower SPHK2 expression than those in remission. Based on EDSS, only ambulatory patients during relapse showed lower SPHK2 expression. Such findings raise a possibility that downregulation of SPHK2 might be involved in MS relapses especially in patients with low EDSS.\nEven though S1PR1 was insignificantly upregulated in MS patients, it was significantly upregulated in relapse group particularly in assisted or non-ambulatory patients, suggesting that S1PR1 expression can be a useful predictor for future worsening of disability during relapses. Additionally, based on ARR, patients in remission with low ARR showed upregulated SPHK1, S1PR1, and S1PR5. Such observation complies with the role of S1P in augmenting repair processes [38] and supporting remyelination in MS [39]. On conducting ROC analysis, SPHK1 showed good diagnostic power, whereas SPHK2 showed sufficient prognostic ability. Such differences in discriminative power could be related to the difference in their intracellular location [40]. Our data may suggest a crucial role for SPHK1 in MS pathogenesis while the role of SPHK2 might emerge during active MS.\nFinally, this report has some limitations, firstly, being a single-center study, which necessitates comparable multi-centered studies to obtain more data and compare outcomes. Another caveat is the relatively small sample size in some subgroups. Further studies with larger multi-centered cohorts are recommended. Additionally, reports investigating longitudinal samples should be considered to monitor progression within MS patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, this study demonstrated upregulation of lncRNAs APOA1-AS and IFNG-AS1 but not RMRP along with overexpression of SPHK1, SPHK2 and S1PR5 genes in blood of Egyptian MS patients. Moreover, significant differences in ApoA1, SPHK2, and IL17 were found between patients during relapse and those in remission. Our findings also linked ApoA1, SPHK2, and IL17 to MS activity, and both S1PR1 and IFN-\u03b3 to patient disability. However, only IFN-\u03b3 was associated with relapse rate and consequently future progression in MS. Finally, our study provides evidence for excellent diagnostic power of IFN-\u03b3, IL17, SPHK1 and lncRNA APOA1-AS in differentiating MS patients, whereas SPHK2 showed the highest prognostic power in predicting MS patients in relapses.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\nAll procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration if 1975, as revised in 2008 (5).

The prevalence of OI is 6-7\/100,000 [1]. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive manner. Alterations in at least 18 genes have been associated with OI [1,2]. Mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, which encode the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chain of type I collagen, account for more than 85% of disease-causing variants. Glycine substitutions within the Gly-X-Y repeats of collagen chains are the most common type of mutations leading to abnormal collagen structure [1].\nCombined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) is a condition in which the pituitary gland produces insufficient amounts of several hormones, including growth hormone (GH), prolactin production (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and\/or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Its prevalence is 1\/8000 [3]. Up to 2500 variants in 30 genes including PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1, OTX2, GLI2, LHX3, and LHX4 have been associated with CPHD [3]. The LHX4, which is the LIM homeodomain transcription factor, plays an important role in the development of anterior pituitary gland and nervous system. Its expression is found in the Rathke\u2019s pouch. It can regulate POU1F1, GH1, PRL, \u03b1GSU, FSHB, and TSHB genes [4]. To date, only thirteen of LHX4 variants have been investigated for their effects in CPHD [3\u20136].\nA Thai boy manifesting the combined features of OI and CPHD was identified. The study aimed to identify the causative mutations leading to two different Mendelian diseases and to investigate the pathogenicity and pathomechanism of the identified variant causing CPHD.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nPatient characterization and mutation analysis\nA Thai boy diagnosed with both OI and CPHD and his parents were recruited. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB500\/61), Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. Written informed consents for publication of their clinical details and images were obtained from the participants. Genomic DNA isolated from the peripheral blood was subjected for mutation analyses using whole exome sequencing (WES) according to previous publication [7]. The identified variants were validated using Sanger sequencing.\n\n\nPathogenic effect of LHX4 variants\nThe pTracer-LHX4_WT-HA was a gift fromMarie Legendre, France. The LHX4 mutant vectors of p.R122W (the mutation identified in this study) and of two previously reported p.T163P [4] and p.L190R [5] were generated using Q5\u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Three luciferase reporter vectors were selected. The proximal promoter regions of human GH1, POU1F1, or TSHB were amplified and cloned into the pGL4.10[luc2] vector (Supplementary Table 1) [4,5]. Commercial Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (ATCC\u00aeCCL-61TM) were used for transient transfection using X-tremeGENE9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\n\n\nPathomechanism of LHX4 variants\nThe CHO-K1 cells were cotransfected with an equal amount of wild-type and each mutant LHX4. The empty pTracer-CMV expression vector was used as the control. POU1F1 promoter was selected for this experiment. After 48\u202fh, the transcription activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and SpectraMax M3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Total amount of protein was measured by the Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The results of three independent experiments were reported as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD. The P-value was <0.01.\n\n\nWestern blot analyses\nProtein extracted from the cellular lysates of CHO-K1 cells transfected with LHX4 expression vectors were prepared. 20 ug of protein per sample was separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and then transferred by iBlot\u2122 Transfer Stack, PVDF, regular size (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody at 1:250 dilution (cat no. H3663, Sigma-Aldrich, St louis, MO) was used as the primary antibody to detect LHX4-HA proteins, followed by anti-mouse IgG antibody at 1:2000 dilution (cat no. 7076, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) as the secondary antibody. Anti-actin antibody (cat no. Mab1501, Sigma-Aldrich, St louis, MO) was used as a positive control to determine gel loading equivalency. Results were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and chemiluminescence camera (ImageQuant LAS 4000, Amersham).\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPatient characteristics\nA 6-year-old Thai boy was born at 37\u202fweeks by caesarian section due to breech presentation, intrauterine growth retardation, and oligohydramnios. His birth weight was 1,840\u202fg (<3rd centile) and length was 41\u202fcm (<3rd centile). His head circumference was 32\u202fcm (25\u201350th centile). Apgar scores at 1 and 5\u202fmin were 5 and 10, respectively. At birth, the proband exhibited deformed limbs, bowed legs, wide anterior fontanelle (4x4 cm), frontal bossing, and blue sclerae. He also developed neonatal sepsis, seizure, and respiratory distress caused by subcostral retraction and chest wall instability. Fractures of his left humerus and angulation of long bones was radiologically observed (Fig. 1\nA, B). The result of hearing test was normal. Intravenous pamidronate (7.2\u202fmg\/kg\/year) was started at the age of 2\u202fmonths and then administered every 2\u202fmonths. He started to walk unaided at 2\u202fyears of age but showed an abnormal gait. Pectus carinatum and flat feet were observed at the age of 3\u202fyears (Fig. 1C, D). His primary teeth showed dentinogenesis imperfecta and were severely deteriorated (Fig. 1E, F). He broke his right femur at the age of 5\u202fyears 11\u202fmonths and his left femur at 6\u202fyears 2\u202fmonths caused by falls (Fig. 1G, H). Bone density scans showed that his lumbar spine BMD at the age of 19\u202fmonths was 0.343\u202fg\/cm2 (<-3SD) and at the age of 4\u202fyears was 0.491\u202fg\/cm2 (-2SD, +42.9%).\nApart from short stature and bone fragility which are the main features of OI, slow growth velocity was noticed (Fig. 1I). Physical examination of the proband at the age of 3\u202fyears 5\u202fmonths showed that his upper lower body ratio was 1.19:1 and arm span was 72\u202fcm. Further endocrine evaluation revealed that the proband had low level of free thyroxine (FT4) (0.51\u202fng\/dl; normal 1.0\u20131.8). The levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) were in the low end of normal range. Growth hormone (GH) stimulation test showed the peak value of GH at 1.01\u202fng\/ml (normal\u202f>\u202f10). The levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were within normal limit (Table 1\n). Renal function test and blood biochemistry were normal. Brain MRI identified the hypoplastic pituitary gland and stalk and mildly diffused parenchymal volume loss (Fig. 1J, K). Based on the clinical and laboratory investigations, the proband was diagnosed with the deficiencies of growth hormone and thyroid hormone, indicating CPHD. The administration of growth hormone (Norditropin\u00ae 0.3\u202fmg\/day subcutaneously) and thyroid hormone (Eltroxin, 25 ug\/day) was started when he was 3\u202fyears 9\u202fmonths. Since hormonal replacement was initiated, his growth had been improved (Fig. 1L).\nThe proband was the only son of non-consanguineous and healthy Thai parents. They were 31\u202fyears of age when the proband was born. Paternal height was 164.8\u202fcm and maternal height was 159\u202fcm. Physical and dental manifestations of the parents were unremarkable. The proband\u2019s father had normal growth and no infertility problems. His sexual maturity was at Tanner stage V. Endocrine evaluation of the father at age 37\u202fyears showed normal levels of IGF1, FT4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone.\n\n\nMutation analyses\nExome sequencing revealed that the proband possessed a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation, c.1531G\u202f>\u202fT (p.G511C), in COL1A2. The variant was not found in ExAC and our in-house database of 1,876 Thai exomes. Several lines of evidences have supported the pathogenicity of the COL1A2 p.G511C. The variant was 1) de novo which is a strong evidence of its etiologic role, 2) absent from controls in multiple variant databases and in-house database, 3) highly conserved among several species, 4) predicted to be deleterious based on multiple lines of computational evidences, 5) corresponding to the patient\u2019s phenotype for OI, and 6) located in the triple helical domain of alpha 2 chains of type I collagen. According to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the p.G511C variant is considered pathogenic [8]. Changes of glycine, the smallest amino acid, in Gly-X-Y triplets of collagen chain have been shown to disturb triple helical assembly and collagen chain stability [9,10]. These therefore provide compelling evidence that p.G511C in COL1A2 is the causative variant of OI in the proband. In addition, a missense variant, c.364C\u202f>\u202fT (p.R122W), in LHX4 was detected in the proband and his healthy father (Fig. 1M). The p.R122W variant was found in 1 out of 121,208 alleles in ExAC. However, it was not observed in our in-house exome database and had never been reported to cause any diseases. The p.R122W was highly conserved among several species and located in the LIM2 domain of LHX4 (Fig. 1N, O). Both COL1A2 and LHX4 variants were predicted to be deleterious (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant\/SIFT), probably damaging (Polymorphism Phenotyping\/PolyPhen), and possibly pathogenic (Mendelian Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity\/M-CAP). The phenotypic and genotypic findings of the proband lead to the diagnosis of combined OI and CPHD (Fig. 1P). Mutation analyses were demonstrated in Tables 2, 3\n\n.\n\n\nPathogenicity of the LHX4 missense variant, p.R122W\nWestern blotting showed that the wild-type, p.L190R, p.T163P, and p.R122W LHX4 proteins were detected at similar sizes (50\u202fkDa) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The luciferase assays showed that the wild-type LHX4 was able to activate the POU1F1, GH1, and TSHB promoters. In contrast, the luciferase activities of the p.R122W variant and two previously reported mutations, p.T163P and p.L190R, were significantly lower than the wild-type (Fig. 2\nA\u2013C).\n\n\nPathomechanism of the LHX4 missense variant, p.R122W\nCotransfection of wild-type and each mutant LHX4 (p.R112W, p.T163P, and p.L190R) showed comparable luciferase activities to the cotransfection of wild-type LHX4 and empty pTracer-CMV expression vector. These suggest that these LHX4 mutations do not have a dominant negative effect on the wild-type function and they are likely to cause the disease by loss-of-function mechanism (Fig. 2D).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nA Thai boy with the complex phenotypes was identified. His main features including short stature, bone deformity, skeletal fracture, low BMD, blue sclerae, and dentinogenesis imperfecta led to the primary diagnosis of OI. After intravenous pamidronate was administered every 2\u202fmonths, his BMD had increased. However, low height velocity was observed. Further laboratory investigations showing pituitary hypoplasia and deficiencies of GH and TSH indicated the secondary diagnosis of CPHD. These suggest that attentive monitoring a child\u2019s growth benefits an early diagnosis of combined rare diseases. In addition, the replacement therapy with GH apart from IV bisphosphonate results in an increased height velocity for this patient.\nMore than forty OI patients have been identified in our Genetics Clinic of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Those were associated with the mutations in various genes including COL1A1, BMP1, P4HB, WNT1, and MBTPS2\n[2,11\u201313]. In the proband, WES analysis revealed the novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation, c.1531G\u202f>\u202fT (p.G511C), in COL1A2, corresponding to OI. This COL1A2 variant was not found in his healthy parents. Glycine is considered to be the smallest amino acid allowing it to be incorporated in the triple helix structure of collagen. Therefore, the change of glycine to cysteine is expected to impede the folding and formation of collagen resulting in abnormal collagen structure.\nThe complex phenotype of the proband was unexplainable by the single mutation in COL1A2. He was the only one out of our 40 Thai OI patients that exhibited CPHD features. Further genetic investigation revealed that the proband also possessed the heterozygous missense mutation, c.364C\u202f>\u202fT(p.R122W), in LHX4, which was inherited from his healthy father. Interestingly, the mutations in LHX4 causing CPHD have been reported with a high rate of incomplete penetrance [4,14]. The pathogenicity of LHX4 variant, p.R122W, was then investigated. The p.R122W was predicted to be deleterious and located in the highly conserved LIM2 domain playing important role in protein-protein interactions [15]. Using the luciferase reporter assays, the LHX4 p.R122W was shown to lose its ability to activate POU1F1, GH1, and TSHB promoters, validating its pathogenicity. These explain the deficiencies of GH and TSH found in the proband. Western blot analyses showed that the wild-type and mutant LHX4 proteins of expected size (50\u202fkDa) were detected. The level of expression of p.R122W was lower than that of the wild-type. However, this might not be the cause for its low level of luciferase activity as the control mutants that were expressed at higher levels also showed low activities. Next, the pathomechanism study of p.R122W showed that it did not interfere with the function of wild-type LHX4, similar to the other two LHX4 mutations, L190R and T163P. These indicate that it possesses loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency mechanism rather than dominant negative effect in CPHD. Notably, LHX4 has been proposed to have random monoallelic expression [16]. The single expression of normal LHX4 allele could therefore explain the absence of disease in the proband\u2019s father who also carries the heterozygous p.R122W variant.\nPatients with mutations in two genes leading to clinical manifestations of two or more Mendelian disorders are not uncommon. Recently, it was reported that these patients accounted for five percent of individuals with informative exome [17].\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated the first patient with combined OI and CPHD. While OI was caused by the de novo heterozygous COL1A2 mutation, CPHD was by the heterozygous LHX4 mutation inherited from the healthy father. The incomplete penetrance and loss-of-function are the characteristics of p.R122W mutation in LHX4. This study expands the mutation spectra of COL1A2 and LHX4 and demonstrates the pathogenicity of the LHX4 p.R122W mutation. We propose here that exome sequencing could be a promising tool to discover pathogenic variants for complex phenotypes leading to precise diagnosis of combined disorders.\n\n\nCompliance with ethics requirements\nAll procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008 (5).

Standard radio- and chemotherapy regimens are not much effective strategies in improving survival of patients with metastatic disease. A significant advance in the treatment of metastatic RCC has been made in the last decade through the inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor (VEGFR), and the mTOR pathway [1]. Likewise, new therapeutic approaches focusing on the tumor microenvironment are being implemented in the last years. In this sense, the blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) in intratumor inflammatory cells is showing promising results in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCC) [2]. Following the idea of targeting not only the neoplastic cells themselves but also the accompanying elements taking part of a tumor, the focus is being also directed against other non-neoplastic cellular compartment: the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF).\nThis paper reviews the role of CAF in renal cell carcinomas and analyzes the clinical relevance of FAP expression in these neoplasms.\n\n\nCancer-associated fibroblasts. An overview\nFibroblast activation is a common process in tissues under diverse conditions, for example, in response to injury. During their activation, fibroblasts undergo a phenotypic transformation migrating to the injured area. Once they complete their mission, the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) triggers their apoptosis [3]. Tumors, presumably by epigenetic mechanisms, induce the chronic activation of local fibroblasts, a subgroup of cells collectively known as CAF [4]. These cells are characterized by the expression of a subset of proteins such as \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), the classic marker of activated fibroblasts, fibroblast specific protein-1, also known as S100A4, desmin and FAP [5], among others. To note, the expression of these proteins is not limited to CAF and their distribution is not homogeneous [6]. This heterogeneity of CAF population can be attributed, at least in part, to their different origins. The main source of CAF is the activation of resident precursors within the tumor [7]. However, endothelial and epithelial cells can undergo endothelial\/epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT\/EMT) process and become CAF [8,9]. Bone marrow fibrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells are also a source of CAF [10,11]. Even pericytes, adipocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells have been described to transform in CAF under appropriate conditions [12]. Thus, although the origin of CAF has been widely reviewed in bibliography, still remains as a controversial issue [13,4,14]. Together with the origin cell type, the activation is also a complex process in which different cytokines, growth factor, miRNAs and even exosomes are involved [15,16].\nAlthough CAF and tumor cells develop a local symbiotic relationship governed by the rules of Ecology [17], the specific functions of CAF in tumorigenesis are still not well understood. Both protumor and antitumor effects have been described in these cells supporting the idea that some type of cellular specialization must occur under pressures already unknown [18\u201320]. More specifically, main CAF actions have been related to hallmarks of cancer biology purposed by Hanahan and Weinberg in the beginning of the century and actualized a decade later [21,22]. For example, they regulate tumor development stages secreting cytokines and growth factors such as VEGF, FGF-2 or SDF-1\u03b1 and altering the extracellular matrix composition to regulate tumor growth promoting angiogenesis and invasive phenotypes [23]. CAF also have the capacity to reprogram tumor cell metabolism and immunosuppressive effects. For example, by CAF\/tumor cell contact, CAF undergo Warburg metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress while tumor cells reprogram toward aerobic metabolism in a process strictly regulated by the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1). This way cancer cells lose glucose dependence and increase the lactate upload to drive anabolic pathways and in consequence, cell growth [24]. Regarding immunosuppression, Harper and Sainson reviewed direct (by the creation of an inflammatory signature with immunosuppressive function on both adaptive and innate white blood cells) and indirect effects (by the regulation of the stiffness, angiogenesis, hypoxia and metabolism) of CAF to regulate the antitumor immune response [25]. Drug resistance is another crucial factor during tumorigenesis. TME and primarily CAF have a determinant role in drug resistance by both cell adhesion mediated drug resistance and soluble factor mediated drug resistance [26].\nConsidering the comprehensive role of CAF in tumor development described above, several attempts have been developed to target this stromal population [5]. Inhibitors of CAF specific proteins, prodrugs activated only by CAF and even vaccines to target CAF have been designed, however, all of them have been unsuccessful to date. The identification of biomarkers that may allow distinguishing different CAF subgroups with specific actions would open up new possibilities in this research area.\n\n\nRenal cell carcinoma. A model of tumor\/non tumor cell interaction\nRCC is a complex group of tumors originating from diverse epithelial cells of the kidney tubules. The World Health Organization describes more than 15 different histologic subtypes accounting for more than 95% of tumors in the adult kidney [27]. In 2018, kidney tumors represented 2.2% of all cancers, with more than 400,000 cases diagnosed worldwide [28]. These figures make RCC a health problem of major concern. These tumors are more frequent on male population with a 2:1 ratio, and the incidence is much higher in developed countries [29]. Although nomograms and models composed by the sum of different prognostic factors like UISS (UCLA Integrated Staging System) and SSIGN (Stage, Size, Grade and Necrosis) [30] have optimized patient prognosis, only surgery impacts significantly in patient survival. However, about a third of patients who have undergone curative surgery will relapse over time. Targeted therapies such as VEGF\/VEGFR and mTOR inhibitors, and immunotherapy, have had promising results improving significantly the survival in selected patients with advanced disease [1] Indeed, sunitinib became first line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) since in 2007 was probed that it duplicates patient progression free survival from 5 to 11\u202fmonths in comparison of previous treatments [31]. mTOR inhibitors extends this period allowing disease control [32]. Recently, the resurgence of immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab or ipilimumab have changed the standard of care of mRCC. Motzer et al. demonstrated in a study with more than 1000 patients that overall survival and response rate were significantly higher in patients with nivolumab\/ipilimumab treatment than with sunitinib [33]. Actually the efforts are focused in the assessment of the combination and sequence of both therapies that will optimize patient benefit [34].\nCAF have a protumor effect in RCC. In 2015, Xu et al. [35], showed in vitro that CAF are involved in tumor progression. These authors demonstrated in CAF\/tumor cell co-cultures that CAF were implicated in tumor cell proliferation and migration, as well as in the development of mTOR inhibitors resistance [35]. Together with CAF, immune cells such as Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAM) have been suggested to mediate mTOR targeting resistance [36], although there is still no evidence in RCC. Also, CAF seem to have a role in early phases of CCRCC development through its relationship with hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1) (see Graphical Abstract). The accumulation of this protein is the consequence of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene malfunction, a driver event in CCRCC [37].\nAccumulation of hypoxia inducible factors, induce the expression of a set of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2). Together, these factors induce the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts and other components of TME such as macrophages. Interactions between these different cell types generate the remodeling of the ECM, a key phenomenon for tumor development and metastasis [38]. Although all these specific mechanisms haven\u2019t been described in RCC yet, expression of cited cytokines has been related to worse overall survival in RCC suggesting their protumor role [39,40]. Primarily FGF-2, which\u2019s expression in the invasion front correlated with RCC aggressiveness, where CAF develop key functions [40].\nZagzag et al.\n[41] demonstrated that the loss of function of VHL gene induced the signaling of stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) through its receptor CXCR4 and described it as a new angiogenic pathway. The expression of SDF-1\/CXCR4 by different cellular components of CCRCCs, including CAF, suggests a paracrine signaling which would increase the expression of the receptor and its ligand under hypoxic conditions [41]. SDF-1\/CXCR4 signaling has been proved to affect angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance by the communication of tumor cells with TME [42]. In RCC in particular, CXCR4 upregulation, a direct effect of HIF 1\u03b1 accumulation, correlated with metastatic ability and was detected in RCC circulating cells of mRCC patients. These evidences suggest that the SDF-1\/CXCR4 biological axis is a main regulator of organ-specific metastases in CCRCC and set out the potential of targeting this signaling pathway [43].\nHowever, the influence of CAF in CCRCC goes further than VHL malfunction (Table 1\n). An in vivo RCC model showed that the chemokine CCL3 and its specific receptor CCR5 play a key role in the intratumor accumulation of CAF and other inflammatory cells such as granulocytes or macrophages [44]. Consequently, CAF increased the expression of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a major angiogenic factor, and also the MMP-9 accumulation, this way contributing to the development of tumor metastasis [44].\nThe symbiotic relationship between tumor cells and CAF is illustrated by the upregulation of stromal periostin (PN) detected in CCRCC [45]. This adhesion protein secreted in the ECM has been detected in many cancers and has been related to cell motility, invasion and EMT processes. In vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that tumor RCC cells induce the expression of PN by stromal cells [46]. Furthermore, the expression of PN is located in the boundary region between the xenograft tumor mass and the non-tumor tissue. Such expression is coincident with \u03b1-SMA expression, the classic marker of activated fibroblasts, both in primary and metastatic CCRCC. Functionally, PN enhances significantly CCRCC cell line attachment, NIH3T3 cell proliferation, and AKT activation [45].\nAll in all, the studies analyzed above demonstrate the implication of CAF in proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis development and drug resistance during RCC tumorigenesis. This fact has postulated CAF as potential clinical tools for RCC diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Several interstitial collagenases, which are mainly secreted by CAF [47], have demonstrated to have prognostic relevance in some neoplasms. The expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, for example, have been correlated with tumor progression in a wide variety of neoplasms, included RCC [48,49].\nOn the other hand, the expression of Fer, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, in stromal cells, including fibroblasts and immune cells, correlated with a better prognosis in RCC [50]. This finding contrasts with Fer expression in tumor cells, where it has been linked with tumor aggressiveness and shorter survivals [51]. Fer expression in the stroma has been associated with a lower intra-tumor macrophage density (measured by CD68+ expressing cells) and correlated positively with CD57+ cell density, a common marker of NK cells in humans. Overall, these results suggest that stromal Fer may act as a suppressor of tumor progression in RCC although the clarification of the specific mechanisms involved in this process is unclear.\nGupta et al.\n[52] developed a fibroblast-derived ECM based on a 3D culture model to assess the clinical relevance of stromal markers in combination with their analysis in pathologic specimens. The authors concluded that palladin was a useful biomarker of poor prognosis in non-metastatic RCC [52]. In addition, they suggested that the assessment of stromal progression could be added to tumor stage as a useful clinical prognostic variable since stromal transformation not always correlates with tumor stage [52]. The authors remarked the usefulness of 3D culture models as surrogates of in vivo models, considering their capacity to mimic them by the increase of stromal markers as \u03b1-SMA, palladin and urokinase receptor associated protein [52].\nThe usefulness of FAP as a biomarker in CCRCC has been described recently [53,54]. FAP is a transmembrane serine protease expressed by CAF in epithelial tumors originated in a wide variety of tissues [55]. Although the specific actions of this protease remain unclear, a relationship with the urokinase-mediated plasminogen activation system has been observed. Actually, FAP may form protein complexes with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), its main substrate being \u03b12-antiplasmin [56]. uPAR has been closely related to an aggressive behavior in cancer and has been proposed as a potential new therapeutic target [57].\nThe immunohistochemical expression of FAP in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples (see Fig. 1\n) correlated with high tumor diameter, high grade and high stage in a series of 208 CCRCC [53]. Furthermore, this protein was a strong predictor of aggressiveness, the survival rate of patients with FAP positive tumors being significantly lower [53]. Another study analyzing 59 CCRCC and their paired metastases showed a correlation between FAP expression in CAF and histological parameters of aggressive behavior like necrosis and sarcomatous phenotype [54]. Furthermore, FAP expression in primary CCRCC was associated with the development of synchronous lymph node metastases [54].\nFAP positive cells have been described as SDF-1 synthesizers. In fact, the induction of SDF-1 expression by FAP+ CAF has been described to promote tumorigenesis and the escape of immune surveillance in melanoma and pancreatic ductal carcinoma [58,59]. Moreover, targeting this SDF-1 resulting from FAP+ CAF has been proved to synergize with immunotherapy [60]. Unravelling if this effect occurs in RCC would have a direct impact in the era of immunotherapy resurgence.\nCAF are main responsible of ECM remodeling in TME by the production and secretion of proteases [61,62] Fibroblast activation protein has a unique dual enzymatic activity (both collagenase and serine-peptidase), that enables the reorganization of collagen and fibronectin fibers to promote tumor cell invasion in pancreatic cells [63]. Strong relationship of FAP with RCC aggressiveness suggests a similar role for CAF and FAP in this tumor [54].\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives. Targeting CAF, a new front against tumor microenvironment\nIn the era of personalized medicine and targeted therapies the comprehension of the tumor as a society composed by different elements extends the scope of action of anti-cancer drugs. This aspect acquires special relevance in RCC due to its radio- and chemo-resistant identity. In fact, tyrosine-kinase receptor inhibitors-based antiangiogenic treatment and PD-1\/PD-L1 targeting immunotherapy are the main treatments that significantly improve patients\u2019 survival. An effective targeting of CAF, one of the most important cell population in tumor microenvironment, seems the ideal complement considering their protumor role.\nThe fact that FAP is exclusively expressed in CAF, makes this protein an attractive target to develop CAF-mediated anti-tumor drugs. Different strategies have been designed such as inhibitors of its enzymatic activity [64,65], prodrugs activated by its activity [66], FAP targeting antibodies [67], vaccines and even CAR-T cell technology [68]. Some of them are still being tested in clinical trials.\nAlthough these strategies seem promising, targeting CAF in an effective manner appears much more complex than inhibiting the function of a specific protein. Unraveling if CAF conform subgroups specialized in different actions marks a milestone in the comprehension of the role of CAF in cancer in general and in RCC in particular. Similarly, understanding the impact of FAP expression by a subset of CAF will measure the usefulness of FAP targeting strategies. Removing the protumor cohort of CAF and potentiating the effect of those with antitumor activity is still utopic. However, reeducating those foes to friends as recently was proposed by Chen et al. would undoubtedly suppose a step forward in the war against cancer [69].\n\n\nGrants\nThis work was partially funded by the ELKARTEK 18\/10 grant from the Basque Government.

Soil contamination by PHCs result in significant human health, plant life, animal and environmental defects with rising public concerns [1\u20134]. Furthermore, environmental pollution is considered to be a major impediment to sustainable development and has become an increasingly important topic for decision makers in economical, industrial and political considerations [5,6].\nDrill cuttings produced in the petroleum industry are a major waste management problem due to the types of contaminants and volumes generated. Drill cuttings are produced during petroleum exploration, extraction and production. The excavated materials when mixed with oil-based drilling fluids pose to be potentially long-term contaminants, particularly when they are not properly managed [7\u201310]. PHC contaminated soils accumulate in the environment due to leaks from storage tanks, aged pipelines and waste disposal sites [3,11] during the exploration, extraction, transportation, and storage of crude oil and its various derivatives. Environmental damage also arises due to the intentional discharge of oil and oily wastes into the environment [5]. With the modern economy\u2019s continued dependence on petroleum alongside increasing world demand for fuel, contamination from these sources pose to be a continuing environmental risk [12\u201314], also potentially leading to increased economic losses [5]. The widespread use of PHCs has invariably led them to be a persistent and long-standing source of soil pollution [15]. Therefore, soil contamination by PHCs is of increasing social, sanitary, environmental and economic concern [16].\nSoil washing is a mechanical technique or physical process which removes contaminants from soils using liquids [5,17,18]. This technique is normally performed with water and may or may not involve the use of additives such as biosurfactants [1,19]. Soil washing utilizing biosurfactants is not characterized by the metabolic activities of biosurfactants or the effect of biosurfactants on the properties of the microbial cell-surface. Rather, it depends on the chemical-physical properties of the biosurfactants [20]. Soil washing techniques are site-specific as they depend on the soil characteristics (e.g. organic and inorganic material content and particle size distribution) [21], and the type of hydrocarbon contaminant(s) present. Due to this specificity, research is important to provide potentially useful universal guidelines in the selection of biosurfactants [22]. Soil washing is described by Urum et al. [13] as a potentially innovative remediation or treatment approach because its full-scale application in the treatment of crude oil contaminated soil is limited. It has the added advantage of being less time-consuming than other remediation techniques such as bioremediation and phytoremediation. The approach is also cost-effective [13]. The application of biosurfactants has also been reported to enhance contaminant flushing by reducing the hydrophobic hydrocarbon content in the contaminated soils [23]. Furthermore, soil washing also allows recovery of large volumes of contaminants [13].\nBiosurfactant application in soil washing is investigated based on the identified advantages and physiochemical characteristics of biosurfactants which make them better matched to environmental applications [21]. When compared to synthetic (chemically synthesized) surfactants, biosurfactants display excellent surface activity, higher selectivity, higher biodegradability and less adverse environmental impact. The excellent surface activity makes biosurfactants excellent dispersing agents and emulsifiers [20,24\u201326]. In addition, they display high activity at extreme conditions of salinity, temperature, and pH. Biosurfactants are environmentally compatible, have lower toxicity and can be released into the environment without resulting in further damage from residues. Thus, removal of biosurfactants from effluents before disposal is not required. Furthermore, biosurfactants can be synthesized from renewable feedstocks such as industrial wastes and by-products [20,21,23,24]. The ability of biosurfactants to be produced from waste substrates also lowers the cost of production and reduces the polluting effects of biosurfactant production processes [2,20]. Major disadvantages of synthetic surfactants are their resistance to biodegradation and their toxicity [4]. The rhamnolipid biosurfactant selected for this work is one of the best-known and well-described glycolipid compounds. Glycolipids are the most-studied and best known microbial surfactants [24\u201328] and have attracted significant commercial interest [29]. Rhamnolipid has been commercialized by some companies such as Jeneil Biotech Inc., AGAE Technologies USA and Rhamnolipids Companies Inc. [29], thus making it a viable option with potential for being applied on an industrial scale.\nInnovative remediation processes are a necessity, and the ultimate goal of a sustainable future is the ability to re-use treated waste streams [2]. The burden of disposal of drill cuttings and petroleum-contaminated soil is reduced when the waste streams are treated to levels that permit re-use [2,30]. The present work was aimed at investigating the effectiveness of soil washing utilizing rhamnolipid biosurfactants in the reduction of PHCs present in drill cuttings and petroleum-contaminated soils obtained from northeastern British Columbia (BC) in Canada. The residual concentrations were also compared to Canadian regulatory standards, to provide insight into acceptable disposal strategies and\/or possibilities of re-use.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nProperty of contaminated samples\n\nDrill cuttings\nDrill cuttings (DC) were obtained from Tervita Silverberry Landfill, Fort St. John, BC. The initial total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration of the sample was 5939\u202fmg\/kg. The concentrations of the petroleum hydrocarbon fractions \u2013 F2, F3 and F4 fractions were also analyzed. Initial concentrations of F2 fraction (representing C10\u2013C16), F3 fraction (representing C16\u2013C34) and F4 fraction (representing C34\u2013C50) were 2334\u202fmg\/kg, 3350\u202fmg\/kg and 255\u202fmg\/kg respectively.\nPHC sub-fractions are defined by the US Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons Criteria Working Group. There are four fractions defined in equivalent carbon (C) numbers. These are Fraction 1 (F1: C6\u2013C10), Fraction 2 (F2: C10\u2013C16), Fraction 3 (F3: C16\u2013C34), and Fraction 4 (F4: C34\u2013C50) [31].\n\n\nPetroleum-contaminated soil\nPetroleum-contaminated soils (PCS) were obtained from Back-to-Earth Remediation facility, located 42.5\u202fkm north of Prince George, BC. The soil was classified as exceeding the BC Contaminated Sites Regulation (CSR) Commercial and or Industrial land-use standards. The initial total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration was 3276\u202fmg\/kg. Initial concentrations of F2 fraction (C10\u2013C16), F3 fraction (C16\u2013C34) and F4 fraction (C34\u2013C50) were 577\u202fmg\/kg, 2365\u202fmg\/kg and 334\u202fmg\/kg respectively.\nBoth samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4\u202f\u00b0C to minimize degradation, reduce the abiotic loss of hydrocarbons, and maintain moisture [32,33]. Samples were oven-dried at 50\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u202fd and sieved using 850\u202f\u00b5m # 20 ASTM E-11 specification sieve (Cole-Parmer Canada Company, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) to remove stones and coarse particles prior to hydrocarbon analysis and treatment.\n\n\n\nChemicals\nAll chemicals used were HPLC grade with a minimum of 97% purity.\n\n\nBiosurfactant\nCommercial rhamnolipid biosurfactant (R90\u2013100, 90% purity)) produced by AGAE Technologies LLC (Corvallis, Oregon, USA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) value for the rhamnolipid used was computed as 100\u202fmg\/L at 23\u202f\u00b0C. The rhamnolipid decreased the surface tension of water to 30\u202fmN\/m.\n\n\nDetermination of critical micelle concentration\nSerial dilutions of the rhamnolipid solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 10\u202fmg\/L to 800\u202fmg\/L. The upper limit was capped at 800\u202fmg\/L after constant surface tension values were observed [34]. Each test was conducted in quadruplicate, and the average calculated. The surface tension was measured using a Surface Tensiomat (model 21, Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at room temperature (approximately 23\u202f\u00b0C). For accuracy, the values were measured in triplicate. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of surfactants in aqueous solutions is dependent on temperature, water hardness and electrolyte [21]. The CMC of rhamnolipid was determined by plotting the graph of the surface tension versus the log of the rhamnolipid concentration [34,35]. The CMC was observed as the point beyond which further increase in biosurfactant concentration did not result in a decrease in the surface tension of water [34].\n\n\nBiosurfactant enhanced soil washing\nIn the present study, the Taguchi experimental method was used for experimental design that allowed all five factors to be tested at various levels at the same time (Table 1\n). Each experimental level was carried out in triplicate. The biosurfactant concentrations tested were at and above the CMC of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant used. Five parameters that influence hydrocarbon removal with biosurfactants were investigated at five levels each. The parameters were: temperature, rhamnolipid concentration, washing time, stirring speed, and solution-to-sample ratio (S\/S ratio). S\/S ratio represents the volume of the rhamnolipid solution to the mass of sample, reported as mL\/g.\nDC and PCS were dried at 50\u202f\u00b0C for about 24\u202fh and sieved with 20\u202f\u00b5m ASTM E-11 specification sieve (Cole-Parmer Canada Company, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) to remove stones and coarse sand particles. Subsequently, 5\u202fg of samples were weighed into 125\u202fmL Erlenmeyer flasks and covered with aluminum thin foils. The samples in the Erlenmeyer flasks were placed in environmental growth chambers few hours before treatment to pre-condition the samples to the treatment temperature. The growth chambers had been pre-set to the appropriate temperature 48\u202fh before the washing began.\nThe appropriate volume based on the test solution-to-sample ratio (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) and concentration of biosurfactant solution (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500\u202fmg\/L) were added to the samples in the Erlenmeyer flasks. Equal-sized magnetic stirring bars (VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were placed in the flasks and experiments conducted at the temperature levels tested (10, 20, 30, 40\u202f\u00b0C and room temperature). For samples washed at 30\u202f\u00b0C and 40\u202f\u00b0C, the flasks were placed on a hot plate magnetic stirrer (VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). After washing the samples at the specified washing time (10, 30, 60, 180 and 360\u202fmin) and stirring speed (100, 150, 200, 250 and 300\u202frpm), the soil particles in the flasks were allowed to settle for 3\u202fh after which the biosurfactant solution was pipetted off. Pipettes were used to transfer the supernatant rather than decanting to reduce the loss of samples. The samples were then rinsed using distilled water under the same treatment conditions used for the biosurfactant treatment with the exception of washing time. Rinsing was conducted for a duration of 10\u202fmin for all samples. Rinsing ensures oil is removed from the wall of the flasks, biosurfactant is removed from the samples, and emulsions are not formed in the process of extracting residual hydrocarbons from the samples using solvents [8,36]. After rinsing, the soil particles were allowed to settle for 3\u202fh after which the rinse solution was pipetted off and the samples air-dried. Room temperature for the washing treatment averaged 23.5\u202f\u00b0C. The washed samples were stored at 4\u202f\u00b0C until hydrocarbon extraction.\n\n\nPetroleum hydrocarbon extraction and analysis\nSamples were oven dried at 50\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u20133 d and sieved using 850\u202f\u00b5m # 20 ASTM E-11 specification sieve (Cole-Parmer Canada Company, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) prior to hydrocarbon analysis and treatment. Hydrocarbon was extracted using a mechanical extraction method. The method used was adapted from the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment (CCME) reference method for the Canada-wide standard for PHCs in soil [37]. To extract hydrocarbon from the contaminated samples, 2\u202fg of prepared samples were weighed into 20\u202fmL clear glass vials (VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) with 10\u202fmL of 1:1 n-hexane\/acetone added. The vials were arranged on a platform shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, New Jersey, USA) for mechanical extraction for 1\u202fh at 250\u202frpm. The vials were allowed to settle for 90\u202fmin before transferring the supernatant into a 40\u202fmL-vial using transfer pipettes. The extraction was repeated three more times, with the last cycle run for 140\u202fmin, to achieve a minimum solvent\/dry soil ratio of 20:1 as specified by the method.\nThe extracted solution was cleaned up using a silica gel column to remove naturally occurring polar organics [37]. The tip of the glass column (30\u202fcm length, 16\u202fmm diameter) was plugged with glass wool (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and packed with activated silica gel (VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) followed by anhydrous sodium sulfate (VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) to a depth of 6.5\u202fcm and 2.5\u202fcm respectively. Silica gel was activated at 101\u202f\u00b0C for 12\u202fh and sodium sulfate dried at 400\u202f\u00b0C for 4\u202fh. Activated silica gel and dried sodium sulfate were placed in desiccators to cool before use. The packed column was pre-eluted with 20\u202fmL of 1:1 dichloromethane\/n-hexane (VWR International Co. BDH Chemicals, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) to wet and condition the column, and the eluate discarded. The extracted solution was transferred into the column, followed by 20\u202fmL of 1:1 dichloromethane\/n-hexane to carry the sample through the column, with some of the solvent mixture used to rinse the vials into the column. The column was further flushed with 20\u202fmL of 1:1 dichloromethane\/n-hexane. The eluate was collected in 100\u202fmL round bottom flasks.\nSolvents were evaporated using a Heidolph Laborota 4000 rotary evaporator (Schwabach, Germany) at 35\u202f\u00b0C and speed of 30\u202frpm and the extract transferred into 2\u202fmL GC vials in dichloromethane for chromatographic analysis. The GC vials were clear vials (76-series, VWR International Co., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) with caps (PTFE\/Silicone\/PTFE septa). This septum type was specifically used because it is resistant to dichloromethane and it minimizes volatilization losses.\n\n\nGC-FID analysis\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis was performed using an Agilent\/HP 6890 Series Gas Chromatography (GC) equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) (Santa Clara, California, USA). The equipment was provided by Northern Analytical Laboratory Service (NALS), UNBC, Prince George, Canada. For the analysis of F2 and F3 fractions, a fused silica capillary column \u2013 Supelco 2-4080 SupelcoWax 10 capillary (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA) with a length of 30\u202fm, inside diameter of 0.32\u202fmm and film thickness of 0.25\u202f\u00b5m was used. The parameters used for analysis were; injection volume at 2.0\u202f\u00b5L, injector temperature at 270\u202f\u00b0C, detector temperature at 300\u202f\u00b0C, split ratio at 10:1, helium gas used as carrier gas was maintained at 21.28 psi pressure and constant flow rate of 5.2\u202fmL\/min. Oven temperature started at 70\u202f\u00b0C and was held for 2\u202fmin, ramped at 5\u202f\u00b0C\/min to 150\u202f\u00b0C, and further increased at 10\u202f\u00b0C\/min to 270\u202f\u00b0C and held for 25\u202fmin. Total run time for a sample analysis was 55\u202fmin.\nFor the F4 Fraction analysis, a Zebron ZB-1HT Inferno capillary column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, California, USA) with a length of 30\u202fm, inside diameter of 0.32\u202fmm and film thickness of 0.25\u202f\u00b5m was used. The parameters used for analysis were injection volume at 1.0\u202f\u00b5L, injector temperature at 320\u202f\u00b0C, detector temperature at 300\u202f\u00b0C, split ratio at 10:1, helium gas used as carrier gas was maintained at 9.52 psi pressure and constant flow rate of 1.4\u202fmL\/min. Oven temperature started at 130\u202f\u00b0C and was held for 2\u202fmin, ramped at 30\u202f\u00b0C\/min to 270\u202f\u00b0C, and further increased at 5\u202f\u00b0C\/min to 385\u202f\u00b0C and held for 1\u202fmin. Total run time for a sample analysis was 30.67\u202fmin.\nDecane (nC10), hexadecane (nC16), and tetratriacontane (nC34) (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co., Oakville, Ontario, Canada) in dichloromethane at approximate concentrations of 20, 50, 100, 200 and 400\u202fmg\/L were used to run a 5-point calibration curve for retention time marking and for calculating average response factor. The concentration of each fraction for each sample extract was calculated by using the integration of all area counts within each fraction, the final volume of sample extract, dry weight of sample taken and the computed average response factor [37]. Pentacontane (nC50) (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) was used for retention time marking for the F4 fraction analysis. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (nC10 to nC50) for this work is calculated as the sum of F2, F3 and F4 fractions.\nThe percentage of hydrocarbon removal was calculated using Eq.

It allows combination of multiple factors at multiple levels. The Taguchi method uses orthogonal arrays to study entire processes with minimal number of experiments [38]. The Taguchi method was used in designing the experimental plan as it saves time and reduces the number of experiments and experimentation cost [39,40]. The signal-to-noise ratios and analysis of variance were used to investigate the effect of the washing parameters on petroleum hydrocarbon reduction (PHC).\n\n\nStatistics\nAll triplicates of each experimental level were analyzed for residual PHC concentrations. The mean values and standard deviation were calculated for all experiment levels. Data were analyzed using the Minitab 17 software. The Error bars (when shown) represents standard deviation.\nThe optimal washing parameters and the optimal parameter combinations were obtained by analysis of the signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio. By using the S\/N ratio, Taguchi experimental design identifies noises (i.e., outside influences) that affects the experimental design [39]. The desired level of signal is compared to the background noise; the higher the S\/N, the less prominent the noise is [40]. The \u201clarger the better\u201d situation is applied as the quality characteristic in the analysis of S\/N ratio in this study because the larger the PHC reduction, the better the result. The highest S\/N ratio gives the optimal level of the parameter tested [38,39].\nThe main effect plot is a plot or graphical representation that identifies the optimal level of each parameter based on the S\/N ratio [39].\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical significance and the level of importance of the parameters on PHC reduction. ANOVA was tested for P\u202f<\u202f0.05 for significance.\n\n\n\nResults and discussions\n\nDrill cuttings\n\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and hydrocarbon fractions reduction in drill cuttings\nThe highest reduction for TPH, F2 and F3 fractions was recorded at experiment L22. The highest reduction for F4 fraction was recorded at experiment L24 (Fig. 1\n).\nThe maximum PHC reduction rate for TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions was 76.8%, 85.4%, 71.3% and 76.9% respectively. Overall, the highest PHC reduction was observed in the F4 fraction, as reduction rates for all experiments were above 62%. Average reduction rate across all experimental levels for F4 fraction was 68.3%. Lowest PHC reduction rate for TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions was 27.8%, 50.3%, 6.9% and 61.9% respectively. For TPH, F3 and F4, the lowest reduction was recorded at L18 while L19 resulted in the lowest reduction of F2.\n\n\nResidual PHC concentrations in drill cuttings\nThe highest residual TPH concentration in DC was 4348\u202fmg\/kg after rhamnolipid washing, largely due to the F3 fraction which was found to have the highest residual concentration at 3120\u202fmg\/kg. A common trend noticeable in the experiments conducted at room temperature were the high PHC reduction rates. Average reduction rates at room temperature for TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions were 76.0%, 84.7%, 70.2% and 73.6% respectively in drill cuttings. This trend was verified by ANOVA. Temperature was indicated as having a significant effect on rhamnolipid washing at a \u03b1-level (i.e., significance level) of 0.05 for TPH, F2 and F3 fraction. The P-values for temperature for TPH, F2 and F3 fraction were less than 0.05. While the P-value for effect of temperature in F4 fraction reduction was higher than 0.05, the P-value for this factor was lower than all other four factors. For TPH reduction, the degree of significance of the factors in decreasing order, based on P-values were temperature, solution-to-sample ratio, washing time, stirring speed, and rhamnolipid concentration.\nYan et al. [8] observed an 85.2% reduction of TPH in drill cuttings from 85,000\u202fmg\/kg to 12,600\u202fmg\/kg. Rhamnolipid soil washing of drill cuttings in the present study yielded a maximum TPH removal of 76.8%. The results are comparable because according to Iturbe et al. [41], the rate of removal of PHC in soils is affected by the initial TPH concentration. The higher the initial TPH, the higher the removal rates and the removal efficiency of surfactants. Results reported by Lai et al. [4] for severely contaminated samples also showed higher removal efficiency than slightly contaminated soils despite the fact that similar treatment conditions were used. Thus, biosurfactant-enhanced washing has a high potential as an environmentally friendly option of removing bulk contaminants from soils [42].\n\n\nComparison of residual PHC concentrations with Canada-wide standards\nThe residual PHC concentrations were compared to the CCME 2008 Canada-Wide Standards (CWS) for PHCs in soils (PHC CWS) [43] presented in Table 2\n. The figures presented are at the Tier 1 generic numerical level, which are remedial standards for both surface and subsoils which occur in four different categories of land-use as at 2017. In the present study, the most stringent standards for F2, F3, and F4 fractions that consider protection of potable groundwater were adopted for comparison.\nAs shown by these results, this experiment indicates that rhamnolipid washing is an effective and time-efficient process for reducing the PHC content of drill cuttings. The ranges of residual concentrations in the samples were F2\u202f=\u202f342\u20131159\u202fmg\/kg, F3\u202f=\u202f960\u20133120\u202fmg\/kg and F4\u202f=\u202f59\u201397\u202fmg\/kg. The CGS standards were used for comparison since over 71% of the drill cuttings in this study had grain sizes greater than 250\u202f\u00b5m. Canada-wide standards for petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC CWS) follows the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) soil classification which classifies soil with a median grain size of >75\u202f\u00b5m as coarse-grained soil [43].\nWhen compared to standards in Table 2, residual concentrations for F2 and F3 fractions exceeded the standards for all four land-use categories, while F4 fractions were below the regulatory standards for all land-use categories. This again indicates the need for further remediation methods to reduce the PHC of F2 and F3 fractions to levels below the CWS when CCME standards are applied.\n\n\nOptimal rhamnolipid washing conditions in drill cuttings\nThe optimal rhamnolipid washing conditions for TPH reduction were: temperature of 23.5\u202f\u00b0C (room temperature), rhamnolipid concentration of 500\u202fmg\/L, washing time of 30\u202fmin, stirring speed of 100\u202frpm and S\/S ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 2\n).\nUsing S\/N ratios in TPH reduction, the factors are ranked from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest) as temperature, washing time, S\/S ratio, rhamnolipid concentration, and stirring speed. Based on ANOVA results, temperature showed a significant effect on rhamnolipid washing. Using the P-values, the degree of significance of all factors on TPH reduction in decreasing order were temperature, S\/S ratio, washing time, stirring speed and rhamnolipid concentration. Optimal washing conditions for F2, F3 and F4 fractions are presented in Figs. 3\u20135\n\n\n.\nYan et al. [8] conducted rhamnolipid biosurfactant washing of drill cuttings. The authors found the optimal washing conditions to be a temperature of 60\u202f\u00b0C, rhamnolipid concentration of 360\u202fmg\/L, washing time of 20\u202fmin, stirring speed of 200\u202frpm and liquid\/solid ratio of 3:1. Optimal results from the present study are comparable and show a good fit to applications as lower stirring speed and S\/S ratio will ultimately reduce application costs. Although the optimal rhamnolipid concentration in the present study was 500\u202fmg\/L, the highest TPH reduction was recorded at a concentration of 200\u202fmg\/L.\nThe hydrocarbon fractions, F2, F3 and F4 recorded different extents of removal. Even though the experimental conditions that resulted in the maximum reduction for TPH, F2 and F3 fractions were similar in each sample type, the optimal conditions based on the main effect plot varied. This observation is important because the regulatory standards used as the comparison in the present study (i.e., PHC CWS) expressed regulatory standards of hydrocarbon levels as F2, F3 and F4 fractions, not as TPH.\nBased on ANOVA results at a significance level of 0.05, only temperature showed a significant effect on rhamnolipid washing for the reduction of TPH, F2 and F3 fractions; no individual factor showed a significant effect on rhamnolipid washing for the F4 fraction. Temperature, however, had the lowest P-value for the F4 fraction.\n\n\nInteractions between test parameters\nInteraction plots were used to investigate the interaction between temperature and the other four washing parameters- rhamnolipid concentration, washing time, stirring speed and S\/S ratio on TPH reduction during rhamnolipid washing of drill cuttings. The interaction plots were similar, with all parameters responding distinctly to the room temperature. At room temperature, all the test parameters at all levels display high S\/N ratio. At all parameter levels, the lines showed a distinct pattern which indicates that response of the parameters changes as temperature changes. This is an indication that the factors interact.\n\n\n\nPetroleum-contaminated soil\n\nTotal petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and hydrocarbon fractions reduction in PCS\nThe highest reduction for TPH, F2 and F3 fractions in petroleum-contaminated soil was recorded at experiment L2. The highest reduction for F4 fraction was recorded at experiment L25. The maximum PHC reduction rate for TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions was 58.5%, 48.4%, 63.5% and 59.8% respectively. Overall, the highest PHC reduction was observed in the F3 fraction, as reduction rates for all experiments were above 49%, and average reduction rate across all experimental levels was 56.4% (Fig. 6\n). Lowest PHC reduction rate for TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions was 41.4%, 15.3%, 49.2% and 26.8% respectively. For TPH, F2 and F3 the lowest reduction was recorded at L7, while L17 resulted in the lowest reduction of F4.\nThe TPH removal rates recorded in the present work is comparable to results presented by Lai et al. [4]. Maximum TPH removal with rhamnolipid washing for TPH contaminated soil with an initial concentration of 3000\u202fmg\/kg was given as 23.4% at a concentration of 0.2 mass%. Iturbe et al. [41] reported comparable results with on-site soil washing of PHC contaminated soil with initial average TPH of 9172\u202fmg\/kg. About 83% TPH removal was observed with soil washing. Biosurfactant soil washing in the research was carried out in multiple steps until the final TPH concentration required was achieved. Whereas, the rhamnolipid soil washing process used in the present study was conducted only once and it gave reduction values as high as 58.5% for PCS.\n\n\nResidual PHC concentrations in petroleum-contaminated soil\nIt was observed that after rhamnolipid washing, residual TPH concentration in the sample was below 1920\u202fmg\/kg, largely due to F3 fraction, as the highest residual concentration for this fraction was recorded as 1203\u202fmg\/kg (L7). Based on the results, this experiment indicates that rhamnolipid washing is an effective and time-efficient procedure for reducing the PHC content of petroleum-contaminated media.\n\n\nComparison of residual PHC concentrations with Canada-wide standards\nThe ranges of residual concentrations in the PCS were found to be: F2\u202f=\u202f298\u2013486\u202fmg\/kg, F3\u202f=\u202f864\u20131203\u202fmg\/kg and F4\u202f=\u202f134\u2013244\u202fmg\/kg. When compared to Table 2, residual concentrations for F2 fractions exceeded the standards for all four land-use categories, while F3 fractions exceeded the standards for agricultural and residential\/parkland land-use but were below the standards for commercial and industrial land-use. F4 fractions, on the other hand, were all below the regulatory standards. These residual concentrations indicate the need for further remediation methods to reduce the PHC of F2 and F3 fractions to levels below the CWS.\n\n\nOptimal rhamnolipid washing conditions in petroleum contaminated soil\nUsing S\/N ratios in TPH reduction, the parameters are ranked from 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest) as temperature, S\/S ratio, washing time, rhamnolipid concentration, and stirring speed. The optimal rhamnolipid washing conditions for TPH reduction in PCS as shown in Fig. 7\n were: temperature of 23.5\u202f\u00b0C (room temperature), rhamnolipid concentration of 500\u202fmg\/L, washing time of 30\u202fmin, stirring speed of 200\u202frpm and S\/S ratio of 4:1.\nBased on ANOVA results, at a significance level of 0.05, no individual factor showed a significant effect on rhamnolipid washing. Temperature, however, had the lowest P-value for TPH, F2 and F3. For F4 fraction, rhamnolipid concentration had the lowest P-value.\nFor overall TPH reduction, the degree of significance, based on P-values in decreasing order, were temperature, washing time, solution-to-sample ratio, rhamnolipid concentration and stirring speed. Optimal washing conditions for F2, F3 and F4 fractions are presented in Figs. 8\u201310\n\n\n.\nThe pattern of change of S\/N ratio for F2 reduction was similar to TPH for parameters- temperature, rhamnolipid concentration and washing time, with some minor differences. The pattern of change of S\/N ratio for F3 reduction was similar to TPH for all parameters with some minor differences, despite the difference in the optimum conditions that gave the best reduction in TPH and F3 fraction.\nVariability among the replicates as depicted by the error bars in Figs. 1 and 6 for both drill cuttings and petroleum contaminated soil was high. The experimental variability could have been due to changes in the laboratory conditions during biosurfactant washing or sampling variability.\n\n\nEffect of individual test parameters on PCS\n\nEffect of temperature\nThe optimal temperature condition for TPH, F2 and F4 fraction removal in PCS was room temperature (approximately 23.5\u202f\u00b0C) and 10\u202f\u00b0C for F3 fraction. The signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratios for 10\u202f\u00b0C and room temperature in F3 fraction reduction were observed to be close: 35.32 and 35.18 respectively. It was observed that increase in temperature from 10\u202f\u00b0C to 20\u202f\u00b0C led to a decrease in TPH, F2, F3, F4 fractions. Further increase in temperature to room temperature showed an evident increase in hydrocarbon reduction. For TPH, F2 and F3 fractions, a further increase in temperature from room temperature to 40\u202f\u00b0C decreased the rate of hydrocarbon reduction. For F2 fraction, on the other hand, increase from room temperature to 30\u202f\u00b0C reduced the PHC reduction rate while a subsequent increase in temperature to 40\u202f\u00b0C led to increased hydrocarbon removal. Temperature is an important factor because the process of desorption and dissolution which affects PHC removal are dependent on temperature [8].\nAccording to Paria [15], in the presence of surfactants, solubilization of organic compounds is significantly affected by temperature. The author further states that for non-ionic and ionic surfactants, the degree of solubilization increases with temperature up to an optimum temperature where maximum solubilization is observed. However, the hydrophilic chain length affects the optimum temperature. The results observed from the present study reflect different optimum temperatures depending on the hydrocarbon fraction.\n\n\nEffect of rhamnolipid concentration\nOptimal rhamnolipid concentration for PHC reduction of TPH, F3 and F4 fractions was 500\u202fmg\/L, and 400\u202fmg\/L for F2 fraction. Similarly, the observed removal rate showed a different trend with F2 fraction than with TPH, F3 and F4 fractions. With F2 fraction, increase in rhamnolipid concentration from 100\u202fmg\/L to 400\u202fmg\/L increased the removal of hydrocarbon, further increase to 500\u202fmg\/L resulted in a decrease in hydrocarbon reduction. TPH, F3 and F4 fraction all responded identically to increase in rhamnolipid concentration. The rate of hydrocarbon reduction reduced initially with an increase in rhamnolipid concentration to a point. After that point, further increase of rhamnolipid concentration resulted in increased PHC removal. This is similar to results obtained by Chapr\u00e3o et al. [44] and Lai et al. [4]. The authors observed that with an increase in rhamnolipid concentration, the solubility of crude oil increased. The efficiency of removal of PHC from soils and the concentration of rhamnolipid were observed to be positively correlated.\nThe effect of biosurfactant concentration is important because biosurfactant acts differently relative to their concentration. Some biosurfactants are more effective at concentrations below the CMC while some are more effective at concentrations above the CMC. While removal efficiency of rhamnolipids and surfactin were shown by Lai et al. [4] to increase with increase in concentrations above the CMC, at concentrations above CMC, lecithin and tannin could not increase crude oil solubilization [44]. CMC is the biosurfactant concentration at which micelles start to form solubilization [44]. The concentrations of rhamnolipid used for this experiment were at and above the CMC value. The overall results are similar to what is reported in literature, rhamnolipid was more effective at concentrations above CMC.\n\n\nEffect of washing time\nOptimal rhamnolipid washing time for reduction of TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fraction were 30\u202fmin, 180\u202fmin, 30\u202fmin and 10\u202fmin respectively. Washing time for TPH and F3 fraction were the same, an observation that aligns with F3 fraction having the highest impact on TPH reduction. Washing time is an important test parameter as sufficient treatment time is required for effective removal of PHCs [44]. Chapr\u00e3o et al. [44] tested contact times of 5, 10, 20 and 1440\u202fmin. In general, increase from 5 to 1440\u202fmin resulted in a decrease in oil removal performance through biosurfactant washing. This is similar to results presented in this study. The overall trend showed a reduced PHC reduction rate at higher treatment times. 5 \u2013 10\u202fmin under agitation was considered sufficient for PHC reduction by Chapr\u00e3o et al. [44]. The authors infer an interaction between agitation\/stirring speed and contact time. P-values (probability values) for washing time and stirring speed presented by ANOVA results were not close. However, an interaction plot of washing time and stirring speed showed non-parallel lines which reflected a level of interaction between the factors. Lai et al. [4] also found that PHC removal efficiency did not vary sufficiently with changes in treatment time from 1 d to 7 d. Rather, similar removal efficiency was recorded for both 1 d and 7 d, and in some cases, a decrease in TPH removal was reported at 7 d. It can be inferred from the results that rhamnolipid washing is time efficient; a factor that contributes positively in the potentials of combining this technique with other time-consuming remediation methods.\n\n\nEffect of stirring speed\nOptimal stirring speed for removal of TPH, F2, F3 and F4 fraction were 200, 300, 150 and 200\u202frpm respectively. The highest stirring speed is recorded for F2 fraction. A review of the S\/N ratios, however, shows that S\/N ratios for 100, 200 and 300\u202frpm are quite close. These were 30.68, 30.63 and 30.85, which indicates that increasing stirring speed from 100 to 300 does not effectively contribute to an increase in F2 fraction reduction. The results indicate that lower values of stirring speed tested (levels 1\u20133) are sufficient for PHC reduction. Lai et al. [4] reported shaking speed of 100 and 200\u202frpm as increasing the TPH removal efficiency in the washing experiment conducted. At 0 and 5\u202frpm shaking speed, TPH removal efficacy recorded by the authors was about 5%. Lai et al. [4] noted the need for caution when testing the effect of agitation. Although the authors tested for shaking speed (while this experiment tested stirring speed), it was advised that the level of agitation applied should not be too high. This is to ensure that the level of agitation employed is just enough to ensure efficient contact between PHC and the biosurfactants. Vigorous agitation, on the other hand, could result in PHC removal mainly due to mechanical detachment. Thus, overstating the removal efficiency of the biosurfactants added. Chapr\u00e3o et al. [44] tested four biosurfactant types and recorded varying results on the effect of agitation on PHC removal during biosurfactant washing. Only three of the four biosurfactants tested showed better removal rates with agitation. Results from the authors indicate that effect of agitation depends on the type of soil, the type of surfactant and the concentration of the biosurfactant.\n\n\nEffect of solution-to-sample ratio\nTPH, F2, F3 and F4 fractions all showed different optimal conditions for S\/S ratio. The optimal conditions were 4:1, 1:1, 3:1, 2:1 for TPH, F2, F3, and F4 fractions respectively. Yan et al. [8] and Urum et al. [36] reported a ratio of 3:1 as the optimal value for S\/S ratio. According to Yan et al. [8], a ratio of 3:1 is an acceptable value when considering the economic and operational aspects of biosurfactant washing.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, rhamnolipid-enhanced soil washing of two different soil types was evaluated. Taguchi experimental design was employed to study the effect of temperature, rhamnolipid concentration, washing time, stirring speed and solution-to-sample ratio as potentially vital parameters for rhamnolipid-enhanced soil washing.\nWashing of drill cuttings and petroleum-contaminated soil has been demonstrated as an effective treatment method to reduce PHC concentrations in petroleum-contaminated soils and drill cuttings. A potential benefit of soil washing is reduced process time; however, the need for additional treatment processes is recognized to ensure that the residual levels of contaminants in impacted media can be reduced to levels within provincial and\/or federal regulatory standards. This makes biosurfactant washing an efficient first step that can be applied singly to reduce PHC concentrations in contaminated soil\/media; or in addition to a time-consuming secondary remedial process such as biodegradation.\n\n","1400":"\n\nIntroduction\nBone tissue infection is the most common complication in orthopedic surgery [1,2], which can damage the self-healing ability of bone tissue, leading to severe bone loss, implant failure and even amputation [3]. In addition, when the self-healing ability of bone tissue is destroyed in the infected region, an artificial matrix that repairs bone could achieve the purpose of bone regeneration. Therefore, the development of biomaterials with dual functions of bone regeneration and infection inhibition has important practical significance for the treatment of bone infection. Polylactic acid (PLLA) is a bioresorbable material with good biocompatibility. It is a clinically recognized biomedical material [4] and plays an important role in guiding bone regeneration [5]. However, PLLA lacks bioactivity, antibacterial ability, and osteoinductivity, which restricts its application in clinical bone repair [6,7]. Nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) is a kind of biomaterial that can induce apatite deposition on surface, adhesion and proliferation of cells, and differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The doping of n-HA can effectively improve the bioactivity and osteoinductivity of PLLA, extending its applications in biomedical field [8,9]. Zhang H et al. prepared PLLA\/HA composite as a matrix for bone regeneration, and the results showed that the composite promoted osteogenesis and improved bone regenerative ability [10]. Nevertheless, bone infection problems are often overlooked, leading to implant failure. Bone infections are mainly caused by bacteria [11], and currently, the most common methods of treating bone infections are debridement and systemic antibiotic therapy [12]. Studies have shown that PLLA composite microspheres [13], membranes [14], and porous scaffolds [15], etc., can be used as antibiotic carriers to continuously release antibiotics to treat bone infections. However, long-term and excessive antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of bacterial resistance [16], besides burst problems after antibiotic implantation [17,18]. Therefore, improving the anti-infection ability and reducing the bacterial resistance of PLLA\/HA composite fiber has become an urgent need.\nFrom the material science point of view, the nanostructured antibacterial coating on the implant has unique properties such as high specific surface area and surface energy that can mimic the microstructures of natural tissue while possess antibacterial property at the same time [19]. Nano-silver (n-Ag) has a broad spectrum of antibacterial property [20] and minimal bacterial resistance [21], therefore, the introduction of positive n-Ag coating on the surface of PLLA\/n-HA composite is an effective way of inhibiting bone infection at early stages. Currently, the methods for constructing n-Ag coating are mainly magnetron sputtering [22] and wet chemical deposition [23]. Magnetron sputtering is a linear technique that cannot be applied to medical materials with complex structures, besides, silver ions (Ag+) are directly coated on the surface of the material by this method that can cause burst release of Ag+ at early stages, unable to achieve a long-lasting antibacterial effect. The study of Mishra SK et al. [24] has shown that slow release of Ag+ is the key to imparting antibacterial effects to coatings in the early stages of tissue implant that usually has high bacterial infection rates. While for the wet chemical deposition method, a discontinuous n-Ag coating can be formed on the surface of PLLA fiber if the deposition time is short. Therefore, it is urgent to construct a uniformly distributed and strongly-bond nano-coating that possesses anti-infection property on the surface of PLLA\/HA composite.\nAnother method, electrochemical deposition, is a non-linear technique that can enhance the adhesion between the substrate and the coating [25]. In addition, it has the functionality to prepare uniform coatings on complex surfaces and control the morphology of the coating precisely by adjusting the electrochemical parameters. However, n-Ag exhibits a high electrodeposition rate, leading to strong tendency of n-Ag agglomeration [26] and affect cell viability. The generally used electrochemical method for regulating particle uniformity is adding regulator to the electrolyte. Polypyrrole (PPy) is a conductive and biocompatible polymer that can be prepared by electrochemical method to assist in the deposition and slow release of n-Ag. Polypyrrole-nanoparticles (PPy-NPs) can be obtained by addition polymerization of \u03b1 and \u03b2 positions of pyrrole monomer (Py) under electrochemical oxidation [27]. There are amine groups present in PPy molecules so PPy is widely used in adsorbing metal ions such as Cr4+\n[28], Co3+\n[29] and Ag+\n[30], indicating the capability of PPy acting as a stabilizer for n-Ag to prevent its agglomeration. Hnida K E et al. [31] prepared PPy-Ag nanowires on alumina stencil by electrodeposition, and Ag was uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix under the action of PPy. Xie C et al. [32] prepared a HA\/Ag composite coating with good antibacterial property and cell viability by electrodeposition using PPy as a regulator. The above researches have demonstrated that PPy has the unique function of regulating uniform distribution of molecules. However, current researches are all based on the chelation of PPy amine groups with metal ions, which has the problem of poor adhesion between the coating and the substrate [33]. Marine mussels are able to adhere to any material surface through its secreted mucin, while polydopamine (PDA) is a small molecule that mimics the adhesion composition of marine mussels. PDA contains the chemical structure of catechol [34] and exhibits strong adhesion property that makes it be widely used for surface modification of substrates to improve the adhesion of the coatings.\nTherefore, in this study, dopamine (DA) was self-polymerized on the surface of PLLA\/HA nanowire composite fibers to form an adhesive PDA membrane, and then electrochemical deposition was performed with PPy-regulated Ag+ coordination and chelation to construct a stable slow release n-Ag coating for anti-infection and osteoinduction. Briefly, PDA was formed on the surface of PLLA\/HA through self-polymerization of DA. PDA could interact with PPy through hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 bond interaction [35], enhancing the surface adhesiveness of PPy composite fiber, preventing the coating from falling off. Then PPy was electrochemically deposited through the coordination and chelation with Ag+ to form a chelate, allowing Ag+ movement to the working electrode at a moderate speed. Besides, the strong electrostatic repulsion between PPy molecules has prevented the agglomeration of silver- nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), achieving stable and slow release of Ag-NPs for long-lasting antibacterial purposes. Finally, a versatile fiber with bioactivity, osteoinductivity and antibacterial properties was constructed (Scheme 1\n).\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nMaterials and instruments\nPolylactic acid (PLLA) was purchased from Jinan Daigang Biomaterial Co., Ltd., China, Mw(PLLA)\u202f=\u202f100\u202fkDa.

Then 1.44\u202fg of PLLA was added to the solution and stirred for 1\u202fh, configured into an HA nanowire-containing electrospinning solution with PLLA\/Gel weight ratio of 90\/10. The electrospinning solution was placed into a 20\u202fmL plastic syringe equipped with a medical-grade 6# stainless steel needle. The precursor suspension was adjusted using a syringe pump, and a high voltage of 18\u202fkV\u00b7cm\u22121 was supplied through a high-voltage DC power source at a sampling rate of 3\u202fmL\u00b7h\u22121. Electrospinning fibers were collected on an aluminum foil-coated rotating mandrel (20\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f13\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.02\u202fmm) placed 15\u202fcm away from the needle.\n\n\nPreparation of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber\nThe prepared PLLA\/HA was cut into squares of 2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm, and PDA was dip coated on the surface of PLLA\/HA. To achieve this, 50\u202fmL of 10\u202fmM Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) solution was prepared and the pH was adjusted to 8.5. DA weighing 0.025\u202fg was dissolved in Tris solution to make DA concentration of 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, and PLLA\/HA was soaked in DA solution for 24\u202fh at room temperature, rinsed with deionized water, and prepared into PLLA\/HA nanowire\/PDA composite fiber (PLLA\/HA\/PDA). An electrolyte solution was prepared for electrochemical deposition. Briefly, 0.05\u202fg of AgNO3 and 2\u202fmL of Py were dissolved in 1 L of distilled water to make an electrolyte solution with Ag+ concentration of 0.05\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121 and Py concentration of 2\u202fmL\u00b7L\u22121, and the pH was adjusted to 5.0 with acetic acid. To perform the electrochemical deposition, the 2\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm PLLA\/HA\/PDA was used as cathode, platinum was anode, and saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. Samples were placed in a three-electrode electrolytic cell with a conduction time of 2\u202fh and a pulse width of 100\u202fs at room temperature to prepare PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber.\n\n\nContact angle and surface energy test\nThe water contact angle was obtained by differential ellipse fitting. The surface free energy was calculated using the Fowkes equation, also known as the \u201cone-liquid method\u201d, which is one of the most commonly used surface energy calculation methods in industry. The reported contact angle was the average of 12 measurements.\n\n\nBioactivity test\nThe samples were cut into squares of 20\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202fmm, weighed and placed in 37\u202f\u00b0C, 40\u202fmL, twice the simulated body fluid (SBF) for mineralization (n\u202f=\u202f3 for each experimental group). The ingredient of SBF is shown in Table S1, and SBF was replaced every 24\u202fh. Samples were taken out at different mineralization time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 10\u202fdays) and soaked in 400\u202fmL of deionized water overnight to remove soluble inorganic ions. After drying at room temperature for 72\u202fh, samples were weighed again and spray coated with gold to increase surface conductivity, and the morphology of the composite fiber after mineralization was observed with a SEM. The mineralization quantity of apatite on the fiber surface was represented by the increase of fiber mass after mineralization.\n\n\nIon release test\nThe composite fibers were soaked in 40\u202fmL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH\u202f=\u202f7.4) for 10\u202fdays at 37\u202f\u00b0C to investigate the release profile of Ag+. The absorbance of the leachate (Table S2) was measured by AAS and the concentration of Ag+ in the leachate was calculated from its standard curve. The physiological stability of the composite fibers was determined accordingly.\n\n\nAntibacterial property test\nThe strains used for antibacterial test were Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Both strains were tested in four experimental groups, including PLLA\/HA, PLLA\/HA\/Ag, PLLA\/HA\/PPy\/Ag, and PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag (n\u202f=\u202f3 for each experimental group).\nFor the qualitative analysis, stains of E. coli and S. aureus were inoculated on MH medium separately for activation culture. Then appropriate amount of each strain was acquired and placed in physiological saline to prepare 10\u202fmL bacterial suspensions with a concentration of 0.5 McFarland unit (0.5 MCF, 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f108 cell\u00b7mL\u22121). Suspensions of each strain with volume of 50\u202f\u03bcL were taken out, seeded on a plate and cultured at 37\u202f\u00b0C in an incubator for 24\u202fh.\nFor the quantitative analysis, the antibacterial rate of the sample was calculated to indicate the antibacterial properties of the material. Briefly, the strains were inoculated on MH medium and the process was repeated three times to obtain purified colonies. The samples to be tested were placed under ultraviolet light for 1\u202fh to kill bacteria on the sample surfaces before transferred to a glass slide in a Petri dish. In order to prevent the evaporation of the bacterial suspension, sterile water was added to cover the bottom of the Petri dish. Single colony bacteria were scraped off with the inoculating loop, and the bacterial suspension of 0.5 MCF was prepared using physiological saline. 50\u202f\u03bcL of the bacterial suspension was dropped onto the surface of the sample, and cultured in a 37\u202f\u00b0C incubator for 24\u202fh. Then 20\u202f\u03bcL of the remaining bacterial suspension on the surface of the sample was taken out and seeded on a plate, and the number of colonies was counted after 24\u202fh of culture. The antibacterial rate of the sample was calculated to indicate the antibacterial properties of the material. Three parallel experiments were performed to calculate the average antibacterial rate. The calculation method is shown in Eq. (1),\n\n(1)\n\n\nAntibacterial\n\nr\na\nt\ne\n=\n\n\nCCCG\n-\nC\nC\nE\nG\n\n\nCCCG\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n%\n\n\n\nwhere CCCG is the colony count of the control group and CCEG is the colony count of the experimental group.\n\n\nIn vitro evaluation of osteoblasts\nOsteoblasts were harvested from the calvarial bone of newborn (2\u202f~\u202f3\u202fdays old) Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, and all procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\nAnimals were divided into 4 experimental groups, including PLLA\/HA, PLLA\/HA\/Ag, PLLA\/HA\/PPy\/Ag, and PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag (n\u202f=\u202f7 for each experimental group). The samples were placed in a culture plate, and osteoblasts were seeded on the surface of the samples at a seeding density of 3.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f104 cell\u00b7mL\u22121 with 3.0\u202fmL of \u03b1-MEM medium added to each well, and cultured at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. After 1, 3, 5, and 7\u202fdays of culture, the samples were washed with PBS for three times, fixed and dehydrated, dried and coated with gold to observe the morphology of the cells. In addition, at the time point of 1, 3, 5, and 7\u202fdays, CCK-8 was used to examine cell proliferation. Briefly, 100\u202f\u03bcL of cell suspension was obtained per well (n\u202f=\u202f3 per sample), inoculated in a 96-well plate with 10\u202f\u03bcL of CCK-8 added to each well, and incubated at 37\u202f\u00b0C for 3\u202fh in a CO2 incubator. The absorbance of each well was obtained by a microplate reader at a wavelength of 450\u202fnm.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nA One Sample T test (assuming unequal variance) was used for statistical analysis and all data are presented as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation. The difference between two sets of data is considered statistically significant when p\u202f<\u202f0.05.\n\n\n\nResults and discussions\nThis paper has investigated the effect of HA nanowire concentration on the morphology of PLLA fibers. When HA nanowire concentration was low (\u226420\u202fwt%), the viscosity of the electrospun liquid was so high that the surface tension was greater than that the electric field force could overcome, resulting in uneven fiber thickness (Fig. 1\na). When HA nanowire concentration increased to 30\u202fwt%, the surface of the composite fiber was smooth and the diameter distribution was relatively uniform (Fig. 1b). When HA nanowire concentration continued to increase to 40\u202fwt%, the electrospun solution has lower viscosity, smaller surface tension that electric field force could overcome and the jet was easily stretched to obtain a finer composite fiber (Fig. 1c). According to literature report [36], polylactic acid molecules encapsulate the inorganic compound being added, which destroys the crystallization of polylactic acid in the composite fibers to some extent. With the increase of the added quantity of inorganic compounds, the degree of damage proceeds and crystallinity continues to reduce (Fig. S2). Studies have shown that [37,38] decreases in viscosity are always found when crystallinity of the polymer is reduced. The average diameter of the PLLA\/HA composite fibers was 221, 308, and 262\u202fnm when HA nanowire concentration was 20\u202fwt%, 30\u202fwt% and 40\u202fwt%, respectively (Fig. 1d). The HA nanowires were less than 20\u202fnm in diameter (Fig. 1e) encapsulated in, and were distributed along the PLLA fibers (Fig. 1f). This was because that during the electrospinning process, the repulsion in the charged solution was greater than surface tension as the electric field force increased. HA nanowires were oriented from random to highly aligned along the jet line, and thus were orderly wrapped in PLLA fibers [39]. In summary, the HA nanowire concentration of 30\u202fwt% is the preferred experimental condition.\nAg-NPs were added to the composite fibers to improve the antibacterial properties of PLLA\/HA. PPy molecule has an amine group, which is able to adsorb Ag+ and coordinate with it to form a complex, indicating that PPy can act as a stabilizer for Ag-NPs to prevent its agglomeration. The adhesion efficacy of PPy to the PLLA substrate is relatively low that could not prevent the coating from falling off. In order to improve the adhesion, the bionic macromolecular PDA mimicking mussel adhesion protein was self- polymerized on the surface of PLLA\/HA to improve the adhesion between PPy and PLLA fibers. This study has investigated the effect of DA concentration and soaking time on composite fibers.\n\nEffect of DA soaking time on composite fibers\n\nFig. 2\n shows PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fibers prepared from PLLA\/HA with different DA soaking time (12\u202fh, 24\u202fh, 36\u202fh). When PLLA\/HA was soaked in DA solution for 12\u202fh, only tiny nanoparticle aggregates were formed on the surface of the fiber (Fig. 2a). When the soaking time increased to 24\u202fh, the size of the nanoparticles increased significantly and nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the composite fiber (Fig. 2b). This phenomenon was due to the expanded self-polymerization time of DA when soaking time increased, during which the composite fiber adsorbed more PPy-Ag, and thereby significantly increased the size of the aggregates. In addition, the sufficient self-polymerization time of DA allowed particle morphology change to nano-spherical form. At the same time, the chelation of Ag+ with PPy was sufficient to slow down the deposition of Ag-NPs and provide adequate time for crystal growth. Besides, the strong electrostatic repulsion between the PPy molecules prevented the aggregation of Ag-NPs, causing the shape of Ag-NPs to gradually change into a nano-spherical structure, spread uniformly over the entire fiber surface [40]. When the soaking time increased to 36\u202fh, the surface of the composite fiber was completely covered by PDA (Fig. 2c). Since PDA was not conductive, the deposition of PPy was prevented and the shape of particles on the fiber surface became uneven. From the above analysis we could know that the best DA soaking time was 24\u202fh. Besides, the diameter of the nanoparticles on the fiber surface increased as well. This might due to the heterogeneous nucleation processes of PDA aggregates formation [41], during which the deposited PDA acted as heterogeneous nucleation site and inducing more PDA particles to deposit on the fiber surface, adsorbing more PPy-Ag deposits, resulting in significant increase of aggregate diameter. From the above analysis we could know that the number of nucleation sites decreased and the size of deposited DA increased along with time. The uniform distribution of Ag-NPs was critical. It can be seen from Fig. 2d\u2013f that PPy has regulated Ag to be uniformly distributed on the surface of PLLA\/HA, and Ag content gradually increased from 0.35% to 0.38% and 1.12% for DA soaking time from 12\u202fh to 24\u202fh and 36\u202fh, respectively (Fig. 2g\u2013i).\n\n\nEffect of DA concentration on composite fibers\nThe uniformity of PDA coated on the fiber surface was affected by DA concentration [42]. When DA concentration was 0.0\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121 (\u201c0.0\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121\u201d indicated no addition of DA), the fiber surface lacks adhesion to PPy, and only a small amount of Ag-NPs was deposited on it (Fig. 3\na). When DA concentration increased to 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, PPy-Ag were uniformly distributed on the surface of the fiber in a nano-spherical shape (Fig. 3b). When DA concentration continued to increase to 1.0\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, the surface of the composite fiber was completely covered by PDA (Fig. 3c), and because PDA surface was not conductive, the deposition of PPy was prevented, resulting in uneven sized particle distribution [43]. From the above analysis we could know that the best DA soaking concentration was 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121. Ag the element was uniformly distributed on the surface of PLLA\/HA (Fig. 3d\u2013f) and DA soaking concentration had a great influence on Ag content. When DA concentration gradually increased from 0.0\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121 to 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121 and 1.0\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, Ag content on fiber surface increased from 0.06% to 0.38% and 0.39%, respectively (Fig. 3g\u2013i). It can be seen from the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 3j) of composite fibers with DA concentration of 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, that the CO stretching vibration peak in PLLA was shown at 1747\u202fcm\u22121, and the stretching vibration peak of COC in PLLA appeared both at 1076\u202fcm\u22121 and 1179\u202fcm\u22121\n[44]. The shearing vibration peak of NH2 group in PDA appeared at 1526\u202fcm\u22121\n[45] and CC stretching vibration in PDA benzene ring appeared at 1499\u202fcm\u22121\n[46]. The CC stretching vibration peak of PPy appeared at 1637\u202fcm\u22121\n[40], while the bending vibration peak of PO4\n3\u2212 in HA appeared both at 607 and 567\u202fcm\u22121\n[47]. The infrared spectroscopy indicated that PDA was successfully adsorbed on the fiber surface.\nBased on the above analysis, the preferred experimental conditions are 30\u202fwt% HA nanowire, 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121 DA, and 24\u202fh DA soaking time. The hydrophilicity, physiological stability, bioactivity, antibacterial property and cytocompatibility of the composite fiber were analyzed under these conditions.\n\n\nAnalysis of composite fiber properties\n\nPhysiological stability and hydrophilicity\nComposites used as implant material require high and long-term surface stability in the physiological environment of fluids and activities. Therefore, the physiological stability of the composite fiber was examined in this study. As it can be seen from Fig. 4\na, the Ag+ release rate of PLLA\/HA\/Ag was 58.4% on day 10 in PBS. When the regulator PPy was added to the fiber, the release rate of Ag+ significantly reduced to 37.0%. The reason was that PPy was doped as a spherical template in the electrolyte to form Ag-NPs with uniform fiber surface distribution. On the other hand, PPy and Ag+ were coordinately combined to form PPy-Ag+ complex, which reduced the release rate of Ag+. The Ag+ release rate of the composite fiber with PDA added on the basis of PPy was further reduced to 31.2% because the PDA modification has improved PPy adhesion amount on the surface of the fiber, which decreased the release rate of Ag+. Therefore, the PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fibers possess good physiological stability under the dual regulation of PPy coordination and doping, exert long-term antibacterial function and are able to inhibit bone infection.\nSurface hydrophilicity is a major factor affecting cellular activities of the composite fibers such as adhesion and migration [48]. Fig. 4b-c showed the hydrophilicity test result of the composite fiber. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag had the lowest contact angle, indicating best hydrophilicity. This was because that the hydrophilic hydroxyl group and amino group presented in PDA had improved the hydrophilicity of the composite fibers [49]. It can be seen from Fig. 4(c) that the surface energy of PLLA\/HA\/Ag fiber was reduced after adding silver, because silver was easily agglomerated on the fiber surface [50], reducing the surface energy. Polypyrrole can regulate silver, making it less likely to agglomerate and maintain a small size to increase the surface energy. And with the addition of polydopamine, the surface became more hydrophilic and surface energy was increased even more because polydopamine could help polypyrrole regulate the dispersion of silver more uniformly. Therefore, PLLA\/HA\/ PDA\/PPy\/Ag fibers had the highest surface energy and the strongest adsorption capacity.\n\n\nAntibacterial property of the composite fibers\nBacteria can result in bone infection and reduce the success rate of bone regeneration material implantation [51]. Therefore, the antibacterial properties of biomaterials should be taken into consideration during material development process. E. coli and S. aureus are not only typical representatives of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but also the most common bacteria in clinical infections. In this study, the antibacterial properties of the composites against E. coli and S. aureus were investigated. It can be seen from Fig. 5\na that after 24\u202fh of incubation, the control group of PLLA\/HA had no bactericidal ability and bacterial metabolism was active on the fiber surface, forming many E. coli and S. aureus colonies. Compared to the control group, no E. coli colony was found on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/Ag and PLLA\/HA\/PPy\/Ag, while S. aureus colony number was significantly reduced, only showing sporadic S. aureus cells. This phenomenon was due to the addition of PPy, which reduced the agglomeration of Ag-NPs, increased its surface area and number of exposed Ag-NPs that could contact with bacteria, and further improved the antibacterial properties of the material. There was no colonies of E. coli and S. aureus found on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/ Ag, this was because the strong adhesion of PDA could improve the attachment of PPy and Ag-NPs on fiber surface, increasing Ag-NPs content. In the meanwhile, the regulation by PPy reduced the agglomeration of Ag-NPs and increased contact area of Ag-NPs with bacteria. Quantitative analysis (Fig. 5b) showed that the antibacterial rates of PLLA\/HA\/Ag and PLLA\/HA\/PPy\/Ag against S. aureus were 85% and 96%, respectively, and both 100% against E. coli. While PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag has antibacterial rate of 100% for both strains. The results showed that PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber has good antibacterial ability against both E. coli and S. aureus, promising for inhibit bone infections.\nAg-NPs in the composite fiber enhanced its antibacterial property. The cell membrane structures of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are different, but they are both negatively charged [52]. Therefore, the local Ag+ that around Ag-NPs in the fiber can raise the bacteria via electrostatic interaction. Meanwhile, the free Ag+ that released from Ag-NPs can also interact with bacteria [53,54]. Consequently, the local and free Ag+ synergistically inactivate bacteria enzymes and destroy membrane integrity. And subsequently, Ag+ is released from the dead bacteria and can contact with other colonies, and the above process is repeated. Therefore, Ag can maintain a long-lasting antibacterial property. Studies have shown that PDA-modified scaffolds can reduce bacterial binding [55]. Although PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber has excellent antibacterial properties, it does not affect cell adhesion and proliferation. It has been reported that 2.4\u202fwt% of Ag in the composite coating could promote proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells with no cytotoxicity [32]. The Ag content in this study was 0.38%, lower than the reported value and PPy has function of chelating with Ag+ to reduce its toxicity.\n\n\nBioactivity of composite fibers\nBioactivity is one of the most important properties for evaluating osteointegration of bone repair materials, and the indicator is the nucleation and growth of bone-like apatite on the surface of the material. In this study, the bioactivity of composite fibers was studied in SBF. It can be seen from Fig. 6\na that when the mineralization was conducted for 5\u202fdays, only a small amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of each group of fibers, and the deposition quantity was the highest on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag. When the mineralization continued for 10\u202fdays, apatite deposition was significantly increased and covered most of the surfaces of the fibers. It can be seen from Fig. 6b that the amount of apatite on the surface of the fiber was proportional to the deposition time and the maximum amount of deposition was reached on day 10. In addition, the deposition increase was significant on day 10 on PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag fiber surface, which exhibited excellent bioactivity. The high quantity of apatite deposition was due to the good hydrophilicity and great adsorption capacity of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag. According to the literature, PDA has the ability to adsorb Ca2+, which is more advantageous to the nucleation and growth of apatite on the fiber surface [56].\n\n\nIn vitro osteogenic evaluation of composite fiber\n\nFig. 7\n shows the SEM micrographs and cell cell activity map of the main functional cell osteoblasts on the surface of each composite fiber after 1, 3, 5, and 7\u202fdays of culture. As it can be seen from Fig. 7a, osteoblasts began to adhere on the surface of fibers on day 1 and adhered well on day 3. As cell culture time increased to 5\u20137\u202fdays, osteoblasts showed promoted adhesion and growth, spread well with normal polygonal morphology, and firmly covered the surface of the fibers. Osteoblasts on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag had pseudopods stretched around and increased in number, indicating better osteoblasts adherence. The CCK-8 method was used to detect the proliferation of osteoblasts in the composite fibers (Fig. 7b). On the first day of cell culture, the metabolic activity (OD value) of osteoblasts on the surface of PLLA\/HA was the highest. On the third day of cell culture, the metabolic activity of osteoblasts on all groups of composite fibers was similar, and there was no significant difference. On the fifth day of cell culture, the metabolic activity of osteoblasts on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag fibers was the highest. This might be related to the improvement in hydrophilicity of the fiber surface and bioactive functional groups such as OH and NH2. The metabolic activity of osteoblasts on the surface of PLLA\/HA\/Ag and PLLA\/HA\/PPy\/Ag composite fibers was significantly higher than that of osteoblasts on the surface of PLLA\/HA composite fibers. After cultured for 7\u202fdays, osteoblasts on PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag fiber surface possessed the highest metabolic activity while PLLA\/HA\/Ag was the lowest. This result might be due to the local agglomeration of Ag inhibited cell proliferation. In general, the metabolic activity of osteoblasts on the surface of composite fibers increased with the prolongation of culture time. PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fibers were more favorable for cell proliferation (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nBased on the strong adhesion property of PDA, this study has successfully synthesized bioactive, osteoinductive and persistent antibacterial PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber through the self-polymerization of DA on the surface of PLLA\/HA and electrochemical deposition of PPy-controlled Ag-NPs. The results showed that along with the increase of DA soaking time and concentration, the diameter of the nanoparticles and silver content of the composite fiber has gradually increased. When DA soaking time was 24\u202fh and soaking concentration was 0.5\u202fg\u00b7L\u22121, the nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the fiber surface. Based on the strong affinity of PDA and the dual regulation of PPy coordination and doping, the release rate of Ag+ was effectively reduced, which equipped the composite fiber with good physiological stability and long-term antibacterial effect. Moreover, the hydrophilic groups OH and NH2 presented in PDA has enhanced the adsorption capacity and promoted the nucleation and growth of apatite on the surface of the fiber. The antibacterial test results showed that the antibacterial rate of the PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/PPy\/Ag composite fiber was as high as 100% against E. coli and S. aureus. In vitro osteoblast culture showed that the composite fiber has excellent cell compatibility. In this study, a bioactive, osteoinductive and long-term antibacterial PLLA\/HA\/PDA\/ PPy\/Ag composite fiber was synthesized by electrospinning and electrochemical deposition, and this material showed promising applications in bone tissue repair for inhibiting bone infection.\n\n","1401":"\n\nIntroduction\nSea buckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Rosales: Elaeagnaceae) is a hardy, deciduous shrub native to Europe and Asia [1]. In Europe, H. rhamnoides is naturally distributed on river banks and coastal dunes along the Baltic Coast of Finland, Poland, Germany as well as along the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden [1,2]. Due to drought resistance, rapid development of an extensive root system, capability of holding the soil on fragile slopes, ability to fix nitrogen due to association with nitrogen-fixing symbiotic Actinomycetes and conserve other essential nutrients, H. rhamnoides is an ideal plant for soil erosion control and land reclamation [1,3,4]. Sea buckthorn berries are among the most nutritious fruits known with vitamin C contents of 360\u202fmg\u202f100\u202fg\u22121 of berries for the European subspecies H. rhamnoides\n[5] to 2500\u202fmg\u202f100\u202fg\u22121 of berries for the Chinese subspecies H. r. sinensis\n[6]. Phytochemicals from berries and essential oil produced from berry pulp and seeds diminish inflammation, have antibacterial effect, relieve pain, promote regeneration of tissues, and have anticancer and radio-protective activity [1,7\u201311].\nSea buckthorn fly, Rhagoletis batava Hering (Diptera: Tephritidae), is the most harmful insect pest of sea buckthorn berries. In the years of mass development of R. batava flies without applying pest control means, damage reach 100% [12]. As far as we know R. batava damage sea buckthorn berries only, being a highly specialized pest. R. batava species was described in the Netherlands [13] and was known only in a few European countries causing no economically important damage to H. rhamnoides, however for a long time, this species has been a serious pest of sea-buckthorn in Western Siberia and Altai Region [12,14]. In 1970, Kolomiec has described the Siberian population of sea-buckthorn flies as a new subspecies, Rhagoletis batava obscuriosa Kol. On the basis of range expansion data of R. batava and notably increased damage level of H. rhamnoides berries in the new distribution areas of the flies, Stala\u017es and Balalaikins [15] have postulated that the more aggressive R. b. obscuriosa flies from Siberia is spreading through the eastern part of Russian Federation to Central and Western Europe. There are number of environment-friendly pest control strategies that could potentially be used to keep R. batava population below an economically significant level including natural limiting factors like parasites or entomopatogenic fungi; sterile insect technique; or methods based on application of semiochemicals, for example lure and kill, push-pull techniques and etc. [16\u201318]. Moreover, semiochemicals are widely used in monitoring programs including efficiency control of pest density regulating methods [16]. Unfortunately, up to our knowledge, no semiochemicals have been identified for R. batava species.\nThe goal of this study was to identify volatiles released by yeasts colonizing H. rhamnoides berries that could have behaviour modulating effect on R. batava flies. The aims have been formulated to determine whether: (i) some yeast species populating H. rhamnoides berries could be isolated and cultivated under laboratory conditions; (ii) some volatiles produce by yeast elicit electroanntenographic responses in R. batava females and males; (iii) a blend comprised of synthetic compounds analogous to electroanntenographic active volatiles have a behaviour modifying effect on R. batava flies under laboratory conditions.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nInsects\nSea buckthorn flies used in laboratory studies, were collected in May 2018 as puparia in soil under sea buckthorn shrubs with damaged berries located in organic sea buckthorn plantation (global positioning system (GPS) coordinates: 55\u00b015\u203212.179\u2033N, 25\u00b026\u203223.049\u2033E) in Stacijava village, Mol\u0117tai district, Lithuania. Each puparium was separately placed in 14\u202fmL glass vial containing wet 3\u202fcm2 filter paper inside and corked by foam stoppers. Vials were placed in a climate chamber \u201cFitotron\u201d (Weiss Gallenkamp, UK) under 20\u201324\u202f\u00b0C, 16L:8D (light:dark) photoperiod and 65\u201375% relative humidity. Two times a week 2\u20133 drops of water were added on a filter paper to maintain high humidity inside a vial. Emerged adults were kept in the same vials in walk-in climate room under 18\u201320\u202f\u00b0C, natural day light photoperiod, 50\u201360% relative humidity and fed on 10% sugar solution in water.\n\n\nYeast isolation and identification\n\nH. rhamnoides berries were sampled from the private farm located in the Vilnius region of Lithuania (GPS coordinates: 54\u00b075\u203220.0\u2033N, 25\u00b027\u203299.6\u2033E) in the mid-September 2016. Sea buckthorn berries were aseptically collected by using scissors cleaned with 70% ethanol, placed into sterile bags, transported to the laboratory and processed within 2\u202fh after harvesting. Thirty grams of berries were placed into sterile tubes with 5% dextrose solution and kept for 15\u202fdays at a 18\u202f\u00b0C temperature. Serial dilutions were made in a Ringer (Merck authorized distributor Biotecha UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania) solution, plated on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD)-agar plates (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose, 2% agar) [19] containing 50\u202f\u03bcg\u202fmL\u22121 chloramphenicol and incubated for 2\u20133\u202fdays at 25\u202f\u00b0C. Selected colonies were applied for morphological analysis and molecular identification.\nDNA was isolated from fresh yeast culture (24\u202fh) by using a Genomic DNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics, Vilnius, Lithuania) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For identification of yeast, the regions between the 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA genes containing two non-coding internal transcribed spacers (ITS-A and ITS-B) separated by the 5.8S rRNA gene were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using ITS1 (5\u2032-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3\u2032) and ITS4 (5\u2032-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3\u2032) primers [20,21] and sequenced at Base Clear (Leiden, Netherlands). The obtained sequences were compared with those found in the Nucleotide Similarity Search database (NCBI BLAST+), FASTA network service at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, UK).\n\n\nChemicals\nThe compounds used in behaviour tests namely 3-methylbut-1-yl propionate (\u226599% chemical purity), 3-methylbutan-1-ol (\u226599% chemical purity), ethyl octanoate (\u226599% chemical purity), 2-phenylethyl acetate (\u226599% chemical purity) and 2-phenyl ethanol (\u226599% chemical purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); ethyl propionate (99% chemical purity), 3-methylbut-1-yl acetate (99% chemical purity), ethyl hexanoate (99% chemical purity) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA); ethyl acetate (\u226599% chemical purity), hexane as a solvent (\u226599% chemical purity) was obtained from Carl Roth (Karsruhe, Germany).\nD (+)-Glucose monohydrate (obtained from Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), yeast extract, peptone and agar (purchased from Liofilchem, Rosetodegli Abruzzi, Italy) were used for YPD-agar medium preparation and yeast cultivation. To avoid bacterial contamination, YPD medium was supplemented with chloramphenicol (purchased from Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany).\n\n\nSampling of yeast-produced volatiles\nThe solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) technique [22] was used to sample the headspace of P. kudriavzevii yeast strain SB-16-15. The yeasts were cultivated in polystyrene Petri dishes (\u00d8 55\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f14\u202fmm) poured with 14\u202fmL of YPD-agar for 2\u202fdays at 25\u202f\u00b0C. As control, YPD-agar plates were used for sampling background odours. Before each collection period, the routine purification of SPME fibres coated with polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene polymer (DVB\/PDMS, 65\u202f\u03bcm coating layer thickness, Supelco, Pennsylvania, USA), was conducted at 240\u202f\u00b0C for about 10\u202fmin in a GC injector. Afterwards, the needle of SPME syringe was pierced through a small hole made in a wall of a Petri dish just above the yeast culture; the fibre was pushed out from the needle and exposed to the headspace for 60\u202fmin at room temperature. After sampling was finished, the fibre was transferred to the injection port of gas chromatograph and volatiles were thermally desorbed from the fibre during 2\u202fmin.\n\n\nGas chromatography\u2013electroantennogram detection and identification of volatiles\nCoupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) was performed using a Clarus 500 gas chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and the Synthech electroantennogram detection system (Hilversum, Netherlands) [23]. The GC injector and the detector temperatures were set at 240\u202f\u00b0C. The oven temperature was maintained isothermally at 40\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, afterwards it was raised to 200\u202f\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u202f\u00b0C\u202fmin\u22121, then increased to 240\u202f\u00b0C at a rate of 10\u202f\u00b0C\u202fmin\u22121, and then maintained isothermally for 11\u202fmin. Hydrogen at the flow rate 1.5\u202fmL\u202fmin\u22121 was used as a carrier gas. Five antennae from the flies of each sex were used for the GC-EAD analysis. Relative amounts of the compounds were determined as areas under chromatographic peaks.\nThe identification of volatiles was carried out using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph GC-2010 coupled with Shimadzu mass selective detector MS-QP 2010 Plus (Kyoto, Japan) [23\u201325], The GC was equipped with Restek Stabil-Wax column (30\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.25\u202f\u00b5m, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and operated under the same conditions as described in the GC-EAD experiments, except that helium was used as the carrier gas at the flow rate 1.5\u202fmL\u202fmin\u22121. The yeast-derived volatile compounds were identified by comparison of their mass spectral data and their retention indexes with the corresponding data available from NIST version 2.0 mass spectra search programme (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) and with those of synthetic standards for the compounds indicated in the Table 1\n using the software GCMSsolution version 2.71 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).\n\n\nBehaviour tests\nA Y-tube olfactometer (14.5\u202fcm main tube, 10\u202fcm arms, 130\u00b0 branching angle, 0.9\u202fcm inner diameter) was used to test preference of flies to synthetic samples versus control [26]. Four 18\u202fW tube type lamps (T8\/840, Colourlux plus, NARVA, Germany) covered with white, mat, plastic shield (65\u202fcm length, 42\u202fcm width) at a distance of 23\u202fcm were placed in front of the Y tube of the olfactometer. Positive phototaxis is characteristic for sea buckthorn flies and the light stimulated the insects to move towards the light source. The Y tube was held at a 10\u00b0 angle upward from horizontal on a holder. The arms of the olfactometer were connected to separate glass tubes that contained the stimulus versus control. Clean air was pushed at a rate of 0.5\u00b0L\u00b0min\u22121 through each arm using a clean air delivery system CADS-4CPP (Sigma Scientific LLC, Micanopy, FL, USA).\nBioassays were conducted to test attraction of the blend comprised of ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 3-methylbutyl propionate, 3-methylbutanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, phenylethyl acetate and 2-phenyl ethanol at the ratio 42:2:30:1:8:1:4:5:7 against a control. This ratio was selected based on relative amounts of EAD-active headspace volatiles released by P. kudriavzevii. The blend was tested at 1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 and 0.1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 concentrations by dispensing 10\u202f\u00b5L of the prepared solution onto a filter paper strip (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f40\u202fmm). After 0.5\u202fmin of solvent evaporation, the filter paper strip was placed in the glass tube connected to one arm of the olfactometer. The same size filter paper was treated with 10\u202f\u00b5L of hexane and after solvent evaporation was placed in the other arm serving as control. The olfactometer was dismantled and the glassware was cleaned with hexane after each test, soaked overnight in distilled water, and dried for 2\u202fh in an oven by rising the oven temperature from 100 to 200\u202f\u00b0C. Silicone parts of the Y-tube olfactometer were cleaned with hexane, soaked overnight in distilled water, and air dried or replaced between the tests.\nMale and female adults between 2 and 5-day-old were used in the experiment. Flies were allowed feeding on the sucrose solution until used in olfactometer bioassays. Single fly was released into the Y olfactometer at the end of the main tube. Pre-choice duration, i.e. the time within which a fly must have reached the branch point, was 15\u202fmin. A fly was considered to have made a choice when the fly reached the distal end of the glass tube containing the stimulus or a solvent control irrespectively whether the fly switched arms or not before reaching the odour source. If the fly did not choose an arm within 15\u202fmin, it was considered as not making choice. The positions of the two Y-tube arms were reversed after every five tests. All insects were observed individually and used in a bioassay only once. Out of 106 flies tested 11 specimens (all of them were females) failed to make a choice (10.4%). The tests were carried out at 25\u202f\u00b1\u202f2\u202f\u00b0C, 60% RH, between 10.00 and 17.00\u202fh local time.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nNonparametric Mann-Whitney U test (Statistica 6.0, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) was applied to evaluate differences of volatile amounts between yeast and control samples. Generalised linear mixed model (GLMM), logistic regression (glmer) with binomial distribution of dependent variable (fly choice: 0, 1) was used to determine whether the effects of independent variables such as the treatment (factorial: control and stimulus), and sex (factorial: male and female) were significant. Afterwards, we evaluated the effect of treatment on fly choice in each fly sex (male or female) and for each stimulus concentration separately. The effect of the stimulus concentration has only been evaluated in the female flies. In all models, experimental replication was treated as a random variable. Statistical evaluations were carried out with program R, version 3.5.1 and RStudio version 1.1.463 (R Core Team, 2017; RStudio Team, 2018).\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nPichia kudriavzevii yeast and their odours\nBased on Next generation sequencing (NGS) results, the vast majority of sea buckthorn-associated fungal microorganisms and yeasts were described as unidentified (87.9%) and at the species level they were assigned to uncultured fungi [21]. Application of fermentation-based enrichment and cultivation techniques revealed that about 68% of the cultured yeast population obtained from the tested sample of H. rhamnoides berries, collected in early autumn of 2016, was composed of P. kudriavzevii yeast. The sequence identity match of isolated yeast strain SB-16-15 was 100% compare to that of Pichia kudriavzevii culture B-WHX-12-19 in GenBank (Fig. 1\n). To our knowledge, there are no data published dealing with direct isolation and analysis of cultivable yeasts associated with H. rhamnoides berries. P. kudriavzevii yeast have been found in significant amounts on the berries of various grape cultivars [27\u201329] on apple, pear and plum fruits [30] as well as on cherry fruits [31].\nGas chromatographic \u2013 mass spectrometric analyses revealed 39 compounds 35 of which were exclusively present or occur in significantly large amounts in the headspace samples obtained from P. kudriavzevii yeast compare to those of blank samples. The yeast released volatiles were dominated by 19 esters followed by 6 alcohols and 5 volatile fatty acids as well as by 3 ketones, 3 unknown compounds and 2 other type substances. Quantitatively, esters and alcohols contributed by 32% and 66% to the total blend amount, respectively. Five compounds, namely, ethyl acetate, ethanol, 3-methylbut-1-yl acetate, 3-methylbutan-1-ol and 2-phenyl ethanol were released at the largest quantity and contributed to 85% of total blend amount (Table 1).\nThe same compounds released at the large quantities by P. kudriavzevii yeast cultivated in malt extract broth medium were reported by Wu et al [32], except 3-methylbut-1-yl acetate comprising 3% of total content while in our analysis the ester contributed by 18% to the total composition of the blend. Taking into consideration biosynthetic origin of the compounds [22] produced by P. kudriavzevii, the volatiles derived from the carbohydrate catabolism and fermentation pathway have been detected, for example, ethanol, acetic acid and ethyl acetate; from the fatty acids biosynthesis and degradation pathway, for example, octanoic acid, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate; and from amino acid synthesis and degradation pathway like 2-methylbutan-1-ol, 3-methylbutanoic acid and 2-phenyl ethanol, while volatiles produced by terpene biosynthetic pathway have not been detected.\n\n\nElectroantennographic activity of yeast-produced volatiles\nGC\u2013EAD analyses of P. kudriavzevii headspace collections (n\u202f=\u202f10) showed that antennae of R. batava flies were able to detect 10 volatile compounds in total (Fig. 2\n).\nThere were no qualitative differences detected in EAD responses between females and males. Chemical structure and EAD activity comparison showed that all ten EAD active compounds elicited antenna responses of both females and males in nearly all replicates tested, except two aromatic compounds, namely 2-phenylethyl acetate and 2-phenyl ethanol which showed activity in two of five male and in three of five female antennae recordings, respectively. Moreover, the compounds 3-methylbut-1-yl acetate and 3-methylbutan-1-ol bearing a methyl group at the carbon 3, showed clear EAD activity, while the presence of methyl moiety closer to a functional group, i.e. at the carbon 2 in the structurally similar compounds, i.e. 2-methylbut-1-yl acetate and 2-methylbutan-1-ol, obliterated EAD activity.\nAs olfaction is essential sensory modality in insects used to find suitable food sources, oviposition sites and mates [33], ten volatiles present in the headspace of P. kudriavzevii yeasts which elicited EAD responses of R. batava flies, indicate that yeasts may have ability to modulate searching behaviour of flies towards feeding and oviposition sites. The EAD responses of flies to yeasts\u2019 volatiles are the best studied in the family Drosophilidae [34\u201337] showing that yeast species complexes specific for drosophila hosts and for host plant berries\u2019 development stages could be resolved solely based on volatile constituents [38,39] which provides base for observed preference for certain host-yeast complex affecting performance of flies. Preference for certain host-yeast complexes leads to specialisation and niche separation which in turn have impact on a sensory specialization for odours enhancing suitable habitat detection [34,36,38]. The olfactory-chemosensory part of associations between Tephritidae flies including those of the genus Rhagoletis and yeasts has received far less attention despite that Rhagoletis flies are considered direct pests of economic importance.\n\n\nBehavioural responses of Rhagoletis batava flies to the blend of electroanntenographic active compounds\nStatistical data evaluation by GLMM revealed that the independent variable treatment (control and stimulus) significantly influenced the fly choice (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f11.24, P\u202f<\u202f0.001; \u03b2 estimate control\u202f=\u202f0.39; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.61\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.21; \u03b2 estimate treatment\u202f=\u202f0.59; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.41\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.21). However, the independent variable sex (male and female) had no significant effect on fly choice (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f0.03, P\u202f=\u202f0.85; \u03b2 estimate female\u202f=\u202f0.24; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.56; \u03b2 estimate male\u202f=\u202f0.06; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.94\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.32). In the two-choice experiments, R. batava males preferred the mixture composed of nine synthetic compounds which were analogous to EAD active volatiles released by P. kudriavzevii yeasts compare to the control (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f10.563; P\u202f=\u202f0.001; \u03b2 estimate stimulus\u202f=\u202f0.773; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.35), whereas female flies showed no preference to the nine component mixture presented at 1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f0.095; P\u202f=\u202f0.758; \u03b2 estimate stimulus\u202f=\u202f0.182; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.82\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.59) but were attracted to the mixture at the concentration 0.1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.972; P\u202f=\u202f0.026; \u03b2 estimate stimulus\u202f=\u202f0.559; OR\u202f\u00b1\u202fSE\u202f=\u202f0.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.36) (Fig. 3\n).\nPaleontology and molecular evolutionary biology data suggest that yeasts and insects have coexisted for 300\u2013400\u202fMa\u202fyears [40,41] long before the origin of angiosperms, which evolved 125\u2013150\u202fMa\u202fyears [42]. The long lasting coexisting between yeasts and insect resulted in the widespread and diverse nature of the association ranging from pathogenic and parasitic to mutualistic interactions, wherein the latter relationships are based on yeasts as a food for the insects and the insects as a vector for the yeasts [43\u201345]. Yeasts produce variety of odours [22] and substantially contribute to volatile chemical profile of a habitat affecting insect search for resources [46]. Behaviour modifying effect of volatiles released by yeasts have been observed in different insect orders [45,47\u201350], while behavioural activity of berry and fruit populating yeast odours was mostly reported in dipterans with major focus on drosophilid flies mainly from the genus Drosophilla\n[34,38,45,46]. Scarce information is available for flies from the family Tephritidae [51\u201353].\nOur results showed that both males and females positively responded to the mixture of nine EAD active yeast volatiles in the two-choice experiment under laboratory conditions. Notably, females were attracted to the lower concentration of the blend compare with males most probably due to differences in response to olfactory cues eliciting search for oviposition site compare to that mediating food source finding. P. kudriavzevii were characterised as well-fermenting yeasts [54,55] and were more abundant on damaged than on intact grape berries [27]. We assume that P. kudriavzevii yeast produced odours could indicate to flies easier access to berry interior and higher nutrient quality due to presence of yeasts for adult feeding and less suitability for larval development.\nOdour-mediated interactions between yeasts and insect are complex and diverse ranging from attractive to repellent depending on whether mutualistic or harmful yeasts inhabited a substrate. There is growing experimental evidence that yeast volatiles can be successfully used in integrated pest management programmes [56\u201358]. Our present work revealed that the blend composed of nine EAD active yeast volatiles attracted R. batava flies under laboratory conditions providing background for further optimisation of the blend and development of semiochemical based trap for monitoring and control of this pest in H. rhamnoides orchards.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nP. kudriavzevii yeast inhabiting ripe H. rhamnoides berries have been successfully isolated and cultivated. Thirty-nine yeast associated volatiles were sampled and 35 identified from the headspace of P. kudriavzevii. Ten of those volatiles elicited antenna responses of R. batava flies. Nine component mixture comprised of synthetic compounds analogous to EAD active volatiles at the concentration 1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 significantly attracted males while the females showed significant preference for the mixture at the lower 0.1\u202f\u00b5L\u202fmL\u22121 concentration. The behaviour modifying effect of the mixture indicates an application potential of EAD active volatiles in pest management programs of R. batava flies.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1402":"","1403":"","1404":"","1405":"","1406":"","1407":"","1408":"","1409":"","1410":"","1411":"","1412":"","1413":"","1414":"","1415":"","1416":"","1417":"","1418":"","1419":"","1420":"","1421":"","1422":"","1423":"","1424":"","1425":"","1426":"","1427":"","1428":"","1429":"","1430":"","1431":"","1432":"","1433":"","1434":"","1435":"","1436":"","1437":"","1438":"","1439":"","1440":"","1441":"","1442":"","1443":"","1444":"","1445":"","1446":"","1447":"","1448":"","1449":"","1450":"","1451":"","1452":"","1453":"","1454":"","1455":"","1456":"","1457":"","1458":"","1459":"","1460":"","1461":"","1462":"","1463":"","1464":"","1465":"","1466":"","1467":"","1468":"","1469":"","1470":"","1471":"","1472":"","1473":"","1474":"","1475":"","1476":"","1477":"","1478":"","1479":"","1480":"","1481":"","1482":"","1483":"","1484":"","1485":"","1486":"","1487":"","1488":"","1489":"","1490":"","1491":"","1492":"","1493":"","1494":"","1495":"","1496":"","1497":"","1498":"","1499":"","1500":"","1501":"","1502":"","1503":"","1504":"","1505":"","1506":"","1507":"","1508":"","1509":"","1510":"","1511":"","1512":"","1513":"","1514":"","1515":"","1516":"","1517":"","1518":"","1519":"","1520":"","1521":"","1522":"","1523":"","1524":"","1525":"","1526":"","1527":"","1528":"","1529":"","1530":"","1531":"","1532":"","1533":"","1534":"","1535":"","1536":"","1537":"\n\nIntroduction\nLife expectancy (LE), the average number of years a homogeneous group of individuals is expected to live at a certain age, is a widely used indicator in demographical analysis [1,2]. It depends on the complete mortality profile observed in the considered population group, but not on the age structure of the population; it is therefore useful as a standardised indicator when comparing overall mortality patterns among different populations. The comparison of patients\u2019 LE with respect to their cancer-free peers is a straightforward indicator of the disease burden; it provides \u201creal-world\u201d estimations for the actual impact of cancer on the population of interest and conveys what a cancer diagnosis entails in terms of future life perspectives. Differences in LE with respect to cancer-free peers are also more intuitive concepts with respect to relative survival to express at the personal level the life-threatening implications of the disease [3,4].\nMost estimates of cancer patients\u2019 LE only refer to the time of diagnosis as an estimate of the disease burden [3\u20139]. However, its relevance is not limited to the time of diagnosis but becomes even stronger for long-term survivors. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, only one study has provided cancer survivors\u2019 LE estimates not only by sex and age at diagnosis, but also by time since diagnosis and consequently by attained age after diagnosis [10]. This detail is important because it allows to follow the patient over time and update his\/her LE conditioned to have survived up to that time and specific age. LE at a given age, for example at 70\u202fyears and after 10\u202fyears since diagnosis compared with that of healthy people of the same age and sex, is more sensible [10] information for patients than a probabilistic concept as conditional survival, often in the long term very close to 100%.\nSeveral aspects of survivorship are modified by time since cancer diagnosis and LE of patients, in particular quality of life [11]. Current and future approaches to communication of LEs to patients should be based on solid evidence [3,4], presently scant.\nThe aim of this paper was to provide, for the first time in Italy, LE estimates for major cancer types by sex, age at diagnosis, and attained age after diagnosis, and to compare them with those from the age- and sex-matched general Italian population in order to better describe the changing impact of cancer on LE over time.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nThis study used data collected by the network of population-based Italian cancer registries [8], which agreed to participate in the study and with at least 18\u202fyears of cancer registration as of December 31, 2011 (i.e., Ferrara, Genova, Modena, Parma, Ragusa, Sassari, Varese, and Veneto, representing 10% of the entire Italian population in 2010) [8,12].\nThis study included all malignant tumours (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ICD-10 C00-C43, C45-C96) and those with benign\/uncertain behaviour or in situ bladder cancers. Non-melanoma skin cancers (ICD-10 C44) and cases identified only by their death certificates or autopsy findings were excluded. Only first diagnoses of cancers were retained. The third International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) was used to identify morphology subtypes.\nData from 722,737 Italian cancer patients were extracted in January 2017 from the AIRTUM database. Those included were diagnosed during the period 1985\u20132011 and followed-up for vital status until December 31, 2013.\nIn order to obtain stable estimates, all cancers-age-sex combinations that had no relative survival (RS) estimates or annual RS estimates up to 13\u202fyears of follow-up based on less than five cases were not considered in the analysis. Therefore, the selected cancers were stomach, colon, rectum, anus, lung, melanoma, bladder, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukaemias for both sexes; breast, cervix, corpus uteri, and ovary for females; and larynx, prostate, and testis for males (Supplementary material Table 1). LE of the general population was provided by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) based on age-specific survival probabilities observed in all birth cohorts born at any time and living during a single calendar period, 2010. LE of the general population was calculated using the standard period life table method [1]. A period life table describes what would happen to a hypothetical cohort of persons if they experienced the age-specific mortality risks observed during the reference period. This assumption provides a useful representation of current mortality risks.\nLE of the general population in the period 2010 was compared with those of patients born at any time and diagnosed in 1985\u20132011. Cancer patients\u2019 LE was calculated in four steps. In step one, RS of cancer patients was estimated by the period method [13] for coherence with the population life table. RS estimates using the period approach were estimated for the period 2009\u20132011 using the survival experience of patients diagnosed in 1985\u20132011. The period estimate combined the survival of 25 different three-year cohorts of diagnosis. One-year RS was estimated from patients diagnosed in 2009\u20132011, 2-year RS from patients diagnosed in 2008\u20132010 and surviving at least one year, and so on up to the specific 25-year RS estimated from patients diagnosed in 1985\u20131987 and surviving at least 24\u202fyears after diagnosis. Interval-specific RSs were estimated using the Ederer-2 approach [14] for each sex, cancer type, and by seven age classes, in years (40\u201349, 50\u201354, 55\u201359, 60\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374, and 75\u201384\u202fyears). The first (40\u201349\u202fyears) and last (75\u201384\u202fyears) age classes were wider, the former because of the lower number of cases and the latter because of the requirement for sufficient numbers of long-term survivors to properly estimate LE. In addition, for thyroid cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, the analyses started from the age of 15\u202fyears (by 5-year age classes). Finally, for testis cancer, the first age class included patients aged 15\u201324\u202fyears. The number of cases of the selected cancers according to age class entering into each survival period life table at the first interval after diagnosis is reported in the Supplementary material (Supplementary material Table 1). The interval-specific RS of cancer patients was then derived from the age at diagnosis and the time since diagnosis. In step two, cancer-specific annual death hazard up to age 119\u202fyears, not observable using the current 23-year-long dataset, was estimated for each age class using the moving average method. Ten-year moving average was used to reach age 119\u202fyears for each cohort of diagnosis. Step three consisted of adding patients\u2019 excess mortality risk due to cancer to the general population\u2019s mortality risk to obtain their overall risk for all causes, and cancer patients\u2019 LE was calculated with the same method used for the general population [1]. In this calculation, cohorts of patients were considered as centred at the mid-point of the age class at diagnosis (ages 17, 22, \u2026, 45, 52, \u2026, 80\u202fyears). Standard errors of cancer patients\u2019 LE estimates were calculated using the delta method. Details of these first three steps are described by Capocaccia et al. [10]. The final step consisted of applying a smoothing algorithm to stabilise the cancer patients\u2019 LE values obtained after the previous steps. To this end, a third degree polynomial model was fitted to these LE values (up to a maximum age of 90\u202fyears) for each sex and cancer, with age and time since diagnosis as the independent variables and the log of the differences between the general population (pop) and cancer patients\u2019 (cp) LE as the dependent variable:\n\n\n\nLog\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\npop\n\n-\n\nLE\ncp\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\n1\n\n\u2217\nage\n+\n\n\u03b1\n2\n\n\u2217\n\n\nage\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b1\n3\n\n\u2217\n\n\nage\n\n3\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n1\n\n\u2217\nt\n+\n\n\n\u03b2\n2\n\n\u2217\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n3\n\n\u2217\n\n\nt\n\n3\n\n+\n\n\u03b3\n1\n\n\u2217\n\nt\n1\n\n+\n\n\u03b3\n2\n\n\u2217\n\nt\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b3\n3\n\n\u2217\n\nt\n3\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere age is the age at diagnosis, t is the time since diagnosis, and t1, t2, and t3 are indicator variables for the first three years following diagnosis, in which mortality risk is often very high and rapidly changing. The purpose of this model is to assure continuity of the LE function with time after diagnosis and its consistency across age classes. The model provides a very good fit of the data with a determination coefficient always >0.8 and in most cases >0.9.\nThe LE by age and time since diagnosis for the two sexes combined was obtained by weighting the sex-specific estimates with the corresponding number of cases alive at the considered time. Finally, years of life lost (YLL) was calculated as the difference between LEpop and LEcp estimated using the polynomial model, which represents the LE gap of survivors of the considered cancers with respect to sex- and age-matched cancer-free population. All analyses were conducted using Stata Statistical Software: Release 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\n\n\nResults\n\nFigs. 1 and 2\n\n show, for all cancers combined and three common cancer sites, the LE patterns by attained age of the female and male patients, according to the age at diagnosis, compared with the general population.\nThe complete set of figures including the LE estimates, by cancer, sex, age at diagnosis, and attained age are available online (Supplementary material Figs. A and B).\n\nTable 1\n reports the LE and YLL for all cancer types combined for females, males, and both sexes by age at diagnosis and at specific time points after diagnosis (0, 1, 5, 10, and 15\u202fyears).\nIn the Supplementary material, the number of cases (Supplementary material Table 1) and long-term (10-year) period RS estimates (Supplementary material Table 2) are also reported for the considered cancer sites, sex, and age at diagnosis, as the RSs are the major drivers of LE indicators. Furthermore, Supplementary material Tables 3 and 4 report the LE and YLL of female and male cancer patients by age at diagnosis for all considered cancers at specific time points (0, 1, 5, 10, and 15\u202fyears) after diagnosis.\n\nSex\nThe estimated LE of women diagnosed with any cancer (Fig. 1 and Table 1) presented some general characteristics common to most of the considered site-specific cancers. The largest drop in LE, with respect to cancer-free women of the same age, occurred immediately at diagnosis (Fig. 1). The drop in LE was highest for the youngest age classes (YLL\u202f=\u202f11.2\u202fyears for those diagnosed at age 45\u202fyears) and progressively decreased with age at diagnosis, from 9.3 YLL at age 52\u202fyears up to 3.7 YLL at age 80\u202fyears (Table 1). After such a considerable initial drop, the patients\u2019 LE tended to increase in the first few years after diagnosis for those surviving the high death risk concentrated in these years. The initial increase was progressively less pronounced with increasing age at diagnosis and disappeared in women diagnosed after age 62\u202fyears. In the third phase, the patients\u2019 LE started to decrease again, approaching but never reaching that of the general population. In the third phase, the cancer patients\u2019 loss of LE with respect to the general population was highly dependent on the attained age and only to a lesser extent on the time since diagnosis. For example, the estimated YLL of women aged 72\u202fyears diagnosed 15\u202fyears earlier (that is, at age 57\u202fyears) was 2.8, while the YLL of women the same age but diagnosed only five years earlier (that is, at age 67\u202fyears) was 3.4 (Fig. 1 and Table 1).\nThe general picture was similar for men diagnosed with any cancer (Fig. 2 and Table 1), with some differences, partly due to the different cancer site distribution. The LE of men, both cancer-free and cancer patients, was lower with respect to women, as well-known from demographic data. The estimated increase in LE during the first years after diagnosis was more marked and appeared in all diagnosis cohorts. Finally, the patients\u2019 curves of the different age at diagnosis cohorts were closer to each other compared to women, a consequence of the lower variability of 10-year RS by age at diagnosis (Supplementary material Table 2). The LEs of cancer patients irrespective of sex were closer to those for females of younger ages and tended to approach those for males of increasing ages, mostly attributable to the different age patterns of breast and prostate cancer incidence. However, the population LE for the two sexes combined remained approximately in the middle of the sex-specific LEs. This led the YLL for both sexes to remain higher than the overall YLL, in which females were over-represented. For older ages at diagnosis, the YLL of males and females became close to each other, with the overall YLL remaining between the two.\n\n\nCancer-specific patterns\nBeyond the differences between women and men, the LE initial drop (for example, YLL\u202f>\u202f2) at diagnosis was observed at each and every different anatomical site considered, except for thyroid in females and thyroid up to age 37\u202fyears and melanoma and prostate for older patients in males. The LE pattern was mainly driven by the balance between all-causes and cancer mortality. The latter had a large impact on the youngest ages and decreased with increasing age at diagnosis and time since diagnosis (Figs. 1 and 2). Due to the LE indicator, two groups of tumours with different patterns were identified. The first group was characterised by an initial drop in the patients\u2019 LE followed by an increase in the first years after diagnosis and by a subsequent decrease, as for all cancers combined; the second group showed no increase after the initial LE drop but a regular decrease thereafter, sometimes following a short plateau (Figs. 1 and 2). The first group included the considered digestive (stomach, colon, and rectum) and respiratory cancers (lung and male larynx), cervix uteri, ovary, kidney, and leukaemia (Supplementary material Figs. A and B). This was a heterogeneous group; patients\u2019 LE when diagnosed at 45\u202fyears old ranked from approximately 29.6 (cervix uteri) to 6.5 (lung male), and patients\u2019 LE after 15\u202fyears since diagnosis (attained age\u202f=\u202f60\u202fyears) ranked from 24.7 (stomach female) to 16.3 (lung male) (Supplementary material Tables 3 and 4). The second group also included all analysed cancers for young patients (Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular, and thyroid cancer) in addition to bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), melanoma, breast, prostate, and corpus uteri (Supplementary material Figs. A and B). Patients\u2019 LE when diagnosed at 45\u202fyears old ranked from approximately 38.8 (thyroid female) to 25.3 (NHL male) and patients\u2019 LE after 15\u202fyears since diagnosis (attained age\u202f=\u202f60\u202fyears) ranked from 25.6 (thyroid female) to 15.8 (thyroid male) (Supplementary material Tables 3 and 4). The YLL indicator at age 45\u202fyears was particularly high for lung cancer (24.5 in women and 29.6 in men), ovarian cancer (22.7), and stomach cancer (19.0 in women and 17.6 in men). The lowest YLL at age 45\u202fyears was estimated for the cancers defined in the second group such as thyroid cancer in women (1.7) and melanoma in men (5.9) (Supplementary material Tables 3 and 4). After 15\u202fyears since diagnosis, YLL for patients diagnosed with digestive cancers, cervix and corpus uteri, prostate, and thyroid cancers became less than two years for all or almost all age classes at diagnosis. The YLL trend over time since diagnosis was ever decreasing with different speeds according to the lethality of the cancer type and the age at diagnosis.\nAfter some years since diagnosis, all LE curves tended to overlap each other and most converged to the population values. In the long term, the patients\u2019 loss of LE with respect to the general population depended only on the attained age. At an attained age of 80\u202fyears, for example, LE of breast cancer patients varied very little (from 7.1 in women diagnosed at age 80\u202fyears to 8.7 in those diagnosed at age 45\u202fyears), both not very far from the LE of 10 estimated in cancer-free women of the same age (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe greatest difference in the patients\u2019 LE with respect to the sex- and age-matched general population was observed immediately after cancer diagnosis for each age class and analysed cancer due to the rapidly lethal course of the most aggressive cases. This initial difference was the highest for the youngest patients and progressively decreased with age at diagnosis, as young patients\u2013although they generally have better cancer prognosis than older patients\u2013had much lower mortality risks for non-cancer related causes. With increasing time since diagnosis, two different scenarios emerged. For more lethal cancers, patients\u2019 LE tended to increase during the first three to five years immediately after diagnosis. Indeed, the prognosis for survivors improved with each additional year survived, with the largest improvement in the first years after diagnosis. Patients\u2019 LE with less aggressive cancers did not show the same behaviour, as was the case for melanoma, bladder cancer, and NHL in both sexes; and breast, corpus uteri, and thyroid for females and prostate, testis, and leukaemias for males.\nYLL over time since diagnosis can be also interpreted as a measure of how close from being cured long-term survivors can be considered. For example, a proposed YLL cut-off of less than two years [10] could be defined as a threshold for cure in male colon cancer patients at nine years after diagnosis, when it occurred at age 45\u202fyears and three years after diagnosis at age 72\u202fyears. The identification of persisting YLL after many years since diagnosis was also consistent with other research [10,15]. A small but persisting patient excess risk in the cured patients with respect to the general population caused by factors linked with the cancer but that were not the cancer itself was described in a previous study [15]. This loss of lifetime can be attributed to second cancers, mostly for breast and testicular cancer [16,17], side effects of treatments, or to common risk factors shared with other diseases (for example, smoking and diet); therefore, the condition of reaching the same mortality risk of the general population may be too stringent to define the time to cure.\nThe results presented herein can be compared with those obtained from the data from the US for the period 2010\u20132012 [10]. The general population\u2019s LE was one to two years higher in Italy than in the US, and this was also reflected in the patients\u2019 LE. Taking this into account, YLL was approximately one year lower in the US than in Italian women diagnosed with colon and breast cancers (the greater difference was detected for breast cancer diagnosed at age 55\u201359\u202fyears, 4.6 vs 7, and after 15\u202fyears since diagnosis, 1 vs 3), while YLL was one to two years higher for men diagnosed with colon cancer in the US. This could be explained by their lower long-term RS, for example, 10-year RSs in 60\u201364 and 55\u201359-year-old patients in Italy were respectively 68% and 72% (Supplementary material Table 2) and approximately 61% and 63% in the US [18]. Other studies have estimated LE only at diagnosis using a cohort approach. Andersson et al. [5] used a flexible parametric model to estimate LE in a cohort of Swedish patients diagnosed with four cancer types in 1961\u20131970. Hakama et al. [19] analysed Finnish breast cancer data from 1956 to 1970. In both papers, a lower LE was estimated at diagnosis compared to Italian data. These differences can be attributable to the cohort approach and to the consequential use of less recent data to estimate the survival experience of patients in the first period after diagnosis and also to differences in country-specific LE of the general population.\nTaking advantage of data with 23\u202fyears of follow-up, the excess hazard of patients diagnosed since 23\u202fyears or more was assumed to remain asymptotically constant at the value observed around 2010 and estimated by moving averages. Other methods can be used for extrapolating survival beyond the available follow-up time. Hakama et al. [19] assumed excess mortality to reach zero (statistical cure) or to stabilise to a constant. Andersson et al. [5] used a flexible parametric model and Fang et al. [20] used a semi-parametric distribution for survival. Nonetheless, a non-parametric estimation method was preferred as it is simpler and free from model specifications and other parametric assumptions. By prioritising the use of information from the latest follow-up years, the period approach provides more reliable predictions than the cohort method, which does not provide sufficient follow-up for more recently diagnosed patients. Despite these advantages, the LE estimates of patients diagnosed before 2011 can change in future scenarios, as the prognosis of many cancers is ever improving [8]. Unfortunately, in this database, the information on cancer stage, cancer treatment, lifestyle, and socio-economic status was not available, although it also plays an important role in determining cancer patients\u2019 LE [9].\nA limitation was related to the representativeness of the present results at the national level, as the long-established cancer registries contributing to this study covered only 10% of Italy. Variability of LE across regions cannot be excluded, although the cancer registries were well distributed across all Italian areas [8]. The generalisation of the results herein presented to other countries requires caution albeit the Italian survival levels were similar to those of most central and southern European countries [21].\nFor cancer patients, the consideration of quality of life is also very important, even more so than the length of life itself [11], but unfortunately this indicator could not be retrieved from population-based cancer registries.\nSurvivorship care is an important research topic [22]; country-specific detailed estimates and projections of the numbers of persons living after different cancer diagnoses [23], cancer cure [24], time to cure [25], and \u201creal-word\u201d estimates of the impact of cancer on specific populations are particularly relevant to policy makers. Changes in LE during the course of the disease can provide a different and complementary point of view in investigating cancer cures with respect to the RS-based criteria, providing helpful information of the lifetime impact of a cancer diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nProviding quantitative data is essential to better define clinical follow-up, plan health care resources allocation, and optimal long-term cancer surveillance. The longer the time since diagnosis, the higher the impact of other factors, in addition to the tumour itself, on cancer survivors\u2019 duration (and quality) of life. These \u201creal-world\u201d indicators are easily understandable, and therefore, they become useful measures to be adopted in the clinician-patient communication, especially after many years since diagnosis.\n\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n","1538":"\n\nIntroduction\nFor complicated underground environments and concealed engineering, it is important to study the durability of tunnel structures. For a typical reinforced concrete structure, their durability is generally analyzed via methods used to study reinforced concrete structures. Generally, for a reinforced concrete structure, chloride-induced corrosion is harmful, and the cost required for its repair is high. Thus, in this study, the chloride-induced corrosion of a tunnel structure was investigated. When structural damage due to reinforcement corrosion becomes evident, deterioration occurs at a late stage, and it may be too late to take preventive or protective measures. Therefore, predicting the service life of tunnel structures according to the extent of damage due to corrosion is important [1].\nAccording to the corrosion mechanisms of reinforced concrete structures [2], the initiation period, which corresponds to the process of chloride ions penetrating concrete, is the main corrosion stage. Thus, the period of the initial stage has been regularly used to specify the service life of reinforced concrete structures. The initiation period is the time taken for chloride-induced corrosion from the surface to be observed at the concrete cover depth [3]. In traditional methods [4,5], by using the chloride-induced corrosion depth computed via an empirical deterioration model, the service life of a reinforced concrete structure can be obtained. Many studies on the chloride-induced corrosion of reinforced concrete structures have employed the empirical deterioration model based on the chloride-ion diffusion method, e.g., the large research projects dealing with chloride-induced corrosion called \u201cHETEK (High quality concrete, the Contractors TEChnology)\u201d [6] and \u201cCHLOROTEST (Resistance of Concrete to Chloride Ingress \u2013 From Laboratory Tests to In-field Performance)\u201d [7], the computer program for predicting the service life of reinforced concrete called \u201cLife-365\u201d [8], and other studies dealing with chloride penetration for large reinforced concrete structures [9\u201314]. Moreover, the chloride-ion diffusion method has been employed in studies on the chloride-induced corrosion of tunnel structures, e.g., the large research projects dealing with chloride-induced corrosion of tunnels called \u201cDARTS (Durable and Reliable Tunnel Structures)\u201d [15] and \u201cDuraCrete (Durability design of conCrete structures)\u201d [16]. The empirical deterioration model is generally constructed by using the chloride-ion diffusion theory. For this type of model, some parameters must be determined according to experimental results. Moreover, to construct the model, assumptions must be made. To determine the parameters simply and to use them easily, for this type of model, the considered factors must be certain and few. Because the empirical deterioration model is constructed under ideal experimental conditions, this type of method cannot consider complicated engineering uncertainty factors [17]. Thus, to predict the chloride-induced corrosion of reinforced concrete structures, artificial intelligence methods based on data analyses were applied.\nFirst, the chloride permeability of concrete was predicted using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and other methods (decision tree and hybrid methods). For example, in the study of Bo\u011fa et al. [18], with data from laboratory tests, the chloride permeability of concrete containing ground-granulated blast furnace slag and calcium nitrite-based corrosion inhibitors was predicted using a four-layered feedforward neural network considering four factors: the cure type, curing period, blast furnace slag ratio, and corrosion inhibitor ratio. Using laboratory test data, Ghafoori et al. [19] predicted the chloride permeability of self-consolidating concrete through a four-layered feedforward neural network. Six factors were considered: the cementitious material content, water-to-cementitious material ratio, coarse-aggregate content, fine-aggregate content, amount of air-entraining admixture, and high-range water reducer. In the study of Inthata et al. [20], by using the datasets of laboratory tests, the chloride permeability of concrete containing ground pozzolans was predicted by a four-layered feedforward neural network considering six factors: the water-to-binder ratio, percent replacement, testing age, pozzolans type, aggregate-to-cement ratio, and actual compressive strength. Yasarer and Najjar [21] used datasets from laboratory tests to predict the chloride permeability of Kansas concrete mixes via a three-layered feedforward neural network considering six factors: the oven dry weight, saturated surface dry weight, weight in water, curing time, specific gravity, and percentage of water absorbed. In another study, in contrast to the foregoing studies using ANNs, the chloride permeability of concrete was predicted via the decision-tree method considering three factors: the water content, cement content, and high-calcium fly ash content [22]. Moreover, a hybrid method using support vector regression and particle swarm optimization was applied to data samples from laboratory tests for predicting the chloride permeability of concrete containing metakaolin; the model considered six factors: the test time, coarse-aggregate, fine-aggregate, metakaolin, water, and cement contents [23].\nSecond, because the concentration of chloride ions and chloride diffusion coefficient significantly influence the chloride permeability of concrete, ANNs have been used to determine these factors as well; datasets from laboratory tests have also been used for this purpose. For example, Peng et al. [24] predicted the concentration of chloride ions of concrete using a three-layer cascade-correlation neural network that considered five factors: the contents of cement, fly ash, and microsilica; the volume of the calcium nitrite solution; and the test time. Moreover, a three-layered feedforward neural network [25] and a single adaptive linear network [26] were used to determine the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete considering factors such as the water-to-binder ratio, unit content of cement, amount of concrete mix, and environmental conditions.\nThird, more complicated chloride-induced corrosion problems have been analyzed through artificial intelligence methods based on the analysis of laboratory experimental data. For example, four-layered feedforward neural networks were used to determine the relationship between the chloride diffusion coefficient and the concrete mix design in carbonated and noncarbonated concretes. This study considered factors such as the water-to-binder ratio, the silica fume content, and experimental data. Thus, the influence of carbonation on the chloride penetration in concrete was investigated [27]. Furthermore, considering eight factors (the contents of ordinary Portland cement, fly ash, silica fume, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregates, and fine aggregates, as well as the water\u2013binder ratio), an ANN model was developed for predicting the durability of high-performance concrete expressed in terms of the total charge passed through the concrete over a 6-h period [28].\nHowever, the aforementioned studies only analyzed the chloride-induced corrosion of concrete. ANNs have also been used to predict the service life of concrete. In a study by Hodhod and Ahmed [29], using experimental test data and results obtained from the error function solution to Fick\u2019s second law of diffusion, a three-layer ANN whose inputs included values of the concrete cover depth, apparent chloride diffusion coefficient, chloride threshold, and surface chloride concentration was applied to study the corrosion initiation time of slag concrete exposed to chlorides.\nAn analysis of the previous studies indicates that for the extremely complicated corrosion environments, the underground structures cannot be investigated using artificial intelligence methods. The ANN is the most commonly used artificial intelligence method, and only datasets from laboratory tests have been applied. However, the chloride-induced corrosion model constructed by an ANN is a network model that is described by an implicit expression. Because the ANN model is not an explicit expression and cannot be described by a mathematical function, to use this model, it must be trained beforehand by the data samples. Thus, the ANN model cannot be used directly, and this approach cannot be easily popularized. In this study, according to data from real engineering examples, genetic programming (GP) was used to predict the service life of tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion considering 17 engineering corrosion influence factors belonged to just one classification of engineering factors. An explicit expression for the service life of tunnel structures was obtained, which is a definite mathematical function. Thus, a new service-life model for tunnel structures using GP is proposed that can be easily popularized in real tunnel engineering. This study is a novel effort to predict the service life of tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion, and can be applied to more complicated chloride-induced corrosion with the consideration of more engineering corrosion influence factors.\n\n\nChloride corrosion mechanism and chloride corrosion factors of tunnel structures\nFor the service environment of tunnel structures, sources of chloride ions are widely available [30]. The sources include permeated highway deicing salt, natural chlorine salt from salt lakes or saline-alkali soil, corrosive products from industrial activities, and salt from cement adulterating agents. In particular, for undersea tunnels, the main source is salt from seawater. Chloride ions in the tunnel environment can enter the tunnel structure in different manners, including diffusion, convection, penetration, adsorption, and electromigration. For different service environments of tunnel structures, the transmission modes of chloride ions in the tunnel structure are different, and transmission may occur via only one mode or a combination of several modes. The transmission methods of chloride ions for different service environments of tunnel structures are presented in Table 1\n.\nAs chloride ions entering a tunnel structure accumulate and attain the critical concentration, on the surface of reinforcing steel bars, the passive film of the reinforcing steel is destroyed owing to the depassivation ability of the chloride ions. Thereafter, the steel rusts. Because of the expansive force caused by the rusting of the steel, the lining structure of the tunnel cracks and breaks, and the service life of the tunnel structure is reduced. During the chloride corrosion process, chloride ions are one type of catalyzer that can stimulate and accelerate the rusting and expansion of the reinforcing steel in a tunnel structure. According to the aforementioned analysis on chloride corrosion of tunnel structures, the chloride ions accumulating on the structure surface was the first step of chloride corrosion which was mainly one physical process and affected by the external environments of the tunnel engineering. The second step was the chloride entering the structure and transmission in the structure which was the main process of the chloride corrosion and was the physical and chemical process determined by the characteristics of the chloride ions and the structure cement. The last step was the structure destruction which was the chemical and mechanical process. This process was mainly determined by the mechanical characteristics of the tunnel structure, which were related with the loading and structure features. The chloride corrosion mechanism for tunnel structures is shown in Fig. 1\n.\nAs a typical reinforced concrete structure, the tunnel structure has the same basic chloride corrosion mechanism as other reinforced concrete structures. To avoid reiteration and consider the length restriction, the chloride corrosion mechanism of the tunnel structure is simply introduced here. The detailed chloride corrosion mechanism of reinforced concrete structures can be found in the literatures. According to the aforementioned chloride corrosion mechanism and previous studies [31], the main factors that affect the chloride corrosion of tunnel structures can be divided into four groups. The first group includes the external corrosion environment factors of the tunnel engineering, such as the average annual temperature, average annual relative humidity, and design speed of the tunnel, which correspond the temperature environment, humidity environment, and air flow environment. The second group includes the factors related with the characteristics of the chloride ions, such as the critical chloride-ion ratio, surface chloride-ion ratio, initial chloride-ion ratio, chloride diffusion coefficient, and chloride-ion binding capability. The third group includes the factors related with the characteristics of the structure cement, such as the water-cement ratio for the tunnel structure, thickness of the concrete cover for the structure, depth of the convective region, stray current intensity, and degradation coefficient of the lining structure. The last group includes factors which determine the mechanical characteristics of the tunnel structure, such as the rock mass grading of the tunnel, burial depth of the tunnel, lining thickness of the tunnel, and clear width of the tunnel inner diameter. To see clearly, the main factors that affect the chloride corrosion of tunnel structures are presented in Table 2\n.\n\n\nConstruction of service-life prediction model for tunnel structures using GP\nGP is an evolutionary computation algorithm that was first proposed by the American scholar Koza in the 1990s [32]. With GP, a mathematical model to describe engineering phenomena can be constructed. Then, GP can be used as a suitable pattern-recognition method in many engineering fields [33]. Therefore, in this study, GP was used to construct a new service-life model for tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion. The computation process of this new method is as follows.\n\n(1)\nSelection of the controlling parameters\n\n\n\nTo apply GP, certain controlling parameters must be determined by the user. These parameters include the reproduction, crossover, and mutation probabilities, the number of individuals, the termination error \n\n\u03b5\n\n, and the maximum number of evolutionary generations. The aforementioned parameters affect the performance of GP. If an unfavorable choice of GP input parameters occurs, the convergent speed will become low and it may be not convergent. However, studies on the selection of the parameters indicate that they can be determined according to past experience and testing.\n\n(2)\nGeneration of the initial population\n\n\n\nThe initial population is generated according to the data samples. In GP, the individual describes one function form, which includes one function set \n\nF\n=\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n1\n\n,\n\nf\n2\n\n,\n\nf\n3\n\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\nf\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (number is n), and one terminator set \n\nM\n=\n{\n\na\n1\n\n,\n\na\n2\n\n,\n\na\n3\n\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\na\nm\n\n}\n\n (number is m). The function set includes arithmetic symbols, mathematical functions, Boolean operations, condition expressions, and iterated functions. The terminator set includes variables, constants, and even function relationships. One individual was represented by a layering structure tree. As an example, a layering structure tree describing one function was shown in Fig. 2\n.\nIn this study, an individual represents one service-life prediction model for a tunnel structure subject to chloride-induced corrosion described by a mathematical function.\n\n(3)\nFitness computation\n\n\n\nThe fitness function of an individual was generally a type of transformation of its objective function. The fitness value computed by the fitness function was the criterion used to evaluate the quality of an individual. In this study, the fitness value is the error between the real service life and the computed value via the prediction model for the tunnel structure, which is described as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\nF\n=\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\n(\n\nT\n\nri\n\n\n-\n\nT\n\nci\n\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere Tri\n and Tci\n are the values of the real and computed service lives of the tunnel structure, respectively, whose units are years. n is the number of samples.\n\n(4)\nEvolutionary operators\n\na)\nReproduction operator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on a reproduction probability determined by the user, one individual in the current generation was randomly selected to create a new individual for the next generation. This operation mimicked natural selection in the evolutionary process. The degree of selection reservation was determined by the reproduction probability. In this study, one service life prediction model is randomly selected to be used in the next iteration.\n\nb)\nCrossover operator\n\n\n\nThere were two steps for this operator. First, two individuals in the current generation were randomly selected according to their selection probability. In this study, the generally used roulette-wheel selection method was used, using which the selection probability of one individual was described as follows:\n\n(2)\n\n\nP\n=\n\n\nf\ni\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nM\n\n\nf\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere fi\n is the fitness of individual i, and M is the number of individuals in the group.\nSecond, based on the crossover probability determined by the user, two new individuals were created by exchanging certain parts of two former individuals. This operation mimicked the genetic recombination of the evolutionary process, and its occurrence level was determined by the crossover probability. In this study, certain parts of two service life prediction models were exchanged to create two new models to be used in the subsequent iteration.\n\nc)\nMutation operator\n\n\n\nThere were two steps for this operator as well. First, one individual in the current generation was randomly selected according to its selection probability. Second, based on the mutation probability determined by the user, a new individual was created by changing certain parts of the former individual. This operation mimicked the genetic mutation of the evolutionary process, and its occurrence level was determined by the mutation probability. In this study, certain parts of a service-life prediction model were altered to create the new model to be used in the next iteration.\n\n(5)\nTermination criterion\n\n\n\nGenerally, the termination criterion specified that the difference between the maximum and average fitness of a group should be smaller than the error (\n\n\u03b5\n\n). To avoid an infinite number of iterations, the maximum number of evolutionary generations is also specified. In this operation, the parameter \n\n\u03b5\n\n is used to control the degree of stability of the evolutionary process. If the evolutionary process is stable (the termination criterion specified beforehand is met), it stops. However, if the time to reach evolutionary stability is too long or evolutionary stability is not attained, to save computation time, the evolutionary process is stopped after the maximum number of evolutionary generations is attained. In this study, this operation is used to judge whether a suitable service-life prediction model is found and to select the suitable model.\n\n(6)\nOutput results\n\n\n\nAfter the search process is completed, the best individual is selected as the final result, which is the suitable service-life prediction model.\nA basic flowchart of the method for constructing the service-life prediction model for tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion using GP is shown in Fig. 3\n.\n\n\nVerification of new chloride-corrosion life prediction method using GP\nBefore the new chloride-corrosion life prediction method using GP was used for engineering applications, its performance was verified by comparison with theoretical models. Here, for simplicity, the three chloride-ion ratios (Cc\n, Ci\n, and Cs\n) are represented by one synthesized coefficient \u03b2, which is expressed as follows:\n\n(3)\n\n\n\u03b2\n=\n\n\n\nC\nc\n\n-\n\nC\ni\n\n\n\n\nC\ns\n\n-\n\nC\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the synthesized coefficient of chloride-ion ratios.\nThe complicated chloride-ion diffusion model can consider eight factors: the average annual temperature (T), average annual relative humidity (RH), water-to-cement ratio of the structure (W\/C), thickness of the concrete cover for the structure (c), load presented by the burial depth (Db\n), chloride-ion binding capability (r), degradation coefficient of the structure (K), and synthesized coefficient of the chloride-ion content (\u03b2). GP was used to predict the chloride corrosion life considering the eight influence factors to verify the performance of the method under complicated conditions. Thus, the function set was \n\nF\n=\n{\n+\n,\n-\n,\n\u00d7\n,\n\u00f7\n,\npower\n,\nln\n,\nexp\n,\nsin\n,\ncos\n}\n\n, and the terminator set was \n\nM\n=\n{\nT\n,\nR\nH\n,\nW\n\/\nC\n,\nc\n,\nx\n,\nr\n,\nK\n,\n\u03b2\n}\n\n. For verification, 20 samples considering the eight influence factors randomly determined by the authors beforehand, whose service lives were determined via the traditional chloride-ion diffusion model, were used, as shown in Table 3\n.\nTo obtain the service lives of the data samples in Table 3, the chloride-ion diffusion model, including the modification of the diffusion coefficient and considering several factors, was used in this study [34\u201338]. The model is defined as follows:\n\n(4)\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n-\n\u03b1\n\n\n=\n\n\n[\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nfK\n\nf\n\nRH\n\n\n\nf\nT\n\n\nD\n0\n\n\nt\n0\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\nr\n)\n(\n1\n-\n\u03b1\n)\n\n\n\n\ne\nr\n\nf\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n(\n1\n-\n\u03b2\n)\n\n\n\n]\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nwhere L is the service life; \u03b1 is the influence coefficient of the concrete age, which can be described as 3(0.55\u202f\u2212\u202fW\/C); and f is the influence coefficient of the load, which can be determined as follows. If Db\n\u202f>\u202f500, it is 1.1; if 500\u202f>\u202fDb\n\u202f>\u202f200, it is 1.0; if 200\u202f>\u202fDb\n\u202f>\u202f50, it is 0.9; and if 50\u202f>\u202fDb\n, it is 0.8. D\n0 and t\n0 are the benchmark content and time, respectively, and are given as D\n0\u202f=\u202f10\u221212.06+2.4\n\nW\n\n\/\n\nC\n (m2\/s) and t\n0\u202f=\u202f28 (days); fRH\n is the influence coefficient of the relative humidity, which can be expressed as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n+\n\n\n\n(\n1\n-\nR\nH\n)\n\n4\n\n\n\n(\n1\n-\nR\n\nH\nc\n\n)\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n1\n\n\n\n; RHc\n\u202f=\u202f0.75 is the critical relative humidity; fT\n is the influence coefficient of the temperature, which is expressed as \n\n\nT\n\nT\n0\n\n\n\ne\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nT\n0\n\n\n-\n\n1\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n; T0\n\u202f=\u202f145\u202f (\u2103) is the benchmark temperature; and q is the cement activation constant, which is related to W\/C and given as q\u202f=\u202f3474.28\u2013159.28exp[(W\/C-0.4)\/0.09]. The other parameters can be found in the foregoing sections.\nThe theoretical model is a complex chloride-ion corrosion model that considers eight factors and employs the basic chloride-ion diffusion principle. Thus, this model can only analyze the basic chloride-ion corrosion process and cannot be used in real engineering applications. The objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of GP for constructing a complex chloride-ion corrosion model. The lives computed using Eq. (4), which are presented in Table 3, were regarded as the real lives. According to experience and tests, the main parameters of GP were determined as follows: the number of individuals was 100, the reproduction probability was 0.1, the crossover probability was 0.9, the mutation probability was 0.05, \n\n\u03b5\n\n was 10\u22125, and the maximum number of evolutionary generations was 100.\nAccording to research experience, for the artificial intelligence method, the training samples were selected from the whole set of data samples randomly, and their number was generally 70%\u201380% of the total number of samples. The remaining samples were the testing samples. Because the data samples in Table 3 were randomly selected, for simplicity, the first 15 samples (called training samples) in Table 3 were used to construct the prediction model, and the last five (called testing samples) were used to verify the model. Using data from the training samples in Table 3, the GP model was trained. The evolutionary processes of the best and average fitness were shown in Fig. 4\n.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the best and average fitness increased rapidly and stabilized as the evolutionary generation increased. Therefore, the search process of GP was satisfactory.\nAfter the search process of GP was completed, the best individual was selected as the final result. Then, the suitable prediction model considering eight influence factors was obtained as follows:\n\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n=\n0.00033\n\u00d7\n{\n(\n101.15\n\u03b2\n-\n4.113\n)\n\u00d7\n(\n2.01\n+\nsin\n2.001\nc\n)\n\u00d7\n[\n4\nx\n\u00d7\n(\n101.15\n\u03b2\n-\n2\n)\n]\n+\n5.5\n\u00d7\nT\n\u00d7\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\nsin\n10\nr\n\u00d7\nK\n\u00d7\n\n[\nsin\n\n(\n101.15\n\u03b2\n-\n2\n)\n\n+\n4\n\nD\nb\n\n]\n\n\u00d7\n\n(\n100\nR\nH\n+\n335.01\n\u00d7\n\nW\nC\n\n+\n0.035\n)\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere t is the life, and the other parameters can be found in the foregoing sections.\nUsing the above prediction model, the computed lives were compared with the supposed real lives (theoretically calculated by Eq. (4)) for the training samples, as shown in Table 4\n.\nFrom Table 4, the computed results correlated well with the supposed real lives, and the average relative error was 0.13. Thus, for the training samples, the computational performance of the prediction method using GP was suitable.\nTo verify the prediction method using GP, the lives of the five testing samples were computed. Comparisons of the computed lives and supposed real lives of the testing samples are shown in Fig. 5\n.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, for the five testing samples, the lives computed using the prediction method agreed well with the supposed real lives. That is, using the prediction method employing GP, a suitable prediction of the service life considering complicated chloride corrosion conditions was obtained. Thus, GP can be used to predict the service life of tunnel structures considering complicated chloride corrosion conditions.\n\n\nEngineering application of new chloride corrosion life prediction method\n\nPrediction of chloride corrosion life for real tunnel structures\nAccording to the foregoing verification study, the new method can be employed to accurately predict the chloride corrosion life of tunnel structures using only data samples. Thus, the new method was used to predict the service life of a real tunnel structure subject to chloride-induced corrosion. To predict the service life of a real tunnel structure subject to chloride-induced corrosion using GP, typical engineering examples were collected as data samples. In this study, according to the main influence factors listed in Table 2, 25 tunnel engineering examples involving a chloride corrosion environment collected from the related literatures were applied, as summarized in Table 5\n\n\n1\nData were collected from references supplied as Suppl. Materials.\n\n\n1\n.\nBased on the engineering examples in Table 5, a chloride corrosion life prediction model considering all 17 main influence factors (T, RH, W\/C, c, x, S, r, K, Cs\n, Cc\n, Ci\n, Dc\n, Db\n, W, L, Q, and V) was constructed. Here, the function set was \n\nF\n=\n{\n+\n,\n-\n,\n\u00d7\n,\n\u00f7\n,\npower\n,\nln\n,\nexp\n,\nsin\n,\ncos\n}\n\n, and the terminator set contained 17 influence factors. The first 20 samples (called training samples) were used to construct the prediction model. The last 5 samples (called testing samples) were used for prediction. Based on experience and tests, the main parameters of GP were determined as follows: the number of individuals was 300, reproduction probability was 0.1, crossover probability was 0.9, mutation probability was 0.05, \n\n\u03b5\n\n was 10\u22125, and the maximum number of evolutionary generations was 200.\nUsing data from the training samples in Table 5, the GP algorithm was trained. The evolutionary processes of the best fitness and average fitness were shown in Fig. 6\n.\nAs indicated by Fig. 6, the evolutionary processes of the best fitness and average fitness approached stability as the evolutionary generation increased. Thus, the stability of the evolutionary process for the life prediction method considering 17 influence factors was satisfactory.\nAfter the search process of GP was over, the best individual was selected as the final result. Then, the chloride corrosion life prediction model considering 17 influence factors could be obtained as follows:\n\n(6)\n\n\nt\n=\n54.0878\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsin\n(\nK\n-\n8\n)\n\n17\n\n-\n\ne\n\n\n\nC\nc\n\n-\n0.04\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n\n-\n\ne\n\n\n\nC\ni\n\n-\n25\n\n25\n\n\n-\nsin\n\n\nW\n-\n6.5\n\n\n9.1\n\n\n+\ncos\n\n\nS\n+\n21.31\n\n\n13.24\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\n+\n54.5352\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n=\n\ne\n\n\nc\n-\n0.01\n\n\n0.053\n\n\n\n+\n\ne\n\n\nT\n-\n9.8\n\n\n14.35\n\n\n\n+\n\ne\n\nV\n50\n\n\n-\nln\n\n\nRH\n-\n0.49\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n-\nsin\n\n\nr\n-\n0.2\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n+\nsin\n\n\nx\n-\n0.4\n\n\n13.1\n\n\n\u00d7\nsin\n\n\n\nC\ns\n\n-\n0.1\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nsin\n\n\n\nW\nC\n\n-\n0.25\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n+\ncos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\nb\n\n+\n24\n\n798\n\n\n\n\n+\nsin\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n-\n7.5\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n-\nln\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n-\n24\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n+\n\ne\n\n\n\nD\nc\n\n+\n17.31\n\n\n321.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt is life, and the other parameters can be found in the foregoing sections.\nTo verify the computational performance of the new chloride corrosion life prediction model, the computed and real lives of the tunnel structures for the training samples in Table 5 were compared, as shown in Table 6\n.\nAs indicated by Table 6, the computed results obtained using the new prediction model agreed well with the real lives, and the average relative error was small (0.0366). Therefore, the computation performance of the proposed chloride corrosion life prediction model was satisfactory.\nMoreover, to verify the prediction performance of the model, the computed results for the five testing samples and their corresponding real lives are shown in Fig. 7\n.\nAs indicated by Fig. 7, the prediction results of the proposed model agreed well with the real lives.\nAccording to the foregoing analyses, GP can be employed to predict the chloride corrosion life of tunnel structures using only engineering samples, and the prediction ability of this method is satisfactory.\n\n\nComparison study of prediction method via ANN\nBecause the ANN has been commonly used for the prediction of the chloride-induced corrosion of concrete in previous studies and is a data-based method that is similar to GP, to obtain a fair comparison, an ANN was used to predict the chloride corrosion life for a tunnel structure in this study. To validate the performance of the proposed GP method, the prediction results obtained using an ANN were compared with those of the GP method.\nThrough experience and testing, the construction of the ANN was selected as 17-27-1, which describes the number of neurons in the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively. The ANN was trained using the modified backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Thus, the ANN was a three-layer feedforward BP network. Its computation parameters were as follows: the iterating step and inertia parameter were 0.21 and 0.91, respectively; the termination error and maximum iteration number were set as 10\u22124 and 1000, respectively. Although these parameters affect the performance of the ANN, according to previous studies on their selection, they are generally determined via experience and testing.\nFor comparison, similar to the aforementioned studies for the data samples, the first 20 samples were selected as training samples and were used to construct the prediction model. The last five samples were the testing samples used to verify the model. The training samples were used to construct the ANN model, and the termination error for the ANN model was 0.0041. To compare the computational effect between the two methods (ANN and GP), the average relative errors of the training and testing samples for the two methods were calculated, as shown in Table 7\n. For a fair comparison, the computational efficiency of the two methods was also compared, and the computation times for the two methods are presented in Table 7.\nThe table indicates that the average relative errors of the two methods were lower than 10%. Thus, the two methods can be used to predict the chloride corrosion life of tunnel structures using only engineering data samples. Their computed results were all suitable. Moreover, for the two methods, the average relative errors of the training samples were always lower than those of the testing samples. However, for the training and testing samples, the average relative errors of the GP method (3.66% and 6.7%, respectively) were smaller than those of the ANN method (4.41% and 9.23%, respectively)\u2014particularly for the testing samples. For the GP method, the computation errors for the training and testing samples were approximately 20% and 38% smaller, respectively, than those for the ANN method. Therefore, the computation effect of the proposed method was better than that of the ANN method.\nThe computation time of the ANN method for the training samples was approximately 5.4\u202fmin, and that for the testing samples was approximately 0.94\u202fmin. The computation time of the GP method for the training samples was approximately 2.42\u202fmin, and that for the testing samples was approximately 0.01\u202fmin. For the GP method, the computation times for the training and testing samples were approximately 2.2 and 93 times shorter, respectively, than those for the ANN method. Thus, the computation time of the GP method was significantly shorter than that of the ANN method; i.e., the computational efficiency of the GP method was far higher than that of the ANN method.\nFurthermore, because the prediction model based on the GP method using the training samples employed an explicit mathematical expression, when a data sample was substituted into this function, the result could be computed directly. The computation process of the explicit mathematical expression was very easy and fast. Consequently, the computation speed of the prediction model using the GP method for the testing samples was very fast. However, the prediction model using the ANN method is a network model that cannot be described by mathematical expressions. Thus, the computation speed of the ANN model was significantly lower than that of the GP method.\nConsidering the computational effect and efficiency, the prediction model using the GP method was better than the ANN model for determining the suitable service life of tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion. Moreover, the prediction model using the GP method was an explicit mathematical expression. Thus, the new method using GP can be very simply and easily applied.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nAs a typical evolutionary algorithm, there were certain controlling parameters to be determined for GP. These parameters significantly affected the performance of GP. To provide guidance for the determination of the parameters in this study, the effects of two main parameters (population size and sample size) on the performance of the chloride corrosion life prediction model constructed in the foregoing section were analyzed in detail. The sample size is an important parameter for collecting suitable data, which requires a considerable amount of effort in real engineering applications. Thus, it is important to determine the suitable sample size for a data-based method. Moreover, for GP, the population size is an important parameter that controls the computation time and results. For complicated engineering problems, the computation time is an important influence factor. Therefore, in this study, these two important parameters were analyzed.\n\nPopulation size\nAs the population size increases, the computational accuracy increases, while the computational efficiency decreases; i.e., if the population size is small, the algorithm may converge to a local extreme very quickly, and the computed result is poor. In contrast, if the population size is large, the computational expense increases significantly, and the computational efficiency is very low. Thus, the effects of the population size on the computational accuracy and efficiency were comprehensively analyzed, as follows.\n\n(1)\nEffect on the computing accuracy\n\n\n\nWith different population sizes (20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 240, and 480), the average computation errors for the training and testing samples are presented in Table 8\n.\nAs indicated by Table 8, for the training and testing samples, the influence laws were similar. As the population size increased, the computation error decreased, and the extent of the decrease slowed. Moreover, when the population size was small, the relative errors of the training and testing samples were different, and their difference was large; i.e., when the population size was small, the difference between the approach and prediction errors was large. In contrast, when the population size was large, the difference between the approach and prediction errors was small; i.e., the errors were similar. Therefore, for a large population size, the relative errors of the training and testing samples were similar; i.e., the approach and prediction errors of the new prediction model using GP were similar. According to the above analysis, with regard to the computation error, a larger population size yields better performance of the GP prediction model.\nTo analyze the effect of the population size on the computation error more clearly, the relationship between the absolute errors of the training and testing samples and the population size was examined, as shown in Fig. 8\n.\nThe figure indicates that as the population size increased, its effect on the computation error decreased significantly, according to a power function. Therefore, the method for improving the computation error by increasing the population size had an application range and was only suitable for a small population size; for a large population size, increasing it further was not effective.\n\n(2)\nEffect on the computing efficiency\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the computational efficiency of the chloride corrosion life prediction model with different population sizes (20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 240, and 480) more thoroughly, the effect of the number of objective-function evaluations during the evolutionary process, which is denoted by NOF and represents the computational efficiency for optimization algorithms [39], was studied.\nThe relationship between the NOF and the population size is shown in Fig. 9\n.\nThe figure indicates that as the population size increased, the NOF increased rapidly. The two parameters had an exponential relationship; i.e., as the population size increased, its effect on the NOF increased. Moreover, when the population size was larger than approximately 300, the NOF increased sharply. Furthermore, Fig. 9 shows that for a small population size, the effect of the population size on the computational efficiency was small. However, as the population size increased, its effect on the computational efficiency increased significantly. The computational efficiency of the new prediction model using GP decreased considerably with the increase in the population size. There was an optimal value for the population size: approximately 300. Therefore, considering only the computational efficiency, a smaller population size yields better performance of the prediction model using GP.\nAccording to the comprehensive analysis of the computational accuracy and efficiency, in this study, the optimal population size was determined to be 300.\n\n\nSample size\nAs the sample size increased, the computed results improved. However, it was very difficult to collect suitable engineering examples. In particular, for complicated chloride corrosion problems of tunnel structures, it was almost impossible to collect several engineering samples. Therefore, for the chloride corrosion life prediction method using GP, it was crucial to determine the minimal sample size. Because the sample size significantly affected the computational accuracy and only slightly affected the computational efficiency, only its effect on the computational accuracy was analyzed in this study.\nFor the training and testing samples, the average computation errors for different sample sizes (5, 10, 15, and 20) are presented in Table 9\n.\nAs indicated by Table 9, the influence laws were similar for the training and testing samples. As the sample size increased, the computation error decreased, and the extent of the decrease declined. In addition, the computation errors of the training and testing samples were all different, regardless of the sample size. The analysis results indicate that for a small sample size, the influence of the sample size on the computational accuracy was notable; however, for a large sample size, the influence of the sample size decreased. Thus, a larger sample size yielded better performance of the prediction model using GP. However, when the sample size increased to a certain value, the method for improving the computational accuracy by increasing the sample size was not effective.\nTo analyze the effect of the sample size on the computational accuracy in more detail, the relationship of the absolute errors of the training and testing samples with the sample size is shown in Fig. 10\n.\nThe figure shows that for a small sample size (<15), as the sample size increased, the computation error decreased rapidly; i.e., the computational accuracy improved rapidly. When the sample size was in the range of 15\u201320, the computation error decreased gradually. Moreover, when the sample size was approximately 20, the absolute errors for the two types of samples changed gradually and slightly. The extreme points for the two functions were approximately 20. Thus, for a sample size of 20, the computational accuracy improved very slowly or did not improve. Therefore, for this study, the optimal sample size was 20.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing data collected from real engineering examples of 25 tunnels subject to chloride-induced corrosion, a method for predicting the service life of tunnel structures via the data-based method of GP was proposed. The explicit expression of the service-life prediction model for these tunnel structures can be obtained. For 20 randomly selected data samples, using the chloride-ion diffusion model considering eight corrosion influence factors, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. Finally, using data from tunnel engineering examples, a prediction model considering 17 corrosion influence factors for a real engineering environment using GP was constructed. Its computational effect was verified with data from other tunnel engineering examples. Moreover, the suitable performance of the proposed prediction model was verified by a comparative study with an ANN model. The results indicated that both the computational effect and efficiency of the GP method were significantly better than those of the ANN method. Moreover, the prediction model using GP consisted of an explicit mathematical expression, whereas that using the ANN method was a network model. Thus, the GP model could be applied more easily. Therefore, GP is a suitable method for predicting the service life of tunnel structures subject to chloride-induced corrosion.\nTo comprehensively analyze the proposed method, the effects of two main controlling parameters (population size and sample size) on the performance of the prediction model considering 17 corrosion influence factors were analyzed in detail. The results indicated that as the population size increased, the computation error decreased, and the extent of the decrease slowed. As the population size increased, its effect on the computation error decreased significantly. Furthermore, as the population size increased, the computational efficiency decreased sharply. When the population size was larger than approximately 300, the computational efficiency decreased sharply. According to a comprehensive analysis of the computational accuracy and efficiency of the new prediction model, the optimal population size was determined to be 300. Moreover, as the sample size increased, the computation error decreased, and the extent of the decrease declined. When the sample size was approximately 20, the absolute error for the data samples changed gradually and remained almost unchanged. Thus, the optimal sample size was 20 for the new prediction model.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1539":"\n\nIntroduction\nAmong the diverse array of bacterial metabolites, the superfamily of antimicrobial ribosomal synthesised peptides (bacteriocins) is biotechnologically relevant for use as natural preservatives to extend the shelf-life of foods. They display remarkable broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including many antibiotic-resistant strains, often with EC50 values in the nano- to micromolar range. Currently, interest in peptides is increasing in pharmaceutical research and development. Approximately 140 therapeutic peptides are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [1]. Additionally, in contrast to many conventional antibiotics, most of them rapidly kill bacteria instead of just inhibiting bacterial growth. In general, this effect arises from their primary structure and properties such as positive net charge, amphipathicity, conformational flexibility, size, and hydrophobicity [2]. Although more than 335 bacteriocins have been described according to the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (http:\/\/aps.unmc.edu\/AP\/main.php) [3], toxicity data has only been determined for a few. However, available research and their long track record of intentional use in food strongly suggest that these peptides can be safely used. Bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit low toxicity against most eukaryotic cells, which encourages their re-evaluation for clinical\/veterinary use as antimicrobial drugs [4,5]. Their therapeutic potential in local and systemic bacterial infections is currently under investigation, underlining their importance as a viable alternative or addition to currently used antibiotics, considering the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance. Many bacteriocins fulfil most criteria, including low MIC values, low immunogenicity and toxicity, and low potential to induce resistance, which encourage studies aimed at marketing them as clinically relevant compounds [6\u20139]. Interestingly, some recent reports describe very potent bacteriocins produced by enterococci, such as enterocins A\u202fand\u202fB, produced by Enterococcus faecium\n[10], enterocins DD14 [11] and SL-5 [12], both identical to MR10A and MR10B [13], enterocin EntV [14] and even enterocin EF478 [15], which displays sequence similarity to a serine protease of Enterococcus faecalis. In no case has a thorough characterization of its therapeutic profile been conducted. Some studies of immunogenicity and in vivo toxicity have been reported for some lanthipeptides [16], peptide P34 from Bacillus\n[17], bacteriocins LR14 from Lactobacillus plantarum\n[18], and TSU4 from Lactobacillus animalis\n[19].\nOne of the most interesting classes of bacteriocins, based on physicochemical characteristics, is the head-to-tail circular peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria [20]. These biologically active peptides are post-translationally modified by linkage of their N- and C-termini via peptide bond, yielding circular active molecules. They represent a group of antimicrobial peptides that exhibit broad antimicrobial activity and greater stability and resistance to exoproteases than their unmodified linear counterparts [20]. For these reasons and because they closely mimic natural pathways, they have remarkable therapeutic potential in local and systemic infections [21]. Another advantage is that their mechanism of action, which specifically targets the bacterial cell membrane, is novel compared to antibiotics in clinical use, and bacteria seem less capable of developing resistance towards these molecules [4,5]. The prototype circular bacteriocin is AS-48, a 70-residue \u03b1-helical peptide produced by different strains of Enterococcus, whose structure, biological activity, and genetic regulation, have been extensively examined [22]. This peptide exhibits a strong cidal\/lytic activity against most pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes\n[23], Staphylococcus aureus\n[24]\n, Streptococcus agalactie (unpublished data), Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[25], and Propionibacterium acnes\n[26].\nThe objective of the present study was to characterise the toxicology of the circular bacteriocin AS-48, to determine if it is safe for clinical\/veterinary use. The potency it exhibited against S. aureus and P. acnes clearly indicates the potential for the use of AS-48 in treating skin and soft tissue infections caused by these microorganisms. Thus, several biosafety parameters and its functionality have been analysed using different experimental in vitro models (blood, human, and mouse cell lines) and in vivo using murine and zebrafish embryo models. The novelty of this study lies mainly in the scarcity and limited scope of toxicological analyses of bacteriocins to date, with the exception of analyses of haemolysis and cytotoxicity towards tumour cell lines. Thus, to our knowledge, this is a pioneering article in the field of bacteriocin toxicity in in vivo models.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nBacteriocin AS-48 preparation\nAS-48 was purified from supernatants of Enterococcus faecalis strain UGRA10 [26] cultured in Esprion 300 plus 1% glucose (E-300-G, DMV Int., Veghel, the Netherlands), using previously established conditions [27]. The bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity (up to 95% purity) by cation exchange and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) as described elsewhere [27]. The concentration of purified samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 280\u202fnm using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific. Waltham, MA, USA), with the molecular extinction coefficient 12 490\u202fM\u22121\u202fcm\u22121 according to Gill and von Hippel [28], the measured molecular weight 7149.5\u202fDa and the E&MW option.\n\n\nHaemolytic assays\nThe haemolytic potential of AS-48 was spectrophotometrically measured by quantifying haemoglobin released, using whole blood and defibrinated erythrocytes from 20 human samples (10 males and 10 females) obtained from the Biobank of Granada (Spain) (http:\/\/www.juntadeandalucia.es\/salud\/biobanco\/) (Public Sanitary System of Andalusia) after obtaining the appropriate permits from the Ethical Research Committees of the Biobank and the University of Granada (Application number 32130034PV01). Biological samples were used in compliance with current legislation. Blood samples from healthy human volunteers were provided in BD Vacutainer tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, Nueva Jersey, USA) with K2-EDTA as anticoagulant.\nFor the haemolytic test in whole blood, AS-48 was directly added to yield different final concentrations (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u202f\u00b5M) in 1\u202fmL of fresh blood. Tubes were slowly stirred at 37\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin, and cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000\u202frpm at 4\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin. Supernatants were diluted 10 fold, and absorbance (OD) at 540\u202fnm was measured, using fresh blood diluted 10 fold in MilliQ water as a positive lysis control.\nTo assay erythrolytic activity the protocol described by Huang et al. [29] was performed with some modifications. Briefly, 20 samples of human red blood cells were isolated from 5\u202fmL of fresh whole blood by centrifugation at 3000\u202frpm. Pellets were rinsed twice in saline solution (0.9% NaCl). The final pellet was resuspended in 5\u202fmL of saline solution. Erythrocytes were diluted 10 fold and 800\u202f\u00b5L of this suspension was mixed with 200\u202f\u00b5L of different dilutions of AS-48 samples to achieve final concentration of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u202f\u00b5M. Mixtures were maintained at 37\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin with slow stirring. Haemoglobin release was quantitated by measuring optical density at 540\u202fnm (OD540) after centrifugation (6\u202fmin at 3000\u202frpm, 4\u202f\u00b0C). Controls with 0 or 100% haemolysis were obtained by adding 200\u202f\u00b5L of saline solution or MilliQ water, respectively. The percentage of haemolysis (% H) was calculated as follows: % H\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u00d7\u202f(A\u202f\u2212\u202fA0)\/Atot, with A being the absorbance of the sample with added AS-48; A0, the absorbance of the negative control (0.9% NaCl); and Atot, the absorbance of the positive control (MilliQ water).\n\n\nAntibacterial activity in blood\nFresh blood samples (0.8\u202fmL) were pre-inoculated with 106\u202fCFU\/mL of susceptible Gram-positive bacteria species with well-known MICs (Listeria monocytogenes CECT4032, Enterococcus faecalis V583, Staphylococcus aureus CECT240 or Streptococcus agalactiae Hana-1), and the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae UGRA-1 (data not shown). These bacterial strains were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) or Luria broth (LB) prior to blood inoculation. The inoculated blood samples were added to different concentrations of AS-48 (0.014, 0.07, 0.14, 0.7 or 1.4\u202f\u00b5M in accordance with their known susceptibilities). Cultures were incubated for 24\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C with gentle shaking, and samples were taken at different times (0, 2, 4, 6, and 24\u202fh). Residual CFU\/mL of each indicator bacteria at each time point was determined to quantify death kinetics by plating them on appropriate solid media. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\n\n\nZebrafish embryos acute toxicity assay\nThe present test for short-term toxicity follows the guidelines of the OECD Draft Guideline Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) Test for the study of chemical substances (May 30, 2006) [30]. The species chosen for this test was the zebrafish (Danio rerio) wild strain AB. Breeding fish were maintained according to specifications defined in the technical instruction IT-DD-17, and production of fish eggs for assays was performed according to the protocol PT-DD12 (Neuron Biopharma, Granada, Spain).\nFor this assay, normal fertilised eggs were deposited in a 24-well microplate (10 embryos per concentration). Five final concentrations of AS-48 (0.6, 1.4, 3.0, 6.4, and 14.0\u202f\u00b5M) were evaluated, using 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) as a positive control and water as a negative control. Plates were incubated at 26\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C for 24 and 48\u202fh post fertilization (hpf), then the embryos were checked for lethal, sublethal, or teratogenic effects in accordance with procedure outlined by Lammer et al.\n[31].\n\n\nIn vitro Cytotoxic effects against human cell lines\nThe effect of AS-48 on the viability in vitro of eukaryotic cells was assessed in the Cytotoxicity Service of the Medina Foundation (Granada, Spain) using the colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay [32]. Reduction of tetrazolium to insoluble formazan by cellular enzymes generates a purple colour. Different concentrations of AS-48 (from 0.27 to 27\u202f\u00b5M) were tested against the non-tumour epithelial cells MCF10A (ATCC\u00ae CRL-10317) and colonic fibroblast cells CCD18Co (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1459). Cells were inoculated into 96-well plates (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f104\u202fcells\/well in 200\u202f\u03bcL of appropriate culture media) and incubated overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Then, the medium was replaced, and cells were treated with different concentrations of AS-48 for 24\u202fh. As positive and negative controls, 8\u202fmM methyl methane-sulfonate (MMS) and 0.5% DMSO were used, respectively, with doxorubicin as an internal control. Upon treatment with controls or AS-48, plates were incubated at 37\u202f\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 72\u202fh. The media was then removed from the wells, and MTT was added, followed by a 3\u202fh incubation period. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to solubilise the formazan crystals, and the absorbance of the obtained solutions was measured at 570\u202fnm using a multiReader Victor TM (Perkin Elmer Waltham, MA. USA). Viability data are depicted as the mean percentage\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviations compared to the control (100%). The results are averages of three experiments.\n\n\nCell viability and nitrite production in treated macrophage RAW cells\nThe RAW264.7 mouse macrophage tumour cell line was purchased from the Cell Culture Unit of the University of Granada (Granada, Spain), and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 2\u202fmM L-glutamine, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u202f\u00b0C. The effect of AS-48 on cell viability was measured using the Cell Titer 96\u202fs AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 2\u202fh with AS-48 (0.27\u201327\u202f\u00b5M), they were then challenged with 100\u202fng\/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 055:B5 for 24\u202fh to induce expression and release of cytokines\/chemokines. Then, the MTS solution [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] was added to the wells, and absorbance was measured at 490\u202fnm after 1\u20134\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a Dynex spectrophotometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA). Cell viabilities were obtained by comparing measured absorbances with the absorbance of the control cells.\nThe effect of AS-48 on nitrite production was also evaluated using cells cultured as described above. After 2-h incubation with AS-48 followed by 24-h incubation with LPS, cell supernatants were collected, and nitrite levels were quantified by the addition of Griess reagent (a coloured azo dye product). Its absorbance was measured at 540\u202fnm in a Dynex spectrophotometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA) [33].\n\n\nLocal lymph node assay: BrdU-ELISA\nExperimental procedures and protocols used in this study were performed according to the \u201cGuide to the care and use of laboratory animals in research and teaching\u201d [34]. The Commission of Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the University of Granada (Spain) approved the experimental protocol (Register number 14-CEEA-OH-2013).\nTwenty five CD1 female mice (18\u201322\u202fg) purchased from the Laboratory Animal Services of the University of Granada and maintained in Makrolon cages were provided with food and water ad libitum in an air-conditioned atmosphere with a 12-h light-dark cycle. The mice were randomly allocated into five groups (five animals per group): three groups treated with three different doses of AS-48 (20, 10, or 1\u202f\u03bcg\/mouse), a non-treated control group, and a group treated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) as positive control. Five microliters of AS-48 in the appropriate DMSO solution was applied to the dorsum of both ears daily for 3 consecutive days, whereas control groups received only vehicle. On day 5, all mice received a single intraperitoneal injection (0.5\u202fmL) of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) solution (8\u202fmg\/mL). On day 6, a pair of auricular lymph nodes from each mouse was excised to measure incorporation of BrdU into lymph node cells using a CytoSelect\u2122 BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA Kit from Cell Biolabs Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, lymph nodes were minced and resuspended in 20\u202fmL of PBS solution that had been filtered through a 100-\u00b5m mesh. Aliquots of 100\u202f\u00b5L were added to a 96-well flat bottom plate, which was centrifuged at 300g for 10\u202fmin. Seventy five microlitres was removed from each well, and the plate was dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. Then, anti-BrdU antibody was added, and the protocol provided by the kit manufacturer was followed. BrdU content in each well was measured by reading the absorbance at 450\u202fnm in a Dynex spectrophotometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA).\n\n\nIn vivo testing of AS-48 in BALB\/c mice\nAssays were performed according to rules and principles of the international guide for biomedical research in experimental animals, including use of the minimum number of animals necessary to produce statistically reproducible results, and the Three Rs concept (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). Seven female BALB\/c mice (10\u201312\u202fweeks old and \u223c21\u202fg) were selected for these experiments; they were maintained under standard conditions and provided with water and standard chow ad libitum. Four mice were treated with a total of 5\u202fmg\/kg (100\u202f\u03bcg\/mouse) of AS-48 divided into six doses and administered every 8\u202fh. Mice were intraperitoneally injected 200\u202f\u00b5L of 11.65\u202f\u00b5M (83.34\u202f\u03bcg\/mL) AS-48 dissolved in water. Three negative control mice were administered only vehicle. After the final injection, the weight of the mice was determined every 2\u202fdays.\nMouse serum samples were obtained 48\u202fh and 7\u202fdays after AS-48 treatment as described Mart\u00edn-Escolano et al. [35]. Kidney, heart, and liver marker profiles in serum samples were measured using a commercial kit from Cromakit\u00ae with a BS-200 Chemistry Analyzer (Shenzhen Mindray Bio-medical Electronics Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China) in the Scientific Instrumentation Service at the University of Granada. Finally, two AS-48-treated mice were euthanised 48\u202fh after treatment, and their spleens were harvested and weighed to evaluate inflammation. Seven days after treatment, the same procedure was carried out for the other two AS-48-treated mice and the negative control mice.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 20 (IBM, Spain). Three independent tests were conducted for each experiment, and data are expressed as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD). SPSS one-way ANOVA and LSD post-hoc test were performed for statistical data analysis. The t-test for paired samples was used to assess whether there were differences between the assays used, with P\u202f<\u202f0.05 considered statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Statistical studies based on contingency tables (prevalence) together with the \u00d72 test for relationships between variables were also conducted.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nHaemolytic activity\nThe haemolytic potential of purified AS-48 was determined by the percentage of lysed red cells using whole blood and defibrinated human erythrocytes. According to the data obtained, the haemolytic potential of purified AS-48 varied with assay and concentration used. When tested on whole blood, hemolysis produced by the highest concentrations used (20\u202f\u03bcM) was very low (less than 1.2%). Practically zero haemolysis occurred at concentrations of 5\u202f\u03bcM or lower (Fig. 1\n).\nWith defibrinated erythrocytes, the percent haemolysis was 3% at AS-48 values close to 5\u202f\u03bcM, which increased to 15.7 and 22.6% at 10 and 20\u202f\u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1). It is remarkable that lysis caused by AS-48 on defibrinated erythrocytes required concentrations much higher than those required for antimicrobial activity.\n\n\nBactericidal activity of AS-48 in human blood\nTo investigate the stability and bactericidal activity of AS-48 in whole human blood, four species of Gram-positive bacteria (L. monocytogenes CECT4032, E. faecalis V583, S. agalactiae Hana-1 and S. aureus CECT240) and one Gram-negative species (Klebsiella pneumoniae UGRA-1) were selected, and their CFU\/mL in blood was monitored over the course of 24-h exposure to different concentrations of AS-48. AS-48 concentrations were chosen based on previously determined MIC values for each bacterium (data not shown).\nA remarkable dose-dependent reduction in bacterial counts (Fig. 2\n), which varied with the indicator bacteria used and the AS-48 concentration added, was observed. Thus, 0.14\u202f\u03bcM of AS-48 completely eradicated L. monocytogenes after 6\u202fh, whereas S. aureus CECT240 required 24-h incubation. At lower concentrations (0.014 and 0.07\u202f\u03bcM) CFU\/mL decreased in the first 6\u202fh of incubation, but total elimination of these bacteria was not observed (in both cases, approximately 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f104\u202fCFU\/mL remained after 24\u202fh). To eradicate E. faecalis V583 and S. agalactiae Hana-1, 10-fold higher concentrations of AS-48 (1.4\u202f\u03bcM) were required to achieve the same effects seen with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus (i.e. eradication after 6 and 24\u202fh, respectively). These results demonstrate that AS-48 is stable in blood for at least 24\u202fh and that its bactericidal potential remains intact in the presence of blood. As expected, no inhibition of growth was observed at any AS-48 concentrations assayed with K. pneumoniae UGRA-1, which is resistant to AS-48 (Fig. 2) [36].\n\n\nAssessment of AS-48 toxicity in zebrafish eggs\nZebrafish embryos, which are very sensitive to toxins, were used to assess the safety, bioavailability, and efficacy of AS-48. Embryos exposed to low doses (0.6\u20133.0\u202f\u00b5M) did not display any visible anomalies after 24\u202fh (Fig. 3\n).\nAt concentrations <3\u202f\u00b5M, AS-48 was bio-safe even after 48\u202fh of treatment. At 3\u202f\u00b5M, oedema was produced after 48\u202fh in 33.3% of embryos (Table 1\n and Fig. 3). The lethal dose 50 (LD50) was established to lie between 3.0 and 6.4\u202f\u00b5M, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), at which no toxic or lethal effect could be detected, was 1.4\u202f\u00b5M (10\u202f\u00b5g\/mL). It is noteworthy that higher doses (6.4 and 14\u202f\u00b5M) induced 100% embryo lethality at 24\u202fhpf, during the most critical stage of embryonic development, when organogenesis takes place [37], with filamentous structures visible on the surface of the embryos\u2019 chorion. This lethality could be due to a membrane dysfunction, calcium imbalance, or outward blebbing of the cell membrane [38].\n\n\nIn vitro toxicity and pro-inflammatory effects of AS-48\nThe in vitro cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide AS-48 at concentrations ranging from 0.27 to 27\u202f\u00b5M was investigated on two primary human cell lines (CCD18Co and MCF10A) using the MTT assay, which measures the mitochondria-dependent metabolic activity of cells. At concentrations close to the MIC, the presence of AS-48 did not affect these non-tumour human-skin cell lines. No signs of viability changes were observed even at the highest concentration tested (27\u202f\u00b5M) (Fig. 4\n). Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the treated cells and the negative control, confirming the lack of AS-48 toxicity toward these cell lines under the tested assay conditions (Fig. 4).\nSimilarly, RAW264.7 murine macrophages were exposed to increasing concentrations of AS-48 (0.27\u201327\u202f\u00b5M) to assess its cytotoxicity and possible pro-inflammatory effects. The results showed that AS-48 had no cytotoxic effects on this tumour cell line at the concentrations assayed. No significant reduction in cell viability was observed in these experimental conditions (Fig. 5\nA).\nActivated macrophages can overproduce nitric oxide (NO). This phenomenon has been associated with diverse inflammatory diseases ranging from tissue damage to sepsis [39]. Thus, the potential pro-inflammatory effect of AS-48 was evaluated by measuring nitrite accumulation in the cell culture medium (an indicator of nitric oxide synthesis by inducible nitric oxide synthase, also known as iNOS, after macrophage stimulation). In fact, nitric oxide production is up-regulated in dermal inflammatory reactions, and its role as a mediator of the irritant response is well documented [39]. Incubation of RAW264.7 cells with AS-48 (0.27\u201327\u202f\u00b5M) did not induce nitrite accumulation. Nitrite levels in the media were similar in treated and control cells (P\u202f>\u202f0.05) (Fig. 5B). However, when nitric oxide production was induced by LPS (100\u202fng\/mL), AS-48 had a moderating effect, decreasing its production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The highest evaluated dose of AS-48 did not have any inhibitory effect, which could in principle seem paradoxical. However, this is a common phenomenon when dealing with natural products such as flavonoids. These show immunomodulatory properties, ameliorating inflammatory markers at low doses while showing no effect at higher ones [40].\n\n\nSkin sensitizing potential of AS-48\nExposure to a dermal sensitiser results in T-cell proliferation in local lymph nodes, which can be measured in vivo by the incorporation of bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) [41]. This assay is widely used to identify products that may cause allergic contact dermatitis. In this work, the skin sensitizing potential of AS-48 was evaluated in vivo by applying different doses of AS-48 (1, 10, and 20\u202f\u00b5g\/doses) or vehicle (20\u202f\u00b5L of DMSO) to the dorsum of both ears of CD-1 mice for 3 consecutive days, and then measuring lymphocyte proliferation in local lymph nodes by the BrdU assay and ELISA. The effect of BrdU incorporation on lymphocytes did not significantly differ in the AS-48 treated mice from that in the non-treated controls (P\u202f>\u202f0.05), while PMA-challenged mice showed a significantly stronger signal (P\u202f<\u202f0.05 vs untreated control) (Fig. 6\n).\n\n\nIn vivo AS-48 toxicity in mice: Tolerability and biochemical analysis\n\nIn vivo assays were performed to evaluate AS-48 toxicity at high concentrations (5\u202fmg\/kg) according to several serum biochemical measurements (% variation of uric acid, urea, creatine kinase-muscle\/brain, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) as indicators of metabolic disturbances or abnormalities associated with treatment. AS-48 administration caused an alteration in biochemical parameters in comparison with the negative control mice, since tolerability trials are based on aggressive treatment in terms of dose and treatment regimen (Fig. 7\n). Most of these parameters returned to normal levels (<20% variation) within 7\u202fdays.\nRemarkably, none of the treated mice died or lost more than 5% of their body mass, and all mice returned to their pre-treatment mass within 7\u202fdays. Spleens were weighed to evaluate splenomegaly as a possible response to AS-48, since this organ is involved in humoral and cellular immunity against infections. Weight percentages of spleens were determined for AS-48-treated (48\u202fh and 7\u202fdays post-treatment) and negative control mice (7\u202fdays post-treatment) (Fig. 8\n). No significant differences were observed for the different groups of mice, demonstrating that splenomegaly did not occur in the treated mice.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, a priority research area for the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO), necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial therapies: \u201cnovel drug formulations with novel antimicrobials with unique mechanisms of action and new targets\u201d. Although some promising agents are currently advancing, great difficulty is being faced in research on antibacterial drugs with regard to identifying new molecules with significant antimicrobial activity [42]. The reduced effort by pharmaceutical companies in the last 25\u202fyears to develop new antibiotics is adding to this growing crisis. However, renewed interest in discovery and development of new drugs has been observed in the last decade. Much of this effort is focused on many kinds of natural products that are being extensively studied due to their easy accessibility, few side effects, low toxicity, and better biodegradability compared to other available antimicrobial agents, justifying the entry of some of these products into clinical trials [43].\nBroad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as LAB bacteriocins, constitute a promising and exciting therapeutic option to treat MDR pathogens. Their specificity against microorganisms translates into excellent safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles in humans in most cases [21]. The mechanism of action of most bacteriocins is mainly dependent on their amphiphilic nature and capacity to insert into and selectivity disrupt bacterial cytoplasmic membranes [2]. Several bacteriocins (e.g. salivaricin, nisin A, mersacidin, lacticin 3147, and leucocin A) have been tested against multi-drug resistant bacteria and even as immune modulators in treating hospital-acquired infections of the skin and mucosal wounds, since bacterial membranes have been revealed to be an important target, even for treating persistent infections [44]. Although efficacy in (mostly) in vitro and\/or in vivo models has been tested for many bacteriocins, a thorough characterization of their fate upon administration is scarce. PK\/PD studies reported end in most cases at the level of toxicity, without a careful assessment of administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion and their impact on efficacy.\nOne feature of many AMPs that causes much controversy and complicates drug development is that their antimicrobial activity is highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Other unfavourable properties include their low metabolic stability and their haemolytic activity (which are inherent risks of therapeutic peptides in general) together with salt sensitivity and high cost of production [45]. Collectively these are key factors limiting their clinical application. Remarkably, these features are not relevant for AS-48, whose cyclic structure confers surprising molecular flexibility, stability (even in the skin, where Na+ is stored in large amounts), and resistance to exoprotease degradation, which is advantageous in therapeutic peptides. The broad antimicrobial spectrum of the bacteriocin AS-48 at low concentrations [22,25,26] promotes its application as a new drug for the treatment of infections caused by microorganisms, including antibiotic-resistant ones [4,24,26].\nOwing to its promise as an antimicrobial agent, the behaviour of AS-48 has been studied in in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate if it exhibits some degree of selective toxicity (haemolytic activity, stability and antibacterial activity in blood, or toxicity against normal human cell lines, zebrafish embryos, and a murine model). The in vitro cytotoxicity assays are indicative of the intrinsic ability of a compound to cause cell death, defining concentration ranges for safe and rational administration. Overall, these results prove that AS-48 is safe against fresh human blood at concentrations >10-fold higher than those needed to inhibit the least sensitive species tested in this work (1.4\u202f\u03bcM to eradicate E. faecalis and S. agalactiae). Thus, at 20\u202f\u03bcM, red blood cell lysis was less than 1.2%, although with defibrinated erythrocytes, haemolytic activity increased (22.6% at the same concentration). Nevertheless, this lytic effect is lower than that shown by the enterocin S37 (74.2% using 10\u202f\u03bcg\/mL) [46], the lantibiotic nisin (6% using 3.35\u202f\u03bcg\/mL) (1\u202f\u03bcM) [47] or P34 and P40 peptides from Bacillus (5.84 and 19.3% using 2.5\u202f\u03bcg\/mL, respectively) (corresponding to 1.7 and 3.12\u202f\u03bcM) [17,48]. Bovicin HC5 represents an exception to this pattern (<4% at 200\u202f\u03bcM) [49]. These in vitro experiments demonstrated that AS-48 exhibits a broad bactericidal activity in blood with no significant haemolytic effect against human erythrocytes, suggesting high selectivity for bacteria versus human cells. It is known that the antimicrobial activity of cationic peptides can be attenuated by proteolytic enzymes and divalent cations (which can hinder the bioavailability of the bacteriocin by competing for anionic sites of interaction on membranes [50]. In addition, the presence of albumin, which has a high binding capacity for hydrophobic compounds, constitutes another check on bacteriocin efficacy in the bloodstream. For these reasons, one of the major challenges in developing AS-48 for use as a drug is to verify its stability and activity in whole blood. This peptide was investigated in assays that simulated conditions of high titre bacteraemia with different bacterial species. According to our results, AS-48 was stable in blood for the duration of the time assayed (24\u202fh) and retained its antimicrobial activity. This behaviour is entirely different from that shown by the lantibiotic group of bacteriocins, which have reduced efficacy due to their propensity to bind blood components [50].\nOur results indicate a lack of AS-48 cytotoxicity toward the primary epithelial human cell line MCF10A and the fibroblast line CCD18Co (currently widely used as controls for drug toxicity), confirming its inability to cause cell death or loss of viability in these human primary cell lines (>90% cell viability) at the highest AS-48 concentration tested (27\u202f\u03bcM). This result indicates that AS-48 is considered non-cytotoxic according to standard international protocols (UNE-EN ISO 10993-5:2009). Thus, these data confirm that AS-48 is not toxic towards the non-tumour cell lines tested, in agreement with results described elsewhere, in which AS-48 was applied to normal human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells [50], murine macrophage lines MHS and J774 [25], and the R1 cell line (ACC 56) derived from Chinook salmon liver [51]. Although some other peptides have shown a cell-line-specific cytotoxic effect, under the experimental conditions used here, AS-48 did not affect the normal cell lines tested at the concentrations assayed, even at 27\u202f\u03bcM, a concentration much higher than its MICs towards bacteria. The MIC values of AS-48 were around 0.3\u202f\u03bcM for P. acnes, one of the most susceptible bacteria [26], between 0.16 and 0.73\u202f\u03bcM for Staphylococcus species [24] and between 4.47 and 8.90\u202f\u00b5M for M. tuberculosis complex clinical and reference strains (the most resistant Gram-positive bacteria described) [25]. Moreover, potent synergies with lysozyme against P. acnes, with nisin against Staphylococcus, or with ethambutol against mycobacteria, have been measured, suggesting that further reductions in dosage are feasible. The resistance to AS-48 observed in eukaryotic cells was not unexpected, since eukaryotic membranes lack negatively charged lipids and contain cholesterol. Other studies have described the binding of positively charged bacteriocins by negatively charged glycosaminoglycan sulphate residues present in the proteoglycans of the eukaryotic glycocalyx, which protects eukaryotic cells against membrane damage [52]. However, in some eukaryotic organisms, such as parasites with negatively charged membranes (i.e. trypanosomatids), AS-48 is very effective (even more than against some bacteria) [53\u201355].\nLikewise, in our in vitro inflammation disorders model, AS-48 did not significantly alter viability or induce nitrite accumulation in non-stimulated RAW macrophages, demonstrating an absence of pro-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, AS-48 decreased nitric oxide (NOx) production induced by LPS (up to 13.5\u202f\u00b5M) (>96.51\u202f\u00b5g\/mL), which suggests an immunomodulatory function of AS-48. The observed AS-48 toxicity in in vivo assays performed using zebrafish embryos could be due to the widespread high rate of proliferation that occurs during organogenesis (which starts 1\u202fday post-fertilization) and makes these embryos prone to structural malformations [37]. It is striking that even though assays using zebrafish embryos for toxicological purposes have been used for several years, there is a systematic lack of information on bacteriocins in such models (even for nisin). Furthermore, there are few references in the literature using this model with peptides. RhoB-crotamine, a defensin-like cationic peptide that displays cell-penetrating, antitumor, antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiparasitic properties at low micromolar range, was lethal to zebrafish embryos at all concentrations assayed (0.25\u20131.0\u202f\u03bcM) [38]. In a recent safety study of the cyclic lipopeptide bacillomycin DC, the LC50 value after 96\u202fh of exposure was 22.2\u202f\u03bcg\/mL [56]. In this case, the estimated lethal dose 50 (LD50) value was between 3 and 6\u202f\u00b5M, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 1.39\u202f\u00b5M. Many factors may contribute to this behaviour, especially since other non-toxic proteins, such as bovine serum albumin, widely used as a carrier for in vitro experiments on cultured mammalian cells, strongly affects zebrafish embryos, even at the lowest concentrations tested (0.5%), resulting in a strong developmental delay [57]. Furthermore, the greater sensitivity of zebrafish embryos to AS-48 may be explained by the critical development stage of the embryos and the generally higher toxicity of cationic compounds during this proliferative phase compared with neutral compounds [37,38]. This may be especially true of immature cells, which are generally more sensitive to teratogenic effects than fully differentiated cells [37]. These results, together with the absence of data on the toxicity of cationic antimicrobial peptides in zebrafish eggs suggests that this model may not be the most appropriate to test this type of compound.\nSince topical delivery may be one of the most plausible routes of administration of AS-48, to circumvent potential adverse systemic effects [1,58], its pro-inflammatory effects and ability to induce in vivo lymphocyte proliferation in mice, upon skin sensitization was assessed. The absence of lymphocyte proliferation in local lymph nodes after topical exposure to different concentrations of AS-48 indicates that this peptide does not induce skin sensitization or cause allergic contact dermatitis.\nFinally, our in vivo test in mice to evaluate the impact of a cumulative AS-48 dose of 5\u202fmg\/kg (100\u202f\u03bcg\/mouse) intraperitoneally administered in 6 doses (one every 8\u202fh), revealed that AS-48 does not produce toxic effects that cause weight loss or splenomegaly. Similar results have been obtained with rainbow trout after exposure to 13.98\u202f\u00b5M of AS-48 for 96\u202fh. Even in the treated fish, visible signs of abnormality\/toxicity were not observed [51].\n\n\nConclusions\nThe positive results presented in this work highlight the potential of AS-48 as a feasible candidate for further pharmacological development (after carrying out the required clinical trials), to prevent and treat infections, even with multi-drug resistant microorganisms, particularly in skin and soft tissues [4]. Indeed, bacteriocins produced by LAB probiotic strains have been marketed for skin care, as topical formulations to prevent and treat skin diseases, including anti-ageing benefits [44]. Global interest in bacteriocins as natural inhibitory agents to fight diverse infections is changing perspectives within the pharmaceutical industry [1,44]. The susceptibilities of several highly sensitive clinical isolates of S. aureus\n[24] and P. acnes\n[26] to AS-48 have been successfully evaluated, and the application of AS-48 as a topical antibacterial agent for these types of skin infections has been patented [59]. The effect of AS-48 either alone or synergistically combined with other antimicrobial compounds such as lysozyme, nisin or ethambutol, could further reinforce its utility in diverse scenarios. AS-48 is also a potential new leishmanicidal agent, and its use has been suggested for the treatment of ulcers in non-disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis [54]. Additional pharmacokinetic and in vivo efficacy studies will prove the real applicability of AS-48 to treat infections.\nThe results presented here represent pioneering work in the field of bacteriocin toxicity in in vivo models, as, despite extensive use of bacteriocins in food and abundant literature suggesting their potential in medicine, there is limited research addressing this point.\n\n\nFunding\nThis research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (SAF2013-48971-C2-1-R, CSD2010-00065, and AGL2015-67995-C3-3-R, all including funds from the European Regional Development Funding, ERDF) and by the Research Groups (BIO160, CTS 944 and CTS 164, UGR) from Junta de Andaluc\u00eda (Spain).

Historically, Millettia is a traditional medicine used in the treatment of gynecological diseases, dysentery, cardiovascular diseases, intestinal pain, rheumatic arthritis, and skin diseases [2,3]. Previous phytochemical investigations of this genus have demonstrated the presence of steroids, alkaloids, triterpenoids, and flavonoids [4\u20137].\n\nMillettia pachyloba Drake (M. pachyloba) belongs to the Leguminosae family and is a type of semi-evergreen perennial woody vine plant primarily distributed in the Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, and Yunnan Provinces of China. The stems of M. pachyloba are often used by locals as a herbal medicine for the treatment of tumors, rheumatic arthritis and removing edema from patients. To date, only three studies have focused on the phytochemical study of M. pachyloba\n[8\u201310], which is far from providing a deep understanding of M. pachyloba. Thus, further intensive phytochemical study of M. pachyloba is needed.\nAutophagy is the primary cellular process for protecting cells and organisms from natural stressors such as ER-stress as well as nutrient deficiency. In addition to its function in normal physiology, autophagy also plays a role in cancer [11]. Recently, it was established as a tumor suppression mechanism; loss of autophagy function was required for the initiation of cancer [12]. Because previous research reported that isolated flavonoids from M. pachyloba exhibited initial cytotoxicity against KB cells [8], it was worthwhile screening the autophagy inducer in M. pachyloba and further testing the underlying mechanism. Durmillone is an isoflavone with a dimethyl pyran moiety connected to C6 and C7. It is widespread in the genus of Millettia\n[13,14] and Lonchocarpus\n[15]\n. However, there is no research reporting its cytotoxic mechanism of action.\nThis study carried out intensive phytochemical study of M. pachyloba. In addition, the initial cytotoxic mechanism of action of the compounds separated form M. pachyloba were investigated.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nGeneral experimental procedures\nThe following equipment and methods were used in the present study: silica gel column chromatography (200\u2013300 mesh, Qingdao Makall Group Co., Qingdao, China), Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters, Milford, USA), a Sunfire C18 column (5\u202f\u03bcm, 4.6\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f150\u202fmm; Waters, Milford, USA), a semipreparative HPLC instrument (SP-HPLC, NovaSep, Miramas, France), a digital polarimeter for optical rotation measurements (Jasco P-1020, Tokyo, Japan), a UV-2100 spectrophotometer for ultraviolet absorbance detection (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), a Nicolet-6700 FT-IR spectrometer for IR spectral detection (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA), an Aviv Model 400 CD spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, USA), an Avance-400 spectrometer for NMR spectral detection (Bruker, Billerica, USA), and a Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer coupled with an ESI source (Waters, Milford, USA).\n\n\nPlant material\nResearcher Hua Peng (Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences) collected and identified the stems of M. pachyloba at Pingbian, Yunan, China, in September 2015. A voucher specimen (SKLB-201509) was deposited in the Lab of Natural Product Drugs and Cancer Biotherapy, Sichuan University.\n\n\nExtraction and isolation\nAir-dried stems of M. pachyloba (10\u202fkg) were ground into powder (approximately 20-mesh). The powder was extracted with 60 L 95% aqueous EtOH three times. The EtOH extracts were combined and evaporated to dryness in vacuo to produce 712\u202fg crude sample. It was then suspended in 5 L deionized H2O and successively exhausted with 5 L petroleum ether and 5 L CH2Cl2 to give dried petroleum ether (48\u202fg) and CH2Cl2 (77\u202fg) extracts, respectively, for further separation.\nThe petroleum ether extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether\/EtOAc from 100\/1 to 1\/1, v\/v) for rough separation, and eleven fractions (Fr. A1\u2013Fr. A11) were collected. Fr. A5 (1.3\u202fg) was subjected to SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 75\/25, v\/v) to yield 7.8\u202fmg of compound 18. Fr.

A9 (2.8\u202fg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether\/EtOAc, from 20\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) and further purified by SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 80\/20 and 85\/15, v\/v, respectively) to yield 8.7\u202fmg compound 3 and 19.6\u202fmg compound 5.\nThe CH2Cl2 extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether\/EtOAc, from 50\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v), and 15 fractions (Fr. B1\u2013Fr. B15) were produced. Fr. B3 (1.3\u202fg) was subjected to SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 85\/15, v\/v) to yield 5.9\u202fmg compound 19. Fr. B5 (4.6\u202fg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using petroleum ether\/EtOAc (from 20\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v), and six subfractions were obtained (Fr. B5.1\u2013Fr. B5.6). Fr. B5.3 and Fr. B5.5 were subjected to SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 85\/15, and 70\/30, respectively) to produce 12.5\u202fmg compound 2 and 16.3\u202fmg compound 25. Fr. B6 (1.7\u202fg) was purified using SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 65\/35, v\/v) to obtain 61.4\u202fmg compound 20. Fr. B7 (4.8\u202fg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether\/EtOAc from 20\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) and further purified using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (CH2Cl2\/MeOH, from 10\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) to produce 9.3\u202fmg compound 8, 23.1\u202fmg compound 13 and 17.2\u202fmg compound 21.

B10 (4.1\u202fg) was separated on a silica gel column (petroleum ether\/EtOAc, from 20\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) and by SP-HPLC (MeOH\/H2O, 75\/25, and 65\/35, respectively) to yield 47.8\u202fmg compound 12 and 13.7\u202fmg compound 15. Fr. B11 (4.5\u202fg) was purified in the same manner as Fr. B10 to produce 10.2\u202fmg compound 14, 36.3\u202fmg compound 24 and 38.1\u202fmg compound 27. Fr. B12 (2.3\u202fg) underwent Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (CH2Cl2\/MeOH, from 10\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) to yield 18.5\u202fmg compound 16 and 16.1\u202fmg compound 17. Fr. B13 (3.7\u202fg) underwent Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography (H2O\/MeOH, from 10\/1 to 1\/5, v\/v) to yield 48.3\u202fmg compound 26 and 53.9\u202fmg compound 28.

HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, Hct116, MDA-MB-231, and HUVECs were obtained from KeyGEN Biotech Co. (Nanjing, China) and cultured with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere, and the concentration of CO2 was set at 5%.\n\n\nCytotoxicity assay\nThe cytotoxic effects of the isolated compounds were investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates with 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f104\u202fcells per well. Cells were cultured for 24\u202fh before treatment with different compounds at various concentrations (0\u201340\u202f\u03bcM) for 72\u202fh. Then, 20\u202f\u03bcL MTT solution (5\u202fmg\/mL) was added to each well and incubated for another 4\u202fh. The supernatants were discarded, and 150\u202f\u03bcL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and incubated for 10\u202fmin. The absorbance at 570\u202fnm was detected using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA). The cytotoxicity (IC50, half maximal inhibitory concentration) of each compound was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.\n\n\nAutophagy detection using GFP-LC3 expression in HeLa cells\nThe effects of compound-induced autophagy were determined in GFP-LC3-HeLa cells [16,17]. The GFP-LC3-HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates and incubated with the tested compounds at various concentrations. Chloroquine phosphate treatment-induced LC3 dots were used as an observation control. Plates were incubated for 24\u202fh, and the GFP-LC3 puncta were detected and imaged under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with Olympus Stream software.\n\n\nDetection of apoptotic cells using flow cytometry\nHeLa and MCF-7 cells seeded on six-well plates for 24\u202fh were incubated with 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20\u202f\u03bcM compound 9 or colchicine (positive control) for 48\u202fh. Cells were collected, digested with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-free trypsin for 3\u202fmin and centrifuged (170\u202f\u00d7\u202fg, 3\u202fmin) before being washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer twice and centrifuged (170\u202f\u00d7\u202fg, 3\u202fmin). Then, the cells were resuspended and stained with reagents from the Annexin V\/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Detection Kit (Invitrogen) for approximately 30\u202fmin according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The stained cells were subjected to flow cytometry (Attune NxT, Life Technology, Waltham, USA) for analysis. Data and image analyses were conducted using FlowJo 7.6 software. The PI\u2212\/Annexin V\u2212, PI+\/Annexin V\u2212, PI\u2212\/Annexin V+, and PI+\/Annexin V+ cells were considered viable cells, necrotic cells, early apoptotic cells, and late apoptotic cells, respectively. In this study, the early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells were combined and counted as the total number of apoptotic cells.\n\n\nWestern blotting analysis\nHeLa cells were collected and washed twice with PBS before being lysed with protein lysis radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for 30\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at 18894g for 30\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Proteins were denatured in 1\u202f\u00d7\u202floading buffer in boiling water for 10\u202fmin. Equal amounts (20\u202f\u03bcg) of samples were loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the ionophoretic separation of proteins for 1\u202fh using a constant voltage of 120\u202fV. Proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using 260\u202fmA constant current for 2\u202fh. Transferred PVDF membranes were blocked with a 5% milk solution (in 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fPBST buffer (0.1% Tween\u00ae 20 in PBS buffer)) for 1\u202fh at room temperature before incubation with primary antibodies at 4\u202f\u00b0C overnight. PVDF membranes were washed three times (10\u202fmin each) with 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fPBST buffer. Secondary antibodies were incubated with PVDF membranes for 45\u202fmin at room temperature, and the membranes were washed three times (10\u202fmin each) with 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fPBST. The membranes were stained with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Millipore, Burlington, USA) and imaged using a chemiluminescence image analysis system (Tianneng, Shanghai, China) with Tanon-5200 Multi software (Tianneng, Shanghai, China).\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nIsolation of compounds 1\u201328.\nApproximately 10\u202fkg dry stems of M. pachyloba were shattered into powder (approximately 20-mesh) and extracted with 95% aqueous EtOH three times. The EtOH extracts were combined, evaporated to dryness, suspended in H2O and successively extracted with petroleum ether and CH2Cl2. The petroleum ether and CH2Cl2 extracts were further separated using column chromatography (silica gel and Sephadex LH-20) as well as reverse-phase SP-HPLC to obtain compounds 1\u201328 (see Fig. 1\n).\n\n\nChemical structure identification of the isolated compounds.\nCompound 1 was obtained as a white powder and assigned a molecular formula of C23H24O5 by HRESIMS at m\/z 381.1707 ([M+H]+, calcd for 381.1702), indicating twelve double bond equivalents. The UV spectrum absorption at 256 and 326.4\u202fnm, 1H (\u03b4\nH 8.02 for H-2) and 13C (\u03b4\nC 152.3 for C-2) NMR spectra and 1H detected heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) correlations (Fig. 2\n) of H-2 (\u03b4\nH 8.02) to C-3 (\u03b4\nC 123.9), C-8a (\u03b4\nC 150.0) and C-4 (\u03b4\nC 176.1) showed this compound to be an isoflavone-type skeleton [18,19]. Analysis of the 1H NMR (Table 1) and homonuclear chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (COSY) correlations revealed a \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nH 3.59 (2H, d, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 5.21 (1H, t, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 1.84 (3H, s), 1.69 (3H, s)], a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring [\u03b4\nH 7.52 (2H, d, J\u202f=\u202f8.8\u202fHz), 6.98 (2H, d, J\u202f=\u202f8.8\u202fHz)], three methoxy groups [\u03b4\nH 3.96 (3H, s), 3.93 (3H, s), 3.84 (3H, s)], an aromatic proton [\u03b4\nH 7.60 (1H, s)] and a vinyl proton [\u03b4\nH 8.02 (1H, s)]. The 13C NMR spectra of 1 indicated 23 signals, including three methoxy groups [\u03b4\nC 55.3, 56.0 and 61.1] and one \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nC 17.9, 22.9, 25.8, 121.5 and 132.7]. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 and millesianin H [2] revealed similar carbon and proton resonances, except that 1 contained one more methoxy group. A further HMBC correlation study (Fig. 2) showed that this methoxy group (\u03b4\nH 3.93) was attached to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 151.9). Therefore, the chemical structure of compound 1 was identified as 8-(\u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl)-6,7,4\u2032-trimethoxyisoflavone, and it was named pachyvone A.\nCompound 2 was isolated as a white powder. Its formula of C23H22O6 was deduced by HRESIMS at m\/z 395.1506 ([M+H]+, calcd for 395.1495). In the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 2, an olefinic proton at \u03b4\nH 8.01 (s, H-2), an oxygenated carbon resonance at \u03b4\nC 152.5 (C-2) and a carbonyl carbon resonance at \u03b4\nH 175.9 (C-4) suggested an isoflavone skeleton [18,19]. The 1H NMR spectrum showed (Table 1) the presence of a \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nH 3.59 (2H, d, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 5.21 (1H, t, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 1.84 (3H, s), 1.69 (3H, s)], an ABX-type benzene ring [\u03b4\nH 6.87 (1H, d, J\u202f=\u202f8.0\u202fHz), 7.00 (1H, dd, J\u202f=\u202f8.0\u202fHz, J\u202f=\u202f1.6\u202fHz), 7.12 (1H, d, J\u202f=\u202f1.6\u202fHz)], two methoxy groups [\u03b4\nH 3.96 (3H, s), 3.93 (3H, s)], a methylenedioxy group [\u03b4\nH 5.99 (2H, s)], an aromatic proton [\u03b4\nH 7.59 (1H, s)] and a vinyl proton [\u03b4\nH 8.01 (1H, s)]. The 13C NMR spectra of 2 indicated 23 signals, including two methoxy groups [\u03b4\nC 56.1 and 61.1], one \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nC 17.9, 22.9, 25.8, 121.5, and 132.7] and a methylenedioxy functionality [\u03b4\nC 101.1]. These signals were similar to the resonances of predurmillone [20], except that the hydroxyl group in predurmillone was replaced by a methoxyl group (\u03b4\nH 3.93) in 2. These results were further directly supported by the HMBC correlation (Fig. 2) from the proton signal at \u03b4\nH 3.93 to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 151.96) and indirectly demonstrated by the HMBC correlations (Fig. 2) from the proton signals at \u03b4\nH 7.59 (s) to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 151.96) and C-4 (\u03b4\nC 175.9) because this proton was not substituted and the methoxyl group (\u03b4\nH 3.93) should be attached to C-7. Therefore, the structure of compound 2 was identified as 8-(\u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-4\u2032,5\u2032-methylenedioxyisoflavone, and it was named pachyvone B.\nCompound 4 was isolated as a white powder and assigned the molecular formula C25H28O7, as indicated by the HRESIMS at m\/z 441.1914 ([M+H]+, calcd for 441.1913), which suggested twelve double bond equivalents. A singlet at \u03b4\nH 8.05 (H-2) in the 1H NMR spectrum and the 13C NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 154.5 (C-2), 120.9 (C-3), and 176.0 (C-4) were consistent with an isoflavone core structure that was further corroborated by its UV spectrum (\u03bbmax at 255.4 and 297.9\u202fnm) [18,19]. Compound 4 and millesianin I [2] had similar 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) because both compounds contained a \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit, a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring, four methoxy groups, an aromatic proton and a vinyl proton, except that compound 4 contained one additional methoxy group signal at \u03b4\nC 61.11 and \u03b4\nH 3.93. HMBC correlation (Fig. 2) of the proton resonance at \u03b4\nH 3.93 with C-7 (\u03b4\nC 151.81) demonstrated that the additional methoxy group was attached to C-7. Accordingly, the structure of compound 4 was established as 8-(\u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl)-6,7,2\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-pentamethoxyisoflavone, and it was named pachyvone C.\nCompound 5 was isolated as a yellowish powder. Its molecular formula was determined to be C24H26O8 by HRESIMS at m\/z 443.1705 ([M+H]+, calcd for 443.1706), suggesting twelve double bond equivalents. The UV maxima at \u03bbmax 266.0 and 300.0\u202fnm as well as the specific proton signal at \u03b4\nH 7.97 (1H, s, H-2) that was correlated with \u03b4\nC 155.4 (C-2), as shown by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum, suggested that compound 5 possessed an isoflavone-type skeleton [18,19]. The 1H NMR (Table 1) and COSY correlations of compound 5 revealed signals for a \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nH 3.46 (2H, d, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 5.18 (1H, t, J\u202f=\u202f7.2\u202fHz), 1.81 (3H, s), 1.70 (3H, s)], a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring [\u03b4\nH 6.67 (1H, s), 6.87 (1H, s)], four methoxy groups [\u03b4\nH 4.01 (3H, s), 3.93 (3H, s), 3.86 (3H, s), 3.74 (3H, s)] and a hydroxyl group [\u03b4\nH 12.88 (1H, s)]. The 13C NMR spectrum of 5 indicated 23 signals, including four methoxy groups [\u03b4\nC 56.5, 56.7, 60.7 and 61.4] and one \u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl unit [\u03b4\nC 17.8, 22.2, 25.8, 122.2 and 132.1]. Compound 5 exhibited NMR data very similar to those of compound 4. However, 5 had a chelated hydroxyl group at \u03b4\nH 12.88 (1H, s, OH-5), which is absent in 4. Moreover, there is one more methoxyl group in 5 compared to 4. The HMBC correlations of the hydroxyl group (\u03b4\nH 12.88) with C-4a (\u03b4\nC 108.60), C-5 (\u03b4\nC 152.47) and C-6 (\u03b4\nC 136.64) suggested a hydroxy group at the C-5 position. HMBC correlations from the proton signals of four methoxy groups [\u03b4\nH 4.01 (3H, s), 3.93 (3H, s), 3.86 (3H, s), 3.74 (3H, s)] demonstrated that these four methoxy groups were attached to C-7, C-6, C-5\u2032, and C-2\u2032, respectively. The chemical shift of C-4\u2032 (\u03b4\nC 146.89) combined with the molecular formula C24H26O8 showed that compound 5 had a hydroxy group at the C-4\u2032 position. The key HMBC correlations are shown in Fig. 2. On the basis of the evidence obtained, the structure of compound 5 was determined to be 8-(\u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl)-5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-6,7,2\u2032,5\u2032-tetramethoxyisoflavone, and it was named pachyvone D.\nCompound 6 was obtained as a yellowish powder with the molecular formula C23H24O7 deduced by HRESIMS at m\/z 413.1605 (([M+H]+, calcd for 413.1600)). The UV maxima at \u03bbmax 263.7 and 294.4\u202fnm along with the IR absorptions (\u03bdmax) at 1663 and 1466\u202fcm\u22121 showed this compound to be an isoflavonoid, as supported by the characteristic 1H and 13C NMR resonances at \u03b4\nH-2 7.94 and \u03b4\nC-2 155.2 for this type of natural product [18,19]. The NMR data (Table 1) were very similar to those of compound 5, except for the loss of one methoxy group signal and the appearance of one additional aromatic proton signal at \u03b4\nC 95.12 and \u03b4\nH 6.41, which indicates that one methoxy group of compound 5 may be replaced by an aromatic proton to obtain compound 6. The HMBC correlations (Fig. 2) from the aromatic proton signal at \u03b4\nH 6.41 to C-4a (\u03b4\nC 105.83), C-5 (\u03b4\nC 160.93), C-7 (\u03b4\nC 162.72) and C-8 (\u03b4\nC 107.82) suggested that the aromatic proton was attached to C-6. Therefore, compound 6 was determined to be 8-(\u03b3, \u03b3-dimethylallyl)-5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-7,2\u2032,5\u2032-trimethoxyisoflavone, and it was named pachyvone E.\nThe physical nature of isoflavones has a close relationship with their structure. In these newly isolated isoflavones, compounds 1, 2, and 4 were reported as white powders, while compounds 5 and 6 were reported as yellow powders. Careful investigation of the differences in structures revealed that the presence of a 4-OH group in the yellow-colored compounds (5 and 6) could verify the extended conjugation system, while this 4-OH moiety is absent or replaced in the white-colored compounds.\nCompound 7 was obtained as a yellow powder, and its molecular formula was assigned as C20H18O7 from the positive ion peak at m\/z 371.1137 ([M+H]+, calcd for 371.1131) in the HRESIMS, which corresponded to twelve double bond equivalents. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 2) showed similar signals to nigrolineaxanthone F [21]: two aromatic protons [\u03b4\nH 6.40 (1H, s) and 7.47 (1H, s)] and dimethylchromene protons [\u03b4\nH 5.60 (1H, d, J\u202f=\u202f10.0\u202fHz), 6.73 (1H, d, J\u202f=\u202f10.0\u202fHz) and 1.48 (6H, s)]. These protons were located at the same positions as nigrolineaxanthone F according to their HMBC correlations. The major difference between compound 7 and nigrolineaxanthone F was that compound 7 exhibited two more methoxy group signals at \u03b4\nH 4.05 and 4.16 and nigrolineaxanthone F had two more vinyl signals at \u03b4\nH 7.39 (1H, d, J\u202f=\u202f8.5\u202fHz) and 7.28 (1H, dd, J\u202f=\u202f8.5\u202fHz, J\u202f=\u202f3.0\u202fHz), which suggests that the vinyl protons were substituted by these two methoxy groups. This result was corroborated by the HMBC correlations (Fig. 2) from the proton resonance at \u03b4\nH 7.47 (H-8) to C-6 (\u03b4\nC 145.6). Therefore, the structure of compound 7 was determined to be 1,7-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-6\u2032,6\u2032-dimethylpyrano (2\u2032,3\u2032:3,4) xanthone, and it was named pachythone A.\nBased on the spectroscopic data and comparisons with the data found in the literature, the known compounds were identified as 8-prenylmilldurone (3) [22], 6-methoxycalpogonium isoflavone A (8) [23], durmillone (9) [24], durallone (10) [25], ichthynone (11) [8], millesianin C (12) [26], toxicarol isoflavone (13) [27], cladrastin (14) [28], dalpatein (15) [29], 7-hydroxy-2\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032,6-tetramethoxyisoflavone (16) [30], 3,9-dihydroxypterocarp-6a-en (17) [31], dehydromaackiain (18) [32], flemichapparin B (19) [33], (\u2212)-medicarpin (20) [34], (\u2212)-maackiain (21) [35], (\u2212)-variabilin (22) [36], (\u2212)-pisatin (23) [37], dalbinol (32) [38], (\u2212)-sativin (25) [39], (\u2212)-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (26) [40], (+)-vomifoliol (27) [41], and dihydrophaseic acid (28) [42].\n\n\nPrimary screening for cytotoxic compounds\nFlavones have shown cytotoxic activity toward cancer cells such as HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines [43,44]. Therefore, the primary cytotoxic activities of 28 compounds were tested on HeLa and MCF-7 cells by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 3\n, ten compounds (3\u20135, 9, 12, 17\u201319, 24, and 25) showed growth inhibition of HeLa and MCF-7 cells at a 50\u202f\u03bcM concentration, while the other compounds possessed no activity. Notably, compounds 4, 9, and 12 are the most active compounds.\n\n\nCytotoxic activities of selected compounds on cancer cells and normal cells\nIsoflavones are known to be phytoestrogens, and thus, an estrogen receptor-positive cell line (MCF-7) and estrogen receptor-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) together with other cancer cell lines were used in this study. The cytotoxic activities of the ten active compounds were evaluated in five cancer cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, Hct116, and MDA-MB-231) and one normal cell line (HUVEC) using doxorubicin as a positive control. Cancer cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the compounds (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40\u202f\u03bcM), and normal cells were treated with the compounds at 50\u202f\u03bcM for 72\u202fh. Cell viability was examined by the MTT assay. The IC50 values of the ten compounds were calculated and are presented in Table 3\n. Compounds 4, 9, and 12 showed better anticancer activities than the other compounds. These compounds showed no selectivity on estrogen receptor-negative and estrogen receptor-positive cells, implying that these compounds exhibit no activity on estrogen receptors. Notably, all of these compounds had no activity against normal cells, suggesting that these compounds are safe anticancer candidate compounds.\n\n\nCompound 9 induced autophagy in HeLa and MCF-7 cells\nNumerous flavonoids mediate cell death using an autophagy-dependent pathway [45\u201347]. Here, a GFP-LC3-HeLa cell line was used to investigate whether the cytotoxicity of the ten compounds was associated with autophagy. LC3 is an autophagy marker protein that forms autophagosomes during autophagy induction [48]. Autophagosome dots, indicating aggregated LC3 protein, were directly observed in GFP-LC3-HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-labeled LC3 proteins using a fluorescence microscope. GFP-LC3-HeLa cells were treated with the ten compounds for 24\u202fh at 10\u202f\u03bcM. Chloroquine phosphate treatment-induced LC3 dots were used as the observation control. Fig. 4\n shows that chloroquine phosphate induced an obvious increase in the GFP-LC3 dots, which indicates the appearance of autophagosomes. All the tested compounds produced an increase in GFP-LC3 dots, and compound 9 (durmillone) showed the best activity. Durmillone (9) induced GFP-LC3 punctation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the ten compounds induce autophagy and that compound 9 exhibits the best activity.\nThe expression of autophagy-associated proteins, such as LC3-II, Beclin1, and Atg7 [48], was detected in HeLa and MCF-7 cells treated with compound 9 using Western blotting analysis, further verifying this result. The results indicated that compound 9 remarkably and dose-dependently upregulated the expression levels of LC3-II, Beclin1, and Atg7 in HeLa and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5\n). Taken together, these results demonstrate that compound 9 induced obvious autophagy in HeLa cells. As compound 9 exhibited the best activity in inducing autophagy, it was chosen for further study.\n\n\nCompound 9 induced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells.\nPlasma membrane surface Annexin V isa marker of apoptosis, and propidium iodide (PI) is used to detect late apoptotic cells, so the combined PI\/Annexin V double staining method is a classic method of apoptosis detection. In the present study, the PI\/Annexin V double staining flow cytometric assay was used to further investigate compound 9 induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Colchicine, a tubulin inhibitor, was employed as a positive control. The results revealed that compound 9 induced apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The apoptosis rates were 5.04%, 45.62%, 17.96%, 36.30%, 43.84%, and 44.14% for HeLa cells treated with the negative control (DMSO), positive control (colchicine), and 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u202f\u03bcM compound 9, respectively. Additionally, the apoptosis rates in MCF-7 cells were 8.55%, 38.01%, 15.89%, 31.33%, 38.77%, and 39.27% for the negative control (DMSO), positive control (colchicine), and 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u202f\u03bcM compound 9, respectively (Fig. 6\n). To further verify the induction of apoptotic events by compound 9 in cancer cells, the level of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, which is a marker of late apoptotic events, was determined using Western blotting in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Cells treated with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u202f\u03bcM compound 9 for 48\u202fh induced obvious PARP cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7\n), which further demonstrates that compound 9 also induces apoptosis in cancer cells.\nIn summary, the results of the present study suggest that compound 9 mediates cytotoxic activity through the combined action of apoptosis and autophagy.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, systematic separation and subsequent pharmacological activity studies were carried out to obtain cytotoxic natural products from the dried stems of M. pachyloba. Ten cytotoxic natural products (3\u20135, 9, 12, 17\u201319, 24, and 25) from the dried stems of Millettia pachyloba Drake were obtained, and compound 9 exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity through the combined action of apoptosis and autophagy.\nPhytochemical investigation of the stems of Millettia pachyloba led to the isolation of five previously undescribed isoflavones (1, 2, and 4\u20136), one previously undescribed xanthone (7), and twenty-two known compounds. These findings enrich the diversity of chemical components of the genus Millettia. Biological assays to examine the cytotoxic effects of ten compounds (3\u20135, 9, 12, 17\u201319, 24, and 25) showed that these compounds produced cytotoxic effects in HepG2, MCF-7, and HeLa cell, with IC50 values ranging from 5 to 40\u202f\u03bcM. Notably, durmillone (9) induced cytotoxicity through the combined action of apoptosis and autophagy in HeLa cells, which suggests that flavonoids are responsible for the cytotoxicity of M. pachyloba.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1541":"\n\nIntroduction\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts. Based on statistical data, AML represents approximately 1.1% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. and is more common in older adults and males. The death rate is higher among patients over 65\u202fyears and unfortunately, the rate has failed to decrease in recent years [1]. Chromosomal structural variations and genetic abnormalities play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AML [2]. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas project, the five most common mutated genes in AML comprise NPM1, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, and FLT3 [3]. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1\/2 (IDH1\/2) mutations occur in approximately 15% of AML patients, and the frequency increases with age [4]. Mutations in IDH1\/2 are associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells [5]. The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene encodes a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates hematopoiesis, including differentiation and proliferation of stem cells [6]. FLT3 mutations are correlated with worse clinical outcome in younger adults [7]. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of FLT3 exist in 15% of patients with AML.\nThe nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML [8]. The normal function of NPM1 is to control ribosome formation and export, stabilize the oncosuppressor p14Arf protein in the nucleolus and regulate centrosome duplication [9]. Mutations in NPM1 were found in 20\u201330% of AML patients. These alterations induce abnormal cytoplasmic localization of the protein which is a critical step in leukemogenesis [8]. NPM1 mutations are restricted to myeloid cells, and aberrant cytoplasmic dislocation was not observed in lymphoid cells, including the reactive lymph nodes or B and T cells from bone marrow biopsies or peripheral blood [10]. NPM1 mutations are frequently associated with internal tandem duplication (ITD) of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations [11,12]. In addition, besides the FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations, NPM1 mutations also co-occur with IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 mutations [13]. There are mutations that rarely occur with NPM1 mutations, such as partial tandem duplication in the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and mutations in RUNX1, CEBPA, and TP53 genes [3]. FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations are rarely accompanied by NPM1 mutations [14]. A previous study described favorable prognosis of NPM1 mutated AML patients with normal karyotype [15]. Another study demonstrated that karyotype, age, NPM1 mutation status, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and CD34 expression were independent prognostic markers for overall survival [16]. A previous study also demonstrated that IDH1 mutations are associated with favorable survival outcome in NPM1 mutant\/FLT3-ITD-negative patients [17]. Currently, chemotherapy in younger and fit patients is still the primary treatment for AML patients. Chemotherapy generally includes a combination of an anthracycline, such as daunorubicin [18] or idarubicin [19], and cytarabine [20] agents. Of note, NPM1 mutated AML is highly responsive to induction chemotherapy [21], and up to 80% of patients experience complete remission with clearance of leukemic cells 16\u202fdays after starting a treatment [22]. In the last decade, several molecularly targeted agents were proposed for the treatment of AML, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib [23], midostaurin [24], quizartinib [25], and crenolanib [26] which inhibit the tyrosine kinase domain of the FLT3 kinase. STAT3 inhibitors, including C188-9 [27] and OPB-31121 [28], specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3 protein, which is highly upregulated in up to 50% of AML patients and is associated with poor prognosis. There are several additional targeted agents, such as IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors [29,30], nuclear export inhibitors [31] and CD33 and CD123 antigen specific inhibitors [32].\nThe aim was to examine the transcriptomic fingerprint of NPM1 gene mutations to shed light on transformed molecular pathways. First, genes showing altered expression in NPM1 mutated patients were identified and correlated these findings to different survival outcomes in multiple different genome-wide training sets. The best hits were validated in an independent set of patients.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nThe analysis was based on utilizing a training and a validation set (Fig. 1\nA). Data processing was performed in the R v3.2.3 statistical environment (http:\/\/www.r-project.org).\n\nPreprocessing of the training set\nA suitable training AML dataset with available gene expression and clinical data was searched in the NCBI GEO repository (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/). The keywords \u201cAML,\u201d \u201cGPL570\u201d and \u201cGPL96\u201d were utilized, and we filtered for those datasets that included raw gene expression data and clinical information for the same patients. Array quality control was performed for all samples using the \u201cyaqcaffy\u201d (http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/yaqcaffy\/) library. The background, the raw Q, the percentage of present calls, the presence of BioB-\/C-\/D- spikes, the GAPDH 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 ratio and the beta-actin 3\u2019\u20135\u2019 ratio were assessed and used only those arrays that passed the preset quality criteria. The MAS5 algorithm by the \u201caffy\u201d (http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/affy\/) library was used to normalize the data. An additional second scaling normalization was made to set the mean expression on each array to 1000. For genes measured by various probe sets, we employed JetSet to choose the most trustworthy probe set [33].\n\n\nRNA-seq and mutation data of AML patients\nTwo additional datasets were used for training, a gene-chip dataset (processed as described above) and an RNA-seq dataset. In the RNA-seq dataset, the somatic mutation data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https:\/\/cancergenome.nih.gov\/). The preprocessed and annotated MAF (Mutation Annotation Format) data files were used generated by MuTect2, MUSE, VarScan and SomaticSniper pipelines. The \u201cmaftools\u201d package (http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/maftools\/) was applied for aggregation and visualization of mutation data.\nThe htseq counts RNA-seq data generated by the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing version 2 platform was used for gene expression estimation. The \u201cAnnotationDbi\u201d package (http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/AnnotationDbi\/) was applied to annotate Ensembl transcript IDs with gene symbols (n\u202f=\u202f25,228). The \u201cDESeq\u201d package based on the negative binomial distribution was used to normalize the raw read counts data [34].\n\n\nSemmelweis set\nClinical samples diagnosed at the 1st Department of Pathology-, and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary were utilized in the in vitro validation. All materials and protocols were approved by the Institutional Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of the Semmelweis University TUKEB \u2013 14383-2\/2017\/EKU. Mutation status was determined by Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR measurement was utilized to examine the gene expression changes.\nDNA was isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. DNA concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).\n\n\nRNA isolation\nThe peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were homogenized for 2\u202fh using hemolysis solution containing 0.15\u202fM NH4Cl, 10\u202fM NH4HCO3, and 0.1\u202fM EDTA with a pH of 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After hemolysis, samples were centrifuged at 1800\u202fRPM for 10\u202fmin and washed with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).\n\n\nSanger sequencing\nThe amplification of NPM1 was performed using AmpliTaqGold (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) polymerase mix in a PE 2720 GeneAmp (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) PCR machine. Forward (5\u2032- TTC CAT ACA TAC TTA AAA CCA A-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032- TGG TTC CTT AAC CAC ATT TCT TT \u22123\u2032) primers were employed in a 25\u202fmL final volume. The reaction mix contained 2x AmpliTaqGold mix, 400\u202fnM of each primer and 100\u202fng of DNA. Amplification started with denaturation for 10\u202fmin at 95\u202f\u00b0C, and then 95\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fsec, 56\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fsec and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fsec were repeated for 40 cycles. The PCR products were cleaned using ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California USA), and trailed using the Big Dye Terminator kit v3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) direct sequencing reaction following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For sequencing analysis an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) machine was used, and the results were visualized using SeqA6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) software.\n\n\nQuantitative PCR measurement\nFor qPCR analysis, 1\u202f\u00b5g of total RNA from each sample was transcribed in a final volume of 25\u202f\u00b5L using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) and SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Kit (Bioline Reagents, London, UK).\nPrimers were designed on exon-exon junctions and covering all transcript variants of each selected gene. GAPDH and TBP genes were used as reference genes (Table 1\n).\nThe reactions were performed in a 20\u202f\u00b5L final volume, containing 1\u202f\u00b5L of cDNA, diluted 2-fold, and 125\u202fnM of each primer. After a preliminary denaturation step of 2\u202fmin at 95\u202f\u00b0C, 40 cycles with three steps were performed: 95\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fsec, 60\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fsec and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fsec. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and the threshold cycle (Ct) was determined for each gene. The \u0394Ct method was employed to evaluate gene expression changes and we used 2(-\u0394Ct)-values of the data. WinSTAT (http:\/\/www.winstat.com) was used to analyze the data.\n\n\nStatistical computations\nFirst, patients were divided into a mutated and a wild-type cohort based on the somatic mutation status of NPM1. Normal distribution of the data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s W test. Then, Wilcoxon analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes between the mutant and wild type cohorts. In addition, median fold change (FC) was computed for each gene to determine the direction of the expression change. Significance was accepted for genes with less than 0.5 or higher than 2 and with a p value below P\u202f<\u202f0.05.\nCorrelation between gene expression and overall survival (OS) was computed using Cox proportional hazards regression and by plotting Kaplan-Meier survival plots. To calculate the prognostic effect of a gene, each percentile of gene expression were computed between the lower and upper quartiles and the best performing threshold was used as the final cutoff in the Cox regression analysis [35]. The \u201csurvival\u201d R package (http:\/\/CRAN.R-project.org\/package=survival) was applied for Cox regression analysis and \u201csurvplot\u201d R package (http:\/\/www.cbs.dtu.dk\/~eklund\/survplot\/) to generate Kaplan-Meier plots. Finally, q-value was computed (the minimum false discovery rate at which the test may be called significant) to combat multiple hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAnalysis of the first training cohort\nThe training cohort was based on 536 patients from the GSE6891 dataset [36]. The gene expression profiles of these samples were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (GPL570), and we obtained both mutation and gene expression data for 460 of the 536 patients. The median follow-up for overall survival (OS) was 18.7\u202fmonths. Fig. 1B and Table 2\n show the clinico-pathological parameters, including age, gender, and FAB subtype. NPM1 was the most frequently mutated gene as 30% of patients harbored a mutation. When correlating survival length in the training cohort and NPM1 mutation status, no significant correlation was observed (P\u202f=\u202f0.3).\nWilcoxon analysis across all genes (12,205) identified 85 genes showing significantly altered expression in NPM1 mutant patients compared to the NPM1 wild type cohort. Of these, 57 genes were upregulated and 28 genes were downregulated. The full list of significantly altered genes is displayed in Table 3\n. Cox regression analysis performed for the significant genes identified a correlation with overall survival for 47 genes at an FDR below 10% (Table 4\n).\n\n\nSelecting genes for qPCR analysis\nTwo additional datasets, the TCGA and the GSE1159, were used to filter the results to obtain the most reliable genes. The TCGA repository has 200 AML patients of which 152 patients had RNA-seq gene expression data and 149 patients had somatic mutation data (Table 2). Overall survival data were available for 175 patients, and the median follow-up time was 12\u202fmonths. There were 116 patients who had both gene expression and mutation data. Survival analysis was not performed for this dataset because less than half of the patients had simultaneous survival, mutation and gene expression data. The clinical characteristics of the TCGA dataset are found in Fig. 1C and Table 2. The GSE1159 dataset [37] includes 293 patients measured using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Arrays (GPL96). Follow-up with overall survival data was available for 260 patients. There were 247 patients with simultaneous gene expression and mutation data (Table 2).\nIn the TCGA dataset, NPM1 mutations were found in 17% of patients, of which 75% of the mutations were frame shift insertions, 20% were missense and 5% were in frame deletions (Fig. 1D). Most of the frame shift insertions were localized at the nucleolar localization signal region in the C-terminal DNA\/RNA binding domain of the NPM1 gene (Fig. 1D).\nIn the TCGA and GSE1159 datasets, 49 of the previously identified 85 genes reached statistical significance. The results of the Wilcoxon test are listed in Table 5\n, and the results of the survival analysis in Table 6\n.\nFor qPCR measurement only those genes were selected which showed a significant gene expression change and a fold change over 2.0 or below 0.5 in each training set (n\u202f=\u202f32). Correlation to survival was used as an additional filter (n\u202f=\u202f19), and the pipeline of gene selection for qPCR measurement is depicted in Fig. 2\nA.\nThe best performing genes discriminating NPM1 mutant and wild-type samples were HOXA5, HOXB5, HOXA10, PBX3, MEIS1, and ITM2A. Of these, ITM2A was the only downregulated gene (Fig. 2G). Kaplan-Meier curves show that high expression of these genes was correlated with poor survival (Fig. 2B\u2013F). In the case of ITM2A, lower expression was associated with worse outcome (Fig. 2G). Correlation between mutation status and expression and expression and survival in the TCGA and GSE1159 datasets for these genes is provided in Figs. 3\n and 4\n, respectively.\n\n\nCorrelation between NPM1 mutation and mutations in other genes\nThe prevalence of NPM1 mutation was compared to IDH1, IDH2, and FLT3 mutation status in the training and validation sets by Chi-square analysis. In the training set, the correlation to IDH1 and FLT3 was significant (chi-stat\u202f=\u202f44.7, P\u202f<\u202f0.00001 and chi-stat\u202f=\u202f9.2, P\u202f=\u202f0.0024, respectively) while the correlation to IDH2 was not significant. Similarly, in the validation set, the correlation to IDH1 and FLT3 were significant (chi-stat\u202f=\u202f5.03, P\u202f=\u202f0.024 and chi-stat\u202f=\u202f8.2, P\u202f=\u202f0.0041, respectively), and IDH2 was not significant. Important to note that only 89 patients had simultaneous mutation state for each gene in the validation set.\n\n\nValidation of target genes by qPCR in the Semmelweis set\nMutation data were available for all patients in our clinical sample cohort. In this group, the NPM1 gene was mutated in 25% of patients (Fig. 5\nA). The FLT3, IDH2, and IDH1 genes harbored a mutation in 25%, 14%, and 5% of patients, respectively. The mutation frequency was independent of the sample origin, including bone marrow and blood (data not shown).\nThe Semmelweis set contains 169 AML patients (Fig. 1A); 52.6% of the samples were obtained from bone marrow and 47.4% of the samples were collected from peripheral blood. All samples have overall survival data with a median follow-up time of 6.92\u202fmonths. Similar to the training sets, most patients have intermediate cytogenetic risk (Fig. 5A). Additional clinico-pathological characteristics of the samples are displayed in Fig. 5A\u2013D and Table 2. When analyzing the mutation status of NPM1 in the Semmelweis set, no significant correlation to overall survival was observed (P\u202f=\u202f0.4).\nThe most significant genes associated with NPM1 mutations as observed in the training sets was validated by qPCR. The expressions of HOXA5 (P\u202f=\u202f3.06E\u221212, FC\u202f=\u202f8.3), HOXA10 (P\u202f=\u202f2.44E\u221209, FC\u202f=\u202f3.3), HOXB5 (P\u202f=\u202f1.86E\u221213, FC\u202f=\u202f37), MEIS1 (P\u202f=\u202f9.82E\u221210, FC\u202f=\u202f4.4) and PBX3 (P\u202f=\u202f1.03E\u221213, FC\u202f=\u202f5.4) genes were significantly higher while the expression of the ITM2A (P\u202f=\u202f0.004, FC\u202f=\u202f0.4) gene was significantly lower in the NPM1 mutant patient cohort (Fig. 5E\u2013J). Finally, the survival analysis provided a significant association between the expression of the HOXA5, HOXA10, PBX3, and MEIS1 genes and overall survival in the validation cohort (Fig. 5E\u2013I).\n\n\nCorrelation between HOX genes and co-factors\nPearson\u2019s rank correlation was computed to examine the relation of gene expression between HOX, MEIS, and PBX genes. All the P-values were less than 2.2E\u221216. High correlation was found between HOXA5 and HOXA10, HOXA5 and MEIS1, HOXA10 and MEIS1, HOXA10 and PBX3, and MEIS1 and PBX3 genes (Fig. 6\nA). In Fig. 6B, the potential interplay between HOX genes and co-factors (PBX3 and MEIS1) in the cell is displayed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nGenes showing altered expression with NPM1 somatic mutations and altered survival were identified in AML. Interestingly, NPM1 mutation status per se was not correlated to survival neither in the training nor in the validation set. The final set of NPM1-assicated genes is established in four independent datasets (three previously published genomic sets and one clinical sample set collected at the Semmelweis University). The results demonstrate that the HOXA5, HOXB5, HOXA10, PBX3, MEIS1, and ITM2A genes show the highest expression change when comparing NPM1 mutant and wild type cohorts. Of these genes, HOXA5, HOXB5, HOXA10, PBX3, and MEIS1 were upregulated, and the ITM2A gene was downregulated in the NPM1 mutant tumors. With the exception of ITM2A, higher expression was also correlated with poor prognosis.\nHomeobox genes are members of transcription factor families that are grouped into four main clusters (HOXA-D) on four different chromosomes. HOX genes play central roles in embryonic development, differentiation, and proliferation of hematopoietic cells [38]. Expression changes of HOX genes are also highly correlated with the development of hematologic malignancies [39]. In a genome-wide analysis, several HOXA and HOXB genes with their co-factors were overexpressed in AML with normal karyotype [40]. HOX expression in AML is restricted to specific genes in the HOXA or HOXB loci, and are highly correlated with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities [41]. Overexpression of HOX genes results in the expansion of progenitor cell populations and simultaneously blockade of the differentiation of these cells [42]. Here, three homeobox (HOX) genes were found \u2013 HOXA5, HOXB5, and HOXA10 \u2013 that show significantly higher expression in NPM1 mutant tumor samples. A previous study revealed that high expression of HOXA5 is linked with worse survival in AML [38]. In pediatric AML cases, NPM1 mutations affected the expression of HOXA4, HOXA6, HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXB9 genes and the MEIS1 and PBX3 genes [43]. The mechanism of action for upregulation of HOX genes in NPM1 mutated patients remains uncertain. NPM1 might directly modify the expression of HOX genes, or NPM1 mutations might inhibit the differentiation of early hematopoietic progenitors where HOX expression is upregulated [44]. The results of present study also provide robust clinical support for recent cell-culture based observations establishing the connection between NPM1 and HOX expression in AML. In their study, Brunetti and coworkers show the key role of mutant NPM1 and its aberrant cytoplasmic localization in inducing HOX expression. Nuclear re-localization of the mutated protein (NPM1c) induced immediate downregulation of HOX genes, followed by cell differentiation [45].\nHox transcription factors frequently co-operate with PBX (pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox) and MEIS (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site homeobox) family genes [46]. These genes are encoded by homeodomain-containing transcription cofactors, which have an essential role in some HOX-dependent developmental programs [47]. HOX proteins from paralog groups 1 to 10 interact with PBX proteins, whereas interaction with MEIS proteins is limited to HOX paralogs 9 to 13 [48].\nPBX proteins were identified as fusion proteins from chromosome translocations causing pre-B cell leukemia in humans [49]. The interaction between PBX and HOX proteins is essential for HOX function [50] (see Fig. 6B). Earlier studies presented that the DNA binding affinity of HOX proteins is higher when PBX proteins are present [51]. In addition, these co-factors can mediate the DNA target selection of HOX proteins [52]. PBX proteins also bind to additional factors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to mobilize these factors to the HOX complexes [53].\nMEIS proteins are members of HMP (homothorax, meis and prep) proteins and are identified as proto-oncogenes coactivated with HOX genes in leukemia [54]. Previous studies demonstrated that HMP proteins can form complexes with PBX and HOX proteins [55] (Fig. 6B). MEIS proteins also counteract HDAC activity [56]. PBX-HOX complexes can bind HDACs and repress transcription; however, this repression can be blocked by MEIS proteins capable of initiating transcription [56].\nITM2A (integral membrane protein 2A) is a type II membrane protein that belongs to the ITM2 family [57]. ITM2A is involved in myogenic differentiation, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and autophagy [58]. A patent describing a monoclonal antibody against ITM2A for the potential treatment of AML by inducing ADCC was recently submitted [59]. Decreased ITM2A expression in AML was described previously, but its function in the progression of AML is still unclear [14].\nThese results support the idea of targeting the HOX transcription complex in the targeted therapy of NPM1 mutated AML. In some solid cancers, including lung [60], breast [61], prostate [62], melanoma [63], and AML cell lines [64], HXR9 is a potent cell penetrating peptide inhibitor targeting HOX proteins by inhibiting the interaction with PBX cofactors. Alharbi et al. evaluated the mechanism of HXR9 induced cell death and found that HXR9 promotes apoptosis and necroptosis and its cytotoxicity can be enhanced by inhibiting protein kinase C (PKC) in AML cell lines [65].\n\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, by connecting mutation status with a gene expression signature we identified HOX genes and their co-factors significantly upregulated in NPM1 mutant tumors. The expression of these genes also correlated to survival outcome. The strength of this study is the utilization of several different training sets for feature selection and validation using an independent method. Based on these results, the complex involving the HOX genes with the PBX3 and MEIS1 co-factors may serve as an advanced therapeutic target in NPM1 mutated AML patients.\n\n\nAvailability of data and material\nThe NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus datasets are available using the following links:\nGSE6891: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/query\/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6891.\nGSE1159: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/query\/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1159.\nTCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset is available using the following link: https:\/\/portal.gdc.cancer.gov\/projects\/TCGA-LAML.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n","1542":"\n\nIntroduction\nBiodegradable metals have received increasing attention as temporary bone implant materials over the past years [1]. Among these metals, iron (Fe) possesses the most attractive mechanical properties for load-bearing applications. Fe is also an important biogenic element in the human body and participates in many physiological functions, such as oxygen transport, electron transfer and catalysis [2]. Additionally, Fe has good biocompatibility with very limited or no toxicity to cells, tissues and organs, which has been demonstrated in many in-vitro and in-vivo studies [3,4]. Therefore, Fe has been considered as a promising candidate for use as biodegradable implants. However, so far, the applications of Fe-based bone implants are limited due to the very slow degradation in physiological media and poor interfacial bonding with the native bone [5].\nIt is known that an ideal bone implant should not only progressively degrade at a suitable rate (approximately 0.2\u20130.5\u202fmm\u00b7year\u22121) to match the bone healing process, but also be bioactive (capability of direct bonding to the native bone) to facilitate the bone healing process [6\u201310]. To accelerate degradation, current studies on Fe-based implants have been mainly focused on alloying, surface coating, patterning, surface treatment, new fabrication methods and texturing. Cheng et al. deposited micro-patterned gold (Au) disc arrays [11], whereas Huang and Zheng deposited platinum (Pt) disc arrays [12] on the surface of pure Fe, respectively. The results indicated accelerated biodegradation due to the galvanic corrosion between the micro-patterned discs and Fe matrix. A similar coating method was also reported in poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-coated magnesium (Mg) alloys [13]. Zhou et al. reported significantly higher degradation rate of biodegradable Fe implants after surface treatment with sandblasting, which was attributed to the special properties of sandblasted surfaces, including surface composition, high roughness and high density of dislocations [14]. Bagherifard et al. treated the surface of a Mg alloy by severe shot peening and revealed that a slight grinding after shot peening led to an the improvement in electrochemical corrosion characteristics [15]. In addition, magnetron sputtering in combination with ultra violet ray lithography was also tried in fabricating Fe foils for use as biodegradable implants [16]. The Fe foils exhibited a preferential orientation in the \u30081\u202f1\u202f0\u3009 direction and -fine grain structure, as well as corrosion rates of approximately 0.1\u202fmm\u00b7year\u22121. An electroforming technique was developed for fabricating biodegradable Fe foils [17], and the results showed that the electroformed Fe possessed a fine-grain microstructure and faster degradation than those of Fe fabricated by casting and thermomechanical treatment. The effects of the rolling mode on the micro-texture evolution and biodegradation behavior of polycrystalline Fe as a biodegradable implant material were investigated by Obayi et al. [18]. The results indicated that cross-rolled samples recrystallized with lower rates than the straight-rolled ones, and no relevant differences in the corrosion rate were observed between them, except for a more uniform degradation for cross-rolled samples.\nAs for alloying, the selection of alloying elements basically considers two criteria [9,19]: (I) less noble alloying elements to increase the corrosion susceptibility of the Fe matrix, and (II) nobler alloying elements and\/or formation of intermetallic phases (IMPs) to induce galvanic corrosion with the Fe matrix. So far, manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), tin (Sn), and carbon (C), etc., have been alloyed into Fe and enhanced both the degradation rate and mechanical properties of the matrix [20\u201323].\nAs a noble metal, palladium (Pd) has a higher standard potential than Fe and is likely to form IMPs containing high amounts (at least 50 at.%) of Pd2+ due to the limited solubility in Fe. More importantly, the standard reaction potential of Pd2+\u202f+\u202f2e\u2212\u2192 Pd (E\u202f=\u202f0.915\u202fV [24]) is higher than that of most alloying elements. These two characteristics make the resulting Pd-rich IMPs much nobler than other IMPs, when compared with the Fe matrix. Thus, the introduction of Pd is expected to induce tremendous micro-galvanic corrosion, thereby increasing the degradation rate of Fe. In addition, Pd has been commonly used in orthodontic and antineoplastic applications and is considered to be tolerable by the body [25\u201327]. Nevertheless, Pd may induce cytotoxicity at high concentrations and biocompatibility is still a crucial concern for bone repairs.\nTo improve both the biocompatibility and bioactivity of Fe-Pd alloy, metal matrix composites (MMCs) with bioceramics may be a feasible approach because the performance of MMCs can be modified by varying the composition and distribution of the ceramic phase [28]. Compared with the commonly used calcium (Ca)-phosphorus (P) bioceramics, bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) has been recently evaluated as a promising bioceramic with a combination of outstanding bioactivity, excellent biocompatibility, and high mechanical strength [29]. Bredigite can rapidly induce apatite mineralization and form a strong chemical bonding with bone tissues. Moreover, the main components of bredigite, i.e., Ca, Mg and Si, can also facilitate the growth of cells and bone tissues [30]. These discoveries have stimulated the exploration of Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites with accelerated biodegradation, excellent bioactivity and favorable biocompatibility.\nSo far, Fe-based biocomposites have been fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS), powder metallurgy, pulsed electric current assisted sintering, etc. For example, Zheng et al. fabricated Fe-Pd and Fe-Pt biocomposites by SPS with powders, which showed a much smaller grain size of SPS composites than that of as-cast Fe [27]. Sikora-Jasinska et al. fabricated Fe\/Mg silicide biocomposites using different powder metallurgy techniques and found that the preparation method of the composite powder played a major role in the corrosion process and mechanism of the final biocomposites [31]. Montufar et al. developed alpha tricalcium phosphate (\u03b1-TCP)\/Fe biocomposites consolidated by pulsed electric current-assisted sintering to minimize the processing time and temperature while improving their performance [32]. As one of the additive manufacturing techniques, selective laser melting (SLM) is capable of manufacturing parts directly from three-dimensional (3D) models without the need of supporting structures or molds [33,34]. This technique enables the rapid manufacturing of custom-designed implants with complex shapes and internal structures, particularly suitable for biomedical applications [35]. Moreover, SLM can easily obtain a fine microstructure of alloys via rapid melting\/solidification [36,37]. The out-of-equilibrium process is also able to extend the solid solution limits of alloying elements and decreases composition segregation, thereby resulting in homogeneous textures [38].\nThis study aims to develop an Fe-based biocomposite containing homogenously dispersed Pd-rich IMPs and bredigite phase in order to (i) accelerate Fe degradation and (ii) improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility simultaneously. The Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites were fabricated by SLM. The effects of chemical composition on the microstructure, biodegradability and bioactivity of the biocomposites were systematically investigated. Particular attention was paid to exploring the potential mechanisms for the improved biodegradation and bioactivity. Additionally, the mechanical performance and in vitro cell behavior were also investigated in detail.\n\n\nExperimental\n\nMaterials and sample preparation\nFe powder (purity 99.9%, Shanghai Naiou Nano technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), bredigite powder (purity 99.9%, Kunshan Huaqiao Science and Technology New Material Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China), and Pd powder (purity 99.9%, Beijing Deke Island Gold Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were used as raw materials. A series of mixed powders were obtained by mixing the three powders using a ball mill (DECO-PBM-V-0.4L, Changsha Deco Equipment Co., Ltd., Changsha, China) at a rotational speed of 260\u202frpm for 4\u202fh. The morphology and composition of the powders were analyzed by using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (SEM\/EDS, Phenom Prox, Phenom-World BV, Eindhoven, Netherlands). The particle size distribution was measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Mastersizer 3000, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) with a Hydro EV dispersion unit. The mixed powders were then used for sample preparation on a custom-made SLM system with a laser power of 90\u202fW, a scanning speed of 20\u202fmm\u00b7s\u22121, a hatch distance of 0.08\u202fmm and a layer thickness of 0.1\u202fmm. The laser scan followed an oscillation deposition strategy with a rotation of \u223c67\u00b0 between successive layers to relieve stresses. It should be noted that the weight ratio of Pd in this study was set as 2 and 4\u202fwt%, respectively, as a higher amount of Pd may induce severe cytotoxicity [39]. The detailed composition of the prepared Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites is presented in Table 1\n.\n\n\nMicrostructural characterization\nFor metallographic analysis, the samples were mounted in epoxy and mechanically ground successively with 800, 1000 and 1600 grit sandpapers, and then polished with diamond pastes, followed by ultrasonic cleaning and air-drying. Subsequently, the metallographic structure of Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites was observed using an optical microscope (PMG3, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and the grain sizes were determined by the linear intercept method using the ImageJ software. In addition, the phase composition of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The scanning rate, accelerating voltage and current were set as 8\u00b0\u00b7min\u22121, 40\u202fkV and 100\u202fmA, respectively. To determine the distribution states of Pd and bredigite in the Fe matrix, the microstructure and elemental composition of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites were examined by the SEM\/EDS.\n\n\nMechanical tests\nThe compressive properties of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites were evaluated by compression tests, which were carried out on a universal testing machine (WDW-100M, Jinan Zhong Lu Chang Test Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Jinan, China) with a crosshead speed of 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124 m\u00b7min\u22121. The test samples were cylindrical with dimensions of 5\u202fmm in height and 2\u202fmm in diameter. In addition, the microhardness of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites was measured by a microhardness tester (HXD-1000TM\/LCD, Shanghai Taiming Optical Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) with a load of 2.94\u202fN and a dwell time of 15\u202fs. The morphology of the indentations was also observed using the SEM. At least five measurements were repeated for each group in all the mechanical tests.\n\n\nBiodegradation tests\nElectrochemical tests and immersion tests were both carried out in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37\u202f\u00b0C. The SBF solution consisted of (in g\u00b7L\u22121): 0.3050 MgCl2\u00b76H2O, 6.5453 NaCl, 0.2681 Na2HPO4\u00b77H2O, 0.3676 CaCl2\u00b72H2O, 0.3728 KCl, 2.2683 NaHCO3, 6.0570 (CH2OH)3CNH2, and 0.0711 NaSO4 according to the literature [40]. In addition, the pH of the SBF solution was adjusted to 7.4 by using hydrochloric acid (1\u202fmol\u00b7L\u22121). The electrochemical properties of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites were examined using an electrochemical workstation (CHI604D, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai, China). Prior to the tests, the samples were mounted in epoxy with a surface exposure of 1\u202fcm2, followed by grinding, polishing, cleaning and drying. During the electrochemical tests, the mounted samples acted as the working electrode while a saturated calomel electrode and a platinum electrode acted as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The open circuit potentials were stabilized by immersing the samples in the SBF solution. Afterwards, the potentiodynamic polarization curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 0.5\u202fmV\u00b7s\u22121. The corrosion potentials (Ecorr\n), corrosion current densities (Icorr\n) and degradation rates were then acquired obtained using the Tafel extrapolation method.\nImmersion tests were performed in the SBF at 37\u202f\u00b0C for 21 d. During immersion, the SBF solution was regularly replaced by a fresh one every 3 d to simulate the in-vivo corrosion environment. After immersion, the samples were ultrasonicated in ethanol and then dried at room temperature. The corrosion morphology and elemental composition after immersion were characterized by the SEM\/EDS. Afterwards, the samples were vigorously stirred in a solution containing 100\u202fmL hydrochloric acid, 5\u202fg stannous chloride, and 2\u202fg antimonous oxide to remove the corrosion products, followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol and blow-drying. The 3D surface profiles of the samples were then analyzed by a Veeco Wyko NT9100 optical profile tester (Veeco Instruments Inc., Plainview, USA).\n\n\nCell culture tests\n\nIn vitro cell culture tests were performed using an indirect contact method because the indirect method enables not only an extensive contact of the materials with cells but also an analysis of the toxic effects of various components and concentrations on cells. Human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, USA) were used to assess the in vitro cytocompatibility of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites. The MG-63 cells were pre-cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM), which contained 100 U\u00b7mL\u22121 penicillin, 100\u202fmg\u00b7mL\u22121 streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. At the same time, the samples were immersed in a separate DMEM with a sample surface area to extract a volume ratio of 1.25\u202fcm2\u00b7mL\u22121 for 3 d, which was determined to be consistent with that of the immersion tests for correlating the results of the two tests. The resulting extracts were collected for subsequent tests.\nTo evaluate the cell morphology, the MG-63 cells were incubated in DMEM at 37\u202f\u00b0C in 24-well plates. After 4\u202fh, the cultured medium of each well was replaced by the aforementioned extracts of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites. Meanwhile, a complete medium without extracts served as the control group. The cells were further cultured for 5 d, gently rinsed using a phosphate buffered solution, and then stained by Ethidium homodimer-1 and Calcein-AM reagents for 20\u202fmin. Afterwards, the cells were fixed with glass slides and a fluorescence microscope (BX60, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was employed to observe the cell morphology.\nFor cell viability tests, the MG-63 cells were cultured for 24\u202fh in 96-well plates with a seeding density of approximately 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 cells per 100\u202f\u03bcL DMEM, which was then replaced by the extracts. DMEM without extracts served as the control group. After 3 and 5 d of culture, a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) solution with a volume of 10\u202f\u03bcL was dropped into each well and the cells were continually cultured for 2\u202fh. Subsequently, the absorbance was determined using ParadigmTM Detection Platform (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) at a wavelength of 450\u202fnm, and the cell viability (V) was calculated according to Equation (1):\n\n(1)\n\n\nV\n=\nO\n\nD\ni\n\n\/\nO\n\nD\n0\n\n\n\n\nwhere ODi\n\n\n\n\n\nO\nD\n\ni\n\n\nis the mean absorbance of the experimental group and \n\n\n\nO\nD\n\n0\n\n\n\nOD0\n is the mean absorbance of the control group.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll experimental data were presented as mean values\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviations and statistically analyzed by ANOVA. The differences were considered significant when P\u202f<\u202f0.05.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nPowder characterization and SLM preparation\nThe morphology, composition and size distribution of the powders used in this study are shown in Fig. 1\n. It can be observed that the Fe powder consisted of light-gray particles in near-spherical shape and the quantitative result showed a particle size range of approximately 20\u2013100\u202f\u03bcm (Fig. 1a1 and a2). The EDS spectrum at point A presented strong peaks corresponding to only Fe (Fig. 1a3), indicating a high purity of the powder. In comparison, the dark-gray bredigite powder showed a mixture of large polygonal particles in tens of micrometers and small irregular particles in several micrometers (Fig. 1b1). The size distribution result indicated that most of the bredigite particles were in the size range of 17\u201330\u202f\u03bcm (Fig. 1b2). The EDS analysis at point B presented the typical peaks of Ca, Si, Mg and O (Fig. 1b3), corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio of bredigite. As observed from Fig. 1c1 and 1c2, the Pd particles presented a spherical morphology in bright colors and the particle size was distributed in the range of 1\u20136\u202f\u03bcm. The EDS spectrum at point C indicated strong peaks of Pd with no other elements (Fig. 1c3). The morphology of the ball-milled mixed powder is shown in Fig. 1d1, in which bredigite particles were observable among Fe particles and Pd was homogenously distributed on both of Fe and bredigite particles. This was further confirmed by the EDS spectra at areas A and B (Fig. 1d2 and 1d3). A surface profile of the original Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites is shown in Fig. 1e, which presents a typical rough surface by SLM technology due to balling or partially melted powder [41,42].\n\n\nMicrostructure and phase compositions of the SLM composites\nThe metallographs and corresponding grain size distribution of the prepared Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites are shown in Fig. 2\n. It can be observed that all the biocomposites possess a regular microstructure mainly consisting of equiaxed grains. The grain size of the biocomposites gradually decreased with the increase in Pd and bredigite. Specifically, there was a 20\u201328% decrease in grain size between the Fe-2Pd-xbredigite and the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites, but no significant difference in the uniformity of grain size distribution can be observed. For the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite biocomposites, the grain size distribution was relatively uniform with average values of 38.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.6\u202f\u03bcm and 30.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1\u202f\u03bcm, respectively. In comparison, the average grain sizes of the Fe-xPd-5bredigite biocomposites were approximately 33.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.9\u202f\u03bcm and 24.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5\u202f\u03bcm, respectively, which were smaller than those of the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite biocomposites. Bredigite (indicated by red arrows) was found homogeneously distributed along the grain boundaries in both the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite and Fe-xPd-5bredigite biocomposites. Nevertheless, many conglomerations appeared at the grain boundaries of the Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites, as indicated by the red rectangles. Moreover, grains with a large variety of sizes and shapes were also observed, especially around those conglomerations. The different grain sizes among the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites could be attributed to the different contents of solid phases, which were believed to inhibit grain growth by promoted supercooling and heterogeneous nucleation.\nTo reveal the microstructure and compositions of the biocomposites, the typical features of the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite were examined using the SEM\/EDS. The backscattered electron SEM image in Fig. 3\na shows a homogeneous and relatively dense microstructure with different brightness. It was evident that the gray areas corresponded to the Fe matrix. A bright contrast was observed along the grain boundaries, suggesting the enrichment of an element with high atomic weight. Moreover, the enrichment was distributed throughout the grain boundaries, leading to the formation of a nearly continuous network. In addition, some dark areas were also observed within the matrix. EDS image analysis inside the grains (Point A) showed strong peaks of Fe and Pd with a Pd content of 2.49\u202fwt%, which was close to the solubility limit of Pd in Fe. The spectrum of the bright contrast at Point B also showed the peaks of Fe and Pd, except for an elevated Pd content of 9.13\u202fwt%. This implied that Pd was segregated into Pd-rich precipitates at the grain boundaries. The spectrum at Point C (the dark areas) consisted of O, Ca, Si and Mg with atom ratios close to the nominal composition of bredigite. EDS mapping was also performed to obtain a general overview of element distribution, and the results confirmed the enrichment of Pd along the grain boundaries. XRD analysis was conducted to determine the phase composition of the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite with Fe and the raw powders as the control (Fig. 3b). As can be observed in the spectra, the raw powders showed typical peaks for Fe (JCPDS card no. 06-0696), Pd (JCPDS card no. 46-1043) and bredigite (JCPDS 36-0399), respectively. After laser melting, the XRD pattern of Fe was similar to that of the Fe powder without detectable peak shifts or phase changes. For the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite, Fe was detected as the major phase with small amount of bredigite, but no Pd-rich IMPs were detected because of the limitation of the XRD technique. According to the SEM\/EDS and XRD results, the biocomposite presented the coexistence of Fe and bredigite phases, and Pd existed as both solid solution inside the Fe grains and Pd-rich IMPs along the grain boundaries.\n\n\nElectrochemical behavior and in vitro degradation\nTo separate the effect of surface roughness from that of the chemical composition, a surface grinding and polishing process was performed before the electrochemical and degradation tests. The electrochemical behavior of the biocomposites was evaluated in the SBF using a short-term polarization measurement and the corresponding potentiodynamic polarization curves are plotted in Fig. 4\na. With increasing Pd and bredigite contents, the anodic Tafel slopes became sharper and the polarization curves shifted toward higher current densities, indicating the faster dissolution of the Fe matrix. Moreover, the polarization curves showed obvious current plateaus, which revealed a passivation behavior during corrosion. Similar phenomenon has been reported in Zinc (Zn)-hydroxyapatite (HAP) composites [43]. The Ecorr\n, Icorr\n and degradation rates of the biocomposites were determined by the Tafel extrapolation method and are displayed in Fig. 4b\u2013d. It can be observed that the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites slightly shifted by approximately \u22120.038, \u22120.108 and \u22120.091\u202fV, respectively, as compared with the Fe-2Pd-xbredigite biocomposites. This may be associated with the solubility limit (up to 2\u202fwt% [19]) of Pd in Fe according to the phase diagram. In this case, the residual Pd in the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites would precipitate into Pd-rich IMPs and form micro-galvanic cells with the matrix. This led to the shifting of the Icorr\n toward much higher values, i.e., from 17.78, 31.62 and 39.81 \u03bcA\u00b7cm\u22122 for Fe-2Pd-xbredigite biocomposites to 34.67, 50.12 and 63.09 \u03bcA\u00b7cm\u22122 for the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites, thereby accelerating the corrosion process. For the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites, the degradation rates were 0.41, 0.6 and 0.76\u202fmm\u00b7y\u22121, respectively, which were higher than those of the Fe-2Pd-xbredigite biocomposites. In addition, the biocomposites containing more bredigite generally featured higher degradation rates. This behavior was especially noticeable for Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites, which was about twice that of the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite biocomposites. Compared with bredigite, Pd showed a better improvement in the degradation rate of Fe. The most remarkable improvements were attained in Fe-4Pd-5bredigite and the Fe-4Pd-10bredigite biocomposites, which both contained high amounts of Pd-rich IMPs and bredigite phase.\nStatic immersion tests were conducted to investigate the long-term degradation behavior of the biocomposites. The degradation morphology and element composition after 21 d of immersion were analyzed using the SEM\/EDS, as shown in Fig. 5\n. It was worth noting that the grain boundaries were generally the preferred attacked sites of corrosion due to the existence of both Pd-rich IMPs and bredigite. The surface of the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite was partially covered with a compact and smooth product layer in dark-gray color. The EDS spectrum at Point A revealed Fe and O as the main elements of the corrosion products. Additionally, a few worm-like sediments (indicated at Point B) together with fine and spherical crystallites (indicated at Point C) were also observed at the grain boundaries. Corresponding element analysis showed the co-existence of significant amounts of Ca, Mg and O along with small amounts of Pd, P, Si, Na and C. Because P, Na and C were only present in the SBF solution, the crystallites can thus be identified as apatites while Pd and Si originated from the degradation of the biocomposite. In contrast, the Fe-4Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite were fully covered by broccoli-like products, which were composed of a mixture of Fe oxides and apatites and no clear boundaries were distinguishable between the Fe oxides and apatites. This revealed a strong corrosion attack caused by the galvanic corrosion between Pd-rich IMPs and the Fe matrix. Moreover, the product layer appeared to be loose and porous, which enabled the easy penetration of the corrosion medium into the underneath fresh matrix, thereby accelerating the corrosion process. With increased bredigite content, the corrosion morphology was characterized by more apatite precipitation as well as slight changes in the amount of corrosion products owing to the invasion of the corrosion medium via the Fe-bredigite interfaces. The enhanced apatite precipitation was mainly attributed to the excellent bioactivity of bredigite, which could encourage the precipitation of Ca- and P-containing phases. In the presence of corrosion products, the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite and Fe-xPd-5bredigite biocomposites almost maintained a uniform corrosion mode while localized corrosion with corrosion cavities (as indicated by red rectangles) was observed in the Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites, which might be due to the bredigite conglomerations at the grain boundaries.\nTo clarify the spatial corrosion process, the 3D surface profile of the biocomposites after product removal is shown in Fig. 6\n. The color legends displayed on the top left corner of the insets represent the height from the highest points with red to the lowest points with blue. As indicated, the height difference varies with the contents of Pd and bredigite, corresponding to different corrosion features. The Fe-4Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite showed much severe corrosion compared with the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite (height difference of 103.01\u202f\u03bcm vs. 64.81\u202f\u03bcm). This phenomenon was also present in Fe-xPd-5bredigite and the Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites. The intensified corrosion at higher Pd content can be attributed to the large volume fraction of Pd-rich IMPs formed at the grain boundaries, which promoted micro-galvanic corrosion and increased the dissolution of Fe. Additionally, the presence of excessive interfaces in the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites was also responsible for the intensified corrosion by providing more opportunities for the permeation and diffusion of the corrosion medium. In comparison, the height difference first decreased with increasing bredigite from 2.5\u202fwt% to 5\u202fwt% and then increased with increasing bredigite from 5\u202fwt% to 10\u202fwt%, demonstrating a corrosion mode transition from uneven corrosion for Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite to uniform corrosion for Fe-xPd-5bredigite and then localized corrosion for Fe-xPd-10bredigite. It can be observed that the Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites corroded most severely with deep corrosion pits on the surface. According to the aforementioned discussion, the excessive bredigite could account for these corrosion pits because the conglomerations observed in Fig. 2 can easily induce the nucleation and growth of localized corrosion. This was likely to induce a self-driven intense pit development and finally a total disintegration of the biocomposites. In general, the 3D topographic results demonstrated similar effects of Pd and bredigite on the corrosion behavior as revealed in the SEM characterization and potentiodynamic tests. The Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite showed a relatively smooth corrosion morphology with corrosion damage mostly distributed horizontally, indicating a rapid corrosion rate and uniform corrosion mode. Therefore, combined with the voluminous apatite precipitation shown in Fig. 5, the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite may feature the most attractive biodegradability and bioactivity.\n\n\nMechanical properties\nThe mechanical properties of the biocomposites were investigated by compression tests and microhardness tests and the results are plotted as bar charts in Fig. 7\n. The compressive yield strength (CYS) of the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite reached a value of 161\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fMPa and a slight increase was observed with increasing Pd to 4\u202fwt%. Moreover, the addition of Pd also showed a similar effect on the microhardness of the biocomposites. The microhardness of the Fe-4Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite presented a \u223c6% increase as compared with that of the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite. The improvement in mechanical properties could be attributed to the grain refinement, solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening induced by the dissolved Pd within the matrix and the uniformly dispersed Pd-rich IMPs along the grain boundaries. In comparison, bredigite had an opposite influence on the CYS of the biocomposites. The Fe-2Pd-5bredigite biocomposite showed a \u223c9% drop in CYS as compared with the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite biocomposite, followed by a pronounced decrease of \u223c15% with 10\u202fwt% bredigite addition. A similar trend was also observed in the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite biocomposites. The negative influence of bredigite on the CYS might be due to the microstructure inhomogeneity in the biocomposites, such as interfacial mismatch and different deformation mechanisms between metallic and ceramic phases. Moreover, bredigite showed a dual impact on the microhardness. The microhardness of the Fe-xPd-5bredigite biocomposites was 4\u20136% higher than that of the Fe-xPd-2.5bredigite biocomposites, which could be ascribed to the uniform distribution of the hard bredigite phase within the matrix. However, a significant reduction could be seen in Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites. The mechanical deterioration could be due to brought about by the bredigite conglomerations, causing a weak bonding between the bredigite and matrix. The relatively larger standard deviations also suggested the microstructural inhomogeneity in the Fe-xPd-10bredigite biocomposites.\n\n\nCytocompatibility\nCell culture tests were conducted to assess the cytocompatibility of the biocomposites by using MG-63 cells. The biocomposites were separately immersed in DMEM for 3 d and the extracts were then collected and used for cell culture. The cells cultured in DMEM without the extracts served the control. The fluorescence morphology of the cells after 5 d of culture is shown in Fig. 8\n, in which the live and dead cells are stained in green and red, respectively. It was evident that all the images showed high cell densities with no significant differences among the extracts and the control group, indicating normal proliferation of the cells. Moreover, as can be observed in the higher magnification images, the cells basically maintained a spindle or polygonal morphology with spike-like filopodia, indicating benign responses to the extracts [44]. In addition, the number of live cells slightly decreased as the Pd content increased. This was also revealed by the images of dead cells cultured in the Fe-4Pd-xbredigite and the Fe-2Pd-xbredigite extracts. In comparison, the live cells presented no visible differences in density among the extracts with different bredigite contents. Furthermore, the cell viabilities of MG-63 cells after 3 and 5 d of culture in the extracts were investigated by CCK-8 tests and the results are expressed as a percentage of that in the control group (Fig. 9\n). It can be observed that the cell viabilities in the extracts all increased with the prolonged culture period and maintained a value of more than 80%, indicating favorable cytocompatibility of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites to MG-63 cells according to ISO 19003-5. Moreover, the cell viability decreased after being cultured in the Fe-4Pd-2.5bredigite extract compared with the Fe-2Pd-2.5bredigite extract (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), as well as in the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite extract compared with the Fe-2Pd-5bredigite extract (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). As for the Fe-4Pd-10bredigite and the Fe-2Pd-10bredigite extracts, cell viability showed no significant difference at 3 d but significant difference at 5 d (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). It is known that cell proliferation is closely related to the ionic environment of the culture medium [45]. In the present work, on one hand, the degradation rate of the biocomposites was significantly increased with both the contents of Pd and bredigite, which would result in much more release of Fe and Pd ions. This could induce some inhibitory effect on the proliferation of MG-63 cells. On the other hand, the fast release of Ca, Si and Mg ions induced by bredigite degradation might have helped improve the cell proliferation. These results revealed the favorable biocompatibility of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites to MG-63 cells.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nAn ideal bone implant should have strong bonding with the defective sites, act as a temporary support for cell function, and gradually degrade along with bone tissue regeneration [46,47]. For load-bearing sites, metallic biomaterials are almost the only choice because of the excellent mechanical strengths and processability compared to ceramics and polymers. As a biodegradable metal, Fe has been proposed as potential bone implant biomaterials, but the researchers have long been puzzled by the slow degradation and poor bioactivity.\n\nMechanical properties\nIn the present work, Pd and bredigite were first combined to improve both the corrosion behavior and bioactivity of Fe for biomedical applications. It is widely accepted that the performance of metal-based composites mainly depends on the microstructure and composition, i.e., the solution elements and precipitates. As revealed by the SEM\/EDS images, Pd was partially dissolved in the Fe matrix and the rest formed a nearly continuous network of Pd-rich IMPs along the grain boundaries. In addition, the bredigite phase was also found distributed throughout the biocomposites. The grain size of the Fe matrix gradually decreased with the increase in Pd and bredigite contents. The solid IMPs and bredigite phase were believed to inhibit the grain growth by promoting supercooling and heterogeneous nucleation. In addition, the rapid heating and cooling process of SLM should also be taken into consideration for the grain refinement. As a result, the refined grain size, together with the dissolved Pd and dispersed Pd-rich IMPs, contributed to the improvement of CYS by immobilizing dislocations and thus inducing more deformation resistance. In comparison, bredigite showed a negative influence on CYS, which be due to the microstructure inhomogeneity, such as interfacial mismatch and different deformation mechanisms between metals and ceramics [48]. Nevertheless, the microhardness of the biocomposites was improved after the addition of bredigite, which could be ascribed to the uniform distribution of the hard bredigite phase within the matrix. Consequently, the CYS and microhardness of the Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites were tailored to 164\u202fMPa and 140 HV, respectively, which were comparable to those of the native bone [49,50].\n\n\nDegradation behavior\n\nFig. 10\n illustrates the corrosion process of the prepared Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites in the SBF solution. It is known that grain boundaries are relatively distorted areas with a configuration of dislocations and lattice mismatch [51,52]. When immersed in the SBF solution, corrosion first started from the Fe matrix closely around the Pd-rich IMPs at the grain boundaries. The Pd-rich IMPs with high corrosion potential as cathodes formed micro-galvanic cells with the Fe matrix as anodes. The Fe matrix was then oxidized into ferrous ions, and the electrons generated from the dissolving Fe were transferred to the Pd-rich IMPs where the electrons were consumed by oxygen reduction (Fig. 10a). This resulted in solution alkalization near the IMPs, followed by the formation of ferrous hydroxide and ferric hydroxide at the early stage of immersion. As aforementioned, the IMPs consisted of high amounts of Pd with a high standard reduction potential. Therefore, the resulting Pd-rich IMPs were expected to be much nobler than the Fe matrix. The large potential difference promoted the electron transfer and thus the reaction rate of anodes. Moreover, the Pd-rich IMPs existed as a nearly continuous network along the grain boundaries, indicating the large amount of micro-galvanic cells in the biocomposites. Thus, the presence of the Pd-rich IMPs induced tremendous micro-galvanic corrosion significantly increasing the corrosion rate of the Fe matrix.\nIn addition, the physical presence of the bredigite phase generated more sites that were vulnerable to corrosion attack due to the excellent biodegradability [53]. As a promising bioactive ceramics, bredigite can rapidly hydrolyze in a biological environment. It has been reported that the biodegradation rate of bredigite was faster than those of HAP [54], diopside and akermanite bioceramics [55], and was comparable to that of \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate bioceramics [56], which was known for the very fast degradation for bone repair [57]. Thus, the bredigite phase would rapidly corrode and dissolve from the Fe matrix, leaving corrosion pits in situ (Fig. 10b). These corrosion pits exposed more Fe matrix to the corrosion medium, thereby accelerating the corrosion process. Furthermore, bredigite and Fe belong to ceramics and metals, respectively, with different physiochemical properties. Some defects or even conglomerations at the Fe-bredigite interfaces after the SLM process could result. The interfacial defects acted as channels for further invasion of the corrosion medium into the Fe matrix. These were confirmed by the electrochemical and immersion results, in which the corrosion rate increased with bredigite content. Similar influences of ceramic phase on the interfacial characteristics and corrosion behavior of metallic matrix were also reported in many other MMCs, such as Zn-HAP composites [43] and Fe-HAP composites [58]. Moreover, bredigite contributed to the spontaneous absorption and induction of Ca2+ and PO4\n3\u2013 deposition from the SBF solution, thus leading to the rapid apatite formation on the Fe surface. Previous studies have also reported that bredigite possessed higher bioactivity than HAP and could stimulate apatite nucleation and growth, which is beneficial for the rapid synostosis with the native bone [59]. With time, the corrosion area rapidly expanded into the fresh Fe matrix beneath the IMPs and bredigite (Fig. 10c). Then, the exposed Fe matrix was further corroded and replaced by voluminous degradation products and apatite layer. Therefore, the newly developed Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites, especially the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite, featured a significantly accelerated degradation and excellent bioactivity.\n\n\nCytocompatibility\nBiocompatibility is still the biggest hindrance of biodegradable metallic implants for biomedical applications. This issue is mainly caused by the released metallic ions and degradation products which can affect cell metabolic activities and proliferation. In the present work, it can be observed that the biocomposites showed increased cytotoxicity after the addition of Pd. On one hand, the cytotoxicity should be mainly attributed to the released Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. It has been reported that excess Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions would catalyze the formation of radicals, thereby damaging the cell structure [60]. The galvanic cells formed between Pd-rich IMPs and the Fe matrix significantly accelerated the degradation of the biocomposites, resulting in a rapid release of large amounts of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. On the other hand, Pd ions are capable of eliciting in vitro a number of cytotoxic effects by stimulating free radical production and the degree of cytotoxicity corresponds to the solubility of Pd compounds [61,62]. In this study, the concentration of Pd ions released was very low because Pd had a very limited dissolution in the human body and showed nontoxicity in elemental form. Moreover, the released Pd ions can also be rapidly excreted from the body via the feces and urine. Recent studies also reported acceptable cytocompatibility of Pd at 2\u202fwt% and 5\u202fwt% [63]. Moreover, bredigite is one of the frequently used bioactive ceramics for bone repair owing to the excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. The release of Ca2+, Si4+ and Mg2+ from bredigite could stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation and then promote new bone formation. Furthermore, the Ca-Mg-P precipitates induced by bredigite have been proven to facilitate the adsorption of cell-related proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin [54]. Therefore, although the adverse effects of Pd exerted on cell proliferation were observed, the morphology and proliferation of MG-63 cells cultured in the extracts were comparable with those in the control group, which indicated high biocompatibility of the biocomposites without noticeable cytotoxicity.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present work aimed to develop an Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposite with a well-balanced combination of accelerated degradation, excellent bioactivity, suitable mechanical properties and favorable cytocompatibility for biomedical applications.\n\n(1)\nMost Pd formed noble IMPs as a nearly continuous network along the grain boundaries.

Oil spills in the natural environment cause catastrophic effects on the environment and ecosystem [1\u20133]. Various methods have been developed to solve this serious problem, such as physical [4\u20137], chemical [8\u201310], and biological [11\u201313] approaches. The physical adsorption by an adsorbent is considered to be an efficient technique for the treatment of oil spills because it is simple, environmentally friendly, and requires low costs. The method involves using a sorbent to collect and transform the liquid oil into a semi-solid or solid phase that can be easily removed from the contaminated site. Generally, sorbent materials can be classified into three groups: synthetic materials [14\u201316], inorganic minerals [17\u201319], and natural products [20\u201323].\nCurrently, three-dimensional hydrophobic and oleophilic porous materials are popular candidates for the oil absorption of spills because of their suitable selectivities for oil and organic solvents, high absorption capacities, and excellent reusability and oil recovery. However, most reported studies have focused on synthetic materials, such as polyurethane foam [14\u201316], poly(tetrahydrofuran) [3], and polydimethylsiloxane sponges [24\u201327]. The disadvantages of these synthetic sorbents are their high production costs and large waste volumes. Although polystyrene [28,29] is cheap and lightweight, it burns easily and produces toxic combustion fume. Thus, natural rubber (NR) is a more interesting alternative.\nNatural rubber (NR) is an important renewable polymeric material with outstanding flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. It can be easily produced as NR foam, which has a high porosity, low density, and strong hydrophobic property [30,31]. Therefore, NR foams are good candidates as oil sorbent materials. Several techniques have been studied to improve the oil adsorption capacity of NR foams, including chemical modifications [32,33] and the preparation of composite materials [26,34\u201337].\nIn this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was added to NR to improve its oil adsorption capacity because the chemical rGO structure is similar to that of graphene and it has a high surface area and tensile strength [2,38,39]. Further, it causes fewer costs than graphene. Additionally, rGO is compatible with the NR matrix owing to its hydrophobic property, which enables a more homogenously mixed phase. To create the green composite material, rGO was synthesized from graphite waste obtained from a metal smelting company. Based on the previous study presented in [40], rGO was prepared by the Hummer\u2019s method. The rGO was used to improve the conductivity and mechanical properties of the NR vulcanizates. Therefore, its functions were investigated in the present study. The focus of this study was to design and prepare a novel NR\/rGO (NRG) oil adsorption composite. The high elasticity of the NR and the highly active surface area of the rGO led to an enhanced oil absorptivity and stability of the composite under working conditions. The sorption mechanisms were intensively investigated to determine the factors that affect the oil sorption performance of the composite. The results of this extensive study might provide useful guidelines for the further development and exploitation of NR for environmental conservation purposes.\nMore specifically, the aim of this research study was to study the influence of the rGO content on the oil adsorption capacity of an NRG foam composite material with respect to the properties of pure NR foam and commercial polypropylene sorbent pads (CM). The relationship between the morphology and adsorption capacity of the different sorbent materials was investigated. Further, the effects of the temperature and waves on the oil adsorption capacity of each sorbent material were examined for their applications in real oil spill removals in marine environments. The kinetics and adsorption isotherms of the obtained sorbent materials were evaluated and their oil adsorption mechanisms proposed. Finally, the reusability of the selected NRG sorbent was examined in comparison to that of the CM sorbent.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nMaterials\nThe graphite waste was obtained from a local metal smelting company (Mahamek Flow Innovation Co., Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand), and the sulfuric acid (98% (w\/v); H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (36% (w\/v); HCl), and L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) were purchased from QREC Chemical Ltd. (Chonburi, Thailand). The sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Ajax Finechem Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand). Further, the high-ammonia NR latex (60% dry rubber content) and following curing agents: 10% potassium oleate (K-oleate) dispersion, 50% sulfur dispersion, 50% zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDEC) dispersion, 50% zinc-2-mercaptobenzothiazole (ZMBT) dispersion, 50% Wingstay\u00aeL, 33% dipropylene glycol (DPG) dispersion, 50% zinc oxide (ZnO) dispersion, and 12.5% sodium silicofluoride (SSF) dispersion originate from the Rubber Research Institute, Bangkok, Thailand. The gasoline (density of 0.74\u202fg\/cm3 and viscosity of 1.42\u202fmPa) and crude AXL oil (density of 0.84\u202fg\/cm3 and viscosity of 3.80\u202fmPa) were purchased from PTT Public Co., Ltd., and Thai Oil PCL Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand, respectively. The commercial polypropylene sorbent pad (CM) originates from Surface Pro-Tech Co., Ltd. (Chonburi, Thailand).\n\n\nSynthesis of rGO\nThe procedure for the rGO synthesis was performed according to the modified Hummer\u2019s method [37] and was followed by a reduction with L-AA [38,41,42]. The graphite waste (3\u202fg) was added to 60\u202fmL concentrated H2SO4 under agitation in an ice bath at 10\u202f\u00b0C. Then, KMnO4 (9\u202fg) was slowly added, followed by the careful addition of 150\u202fmL deionized water under stirring and heating to 95\u202f\u00b0C for 15\u202fmin before an ultrasonic treatment at room temperature for 30\u202fmin. The mixture was then adjusted to pH 8\u20139 through the addition of 1\u202fM NaOH solution, whereupon 0.5\u202fM L-AA was added to the colloidal solution. The reaction was stirred at 95\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. The resultant black precipitate was filtered through Whatman (No. 40) filer paper, washed with 1.0\u202fM HCl and then deionized water until the filtrated water exhibited a pH value of 7. The final product (rGO) was dried in an oven at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh.\n\n\nCharacterization of rGO\nRaman spectroscopy was conducted with a DXR Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). A 780\u202fnm laser was used as light source with a spot size of approximately 3\u202f\u00b5m. The Raman spectra were recorded from 800 to 1800\u202fcm\u22121.\nFurther, water contact angle measurements were carried out with a ram\u00e9-hart instrument (New Jersey, USA) at ambient temperature. The powder sample was pasted onto a glass slide with an adhesive tape. The water contact angle was measured by placing a 50\u202f\u03bcL deionized-water droplet onto the sample surface with a micro-syringe. Each sample was measured from five different positions and evaluated with the averaged values.\nThe morphologies of the graphite, graphite oxide (GO), and rGO were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (TECNAI 20, Philips, Oregon, USA). A sample (0.1\u202fg) in absolute ethanol was sonicated in a sonication bath for 15\u202fmin followed by a vortex treatment for 5\u202fmin. Afterward, the colloidal solution was dropped onto the TEM grid.\n\n\nPreparation of NR and NRG sorbent materials\nThe formulations for the NR and different NRG-X (where\u202fX\u202fis the rGO content in parts by weight per hundred parts of rubber; phr) foam sorbents used in this study are shown in Table 1\n. The NR latex and all curing agents were mixed in a cake mixer at room temperature, compounded with the desired amount of rGO (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 phr), quickly poured into an aluminum mold, and vulcanized at 100\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fh. The vulcanized NR and NRG-X foams were then washed with water to remove unreacted elements. Finally, they were dried in an oven at 60\u202f\u00b0C for 24\u202fh.\n\n\nCharacterization of sorbent materials\nThe morphologies of the sorbent materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6480LV; Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 10\u202fkV. The sorbent materials were cut and stitched onto an SEM stub and coated with gold before the SEM analysis.\nThe surface wettabilities of the sorbent materials were measured by dropping 0.1\u202fmL of water, seawater, and crude oil onto each sorbent surface at room temperature. The digital images of the liquid droplets were recorded at a magnification of 2.5.\nDynamic mechanical properties of NR composite foam were examined by dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA, GABO, model EPLEXOR QC 100, Ahlden, Germany). The sample size was 8\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202fmm\u202f\u00d7\u202f4\u202fmm. The tensile mode was used at a frequency of 10\u202fHz, a static strain of 1.0% and a dynamic strain of 0.1%. The temperature was in the range of \u2212100\u202f\u00b0C to 80\u202f\u00b0C with a heating rate of 2\u202f\u00b0C\/min.\n\n\nDetermination of oil sorption capacity\nThe method for the determination of the oil adsorption capacity was based on the standard test method for the adsorbent performance (ASTM F726-12). The oil sorption experiment was conducted by pouring 3\u202fg oil into 100\u202fmL water or seawater. The sorbent materials were cut into cubes (0.7\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.7\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.7\u202fcm3) and weighed before their immersion into the oil\u2013water or oil\u2013seawater systems. After 15\u202fmin, the sorbents were removed from the systems. The excess oil on the sorbent surface was removed, and the sorbents were weighed. The effects of the temperature (4\u201370\u202f\u00b0C) and waves (0\u2013200 revolutions per minute: rpm) were investigated. The waves were generated by a shaker (VS-202P, Vision Scientific Co., Ltd., Korea) at room temperature. The sorption capacity (%) was calculated with Eq. (1)\n[43]:\n\n(1)\n\n\nQ\n\n(\ng\n\u00b7\n\ng\n\n-\n1\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n1\n\n-\n\nW\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n0\n\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere Q is the oil adsorption capacity (g g\u22121), and W0\n and W1\n represent the initial weight and weight of the foam after the adsorption, respectively.\nTo assess the reusability of the sorbents, the oil was removed from the saturated sorbent by squeezing. Next, the sorbent was weighed and immersed again into the oil\u2013seawater system. This adsorption\u2013desorption cycle was performed for up to 30 cycles to determine the oil removal efficiency (Re) [32]:\n\n(2)\n\n\nR\ne\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n(\n\nW\n1\n\n-\n\nW\n0\n\n)\n\n\nW\n1\n\n\n\u00d7\n100\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic and isotherm studies\nThe pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models are expressed in Eqs.

(6) and (7) to estimate the maximal amount of adsorbed oil [47\u201349]:\n\n(6)\n\n\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\nQ\ne\n\n\n=\n\n1\n\n\nQ\nm\n\n\nk\nL\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\nQ\nm\n\n\n,\n\nwhere\n\n\nR\nL\n\n=\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\nk\nL\n\n\nC\no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nln\n\n\nQ\ne\n\n=\nln\n\n\nk\nF\n\n+\n\n1\nn\n\nln\n\n\nC\ne\n\n\n\n\nwhere Qm\n and Qe\n are the maximal adsorption capacity (g g\u22121) and the amount of adsorbed oil at equilibrium, respectively; Ce\n (g L\u22121) is the oil concentration at equilibrium, and kL\n (L g\u22121) is the Langmuir constant that is related to the adsorption energy. An important characteristic of the Langmuir isotherm is the separation factor (RL\n), which expresses the adsorption nature as irreversible (RL\n\u202f=\u202f0), favorable (0\u202f<\u202fRL\n\u202f<\u202f1), linear (RL\n\u202f=\u202f1), or unfavorable (RL\n\u202f>\u202f1) [49]; Co\n (g L\u22121) is the initial oil concentration. The term kF\n (g g\u22121) is the Freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity. The slope 1\/n describes the adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity [47].\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nTextural properties of rGO\nThe Raman spectra of the graphite, GO, and rGO are shown in Fig. 1\n. The Raman spectrum of graphite exhibits a strong G band at 1580\u202fcm\u22121, which is related to the in-plane vibrations of the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms [50,51]. The weak D band corresponding to the presence of vacancies or dislocations in the graphene layer and at the edges is approximately located at 1300\u202fcm\u22121\n[51,52]. The Raman spectra of GO and rGO exhibit broad G and D (with high intensities) bands owing to the disordered arrangements of the carbon planes.\nThe TEM image (Fig. 2\n) of the graphite displays a dark flake due to the stacking of multi-layer graphene sheets through van der Waal forces. The GO structure was more transparent and consisted of few-layer sheets after the oxidation process. The oxygen-containing groups destroyed the van der Waal interactions among the graphene sheets of the GO structure. Thus, the graphene sheets were easily separated by the exfoliation step. After the reduction, the transparent rGO had few thin sheets with typical wrinkled and scrolled structures.\nA high contact angle was obtained for graphite (151\u00b0), as shown in Fig. 2, whereas that of rGO tended to decrease (133\u00b0) owing to the different surface wettability of the graphite after the chemical treatment through the modified Hummer\u2019s method. Unfortunately, the wettability measurements could not be conducted for the GO sample owing to its high hydrophobicity originating from the oxygen-containing groups in the GO.\n\n\nMorphologies of sorbent materials\nThe SEM images of each sorbent material are shown in Fig. 3\n. The morphologies of the NR and different NRG-X sorbent materials exhibited open-cell structures with spherical shapes. Each cell structure consisted of pores of various sizes. The cell sizes of the NRG-X composite materials tended to increase with increasing rGO content owing to the rGO interference during the foaming process. The aggregation or agglomeration of rGO particles was evident (inset in Fig. 3) and became more evident with increasing rGO content. This result implies that the aggregation\/agglomeration of rGO particles might affect not only the formation of the cell structure but also the composite properties in terms of mechanical, thermal, physical, or electrical properties [40]. By contrast, the CM sorbent exhibited an entangled fibrous structure of various sizes.\n\n\nSurface and viscoelastic properties of sorbent materials\n\nFig. 4\n compares the surface wettabilities of the sorbent materials for water, seawater, and crude AXL oil on the sorbent surfaces. Each sorbate exhibited a different behavior during the adsorption process. Among the three sorbent materials (NR, NRG-0.5, and CM), the water or seawater droplet was more stable (with a half-spherical shape and contact angle of 124\u00b0) on the CM, which implies that the surface of the CM sorbent was more hydrophobic. However, the hydrophobicities of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents tended to decrease, as indicated by the decreased contact angles (74\u00b0 and 83\u00b0, respectively). Further, the water and seawater droplet shapes became oval. Owing to the insignificant difference between the water contact angles of NR and NRG-0.5, it can be concluded that the added rGO in the NR was compatible with the NR surface. However, the surfaces of NR and NRG-0.5 were highly porous. The sorbate (water or seawater) could penetrate into the pores, thereby resulting in a decreased contact angle. Accordingly, these three sorbent materials could adsorb the crude oil well. The adsorption of highly viscous oil causes the formation of a shear layer of large volume across the sorbent surface. The dispersion of crude oil on the CM surface during the adsorption led to a larger coverage compared with those on the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbent materials. This was due to the different morphologies of the sorbents. Regarding the CM, the diffused oil traveled along the fiber length, whereas those of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents penetrated the pores. The dynamic mechanical properties of NR composite foams were shown in Fig. 5\n. The presence of rGO in the rubbery matrix did not affect the viscoelastic properties in terms of the storage modulus (E\u2032) and tan \u03b4, due to dilution effect of rGO.\n\n\nAdsorption abilities of sorbent materials\n\nOil adsorption\nThe adsorption performances of the sorbent materials for different aqueous media are shown in Fig. 6\n. Two types of oil (gasoline and crude AXL oil) were used as representatives of a petroleum oil leakage. In the oil\u2013water system (Fig. 6(a)), the oil adsorption capacity of the NRG-X composite foams was higher (1.2\u20131.36 times and 1.5\u20131.98 times for gasoline and crude oil, respectively) than that of the NR foam. This was because the rGO content in the NR foam created an increased surface area for the sorbent materials, thereby resulting in an enhanced oil adsorption. The oil adsorption increased with increasing rGO levels up to 0.5 phr. However, the addition of more than 0.5 phr rGO in the NR foam decreased the oil adsorption capacity because the petroleum oil could not be retained in the large pores of the sorbent matrix, as discussed in the previous section.\nIn the oil\u2013seawater system (Fig. 6(b)), the oil adsorption of the sorbent materials was slightly (<1.2-fold) higher than that in the oil\u2013water system, which was due to the effect of salinity, ions, and foreign matter. The salinity in seawater can increase the electrical double layer between the sorbate and sorbent materials, thereby leading to an increased oil adsorption capacity [53]. The maximal oil adsorption performance was obtained with NRG-0.5. Thus, the NRG-0.5 sorbent was selected for further studies.\nFurthermore, the oil adsorption capacity depended on the density and viscosity of the oil. The lowly viscous oil (gasoline) could easily diffuse on the surface and immediately penetrate the sorbent pores, whereas the highly viscous oil (crude AXL oil) remained at the sorbent surface and retarded the oil penetration into the interior pore structure. Accordingly, the sorbent materials swelled more rapidly with a lowly viscous oil than with a highly viscous oil.\nThe oil adsorption capacities of the CM, NR, and NRG-0.5 sorbents were evaluated for constant weights and volumes (0.05\u202fg and 0.34\u202fcm3). The oil adsorption capacity of the CM sorbent in the oil\u2013water or oil\u2013seawater systems was remarkably lower (30\u201340%) than those of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents. Moreover, the effect of the oil viscosity on the adsorption performance of the CM did not change noticeably. This was due to the different morphological structures of CM compared with those of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents.\n\n\n\nEffect of environmental conditions\nThe application of these sorbent materials to a marine oil spill situation was the main objective of this study. Accordingly, the effects of environmental marine conditions (temperature and waves) on the adsorption capacities for crude AXL oil of the different sorbent materials (NR, NRG-0.5, and CM) were examined. The results are presented in Fig. 7\n. When the temperature increased from 4 to 45\u202f\u00b0C and 100\u202frpm waves were created, the oil adsorption capacities of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents increased 3 and 2.4 times, respectively. However, they decreased at higher temperatures (60 and 70\u202f\u00b0C) with a maximal capacity at 45\u202f\u00b0C (Fig. 7(a)). The temperature is a main factor affecting the oil adsorption capacities of the sorbent materials because it changes the oil viscosity [54\u201357]. Generally, the viscosity of a material decreases with increasing temperature. However, in addition to the temperature effect, the increasing temperatures cause an NR and NRG-0.5 sorbent shrinkage owing to the elastomeric behavior. This could explain why the oil adsorption capacities of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents decreased above 45\u202f\u00b0C. As the rubber chains shrank at higher temperatures, the retention of the oil in the rubber pores decreased. This behavior was not observed for the CM sorbent owing to the different thermal properties of the NR elastomer and polypropylene plastic.\nThe effect of the waves on the oil adsorption capacities of the NR, NRG-0.5, and CM sorbents at 45\u202f\u00b0C is shown in Fig. 7(b). When the waves were introduced with a shaker, the oil adsorption capacities of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents gradually increased with increasing waves; they were 1.6 and 1.4 higher at 200\u202frpm than at 0\u202frpm, respectively. The enhanced oil adsorption capacities were due to the external force applied by the waves, which resulted in an increased oil diffusion into the sorbent matrix. By contrast, the oil adsorption capacity of CM under different waves remained essentially constant owing to the limitation of the oil diffusion along the fiber length. In addition, all sorbents continued to float on the seawater surface after the complete saturation, thereby illustrating their good buoyancies. Therefore, the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents can potentially be used as petroleum oil sorbents in real oil spill situations.\n\n\nAdsorption kinetics and isotherm studies\nIn this study, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate equations were used to study the kinetic adsorption of the sorbent materials for crude AXL oil. The results are summarized in Table 2\n. The data of all three sorbent materials approximated the pseudo-second-order model with a correlation coefficient (R2\n) of approximately 1 (0.99). In addition, the Qe,cal\n values of the three sorbent materials were approximately comparable to the experimental value (Qe,\n\nexp). The highest oil adsorption rate (k2\n) was obtained for NRG-0.5 because the presence of rGO in the composite foam increased the sorbent surface area and thereby enhanced the oil adsorption capacity. Several previous reports have reported that the adsorption of petroleum-based oil into graphene-based materials is mediated through van der Waals, electrostatic, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, and hydrophobic interactions [58]. This result suggests that the oil adsorption on a sorbent material occurs through a physicochemical process [47,59,60].\nThus, the oil diffusion mechanisms of the sorbent materials were investigated by the intraparticle diffusion model. The relationships between Qt\n and t1\/2\n of the three sorbent materials are presented in Fig. 8\n. Each curve exhibited a linear plot of at least two but, most probably, three steps. We consider them to have three steps. In the first stage, the oil diffusion from the aqueous media to the sorbent surface or \u201csurface diffusion\u201d was evident and rapid. In the second stage, both intraparticle and pore diffusion occurred. The slope of the curve decreased and reached a rate-limiting step. In the final stage, the slope of each sorbent remained approximately constant, and the adsorption approached an equilibrium. The presence of rGO in the NR sorbent resulted in the highest diffusion rate (kd\n) in all three stages and required the longest time to reach an equilibrium.\nBased on the data, the oil diffusion mechanism is proposed in Fig. 9\n. When the crude oil was adsorbed by the sorbent surface, the oil dispersed widely and diffused into the sorbent surface. Afterward, the sorbent material swelled continuously until it reached an equilibrium. However, the maximal oil adsorption capacity was obtained for the NRG-0.5 sorbent because the NR network, its porosity, and the rGO particles enhanced the adsorption capacity. By contrast, the oil diffusion of the CM sample occurred only along the fibers. Hence, the oil was adsorbed inside the fibers, which resulted in a low oil adsorption capacity.\nTo study the maximal adsorption capacities of the sorbent materials, two isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich) were applied. The results are summarized in Table 2. The adsorption isotherm of each sorbent approximated the Langmuir isotherm with a correlation coefficient (R2\n) of approximately 1 (0.99). The results imply that the adsorbed oil covered the entire cell surfaces of the materials with monolayer formations [16,47,61]. In addition, the maximal adsorption capacity (Qm\n) of the sorbent materials approximated the experimental data (Qe,\n\nexp). To clarify the adsorption preference of each sorbent material, the separation factor (RL\n) was calculated. The results are listed in Table 2. The RL\n values of the three sorbent materials varied between 0.05 and 0.12. Thus, crude AXL oil was preferred by each sorbent material. In addition, the RL\n values of the NR and NRG-0.5 sorbents were 2.4 times lower than that of CM. Thus, the crude-oil adsorption behaviors of NR and NRG-0.5 were better than that of CM [47].\n\n\nRecovery of sorbent materials\nAs well as the oil removal efficiency, the sorbent reusability is a crucial criterium in an oil spill cleanup. The reusability of sorbents minimizes the total amount of the waste generation for landfills and reduces the costs of oil spill removals. The oil recovery efficiencies of the NRG-0.5 and CM sorbents during 30 (NRG-0.5) or 15 (CM) successive adsorption\u2013desorption cycles are presented in Fig. 10\n. The oil recovery of NRG-0.5 slightly decreased in the second to fourth cycle (to approximately 82%) because of the small amount of residual oil that was trapped inside the NR foam and foam pores after the swelling. After the fifth cycle, the adsorption capacity of NRG-0.5 saturated, which implies an oil removal of more than 75% in each successive cycle. In addition, the NRG-0.5 foam exhibited no damages on the material surface, which expresses its good reusability.\nBy contrast, the oil removal ability of CM (32%) decreased remarkably after the first cycle and then slightly decreased with each subsequent reuse (up to 15 cycles) to <50%. Afterward, the surface was badly deteriorated, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Thus, no further adsorption\u2013desorption cycles were performed. This result indicates that the good reusability of NRG-0.5 originates from the good elastic properties of the NR foam and the reinforcement effect of the rGO. In conclusion, this material can be applied as oil sorbent material to remove the leakage of oil in seawater.\nThe oil adsorption capacities of various oil sorbent materials are compared in Table 3\n. Various sorbent materials can be applied for the oil recovery in water. Additionally, several researchers suggest that the addition of a filler can enhance the oil adsorption capacity of sorbent foam including the present work. However, the oil adsorption capacity of each sorbent material depends on several factors such as the hydrophobic property of the sorbent material and the oil characteristics.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, NRG composite foams were successfully prepared as petroleum oil sorbent material. The oil adsorption performances of the NRG sorbent materials depend on various factors, such as the morphology of the sorbent, rGO content, oil type, and oil properties. The high porosity of the NR foam in the presence of rGO enhances the oil adsorption capacity, which is optimal at 0.5 phr rGO (NRG-0.5). Both NR foam and NRG-0.5 composite foam are more selective for gasoline than for crude AXL oil owing to the lower viscosity of the former, which enhances the oil diffusion into the sorbent materials. The NRG-0.5 composite exhibits the highest oil adsorption capacity for gasoline (21.50\u202fg\u202fg\u22121) and crude AXL oil (17.04\u202fg\u202fg\u22121). An increasing temperature of up to 45\u202f\u00b0C or an external force (waves) increases the oil adsorption capacity of the sorbent material. The adsorption of crude AXL oil by the NR, NRG-0.5, and CM sorbents obeys the pseudo-second-order model, whereas the adsorption diffusion mechanism of the adsorption process is determined by the intraparticle diffusion model. The Langmuir isotherm is suitable for the experimental data. Thus, the crude-oil adsorption into the sorbents occurs as a mono-layer adsorption process. The high adsorption capacity of the NRG-0.5 sorbent for crude AXL oil is achieved through surface and pore diffusion through the NR network and rGO particles. By contrast, the oil diffusion mechanism of CM occurs only through fibrous diffusion. Most importantly, the high elasticity of NR and the presence of rGO in the NR composite foam improve the strength of the sorbent material. Thus, NRG-0.5 can be reused for at least 30 cycles without any damages. In conclusion, the NRG-0.5 composite foam presented in this study is a promising alternative oil sorbent for oil spill removals under critical field conditions in the ocean.\n\n","1544":"\n\nIntroduction\nIn response to the serious swine wastewater problem in China, the government has implemented environmental regulations targeting the swine industry [1]. The high concentrations of nutrients (e.g., NH4-N and P) [1,2] in swine wastewater pose a particular challenge for treatment using current technologies. The physical and chemical processes for treating wastewater containing high concentrations of nutrients are very expensive. In addition, widely used microbial processes are not suitable for such wastewater and require high energy inputs (e.g., aerobic digestion, nitrification, and denitrification) [3]. These processes can also produce substantial amounts of sludge. Accordingly, nutrient recovery from wastewater has received increasing attention in the field of wastewater treatment [4\u20136]. It has been shown that plants and microalgae are able to efficiently recover nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and heavy metals from a wide variety of wastewater types [7\u20139]. Nutrients in wastewater are absorbed and degraded by plants or microalgae and microorganisms, and are recovered as biomass at harvesting. The harvested plants and microalgae can then be utilized as value-added byproducts such as biofuels [10]. Plant and microalgal cultures are sustainable, low-cost, and do not produce sludge. In particular, bicarbonate-rich wastewater is well-suited for culturing certain algal species [11]. However, the slow nutrient removal by plants and algae can hinder the wastewater treatment process [4]. Additionally, various wastewater components are inhibitory for plant and algal growth (e.g., bicarbonate for plants and ammonia for microalgae). Zhang et al. [12] recently developed a plant-microalgal co-cultivation strategy in which plants and microalgae benefit mutually by co-utilizing nutrients in the solution, while additional mutual benefits have been further reported [13,14]. This strategy could substantially enhance the rate of nutrient removal if applied to wastewater treatment, thereby increasing the suitability of plants and microalgae for use in engineered wastewater treatment systems. However, the interactions between plants and microalgae need to be studied further under wastewater conditions.\nPathogen removal is another challenge regarding swine wastewater treatment. Multiple studies have identified Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and many other microorganisms in swine wastewater, even after it was subjected to conventional biological treatments, such as anaerobic digestion [15\u201317]. Chemical sanitizers are typically used for pathogen inactivation in water treatment, but bacteria tend to develop chemical resistance to different sanitizers [18]. The chlorination of drinking water, which represents one of the greatest achievements in public health, can lead to the unintended generation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer [19]. Alternative methods of drinking water treatment such as ozonation are expensive, while treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light is not effective against swine wastewater because the organic materials and suspended solids present in the effluent inhibit the ability of UV light to penetrate the liquid [20]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to possess antibacterial effects [21], and microalgae generate ROS during their life cycle [22,23]. If an algal species capable of releasing a large quantity of ROS is cultured in wastewater, the pathogens could be inactivated. Therefore, an ecological strategy of culturing algae in wastewater is proposed for the inactivation of pathogens in wastewater. This ecological strategy requires only organisms and sunlight, thus eliminating the use of chemicals and need for extra energy while avoiding side effects. Water scarcity is expected to become more widespread in the coming years, and eliminating wastewater discharges is critical for water preservation [24]. As one of the most cost-effective and beneficial uses for algal biomass is returning it to local land [25], ecologically-remediated wastewater could be utilized as both irrigation water and soil amendment, thus eliminating wastewater discharge. The present study aimed to develop a plant-microalgal co-culture strategy for increasing the suitability of plants and microalgae for use in engineered wastewater treatment systems.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nCulture experiments\nA batch of culture experiments was conducted in a greenhouse under ambient air conditions from September through November 2016 at the Zhejiang University Experimental Farm, Hangzhou, China. Natural light conditions were maintained in the greenhouse throughout the entire culture period, the temperature was controlled with respective daily minimum and maximum values of 20.2\u202f\u00b0C and 36.5\u202f\u00b0C, and the average daily relative humidity (RH) ranged from 36.7% to 85.2%. The swine wastewater used in this study was anaerobically digested effluent from a local swine farm in Tonglu County, Hangzhou, China. The wastewater was diluted (1:3) with water for use in the culture experiments. Three treatments were conducted in this study: a plant culture (PC), an algal culture (AC), and a plant-algae co-culture (PACC). A completely randomized experimental design with three replicates was used. The culture containers consisted of 23\u202fL transparent plastic bottles filled with 21\u202fL of working solution.\nThe green alga Dictyosphaerium sp. that was used in the cultures was isolated from wastewater originating from an experimental farm at Zhejiang University and then cultured in BG11 medium [11]. Microalgal seeds were added to the AC and PACC wastewater, and the initial optical density (OD) values were adjusted to an absorbance of 0.05\u20130.07 at a wavelength of 680\u202fnm (OD680).\n\nVetiveria zizanioides plants were obtained from a local farm in Hangzhou, China. The plants that were used in the PC and PACC treatments were fixed to the bottle mouth with a sponge strip. The average plant height when installing the treatments was 191.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.8\u202fcm (n\u202f=\u202f6), and the average root length was 41.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.6\u202fcm (n\u202f=\u202f6).\nTo validate the relationship between water ROS and algal biomass, a batch of algal culture experiments was conducted as described by Cheng et al. [11]. On day 13 during the exponential growth stage, samples from each medium were collected to measure the algal biomass and the ROS concentration. The algal biomass in each medium was also determined as described by Cheng et al. [11]. The samples from each medium were first centrifuged at 7000\u202frpm for 2\u202fmin, after which the collected supernatant was filtered through a 0.45\u202f\u03bcm cellulose membrane. The supernatant was then used to determine the ROS content of the water, based on the method of Xiao et al. [26].\n\n\nWastewater properties\nMeasurements of hydrogen ion concentration (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), and dissolved oxygen (DO) were taken daily between 12:00\u202fpm and 12:30\u202fpm with a PHB-4 pH meter (INESA CO., Shanghai, China), a DDB-303A EC meter (INESA CO., Shanghai, China), and a JPB-607A dissolved oxygen meter (INESA CO., Shanghai, China), respectively. Furthermore, samples from the wastewater were analyzed for bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212), NH4-N, PO4-P, and ROS concentrations. Each wastewater sample was centrifuged at 7000\u202frpm for 2\u202fmin, after which the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45\u202f\u03bcm cellulose membrane. The filtrate was then analyzed for HCO3\n\u2212 (using the methods described by Kozaki et al. [27]) via ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS-1500 Ion Chromatography System with an IonPac AS11-HC 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202fmm column (SpectraLab Scientific Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada); NH4-N (Nash-reagent spectrophotometric method); NO3-N (phenoldisulfonic acid method); and PO4-P (molybdenum\u2013antimony anti-spectrophotometric method). Furthermore, wastewater ROS were determined according to the method described by Xiao et al. [26].\n\n\nAlgal growth\nAlgal cell growth in the solutions was determined by measuring the OD680 on selected dates with a spectrophotometer (722S, Leng Guang Tech., Shanghai, China). The algal dry mass was subsequently estimated from the fitted relationship between OD680 and algal dry weight biomass. The algal growth rate was calculated as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\n\u03bc\n=\nln\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n2\n\n\/\n\nx\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n2\n\n-\n\nt\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere x1\n and x2\n denote the absorbance values at time intervals t1\n and t2\n, respectively, and \u03bc represents the specific growth rate.\nAlgal biomasses harvested on culture day 9 and day 15 were oven-dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C, and the dried samples were milled and passed through a 0.425\u202fmm sieve. Carbon (C) and N contents were then determined using a Flash EA 1112 analyzer (ThermoFinnigan Italia, Milan, Italy).\n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing\nOn culture days 0, 9, and 15, 100\u202fmL wastewater sample was collected from the PACC and submitted for bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplification and sequencing. The analysis was performed at the Beijing Nuo He Zhi Yuan Science and Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was performed using the universal primers 515F 50-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-30 and 806R 50-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-30. All of the PCR products were sequenced using an Illumina Miseq Sequencing platform following standard protocols. High-quality sequences were assigned to samples based on barcodes. Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered with a 97% similarity cutoff using Usearch (http:\/\/www.drive5.com\/usearch\/).\nTaxonomic classifications were assigned to OTUs with a Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier (http:\/\/rdp.cme.msu.edu\/) and confidence threshold of 80%, as well as the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with an output of >90% sequence identity over 90% coverage.\n\n\nPlant growth\nPlant fresh weight was determined after transplanting on culture day 15 and at the end of the culture period. At the end of the culture period, plants were divided into root and shoot parts, oven-dried at 70\u202f\u00b0C to a consistent weight, and then weighed to determine the dry mass. The plant growth rate was calculated as:\n\n(2)\n\n\nVp\n=\n\n(\n\nMp\n2\n\n-\n\nMp\n1\n\n)\n\n\/\n\n(\n\nt\n2\n\n-\n\nt\n1\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n\nwhere Mp1\n and Mp2\n denote plant fresh biomass (g) at time (d) intervals t1\n and t2, respectively, and Vp (g\u202fFW\u00b7d\u22121) represents the growth rate.\n\n\nRoot respiration rate\nRespiration rates were measured on 0.5\u202fg of fresh roots using a portable infrared gas analyzer (LI-COR 6400, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The root respiration rate was expressed as \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7kg FW\u22121\u00b7s\u22121.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nMeans and standard deviations of the dataset were calculated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA). The student\u2019s t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey\u2019s tests) were conducted using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to compare the two means and the three means of the measured variables, respectively. Statistically significant results were determined at the 0.05 confidence level (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).\n\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nWastewater properties\nThe wastewater contained high concentrations of bicarbonate and nitrogen as well as low to medium levels of other essential nutrients including P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) (Table 1\n). While nitrogen and other nutrients are suitable for culturing both plants and microalgae, the bicarbonate required for algal growth could be stressful to plants as excessive amounts inhibit plant growth and stimulate physiological processes [28,29]. The salinity (EC\u202f=\u202f4.89 mS\/cm) of the wastewater was too high for use in irrigation as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the total dissolved solids (TDS) in irrigation water should not exceed a value of 450\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121, corresponding to an EC value of 0.95\u202fmS\/cm.\nThirty-five dominant genera of bacteria with OTUs ranging from 0 to 5138 were detected in the wastewater, and the pathogenic bacteria Clostridium spp.\n[30] and Arcobacter spp. [31] were dominant in the original wastewater and on day 9 in the PACC, respectively (Table 2\n). Other pathogens, including Escherichia spp., Chryseobacterium spp.\n[32], and Pseudomonas spp.\n[33], were also abundant in the wastewater (Table 2). The dominant pathogens detected in this study were different from those identified in previous studies [15\u201317].\nSwine wastewater containing pathogens and high levels of ammonia and salts can cause substantial soil salinization, and soil and groundwater pollution. Therefore, this wastewater is not suitable for use as irrigation water.\n\n\nValidation of the relationship between algal biomass and water ROS level\nAs shown in Fig. 1\n, there was a significant (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) positive correlation between the algal biomass and water ROS level. Furthermore, the water ROS level was zero when no algae were present in the medium. These results confirm that the water ROS were produced by the algae.\nThe water ROS concentration was high (>90\u202fnmol\u00b7mL\u22121) in both the AC and PACC but the concentration did not differ significantly (P\u202f>\u202f0.05) between the two treatments (Fig. 2\n). These results indicate that Dictyosphaerium sp. is capable of releasing large quantities of ROS.\n\n\nPlant growth\nThe plant growth rate in the PACC treatment on day 15 of the culture period was 12.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2 (n\u202f=\u202f3) g FW\u00b7d\u22121, which is significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) higher than what was measured in the PC treatment (1.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fg FW\u00b7d\u22121, n\u202f=\u202f3). In addition, the root dry weight at the end of the culture period was 33.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.6 (n\u202f=\u202f3) g\u00b7plant\u22121 and 57.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.5 (n\u202f=\u202f3) g\u00b7plant\u22121 in the PC and PACC treatments, respectively. In summary, plant growth rates were inhibited in the PC culture, but were rather high for the PACC plants.\nThroughout the culture period, the water DO in the PC treatment was approximately 0\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121, which could be the result of oxygen being depleted from the anaerobic wastewater by root respiration. In contrast, the DO in the water of the AC and PACC treatments was supersaturated (>10\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121) after day 3 of the experiment (Fig. 3\n) due to oxygen generation by algal photosynthesis [12,13]. Consistently, the root respiration rates on day 9 were 8.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2 (n\u202f=\u202f3) \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7kg FW\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 and 30.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2 (n\u202f=\u202f3) \u03bcmol CO2\u00b7kg FW\u22121\u00b7s\u22121 in the PC and PACC treatments, respectively. Therefore, hypoxic stress could be an important factor leading to slow plant growth in the AC.\nAs shown in Fig. 4\n, the wastewater bicarbonate concentration in the PC remained nearly unchanged throughout the experiment but decreased rapidly in the AC and PACC since Dictyosphaerium sp. is capable of depleting bicarbonate quickly [11]. The water bicarbonate was more rapidly depleted in the AC as compared to the PACC, which is likely because of a greater carbon dioxide (CO2) supply generated from root respiration in the PACC [12]. The high bicarbonate concentration in the PC could inhibit plant growth as bicarbonate can induce or aggravate Fe deficiency [28] and Zn deficiency [29], while the depletion of bicarbonate by algae in the PACC could alleviate bicarbonate stress on plant growth.\nAdditionally, microalgae are able to produce and excrete hormones (auxins and cytokinins) [34,35] and biostimulants [13,14] into the growing substrate, which could also enhance plant growth.\n\n\nMicroalgal growth\nAfter day 3, the algal biomass was significantly higher in the PACC than in the AC (Fig. 5\n). Consequently, the relative growth rate was also significantly higher in the PACC (0.168\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.009, n\u202f=\u202f3) than in the AC (0.151\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.007, n\u202f=\u202f3).\nThe initial NH4-N concentration was above 100\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121, which can inhibit algal growth. The inhibitory effects of NH4-N on microalgae have been widely reported in digestate treatment [36] where growth inhibition has been observed at NH4-N\u202f>\u202f100\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 due to the presence of free ammonia [37]. To alleviate ammonia toxicity, Praveen et al. [37] developed a culture strategy where nitrification is applied as a pretreatment. Ammonia toxicity is closely related to the pH of the medium as free ammonia increases with pH. Microalgae growth is usually associated with an increase in medium pH, which often leads to higher ammonia concentrations and enhanced toxicity [38].\nInterestingly, the CO2 from root respiration significantly acidified the wastewater. The water pH tended to decrease with culture time and fell below 6.2 on day 15 in both the PC and PACC (Fig. 6\n). In the PACC, the increase in pH from day 0 to day 3 likely occurred because during this early stage, the amount of CO2 derived from root respiration was less than that depleted by algal photosynthesis. In contrast, the water pH in the AC increased with culture time, reaching 8.92 on day 15 (Fig. 6), which is in agreement with previous studies [38]. The wastewater pH in the PACC was 0.15 and 2.68 units lower than in the AC on day 3 and day 15, respectively. The acidic pH could result in the hydrogenation and solubilization of ammonia [37], thus alleviating the ammonia toxicity for the microalgae in the PACC. Ammonia toxicity can also be alleviated through the uptake of NH4-N by plants. Therefore, the plants in the PACC could significantly reduce ammonia toxicity that inhibits algal growth.\nThe DO was consistently lower in the PACC than in the AC (Fig. 3), which is attributed to the consumption of oxygen by plant root respiration in the PACC. Since dissolved oxygen supersaturation in enclosed photoreactors can be as high as 400% [39], oxygen consumption by root respiration could enhance algal photosynthesis in the PACC by removing the inhibitory effects of oxygen.\nThe algal C content was significantly lower in the AC than in the PACC. In contrast, the algal nitrogen content was significantly higher in the AC than in the PACC (Fig. 7\n). Most likely, root respiration in the PACC increased the available carbon for algal growth while the competition for nitrogen by plants reduced the available nitrogen for algal growth. Carbon deficiency is an important limiting factor in algal cultures [11,12]. Therefore, the increased availability of carbon from root respiration could enhance algal growth in the PACC.\n\n\nBacterial community shift\nInterestingly, the OTUs for 31 of the bacterial genera that were detected in the wastewater tended to decrease with culture time in the PACC, while the OTUs of three phototrophic bacteria and one rhizobacteria increased with culture time (Table 2). In particular, the OTUs of Methanosaeta, Escherichia, Paenibacillus, Rhodococcus, Ralstonia, and Citrobacter decreased to zero or near zero, indicating that they were completely removed by the PACC on day 9 or day 15. Importantly, Erythromicrobium belonging to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria [40], became most dominant on day 15, which could be attributed to the light and oxygen conditions being more favorable for this bacterium in the PACC. When compared to the original wastewater, the OTUs for all of the pathogens became significantly (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) lower in the PACC on day 15. In particular, Escherichia spp. was completely removed from the PACC on day 9. Consequently, the bacterial community in the PACC shifted from being pathogen-dominant as in the original wastewater on day 9, to being photobacteria-dominant on day 15. These results indicate that pathogens could be effectively inactivated in the PACC. Interactions between plants and bacteria and between autotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria can be cooperative or competitive [41]. Plant and microalgal exudates could serve as an endogenous source of growth substrates for bacteria [42]. However, plant and algal growth could also inhibit bacterial activity by releasing toxic metabolites and maintaining high oxygen levels through algal photosynthesis [43]. In this study, with the exception of the phototrophic bacteria and rhizobacteria, all of the bacteria were inactivated in the PACC. This is likely attributed to the large quantity of ROS released by Dictyosphaerium sp. (Fig. 2) and the supersaturation of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 3) in the PACC.\n\n\nNutrient removal\nChanging water NH4-N and phosphorus concentrations with culture time in each treatment are presented in Figs. 8 and 9\n\n, respectively. The relationship between the water nutrients and culture time is best described using a linear or exponential equation (Table 3\n). The amount of time needed for NH4-N to decrease to 5\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 in the PC, AC, and PACC was calculated at 65.5\u202fdays, 34.2\u202fdays, and 13.3\u202fdays, respectively, while the amount of time needed for phosphorus to decrease to 2\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 was 82.7\u202fdays, 25.5\u202fdays, and 11.6\u202fdays, respectively. These results indicate that the removal of NH4-N and phosphorus was very rapid in the PACC relative to the AC or PC. As shown in Fig. 10\n, since day 9, the water EC was consistently and significantly lower in the PACC relative to the AC and PC, and decreased from an initial value of 1.63\u202fmS\u00b7cm\u22121 to 0.82\u202fmS\u00b7cm\u22121 at the end of the culture period. The rapid removal of nutrients in the PACC is promising because 30\u202fdays and 40\u202fdays were required respectively for NH4-N to decrease from 137\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 to 5\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 and for phosphorus to decrease from 25\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 to 5\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121 in an optimized microalgae-based membrane photobioreactor (MPBR) [37]. These results demonstrate that the PACC could be used in engineered wastewater treatment systems. The improved nutrient removal efficiency in the PACC is mainly attributed to the enhanced growth and nutrient uptake of both plants and microalgae since there was poor growth of plants in the PC and of microalgae in the AC. In the PACC, both plants and microalgae grew rapidly, allowing of the rapid uptake of essential nutrients (e.g., C, N, P, sulfur (S), K, and Fe) [12,44]. The continuous oxygen supply by the microalgae could influence the activity and metabolism of microorganism, and thus enhance nutrient removal in the PACC as Chen et al. [45] reported that increasing the aeration rate or moderately lengthening the aeration time could achieve good removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus in treating the wastewater. Particularly, the growth of the phototrophic bacterium (see Table 2) could enhance nutrient removal since phototrophic bacteria require nutrients (e.g., N and P) for growth [46].\nThe only inputs required for the PACC treatment were the organisms and solar energy (i.e., sunlight). The use of transparent containers made sunlight available to both the plants and microalgae. Since the multispecies interactions occurred continuously throughout the entire culture, little maintenance was required to operate this system. Furthermore, the simple infrastructure and operation make the PACC system suitable for local wastewater treatment, which is in agreement with the \u2018decentralized recovery\u2019 strategy [47]. Irrigation that leads to soil salinity, chemical pollution, and pathogen loading is problematic and precludes wastewater reuse. The PACC-treated wastewater that attained low salinity, chemical pollution, and pathogen risk could be suitable for irrigation. In addition, the PACC system would allow for plants and microalgae to be produced at an extremely low cost. In this study, both the plants and microalgae that were used are marketable. Vetiver plants can be used as animal feed, feedstock for the refinement of essential oils and plants for water conservation engineering, whereas the high protein green algae can be used as bio-fertilizers and animal feed.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nA vetiver and Dictyosphaerium sp. co-culture was developed for the rapid removal of nutrients and ecological inactivation of pathogens in swine wastewater. The most dominant pathogens in the wastewater were Clostridium spp. and Arcobacter spp., and the bacterial community shifted from pathogen-dominant in the original wastewater to photobacteria-dominant on day 15 of the culture period. In 15\u202fdays, the PACC decreased NH4-N and phosphorus levels below acceptable limits, significantly decreased the salinity, and inactivated pathogens in the wastewater. Additional important interactions between plants and microalgae (e.g., water acidification and alleviation of ammonia toxicity by root respiration, and alleviation of bicarbonate stress by microalgae) were also identified in the PACC.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1545":"\n\nIntroduction\nMangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) is an endemic evergreen tree species grown in tropical countries, such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia [1,2]. Mangosteen belongs to the Clusiaceae (Guttiferae) family [3,4] and is widely cultivated for its fruit, which is commonly termed the \u201cQueen of Fruits\u201d because of its unique sweet\u2013sour taste [1,5]. Harvest of this fruit results in a major economic impact with nearly 700,000 tons produced worldwide in 2017 [6]. The fruit contains bioactive compounds, such as xanthones (Fig. 1\na\u2013g) and anthocyanins (Fig. 1h\u2013i), which are mainly extracted from the fruit pericarp. Additionally, it possesses high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Mangosteen has been used to treat various diseases, including tumors, diabetes, bacterial infections, hypertension, and arthritis [1,7]. These applications suggest the usefulness of the fruit extract in medicinal and pharmaceutical contexts.\nXanthones are the main metabolites that contribute to the pharmaceutical applications of mangosteen extract. At least 70 xanthones have been characterized to date [1,8]. The xanthone structure is mainly composed of three consecutive aromatic rings differentiated by side chains (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, modifying these side chains is known to influence xanthone bioactivity [9,10]. Some of the major xanthones isolated from mangosteen fruit are \u03b1-mangostin (Fig. 1b), \u03b2-mangostin (Fig. 1c), \u03b3-mangostin (Fig. 1d), gartanin (Fig. 1e), 8-deoxygartanin (Fig. 1f), and garcinone E (Fig. 1g). Other compounds, including anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-3-sophoroside (Fig. 1h) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (Fig. 1i) can also be abundantly found in the fruit pericarp [1].\nPreviously, several reviews have comprehensively addressed the fruit\u2019s medicinal properties [1,8,11], such as anticarcinogenic [12\u201316], antibiofilm [17], antioxidant [18], antiperiodontitic [19], and antidiabetic [20] properties. Additionally, properties such as amelioration of metabolic disorders [7] and regulation of melanogenesis [21] have also been reported. Furthermore, other reviews have discussed the fruit extract\u2019s potential in waste utilization [22] as well as from the perspective of somatic embryogenesis [23]. However, no critical evaluation of the various properties and utilization of the fruit in other scientific fields, such as postharvest biology, food science, and engineering and materials science, has been conducted.\nIn this review, the properties and applicability of mangosteen in various fields are presented in detail (Fig. 2\n). Only publications from 2016 onward were considered using the keywords of \u201cmangosteen AND Garcinia mangostana\u201d searched in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO and Google Scholar databases. Furthermore, only full-text publications were considered, any short proceedings and transactions were excluded from this review, to be selective and nonredundant in the analysis.\n\n\nPostharvest biology\nMangosteen has been investigated in various aspects of postharvest biology, including determining the phytohormone roles in increasing fruit shelf life, metabolite profiling, identifying bioactive compounds from different tissues, identifying contaminants from the fruit and related products, and managing pests and diseases.\n\nRoles of phytohormones\nMangosteen is known to be a climacteric fruit that relies on hormones, such as ethylene, to ripen. Various recent studies have investigated strategies to increase the shelf life of mangosteen. For example, Vo et al. [24] showed that storing mangosteen fruit at stage 3 (full red fruit) in a low-density polyethylene bag with a 1-methylcyclopropene sachet (ethylene perception inhibitor) can prolong the ripening period and inhibit the development of fruit rot disease, thereby increasing the fruit shelf life. Another postharvest study by Mustafa et al. [25] described the use of two stress phytohormones methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA), in delaying mangosteen pericarp hardening. The hardening of the fruit shell is often attributed to the lignification of the tissues as a response to injury. Applying MeJA and SA reduced the fruit hardness up to 12\u202fdays after harvest, suggesting the applicability of these hormones in fruit preservation [25]. Additionally, a microperforated polypropylene film bag containing holes for aeration was shown to be effective in maintaining mangosteen fruit quality over a 25-day storage period [26]. This finding suggests that controlling phytohormones released by the fruit is critical in postharvest mangosteen preservation.\n\n\nMetabolite profiling\nThe postharvest characteristics of mangosteen ripening have been investigated in different fruit tissues using various analytical techniques, including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolites related to the cell wall, such as galacturonic acid and xylose, increased during the ripening process, implying an active cell wall breakdown [27]. Psicose was also identified in the pericarp tissue, and the metabolite was suggested to play a role in protecting the fruit from excessive dehydration [27]. Other metabolites, including sugars (fructose and glucose) and amino acids (tryptophan, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and serine), also increased during ripening in various mangosteen tissues (either pericarp, aril, or seeds), suggesting concerted metabolic activities during the process [27]. Other reports have also demonstrated that carbohydrates and simple sugars were abundantly present in the fruit pericarp [28,29].\nOther metabolomic techniques, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to further identify the compounds present in mangosteen fruit. For instance, using a high-accuracy liquid chromatography- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry system, Qin et al. [30] found that the composition of procyanidins in mangosteen consists of 47.7% monomers, 24.1% dimers, and 26.0% trimers, which may contribute to the high antioxidant activity of the fruit pericarp. Moreover, the levels of xanthone compounds in fruits harvested from various locations may vary. Using HPLC analysis, Muchtaridi et al. [31]; Muchtaridi et al. [32]; and Muchtaridi et al. [15] found that the levels of \u03b1-mangostin, \u03b3-mangostin, and gartanin in the fruit pericarp differed among the fruits harvested from four different Indonesian districts. This result is interesting as fruits from different origins may show different metabolic profiles. Furthermore, using a new technique termed droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probing, several xanthones, such as \u03b1-mangostin, \u03b2-mangostin, \u03b3-mangostin, and gartanin, were identified from the dried fruit and leaf of mangosteen deposited in a herbarium [33]. Such a technique utilizes ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a high-resolution mass spectrometry (Thermo ScientificTM Q ExactiveTM Plus) for molecular mass determination and is able to preserve the sample integrity after the analysis [33].\n\n\nBioactive compounds from various tissues\nVarious mangosteen tissues, including pericarp, seeds, leaves, and plantlets, are known to contain bioactive compounds, such as phenolics and flavonoids. For instance, the G. mangostana pericarp showed significantly higher (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) total phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content than that of other colored plant samples, such as Syzygium cumini (Java plum) fruit, Clitoria ternatea (butterfly pea) flower, and Ardisia colorata var. elliptica (chicken\u2019s eye) fruit [34]. The antioxidant capacity of mangosteen peel extract was the highest among that of other studied samples. This result may be attributed to the high concentration of various flavonoid and phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, epicatechin, rutin, catechin, and cyanidin-3-sophoroside [34].\nMangosteen seeds contain an increasing level of flavonoids and xanthones during development and germination phases, perhaps as a defensive strategy during these processes to protect seed viability [35,36]. In callus originated from young mangosteen leaves, several secondary metabolites, such as thiacremonone (a sulfur compound) and 7-methylthioheptanaldoxime (glucosinolate), were putatively identified upon elicitation using MeJA, a stress response hormone [37]. Moreover, under water deficit stress, mangosteen plantlets showed modulated secondary metabolite levels, including those of fatty acids (propyl oleate and hexadecenoic acid) and a terpenoid (neophytadiene), perhaps as a defense mechanism during drought stress [38]. This finding suggests that various tissues from mangosteen produce bioactive compounds, particularly in response to stress.\n\n\nOptimization of isolation methods\nPolyphenolic compounds, such as xanthones and flavonoids, are often most soluble in organic solvents and require nonpolar solvents for extraction and dissolution. Ghasemzadeh et al. [39] utilized an optimized microwave-assisted protocol for \u03b1-mangostin extraction using ethyl acetate as a solvent. They found high levels of extracted \u03b1-mangostin with high antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Similarly, the microwave-assisted approach and ultrasound technique have been optimized to extract flavonoids and anthocyanins from mangosteen, respectively [40,41]. Furthermore, Saputri [42] optimized a solid phase extraction (SPE) technique for \u03b1-mangostin extraction using ethanol as an eluent for an SPE cartridge octadecylsilane-5 filter. In addition, several xanthones, such as \u03b1-mangostin, \u03b2-mangostin, gartanin, 3-isomangostin, garcinone E, mangostanol, 8-desoxygartanin, and 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone, were extracted from mangosteen pericarp tissue using liquified dimethyl ether extraction [43]. However, most semipolar or nonpolar solvents such as acetone and dichloromethane, which are commonly used to extract mangosteen [44], are hazardous substances for human consumption and topical application. Therefore, the use of water-based extraction is desirable for wider biocompatibility. One unique property of water is that it can be boiled past its boiling temperature but retain its liquid form under a high-pressure condition, a state termed as subcritical water. This process allows nonpolar compounds to be dissolved, and this also has been performed for mangosteen xanthone extraction [45].\nAnother research study completed by Tan et al. [46] and Ng et al. [47] showed that a mild thermo-induced aqueous micellar biphasic system can be used to recover \u03b1- and \u03b3-mangostin from mangosteen peel. This technique allows effective xanthone extraction without employing large volume of chemicals and sophisticated instruments, as is commonly used in chromatographic solvent extraction and supercritical fluid extraction, respectively [46,47]. This technique offers a quicker alternative to isolate valuable xanthones from the fruit and is a much greener approach. Furthermore, total phenolic content can be effectively extracted from mangosteen pericarp using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) combined with hydrothermal extraction, as shown by Chhouk et al. [48].\n\n\nIdentification of chemical contaminants\nMangosteen postharvest research also focuses on contaminant identification. Phopin et al. [49] discovered that mangosteen fruit harvested from various farms in Thailand contained various pesticides, of which carbofuran, chlorothalonil, dimethoate, and metalaxyl exceeded the recommended maximum residue limit. However, these chemicals can be removed with running water (10\u202fmin soaking in water followed by gentle rubbing), and they were not present at a high concentration within the aril of the fruit [49], making the fruit safe for consumption. Siriangkhawut et al. [50] showed that mangosteen peel powder did not contain any heavy metals, including Cd and Pb, using ultrasound-assisted digestion coupled with flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Such analysis is important, as several other herbal products contain these heavy metals, which may affect consumers\u2019 health [50]. However, one unnamed herbal product based on mangosteen was found to exceed the limit of allowable Cd content (0.42\u202fmg\/kg) in the Philippines, suggesting that a thorough examination of such a product is imperative before human consumption [51].\n\n\nManagement of pests and fruit disorders\nThe management of pests and fruiting\/flowering period are important aspects of mangosteen fruit industry. Insects, such as mealybugs (Exallomochlus hispidus), are a major threat to mangosteen production and export. This insect excretes sweet exudates on the fruit surface, promoting mold growth while reducing fruit quality [52,53]. This insect has caused great losses in the mangosteen industry, and as such, Indarwatmi et al. [54] developed a phytosanitary technique using 60Co gamma irradiation at 250\u202fGy to inhibit the reproduction of the bugs while maintaining fruit quality. Another study by Tavera et al. [55] showed that, upon elicitation with Aspidiotus rigidus, a scale insect, mangosteen leaves emitted a high level of a particular terpene, kaur-16-ene. This volatile compound is a precursor to the phytohormone gibberellin. This finding indicated that when stressed, mangosteen tissues enhance growth-related processes to potentially compensate for the damage caused by such insects [55]. In another study, Ounlert et al. [56] built a mathematical model to predict the mangosteen flowering date by incorporating various factors, such as dry and rainy days, humidity, and temperature, in Thailand. Such a model is useful for the effective management of mangosteen orchards, particularly when deciding upon the optimal pesticide use and harvesting resources.\nThe two main problems for mangosteen growers and exporters are yellow sap contamination and translucent flesh disorder. The former is an abundance of yellow sap within the fruit pericarp and aril, reducing its appeal and leading to a bitter taste [57,58]. A recent study showed that this issue can be overcome by supplementing mangosteen trees with sufficient Ca nutrients and ensuring adequate sunlight during the fruiting period [57,58]. Translucent flesh disorder is characterized by translucent aril with crispy texture [59]. This disorder is a result of lignification upon hypoxic condition resulting from capillary water [59]. This disorder affects more fruit during the rainy season, particularly if it coincides with fruit developmental phase. Nakawajana et al. [60] developed a system based on electrical impedance spectroscopy to detect mangosteen fruit with translucent flesh disorder. This exemplifies that new advancements in technology are beneficial in characterizing postharvest symptoms.\n\n\n\nFood science\nMangosteen research can also be found in food science. A number of reported studies have investigated its usage in food and functional food products, animal feed supplementation, and determination of food shelf life (Fig. 2).\n\nFood and functional food products\nMangosteen fruit\u2019s unique sweet-sour taste has resulted in various usages in food products (Fig. 2). For instance, various humectants, such as maltitol, glycerol, and maltodextrin, have been investigated for optimal water content for mangosteen aril preservation [61]. The last compound (maltodextrin) showed better textural integrity and quality of the dried aril than other tested humectants [61]. Furthermore, the addition of mangosteen rind juice as a natural colorant into a sugar palm fruit jam named \u201cKolang-kaling\u201d improved its red color, texture, and flavor, as preferred by trained panelists [62]. The jam-mangosteen mixture also had high moisture content, water activity, total dissolved solids, and crude fiber, suggesting that the fruit juice addition enhanced various organoleptic and chemical characteristics of the jam [62]. Interestingly, the color of the mangosteen-added jam may be due to anthocyanins other than malvidin 3,5-diglucoside chloride, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside chloride, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside chloride, as these anthocyanins were not detected in the HPLC analysis performed by Yenrina et al. [63]. Nonetheless, a mangosteen peel extract drink contained higher anthocyanin and antioxidant levels when added to 1% gelatin [64]. This result suggests that mangosteen extract added to gelatin can serve as a valuable functional drink. Furthermore, volatiles, such as (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, hexan-1-ol, and hexanal, were found to be the main contributors to the mangosteen fruit juice\u2019s distinctive smell [65]. This smell will also determine consumers\u2019 perception and acceptance of the product.\nOther functional foods that have been fortified with mangosteen fruit extract are yogurt, ice cream, chocolate, and lozenges. A study performed by Shori et al. [66] indicated that the addition of mangosteen pulp and pericarp extracts into the Phytomix-3 mixture (containing a mixture of Lycium barbarum, Momordica grosvenori, and Psidium guajava leaves) increased the total phenolic compounds (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) of the resulting yogurt. Consequently, this increased the antioxidant activity of the yogurt by approximately 37\u201343% during 14\u202fdays of storage. A sensory evaluation test by consumers also showed high preference (particularly in regard to sweetness and aroma) toward the yogurt with the added mangosteen extract [66]. This observation suggests that the addition of mangosteen mix increases not only the levels of some chemical constituents in the yogurt but also its appeal to consumers. In addition, Hiranrangsee et al. [41] used mangosteen fruit puree and extracted anthocyanin to supplement ice cream. The study further showed that the anthocyanin content (up to 2% w\/w) increased the antioxidant level of the ice cream. Furthermore, mangosteen pericarp extract has been used in chocolate production [67] and lozenges [68], suggesting the applicability of mangosteen extract in various types of food fortification.\n\n\nAnimal feed supplementation\nMangosteen has also been used as animal feed. For example, mangosteen peel powder has been used as feed supplementation for dairy steer and lactating cows without an adverse impact on the livestock\u2019s diets [69,70]. Such supplementation improved various aspects of the steers\u2019 digestion, microbiome composition, and rumen fermentation [69,70]. Furthermore, Hidanah et al. [71] reported that mangosteen peel addition into broiler chicken feed can increase the chickens\u2019 weight during heat stress. Such observations may be attributed to the bioactive components of mangosteen peel, such as xanthones, that may improve chicken tolerance during stress [71]. Furthermore, mangosteen waste branches have been converted to pyroligneous acid via carbonization [72]. This compound exhibits high phenolic and antioxidant levels and can be used as an animal feed supplement [72]. However, further investigation, particularly at the molecular level, should be performed to investigate the regulatory role played by mangosteen compounds in promoting the general health of poultry and livestock.\n\n\nMeasuring and prolonging food shelf life\nMangosteen compound has been used in measuring and prolonging food shelf life. For instance, a biofilm coated with anthocyanin extract from mangosteen was also able to detect spoilage of chicken nuggets via color indication [73]. Meanwhile, cyanidin-3-sophoroside, a major anthocyanin from the fruit rind, has been shown to act as an anti-browning agent for apple cuts [74]. The compound action was elucidated as a potent allosteric inhibitor of polyphenol oxidase, an enzyme responsible for melanin (brown pigment) generation [74]. Undeniably, this finding further expands the use of mangosteen in various food industries and applications.\n\n\n\nEngineering and material sciences\nMangosteen has several applications in the field of engineering and materials science. For instance, different parts of the plants have been exploited and converted into valuable components of fabric and solar cells, carbon dots (C-dots), activated carbons (ACs), and biomedical advanced materials (Fig. 2).\n\nNatural dye for fabric and solar cells\nOne of the most native uses of mangosteen in this field is perhaps as a natural dye due to its prominent color. Fully ripened mangosteen pericarp contains anthocyanins, such as cyanidin-3-sophoroside and cyanidin-3-glucoside (Fig. 1h-i), which contribute to the dark purple\/red color of its pericarp [75\u201377]. Other compounds, such as tannin, can also be extracted from mangosteen for another (brown) coloring property [78]. The use of these natural dyes in the textile industry shows great potential, as they can be inexpensively obtained (such as from the fruit pericarp waste) and are safe for the environment (biodegradable and nontoxic) compared with synthetic dyes, such as Ru complexes. For instance, Kusumawati et al. [78] successfully dyed cotton fabrics using mangosteen extract. Interestingly, the use of fixing chemicals, such as iron sulfate, alum, and lime, along with the extract generated different fabric colors, namely, green, light brown, and dark brown, respectively. Meanwhile, Faiz et al. [79] showed that vitamin C treatment improves the color retention of silk fabric dyed with mangosteen husk. These studies exemplify that mangosteen waste extract can be applied to the fabric industry as an inexpensive natural dye.\nMangosteen dark purple dye is also valuable for creating dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A DSSC is composed of a nanocrystalline porous semiconductor electrode, an auxiliary electrode, and an electrolyte. A DSSC is considered a third-generation solar cell, particularly used for light energy harvesting to generate electricity (Fig. 3\n). Among the main processes in DSSC operation is absorption that regulates cell efficiency. Such a process requires the use of potent dyes coated on the surface of the electrode to absorb considerable light energy. Natural dyes are preferred for DSSC fabrication due to their low cost and easy fabrication and purification [80].\nEvidently, fabricated DSSCs using crude mangosteen extract showed a maximum light to-current conversion efficiency (\u03b7) of 0.97% [81]. The natural dyes that contain anthocyanin have the highest \u03b7 as they can efficiently assist the electron mobility of the metal oxide semiconductor. This function is due to the existing active carbonyl (CO) and hydroxyl (OH) groups in the anthocyanin structure. Tontapha et al. [80] successfully fabricated a DSSC using \u03b1-mangostin and anthocyanin extracted with different solvents, such as acidified acetone and ethanol. Another study using a lithium bis(oxalato)borate-based electrolyte showed that the efficiency of a DSSC sensitized with mangosteen dye extract was higher than those sensitized with other natural dyes, such as extracts of blueberry, spinach, and red cabbage [82]. Furthermore, DSSCs fabricated using biocapped zinc oxide nanoparticles and mangosteen dye as sensitizers resulted in a high cell efficiency [83]. These lines of evidence suggest that mangosteen extract has been fabricated in various manners to generate a highly efficient DSSC, which can potentially be used in future solar cells.\n\n\nC-dots for bioimaging\nAnother emerging field for mangosteen application is the generation of C-dots for biosensory analysis. C-dots are a new class of carbon nanospheres that are smaller than 10\u202fnm in size and have fascinating luminescent properties, high stability, and chemical inertness [84]. Furthermore, C-dots possess super solubility in water, biocompatibility, optical properties, and low cytotoxicity [84]. Currently, C-dots are being used in various applications, such as optoelectronic devices, photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and bioimaging [84]. C-dots can be synthesized from natural carbon sources, including mangosteen fruit.\nIn a recent study, mangosteen pulp was successfully synthesized into C-dots using a simple calcined method, eliminating the need for harmful chemicals [85]. Mangosteen C-dots showed excellent potential in analyzing Fe3+ ions within a linear range from 0 to 0.18\u202fmM. This excellent potential is due to the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the C-dot surface that form a high-affinity binding and rapid chelation with Fe3+. Furthermore, the synthesized C-dots show an outstanding fluorescent temperature probe toward reversible and restorable properties during temperature change. These fluorescent C-dots can be preferentially used for bioimaging as shown by their biocompatibility with yeast cells [85] (Fig. 4\n).\nAnother important C-dot study using pyrolyzed mangosteen peel was conducted by Aji et al. [86]. This method used urea as a passivation agent to catalyze C-dot formation from the carbon source (mangosteen water extract). Other than the urea concentration, the reaction temperature can also influence the photoluminescent properties of C-dots. Interestingly, a higher incubation temperature (up to 300\u202f\u00b0C) resulted in smaller C-dots and increased luminescence, a phenomenon that may be attributed to the CN bond trapping emission energy.\n\n\nAC for contaminant removal and battery components\nMangosteen pericarp can serve as an appropriate source for AC production because its tissue consists of low ash and high carbon content originating from structural cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose. The process to produce AC involves tissue grinding into small materials (approximately less than 80 mesh) before drying at approximately 65\u202f\u00b0C. AC is a good adsorbent, as it has a high surface area. AC usage is perhaps among the easiest and cheapest water purification strategies compared with other conventional techniques, such as chemical oxidation, biological treatment, and membrane filtration [87].\nCarbonized mangosteen tissues have been used for contaminant removal. For instance, the use of a mangosteen shell as AC functionalized by nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) was able to effectively remove (up to 80%) the pollutant Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB) in the presence of solar energy (Fig. 5\n) [88]. RBB is known as a toxic chemical dye from the fabric industry, and hence, the fabricated photocatalyst N-TiO2 can be used for treating and removing such waste [88]. Mangosteen peel synthesized into magnetic biochar using the pyrolysis technique can remove methylene blue, cadmium ion [89], plumbum ion, rhodamine B dye [90], and lead [91] contaminants from wastewater. Similarly, AC derived from mangosteen peel has been embedded into calcium-alginate beads to remove aqueous methylene blue [92,93]. Another study using mangosteen peel AC was able to adsorb and remove CO2\n[94], suggesting its potential application for CO2 removal from combustion. Furthermore, mangosteen pericarp powder has been used as a coagulant, effectively removing up to 99% of water turbidity in the presence of aluminum sulfate [95]. This property may be attributed to the mangosteen powder microcoil structure, which entraps contaminants and impurities in the water [95]. Interestingly, AC from a mangosteen shell prepared by potassium hydroxide activation was able to purify and refine biodiesel from impurities [96], suggesting its wide applications.\nAC generated from mangosteen rind is also utilized in battery production. A hierarchical porous carbon generated from carbonized and activated mangosteen rind was able to deliver a high discharge capacity of up to 870\u202fmAh\/g when used as a composite cathode for a lithium sulfur battery [97]. Furthermore, the cell demonstrated a high capacity retention and capability rate [97,98]. In addition, a low-cost hard carbon (HC) anode for sodium ion batteries was developed from the mangosteen peel by Wang et al. [99]. The fabricated HC showed a low average potential but high reversible capacity. The maximum specific capacity achieved by the HC sample was 330 mAh\/g after 100 cycles with excellent capacity retention (98%). In the future, these fabricated batteries from such biomass waste may be able to replace rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in portable electronics and energy storage systems.\n\n\nBiomedical advanced materials\nThe medicinal properties of mangosteen extract have sparked interest in their utilization in advanced materials of biomedical benefit. For instance, rubber latex gloves embedded with powder from mangosteen peel extract have an antimicrobial property for use in a medical environment [100]. Furthermore, an electrospun polyacrylonitrile fiber mixed with dried mangosteen water extract possesses anti-microbial activities against various Staphylococcus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains [101]. Such a fiber is therefore useful in minimizing bacterial contamination, particularly preventing the spread of tuberculosis for many filtration applications, including facemasks and respirators. Electrospun nanofibers developed from polyvinylpyrrolidone with encapsulated mangosteen extract exhibited high antioxidant activity [102,103]. The nanofiber allows mangosteen extract\/compounds to disperse throughout the fiber\u2019s molecular structure, increasing the surface area for efficient drug delivery application [102,103].\nFurthermore, microemulsion of \u03b1-mangostin may have potential for drug delivery as the nanosized particles improve the compound bioavailability, and it was indeed highly present in treated rat organs, such as the stomach, liver, and spleen [104,105]. Similarly, mangosteen ethyl acetate fraction loaded into a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system was able to penetrate the skin layer (stratum corneum), suggesting its applicability for cosmetic products or skin damage treatment [106,107]. Mangosteen extract has also been applied as a topical gel. Priani et al. [108] developed a microemulsion gel containing an n-hexane fraction of mangosteen pericarp that is able to protect skin from UV exposure (a sun protection factor of 4.01). Furthermore, Astuti et al. [109] used gel formulation of mangosteen rind (ethyl acetate extract) mixed with sodium polyacryloydimethyl taurate (gelling agent), propylene glycol (humectant), glycerin (cosolvent), MicroCare\u00ae preservative, and an alkalizing agent for the controlled release of \u03b1-mangostin. This formulation is important for a skin application with a prolonged anti-bacterial property.\nAnother strategy to increase the solubility and, hence, the bioavailability of xanthones, particularly \u03b1-mangostin, has been reported by Phunpee et al. [110]. This study utilized quaternized beta-cyclodextrin grafted chitosan to generate an inclusion complex with \u03b1-mangostin. The results showed that the \u03b1-mangostin complex was gradually released within a simulated saliva buffer compared with the dissoluble free \u03b1-mangostin. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans were significantly higher for the \u03b1-mangostin inclusion complex compared with its free form, which is possibly attributed to the increased solubility of the complex [110]. Mangosteen has also been used as a modified carrier molecule. Nano-fibrillated cellulose developed from its rind was used to emulsify and encapsulate vitamin D to facilitate compound bioavailability within the gastrointestinal tract [111].\nAnother advanced material using mangosteen in the biomedical industry is metallic nanoparticles. For instance, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) has been promoted as a drug and antibody delivery system due to its multiple surface functionality [112]. Natural products, such as mangosteen peel, have been used as reducing agents to generate AuNP using a greener approach [112,113]. Moreover, the biofabrication of mangosteen bark extract with silver nanoparticle (AgNP), in combination with ultrasonic exposure, has enabled targeted cancer treatment [114,115]. This advancement is particularly important because, during a single ultrasonic treatment, healthy and cancerous cells are negatively impacted. The use of the AgNP successfully reduced the population of cancerous cells (lung cancer) by more than two fold but did not affect healthy normal cells [114]. Additionally, copper nanoparticle prepared with the addition of mangosteen leaf extract has shown promising antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus\n[116]. These lines of evidence suggest that mangosteen biomass waste can be valorized into highly valuable components in the medicinal and pharmaceutical fields, benefitting societal well-being in the long term. As first coined by Fairchild [117], mangosteen is truly the \u201cQueen of Fruits.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nThis review summarizes recent literature about mangosteen properties, uses, and applications in various industries and scientific fields. The fruit shelf life, ripening process, and metabolite composition were investigated in several postharvest studies. Furthermore, mangosteen has been used in the food industry, particularly as functional food, animal feed, and for food shelf-life determination. Other areas of interest are engineering and materials sciences. Mangosteen extract has been utilized in natural fabric dye, DSSCs, biosensory applications, contaminant removal, battery production, and antibacterial and anticancer materials. This wide utilization of mangosteen, ranging from technological and biomedical applications to advanced materials, deserves the utmost attention of local governments to further promote the fruit and its cultivation. In the future, mangosteen-derived products are envisioned to benefit various communities, including local growers, farmers, and consumers, as well as the biomaterial and biomedical industries.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects\n\n\n","1546":"\n\nIntroduction\nInterstitial cystitis(IC), aurinary tract infection, refers to the chronic inflammation and stress that disrupt the upper urinary tract functions. Pathological syndromes of IC may have urinary frequency, pain with urination, and dysuria, hematuria, hemorrhage [1,2]. The common cause of infection is Escherichia coli. In addition, drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis is another inflammation of the bladder [3,4]. The main clinical therapy against IC isantibiotic medication by the time- and dose-dependent manners, such as nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim (uncomplicated case), phenazopyridine (complicated case) [5]. However, a long-term treatment of antibiotics may induce drug resistance over time. Therefore, further development of candidate medication to treat IC is needed. Curcumol, isolated from Rhizoma Curcumaeis, is a bioactive component with potent pharmacological activities. And it is characterized with potential anti-inflammatory, anti-virus, anti-microbial, and anti-cancer effects [6,7]. Increasing evidences has suggested that curcumol plays a potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells [8]. However, the pharmacological study of curcumol against IC is limited presently. In addition to literature analysis, a predictive tool of network pharmacology can optimize and propose the main functional targets and molecular mechanisms of bioactive component against disease [9]. Therefore, the current study used network pharmacology-analyzed bioinformatic data to uncover the main predictive targets, and correlative biological processes and signaling pathways of curcumol against IC. In parallel, the samples of clinical IC and curcumol-treated rats were collected and established to characterize the pathological and pharmacological biotargets, respectively. Together, the graphical abstract of this study design was demonstrated visibly in Fig. 1\n.\n\n\nExperimental\n\nIdentification of candidate targets of curcumol against IC\nAll curcumol-associated functional targets were collected from the databases of PharmMapper (http:\/\/lilab.ecust.edu.cn\/pharmmapper\/submit_file.php) and Swiss Target Prediction (http:\/\/www.swisstargetprediction.ch\/index.php). In addition, pathogenetic andtherapeutictargets of IC were produced from the databases of DisGeNET (http:\/\/www.disgenet.org\/web\/DisGeNET\/menu\/search?0), Drugbank (https:\/\/www.drugbank.ca\/), Therapeutic Target Database (https:\/\/db.idrblab.org\/ttd\/), respectively. Further, the curcumol-pharmacological targets were pooled with cystitis-pathologic targets before picking up the predictive targets of curcumol against IC.\n\n\nConstruction of PPI network and verification of main targets of curcumol against IC\nThe pooled targets of curcumol against IC were projected into FunRich_3.1.3 software (http:\/\/www.funrich.org\/) to establish the target-functional proteins. And a PPI network of predictive targets was constructed. In addition, the identifiable data were further imported to Cytoscape (v3.6.1) (https:\/\/cytoscape.org\/). The network analyzer setting was used to visualize the network targets of curcumol against IC based on topological parameters. The optimal targets were identified according to the maximum degree values.\n\n\nConfirmation of biological processes and molecular pathways of curcumol against IC\nThe Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database (https:\/\/david.ncifcrf.gov\/home.jsp) was used to extract the available biological functions related to core targets. These data were further introduced in the Omicshare Cloud Platform (http:\/\/www.omicshare.com\/tools\/Home\/Soft\/gogsea) to visualize the biological processes and signaling pathways from the core targets of curcumin anti-IC. And a p-value was used to plot advanced bubble diagrams of biological processes and signaling pathways.\n\n\nHuman designs\nAdult male patients (n\u202f=\u202f3) were diagnostically determined as IC through the biochemical, pathological, and medical imaging tests at Department of Urology Surgery. The serological data and clinical imaging were collected for further analyses. Additionally, IC samples of all these cases were surgically isolated during precancerous screening, followed by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence stains. All principles of this human study were conducted following the guidelines issued by Declaration of Helsinki\n[10].\n\n\nAnimal designs\nAdult female Kunming mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Unit of Guilin Medical University (Guilin, China). The mice were maintained in animal house under the controlled conditions of 22\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C, around 60\u202f\u00b1\u202f5% humidity, 12 altered hours in cycled light\/dark. The mice were allowed to have filtered water and rodent chow freely. The present study was authorized through Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Guilin Medical University. After acclimatization for at least one week, the anticancer drug-induced IC mice by cyclophosphamide (CPS) was established as previously described [11]. Briefly, the fresh-prepared CPS solution were given to mice via oral gavage with 50\u202fmg\/kg in body weight every 3\u202fdays, followed by curcumol treatments (40 and 80\u202fmg\/kg; w\/w) for consecutive 12\u202fdays. At the end of experiment, the serum and bladder samples from all mice were isolated for biochemical tests, and stains used for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. For more details, all immunostaining procedures were referenced in previous description [12].\n\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe blood results were expressed as mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD). The mice data were assayed through statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software (IL, USA). Multiple comparisons were calculated by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test. The statistical significance was considered as P\u202f<\u202f0.05.\n\n\nResults\n\nCandidate targets and identification of core targets\nAfter bioinformatic assays, all 64 IC-pathogenic targets and 314 curcumol-therapeutic targets were screened. For further validation, 8 predictive targets were identified ultimately. A PPI network of curcumol against IC was constructed through assaying a function-related protein-protein interaction in these 8 functional targets. As shown in PPI network analysis, the hub network had 137 nodes and 449 edges with interactions and associations (Fig. 2\n). In topology parameters, the shorter path length and the larger median value indicated the more important targets. After calculation, 18 core targets were optimally obtained. According to the resultant visualization, the predictive targets of ERBB2, EGFR and PTK2 were the most important (Fig. 3\n).\n\n\nBiological function and signaling pathways of curcumol against IC\nAs results, the top 20 biological function enrichments were obtained through DAVID database and omicshare cloud platform. As shown in Fig. 4\n, the results showed that the biological processes from the predictive targets of curcumol against IC were principally linked to regulating the ERBB2 signaling pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, MAPK cascade, peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation (PI3-K), phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, negative regulation of apoptotic process, protein autophosphorylation, positive regulation of GTPase activity, signal transduction, peptidyl-tyrosine autophosphorylation, positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process, leukocyte migration, heart development, regulation of cell motility, positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, positive regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, Fc-epsilon receptor signaling pathway. In addition, the signaling pathways were chiefly involved in the Proteoglycans in cancer, ErbB signaling pathway, Endometrial cancer, Focal adhesion, Prolactin signaling pathway, Prostate cancer, Estrogen signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, Non-small cell lung cancer, Glioma, Chronic myeloid leukemia, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Pathways in cancer, Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, MicroRNAs in cancer, GnRH signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Bladder cancer, Thyroid hormone signaling pathway, respectively.\n\n\nCase reports of patients with IC\nTo reveal the clinical and histopathological characteristics of IC, human data and samples were used to assay. In urinary examination, these IC patients showed positive urinary protein, bacterial infection, and visible epithelial cell shedding (Table 1\n). As shown in clinical computed tomography (CT) screening, chronic cystitis with urinary tract infection was observed. In addition, histopathological stains resulted in elevated intracellular expression of TNF-\u03b1 in these IC sections. In order to characterize the predictive target of PTK2 in human samples, histopathological and immunofluorescent stains were conducted for further validation. As a result, the IC sections showed increased expressions of PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397 in bladder tissues (Fig. 5\n).\n\n\nExperimental study of PTK2 targets in curcumol-treated mice\nTo further validate the predictive PTK2 targets of curcumol against IC in vivo, well-established CPS-induced IC in mice were used for experimental assays. As results, CPS-lesioned mice showed reduced body weights, and elevated contents of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-6,TNF-\u03b1 in sera (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Interestingly, high dose of curcumol treatment beneficially increased body mass, and lowered blood contents of LD, IL-6,TNF-\u03b1 (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Table 2\n). In histopathological observation with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stains, CPS-lesioned mice exhibited morphological changes, inflammatory infiltration, and necrotic cells in bladder tissues. However, curcumol-treated mice showed reduced CPS-inducedcytotoxicityin bladder cells, such as decreased necrotic cells and inflammatorylesions. Followed by immunohistochemical staining, CPS-lesioned bladders in mice resulted in increased intracellular expression of TNF-\u03b1, while curcumol-treated mice showed reduced endogenous TNF-\u03b1 expression in bladder sections.\nIn addition, immunofluorescence stainingwas used to check intracellular expressions of PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397. As results, CPS-lesioned mice showed elevated PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397 expressions in bladder sections. After cotreatment with curcumol, the cellular expressions of PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397 were down-regulated in comparison with those in CPS-lesioned controls (Fig. 6\n).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study, a bioactive component-target-disease network was constructed by using the network pharmacology-based bioinformatics. And resultant 18 core targets were identified through further analysis. According to the bioinformatic results, predictive ErbB2, EGFR and PTK2 were the most important targets of curcumol against IC. Tyrosine protein kinases (PTKs) are a group of functional enzymes that can catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate tyrosine residues, and these molecules play the key roles in cellular signaling pathways [13,14]. It is believed that the parathyroid hormones (PTHs) signaling is mainly involved in cell growth and proliferation through modulating the PTKs-MAPK pathway [15]. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) functions as a \u201cbridge\u201d connecting extracellular stimuli and intracellular gene expression. It functionally regulates tumor growth and metastasis, as well as biologically participates in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis through a series of effectors\u2019 activation and inactivation [16,17]. The biomolecules of ErbB2, EGFR and PTK2 belong to PTK family. ErbB2 refers to one of the important oncogenes in the EGFR family, and it is a transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase activity [18,19]. EGFR is a receptor protein that distributes on the membrane of epithelial cells. When combined with ligands, EGFR activates the downstream signaling molecules and induces the biological effects, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. In addition, EGFR plays a promotive role in transformation of malignant cells [20,21]. PTK2, known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase located in the cytoplasm. Functionally, the activation of PTK2 is to promote the formation of tumor, and it also has other biological activities of regulating cellular apoptosis and stress [22,23]. Recently, some studies have found that PTK2 is positively expressed in bladder cancer cells, and the over-expression of PTK2 facilitates the neoplastic cells to escape from apoptotic signals, gradually promoting tumor growth, metastasis [24,25]. Interestingly, these functional molecular pathways from literature review were similarly proposed in this study. However, the experimental investigation of PTK2 in interstitial cystitis is not yet conducted. Based on bioinformatic findings, the current study predicted the core targets of curcumol against IC through a network pharmacology method. As a result, a key biotarget of PTK2 was representatively selected for further validation in human samples. In addition to positive detection of TNF-\u03b1 expression in IC sections, intravesical PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397 were markedly up-regulated through immunostaining. The activated PTK2 were positive correlation with cystitis conditions in urinary tests. These clinicopathological findings indicated that intracellular over-expression of PTK2 might be a key pathological promoter in development of IC. Further, PTK2 might be a potential therapeutic target for IC.\nTo further validate experimental study in vivo, CPS-induced IC mice were used to evaluate the pharmacological activities of curcumol against IC. As results, curcumol-treated mice showed reduced inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,TNF-\u03b1) in sera and suppressed intracellular cytotoxicity, characterized with down-regulated expressions of PTK2, p-PTK2Tyr397 in bladder cells. Therefore, this study can be reasoned that the anti-IC activities of curcumol might benefit from the anti-inflammatory effects through suppressing intravesical PTK2 and phosphorylation bioactivities.\n\n\nConclusions\nCollectively, these bioinformatic and experimental findings demonstrate that predictive targets of curcumol against IC may be mainly linked to inhibition of inflammation-associated pathways and inactivation of intracellular PTK2 activity in bladder cells. It highlights that bioinformatic method based on network pharmacology may predict the biological markers for IC screening and treating. Interestingly, PTK2 may be a potential biomarker for curcumol treating IC.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n","1547":"\n\nIntroduction\nFor a number of environmental and techno-economic reasons, smart grids have become the subject of significant interest over the last few years [1,2]. A particular focus is related to the application of smart grids in distribution systems, where most power system losses and failures occur. For this reason, distribution systems are currently undergoing a significant transition to a new structure with respect to information, control, and power flow.\nPower flow represents an essential engine in application software for distribution systems [3]. Power flow methods are divided into two categories based on the state variable that is employed for solving the power flow problem: either the node voltage or the branch current [3]. In the first category, numerous power flow methods have been developed since the 1960s, including network equivalence methods [4], Newton-Raphson methods [5], and fast decoupled methods [6]. The second category is associated with the development of techniques such as backward\/forward sweep methods [7], which are widely used in commercial software [8,9].\nOptimizing distribution system assets is a fundamental functionality of smart distribution networks (SDNs). However, even if the convergence of power flow methods is guaranteed, they are not suitable for real-time applications that require an optimal power flow (OPF). These applications require not only a robust OPF but also a fast OPF algorithm, which is the main focus of this work.\nThe OPF problem involves solving for an optimal operating point for a distribution system that minimizes a predefined cost function, such as system losses or generation scenarios that are subject to specific techno-economic and\/or environmental constraints on system variables [10]. The OPF usually involves two convergence problems: (1) the convergence of the power flow to a feasible solution and (2) the convergence of the optimization to a global optimum.\nMany optimization techniques guarantee the feasibility of the solution, which in turn guarantees the convergence of the power flow problem [11]. However, with regard to the optimization and because the unbalance power flow problem is a nonlinear highly nonconvex problem [12], the convergence to a global optimum is not guaranteed. To address this limitation, several methods have been proposed for the global optimization of nonlinear problems, such as convexification [13] and branch-and-reduce [14] methods. OPF convergence problems have thus been adequately addressed in the research.\nTo perform a real-time process, such as energy storage system scheduling, the whole process should be completed in the range of half of a minute up to a few minutes. This process involves not only OPF but also other algorithms, such as topology processing, load allocation, and forecasting. These algorithms are components of the future smart grid energy management systems, which should be designed to address various grid and customer technologies. Most of the recent work in the area of smart grids utilizes optimization software for solving OPF problems, but a major aspect of real-time applications, the computational time required by the proposed algorithms, has not yet been examined.\nPrevious works [15\u201327] proposed a variety of approaches for coordinating different SDN components\/assets in real time: energy storage systems (charging\/discharging), electric vehicle (EV) charging, distributed generation (DG), volt\/var control equipment, and\/or residential load consumption.\nSome of the abovementioned research has failed to consider power flow [15,16]. Other studies considered the power flow constraints for balanced distribution systems [17\u201322]. Linearization of the power flow constraints was proposed elsewhere [23,24], where the power flow formulas were linearized around an estimated operation point. This method can lead to inaccurate results, which in turn can have severe consequences in real time. For example, the voltage magnitude or the limits for voltage unbalance could be violated in the actual distribution system on unmonitored nodes but not in the linearized approximated model. The work presented by Maffei et al. [25] proposed a real-time OPF for energy management in smart grids utilizing the preceding horizon technique. The approaches reported previously [26,27] are based on the real-time energy management of controllable loads and EVs in unbalanced distribution systems. However, the approaches described earlier [25\u201327] utilized commercial software for solving the required optimization problem, which cannot be relied upon in real-time applications, as explained in this section. Moreover, no mention is made of the computational time, which is a highly critical aspect and can be a barrier to the practical implementation of any energy management system.\nSome work utilized different techniques to solve large scale OPF problems. In Ref. [28], the authors utilized Benders decomposition to reduce the problem size. The work in [29] proposed using a genetic algorithm (GA) and fuzzy clustering to increase the computational speed. Mostafa et al. [30] proposed a multi-objective technique for optimizing the unbalanced system operation under a high penetration of renewable DG by minimizing the system losses and improving the voltage profile. The work presented by others [29,30] relied on the utilization of a GA to solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. However, meta-heuristic techniques are unsuitable for real-time applications in smart grids for two reasons: (1) the computational time required for these techniques is unpredictable, and (2) for large systems in which the decision variables might be in the range of hundreds or thousands, these techniques are likely to be slow compared to the gradient-based techniques.\nTo solve the unbalanced OPF problem, researchers usually employ optimization software tools, which normally find a solution for the optimization problem using a procedure that includes an evaluation of the approximated values for the constraint derivatives, which is known as the Jacobian matrix. For large networks, the use of an approximated Jacobian matrix, based, for example, on finite differences, significantly increases the computational time. It is well known that providing the derivatives of the constraints to the solver produces a more reliable solution and decreases the computational time. The solver can also find a feasible point for the problem; however, the finite differences around that feasible point may result in an infeasible solution that causes the solver to terminate prematurely without reaching an optimal feasible solution [31].\nThe work presented in this paper is focused on the optimization unit, which is a core element of any energy management system (EMS). The optimization unit is responsible for solving the assigned OPF problem by the EMS. In this work, we propose a new generalized Jacobian matrix formulation for improving accuracy and reducing the computational time in an unbalanced OPF for SDNs.\n\n\nEnergy management system for SDN\nTo optimize the SDN operation in real time, local distribution companies (LDCs) usually adopt a general procedure, whereby a central controller receives data from the users and the metering system via a communication infrastructure. This step is defined as stage 1 in Fig. 1\n. These data is preprocessed according to the measured values, type of measurement, and time stamp of the measurement; the data is then stored in the database (DB). Further, the data are processed in stage 2 by the forecasting unit to predict future consumptions or generations. In stage 3, all the parameters are sent to the optimization engine to process the real-time OPF to develop the optimal operation decisions of the SDN, which are returned back to the DB. These results are then used in stage 4 for (1) updating the situational awareness about the SDN conditions and (2) updating the control actions of the local controllers (LCs) within the SDN.\nFor real-time SDN system\/market operations, this process should be completed as quickly as possible; a few seconds for small systems and up to a few minutes for large systems is considered an appropriate range. The computational time needed for solving the OPF problem represents a major challenge. This is the time it takes for the parameters to be sent to the optimization unit until when the optimal decisions are received, as shown in Fig. 1. The OPF run-time increases exponentially as the size of the system increases. The research presented in this paper addresses Jacobian matrix evaluation, which is a core element for solving the OPF problem. The derivation of the proposed form of the Jacobian matrix for unbalanced distribution systems is explained in the next section.\n\n\nProposed generalized OPF\nThis section presents the derivation of a Jacobian matrix for the proposed generalized OPF. In general, any OPF problem can be formulated as follows:\n\n(1)\n\n\nM\ni\nn\nf\n(\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nand is subject to\n\n(2)\n\n\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\nh\n\n(\nw\n)\n\n\n\n(\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2264\n0\n\n\n\nwhere \n\nv\n\n, \n\nu\n\n, and \n\nw\n\n are the indices for the variables, equality constraints, and inequality constraints, respectively; \n\nf\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n is the objective function; \n\ng\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nh\n\n(\nw\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n are the equality and inequality constraints, respectively.\nAny OPF problem includes the power flow mismatch constraints expressed in Eqs. (4) and (5) as the equality constraints. The remaining equality and inequality constraints define other technical, environmental, and economical constraints, which are selected based on the system requirements. Eqs.

Since some of the load bus quantities might be measured or known, while others are unknown, it is assumed that the measured or known quantities are voltage dependent. In contrast, the unknown quantities are assumed to be voltage independent because their values are unknown or variable in any case.\nSolving this nonlinear programming problem requires three sets of derivatives: (1) the gradient, (2) the Jacobian matrix, and (3) the Hessian matrices. The focus of the research presented in this paper is the Jacobian matrix parametric definition and the fast numerical computation for the SDN OPF runs.\nIn this study, all the SDN active and reactive powers, voltages, and voltage angles are assumed as variables, and all variables and parameters are considered in per-unit values. It is assumed that the Jacobian matrix size is \n\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\n, where \n\nm\n\n is the number of constraints and \n\nn\n\n is the number of variables. Only the power flow constraints and variables are considered in this paper. The Jacobian matrix \n\nJ\n\n can be given as in (6). Thus, each entry \n\nJ\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n\n in the Jacobian matrix is defined as in (7), which corresponds to the differentiation of constraint \n\nu\n\n with respect to (w.r.t.) variable \n\nv\n\n. These considerations mean that each constraint must be differentiated w.r.t. all variables.\n\n(6)\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\n\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ef\n\n\n\n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\u22f1\n\n\n\u22ee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u22ef\n\n\n\n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7)\n\n\nJ\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n=\nJ\n\n\n\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200\nu\n\u2264\nm\n,\n\nv\n\u2264\nn\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming the total number of buses in the system is \n\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n, the total number of variables can be defined as \n\n3\n\u00d7\n6\n\u00d7\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n, where \n\n3\n\n refers to the number of phases, and \n\n6\n\n refers to \n\n\nP\n\nL\n1\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n, \n\n\nQ\n\nL\n1\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n, \n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, \n\n\nQ\n\nG\n(\ni\n)\n\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n, \n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n and\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n. Moreover, the number of constraints for any OPF can be identified as \n\n3\n\u00d7\n2\n\u00d7\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n, where \n\n3\n\n refers to the number of phases, and \n\n2\n\n refers to the two type of constraints: the active power mismatch \n\n\ng\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\nP\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n and the reactive power mismatch \n\n\ng\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\nQ\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n. Therefore, the Jacobian matrix would have \n\n6\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n rows, corresponding to the constraints, and \n\n18\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n columns, corresponding to the variables. The Jacobian matrix thus can be defined as in (8), where the entry \n\nJ\n\n\n\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n refers to \n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n\/\nd\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n. The \n\n6\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n constraints and their derivatives, which represent the Jacobian matrix entries, are defined in (9)\u2013(27), as explained below.\nAs a first step in forming the Jacobian matrix, the Jacobian entries are initialized to zero, i.e.\n\n,\nJ\n\n\n\n\ng\n\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n,\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n\u2200\nu\n\u2264\nm\n,\nv\n\u2264\nn\n\n. This step is included because most Jacobian entries are zeros due to the radial structure of distribution systems; each bus is usually connected to two or three buses. For example, assume that bus \n\ni\n\n is connected only to buses \n\ni\n+\n1\n\n and \n\ni\n-\n1\n\n. This arrangement means that all the entries for the power mismatch constraint for bus \n\ni\n\n in the Jacobian matrix will be zeros except for those corresponding to buses \n\ni\n-\n1\n,\ni\n,\n\nand \n\ni\n+\n1\n\n.\nAfter all the Jacobian entries have been initialized to zeros, as a second step, each entry is updated. The active power mismatch entries are derived first and followed by the reactive power mismatch entries.\n\nJacobian matrix entries for active power constraints\nTo update the Jacobian matrix entries for the active power constraints, i.e., \n\nd\n\ng\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\nP\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n\/\nd\n\nx\n\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n, the procedure shown in Fig. 2\n can be used, which is explained as follows. Based on (4), each bus has up to three active power mismatch constraints, as in (9). The Jacobian matrix entries corresponding to the variables \n\n\nP\n\nL\n1\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n can thus be derived as in (10) and (11).\nAs indicated in (9), \n\n\ng\n\n(\ni\n)\n\n\nP\n\n(\n\np\n1\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n is composed of two major terms: a positive double summation and a negative double summation. Each summation can be broken down into three components so that \n\n\ng\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n can be rewritten as in (12), where \n\n\ng\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n is composed of six terms.

and discussion\nFor the purpose of evaluation, the proposed Jacobian was tested on two systems. The first is a simple 4-bus radial system, which is a small part of a real system located in Ontario, Canada. The system has a simple structure, as shown in Fig. 3\n. The second system is the IEEE 123-bus system [32], which is illustrated in Fig. 4\n. The load and line data for the 4-bus system and the 123-bus system are shown in Table 1\n and in [32], respectively. In both cases, it is assumed that the central controller that hosts the energy management system is located at the substation or main grid connection. For each case, the exact Jacobian \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n was generated in a MATLAB\u00ae environment using symbolic differentiation of the power flow mismatch equations in (12) and (19).\nTo develop the exact Jacobian, the symbolic differentiation deals with each single constraint as a whole mathematical formula while considering the derivatives w.r.t. all possible variables. On the other hand, the proposed Jacobian \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n is customized to the structure of the distribution system and develops the derivatives as the sum of individual terms. Mathematically, both \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n are identical in their output.\nThe exact Jacobian development, which is performed off-line, took 1.5\u202fmin for the simple 4-bus system and 13.5\u202fh for the 123-bus system. On the other hand, the proposed Jacobian can be implemented directly without the need for preprocessing. For large practical systems, the computer will run out of memory trying to perform symbolic differentiation. This was the case when a practical test-case of a 575-bus unbalanced system was tested.\nMoreover, for any topology change due to fault clearing or seasonal reconfiguration, \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n must be developed for the new topology, which is very time consuming for large systems and will cause a considerable delay in the EMS process.\nFor simplicity, a simple OPF case was considered, in which each bus had six variables: \n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\na\nn\nd\n\nQ\n\nG\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\n\n for the slack bus and \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\n\n for all other buses. The slack bus is the reference bus where the voltage magnitude and the voltage angles are known. The Jacobian matrix contains the derivative of the power mismatch equations (six equations for each bus), making the Jacobian matrix a size of \n\n6\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\u00d7\n6\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n. The reduction in the Jacobian matrix size compared to the size considered in the previous section (\n\n6\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\u00d7\n18\n\nN\n\nbus\n\n\n\n) is due to the assumption that each bus has only 6 variables instead of 18. The simulations were performed on a 3.6\u202fGHz dual core processor with 16\u202fGB of RAM. The optimization problems for the two case studies were solved using the constrained nonlinear optimization tool based on the interior point method in the MATLAB\u00ae environment.\nThe proposed Jacobian \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n was constructed for each case. \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n were compared to an approximated Jacobian \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n, which was evaluated using a finite difference approximated derivative, as in (28), for low values of \n\n\u0394\nx\n.\n\n In each case, a battery storage system (BSS) is controlled via an online signal from a central controller that runs the OPF problem, whereby the optimal charging\/discharging power is determined and the computational time is evaluated.\n\n(28)\n\n\n\n\ndf\n\n\ndx\n\n\n=\n\n\nf\n\n\n\nx\n+\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n\n-\nf\n\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-Bus test system\nFor the 4-bus test system, the Jacobian size is \n\n24\n\u00d7\n24\n\n. For the sake of comparison, the Jacobian is evaluated for the initial condition \n\n\nx\n0\n\n\n, which corresponds to \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\n=\n1\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n(\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n)\n\n\n=\n0\n,\n-\n2\n\u03c0\n\/\n3\n,\na\nn\nd\n2\n\u03c0\n\/\n3\n\n. The root mean square error, \n\nRMSE\n\n, which is defined in (29), is used for comparing the results:\n\n(29)\n\n\nRMSE\n=\n\n\n\n1\n\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nu\n\u2264\nm\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nv\n\u2264\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nE\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n is the difference between \n\n\nJ\n\ne\nx\na\nc\nt\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and either \n\n\nJ\n\na\np\np\nr\no\nx\n\n\n\nu\n,\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n or \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n(\nu\n,\nv\n)\n\n\n\n.\nAs shown in Fig. 5\n, as \n\n\u0394\nx\n\n decreases, the value of the \n\nRMSE\n\n for the approximate Jacobian is further reduced. However, reducing \n\n\u0394\nx\n\n is problematic because it approaches the precision limit of the software and hardware used for the computations. In this case, as \n\n\u0394\nx\n\n was reduced below 10\u22129, the value of the \n\nRMSE\n\n increased to 1.396\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129 at \n\n\nx\n0\n\n\n. On the other hand, for \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n, the error was zero, which shows that \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n is identical to \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n.\nThe three Jacobian matrices were evaluated at 1000 different values for \n\n\nx\n0\n\n\n w.r.t. the computation time, t. The computational time statistics are shown in Table 2\n.\nAs indicated, the proposed Jacobian computational time was much less than that for the approximate method but very close to the exact method. The mean computation time for the approximate Jacobian was 7.4\u202fms compared to 0.642\u202fms for the proposed Jacobian, which is almost 11 times faster. This discrepancy is attributable to two factors: (1) most of the derivatives are zeros, which is easily identified in \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n but must be evaluated for \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n; (2) for each term in the Jacobian matrix, \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n must evaluate a function twice as in (28), while \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n evaluates only one function.\nA comparison of the computational time of \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n to that of \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n reveals a slightly faster performance for the proposed formulation, as identified by a 2.4% reduction in the mean computational time. This decrease is due to the complexity of the form of \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n, where symbolic differentiation is considered in comparison to the compact form of \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n. As the size and complexity of the system increases, this difference is expected to be significant.\nTo test the proposed Jacobian for solving an OPF problem, a BSS is presumed to be located at bus 4. To simplify the analysis, the BSS optimal schedule (to charge and discharge) will be determined by the OPF run to minimize the overall system losses. The BSS is also assumed to operate at a unity power factor.\nAlthough the test case study is simple, the proposed Jacobian formulation is applicable (and scalable) to any OPF case study, including DER optimal management in microgrids and distribution networks, transactive energy markets modeling, simulation and analysis.\nTo determine the optimal power amount injected from the BSS \n\n\nP\n\nbat\n\n\n\n, a simple test was performed before applying the OPF, in which the injected power from the BSS was varied and the system losses were evaluated. The test outcomes showed that the system loss for the base case (\n\n\nP\n\nbat\n\n\n=\n0\n\n) was 0.0229\u202fp.u., which corresponded to 1.33% of the total system demand. On the other hand, the minimum loss was 0.0082\u202fp.u., or 0.48%, which occurred at \n\n\nP\n\nbat\n\n\n=\n1.24\n\n\u202fp.u., as shown in Fig. 6\n.\nTo test the proposed Jacobian computation method, an OPF problem was formulated as follows:\n\n(30)\n\n\n\nmin\n\nP\nbat\n\n\n\nP\n\nloss\n\n\nTot\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\np\nh\n1\n\n\n\nP\n\nloss\n\n\n(\np\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nis subject to\n\n(31)\n\n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nP\n\nL\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\u2208\nI\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\np\n2\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\u2208\nI\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\np\n2\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2208\nI\n,\n\np\n1\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(32)\n\n\n\nQ\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nQ\n\nL\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\u2208\nI\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\np\n2\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\u2208\nI\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\np\n2\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nsin\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n\ni\n,\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n,\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2208\nI\n,\n\np\n1\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(33)\n\n\n\nP\n\nloss\n\n\n(\np\n1\n)\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\ni\n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\nP\n\nL\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2200\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(34)\n\n\n\nV\n\nmin\n\n\n\u2264\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2264\n\nV\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2208\nI\n,\n\np\n1\n\n\u2208\n\nH\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(35)\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nV\n\nslack\n\n\n,\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n,\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n=\n-\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n3\n\n,\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n3\n\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2208\n\nI\n\nslack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(36)\n\n\n\nP\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\nQ\n\nG\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2209\n\nI\n\nslack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(37)\n\n\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\/\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u2200\ni\n\u2208\n\nI\n\nbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\notherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nV\n\nmin\n\n\na\nn\nd\n\nV\n\nmax\n\n\n\n are the minimum and maximum voltage limits, respectively, which are set to 0.95 and 1.05, respectively;\n\n\nV\n\nslack\n\n\n\n is the slack bus voltage, which is set to 1.05\u202fp.u.; \n\n\nI\n\nslack\n\n\n=\n\n{\n1\n}\n\n\n and \n\n\nI\n\nbat\n\n\n=\n\n{\n4\n}\n\n\n are the subsets of the slack bus and the BSS bus, respectively.\nThe nonlinear programming (NLP) OPF problem, defined in (30)\u2013(37), was solved using an interior-point algorithm in the MATLAB environment with default settings. The problem was first solved using finite differences. The optimal solution was \n\n\nP\n\nloss\n\n\nTot\n\n\n=\n0.0082\n\n\u202fp.u. at \n\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n1.2366\n\n\u202fp.u., which was very close to the values indicated in Fig. 6. The computational time was 100.81\u202fms.\nOn the other hand, when the gradient of the objective function and the Jacobian of the constraints were provided, the optimal solution was \n\n\nP\n\nloss\n\n\nTot\n\n\n=\n0.0082\n\n\u202fp.u. at \n\n\nP\n\nb\na\nt\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n1.2366\n\n\u202fp.u., which was identical to the values derived from using finite differences. The process took 23.76\u202fms, which represents a 76.43% reduction in the computational time.\n\n\n123-Bus test system\nThe 123-bus system is assumed to be moderately sized for a practical distribution system, which may contain more than 500 buses. Closing the switches and removing zero impedance lines reduces the 123-bus system to 119 buses, in which the size of the Jacobian matrix is \n\n714\n\u00d7\n714\n\n, which is equivalent to 509,796 entries in the matrix.\nThe time required for evaluating the Jacobian matrices was recorded for 100 different \n\n\nx\n0\n\n\n values. As shown in Table 3\n, the mean time for evaluating \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n was 24% less than the mean time required for evaluating \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n with a zero RMSE value. On the other hand, for\n\n\u0394\nx\n\n\u202f=\u202f10\u22129, the \n\nRMSE\n\n for \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n was 4.806\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126 at \n\n\nx\n0\n\n\n; this differs significantly from the RMSE for the 4-bus system, which was 1.396\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129. The mean computational time for \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n was 4.72\u202fs, which was 78 times higher than that for \n\n\nJ\n\nproposed\n\n\n\n.\nFor a moderately sized system, evaluating \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n for a single iteration may consume more than 4\u202fs, depending on the hardware and software used to solve for OPF. Thus, for a practical distribution system with hundreds of buses, evaluating \n\n\nJ\n\napprox\n\n\n\n in real time is impractical, and the error increases dramatically as the system becomes larger. In addition, developing \n\n\nJ\n\nexact\n\n\n\n is very time consuming and may lead to memory limitation errors, as explained previously. These considerations provide strong evidence of the need for a closed form Jacobian matrix, which could be easily coded and applied to solving real-time optimization problems in distribution systems, such as DER optimal management, transactive energy market clearing and the optimal pricing of DERs.\nIt is assumed that a BSS unit operating at a unity power factor is located at bus 49, which is chosen arbitrarily. Changing the output power of the BSS helps us in evaluating and minimizing the distribution system losses, as shown in Fig. 7\n. As indicated in the figure, the loss for the base case without the BSS was 95.94\u202fkW at point a, which was very close to the value of the system loss reported in [32] (95.611\u202fkW). As the injected power from the BESS increases, the system losses decrease, where the minimum loss was 64.05\u202fkW at \n\n\nP\n\nbat\n\n\n\n\u202f=\u202f1.667\u202fMW, which is shown as point b in Fig. 7. The decrease in the system losses is attributed to the reduction in the current flowing from the grid to supply the loads, which are supplied partially by the BESS. For losses greater than 1.667\u202fMW, increasing the injected power from the BESS causes an increase in the losses due to reverse power, where the excess current that flows from the BESS to the grid direction causes higher losses in the lines.\nTo test the proposed Jacobian matrix computation method, the same NLP problem expressed in (30)\u2013(37) was used, with the BSS connected to bus 49. The minimum system loss was 61.045\u202fkW at \n\n\nP\n\nbat\n\n\n\n\u202f=\u202f1.6151\u202fMW. Although the finite difference and the proposed Jacobian reached the same optimal solution, the computational times were 0.82158 and 25.57\u202fs with and without applying the Jacobian method, respectively. The case study results clearly showed that applying the proposed Jacobian method could substantially reduce the OPF computational time.\nMoreover, as the size of the system increases, the reduction becomes even greater, which emphasizes the necessity for providing the Jacobian of the constraints in real-time DER management or transactive energy market clearing; this may require solving a large OPF problem.\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThe work presented in this paper tackles a core element of any modern EMS, which is the optimization unit. The proposed approach targets the computational process for the optimization unit for real-time unbalanced SDN operations (e.g., smart grid applications). The proposed approach could help reduce the complexity and computational time associated with the SDN applications, which usually involve real-time optimal scheduling of the system assets (including DERs and demand response\/DR). The paper includes a detailed formulation of the proposed generalized Jacobian matrix, which can be tailored according to the real-time measurements and available system data.\nThe formulation presented for unbalanced SDNs is based on three sets of derivatives for the power mismatch constraints: (1) the derivative w.r.t. the same bus and the same phase voltage magnitude, (2) the derivative w.r.t. the same bus and a different phase voltage magnitude, and (3) the derivative w.r.t. different bus voltage magnitudes. The proposed Jacobian matrix formulation can be applied to any distribution network after adjustments are made depending on the available equipment, such as voltage regulators and capacitor banks.\nThe simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed formulation for evaluating the values of the Jacobian matrix entries in a timely manner and with zero RMSE error compared to the exact and approximated Jacobian evaluation methods. The results also provided enough evidence to support the need for using the proposed Jacobian matrix formulation in real-time OPF problem solving for smart grid applications, such as DER\/DR optimal management and transactive energy market clearing.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1548":"\n\nIntroduction\nAmerican surveys have shown that 8% of patients skip doses and 4% discontinue therapy due to difficulties in swallowing tablets [1]. Another barrier for therapy efficacy relates to patient aversion to injectable medications [2]. As buccal administration does not require swallowing nor needles, adherence to dosing regimens is likely to increase with buccal delivery. Buccal delivery provides easy access to highly vascularized tissue, avoiding first-pass metabolism and concomitant liquid intake. Furthermore, the neutral environment of the mouth allows for administration of acid-sensitive active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [3]. Drugs can permeate the buccal mucosa more rapidly than they permeate the skin, but less rapidly than they permeate the intestinal wall. Absorption rates depend on drug physicochemical properties, such as molecular size, hydrophobicity, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and region of delivery inside the oral cavity [4,5]. Noteworthy, a buccal dosage form can release drug to the oral cavity and promote absorption throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\nBuccal dosage forms include mucoadhesive tablets, films, patches, ointments, and hydrogels, each of which has limitations [6]. For instance, ointments and hydrogels are semi-solids that lack dosage precision or adequate hardness to resist tongue removal [4,7]. Although precision can be increased with mucoadhesive tablets, they are often uncomfortably large, limiting long-term residence and release time [6,8]. These disadvantages can be overcome with the use of films, patches, and wafers [6,9]. Buccal films are currently the preferred commercial dosage form for extended transmucosal delivery; their action depends on slow matrix erosion, high mucoadhesiveness, and adequate drug loading. However, these carriers contain enough water to favour microbial contamination or degradation of sensitive APIs [10]. Lyophilized wafers can sustain drug release as well, with the benefits of low residual moisture and increased drug loading (for low solubility drugs) [3,11]. To date, extended release wafers have been restricted to noncommercial formulations.\nFor rapid onset of drug action, several companies rely on orodispersible dosage forms (ODFs). These systems disintegrate rapidly in the mouth and increase therapy efficacy for disorders that require fast intervention [12]. ODFs include orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs), quick-dissolving lyophilized wafers (oral lyophilizates), and thin films [13]. According to the FDA, an ODF must be small, lightweight (up to 500\u202fmg), and must disintegrate within 30\u202fs [14]. Among the options, wafers present highly porous solid matrixes obtained by freeze-drying of polymer gels or suspensions to an average of 3\u202fmm thickness and 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f12\u202fmm size [15,16] (Fig. 1\n). Owing to their potential therapeutic advantages and lack of review articles on wafer systems, this study focused on the production process, parameters, and formulation features of wafers.\n\n\nTherapy gains\nWafer products are available to patients for immediate release of several APIs (Table 1\n). Most of these medicines showed better patient compliance, especially in acute pathologies or symptoms. For instance, acute attacks of migraine often come with nausea, which implicate in parenteral medication to avoid vomiting. With the advent of Rizatriptan wafers, pain decreases after around 20\u201330\u202fmin of drug administration, like standard subcutaneous sumatriptan. Although Rizatriptan is 45% bioavailable, compared to 95% of subcutaneous sumatriptan, its rapid onset of action, oral intake and similar efficacy pattern makes patients prefer the former [17,18]. To inhibit nausea and vomiting of migraine attacks and other medical conditions, fast-disintegrating antiemetics versions gained wide acceptance, including ondansetron and domperidone. Oral ondansetron was as efficacious as its intravenous administration in prevent emesis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [19].\nA prolonged seizure (over 5\u202fmin) is another condition that requires rapid chemotherapy without tablet\/liquid swallowing. Among the options, oral clonazepan wafers were as efficient as rectal diazepam in stopping seizures. This data alone is meaningful because it reduces patient embarrassment related to the rectal administration [20]. As a last case for illustration, the antihistaminics, desloratadine and loratadine, have wafer and tablet versions for relief of allergy symptoms. Wafers did not decrease the time to achieve a maximum concentration in plasma (Tmax) when compared to traditional tablets; however, a 5\u202fmg loratadine version resulted in 25% more drug bioavailability than its tablet counterpart. Since allergy symptoms include itchy throat, a fast-disintegrating dosage form can also decrease discomforts related to medicine administration [21].\nMucoadhesive wafers (without fast disintegration) were tested in few clinical trials, with no commercial representatives. Current research focuses consists of wound healing enhancement and pain management. On this matter, ketorolac\/lidocaine polymeric wafers reduced pain and enhanced tissue healing in dental patients previously subjected to gingivectomy [22].\n\n\nFormulation features\n\nMatrix forming polymers\nConcerning excipients, gelatin is the most used matrix-forming polymer (Table 1) of commercial oral lyophilisates. It is abundant in animals, cost-effective, biocompatible, biodegradable, and has favorable physicochemical properties (forms hydrogels and is hydrophilic, translucent, colorless, and flavorless). Gelatin forms physical crosslinks that break at body temperature [29]. This effect \u201cmelts\u201d the dosage form, resulting in drug release. Zydis\u00ae was the first gelatin-based technology available to patients. It can incorporate doses of up to 400\u202fmg of poorly soluble drugs and 60\u202fmg of water-soluble drugs. This technology has limitations: drug and excipient particles should be smaller than 50\u202f\u00b5m; hot packaging increase costs; inadequate friability is a common product defect [30]. Quicksolv\u00ae technology also uses gelatin as matrix (Table 1, Risperidone), but relies on more excipients and a second solvent to obtain a less friable product and facilitated packaging. In exchange, it limits drug options to the ones with low doses and immiscible in the second solvent [31]. The third and last technology (Lyoc\u00ae) with commercial medicines relies on xanthan gum as the matrix polymer (Fig. 2\nA). This polysaccharide forms coherent and stable freeze-dried forms, with the advantage of production and sustainability of a microbial source [32]. The apparent yield stress was reported as higher than for gelatin based products, which results in less friable wafers and facilitated storage\/package conditions [33]. A few Lyoc\u00ae products use polivinilpirrolidone instead of xantam gum or even no polymers at all (Table 1). Although there are many other wafer technologies on the market, we could not find commercial products using them.\nAlternative experimental polysaccharides include the algal derived alginate (Fig. 2B) and chitosan (Fig. 2C). For example, combination of alginate with magnesium aluminum silicate improved the stability of nicotine used for replacement therapy [35]. Extended release versions require mucoadhesiveness, which allows for longer swelling time in the buccal cavity. Experimental wafers can also be formulated with synthetic polymers, such as thiolated chitosan, which is reported to be up to 10 times more bioadhesive than chitosan, but still biodegradable. Hydrophilic sodium carboxymethyl cellulose delivers drugs effectively through gastrointestinal mucosal tissue absorption. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose does not require organic solvents and is usually combined with other matrix-formers, such as alginate [11,34\u201336].\nAs polymers constitute a large portion of the carrier, the following characteristics must be considered: molecular weight (adhesiveness increases above 100,000\u202fDa), chain flexibility (related to polymer diffusion through the mucosal surface), hydrogen bond formation capacity (greater hydrogen bonding augments interactions with the mucosal surface), and hydration capacity (favors increased contact with the barrier surface) [3,4]. Accordingly, natural cationic chitosan allows for extensive mucoadhesion, and provides permeation enhancement and inhibition of peptidases [5,37]. The performance of chitosan makes it an excellent candidate for use in prolonged release wafers, which is supported by at least 45 papers (PubMed search, October 25, 2018) and over 40 patents (Orbit software search, October 25, 2018). Gelatin can be used to prepare extended release wafers when combined with other excipients, including chitosan, which can enhance its mechanical properties and mucoadhesiveness [38,39].\nMatrix pore size, interconnections, and erosion\/swelling of the polymeric chain determine drug-matrix interactions and release rates. Crosslinkers in wafers are mainly ionic in nature and include divalent cations (such as CaCl2 for use with alginate) or polyanions (such as sodium tripolyphosphate, TPP, for use with chitosan) [40]. Alginate crosslinking occurs at physiological pH and room temperature, which are desired properties for biological applications and drug stability. In turn, chitosan crosslinks with TPP under mild acidic conditions, which limits labile drugs incorporation in the gel phase. Chemical crosslinking changes the polymer network and increases resistance to disintegration, which is why orodispersible forms do not include this additive [41].\n\n\nOther excipients\nFreeze-dried formulations have low water content, and do not support microbial growth, precluding the need for inclusion of these additives. However, some formulations (e.g. Zydis\u00ae technology) use these additives to inhibit microbial growth during manufacturing [42]. Oral lyophilizates generally contain taste-masking agents, lyoprotectors, and pH adjusters. Sweeteners mask unpleasant taste and are essential for patient compliance. Yet, most of these compounds have multifunctional roles. Xylitol has the added benefit of antimicrobial action. Mannitol prevents structural collapse during freeze-drying (lyoprotector), enhances mechanical properties, accelerates disintegration, and facilitates removal of wafers from molds [43,44]. Another way to deal with unpalatable particles is by coating or encapsulation, as exemplified by the amberlite ion exchange resin in risperidone formulations [45].\nTaste-masking can have the added benefit of drug solubility enhancement, as observed with cyclodextrin (CD)-drug complexation. CDs are soluble cyclic sugars that accommodate hydrophobic drugs\/moieties inside their lipophilic cavities. CDs enhance permeation [46,47] and are approved by the FDA for oral use. As most wafer-based polymers are hydrophilic, drug solubility affects not only dissolution and bioavailability but also drug incorporation\/homogeneity. CD-econazole complexes increased drug solubility by 66-fold, which allowed for solubilization in pectin\/carboxymethylcellulose gels prior to wafer freeze-drying [48]. Although we did not find any other wafers that included this kind of complexation, many buccal films use this complexation technique to enhance solubility. The addition of CD to a polyethylene oxide buccal film increased the release of triamcinolone acetonide in the presence of mucin from 7% to 47% [49].\nAdditional formulation techniques can be used to increase solubility, such as pH modifiers, emulsions, amorphization, co-solvents, solid dispersions, and nanotechnology [50,51]. Curcumin was solubilized in solid lipid nanoparticles prior to dispersion in freeze-dried wafers (\u201csponges\u201d) of polycarbophil. In vivo studies (with 5 adult volunteers) showed a buccal residence time of 15\u202fh and sustained release over 14\u201315\u202fh. However, studies demonstrating permeation or bioavailability were not performed, as the formulation was designed for local treatment of precancerous oral lesions [52]. Finally, another formulation strategy for sustained release is the use of beads. Beads offer a particulate matrix to sustain release and diminish burst effects (initial rapid release). Chitosan lactate beads loaded with tizanidine prevent burst release from chitosan lactate buccal wafers. An in vivo pharmacokinetics study (with six male volunteers) showed a considerable increase in Tmax and an increase in the bioavailability of tizanidine (2.27 folds) compared to those of the immediate release product Sirdalud\u00ae [53].\n\n\n\nProduction process\nThe process to obtain oral wafers has a few steps, as shown in Fig. 3\n. The most critical steps for stability are mixing, freezing and drying. Since many patent technologies perform slight variations of the presented backbone, we discuss some of the particularities along this topic.\nProduction at laboratory scale allows mixing in magnetically stirred beakers [54] with overhead mechanical stirring [32]. However, industrial production requires a temperature-controlled tank and mechanical agitation. The impeller geometry for mixing depends mainly on the rheological properties of the resultant mixture. Low viscosity products can be mixed well by hydrofoil or pitch blades. When working with encapsulated or coated particles, a high shear mixer may disrupt the coating and should be avoided [55]. The target viscosity will depend on the presence of particles and consequent sedimentation rate, as well as disintegrating and mechanical performances. For gelatin-based formulations, patents describe planetary mixers (higher viscosities, low shear) [56,57], but most documents do not provide equipment details.\nGels are dried by lyophilization (or freeze-drying), in which water is removed from the frozen matrix by vacuum sublimation. This technique has many advantages, such as improved stability of thermolabile APIs [58] and final products with high porosity (which allows subsequent gain in loading capacity per weight) [58]. The entire process can occur inside a freeze-drier. As most industrial freeze-driers do not cool below \u221240\u202f\u00b0C, nitrogen tunnels or ultra-freezers can be required for specific freezing processes. Freezing shapes wafers and determines the porosity and surface topology. Therefore, target temperature, rate, and intermediate thermal procedures are entered as settings in advance. Fast rates produce smaller particles and more crystals, which dry slower, resulting in increased drying time. Although slow freezing results in larger crystals, thermal treatments (such as annealing) could result in homogeneity and reduced drying rates [59]. A recent innovation in pharmaceutical freeze-drying processes refers to nucleation control of ice crystals upon freezing. Because nucleation occurs in a wide range of temperature, its occurrence provokes batch heterogeneity and prolonged process. Therefore, inducing simultaneous nucleation can increase product homogeneity and significantly reduce process time\/cost [60]. The technologies with proven scalability to induced nucleation are depressurization, ice fog and temperature quench freezing [61].\nAfter freezing, the product is placed under deep vacuum. Solvent removal occurs in two steps: primary (free solvent removal) and secondary drying (bound solvent removal). The former should start below the collapse temperature (Tc) of the formulation to assure structural integrity and adequate residual moisture. Although biopolymers used in wafers have high Tcs, drugs generally have lower Tc values. Primary drying is time-consuming because bulk water sublimates in larger amounts and at lower temperatures unlike bound solvent. Higher starting temperature results in shorter drying time and lower cost [63]. As such, when Tc is close to or lower than \u221240\u202f\u00b0C, reformulation often occurs. Quicksolv\u00ae patent claims to facilitate drying using a second solvent, which must be miscible with water, present a lower vapor pressure and do not dissolve the other components. However, the patent of the technology does not limit freeze-drying as the only method possible; it is unclear which combinations of claims were really tested and result in optimal formulations [64]. Concerning packaging, the oral lyophilizate fragility demands specific blisters that resist physical stress and humidity [23]. Special packaging is not necessary for modified released forms due to enhanced mechanical strength, but they still need to resist water entrance.\n\n\nQuality attributes and related process\/material parameters\nInternational drug-related agencies recommend the Quality by Design (QbD) approach to assure product quality. Quality, safety, and efficacy must define pharmaceutical product attributes for the intended dose, administration route, and patient profile (Quality Target Product Profile). Then, the identified Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) are correlated with Critical Material Attributes (CMA) and Critical Process Parameters (CPP). Risk analysis and experimental designs help define ranges and actions for CPP\/CMA that produce desired results for the CQAs (design space) [65]. CQAs include physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological properties that may impact product quality depending on its range\/limit\/distribution. Thus, direct or indirect quality control are required. Identification of CPPs relies on a set of tools. Scientific literature and team experience support first conclusions, whereas risk management aids final decisions and further actions [66]. For oral lyophilizates, Table 2\n shows the common CQAs and the most relevant operation units associated with these CQAs [67].\nCPPs relate to process steps that consequently impact CQAs; therefore, they must be well-established and monitored. Fig. 4\n shows process parameters relevant to most common issues in wafer development and production. Cassian and coworkers observed that inadequate mixing time can lead to incomplete polymer hydration. As a result, viscosity may be variable and affect inter\/intra-batch mechanical resistance and disintegration\/dissolution [44]. In addition to process parameters, CMAs affect several quality attributes. For instance, particle size and excipient solubility can influence disintegration and should be specified [14]. In the case of polymorphisms, the final product may disintegrate\/dissolve slower than desired. An evaluation of gelatin-based ODTs demonstrated that low bloom strength and polymer concentration increased disintegration time. This study also showed that some saccharides confer lyoprotection and enhance hardness, but each saccharide had an optimal concentration for effective disintegration of lyophilizates. Mannitol (30\u201340%) was the top filler in this study for 2\u20135% low bloom gelatin gels [72]. Another impact of CMAs relates to process adjustments. Previous studies have demonstrated that PVP can suppress metastable forms of mannitol and eliminate the need for an annealing step in freezing [73].\nStudies on wafer development that use QbD principles are scarce. A recent paper provided a complete assessment, which included risk analysis (Ishikawa-FMEA), D-optimal designs, screening of excipients, and determination of a design space for a blank formulation. These researchers found that alginate\/mannitol formulations had high mechanical strength and disintegration time, whereas xanthan-gum\/mannitol formulations rapidly dispersed, but maintained structural stability [44]. Another interesting study combined formulation with process parameters as the basis for developing a design space. They observed that slow freezing of methylcellulose\/mannitol wafers improved mechanical strength and the dissolution profile of meloxicam [74]. In another study, an experimental design was developed to generate an optimal predicted formulation of low-methoxy amidated pectin\/carboxymethylcellulose wafers to increase mucoadhesitivity. The optimal polymer ratio showed similar performance to the predicted formulation, validating the mathematical approach [43].\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nFreeze-dried wafers can provide immediate or sustained delivery of APIs for local or systemic action. These wafers allow for ease of administration, protection against mechanical removal, and high drug loading. Although production of freeze-dried wafers requires few, inexpensive excipients that are widely available commercially, freeze drying is a high-cost and long process. Therefore, wafers are generally reserved for drugs susceptible to degradation\/crystallization during manufacturing by other methods, or for market product differentiation. Gelatin and xanthan gum are the most commonly used polymers in commercial products and sodium alginate is the most commonly used natural polymer for experimental formulations. Production of wafers requires few steps, mainly mixing and freeze-drying. The wafers are shaped in the freezing step, which is crucial for process cost and time. In addition to process parameters, several material attributes are critical, such as thermal transitions, crystallinity, and hygroscopicity.\nMucoadhesive buccal wafers are typically designed for sustained release and consist of coated APIs and particulate carriers. As this trend is consistent in ODTs and buccal films [75], wafers will probably follow them. The advantage of wafers lies in the process, as the absence of compression and heating stresses protect particles from deformation and aggregation. Development of experimental wafers is increasing within the framework of QbD, a trend based on recent guidelines from regulatory agencies. While few articles detail development of wafers, these studies provide a framework for rational improvements and optimal formula prediction. These studies also highlight the relevance of new excipients, such as chitosan lactate, to augment formulation efficacy. Nevertheless, in vivo experiments have been scarce, and should increase in frequency in the future. Overall, buccal wafers are good candidates as dosage forms for commercial drugs, similar to their fast-disintegrating counterparts. Increasing scientific evidence will help sustained release buccal wafers reach clinical trials, allowing for verification of their performance in humans.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects\n\n\n","1549":"\n\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, there has been continuous development and exploration in the fields of medicine, clinical detection, molecular biology, immunology, and nanotechnology, among others [1\u20136]. There are now higher requirements for the trace analysis of macromolecules and small molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, as well as agricultural and veterinary drugs and environmental pollutants. Traditional immunoassay methods have difficulty in the ultrasensitive detection of proteins, mainly due to the lack of direct amplification techniques, such as PCR. Recently, BCA has become a new technology in various fields, such as clinical diagnosis and trace analysis, and has the advantages of high sensitivity, simple operation and low cost. This technology can be used to realize indirect amplification of a probe and is widely used for the highly sensitive detection of DNA and protein [7\u201310].\nThis ultrasensitive nanoparticle (NP) amplification detection system was originally proposed in 2003 by Mirkin et al. [11] of Northwestern University in the United States for the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The traditional BCA technique uses double-stranded DNA as a bio-barcode, with one strand connected to a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) via a Au-S chain and the other indicating the analyte. The disadvantage of this method is related with poor hybridization, which affects the experimental results to some extent. The method was improved by Thaxton et al. [12] in 2005 via the use of thiol-modified single-stranded DNA instead of double-stranded DNA. The addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) allows the Au-S chain to covalently bind to the DNA on the AuNP, which greatly simplifies the experimental procedure and enhances its quantitative ability.\nAfter more than ten years of exploration and research, BCA technology now has high specificity and ultrahigh sensitivity that is 5\u20136 orders of magnitude higher than that of ELISA [13\u201315]. Compared to PCR, BCA compensates for its complexity, cost, time-consuming nature, labouriousness, and disadvantage of providing only a narrow quantitative range of target DNA after amplification; thus, BCA technology can achieve rapid and efficient trace detection and provide new ideas and platforms for detection in fields related to clinical medicine, food toxins, environmental analysis, and drug detection, among others.\nThis review searched articles from 2003 to 2019 through the Web of Science in English, and the keywords are Bio-barcode assay; Protein; Nucleic acid; Pesticide residues, Biotoxin, etc.\n\n\nThe principle of bio-barcode technology and a method application comparison\nBCA technology is a classic example of nanogold diagnostic technology. AuNP have a high electron density, dielectric and catalytic properties, and may be combined with a variety of biological macromolecules without affecting their biological activity [16,17].\nThe method involves the use of two probes: magnetic beads coated with monoclonal antibodies for the protein, thereby producing a magnetic probe that can adsorb onto the target protein, and AuNP prepared by the trisodium citrate reduction method and coated with anti-target protein antibody and thiol-modified barcode DNA. Then, a magnetic field can be used to form a sandwich-like complex of the two probes with a test sample containing a target protein (e.g., sera, pathogen culture, body fluid) to form \u201cmagnetic microsphere-target protein-AuNP\u201d. After dissociation of the labelled DNA barcode strands on the gold nanoprobes via de-hybridization elution release, the target protein content can be determined by the selected colorimetric, fluorescence labelling, biochip or other detection method [18\u201323]. The main schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1\n.\nSignal amplification detection methods commonly used for the BCA mainly include chip methods [24\u201327], fluorescence labelling methods [28\u201331], colorimetric methods [32\u201334], biosensor methods [35\u201338], and immuno-PCR methods [39\u201342]. Occasionally, DNA barcodes are amplified by a combination of techniques, such as real-time PCR [43\u201345]. BCA technology achieves high sensitivity and simple detection due to multiple signal amplification and the lack of a need for enzyme amplification. This specificity of detection is achieved via monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies corresponding to the target protein. An overview of common signal amplification methods for BCA is shown in Table 1\n.\n\n\nDevelopment and application of bio-barcode detection technology\n\nSingle-residue detection of macromolecules\n\nProtein detection\nProtein is the material basis of human cells and tissues [46], and the detection of protein biomarkers is of great significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, in many early stages of disease, the concentrations of protein markers are considerably low, and conventional ELISA-based methods are not helpful in the diagnosis of various diseases. Traditionally, ELISA-based methods for detecting trace amounts of proteins have been unable to detect protein label concentrations, and their sensitivity has not yet met clinical requirements [47\u201350]. Bio-barcode detection technology is 5\u20136 orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional ELISA, thus making it a highly sensitive and highly specific detection method.\nSince 2003, BCA technology has been applied to detect several protein targets. Georganopoulou et al. [51] used BCA technology for the detection of amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and detected 50 ADDL. Thus, BCA technology can provide a high-sensitivity, high-throughput, rapid, and reliable detection method for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In 2007, Nam et al. [33] used SiO2 microspheres instead of AuNP to modify barcode DNA and antibodies and then detected interleukin 2 (IL-2) by colorimetry. IL-2 is a secreted cytokine that plays a key role in a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and immune diseases. This method detects IL-2 targets as low as 30 aM but does not guarantee reproducibility. Although BCA technology has increased sensitivity and speed, for the maturation of bio-barcode technology, it is also necessary to optimize the relevant experimental parameters. Yin et al. [28] established a method for the specific detection of the blue-tongue virus (BTV) outer nuclear protein VP7 by ultrasensitive BCA technology, which relied on real-time PCR. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.1\u202ffg\/mL, which is 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional ELISA. During the course of the experiment, due to false positives caused by laboratory contamination, multiple washing and cleaning steps are required, and real-time PCR reduces the possibility of DNA contamination to some extent. Zheng et al. [37] used a colorimetric biosensor to rapidly aggregate AuNP and then used smart phone imaging for the detection of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli was determined by the conversion of the colour of AuNP from blue to red. The LOD was 50\u202fCFU\/mL and the method had good specificity and sensitivity but could not meet the LOD of 1\u202fCFU\/mL required for food testing. As such, there is a need to further optimize experimental conditions and increase sensitivity. Li et al. [52] performed the rapid detection and sensitive determination of E. coli O157:H7 bacteria via AuNP labelling and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Because of the signal amplification characteristics of AuNP and the high sensitivity of ICP-MS, the assay was capable of detecting at least 500 E. coli O157:H7 cells in a 1\u202fmL sample. Cui et al. [53] established a sensitive and selective detection method for the H. pylori DNA sequence using a novel bio-barcode-based DNA sensing approach. The DNA sensor exhibited a detection limit of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221215 M. Yin et al. [29] reported the use of real-time quantitative PCR for BCA technology in the specific detection of ricin in water. The method showed a coefficient of variation ranging from 3.39 to 6.84% and an LOD of 1\u202ffg\/mL, which was 6 orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional ELISA. Later, the technology was improved: the sandwich structure was directly subjected to real-time PCR bio-barcode detection reaching an LOD of 0.01\u202ffg\/mL, representing a 100-fold increase in sensitivity. Furthermore, in 2018, Zhang et al. [54] reported a new bio-barcode-based split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay for the sensitive detection of PSA using polymerase-triggered rolling circle amplification, accompanied by the enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation reaction, and the LOD reached as low as 1.8\u202fpg\/mL.\nIn the clinical diagnosis of specific protein markers, chemiluminescence, ELISA, ELISA electrophoresis, and radioimmunoassays are commonly used. However, because early markers of tumours and other disease markers are typically present at trace amounts, the specificity and sensitivity of classic detection methods are insufficient for such clinical tests. In recent years, bio-barcode technology has demonstrated strong sensitivity and specificity through continuous improvements, relying on the combination with various technologies [20,55\u201363]. Zhang et al. [64] developed a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical DNA biosensor for detecting Ag+ based on DNA-Au bio-barcode and silver-enhanced amplification. Since the sandwich hybridization assay format and the silver enhancement have different electrochemical signal amplification linear ranges from 5\u202fpM to 50\u202f\u03bcM and an LOD as low as 2\u202fpM, the method showed good analytical performance for the sensitive transduction of Ag+ recognition. Broto et al. [65] first reported the quantitative analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) in plasma samples. The method can quantify the biomarker in a plasma sample in the range of 900\u201312500\u202fng\/mL with excellent accuracy. The assay can also be used to monitor biomarkers in patients suspected of having or at risk of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or related inflammatory diseases. Xing et al. [66] established a method for the synthesis of novel carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) probes based on hollow quenched gold nanoparticles (HPGNP) and fluorescence quenching. By optimizing the experimental conditions, the LOD reached 1.5\u202fpg\/mL and the linear range of the probe was 2\u2013100\u202fpg\/mL. Narmani et al. [67] established a fluorescence DNA biosensor method based on MMP and NP for the detection of the Vibrio cholera O1 OmpW gene. The results showed that the linear range was from 5 to 250\u202fng\/mL and that the LOD was 2.34\u202fng\/mL. Amini et al. [68] established a method based on two probes and bio-barcode DNA for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus protein A. The results showed that the standard curve was linear from 102 to 107 CFU\/mL and that the LOD for both PBS and real samples was 86\u202fCFU\/mL. Li et al. [69] developed an immunoassay based on tyramine signal amplification (TSA) and AuNP labelling for the highly sensitive detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) by ICP-MS. The LOD was 1.85\u202fpg\/mL, and the linear range was 0.005\u20132\u202fng\/mL. Moreover, the assay showed good repeatability and can be applied to detect other macromolecules in human sera.\n\n\nNucleic acid detection\nNucleic acids are the macromolecules of DNA and RNA and one of the most basic substances required for life [70]. As a standard technique for nucleic acid detection, PCR technology is a highly sensitive method for amplifying specific DNA fragments. However, it relies on enzymatic amplification, requires expensive reagents and is time-consuming [71\u201377]. On the other hand, compared to PCR, BCA technology has achieves high sensitivity, and simple detection while being less time consuming and labour intensive. BCA technology is capable of rapid, low-cost detection and can be applied clinically for the rapid and joint detection of DNA and viruses of epidemic diseases under different conditions.\nWang et al. [26] used chip BCA technology for the detection of trace amounts of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA with a sensitivity of 10\u201315\u202fmol\/L. The detection time was less than 1.5\u202fh, and the test results showed a good linear relationship with the HBV DNA levels and no false-positive results. This method can be used for the rapid screening of HBV DNA and other microbial genes in the serum of hepatitis B patients. Based on high-sensitivity BCA technology, Tang et al. [27] used the chip scanning method to detect HIV-1. The linear range was determined to be from 0.1 to 500\u202fpg\/mL, demonstrating a sensitivity approximately 150 times greater than that of conventional ELISA. Hill et al. [78] first applied bio-barcode technology to detect genomic double-stranded DNA isolated from Bacillus subtilis cells. The core of this approach was the use of blocking oligonucleotides during heat denaturation of the double-stranded DNA. The LOD was 2.5 fM; thus, this method can provide a technical platform for the improvement and development of biological material detection systems. Zhang et al. [30] used BCA technology to detect Salmonella via a fluorescence-based method. The fluorescence signal of the released barcode DNA was exponentially related to the target DNA concentration, and the LOD was 1\u202fng\/mL. Breaking through the traditional microbial culture method used to detect Salmonella will further ensure better food safety control.\nChen et al. [39] developed a functionalized nanogold-enhanced hypersensitivity immuno-PCR method to detect Hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (HNP); the method, based on PCR\/gel electrophoresis and SYBR-Green real-time fluorescence PCR, achieved a LOD of 10\u202ffg\/mL. Li et al. [79] established a triple amplification system based on ICP-MS for the detection of HBV through a combination of nicking-displacement, rolling circle amplification (RCA) and bio-barcode probes. This assay exhibited a LOD of 3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221217 M. As the level of fluorescent PCR increases, ICP-MS technology and experimental methods are also optimized continuously [80\u201387]. In 2017, Yin et al. [88] established a real-time PCR method with a LOD of 1\u202ffg\/mL for the detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antibodies using a TaqMan probe. By improving the method, a 100-fold increase in sensitivity for the detection of HCV was achieved, and the false positives caused by the interference of other DNA sequences were reduced. Zhang et al. [89] developed a hybridized chain reaction (HCR) amplification method combined with AuNP labelling for the ICP-MS-based detection of H9N2 virions. The LOD achieved was 0.12\u202fng\/mL, and the method revealed high specificity and sensitivity. Through optimization of the experimental steps and the technological combinations, the sensitivity of bio-barcode detection technology has been continuously improved, allowing its application to the detection of nucleic acids in various fields.\n\n\nMulti-residue detection of macromolecules\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the bio-barcode DNA strand and the target protein, and the multi-residue analysis of a target substance can be achieved by designing a corresponding DNA barcode based on the capture probe of the target. In other words, BCA technology is capable of the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in one sample.\nIn 2006, Stoeva et al. [90] reported a method using bio-barcoded NP probes for the simultaneous detection of three protein cancer markers: PSA, (a prostate cancer marker); human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG, a testicular cancer marker); and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, a liver cancer marker). The method was performed in a 96-well plate format in a high-throughput manner on buffer or serum samples. The barcodes were detected with the chip-based scanometric method, and with a sensitivity up to fmol\/L. Thus, the technical breakthrough of bio-barcode detection in the field of the multi-residue detection of macromolecular substances has been realized.\nLi et al. [91] labelled DNA with different types of fluorescent dyes and simultaneously detected five sequences and sources of DNA using fluorescently labelled NP-DNA bio-barcodes; the detection limit was 620 aM. The final detection step was completed within 30\u202fs. In 2008, He et al. [92] used a 3730 capillary DNA analyser to detect four viral DNA sequences at concentrations of 5\u202fpmol\/L using bio-barcode detection technology within 40\u202fmin. Lin et al. [31] developed a novel nanoenzyme-based bio-barcode fluorescence amplification assay that can simultaneously detect HIV and HCV DNA. The method mainly used bimetallic (PtAu) NP and showed excellent characteristics, including peroxidase activity for the simultaneous oxidation of non-fluorescent substrates into fluorescent reagents for the simultaneous detection of HIV and HCV genes under both enzyme-free and label-free conditions. Within the range from 10\u202fpM to 500\u202fpM with a regression coefficient of 0.9945, the LOD reached 5\u202fpM. The measured results showed high sensitivity and accuracy. Thus, this approach will also be an important research direction for the simultaneous detection of biological macromolecules.\nThe establishment of multi-residue detection of biological macromolecules is of great significance for clinical disease diagnosis, drug analysis and detection of DNA from pathogens. Currently, technology for the simultaneous detection of biological macromolecules continues to be explored and developed.\n\n\n\n\nSingle-molecule single-residue detection\n\nAgricultural and veterinary drug testing\nSemicarbazide is a hydrazine small-molecule compound that is a metabolite of the veterinary drug nitrofurazone. It is often considered a marker for judging the abuse of nitrofurazone in animal-derived foods. Tang et al. [93] proposed a functional AuNP bio-barcode detection technology for detecting the hapten CPSEM (a nitrofurazone derivative). PCR was combined with indirect competition ELISA to convert the enzyme signal into a DNA signal. The sensitivity reached up to 8\u202fpg\/mL, which is approximately 25 times that of conventional ELISA.\nNanomaterials are less commonly used in the detection of small-substances, such as additives in food and pesticide residues, than macromolecules; one of the main reasons is the structure of small molecules, which cannot bind to two antibodies due to steric hindrance. To solve this problem, the double sandwich structure can be replaced with a competition model [4,94\u201396]. The main schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2\n. Sun et al. [97] developed competitive AuNP that improved real-time immuno-PCR techniques (GNP-rt-IPCR) to detect diethyl phthalate (DEP) in foodstuff samples. By optimizing the experimental conditions, a rather low linearity was achieved within a range from 4\u202fpg\/L to 40\u202fng\/L, and the LOD was 1.06\u202fpg\/L. Zhang et al. [98] detected the small molecule triazophos in water, rice, cucumber, cabbage and apple samples based on a competitive immunoassay with BCA. The method showed a linear range of 0.01\u201320\u202f\u03bcg\/L, and the LOD was 6\u202fng\/L. Du et al. [99,100] established a bio-barcode competitive immunoassay method based on a microplate platform. By designing different DNA strands, the detection of triazophos pesticides was realized. The detection range of this method was from 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122 to 40.0\u202fng\/mL, and the sensitivity was 1.96\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202fng\/mL. As such, this method provides a new direction for the rapid detection and screening of pesticide residues. Competitive colorimetric immunoassays are a new method that makes up for the shortcoming of long-term analysis and expensive equipment for single-residue detection of single-molecule substances in gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and other common detection methods [101\u2013108]. These new methods have promising accuracy and sensitivity and provide broad prospects for the rapid detection of pesticide residues in the environment, agricultural products and foods, as well as the screening of proteins.\n\n\nBiotoxin detection\nYu et al. [109] established a BCA technology for the detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) with a sensitivity of approximately 10\u22128\u202fng\/mL, which is much higher than the sensitivity of ELISA. This work is also the first use of BCA technology for the analysis of AFB1 in herbal medicine. This method can be used for the trace detection of AFB1 in peanuts, cashew nuts and other nut-based foods.\nZhang et al. [110] developed a new high-sensitivity method based on BCA and RCA technology to detect T-2 toxin in food. This method exhibited a LOD of 0.26\u202fpg\/mL, a linear range of 0.002\u2013200\u202fng\/mL, a good recovery and a relative standard deviation of 88.65% to 10.04% and 0.6% to 13.1%, respectively. This method showed potential for the ultrasensitive detection of various small molecules in complex matrices.\n\n\nEnvironmental pollutant detection\nPCB are a class of typical persistent organochlorine compounds that are widely found in the environment, are highly toxic, and bioaccumulate, as they are difficult to degrade; thus, PCB present a major threat to the ecosystem and to human health [111].\nYang et al. [40] established a sensitive immunosorbent bio-barcode detection method based on real-time immuno-PCR to detect 3,4,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrachlorobiphenyl. The linear range was 5\u202fpg\/L-10\u202fng\/L, and the LOD was 1.72\u202fpg\/L. The coefficient of variation was within the specified range; therefore, this method could be used for rapid semi-quantitative PCB detection.\nYang et al. [41] established a bio-barcode method based on real-time immuno PCR for the analysis and detection of PCBs in environmental samples. The lower LOD of this method was 2.55\u202fpg\/L, and the method could successfully detect Aroclor 1248 in seaweed samples collected from the East China Sea in Zhejiang Province. The recovery range was from 84% to 104%. Thus, this method provides a new detection technology for applications in the detection of PCBs.\n\n\nBCA versus other techniques\nCompared with PCR technology, BCA has simple operation and high specificity. It replaces the PCR step with barcode amplification technology, which reduces PCR-related equipment cost and possible pollution. In addition, it does not require enzyme participation, which decreases reagent and transportation costs. The detection range is wide, and the test substance can be detected as long as their corresponding monoclonal antibody and polyclonal antibody can be obtained. Thus, this technology has great advantages in detecting some pathogenic microorganisms that are not suitable for detection by PCR technology. Compared with ELISA technology, BCA has high sensitivity and can be used in combination with the chip method, colorimetric method and fluorescence method. Its sensitivity is 5\u20136 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional ELISA. Moreover, the detection time is at least 3\u202fh less than that of ELISA. Due to insufficient detection sensitivity, ELISA cannot detect certain low-concentration substances and cannot be applied to all samples. In comparison, BCA has a wider detection range. For small-molecule substances, chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, biosensors and other methods are commonly used for detection. However, the price of instruments and equipment for these methods is relatively high. Compared with other methods, the bio-barcode method is simple, inexpensive, specific and sensitive.\n\n\n\nLimitations\nNevertheless, the BCA technology also has some drawbacks. First, in terms of nucleic acid detection, while BCA technology does not require enzymes for amplification, the sensitivity is not superior to that of PCR technology. While the results are reproducible, they can be difficult to accurately quantify, and false positives can be a problem. For example, there are certain false positives in the silver staining reaction, and other methods, such as the colorimetric method and fluorescent labelling method that can be used for quantitative detection. Further exploration is needed to optimize the experimental conditions and operating procedures to further improve the detection sensitivity. In some detection methods, barcode DNA needs to be amplified by PCR, or the amplified barcode is subjected to electrophoresis or chip detection by combined technology. In these cases, detection relies on expensive equipment, which limits the widespread application of these methods in practice. Second, BCA technology has been applied for the multi-residue detection of macromolecules but not small molecules, which could be an important direction for future exploration. Third, the reagents and materials required for bio-barcode-based experiments are easier to prepare than those needed for other detection methods, and their specificity also depends on the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies used in the detection system; however, the relatively high cost of commercial monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies will affect the application of this technology in actual detection. The preparation of test kit products and promotion of their use are also an important research direction. Fourth, the preparation of probes takes a long time, as the experimental preparation of some probes require 72\u202fh or more; therefore, the reaction needs to be optimized to further shorten the preparation and detection time.\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nIn this review, we introduced the directions and applications of several bio-barcode detection assays. After more than ten years of development and exploration, BCA technology has enabled the establishment of a simple and reliable high-efficiency system for the single-residue or multi-residue detection of macromolecular substances, such as proteins, and the single-residue detection of small molecules. As they have high sensitivity and specificity, these methods have demonstrated strong advantages for applications in clinical disease diagnosis, food safety testing, and chemical contaminant testing.\nFirst, the nanomaterials used in bio-barcode detection technology are safe and not easily denatured by binding to target molecules; in addition, the high specificity and high sensitivity allow broad application prospects. Second, BCA technology can design barcode DNA of different lengths and sequences according to different targets to complete multi-residue detection. Third, compared with chromatographic methods and other detection methods, it is cost-effective, fast and simple in the single-residue detection of small molecules.\nBCA technology is not yet fully mature, and each component of a method may affect its sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, exploring the optimal reaction conditions, reducing the testing costs, further simplifying the operation steps, improving the detection sensitivity, shortening the time of preparation and testing, realizing the detection of multiple substances in the same reaction system, and developing and commercializing BCA technology-based immunization kits are important directions for future research.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1550":"\n\nIntroduction\nGemcitabine and gemcitabine-based strategies are the standard chemotherapies for treating advanced tumors that are detected in the breast, lung or pancreas [1\u20133]. Unfortunately, in contrast to the overall declining trends of breast and lung cancer, the death rates of pancreatic cancer rose 0.3% per year from 2011 to 2015 [4]. Moreover, for patients with a late stage of pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate is only 3% [4]. Therefore, it is important to develop novel strategies to fight pancreatic cancer.\nOne promising drug for the treatment of cancer is LW6, which was originally reported to inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 activity [5,6]. Unfortunately, there is no evidence if this drug is beneficial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer or if this drug can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine.\nA key process that has been reported to regulate the pathophysiology of cancer and the sensitivity to chemotherapy is macroautophagy (autophagy) [7,8]. It is recognized as a regulated process that degrades damaged organelles and molecules in order to recycle necessary nutrients. Several studies have demonstrated that upregulated autophagy in pancreatic cancer enhances the tumor progression and has cytoprotective effects when chemotherapeutics, such as gemcitabine and fluorouracil, are applied [7,9\u201311]. Recently, multiple studies have suggested that inhibition of autophagy might be used as an anti-cancer strategy [12\u201314].\nThus, the present study evaluated whether the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine is a promising approach to treat pancreatic cancer. In addition, this study also investigated if LW6 enhances chemosensitivity to gemcitabine via the inhibition of autophagic flux.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nCell culture and reagents\nThe murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line 6606PDA (a gift from Prof. Tuveson at the University of Cambridge, UK) and the MIA PaCa-2 cell line (human pancreatic cancer cell line purchased from ATCC, Manassas, USA) were cultured in the medium as reported previously [15]. To mimic hypoxic conditions, the cells were cultured in an Innova CO-48 incubator (New Brunswick Scientific Co, Edison, USA) with a 1% oxygen supply [15]. LW6 was purchased from Merck Millipore (Eschborn, Germany, code 400083) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 25\u202fmM. Gemcitabine and chloroquine (CQ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA, with the codes G6423 and PHR1258, respectively) and were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 25\u202fmM or 50\u202fmM, respectively. All these solutions were stored at \u221220\u202f\u00b0C.\n\n\nWestern blotting\nFor western blots, 2.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells per well were plated in a 6-well plate. After 24\u202fh, the cells were treated with the appropriate drug for distinct time periods. In addition, in experiments analyzing autophagic flux with CQ, the cells were treated for a maximum of 6\u202fh just before the harvest of the cells. The western blots were performed as previously described [16] using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA, code L7543, dilution: 1000\u00d7), rabbit anti-p62\/SQSTM1 (p62, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, code ab 109012, dilution: 8000\u00d7), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA, code 9661, dilution: 1000\u00d7), mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA, code A5441, dilution: 20000\u00d7), peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA, code 7074, dilution: 10000\u00d7) or peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA, code A9044, dilution: 60000\u00d7). The ratios of LC3II\/\u03b2-actin and p62\/\u03b2-actin were determined using a Chemi-Doc XRS System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany) and are presented as the mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviation (SD).\n\n\nEvaluation of tandem RFP-GFP-targeted LC3 fluorescence\nTo perform this assay, 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 6606PDA cells per well or 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 MIA PaCa-2 cells per well were plated in a glass-bottom dish (NEST, Wuxi, China, code 801001). On the following day, the cells were transfected with the ptfLC3 plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge, UK, code 21074), which was a kind gift from Tamotsu Yoshimori [17], and Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA, code L3000001). After 24\u202fh, the cells were treated with medium containing DMSO (Sham) or LW6 (80\u202f\u00b5M for MIA PaCa-2, 160\u202f\u00b5M for 6606PDA) for another 12\u202fh and then were fixed with 4% formalin. The nuclei were stained with 4\u20326-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The images were acquired by a confocal microscope, Zeiss LSM 780 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), using the 60\u00d7 oil objective. Only cells that were transfected with the ptfLC3 plasmid were evaluated. To evaluate the ratio of autophagosomes\/cell in each field, the following formula was used: autophagosomes\/cell\u202f=\u202fthe number of yellow dots\/the number of nuclei. Similarly, the ratio of autolysosomes\/cell was defined as the number of red dots divided by the number of nuclei in each field. For each experiment, five fields per treatment were randomly acquired and evaluated.\n\n\nAnalysis of cell proliferation and cell death\nFor the evaluation of proliferation, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 6606PDA cells per well or 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 MIA PaCa-2 cells per well were seeded into a 96-well plate. After 24\u202fh, the cells were treated with medium containing DMSO (Sham) or with therapeutic agents as indicated in each figure. The cell proliferation was evaluated after 30\u202fh by quantifying the incorporation of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) with the colorimetric Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany, code 11647229001) and the Perkin Elmer Victor X3 model 2030 Multilabel Plate Reader platform (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA).\nTo analyze cell death, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f104 6606PDA or MIA PaCa-2 cells per well were plated in a 24-well plate. On the following day, these cells were treated for 48\u202fh with medium containing DMSO (Sham) or with the appropriate drug as indicated in each figure. Trypsinized and resuspended cells were stained with a trypan blue staining solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA, code 15250-061), and the percentage of dead cells was determined with the help of a Neubauer chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in a blinded fashion.\n\n\nSyngeneic orthotopic carcinoma model\nTo evaluate the tumor weight, a 5\u202f\u03bcl cell suspension that contained 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 6606PDA cells was injected into the pancreas of C57BL\/6J mice in accordance with the European Directive (2010\/63\/EU), and this procedure was approved by the local animal care committee (Landesamt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). The details of the syngeneic orthotopic carcinoma model have been described in our previous study [18]. Blood samples for evaluating the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alanine transaminase (AST) were taken before the euthanasia of mice. Then, the ALT and AST activities were analyzed in the blood plasma using the Cobas c111 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nIn Fig. 1\n, the data are presented as the mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD, and a two-way analysis of variance (with an inclusive Bonferroni test for post hoc comparison) was used to determine the significant differences in cell proliferation when the cells were cultured in hypoxic and normoxic conditions. In the other figures, the data are presented as the median (25th percentile and 75th percentile), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. In graphs that compare more than two groups, the differences were only considered to be significant when the P-value was lower than 0.05 divided by the number of meaningful comparisons (in order to correct for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction) [19].\n\n\n\nResults\n\nLW6 inhibits proliferation and induces cell death in vitro\n\nTo clarify, if hypoxia is necessary to investigate the anti-cancer effects of LW6, 6606PDA and MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Surprisingly, the inhibition of cell proliferation by LW6 was not influenced by the oxygen supply (Fig. 1). Thus, the following experiments were performed under normoxic conditions.\nTo investigate the anti-cancer effects of LW6, the proliferation and cell death of 6606PDA and MIA PaCa-2 cells were analyzed. In both cell lines, LW6 inhibited proliferation (Fig. 2\nA and 2B) and induced cell death (Fig. 2C and D) in a dose-dependent manner. In 6606PDA and MIA PaCa-2 cells, the application of 80\u202f\u00b5M and 160\u202f\u00b5M LW6 significantly inhibited cell proliferation compared to Sham-treated or 40\u202f\u00b5M LW6-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). In 6606PDA cells, these concentrations of LW6 also significantly increased cell death (Fig. 2C). In addition, LW6 had more efficient cytotoxic effects on MIA PaCa-2 cells than on 6606PDA cells. A dose of 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 killed almost 84% of the MIA PaCa-2 cells within 48\u202fh (Fig. 2D). Thus, in the following experiment, 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 was applied to 6606PDA cells, and 40\u202f\u00b5M LW6 was applied to MIA PaCa-2 cells.\n\n\nLW6 enhances chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in vitro\n\nTo analyze the feasibility of using LW6 in combination with traditional chemotherapeutics, the cell proliferation and cell death were evaluated after treating distinct pancreatic cancer cell lines with LW6 plus gemcitabine. Both monotherapies, 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 or 0.05\u202f\u00b5M gemcitabine, significantly inhibited the proliferation of 6606PDA cells compared to the proliferation of the Sham-treated cells (Fig. 3\nA). Moreover, LW6 plus gemcitabine significantly inhibited the proliferation of 6606PDA cells compared to the proliferation of the Sham-treated cells or of cells treated separately with each monotherapy (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained after treating MIA PaCa-2 cells with 40\u202f\u00b5M LW6 plus 0.05\u202f\u00b5M gemcitabine (Fig. 3B).\nIn addition, monotherapy with either 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 or 0.05\u202f\u00b5M gemcitabine significantly induced 6606PDA cell death (Fig. 3C) and increased the accumulation of cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 4\nA) compared to those of the Sham-treated cells. Moreover, the combined therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine also significantly induced 6606PDA cell death (Fig. 3C) and increased the accumulation of cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 4A) compared to those of the Sham-treated cells or those of cells treated with each monotherapy. Very similar results were obtained with MIA PaCa-2 cells when using the trypan blue assay. The application of 40\u202f\u00b5M LW6 or 0.05\u202f\u00b5M gemcitabine significantly increased the levels of MIA PaCa-2 cell death compared to that of Sham-treated cells (Fig. 3D). In addition, the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine also significantly induced cell death compared to the cell death induced by either the Sham treatment or treatment with each monotherapy (Fig. 3D). However, LW6 failed to increase the accumulation of cleaved caspase 3 compared to that of the Sham-treated cells, and LW6 reduced gemcitabine-induced cleavage of caspase 3 in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4B).\n\n\nLW6 in combination with gemcitabine impairs pancreatic cancer in vivo\n\nTo confirm the in vitro results, the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine was evaluated using a syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic cancer model (Fig. 5\nA). Treatment with LW6 plus gemcitabine reduced the tumor volume and weight compared to treatment with LW6 or gemcitabine monotherapy (Fig. 5B and C). This combination therapy also significantly reduced the tumor weight compared to the tumor weight of Sham-treated mice (Fig. 5C). The liver toxicity of each monotherapy as well as the combination therapy was also analyzed. Each therapy failed to significantly increase the activities of AST (Fig. 5D) and ALT (Fig. 5E) in the blood.\n\n\nLW6 inhibits autophagic flux and enhances chemosensitivity to gemcitabine\nTo evaluate if and how autophagy might be involved in the observed synergism between LW6 and gemcitabine, LC3II and p62, two key proteins involved in autophagy, were analyzed. First, the influence of gemcitabine on autophagic flux was assessed. Gemcitabine had no major influence on the accumulation of LC3II and failed to decrease the accumulation of p62, when treating 6606PDA cells for 3\u202fh (Fig. 6\nA), 6\u202fh (Fig. 6B) and 12\u202fh (Fig. 6C). This suggests that gemcitabine does not induce autophagic flux within 12\u202fh. However, when blocking autophagic flux with CQ, LC3II and p62 accumulated in 6606PDA cells (Fig. 6A\u2013C). Interestingly, inhibition of autophagic flux by CQ (Fig. 6A\u2013C) increased the chemosensitivity of 6606PDA cells to gemcitabine (Fig. 6D) in a similar manner as has been demonstrated with LW6 (Fig. 3A).\nIn order to evaluate, if and how LW6 influences the autophagic flux, the accumulation of LC3II and p62 was analyzed. We observed that 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 induced the accumulation of LC3II in a time-dependent manner in 6606PDA cells as well as MIA PaCa-2 cells, with the strongest induction at 12\u202fh (Fig. 7\nA and B). Moreover, LW6 also induced the accumulation of LC3II in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (Fig. 7C and D). Similar to LC3II, p62 also accumulated after treating the cells with LW6 (Fig. 7E and F). LW6 inhibited the accumulation of LC3II and p62 in a similar manner to CQ, a traditional inhibitor of autophagic flux after 6\u202fh (Fig. 8\nA) as well as 12\u202fh (Fig. 8B). In addition, CQ in combination with LW6 failed to increase the accumulation of LC3II and p62, when compared to cells treated by LW6 monotherapy (Fig. 8). These data demonstrate that 80\u202f\u00b5M LW6 completely blocks autophagic flux leading to increased accumulation of LC3II and p62.\nTo reaffirm that LW6 inhibits autophagic flux, tandem RFP-GFP-tagged LC3 plasmids were transfected into cancer cells. In transfected 6606PDA and MIA PaCa-2 cells, autophagosomes and autolysosomes were identified based on their yellow or red fluorescence (Fig. 9\nA and B). Careful quantification demonstrated that LW6 significantly increased the number of autophagosomes and significantly decreased the number and percentage of autolysosomes in both cancer cell lines (Fig. 9C and D). These results confirmed that LW6 inhibited autophagic flux. In addition, the accumulation of LC3II and p62 were measured to determine if LW6 blocked autophagic flux in gemcitabine-treated cells. Indeed, LW6 increased the accumulation of LC3II and p62 in the absence and the presence of gemcitabine (Fig. 10\nA). Also in the presence of CQ, a minor increase in the accumulation of LC3II and p62 was observed after LW6 treatment (Fig. 10B). All these data suggest that LW6 impaired autophagic flux and enhanced the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine (Fig. 11\n).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nFor the first time, the present study demonstrated that LW6 combined with gemcitabine was beneficial in treating pancreatic cancer. In addition, this study also characterized a completely novel mechanism of action for LW6: the inhibition of autophagic flux.\nTo evaluate if LW6 regulates autophagic flux, we analyzed LC3II, p62, autolysosomes and autophagosomes in murine and human pancreatic cancer cell lines. The data demonstrated that LW6 caused the accumulation of LC3II, p62 and autophagosomes (Figs. 7\u20139), whereas it decreases the number of autolysosomes (Fig. 9). All these results demonstrate that LW6 inhibited autophagic flux. In addition, we followed the guideline of monitoring autophagy to evaluate the drugs in combination with traditional inhibitors of autophagy such as CQ [20]. An additive or supra-additive effect in LC3-II levels may indicate that the drug enhances autophagic flux [20]. A drug, which increases the level of LC3-II on its own, but which induces a similar LC3-II level in the presence of CQ, when compared to the drug alone, may completely block autophagy [20]. Such an experiment was executed and the data also support the concept that LW6 inhibits the autophagic process (Fig. 8). Although the experiments were performed following the guidelines for monitoring autophagy [20] and assessed autophagy with these three assays, there were still technical limitations. For example, LC3II is expressed in a tissue- and cell context-dependent manner and may also be associated with the membranes of non-autophagic structures [21\u201323]. A relatively stable indicator to determine autophagy is p62. However, its accumulation can sometimes be regulated independent of autophagy [24,25]. In spite of these minor limitations, the present study demonstrates that LW6 inhibits autophagic flux. LW6 might block autophagic flux between the maturation of autophagosomes and the formation of autolysosomes [26].\nIn general, many studies agree that gemcitabine can induce autophagic flux [27\u201330], although we could not get convincing data that supports such an induction in 6606PDA cells (Fig. 6). However, it is controversial if gemcitabine-induced autophagy is cytoprotective or cytotoxic for pancreatic cancer cells. On the one hand, two studies have demonstrated that gemcitabine can induce cytotoxic autophagy [27,28]. These studies relied on 3-methyladenine (3-MA) as an autophagic inhibitor, and it is well documented that 3-MA treatment can also induce autophagy [31]. Thus, several studies and the guidelines suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting data that rely on 3-MA to block autophagy [20,31,32]. On the other hand, many studies have demonstrated that gemcitabine-induced autophagy has a cytoprotective effect in pancreatic cancer cells [7,11\u201313,33]. The results of the present study are consistent with the concept that the inhibition of autophagy enhances the sensitivity to gemcitabine (Fig. 6). A randomized phase II trial that is assessing the inhibition of autophagy in combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane is still ongoing (NCT01978184). This trial might clarify if the inhibition of autophagy is beneficial for cancer patients.\nSo far, no study has investigated the role of LW6 in pancreatic cancer. The present in vitro data demonstrate that LW6 can inhibit proliferation and can induce cell death in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2). However, LW6 monotherapy leads only to a minor reduction of tumor weight in vivo (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine did not only impair the proliferation and viability of cancer cells in vitro (Fig. 3) but also significantly reduced the tumor weight in vivo (Fig. 5C). Gemcitabine is still the first-line chemotherapy to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer is often refractory to gemcitabine and, therefore, has a poor prognosis. For the first time, the present study demonstrates that LW6 enhances the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in vitro and in a syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic carcinoma model. In addition, it suggests that LW6 enhances the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine by inhibiting autophagic flux (Fig. 11). This hypothesis is consistent with several previous studies, which have suggested that blocking autophagy strengthens the tumoricidal effect of gemcitabine [7,11\u201313]. However, it is unlikely that the inhibition of autophagic flux is the only way that LW6 increases the sensitivity to gemcitabine. Regulating other processes, such as tumor immunity [6] and cell metabolism [34,35], by LW6 might also enhance the anti-cancer effects of gemcitabine [36]. Thus, it was worth to evaluate the anti-cancer effect of LW6 and LW6 plus gemcitabine in vivo since inhibition of several pathways might be superior to an inhibition of only autophagy.\nAlthough several publications have suggested that the inhibition of autophagy in addition to traditional chemotherapy may be a successful strategy [11,12], the following questions still need to be answered: Does the inhibition of autophagy in addition to traditional chemotherapy truly benefit the patient? How do distinct drugs that inhibit autophagy compare to each other in their efficacy? Are some drugs especially useful because they not only inhibit autophagy but also interfere with other physiological processes that regulate cell survival and proliferation?\n\n\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this study proposes that LW6 may represent a novel drug to inhibit autophagic flux in cancer cells (Fig. 11). This study also suggests that the combination therapy of LW6 plus gemcitabine might be promising and should, therefore, be evaluated on various cancer entities in preclinical as well as clinical studies.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n","1551":"\n\nIntroduction\nLaparoscopy has become the surgical treatment of choice for several benign pathologies [1]. It has many advantages, such as magnification of the pelvis, short hospitalisation, rapid recovery, low rate of infection, and good cosmetic results [2\u20134]. Additionally, hysterectomy is one of the most common gynaecological procedures, with approximately 600,000 hysterectomies performed per year in the US [5]. Laparoscopic subtotal\/supracervical hysterectomy (LASH) is a surgical option when hysterectomy is indicated in the absence of cervical or endometrial malignant pathology [6]. This technique has many advantages, such as low perioperative morbidity, and faster postoperative recovery [7]. However, leiomyoma is still the most common indication for hysterectomy [8,9]. Both LASH and laparoscopic myomectomy are surgical procedures that could be proposed in cases of uterine myoma, depending on the patient\u2019s age and their wish to preserve fertility. Both techniques require laparoscopic tissue extraction through small incisions to avoid the need for a mini-laparotomy. Intra-abdominal fragmentation is performed with the use of a morcellator. Since 1993, with the development of the Steiner morcellator [10], several systems of electromechanical morcellation have become available. A rapidly circulating sharp cylinder with a coring knife\/cutter at its intra-abdominal end is placed inside the trocar sleeve and is rotated by an electrical micro-engine attached to the trocar. Cylindrical tissue blocks are cut out of the main specimen in a stepwise fashion and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the cannula [11]. Morcellation can induce different sizes of tissue specimens. Fragments that are microscopic or even larger may be unnoticed and may remain in the abdominal cavity, tract incisions, or trocars, resulting in the appearance of an unrecognized pathology such as iatrogenic parasitic myoma (IPM) [12] or iatrogenic adenomyoma (IA) [2,13\u201316].\nThe incidence of retained uterine fragments remains unknown because this complication of morcellation is underestimated due to the small series and because the majority of such pathologies are published as case reports. In the largest series, the incidence of IPMwas 1.2% [17], and that of IA was 0.57% [13]. In the Van der Meulen et al. [18] review, the incidence was 0.12% to 0.94%. The majority of case reports and series have been published in the last few decades after electromechanical morcellator introduction. Many types of morcellators (motor coring, motor peeling, or bipolar cutting as the working principle) with four types of blade diameters (12, 13, 15, and 20\u202fmm) and increased morcellation rates (6.2\u201340.4\u202fg\/min) [19] were available from 1993 to 2014 (after the FDA warning concerning morcellator use) [20]. Following this communication regarding power morcellation, the utilization of minimally invasive hysterectomy and morcellation decreased. However, asymptomatic cases of IPM are not reported, and these cases will likely be diagnosed and reported in the next period.\nThis article aimed to review the literature on parasitic myoma and adenomyoma and to compare these diseases in terms of clinical, paraclinical, surgical, and prognostic factors. Available articles were reviewed using PubMed\/ MEDLINE and ScienceDirect resources, and the differences between these two entities were analysed. Thirty-six cases of IPM (13 case reports and 5 case series) and 10 cases of IA (2 case reports and one series) were found (Fig. 1\n).\n\n\nParasitic myoma [12,15,16,21\u201334]\n\nMyoma was the initial surgical indication for myomectomy or hysterectomy in all cases of IPM, except in 3 cases in which the initial indication of hysterectomy was not stated. In 7 of 10 cases (70%), when the myoma location was indicated, a posterior location in the uterine wall was cited. Myomectomy was performed for large uterine myomas (>5 cm) in all cases when their size was described (fibroids measuring 8.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.2\u202fcm). A myoma size exceeding 6\u202fcm was described in 9 cases (29%); in 25 cases, the data were not available, and in 2 cases, the myoma size was measured at 5\u202fcm (Table 1\n). The initial surgical procedure (myomectomy\/hysterectomy) was performed by laparoscopy in 88.8% of cases (n\u202f=\u202f32) and by laparotomy in 11% of cases (n\u202f=\u202f4) in women aged 23\u201350\u202fyears. In the laparoscopic group, 78.8% (n\u202f=\u202f25) of the procedures were myomectomies, whereas 21.8% (n\u202f=\u202f7) were hysterectomies (3 cases of total hysterectomy and 4 cases of subtotal hysterectomy). When the laparoscopic approach was performed, an electromechanical morcellator was used in 90% of cases (n\u202f=\u202f29). In the other 3 cases, manual morcellation with a cold knife was performed. Manual morcellation was described even in the abdominal approach (n\u202f=\u202f3). The interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of IPM or IA varied depending on symptoms. For asymptomatic cases, the average time was longer (6.2\u202fyears) than that for the symptomatic case (4.2\u202fyears). In the Kho and Nezat [29] series, the average time between the previous abdominal surgery and surgery during which an IPM was diagnosed was 75\u202fmonths. In this review overall, 63.8% of patients presenting with IMP were asymptomatic at the time of the diagnosis, while Van der Meulen et al. [35] reported that 21.7% of patients were asymptomatic, in both parasitic myoma and adenomyoma cases. Common symptoms of IPM include abdominal discomfort, fatigue, backache, dyspareunia, and urinary\/bowel complaints.\nThere was no relationship between the size of IPM and symptomatic patients, as asymptomatic cases were described with 8\u201310-cm parasitic myomas [12,23,30], and a 15-mm parasitic myoma was described as causing pelvic or abdominal pain [17]. Pain was usually described in cases of IPM located in the pelvic region [15,16,26]. These iatrogenic lesions were identified by vaginal ultrasound and more accurately by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Masses similar to uterine myoma were observed in the cases of IPM.\nThe location of these iatrogenic pathologies may be on any abdominal organ or peritoneal area, especially if an electromechanical morcellator is used. However, the majority of IPMs were found in the pelvis (67.7%), along the gastrointestinal tract, and less frequently in the upper abdomen, along the urinary tract, or along the trocar or abdominal scar. Cuccinela et al. [17] identified the pelvic location of IPMs by movement of the fragments to the lower part of the abdomen. Kho and Nezhat [29] noted that the most likely locations of IPMs are in the pelvis. The number of IPMs varies depending on the type of morcellation. After mechanical morcellation, one lesion is usually cited. In cases in which an electrical morcellator is used, the number can reach up to seven or more. This difference could be explained by the fact that when manual morcellation is used, the tissue fragments are larger and can be seen easily, which is not the case in electromechanical morcellation due to the force of the rotating blade, causing very small fragments to be dispersed away from the field. The size of nodules varies from 3\u202fmm to 30\u202fcm.\nConcerning intraoperative macroscopic analysis of the lesions, the majority of IPMs were not described as causing an inflammatory reaction or adhesions (69.2%, n\u202f=\u202f18\/26 of available data). In two case reports and in one series, there were no available data regarding the adhesions. All cases of IPM were confirmed by histological findings to be composed only of smooth muscles (Table 2\n). The pathogenesis of IPM is still not clearly understood. Pieces of the endometrium, such as the myometrium, can implant and proliferate [36]. According to Kho and Nezat [29], the greater risk factor for the development of parasitic myomas is the presence of a uterine leiomyoma. It was shown that myomas >6.5\u202fcm had a significantly higher proportion of abnormal karyotypes than myomas <6.5\u202fcm (75% vs. 34%) and subsequently more mitotic activity [37,38]. This finding suggests that small fragments coming from a myoma that is >6.5\u202fcm could have a higher implantation and growth potential. In this review, 29% (9 cases) of the laparoscopic myomectomies that were performed were for fibroids >6\u202fcm, whereas in 2 cases, the size of the fibroid was <6\u202fcm; in 20 cases, no data were provided. A posterior location of uterine myomas was frequently described for the previous laparoscopic myomectomy, and this position may have made the surgical intervention more difficult, contributing to the formation of IPMs.\nAs with uterine myoma [39], the theory of response to injury may explain the pathogenesis of IPM. Experimental data on mice showed that primary myoma cells are able to form xenograft tumour. Associated stromal cells, such as myoma-derived fibroblasts or microvasculature endothelial cells, could account for tumour formation by providing a supportive tumour stroma or a microvascular network [40]. Huang et al. [41] suggested that increased angiogenesis and cell proliferation occur in implanted xenografted myomas (compared with primary myomas) and are involved in the pathogenesis of iatrogenic myomas.\nKho and Nezat [29] described the parasitic myoma as follows: after administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which restricts blood supply to the myoma, a subserosal or pedunculated myoma may lose its uterine blood supply and parasitise to an adjacent organ. In the review of Van der Meulen et al. [18], the duration of steroid exposure seems to be a risk factor that contributes to the development of either IPM or IA. All patients in this review had a premenopausal status at the time of the first surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy). Even if leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata is described after a surgical procedure, it may not be an iatrogenic condition. In this pathology, the pathogenesis differs from the clinical picture, and the evolution is different from IPM. Regarding this pathology that developed after a surgical procedure, in the majority of cases, morcellation was not performed; other theories could explain this pathology as being caused by hormonal or genetic factors [42]. Even in asymptomatic patients, removal of this iatrogenic pathology is necessary because the risk of malignant transformation is higher than that with uterine myoma (2\u20135% [43] versus 2.33\u20133.6 per 1000 hysterectomies for uterine myoma [44]), as genetic disorders in this tumour are more frequent.\n\n\nIatrogenic adenomyoma [13\u201315]\n\nAll described cases of IA (n\u202f=\u202f10) were found after total (n\u202f=\u202f1) or subtotal hysterectomy (n\u202f=\u202f9) with morcellation (Table 3\n). The hysterectomy was performed for a large uterus with myomas or a large uterus with myomas and adenomyosis weighing 211.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fg in women aged 39\u201348\u202fyears. The average interval between hysterectomy and symptoms of IA varied within 7.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.03\u202fyears. Common symptoms of IA included abdominal discomfort, moderate-to-severe deep dyspareunia, and pelvic mass. Pelvic pain was described in all cases, mostly due to the existence of adhesions and nerve involvement. Dyspareunia was another common symptom in patients with this entity, explained by rectal retraction and the presence of adhesions. Clinical examination was painful when the pouch of Douglas and lateral Cul-de-sac were explored, and vaginal examination showed the presence of retrocervical or laterocervical masses. The preoperative blood sample analysis showed elevated CA 125 in 9 cases (90%). Pelvic MRI showed an irregular mass overhanging the cervix, extending up into the pelvis, pressing against the rectum or rectosigmoid, or a pelvic mass fixed to the vaginal vault. These heterogeneous masses were composed of hypo- and hyperintense signals on T2-weighted images. Gadolinium injection evidenced vascularisation of the lesions. Hyperintense signals on T1-weighted images with saturation of fatty tissue suggested the presence of old blood.\nLaparoscopic excision was proposed for patients with retrocervical masses filling the pouch of Douglas. The number of lesions varied between 1 and 2, which was not the case for IPM, which had seven lesions in one case. The iatrogenic nodule size measured 34.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f28.7\u202fmm. Despite the use of an electromechanical morcellator in the case of IA masses, the usual location was in the pelvic area, especially in the retrocervical zone. A macroscopic inflammatory reaction was observed, creating retraction of the surrounding organs, such as the cervix and rectum. Adhesions between the pelvic masses and the rectum were found in all cases. Extensive dissection of the rectum and pararectal fossa were required to isolate the lesions. During resection of the masses, bluish lesions were identified corresponding to haemorrhagic spots observed on MRI. In the physiology of adhesion formation, the inflammatory process is commonly implicated [45], and adenomyosis is associated with a more inflammatory reaction than uterine fibroids. Additionally, the junctional zone is more inflammatory for the peritoneum. In peritoneal endometriosis, according to Sampson\u2019s theory, viable endometrial cells are able to implant, proliferate and create an inflammatory reaction [46]. The experimental baboon model confirmed these data with more adhesions after grafting the endometrium or endometrium and junctional zone, as the inflammatory response is more important in IAs than in myomatous lesions [13]. Histological examination of the excised iatrogenic lesions confirmed smooth muscle hyperplasia infiltrated by endometrial glands and stroma. An inflammatory reaction was also observed around the dilated glands, probably due to old blood retention in the lumen of these glands (Table 4\n).\nConcerning IA, all cases were described after morcellation of an adenomyotic uterus. We thus agreed with Donnez et al. [36] that retained uterine fragments containing both endometrium and myometrium are able to survive in the peritoneal cavity, resulting in adenomyotic lesions. The most important difference between IPMs and IAs is the presence of endometrium associated with subendometrial myometrium (junctional zone). When this association is found in forgotten specimens, these iatrogenic lesions are able to develop tumours characterised by dense tissue composed of smooth muscle hyperplasia with isolated foci of endometrial mucosa and stroma. Experimental studies conducted by Donnez et al. [36] on baboons showed that 20\u201324\u202fmonths after grafting of the myometrium alone, smooth muscle lesions associated with fibrotic tissue were found in all cases except one. After grafting the endometrium together with the junctional zone and total uterine thickness, novel lesions composed of endometrial glands and stroma associated with smooth muscle hyperplasia were found. Induced nodular endometriotic lesions were significantly larger and showed a stronger invasion process when tissue specimens containing the junctional zone were grafted. Adenomyosis was the initial indication for LASH in the Donnez et al. [36] series, which means that the junctional zone was larger with a higher risk of having more junctional zone fragments able to induce the formation of iatrogenic adenomyosis. Based on an experimental model [47], the adhesion of human endometrial cells to mouse peritoneum was increased by treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, and surgical intervention creates an inflammatory reaction because of peritoneal damage, crush-induced ischaemia, suture ligation, coagulation, or CO2 use [45].\nIn cases of uterine morcellation, both types of iatrogenic lesions may develop, but IA lesions were more commonly described. The duration of steroid exposure seems to be a risk factor in the case of IPM, and all patients were in the premenopausal period at the time of first surgery. Removal of this iatrogenic pathology is necessary because of the risk of malignant transformation. Rabischong [48] described one case with atypical endometrial hyperplasia as an initial pathology without this atypia. Methods to avoid these iatrogenic complications may include laparoscopic morcellation in a bag, as suggested by Kanade et al. [49], or culdotomy or mini-laparotomy with manual morcellation within a specimen bag [50]. There are no limitations of in-bag morcellation, with the possibility of use even with single-site access. Morcellation in a bag is proposed for myomas and for the uterus and does not require additional advanced surgical skills. In cases of uterine morcellation (subtotal or total hysterectomy), the use of a bag may systematically include conditions without anatomopathological modifications, such as uterine prolapse [51]. In 2016, the FDA approved the first bag for contained morcellation [52]. However, an in vitro study demonstrated that the risk of leakage and tissue dissemination still exists, depending on the insufflation pressure and material type of the bag [53], and the case of S\u00fcleyman Salman confirmed this issue [54]. Another in vivo study showed that some types of bags seem to be safe [55,56], but the existing bags were not designed for power morcellation and, thus, risk spillage in the case of multiport laparoscopy. The authors of that study suggested that the absence of leakage be assessed by visual inspection. Akdemir et al. [57] proposed the use of surgical gloves for enclosed morcellation in cases of multiport laparoscopy to decrease tissue spillage, but the myoma size is a limiting factor for this in-bag morcellation technique. In addition to the concern of spreading malignant cells, morcellation raises new challenges in the pathological interpretation of disrupted tissue specimens. Pathologic evaluation of morcellated uteri is more challenging, and there is a possibility that smaller uterine tumours would be missed. Furthermore, the complexity of this technique may require more advanced training to ensure safety in the hands of novice users [58]. In the review titled \u201cContained Morcellation: Review of Current Methods and Future Directions\u201d, the authors concluded that there is currently no available method for tissue extraction that completely eliminates the risk of cellular dissemination [59]. The FDA discouraged the use of laparoscopic power morcellation to avoid the spread and worsened clinical outcomes of unsuspected uterine malignancy with a first safety communication warning in April 2014 [60,61]. Following this communication regarding power morcellation, utilization of minimally invasive hysterectomy and morcellation decreased [35]. In patients with a history of uncontained uterus or myoma morcellation who report pelvic symptoms, IPM or adenomyoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nRetained uterine or myoma fragments after laparoscopic surgery are able to survive and grow in the peritoneal cavity under hormonal steroid exposure when the uterine blood supply is lost. The lack of systematic follow-up after laparoscopic morcellation could result in an underestimation of the incidence because many cases are asymptomatic. Iatrogenic myoma and adenomyoma have a possible different pathogenetic mechanism, but both pathologies have a common point: theyoriginate after a surgical procedure involving morcellation. In-bag morcellation might decrease the incidence of these iatrogenic conditions and is technical feasible but has some limitations and risks. When a morcellator is used, a thorough inspection of the peritoneal cavity and the observation of no leakage from the bag are required. In addition, the patient should be informed concerning this potential, rare iatrogenic complication and the remaining risk potential of in-bag morcellation as well as provided balanced information on alternative treatment options, particularly when a laparoscopic approach is employed. Although the studies discussed in this review provide a good understanding of the risk factors of IPM and adenomyoma, other prospective data collection is necessary to establish other risk factors in addition to morcellator use to develop an algorithm for patient selection for laparoscopic morcellation of the uterus or myoma, with the aim of improving patient safety.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects\n\n\n","1552":"","1553":"","1554":"","1555":"","1556":"","1557":"","1558":"","1559":"","1560":"","1561":"","1562":"","1563":"","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"","1567":"","1568":"","1569":"","1570":"","1571":"","1572":"","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"","1577":"","1578":"","1579":"","1580":"","1581":"","1582":"","1583":"","1584":"","1585":"","1586":"","1587":"","1588":"","1589":"","1590":"","1591":"","1592":"","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":"","1601":"","1602":"","1603":"","1604":"","1605":"","1606":"","1607":"","1608":"","1609":"","1610":"","1611":"","1612":"","1613":"","1614":"","1615":"","1616":"","1617":"","1618":"","1619":"","1620":"","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"","1631":"","1632":"","1633":"","1634":"","1635":"","1636":"","1637":"","1638":"","1639":"","1640":"","1641":"","1642":"","1643":"","1644":"","1645":"","1646":"","1647":"","1648":"","1649":"","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"","1656":"","1657":"","1658":"","1659":"","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"","1664":"","1665":"","1666":"","1667":"","1668":"","1669":"","1670":"","1671":"","1672":"","1673":"","1674":"","1675":"","1676":"","1677":"","1678":"","1679":"","1680":"","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"","1684":"","1685":"","1686":"","1687":"","1688":"\n\nIntroduction\nSoil salinization is increasing day by day and over 7% of the total world landmass is currently affected by salinity [1]. A significant proportion of this area belongs to agricultural land, resulting in nearly 45 million ha being excluded from cultivation [2]. Salinization can be an effect of natural processes (e.g. geological, hydrological, or weather events) as well as anthropogenic activity (e.g. improper methods of irrigation and fertilization, deforestation, chemical contamination, and poor water management) [3\u20135]. Increased salinity has a negative influence not only on physico-chemical soil parameters (e.g. pH, availability of nutrients) but also on plants (e.g. photosynthesis, water management) and soil microorganisms (e.g. diversity, activity).\nThe plant kingdom contains only a small group of plant species (\u223c1%) belonging to halophytes, which possess highly distinctive capacities for salt tolerance as a result of evolutionary adaptation to their environments. These plants are able to survive and reproduce at concentrations of sodium and chloride ions that would be toxic to most plant species [6]. Halophytes have received particular attention in the last few years not just as model species in salt tolerance research, but also as potential forage, fiber, and biomass crops, as well as platforms for developing crop systems that use saline water and\/or ameliorate salinized soils [7].\nThis study focuses on Salicornia europaea L., a salt marsh halophyte belonging to the Amaranthaceae, which is one of the most salt-tolerant plant species worldwide [8]. Significant advances have been made in understanding how halophytes have adapted to high salinity conditions [6,9]. It is well known that halophytes can cope with high soil salinity due to morphological and biochemical adaptations [1]. However, recently special attention has also been paid to the effect of specific microbial associations, e.g. endophytes, which can increase the tolerance of host-plants to high salinity and other unfavorable environmental conditions [10\u201312]. Salicornia as a wild plant, not modified by plant breeding, has probably retained over millennia the natively established plant-microbiome functional interaction at specific salt-affected areas. Such a naturally developed association between a plant and its microbiota may help the plant to grow and successfully compete with other plants.\nSome plant-associated bacteria can biologically fix atmospheric N2 to plant-available ammonia (NH3). This process is ecologically important as an input of fixed nitrogen (N) into many habitats [13], and represents a promising substitute for chemical N fertilizers. Microorganisms catalyze nitrogen fixation via the enzyme nitrogenase, which has been highly conserved throughout evolution. All N2 fixers carry the nif (nitrogen fixation) genes, which encode the nitrogenase complex [14]. The nif operon includes the nitrogenase structural gene nifH, which has been sequenced to provide a large database from diverse environments [14,15]. One of the best-reported outcomes of this plant-microbe association is the promotion of plant growth by direct and indirect mechanisms. Besides fixing atmospheric N2, these bacteria can also produce plant growth hormones, and some species are reported to improve nutrient uptake and increase plant tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses [16,17].\nSince crop production is highly dependent on chemical nitrogen fertilizers and their extensive use may have negative effects on human and environment health, as well as on generating greenhouse gasses and reducing the ozone layer [18], the existence and application of bacterial diazotrophs adapted to saline conditions in non-host plants could greatly increase the production of glycophytic crops in saline soils.\nThe hypothesis is that associative diazotrophic bacteria, which are known to fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide nitrogen to their host plants, may be established in the microbiota of S. europaea and probably live there endophytically. If diazotrophs exist in the endophyllosphere of S. europaea the questions are: (1) which bacterial species do they belong to; (2) are these species also known to be related to crop plants, and finally (3) how does the level of salinization affect the distribution and community structure of diazotrophic endophytes of S. europaea? More extensive knowledge about diazotrophic endophytes associated with halophytes will facilitate the understanding of possible mechanisms involved in the interaction and possible role of microbiota in adaptation to saline stress conditions.\nIn this study halophyte S. europaea plant samples were collected and analyzed from two sites representing moderate and high soil salinity. The microbiota of S. europaea was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR of both the nifH genes and 16S rDNA. Although the overall abundance of diazotrophs isolated from stems and roots was higher in plants growing at lower salinity, the proportion of potential diazotrophic bacteria in the total bacterial community revealed an enrichment of diazotrophs in the plants grown in highly saline soil. A total of 141 endophytic diazotrophs were cultured and identified based on their phylogenetic affiliations by comparing their 16S rRNA gene sequences.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nSite description and sampling\nPlant samples were collected at two test sites located in central Poland and characterized by extreme anthropogenic (S1) and natural (S2) origin of salinity. Site S1 (N 52\u00b048, E 18\u00b015) comprised meadows near a soda factory (Soda Poland CIECH SA) in Inowroc\u0142aw-M\u0105twy, where a long-term process of inappropriate waste storage from soda production has caused strong alkalization and salinization of soils. The salt meadows are dominated by halophytic species, e.g. Salicornia europaea, Aster tripolium, Spergularia salina, Glaux maritima, Triglochin maritimum, Puccinellia distans and Atriplex prostrata spp. prostrata var. salina. Site S2 (N 52\u00b053, E 18\u00b047) was located in Ciechocinek (close to a brine graduation tower), at the largest lowland health resort in Poland involved in the treatment of respiratory illnesses. In this area a Halophytes Nature Reserve Park and a landscape park \u201cNatura 2000\u201d were established to protect rare plant species [19].\nAt each test site, three sub-plots (2\u202fm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm) were designated at a distance of 10\u202fm from each other. From each sub-plot five plants of S. europaea with adjacent soil (20\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202fcm soil cubes) were collected in autumn 2013 (15 plants per test site and 30 plants in total). Each sample was taken using sterile tools, placed in a separate plastic bag to avoid contamination and immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis.\nSoil samples (three replicates per site) were analyzed according to methods described by van Reeuvijk [20]. The soil at S1 was classified [21] as mineral-organic (organic matter content 10\u201320%) and at S2 as mineral (organic matter content\u202f<\u202f10%). Salinity at both sites was related to the presence of chloride and other anions: Cl\u2212\u202f\u226b\u202fSO4\n2\u2212\u202f>\u202fHCO3\n\u2212. Salinity, measured as the electrical conductivity of a saturated extract, were 55 dS\u2219m\u22121 at S1 and 112 dS\u2219m\u22121 at S2, and resulted from the domination of calcium ions (Ca2+\u202f>\u202fNa+\u202f\u226b\u202fMg2+\u202f>\u202fK+) at S1 and sodium ions (Na+\u202f\u226b\u202fCa2+\u202f>\u202fMg2+\u202f>\u202fK+) at S2 (Table 1\n).\n\n\nPreparation of plant samples for analysis\nEndophytic bacteria were analyzed in two different organs of S. europaea: stems and roots. One averaged sample of analyzed plant organs (stem and root) was prepared (10\u202fg) from five plants sampled at each sub-plot. Finally, from each test site (S1 and S2) three representative samples of stems and roots were analyzed. Plant samples were surface sterilized in 100\u202fml of 15% hydrogen peroxide by shaking (5\u202fmin), then washed three times with 100\u202fmL of sterile 2% NaCl solution. The liquid obtained after third washing was used to assess the sterilization process. Only successfully surface-sterilized plant organs were used for further analysis.\n\n\nAnalysis of nifH gene and 16S rDNA copy numbers in plant organs of S. europaea (real-time PCR assays)\nDNA was extracted from the surface-sterilized and lyophilized plant samples (stems and roots) using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden GmbH, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA concentrations were measured photometrically at \u03bb\u202f=\u202f260\u202fnm (Nano-drop, ThermoFisher). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using a Bio-Rad detection system (Germany). Amplification was performed with primer pairs for: nifH (19F: 5\u2032-GCIWTYTAYGGIAARGGIGG-3\u2032 and 388R: 5\u2032-AAICCRCCRCAIACIACRTC-3\u2032) [22] and 16S rDNA (519f 5\u2032-CAGCMGCCGCGGTAANWC-3\u2032 and 907r 5\u2032-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTT3\u2032) [23]. To ensure appropriate template plant DNA concentrations enabling quantification of the 16S rDNA and the nifH gene, PCR was performed using undiluted, 1:10 diluted, and 1:100 diluted plant DNA. PCR was performed using the program described by Jurayeva et al. [24]. Abundance of nifH (involved in N2\u2013fixation) and 16S rDNA (corresponding to the total number of bacteria) was expressed as copy number of target gene \u03bcg\u22121 of DNA used for amplification. The proportion of nifH-gene copy number per number of 16S rDNA was calculated after both qPCR equilibration curves were equalized in their efficiency.\n\n\nAbundance of endophytic diazotrophs associated with S. europaea\n\nSurface-sterilized plant samples were homogenized in mortars under sterile conditions. The material obtained was used as a starting sample for preparing serial dilutions. Bacterial strains were isolated using medium selective for the growth of diazotrophs [25]. From each variant of isolation (18 in total) three replicates of each dilution (10\u22121\u201310\u22125) were investigated (15 plates per variant, 180 plates in total). Bacteria were grown at 26\u202f\u00b0C for 7 d and counted (one representative dilution with an average number of colonies per plate between 30 and 300; in most cases 10\u22122\u201310\u22124 was chosen for each variant of the experiment). Results are presented as cfu (colony-forming units per gram of fresh plant tissue). From each plant organ (stem and root) and each test site (S1 and S2) 22\u201347 bacterial colonies were chosen based on their different morphological features in order to detect a broader spectrum of bacterial taxa. In total, 141 strains were selected for further investigation (Supplementary materials, Table A). Selected bacterial strains were purified and maintained on agar slants with Rennie medium [25]. All strains were proved for their potential biological nitrogen fixing ability by identifying the presence of the diazotrophic marker gene nifH in the bacterial genomes.\n\n\nMolecular identification of bacterial strains by PCR and sequencing\nSingle colonies cultivated on Rennie medium were suspended in 0.85% NaCl and centrifuged. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 27F (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and 1492R (3\u2032-CTACGG CTACCTTGTTACGA-5\u2032) according to procedure described by Szyma\u0144ska et al. [10] and sequenced using the same primers. Sequencher 5.1 (Gene Codes 20) software was used to assemble the forward and reverse sequences obtained. The sequences acquired were used for identification based on comparing these sequences with reference sequences deposited in the GenBank nucleotide database by BLASTn [26]. A minimum of 99% similarity was required for appropriate identification. All DNA sequences obtained were submitted to GenBank and accession numbers were assigned: MK398004-MK398122 (Supplementary materials, Table A).\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\nThe phylogenetic affiliation of the cultivated strains is based on aligning the sequenced 16S rRNA gene fragments, and their closely related sequences, derived from the GenBank comparison (BLASTn) [26], using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (https:\/\/www.drive5.com\/muscle\/) [27]. The multiple sequence alignment was trimmed with trimAl v1.2 (http:\/\/trimal.cgenomics.org) [28] filtering out positions with 20% or more gaps across the sequences, unless less than 60% of the positions remain as conserved sites. Subsequently, the best-scoring maximum likelihood tree was inferred with RAxML v8.2.12 (https:\/\/github.com\/stamatak\/ standard-RAxML) [29] using the GTRCAT approximation model and rapid bootstrap analysis based on 1000 replicates. Visualization and annotation of the phylogenetic tree was conducted with iTOL v4 (https:\/\/itol.embl.de) [30], taking the binary information of test sites (S1\/S2), plant type (non-\/halophytic) and plant organ (stem\/root) into account.\n\n\nNitrogen (Nt) and carbon (Ct) concentrations in plant tissues\nThe freeze-dried samples of stems and roots sampled from both test sites (S1 and S2) were ground to <0.5\u202fmm by a mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) to determine Nt and Ct concentrations. Analysis was performed using the CHN-O Rapid Elemental Analyser (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Henau, Germany).\n\n\nStatistical analyses\nThe data obtained for nutrient concentration in plant tissues, copy number of nifH and 16S rDNA and total number of cultivable bacterial diazotrophs were analyzed by one- and two-factorial analyses of variance (ANOVA). The statistics were computed using STATISTICA (StatSoft, 2010).\n\n\n\nResults\n\nNutrient concentrations in the plant organs of S. europaea\n\nThe halophyte Salicornia europaea L was sampled from two saline environments with contrasting salinity (ECe 55 dS m\u22121 at test site S1, and 112 dS m\u22121 at test site S2). Although the soil total nitrogen content was higher in the lower saline soil S1, the nitrogen concentration in stems and roots of S. europaea L. was not significantly different between plants grown on S1 and S2. Generally the N concentration in stems was higher than in roots (Fig. 1\n; Supplementary materials: Table A). In contrast to N, significantly higher levels of carbon were found in the roots, and at the test site S1 (lower soil salinity) the concentration of this element in plant tissues was generally higher than at S2 (higher salinity). Analysis of the carbon-nitrogen ratio was correlated with the results obtained for carbon.\n\n\nProportion of nifH gene at 16S rDNA copy numbers in stems and roots of S. europaea depend on the soil salinity level\nTo assess the number of potential diazotrophic organisms in the population, the nifH genes (encoding potential diazotrophic bacteria) and the total bacterial community was determined in plant tissues of S. europaea by analyzing both nifH gene and 16S rDNA copy numbers in the same DNA sample using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Knowing, that both, the 16S rDNA and the nifH gene copy numbers are variable between various bacterial species and the absolute numbers can be affected by this variation, the present calculation was conducted to proximately estimate a proportional shift within the endophytic bacterial community. The highest abundance of 16S rDNA and nifH genes (1.04\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 and 2.85\u202f\u00d7\u202f105, respectively) was observed in the stems of S. europaea growing at S1, characterized by lower salinity levels in the soil. In the other variants of the experiment, the copy number of the genes did not differ significantly from each other, and ranged between 2.01 and 2.69\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 for 16S rDNA copy number, and 1.08\u20131.84\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 for nifH copy number (Fig. 2\nA). The proportion of potential diazotrophic bacterial numbers at total bacterial counts was calculated using the molecular information obtained from DNA samples extracted from roots and stems. After both qPCR equilibration curves were equalized in their efficiency, the data revealed an enrichment of potential diazotrophic bacteria within the total bacterial community in the halophyte S. europaea grown in highly saline conditions (S2) (Fig. 2B).\n\n\nAbundance and taxonomic structure of cultivable endophytic diazotrophs\nAnalysis of bacterial diazotrophs which were isolated and cultivable from stems and roots of S. europaea L. growing at both test sites S1 and S2 showed a significantly higher abundance of this group of microorganisms in roots that had direct contact with highly diverse microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil (Fig. 3\n). The abundance of diazotrophs isolated from stems and roots at S1 was 1.5- and 1.3-fold higher (respectively) than in plants growing at higher salinity (S2), ranging from 5.7 to 6.3 log10 cfu g\u22121 fresh plant tissue at S1 and from 3.6 to 4.8 log10 cfu g\u22121 fresh plant tissue at S2.\nIn total, 141 endophytic diazotrophs were isolated from stems and roots of S. europaea L. sampled at the two test sites: 70\/71 strains from plants growing at test site S1\/S2 (47 isolates\/site from stems and 23\u201324 from roots) (Fig. 4\n). Fig. 4 shows the phylogenetic affiliations (based on 16S rRNA genes) of diazotrophic strains isolated from the endophyllosphere (stems, roots) of the halophyte S. europaea L. compared to endospheric diazotrophs originating from non-halophytic crop plants. Most of the endophytic diazotrophs from S. europaea L belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria (50%) and Proteobacteria (47%), and only a few to Firmicutes (3%). At S2 (higher salinity, marked with a red filled point) diazotrophs were strongly dominated by Actinobacteria and at S1 (lower salinity, marked by red empty point) by Proteobacteria. The genus Curtobacterium and Microbacterium (phylum Actinobacteria) were isolated from both test sites, but were more abundant at S2, and the genus Rhodococcus, Cellulomonas, Sanguibacter, Clavibacter, Frigoribacterium, Agreia and Herbiconiux were found exclusively at S2. The genus Pseudomonas (phylum Proteobacteria) was isolated from both test sites, but dominated at S1, and Pantoea was characteristic only for S1, with higher abundance in stems. In general, diazotrophs isolated from plant organs of S. europaea growing at S2 were affiliated to 13 different genera that were not observed at all at S1, while at S1 strains from only two genera were isolated which were not detected at S2. These observations confirm a higher diversity within the diazotrophic endophytic microbiota of the halophytic plant S. europaea when growing in higher saline soils (S2). Surprisingly, for the first time, from the endophyllosphere and endorhizosphere of the halophytic plant S. europaea a wide range of genera from Actinobacteria phylum were isolated, while these diazotrophs were not yet detected in the plant endorhizosphere or endophyllosphere of glyophytes (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nCrop production in saline areas is a huge challenge since all plant species currently used in agriculture belong to glycophytes, and these are relatively sensitive to medium and high salt concentrations in soils. S. europaea belongs to a family of underutilized plants with naturally developed tolerance to unfavorable environmental conditions. In previous studies with the use of two endophytic bacterial strains isolated from S. europaea (Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 [12] we have revealed more evident effect of strain containing nifH gene on the growth of Beta vulgaris under different concentrations of salinity. This is why the presented work, for the first time, focused on diazotrophic endophytes of this halophyte and characterized this important group of bacteria. Diazotrophic endophytes are known to protect the host-plant against harsh environmental conditions by increasing nutrient availability or producing phytohormones [17].\n\nBacterial endophytes of S. europaea: The total bacterial community vs. diazotrophs\nSince the abundance of total bacterial counts from S. europaea growing at the test site characterized by higher salinity (S2: 112 dS\/m) was significantly lower than in moderate saline soil (S1), we suggest that bacteria are relatively sensitive to extreme concentrations of salt, but tolerate medium soil salinity (S1: 55 dS\/m). Similarly, an overall lower number of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in root and rhizosphere samples of S. europaea from the same S2 test site were identified earlier by Szyma\u0144ska et al. [10]. Therefore it seems correct to conclude that extreme salinity generally inhibits microbial abundance. However, proportionally the number of potential diazotrophic bacteria was enriched in both stem and root samples of S. europaea when grown in extremely salty conditions. Moreover, observed at both S1 and S2 sites, the significantly higher number of diazotrophs isolated from roots than stems confirms that the main source of diazotrophs of S. europaea is rhizosphere soil, an environment with the highest microbial diversity and activity.\nA culture-independent approach achieved by analyzing nifH transcripts provided results on active diazotrophs in the rhizosphere, and nif gene amplification and sequencing has been used to identify nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with rice, sorghum, wheat and maize [18]. Present results using real-time qPCR show significantly higher nifH and 16S rDNA copy numbers in the stems than in the roots of S. europaea from S1 (lower salinity), which is not consistent with the results obtained for cultivable diazotrophs. This contradiction could originate from the lack of suitable media to cultivate as yet non-cultured diazotrophic organisms, especially when they grow within the stem endophyllosphere, where specific nutritional and environmental niches exist that have only recently started to discover [31].\nNitrogen is one of the most abundant elements in plants (after carbon: about 40% of plant dry matter and oxygen: about 45%); however N concentrations in plant tissues is plant species specific and changes during developmental stages (higher in young tissues and lower in mature or senesced parts) [32,33]. In the present experiments at both analyzed test sites, nitrogen concentrations in plant tissues of S. europaea were in the range of 0.68\u20131.34% of dry plant weight, with significantly higher N values observed for shoots than roots. However this is a relatively low level of N compared to other crops, e.g. wheat (Triticum aestivum) with N contents in shoots between 1.5 and 3% of plant dry weight [32]. There are three possible reasons for such low nitrogen concentrations in S. europaea tissues: (i) the generally low nitrogen demand of this crop; (ii) the late growing season when samples were collected for testing (autumn), or (iii) the extremely low N content in the soil at both analyzed test sites (0.2\u20130.5 Nt). Since plant-associated microorganisms (rhizosphere, symbiotic or endophytic) are key factors in increasing plant nutrient efficiency [e.g. [34,35]], it is assumed that S. europaea plants growing in poor soils are stimulated by unique microorganisms that allow them to overcome deficiencies in the environment.\n\n\nEndophytic diazotrophs of S. europaea\n\nPrevious studies revealed that the microbiome of S. europaea is dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [11,36,37], and many of their representatives belong to typical halotolerant bacteria with a potential role in mitigating salt stress, e.g. Salinicola sp., Kushneria sp. [10]. In general, diazotrophs can be found among alphaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, betaproteobacteria and cyanobacteria; however they generally correspond to minor components of the ecosystem since nitrogen fixation is an energetically expensive process for bacteria [18]. Endophytic diazotrophs isolated from S. europaea represent a broad range of N2-fixing bacteria with Actinobacteria dominating at the test site characterized by higher salinity (S2), and Proteobacteria at lower salinity (S1). Most of the isolates from Actinobacteria (70 isolates, in total) belonged to the genus Curtobacterium (30 isolates) (Curtobacterium sp., C. flaccumfaciens, C. herbarum) and Microbacterium (17 isolates) (Microbacterium sp., M. kitamiense, M. oxydans), and some of them to Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Cellulomonas, Sanguibacter, Clavibacter, Cryocola\/Labedella, Frigoribacterium, Agreia, Herbiconiux, and Plantibacter. But all of them have been identified as endophytic diazotrophs for the first time. These organisms mostly originated from the endophyllosphere of the halophyte S. europaea grown on the high saline test site S2. It is worth to mention that salt-tolerant diazotrophic Actinobacteria: Brachybacterium saurashtrense sp. nov. [38] and Zhihengliuella somnathii sp. nov. [39] were isolated earlier from other Salicornia spp. (e.g. S. brachiata). Further diazotrophic endophytes in the present study belong to Proteobacteria (66 isolates in total), dominated by two genera: Pseudomonas (29 isolates) (Pseudomonas sp., P. marincola, P. fluorescens, P. koreensis) and Pantoea (17 isolates) (Pantoea sp., P. vagans, P. ananatis). Other examples of diazotrophic bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas and are also associated with crops are: P. aeruginosa [JF899310] isolated from Pennisetum glaucum (L.) [40], and Pseudomonas sp. SB2 [HF566309] isolated from a grape variety [41].\nDiazotrophs from the genera Glucanacetobacter, Azospirillum, Kosakonia and Enterobacter, which are often detected and described as endophytes in glyophytic crops [e.g. [42] were not isolated from the halophyte S. europaea. The phylum Firmicutes was represented by only 4 strains isolated from S2 (higher salinity) (belonging to Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., B. pumilus). This phylum in general is known as a source of diazotrophs; however only one example of a crop endophyte was noted so far (Paenibacillus polymyxa [KU306835]) (Fig. 4).\nHalotolerant diazotrophic bacteria can positively promote growth of many crops under salt stress conditions, e.g. Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus E19T isolated from the rhizosphere of Plantago winteri stimulated growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by reducing ethylene emission [43,44], five diazotrophic bacteria (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, and Ochrobactrum) isolated from the roots of a halophyte Arthrocnemum indicum successfully colonized the peanut roots and were capable of promoting the plant growth by maintaining ion homeostasis and ROS levels under salt stress condition [45], Pseudomonas stutzeri ISE12 isolated from S. europaea alleviated the salt stress of rape (Brassica napus L.) by activating their antioxidant defence system and triggering the rearrangement of cell walls [46].\nIn summary, the present results reveal enrichment of diazotrophic endophytes in S. europaea represented by a highly diverse community, and many isolates were identified for the first time. Such isolates have not yet been detected within the endorhizo- or endophyllosphere of other crop plants, which confirms the high specificity of this group of microorganisms to the saline environment. Notably, N2-fixing bacteria represented by Actinobacteria seem to have higher tolerance to salinity than Proteobacteria, which were more often observed at lower salinity. Whether and which of these organisms alleviate salt stress conditions or help the plant by supplying nitrogen or specific hormones to adapt to such harsh conditions remains to be confirmed in future studies with the use of microscopic methods, e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Interestingly, the number of cultivable diazotrophic strains was higher in roots of S. europaea suggesting that this plant organ possess unique properties for selecting N2-fixing bacteria.\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nS. europaea represents a convenient host-plant system for analyzing a range of diazotrophs. Although extreme soil salinity slightly decreases their abundance it profoundly affects their taxonomic structure. Selection of diazotrophic endophytes compatible with specific plant genotypes could become a common practice for improving plant tolerance to unfavorable saline soils to complement advanced technologies applied in green plant biotechnology. The herewith established collection of halotolerant diazotrophic bacteria could provide an excellent source of such biostimulants to be tested in agriculture.\n\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1689":"\n\nIntroduction and historical aspects of the discovery of endophytes with focus on Azospirillum and related diazotrophs\nMore than one decade ago, the hologenome theory was introduced to express the tight interaction of microbes with animals and plants as basis for a better adaptation to changing environmental conditions with implications for co-evolution and speciation [1]. Holobionts are multicellular eukaryotic organisms living together in a symbiont-like manner with different types of external and internal microorganism (e.g. endophytes), which contribute essential life traits [2,3]. A more recent study concludes, that in order to understand speciation in the frame of the hologenome concept holobionts do not necessarily need to be viewed as units of selection, but it is sufficient to consider them as units of tight co-operation of eu- and prokaryotic organisms [4]. Looking back, it took a long time until this detailed view of omnipresent organismic interactions was established by firm evidence, because the appropriate methodological approaches had not been available. First evidences for bacterial endophytes, i.e. bacteria colonizing the interior of plants, were already published in the late 19th century. In 1887, M. L. V. Galippe reported the isolation of bacteria from the interior of different plants and postulated soil as origin of these bacteria [5]. Since he could not further prove their location and identity, these findings were heavily criticized. However, Hellriegel and Wilfarth demonstrated in 1888 the presence of endophytic bacteria within root nodules of legumes and their contribution of nitrogen for plant growth (reviewed by R.H. Burris) [6]. The general concept of the \u201crhizosphere\u201d as the habitat where plant roots attract beneficial and pathogenic soil microbes by their exudates was finally coined by L. Hiltner in 1904 [7]. He found that microbes were enriched around the roots, but also recognized bacteria-like bodies within roots, which he called \u201cbacteriorhiza\u201d [8]. This term was coined in analogy to the term \u201cmycorrhiza\u201d, which had been defined in 1885 for filamentous organisms within roots by Albert Bernhard Frank, a German botanist and biologist. In 1893, Hiltner and Nobbe developed the first efficient Rhizobium-based inoculants, which they called \u201cNitragin\u201d, based on their discovery of host specificities in Rhizobium-legume symbioses [9]. However, Hiltner was not successful to establish plant growth promotion by bacterial inoculation of non-leguminous plants. His quite early death in 1923 and the difficult post-world war situation in Germany contributed to slow down scientific progress in this field. For many decades no further major breakthrough on plant growth promoting bacteria was reported. Only in the 1970s new interest arose on plant beneficial bacteria after the isolation and introduction of Azospirillum spp. by D\u00f6bereiner and Day [10]. In the 1980s for example Baldani and coworkers [11,12], and Cavalcante and D\u00f6bereiner [13] from EMBRAPA-Agrobiologia, Serop\u00e9dica, RJ, Brazil, isolated and characterized new diazotrophic bacteria from roots of different important crop plants. The high engagement and dedication for their science in combination with establishing a worldwide cooperation including sharing newest results as well as newly isolated strains by Johanna D\u00f6bereiner helped enormously in developing this field of research. Most recently, a book describes Johanna D\u00f6bereine\u0155s life as highly engaged scientist [14]. In 1981, Walter Klingm\u00fcller, head of genetic department at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, initiated a series of six biannual workshops entitled \u201cAzospirillum: Genetics, Physiology and Ecology\u201d bringing together the international research community on Azospirillum and related microorganisms \u2013 the last two workshops were organized by Istvan Fendrik, Maddalena del Gallo and Jos Vanderleyden [15\u201320]. While the first four workshops were focused on research about Azospirillum spp., increasing interest and research activities also on other plant-growth promoting bacteria led to a broadening of the subject in the workshops V and VI. The articles in the corresponding proceeding books not only document the groundbreaking establishment of molecular genetic tools for Azospirillum by several research groups and discoveries of new endophytic diazotrophic bacteria, but also most interesting work by different groups on outstanding physiological properties, like e.g. the cyst-formation of Azospirillum spp., and early field application trials [15\u201320]. In parallel, an international symposium series \u201cBiological Nitrogen Fixation with Non-Legumes\u201d started in 1979; the XVIth symposium of this series was held in August 2018 in Foz de Iguacu, Brazil, attracting more than 300 participants (www.mpcp2018.com.br). Quite recently, the current status of research on endophytic diazotrophic rhizobacteria was also summarized by Reinhold et al. [21] and Kandel et al. [22].\nThe challenge for pioneering research on endophytic diazotrophs and other plant growth promoting bacteria was not only to understand the biochemical and genetic processes characterizing the basis for plant growth promotion, but also the ecology of the interaction with their host plants as fundament of the beneficial action. The ultimate applied goal was to use these bacteria as so-called \u201cbiofertilizer\u201d or \u201cbiostimulants\u201d towards the establishment of sustainable agricultural management. In the 1980s, substantial agronomic applications were still far away on the horizon, while within the last ten years several Azospirillum brasilense strains [23] and other PGPRs including biocontrol-active Gram-positive bacteria [e.g. [24]] have been applied successfully in agro-biotechnology worldwide. However, in this mini-review, the vast development of Gram-positive inoculants has not been covered. It is still a key issue to provide unequivocal evidences for the colonization and localization of the bacteria as well as their in situ activities in the rhizosphere and within the plant. Serological and molecular genetic techniques suitable for these in situ analyses have been developed over the years, but always have to be adapted for successful identification, localization and quantification of bacteria in their specific association with plants. In addition, key functions in the beneficial interaction of rhizobacteria with plants needed to be identified. Moreover, the development of culture independent approaches was necessary to overcome the bias of studying only culturable members of the plant microbiome. In this review, a number of techniques and approaches are presented from a historical to current development perspective, which allows the detailed analysis of the composition of beneficial plant microbiota \u2013 even down to the level of monitoring specific inoculant strains - and their functions leading to plant growth promotion. Furthermore, a scientific based distinction of plant beneficial from opportunistic human pathogenic bacteria is addressed.\n\n\nTechniques for resolving the diversity and function of the plant microbiome at highest resolution\n\nSerological techniques coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as identification and quantification tools\nThe prerequisite of creating antibodies is the availability of bacteria in pure culture, which certainly is a limitation for the application of this approach, since many plant-associated bacteria are difficult to cultivate. After developing fluorescent-labeled monoclonal antibodies against A. brasilense Sp7 which are directed against EPS-cell surface compounds [25,26], confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was successfully used by Schloter et al. in 1993 for the first time to produce clear images of these bacteria being embedded in the rhizoplane matrix [27]. Using the confocal technique as well as silver enhancement of the antibody detection, the root colonization pattern of the plant growth promoting Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii R39 was characterized in different gramineaeous plants in 1997 by Schloter et al. [28]. In the same year, Yanni et al. [29] could also demonstrate the endophytic colonization of rice by the N2-fixing symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain C6 in Egyptian berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) applying immunofluorescence techniques. This demonstrated for the first time an intimate colonization also of rice by Rhizobium. In the case of A. brasilense, monoclonal antibodies against the putative endophytic strain Sp245, isolated from surface disinfected wheat roots [30,31], demonstrated a different colonization pattern of roots by the strains Sp7 and Sp245: strain Sp7 colonized wheat roots mostly at the root-surface, while strain Sp245 was able to enter the root, colonizing the apoplast tissue in wheat roots [32]. In addition, also quantitative colonization data of Sp7 and Sp245 in wheat plants could be obtained by the ELISA-technique, confirming the microscopic evidences of different colonization patterns [32]. Furthermore, in situ expression of specific enzymes (e. g. nitrogenase) in different rhizobacteria colonizing their host plant could be achieved using this technique [33].\nMonoclonal or mono-specific polyclonal antibodies are also unique tools to easily enrich and cultivate a high diversity of root-associated bacteria of the same or closely related species from the root and the rhizosphere using the antibody based immuno-trapping technique [34]. For example, antibodies against whole cells of a rhizosphere isolate of Ochrobactrum anthropi were coated on microtiter plates, followed by adsorption of soil extracts. After proper washing steps, the bound bacteria were desorbed with 0.1\u202fM KCl-solution. This resulted in a more than 100-times enrichment of this specific group of bacteria and isolates of this particular species could be easily obtained. Thus, the influence of the crop plant, management practices, and ecotoxicological effects of applied agrochemicals on the micro-diversity spectra of Ochrobactrum anthropi communities in soils and the rhizosphere could be isolated and studied [35]. Even isolates of closely related new species could be retrieved using the immuno-trapping approach [36]. The application of this immuno-enrichment technique turned out to enable access to a hidden bacterial micro-diversity and should be applied more generally. In this straightforward approach, a greater diversity of saprophytic and beneficial rhizobacteria of specific species may be achieved.\n\n\nRibosomal RNA as identification marker with limitations to separate closely related strains\nThe establishment of a phylogenetically based natural system of organisms for the domains Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya by Carl R. Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark L. Wheelis in 1990 [37] was the landmark for a molecular approach to the phylogeny of Bacteria and Archaea. The 16S rRNA genes of Bacteria rapidly became the gold standard of molecular phylogenetic analysis, because the ribosomal RNA is present in all organisms and its sequence has highly conserved and variable regions. This facilitates the design of primers or oligonucleotide probes, usually 16\u201320 nucleotides long, with specificities to different taxonomic levels: probes complementary to conserved regions of the 16S or 23S rRNA will identify all bacteria of a high taxonomical rank, e.g. family or domain level, while for targeting bacteria on genus or in some cases - if a differentiation is possible - even species level, probes need to target highly variable regions of the rRNA specific to the taxonomic group of interest. In addition, the rRNA genes are expressed at very high levels in physiologically active cells (with copy numbers up and over 10.000), are more stable compared to mRNA due to their secondary structure and are therefore good targets for labelling the bacteria with fluorescent probes. Consequently, cells with low activity have usually low rRNA contents, resulting in low fluorescence labeling due to an insufficient number of target sites for the probes. This means on the one hand that positively labeled cells are very likely also functionally relevant for the analyzed habitat, but on the other hand also implies that this method is of limited use for targeting bacteria with low physiological activity. In addition, the cell wall penetration of applied probes has to be optimized, i.e. due to their differences in cell wall structure, Gram-negative and Gram-positive cells need to be treated with different fixation protocols to enable the phylogenetic probes to get into the cells [38]. Despite some obvious limitations of this approach, so-called \u201cphylogenetic stains\u201d became rather quickly a widely employed tool to identify single cells using the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique [39]. In combination with flow cytometry, FISH was successfully applied to quantify single cells [40] or to identify and localize bacterial consortia in complex natural habitats with the help of highly resolving confocal laser scanning microscopy and differentially labeled sets of oligonucleotide probes [41].\nThe first application of the FISH-technique coupled with CLSM-application to characterize plant microbiota was to identify and localize A. brasilense strains in the rhizosphere of wheat [42]. The inoculated A. brasilense bacteria colonizing the root surface and intercellular spaces in the epidermis had swollen cyst-like morphology harboring high ribosome content, which verified earlier evidences from light and electron-microscopic scanning [42]. The productive cooperation with the institute of Prof. Karl-Heinz Schleifer (TU M\u00fcnchen), coming from the \u201cphylogenetic school\u201d of Prof. Otto Kandler (LMU M\u00fcnchen), was very helpful to establish the FISH-technique for rhizosphere research. It could further be demonstrated that A. brasilense strain Sp245 could colonize wheat roots also endophytically. Some root hairs or intercellular spaces in the root cortex and even cortical cells were heavily colonized by the strain Sp245 showing high staining intensity with the rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes reflecting high physiological activity of the bacteria [42]. A combination of a differentially fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibody against A. brasilense Wa3, and a species-specific oligonucleotide for A. brasilense revealed a different colonization profile of the strains Wa3 and Sp245 [43]. In the 1990s, when six Azospirillum species were known, all Azospirillum spp. could be clearly distinguished using a set of differentiating oligonucleotide probes [44]. At present, 19 different Azospirillum species are known and validly published, which makes it difficult to clearly allocate new isolates to one of these very closely related species by 16S rRNA sequences and 16S rRNA directed probes. Although the larger 23S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic regions provide higher separating power, these different species are impossible to separate with individual species-specific probes. The present solution of differentiation and even strain-specific identification is provided by the increasingly available whole genome sequences. Based on the comparison of the different available whole genome sequences within one species, strain-specific sequences could be found for e.g. A. brasilense strain FP2. Primers derived from these unique regions led to a specific and quantitative amplification of the target strain even from natural habitats like soil-grown wheat plants [45]. Thus, whole genome sequencing is becoming an ever more popular approach and currently only suffers from a lack of genome information for type and reference strains in the database.\nThere are also severe limitations for the application of the FISH-technique to identify and localize endophytic bacteria. In many environmental samples and also in adult field grown plants, like sugarcane, multiple auto-fluorescent objects in the sizes of bacteria are present in the tissue or within cells [46] (Fig. 1\n). Therefore, an alternative labelling method replacing fluorescence was necessary. Schmidt et al. [47] developed a modification of the CARD-FISH-protocol using gold-particles resulting in a specific bacterial identification using scanning electron microscopy as detection method for the deposited gold-particles. Nevertheless, this technique is limited to surface scans and therefore thin sections are required for the analysis of endophytic communities.\n\n\nFluorescent protein-tagging for in situ analysis of structural and functional aspects\nA very powerful cell labelling method is the tagging with a constitutively expressed gene coding for a fluorescing protein, like the green-fluorescent protein (GFP). The basics and variations of this approach were reviewed by Crivat and Caraska [48]. Several applications for studying rhizosphere bacteria were reviewed by Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek [49]. Fig. 2\n shows fluorescence-tagged Herbaspirillum frisingense cells located within root tissue. Alternatively the tagging gene can be inserted under the control of a promotor from a gene of interest to study its expression in situ\n[50]. Furthermore, a GusA-kanamycin reporter gene was inserted into the nifH-genes of an A. brasilense wild type and ammonium-excreting strains to facilitate an expression analysis in barley roots [51]. Quantitative data can be retrieved even from field samples, as was demonstrated by You et al. [52]. In a GFP-tagged Herbaspirillum the expression of nifH was quantified by RT-qPCR and related to the amount of the tagged bacteria colonizing rice endophytically.\nConcluding this phylogenetic and identification part, it can be stated that 16S rRNA-based phylogeny is still the prerequisite for powerful approaches of bacterial identification, including in situ localization by FISH as well as high-throughput amplicon sequencing based community analysis (discussed in the next section), but the applications are limited. Detailed resolution of diversity and functional aspects in a strain-specific resolution may also need molecular tagging approaches or advanced bioinformatic analyses based on whole genome sequence information.\n\n\nCommunity metagenomics and functional transcriptomics of bacteria and plants\nUndoubtedly, the culture-independent analysis of complex bacterial communities associated with plants would not be possible without using PCR-based amplification of different regions of the 16S rRNA gene. As prerequisite, DNA or RNA needs to be isolated from plant material and purified to remove plant substances inhibiting the PCR enzymatic reactions. While a proper quality of DNA\/RNA is quite easily achievable from plant seedlings, especially, from soil free model experiments, it can be very challenging to obtain sufficiently pure DNA\/RNA in enough quantity from field grown, adult plants. However, after optimization, this important initial step of microbial community analysis was achieved in several cases. For example, Fischer et al. [53] retrieved many bacterial 16S rRNA sequences from field grown sugarcane plants, which were not known from cultivation-based approaches. From their data it became obvious that a high diversity of diazotrophic bacteria colonized roots and stems and also a high diversity of nifH-genes was expressed. However, from the five inoculated strains of the EMBRAPA-inoculum (Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5T-BR11281, Nitrospirillum amazonense Cbamc-BR11145, Herbaspirillum seropedicae HRC54-BR11335, Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans HCC103-BR11504, and Paraburkholderia tropica PPe8T-BR11366), only Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5 was found to be able to colonize sugarcane roots and stems for several months [53]. A high diversity of different active Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species was also found in these adult, field grown sugarcane plants, based on retrieved 16S rRNA. This clear demonstration of hitherto only rarely observed diversity of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains colonizing sugarcane and other non-legume plants triggered the attempt to isolate these bacteria in scavenging experiments with broad host range legumes [54], which resulted in the successful isolation of a diversity of Bradyrhizobia. The knowledge about the high diversity of uncultured bacteria within the plant microbiota also led to isolation approaches not aiming for single bacteria through specific enrichment procedures but for whole communities in non-selective complex media. Indeed, this yielded the growth of bacterial consortia, including species which could not be isolated from the plant microbial community before. This has been exemplified for the sugarcane community yielding complex plant growth promoting consortia [55]. However, as this approach is difficult and lacks reproducibility, it seems more straightforward to isolate members of the plant microbiota using plant derived cultivation media and subsequently combining these individual pure isolates based on functional criteria (so-called \u201csyncoms\u201d).\nThe crosstalk of beneficial endophytic bacteria and their plant hosts during the interactions is of key importance to understand holobiontic interactions and to optimize the efficiency of inoculation trials. Several highlights of important ecophysiological and interactive traits for plant microbiota and their hosts in a holobiontic context could be already identified by metagenomic and especially transcriptomic studies at both the bacterial and plant side [56\u201359]. Metagenome and transcriptome analyses on both bacterial and plant side during the interaction contribute very important functional information. However, to guarantee the reliability and reproducibility of these types of results principles for standardization have to be followed, as was learned from human microbiome research [60,61]. Based on frequently expressed genes during the interaction of plant endophytic bacterial communities in the holobiont context, functions like e.g. osmoadaptation, phytohormone production, oxygen tolerance and quorum sensing are of particular relevance.\n\n\n\nDiscrimination of plant beneficial bacteria from closely related human pathogenic bacteria exemplified by A. brasilense and Roseomonas fauriae\n\nThe rhizosphere is a habitat, which is colonized by a phenotypically wide spectrum of bacteria: from symbionts to pathogens. This has been pointed out by Berg et al. [62] and more recently by Mendes et al. [63], who highlighted the presence of plant beneficial, plant pathogenic and human pathogenic microorganisms in the rhizosphere. Already Lorenz Hiltner had proposed that many \u201cwanted or unwanted guests\u201d are attracted by root derived nutrients [7]. Even within a particular rhizobacterial genus, species with plant beneficial and pathogenic phenotypes are known [64].\nIn recent years, isolates with almost identical 16S rRNA to A. brasilense type strain Sp7, which also have high root colonization potential [65], were retrieved from wounds and other human sources. These isolates had been originally classified as Roseomonas fauriae or R. genomospecies 6, but lately they were reallocated to the A. brasilense species [66], based on wet DNA-DNA-hybridization analysis using the re-association method according to Brenner et al. [67]. Also, the ITS region of 16S-23S rRNA genes and many household genes are almost identical (Fig. 3\n).\nHowever, recent whole genome DNA-DNA hybridization analyses using a spectrophotometric determination of re-association kinetics [69] revealed only 61.2% and 54.4% DNA-DNA sequence identity between A. brasilense Sp7T and Roseomonas fauriae and R. genomospecies 6 (measurements of DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany, unpublished) (Table 1\n). This definitely argues for a phylogenetic separation of A. brasilense from these opportunistic pathogenic Roseomonas bacteria. These results were corroborated by in silico determinations of ANI-values (Average Nucleotide Identity) based on whole genome sequences [70]. Based on a concatenated phylogenetic analysis of rpoD- and 16S rRNA gene sequences [70], it was further proposed to separate the A. brasilense strains into three closely related species: A. brasilense sensu stricto, A. formosense\n[71] and A. himalayense\n[72]. Thus, it became apparent, that there is an unresolved micro-diversity within the species of A. brasilense. In addition, the plant endophytic A. brasilense strains Sp245, Az39, and strain NH, isolated from salt-affected wheat rhizosphere from Northern Algeria [73], were all shown to have DNA-DNA-hybridization values around 50% compared to the A. brasilense Sp7T (Table 1). Therefore, further DNA-DNA hybridization studies and whole genome sequence analyses are necessary to clarify the relationship within A. brasilense and closely related species and their phylogenetic relationship to R. fauriae and R. genomospecies 6.\nThe application of whole genome-based comparative software tools together with the assessment of the pathogenic potential of each species [74], finally helped to clarify the difficult case of distinction between saprophytic or beneficial and pathogenic strains within the genus Burkholderia. This genus harbored a large number of species with human pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic phenotypes as well as environmental and plant growth beneficial and symbiotic species. For a long time, there was a situation, when regulatory authorities banned every environmental release of a Burkholderia strain, including the beneficial and even symbiotic ones. Now, based on the available complete genome sequence data, conserved sequence indels (CSI) were successfully used as molecular marker for the demarcation of the Burkholderia groups [75]. Finally, there are at present three different genera within the Burkholderia cluster: (i) Burkholderia, containing the pathogens and opportunistic pathogens, (ii) Paraburkholderia, comprising the plant-associated and -beneficial species, and (iii) the Caballeronia cluster, a group of environmental species [76]. An even more complex situation is present within the species Serratia marcescens. Strains of environmental and nosocomial origins were intermixed without any handle to separate them based on a strict and efficient scientific approach. Whole genome multilocus sequence types (wgMLSTs) and core genome multilocus sequence types (cgMLSTs) were created with the PHYLIP program UPGMA algorithm creating two sectors representing strains with environmental or nosocomial origins [64]. Since there were even genomes identified, which reflected intermediary genomic situations, there is the chance to have even closer insights into steps of micro-evolution to optimize the fitness in an apparently altered habitat.\n\n\nMajor traits of rhizosphere bacteria for efficient root colonization\n\nOsmoadaptation\nLack of available water is causing stress to each living organism, because all life processes and essential proteins and cellular structures are dependent in their native conformation on available water molecules. Due to their molecular structure, several small molecules, so-called osmolytes, like proline, glycine betaine, ectoin, and trehalose are able to replace water molecules to some degree [77]. During osmoadaptation, organisms activate the synthesis or uptake of these and similar substances within their cells. Since these osmolytes are functional across different organisms, microbes and higher organisms can help each other out under water stress [78]. They also enable to protect salt-sensitive enzymes and stabilize cellular structures and functions by balancing the osmotic pressure in plant cells against the outside osmotic pressure caused by salt or water deficiency. In saline soils, osmotolerance mechanisms are omnipresent. For rhizosphere bacteria, osmoadaptation has selective power also in non-saline soils, because salt is being concentrated around the roots during the continuous uptake of water by the plant, resulting in an accumulation of ions in the rhizosphere. In addition, during daytime, the transpiration stream causes water deficiency in the rhizoplane, which may only be replenished during night time by slow diffusion of water from root-distant soil habitats. This water dynamics and the increasing salt-pollution of soils made osmo-adaptation and osmo-tolerance important traits in rhizosphere bacteria [79]. Moreover, the salt-tolerant IAA-producing rhizobacterium A. brasilense NH isolated from salt-affect rhizosphere soil of wheat in northern Algeria, can replenish specific phytohormones, like indole acetic acid (IAA, i.e. auxin), which are not sufficiently produced by salt-stressed root tissues [80]. In salt-affected soils, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase activity of rhizobacteria is of particular relevance, because due to this enzymatic activity, elevated levels of ethylene are reduced in roots, which would inhibit plant activities drastically [81,82]. It is remarkable that the occurrence of the ACC-deaminase gene is rather frequent in plant-associated bacteria from saline habitats and there are indications of horizontal gene transfer of this beneficial trait [83].\nAmong Azospirillum spp. different levels of osmotolerance can be found [84]. A. halopraeferens has the highest salt-tolerance and it could be shown that it is able to synthesize glycine betaine or take up and transform choline into betaine [85], while A. brasilense is only able to take up betaine glycine [86]. Trehalose is not significantly used as osmolyte by A. brasilense. However, when transformed with a plasmid harboring a trehalose biosynthesis gene-fusion from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, A. brasilense Cd accumulates trehalose under water stress and is able to grow up to 0.5\u202fM NaCl. Furthermore, maize plants inoculated with this engineered bacterium were able to withstand drought stress and increase its biomass and grain yield [87]. The ability of salt-tolerant A. brasilense and A. halopraeferens strains to utilize proline and other amino acids as C-source for growth was only rather limited [88]. A. brasilense strains with increased NaCl-tolerance could be isolated which proved to be spontaneously resistant to the toxic proline antimetabolite dehydroproline under mild salt stress conditions [89]. Another relevant stress adaptation in Azospirillum is the cyst formation, which occurs when cells are challenged with nutrient deprivation or desiccation. In Azospirillum this regularly occurs, when cells are inoculated to roots as was shown in several independent techniques [42]. The induction of cyst formation can also be triggered by the application of fructose and nitrate as C- and N-sources in laboratory media. Malinich and Bauer [90] recently compared the metabolic and replicative gene expression by transcriptome analysis in vegetative and cyst states of A. brasilense.\n\n\nPhytohormones and other growth enhancers\nBesides IAA and derived substances with auxin activity, also nitrogen oxide (NO) is often found as plant growth regulating compound in rhizosphere bacteria. In the case of A. brasilense, which is a most successful and widely used PGPR, it is documented that besides IAA also NO has a pronounced effect on the stimulation of root growth [91].\nIt has been shown in inoculation experiments of mutants, which produced only very low levels of NO, that root morphology was almost not changed in contrast to the inoculation with the NO-producing A. brasilense Sp245 wild type [92]. Similarly, IAA-deficient mutants lost the activity of root growth stimulation. The level of IAA-production could be increased in mutants of A. brasilense SpCd, resistant to the antimetabolite 5-fluor-tryptophan [93]. Inoculation of maize plants in an axenic system with the IAA-overproducing mutant FT326 showed root growth stimulation only at low inoculation densities and very low nitrate levels compared to the wild type inoculation [94]. In a similar way, mutants which show ammonium excretion could be selected from A. brasilense Sp7 by Machado et al. [95] using the antimetabolite ethylenediamine for ammonium assimilation. Using the ammonium-excreting mutant HM053 as inoculant for maize or wheat, nitrogen fixation and N-assimilation in inoculated plants were changed compared to the wild type inoculation [96,97].\nThus, the application of mutations resulting in drastically reduced or increased functions or the production of certain effector molecules are of central importance in the assessment of functional relevance of interaction traits. A detailed collection of physiological properties of Azospirillum spp. by Hartmann and Zimmer can be found in Yaacov Okon's book on Azospirillum\/plant associations [98].\n\n\nOxygen tolerance\nInduction of reactive oxygen species is a key element of defense reaction of plants. Thus, bacteria which approach plants need to be equipped with defense measures against these toxic oxygen species. In the case of the plant endophytic diazotroph Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5, mutants devoid of catalase and superoxide dismutase were unable to colonize rice roots and to establish an endophytic life style [99]. Another oxygen defense mechanism uses O2-diffusion protection by gum production. Consequently, mutants of Pal5 in gum-production lacked endophytic colonization too [100]. In the case of the interaction of the diazotrophic Burkholderia australis Q208 with sugarcane, a downregulation of reactive oxygen production of plants could be demonstrated by RNAseq during colonization by B. australis Q208 [59]. On the bacterial side, LPS- and flagella-production, which are well-known elicitors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns, were reduced in strain Q208 during the root colonization process. Since also strain Q208 harbors the QS-related genes for N-acyl-homoserine production [59], which are usually activated during biofilm production and root colonization, it is quite possible that they are involved in regulatory processes in the physiological changes occurring during root colonization and the interaction with plants (see below).\n\n\n\nBacteria-plant communication with focus on N-acyl homoserine lactones\nBacterial quorum sensing signals are involved in many important ecological functions, like biofilm formation, induction of antibiotic production and virulence. In Gram-negative bacteria N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) were often found regulating these processes through an activation of the luxI\/luxR-type regulatory circuit [101]. It has been shown using AHL-biosensor constructs that the production of AHL-molecules was heavily induced during the colonization of root surfaces by bacteria harboring the luxI\/luxR-type auto-inducing system [102,103]. The auto-induction of AHL-synthesis can be activated already in micro-colonies at the root surface due the spatial accumulation of the AHL-compounds [103]. However, the excreted quorum sensing molecules are not only sensed by neighboring rhizosphere bacteria, but also by the plant hosts [104]. This trans-kingdom signaling induces different responses in the plants, depending on the type of AHLs (diffusible, water-soluble AHLs with short C-side chains or lipophilic, water-insoluble AHLs with C-side chains from 12 to 14 C-units). Water-soluble AHLs are taken up actively into the plant shoots inducing gene expression of antioxidative and xenobiotic degradation genes in roots and shoots as well as phytohormonal changes in the whole plant [105\u2013107]. Also NO-accumulation and membrane hyperpolarization accompanied by increased K+ uptake are early events after AHL application to barley roots [108]. In contrast, water-insoluble AHLs prime the induction of systemic resistance response in the plant hosts [109] and finally confer increased resistance towards biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens in wheat and Arabidopsis [110,111]. The central involvement of QS-regulation in endophytic colonization of rhizobacteria could also be demonstrated, when mutants devoid of luxI or luxR homologous genes were tested for endophytic colonization. For example, a negative mutant for AHL synthesis of the beneficial root endophyte Acidovorax radicis N35 had reduced endophytic colonization abilities. In contrast to the wild type, the AHL synthesis mutant caused induction of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes, which are known to be part of the plant defense response [112]. Thus, the AHL-lacking mutant may not be recognized by the plant as beneficial bacterium. Furthermore, an AHL receptor mutant of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5 was also no longer able to colonize the plant host endophytically, since the QS-coordination was not functioning (Hofmann A and Baldani JI, unpublished results). Thus, QS-signaling in bacteria-plant interactions may not only act through direct interaction with the plant, but also by establishing and coordinating an adapted gene expression of traits like biofilm formation, necessary for endophytic colonization. A. brasilense strain Ab-V5 (originally derived from A. brasilense Sp7T), applied in large scale for about 10\u202fyears in Brazilian agriculture, was recently shown to respond to N-acyl-homoserine lactones (especially 3-oxo-C8-HSL). It showed increased biofilm and exopolysaccharide formation as well as cell motility, because it harbours a luxR, but no luxI homologous gene [113]. Interestingly, while luxI homologues are missing in A. brasilense, they are present in most of the A. lipoferum strains [114]. Transconjugants of Ab-V5 carrying a plasmid with the N-acyl-homoserine lactonase gene abolished the PGPR effect of the wild type. The functionality of so-called luxR-solos reflect the release of AHL-mimic compounds by the plant host [115] or by the accompanying plant microbiome. As one important mechanism of stimulation of plant performance, AHLs induce priming effects, which are specific plant responses in the crosstalk of root-colonizing bacteria with their plant hosts leading to an alert state towards the attack of plant pathogens. It has been shown that a wide variety of molecules can induce priming, besides AHLs also including antibiotically active compounds, like lipopeptides of pseudomonads and bacilli, as well as certain volatile compounds [116,117]. The effects of priming are not visible in the absence of pathogens, but in the situation of pathogen attack, the defense responses are rapid and enhanced.\n\n\nConclusions and further perspectives\nThanks to the great methodological progress in the last two decades, there are now quite some \u201ceye-opening insights\u201d into many structural and functional details of the plant associated microbiome and key interactions between the plant microbiome and the host plant in the holobiont context [118]. However, the complexity of interactions is overwhelming and thus the collection and careful interpretation of further metagenome and transcriptome data needs to be intensified for a deeper understanding. This should be supported by isolation approaches of novel bacteria leading to defined inoculation experiments and testing of functional hypothesis with mutant studies. In addition, the improvement of their environmental fitness and key interaction traits with the plant host (phytohormone production, ammonium excretion) by spontaneous selection or chemical mutagenesis of already established inoculation strains should be considered, since in some cases these appeared quite feasible. The final goal is to implement the knowledge about plant microbiome\/host interactions under field conditions into practical applications. Ideally, this would mean to utilize synergistic effects in \u201csynthetic\u201d holobionts, where a specifically tailored set of beneficial microbes is introduced to plants which have been improved by selection, breeding or genetic modification in supporting the beneficial plant microbiome in a most productive manner. Within the \u201cPlant Phytobiome\u201d concept [119] aiming to integrate biological, soil, climate and agricultural management, a deeper understanding of key interaction and communication processes of the plant and its microbiome within the holobiontic context is urgently needed.\n\n","1690":"\n\nBacteriophages and phage tail-like particles \u2013 relationships and benefits\nRecent studies have provided important insight into so-called phage tail-like particles. The nanoscale size of these structures renders microscopical research challenging, but close relationships to well-studied bacteriophages have helped to develop a clear image. This review presents important scientific discoveries over the past few years about the composition, relationship and benefits of phage tail-like particles, and attempts to sort out the inconsistent terminology that is rich in synonyms. In the second part we provide our own results on the Gram-negative genus Kosakonia to support recent ideas about the complexity of phage tail-like particle-encoding gene clusters, which may allow a previously unexpected wide range of targets.\n\n\nBacteria that contain phages or phage tail-like particles may be used for biocontrol\nNew research has produced evidence that plants cannot survive without bacteria, since bacteria protect plants against filamentous fungi and oomycetes [1]. However, particular strains of bacteria are themselves destructive plant pathogens and cause severe plant diseases, as well as harvest losses in agriculture. In nature the equilibrium between pathogenic, commensal, and beneficial bacteria supports the well-being of plants, whereas in agriculture (particularly in mono-cropping), yield is seriously threatened by pathogenic bacteria.\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria are emerging worldwide and careless use renders broad-spectrum antibiotics ineffective, also in agriculture [2]. Hence, tailored narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be applied in the future, but applicable agents are lacking. Phage therapy proved long ago that bacteriophages (phages) have the potential to close this gap. Phages have not only been applied successfully in humans to cure them of multidrug-resistant bacteria, but also in agriculture to protect crops against plant-pathogenic bacteria [reviewed in 3]. The sensitivity of phages to environmental stressors such as UV irradiation and soil (type, pH, moisture, organic matter content) is still an obstacle to phage therapy on plants, but promising advances have been achieved by combining phages with biocontrol bacteria [3]. Remarkably, not only phages are found in bacteria but also phage tail-like particles, which do not require isolation from the host prior to application, and may thus be employed more easily as promising biocontrol agents.\n\n\nBacteria may suffer from virulent phages and benefit from temperate phages\nPhages are viruses that infect bacteria by injecting their own genome into the host cytoplasm. Phages can be virulent or temperate. A temperate phage differs from a virulent phage in its ability to integrate its genome into the chromosome of the bacterial host. The phage genome is then called a prophage. Since all phages have the potential to lyse the host cell wall it is of crucial importance whether a phage is integrated into the bacterial genome or not. Virulent phages start their lytic cycle by killing the bacterial host cell immediately after injecting their DNA into the host cytoplasm. In contrast, prophages can be vertically transmitted to bacterial daughter cells, possibly providing beneficial traits to the host, and may remain latent for many generations without causing any harm to the host. The prophage remains latent until environmental changes induce the lytic life cycle, where the prophage is excised and expressed, phage progeny produced, and the host cell destroyed. Prophages have played a major role in bacterial evolution by contributing to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture [4].\n\n\nPhage tail-like particles increase interbacterial competition\nThere are different modes of interbacterial competition, but remarkably, two highly efficient bacterial nanomachines have been attributed to derivatives of tailed phages (Fig. 1\n). In both cases subcellular bacterial components resembling fractions of phages confer exceptional qualities to bacteria. The first component is the \u201ctype VI secretion system (T6SS)\u201d, a syringe-like injection apparatus up to several \u00b5m long that penetrates the cell wall of other bacteria (and eukaryotes) in order to inject toxic effector proteins. The second component is the much shorter tailocin. T6SS and tailocin differ from phage in lacking the capsid that carries the phage genome. The suffix \u201c\u2013cin\u201d is used in many antibiotics (e.g. streptomycin) and bacteriocins (e.g. colicin) and refers to their ability to kill bacteria. There are two types of tailocins, the rigid R-type resembling the tail of myophages (contractile tail phages of the family Myoviridae), and the flexible F-type resembling the tail of siphophages. The 0.1\u20130.2\u202f\u00b5m short \u201cR-type tailocin\u201d destroys the membrane potential of other bacteria by puncturing their cell wall, leading to collapse of their proton motive force (Fig. 1).\nAlthough lacking the contractile sheath of myophages, siphophages create channels in bacterial cell walls. Involved in this process is a central tail protein, the TMP (tape measure protein). The working mechanism has not yet been determined, but there are two models: (i) DNA from the phage head forces TMP out of the tail tube, which then penetrates the cell membrane and forms the channel for DNA passage; (ii) opening of the tail at the bottom allows TMP to emerge and the DNA follows [5]. Since F-type tailocins carry neither phage heads nor DNA, model 1 can be excluded for these phage tail-like particles.\nThe following part of this article focuses on R-type tailocins, and although there are several synonyms for tailocins and R-type tailocins, for simplification purposes we use the superordinated terminology suggested by Gill and Young [6].\n\n\nT6SSs and R-type tailocins kill target bacteria by different mechanisms\nT6SS, R-type tailocin and myophage share the contractile tail (which is a central spike-carrying tube surrounded by a contractile sheath), the baseplate and the associated \u201ctail fibers\u201d (TFs). Only recently, T6SSs have been found to possess tail fiber-like appendages located on the bacterial outer surface, also called \u201cextracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae\u201d, that are presumably required for recognizing targets [7] (Fig. 1).\nDue to the similarity to phage tails, T6SSs and tailocins have been termed \u201cphage tail-like particles\u201d [8], which is a technical expression that was coined decades ago [9]. In contrast to phages, phage tail-like particles do not bind to the outer surface of host cells, here more precisely called \u201cproducer\u201d cells, but support producer cells in attacking cells of other bacterial strains, hereafter referred to as target cells or target bacteria. Tailocins are bacteriocins and as such they are supposed, and were repeatedly shown, to inhibit the growth of closely related bacteria. In contrast, T6SSs have been considered to affect distantly related bacteria and eukaryotes (see below). However, there are aberrant observations: recent research has revealed that T6SSs may also be applied for intraspecific [10] and tailocins for intergeneric bacterial competition (see below). Nonetheless, there are important differences between T6SSs and R-type tailocins: (i) functional T6SSs are bacterial producer cell wall-anchored appendages resembling inverted phages and functional R-type tailocins are producer-derived but extracellular particles resembling non-inverted phages; (ii) T6SSs kill bacteria by injecting toxins and R-type tailocins kill bacteria by destroying the proton motive force; (iii) a producer cell can apply T6SSs to protect itself from other bacterial strains, but has to die in order to release R-type tailocins that protect sister cells. Lysis of a few bacterial producer cells supposedly enables R-type tailocin utilization to a colony-benefiting extent, i.e. the bacterial colony sacrifices some cells for the \u201csake\u201d of the population; (iv) T6SSs are much longer than R-type tailocins, since they have to bridge a longer distance: both nanomachines penetrate the cell wall of the target bacterium, but only T6SSs have to also \u201cpenetrate\u201d the producer cell wall and bridge the interbacterial space. Thus, longer T6SSs are favored by the producer, and sheath length is limited only by producer cell diameter [11] (Fig. 1).\nThe T6SS is only one of several (currently nine) described types of bacterial protein secretion systems [12]. These secretion systems have in common that they enable the bacterial producer cell to transport proteins from its cytoplasm into the environment, other bacteria or eukaryotic cells. The bacterial protein secretion systems differ in composition, cargo and origin. The T6SS is the only one proposed to be of (ancient) myophage origin [13].\n\n\nPhage-like protein-translocation structures represent a third group of contractile phage tail-like particles and resemble partly T6SSs and partly R-type tailocins\nBesides T6SSs and tailocins there is a third group of headless phage tail-like particles, the so-called \u201cphage-like protein-translocation structures\u201d (PLTSs) [14]. T6SSs, R-type tailocins (but not F-type tailocins) and PLTSs are contractile phage tail-like particles (CPTPs). While PLTSs resemble R-type tailocins in morphology [15] and in fulfilling their task outside the producer cell, they resemble T6SSs in secreting proteins. PLTSs include \u201cantifeeding prophages (Afp)\u201d [16] and \u201cPhotorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVCs)\u201d [17]. The different names describe the characteristics of PLTSs. The term \u201cprotein translocation\u201d refers to the ability of PLTSs to secrete proteins, which is the main characteristic distinguishing PLTSs from R-type tailocins. Accordingly, Heymann and co-workers called the PLTS a \u201ctoxin-delivery tailocin\u201d [15]. Remarkably, many proteins secreted by PLTSs are insecticides. The term \u201cantifeeding\u201d refers to the impact of PLTSs on herbivore insects, causing cessation of feeding activity. The term \u201cvirulence\u201d has been adopted since PVCs provide the bacterial producer with virulence against insects.\n\n\nThe terminology of contractile phage tail-like particles (CPTPs) is confusing and misleading\nTwo synonyms of CPTPs have been coined that refer to their contractibility: (1) contractile injection systems, and (2) contractile ejection systems. The term \u201cinjection\u201d refers to the ability of many CPTPs to inject substances into target cells; \u201cejection\u201d addresses the ability to eject substances from the producer cell. All CPTPs are ejection systems, but not all of them are injection systems. R-type tailocins eject a target cell-puncturing device, the tail tube [18], but do not inject substances into the target cell [19], except probably the spike (Fig. 1), but this is supposedly not affecting the target or at least not participating as an active component of the functional (proton motive force depleting) R-type tailocin. Nonetheless, the term \u201ccontractile injection system (CIS)\u201d or contractile injection machine has repeatedly been applied lately as a synonym for CPTPs, including R-type tailocins [20\u201323].\nDistinguishing external CIS (eCIS\u202f=\u202fR-type bacteriocins\/tailocins and PLTSs) from internal CIS (T6SSs), as suggested by B\u00f6ck and co-workers [24], makes the terminology even more complicated. Rather than referring to \u201ccontractile phage tail-like particles (CPTPs)\u201d as the generic term for T6SSs, PLTSs and R-type tailocins seems more appropriate. In order to distinguish extracellularly from intracellularly functioning structures one may refer to external and internal CPTPs.\n\n\nCPTPs are manifold and affect all domains of life\nBy attacking insects, Afps and PVCs significantly increase the target spectrum of CPTPs. Bacteria that possess all three types of CPTPs are able to affect important kingdoms in all domains of life. A single bacterial strain may have an impact on other bacteria, archaea, animals (e.g. mammals, insects and nematodes), plants and fungi by expressing CPTP-encoding gene clusters. CPTPs have been found to be involved in shaping polymicrobial communities. For instance deployment of T6SSs was shown to enable simultaneous attack on prokaryotic and fungal rivals [25]. The effect of T6SSs on fungi was not known until recently when Trunk and co-workers found that the T6SS of Serratia marcescens deploys antifungal effectors Tfe1 and Tfe2 against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and two species of the genus Candida. Interestingly, R-type tailocins from Pseudomonas also target strains of other bacterial genera, such as Campylobacter, Haemophilus, Neisseria [reviewed in 26] and Xanthomonas\n[27], suggesting that these bacteria share specific cell surface receptors with Pseudomonas spp.\n\n\nSome CPTPs form complex aggregates\nRemarkably, some bacteria tend to form ordered arrays (or aggregates) of CPTPs within or outside producer cells that are not involved in antagonizing competitors. Two case studies have been reported where a hexagonal arrangement of several CPTPs was observed: (1) the \u201cmetamorphosis-associated contractile structure (MAC)\u201d in Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea\n[28], and (2) the \u201cType VI secretion system subtype IV (T6SSIV)\u201d in Amoebophilus asiaticus\n[24]. The gene clusters of both aggregates are closely related to Afp and PVC, but differ significantly in their function: MACs induce the metamorphosis of marine tubeworms from free-swimming larvae into sessile juveniles, and T6SSIV are produced by intracellular bacterial symbionts of amoebae in order to evade digestion in phagosomes. B\u00f6ck and co-workers hypothesized that either T6SSIV evolved from an Afp\/MAC-like injection system independently of other subtypes of T6SS, or that T6SSIV represents a primordial system from which all other phage tail-like particles and phages have evolved [24]. In either case, referring to this as a completely new secretion system and not as a subtype of T6SS would have helped to avoid confusion in terminology of phage tail-like particles (BOX 1\n).\n\n\nT6SSs and PLTSs may have evolved only once\nT6SSs (subtypes I, II and III together) and PLTSs have supposedly each evolved only once in earth history [14,29]. However, since horizontal transfer of T6SSs [29] and PLTSs [14] is a frequent phenomenon in many prokaryotes, both types of phage tail-like particles can be found in several lineages of Gram-negative bacteria, and PLTSs even in Gram-positive bacteria and Archaea. The R-type tailocin situation appears to be complicated: the common ancestor of PLTSs is sister to a group of R-type tailocins and several myophages [8,14] suggesting that myophages have turned into R-type tailocins repeatedly and possibly vice versa (see below).\n\n\nEnterobacteriophage P2 and R-type tailocins of several Gammaproteobacteria share a common ancestry\nMany temperate phages that are frequently found in Gram-negative bacteria belong to the viral family Myoviridae. A prominent member of this family is enterobacteriophage P2, which was first discovered in, and isolated from Escherichia coli. So-called P2-like prophages constitute a subgroup of Myoviridae and are widespread among enteric bacteria (=members of the family Enterobacteriaceae). Interestingly, the R-type tailocin of Pseudomonas is derived from a common ancestral origin with phage P2 [30]. Nakayama and co-workers stated that the stable gene cluster organization suggests that the R-type tailocin is not a defective phage, but a phage tail that has been evolutionarily specialized as a bacteriocin [30].\n\n\nTailocins are diverse and nested among complete phages in phylogenetic trees\nMany tailocins have been described under genus-specific or even species-specific names. For instance tailocins (both R-type and F-type) of Pseudomonas have been called \u201cpyocins\u201d. This term was already coined in 1954 by Jacob [31] when he discovered an \u201cantibiotic\u201d of Pseudomonas pyocyanea (=synonym of P. aeruginosa). Tailocins appear to be common within Gammaproteobacteria [8] and have been described in many strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae. According to their enteric producers, R-type tailocins have been called xenorhabdicin (Xenorhabdus nematophila) [32], carotovoricin (Pectobacterium carotovorum) [33], enterocoliticin (Yersinia enterocolitica) [34], fonticin (Pragia fontium) and aquaticin (Budvicia aquatica) [35]. It has to be stressed that the allocation of species-specific names to R-type tailocins of closely related taxa is legitimate, since the antagonistic activity of R-type tailocins is often restricted to particular strains of a species.\nRemarkably, not all R-type tailocins are derived from the same evolutionary event, i.e. the \u201ctransformation\u201d of bacteriophages to R-type tailocins (including the loss of the capsid) has likely occurred independently in different species [36]. Phylogenies comprising both tailocin and bacteriophage genes suggest that formation of new tailocins may be a common phenomenon among bacteria. The observation that tailocins are nested among complete phages [8] appears to contradict the statement of Nakayama and co-workers that tailocins are not degenerate prophages (see above). Furthermore, in the genus Pseudomonas several tailocin gene clusters (of both R-type and F-type) have been found to occur in pairs or triplets and to be combined with intact prophages [26]. This might indicate that recombination of tailocins and intact prophages can result in new tailocins and possibly new phages. Comprehensive bioinformatics work will provide important insights into relationships of phages and phage tail-like particles.\n\n\nOccurrence and use of tailocins in plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) such as Kosakonia radicincitans\n\n\nKosakonia radicincitans is a bacterium of the Gram-negative family Enterobacteriaceae with plant growth-promoting properties [37]. The species has been found to be a native endophyte of a large variety of crop plants around the world [38]. Type strain DSM 16656 was repeatedly inoculated into diverse plant species and proved capable of establishing biofilms on roots [39]. Comparison of the genome of DSM 16656 to other fully sequenced genomes of K. radicincitans and closely related bacterial taxa revealed that all to date known members of K. radicincitans exhibit genomic features that are absent from other closely related bacterial species, such as a duplicated flagellar system and an additional type VI secretion system [38].\nThe bacterial rhizosphere community of plants is supposedly plant species-specific [40\u201342]. However, the environment and some microbial keystone species have a large impact on the plant and its associated microbiota [43,44]. The inoculation of K. radicincitans DSM 16656 into tomato plants caused significant changes in the bacterial community composition of roots and shoots [38]. The fact that different bacterial strains compete with each other for plant-created niches in the rhizosphere and the phyllosphere [45] suggests that K. radicincitans might possess exceptional tools for interbacterial competition.\n\n\n\nKosakonia radicincitans has the potential to become a model organism for R-type tailocin and T6SS research\nRecently it was shown that Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656 has six prophages, of which \u201cphage region 2\u201d differs from the other five phages by being highly conserved among strains of both Kosakonia subgroups [38], indicating an important function. Using PHASTER software [46] and our own bioinformatics pipeline for homologous gene detection showed that Kosakonia phage region 2 differs from the other five phages by lacking the capsid-encoding genes, suggesting it might code for a tailocin (Fig. 2\nA) (see Supplementary File 1 for Material and Methods).\nBLASTn searches [47] of Kosakonia phage region 2 showed high homology of this gene cluster to enterobacteriophage P2. Homology of phage P2 and R-type tailocins was previously shown for other Gammaproteobacteria (see above). The capsid locus of phage P2 comprises eight genes that have been replaced by a single hypothetical protein-encoding gene in all ten Kosakonia strains (Fig. 3\n).\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (see Supplementary File 1 for Material and Methods) allowed the screening of bacterial cultures of DSM 16656 for tailocins and revealed nanoscale structures in pure cultures of DSM 16656 outside bacterial cells, which resembled R-type tailocins of other bacteria [e.g. 27] in shape and size (Fig. 2B). While screening Kosakonia cultures, neither capsids nor complete phages could be detected, suggesting that Kosakonia R-type tailocins were found. The Kosakonia R-type tailocins were 130\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fnm long and 20\u201321\u202fnm in diameter; the inner tube was slightly shorter than the complete tailocin and had a diameter of 10\u201311\u202fnm; the contracted sheath was 55\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fnm short and had a diameter of 26\u201327\u202fnm.\n\n\nTailocin-producing bacteria may increase bacterial target ranges by having multiple tailocin gene clusters or combining several tail fiber genes in the same tailocin gene cluster\nThe host range of phages and the target range of tailocins are determined by bacterial cell surface receptors and receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) on tail fibers. This applies to both phage tail fibers and tailocin tail fibers. The larger the diversity of tail fibers and RBPs, presumably the wider is the target range. Already in 1992, Hagg\u00e5rd-Ljungquist postulated the horizontal transfer of tail fiber genes (TF genes) as one of five methods for extending the host range of phages [48], and T\u00e9tart and co-workers reported that tail fiber genes respond to strong selection pressure by homologously recombining gene fragments between unrelated phages [49]. Williams and co-workers demonstrated that chimeric tail-fibers, where the variable C-terminus of P. aeruginosa was replaced by tail fiber C-termini of different phages, showed a killing spectrum broader than the host range of the phage [50].\nTwo tailocin gene clusters within one genome have been reported in rhizosphere-occupying bacteria that encounter a large variety of bacterial competitors [51,52].\nUntil recently it was believed that a single tailocin gene cluster usually has one TF gene and one associated chaperon (although a recombination of R-type and F-type tailocin was found in the same tailocin gene cluster, carrying TF genes of both types [26]), but three TF genes in a single tailocin gene cluster have only been reported for Pseudomonas chlororaphis by Dorosky and co-workers [52]. Generating different gene deletion mutants, the authors found distinct killing spectra for bacteria possessing different TF genes.\nThe discovery of Dorosky and co-workers was presumably the first and to date only report of three TF genes in a single tailocin gene cluster. However, Fig. 3 shows that several strains of the genus Kosakonia also have three TF genes. The analysis revealed that there are three different TF genes and two associated tail fiber assembly genes (chaperones) in the R-type tailocin gene cluster of Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656. The comparison of the DSM 16656 genome to genomes of other Kosakonia strains unveiled that some strains share the three TF genes with DSM 16656 or \u201creplaced\u201d one of them by another TF gene, while other strains have evolved less complex TF loci and exhibit only the minimum number of genes, i.e. one TF gene and one chaperone (Fig. 3).\nFuture analyses of other bacterial taxa should show whether having three TF genes is an exceptional or a more widespread phenomenon than currently known. K.radicincitans DSM 16656 carries its three TF genes on three separate operons, indicating that differential expression of the three genes is possible and potentially triggered by different niches and associated microbes. In future, combined microscopic, gene expression and gene mutation analyses will help elucidate the spectrum and limits of tailocin diversity in Kosakonia species.\n\n\nClosely-related bacteria may have different tailocins pointing to different target spectra\nComparing DSM 16656 with other strains of Kosakonia revealed that closely-related strains of the same bacterial genus may all possess a highly conserved tailocin gene cluster, which only differs significantly in number and composition of TF genes. Comparison of ten different Kosakonia strains revealed a hyper-variable locus within the R-type tailocin gene cluster where highly diverse TF genes have evolved. Four strains of Kosakonia radicincitans (from Germany (DSM 16656), China (Ola 51 [53], GXGL-4A [54]), and Argentina (YD4) [55] share all three TF genes and differ only in gene sequence identity, whereas two other strains of the same species s.l. (here referred to as the K. radicincitans group) from Malaysia (UMEnt) [56] and Philippines (REICA_142) [57] lack all three TF genes but have each acquired another TF gene and another chaperone with no homology to the DSM 16656 tailocin genes. In the three considered strains of the closely-related K. sacchari group, one TF homolog of DSM 16656 is missing, but two strains acquired an additional TF gene [58\u201360]. This large diversity of the TF locus appears even more remarkable in the light of the highly conserved major tail sheath and major tail tube genes that share more than 95% of their gene sequence among all ten investigated Kosakonia strains. A comparison of the three TF protein sequences of Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656 showed that these genes are highly conserved at the N-terminus (68.6% identity within the first 153 aa of the consensus sequence), and are very variable at the C-terminal end (8.7% identity within the last 219 aa of the consensus sequence). This indicates that the three tail fiber proteins may have different target ranges. The position of the conserved fraction of the TF genes is indicated in dark blue in Fig. 3.\n\n\nAre Gram-negative bacteria more competitive than other bacteria?\nWhile T6SSs and tailocins have only been found in Gram-negative bacteria, phage-like-protein-translocation structures (PLTSs) have also been discovered in Gram-positive bacteria and even in Archaea. However, this is supposed to reflect horizontal transfer of PLTSs from Gram-negative bacteria to other prokaryotic groups [14]. Hence, regarding the modification of phages for bacterial purposes Gram-negative bacteria seem to be a few steps ahead of other prokaryotes.\nHaving three T6SSs and an R-type tailocin with up to three distinct TF genes, Kosakonia radicincitans is a suitable species for studying T6SSs as well as R-type tailocin evolution and function. Tailocins with more than three TF genes have not been reported yet and three or more than three type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) may occur in less than 2% of bacteria (as inferred from: \u201cT6SSs occur in only one quarter of bacteria\u201d [61] and \u201conly 7% of T6SS-containing bacteria possess three or more T6SSs\u201d [29]).\n\n\nKosakonicin appears to be an appropriate term for the Kosakonia R-type tailocin\nTailocins are \u201chigh molecular weight bacteriocins\u201d, in which the term \u201cbacteriocin\u201d refers to the ability to kill closely related bacterial strains. The naming of a particular bacteriocin is not derived from the sensitive target strain but from the producer strain. This is the first report on the genus Kosakonia producing tailocins. Since all investigated Kosakonia strains exhibited the same R-type tailocin gene cluster, the term \u201ckosakonicin\u201d seems to suit all of them. However, since the kosakonicin gene cluster varies between the different Kosakonia taxa in the TF locus, considering species-specific names, such as \u201cradicincicin\u201d and \u201csaccharicin\u201d, might be justified.\n\n\nTailocin specificity: Why do tailocins predominantly kill closely related bacteria?\nPhages bind specifically to cell surface receptors of their bacterial host. The specificity remains high over time due to co-evolution of phage and host. If a tailocin evolves by transition from a phage, the target range has to change from self to niche-competing bacteria. It has been shown for Pseudomonas that R-type tailocin-producing strains are typically resistant to the R-type tailocins they release [62]. Instead, tail fibers bind to different strains of the same species or closely related species, which have evolved from a common ancestor [49,52]. The target recognition mechanisms of tailocins have been analyzed mainly for R-type tailocins from P. aerigunosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia: The tailocin fiber genes encode receptor-binding proteins at their C-terminus that bind to specific bacterial surface components, which are very often lipopolysaccharide (LPS) residues [63,64].\nFuture studies should show whether a particular tailocin gene cluster that may have existed for millions of years (as it is probably the case in the genus Kosakonia) is still predominantly addressing closely related strains. Taking into account that (i) any new tail fiber gene may broaden the range of target bacteria, and (ii) tail fiber genes may be horizontally transferred or duplicated prior to evolving into different directions, it remains to be tested whether the Kosakonia R-type tailocin is also able to affect distantly related bacteria. In vitro studies of Kosakonia spp. and other bacteria will help unravel the antagonistic potential of this genus. Assuming that each TF gene allows binding to, and killing of another bacterial strain competing for the same niche, it follows that the more distinct TF genes a bacterium has, the more niches it can putatively occupy.\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nThe fact that 95% of all phages carry tails despite of the metabolic cost of building these structures implies that tails must provide phages with a tremendous evolutionary advantage [5,42]. Bacteria have supposedly taken advantage of this ideal device by transforming the phage tail into phage tail-like particles. However, whether tailed phages or phage tail-like particles evolved first remains unknown.\nSince tailed phages and phage tail-like particles share the ability to penetrate bacterial cell walls, both components could be applied as pharmaceutical or biocontrol agents against pathogenic bacteria. The application of tailored or even engineered biocontrol bacteria possessing specific phage tail-like particles for antagonizing plant pathogens is a challenging goal for the future. The interaction between bacterial cell surface receptors and receptor-binding proteins on tail fibers is extremely complex [65]. If one manages to find tight correlations between tail fiber genes and cell surface receptors of target bacteria this will pave the way for selecting appropriate candidate bacteria from strain collections and molecular engineering of phage tail-like particles as a promising tool to combat pathogenic bacteria.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics requirement\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1691":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compelling question of \u201chow microorganisms and microbial communities contribute to the feeding of the world\u201d gains in importance and becomes an exciting frontier of research. The way of interaction between the plant corms and its inhabiting microbial community mainly defines the well-being, growth and finally yield and quality of crop products. Therefore, this special issue compiles main aspects of plant-microbe interactions which were raised at the international symposium \u201cThe Plant Microbiome: Exploration of Plant-Microbe Interactions for Improving Agricultural Productivity\u201d held in El Gouna-Hurghada, Egypt, in November 2018. The conference (https:\/\/www.pgpmicrobiome2018.com\/) was organized within the framework of Alexander von Humboldt Foundation symposium series, and in cooperation with the German Research Foundation-DFG, German Academic Exchange Service-DAAD, the Technical University of Berlin-Camps El Gouna, the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops-IGZ, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science-JSPS, and Cairo University and its Journal of Advanced Research-JAR.\nSustainable crop production worldwide needs novel methods and production systems which help to reduce mineral fertilization and agrochemical applications to protect soil fertility and water quality. Microbial communities or selected organisms may contribute to such improved future plant production systems. In the present special issue main aspects of plant microbial communities composition, their functioning, plant colonization strategies and competition as well as novel methods used to deeper understanding these complex systems are reviewed.\nWhile molecular genetic and metagenomic techniques have revealed the great diversity and functional richness of resources of the plant microbiota, as it is highlighted in the review of Hartmann et al, cultivability of these communities and isolation of novel plant growth-promoting microbes is lagging very much behind. Nevertheless, successful agricultural applications of plant beneficial microbes and possibilities to improve their effectiveness were already achieved. The review of Sarhan et al. aims to better resolve the plant microbiome repertoire and it\u2019s in vitro cultivability. The retrieval of the missing unculturable plant microbiota will significantly promote the potential utilization and ability for applications in tomorrow's agriculture.\nCompant et al. highlight in their review the importance to understand the functioning of selected microbial strains or mixed communities to further improve environmental tailored and plant species adapted biological preparations and microbial inoculants. That topic is further deepened in the aspect of archaeal functioning in the plant Eruca sativa by Gabriele Berg. Hrynkiewicz and coworkers evaluate how specific salt-tolerant diazotrophic nitrogen fixing bacteria promote the development and survival of halophytic plants in adverse salt impacted areas. The daily agricultural practice clearly shows the increasing market demand of biological products and their successful application in many examples. Unfortunately, there is still a big gab in the understanding of variations observed in application efficiencies. One of the most important topics for a successful biofertilizer or biopesticide application is the ability of the respective microorganisms or microbial groups to colonize the plant and express a high competence to the native microbial community. In the present special issue, factors influencing these properties are reviewed by Schlechter et al. and Akifumi et al. More specific bacterial traits, which are supporting the colonization ability and competence against native bacteria living in the same environment of the plant, are investigated and reviewed by Patz et al. The volatiles-based crosstalk between the plant, a beneficial mycorrhizal fungus and a root pathogen is shown in the article of Dreher et al. Furthermore, improved colonization of a plant beneficial bacterium can be stimulated by the application of osmolytes at salt-challenged conditions as reported by Cruz et al. Future studies of complex functional microbe-plant interactions need the consequent and efficient use of molecular genetic techniques and their rapid improvement. Here, we provide a short selection of novel methodological ideas described by Huschek and Witzel. The critical review of Fricke et al. highlights the tremendous challenges of sequencing-based microbiome studies, and points to eye-opening novel insights as well as methodological pitfalls and limitations.\nIn this special issue, we bring together summarized information on major achievements and challenges of microbial applications in agricultural practice for improving sustainable production systems. Some new ideas and techniques were highlighted, which may inspire scientists working in this area.

In modern diets, arugula (Eruca sativa Mill.) stands out due to its peppery, pungent taste that stems from various glucosinolates and other sulphur-containing compounds in the edible parts [1]. In addition to their flavour, isothiocyanates that are formed during the degradation of glucosinolates are thought to be involved in cancer prevention [2]. Arugula belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is commonly known as rucola (or garden rocket); it originated in the Mediterranean and has been cultivated at least since Roman and ancient Egyptian times [3]. In traditional medicine, arugula is used as a medicinal plant to treat disorders of the digestive system and has several other medical indications as well as aphrodisiac properties [4]. Moreover, various cultivars are broadly accepted in Western cuisine, where they are used in their raw form in various types of salads. Arugula has also been associated with Salmonella Thompson outbreaks causing severe illnesses in humans [5]. Therefore, it is important to understand the entire arugula microbiome because its structure, network and function as well as its colonization stability are crucial factors affecting outbreaks and the functioning of the holobiont [6]. To date, various important plant species-specific microbial key players have been identified; however, the focus of most studies is on bacterial and fungal communities. For example, the bacteriome of various Brassicaceae plants, including E. sativa, was previously identified [7,8]. It was shown that the phyllosphere of arugula harbours higher proportions of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than its rhizosphere and the surrounding soil [8]. However, details related to archaeal communities associated with Brassicaceae plants and their functioning still remain largely unknown.\nArchaea have been identified as interactive components of complex microbiomes, such as those in the environment or associated with the gastrointestinal tract of animals, the gut and skin of humans and even the rhizosphere and endosphere of plants [9\u201312]. However, the function of archaea and their structural interactions with their host and other microorganisms remain mostly unclear, mainly due to methodological limitations. On plant hosts, Archaea have been found to colonize the rhizosphere and the endosphere at high abundances, whereas the phyllosphere is less colonized [13,14]. These different colonization patterns are influenced by different abiotic conditions but also by biotic factors, such as competition and interactions with bacteria and fungi [11,15]. Recent studies on the natural vegetation of alpine bogs revealed that the plant genotype also influences colonization by Archaea. On bog vegetation Archaea were further found to have the potential to interact with plants. These potential interactions based on functions such as plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, nutrient supply, and protection against abiotic stress were identified by metagenomic mining [12]. Although factors influencing archaeal functionality in rice roots have been analysed [13], the interactions of archaea with cultivated plants remain mostly unclear. However, due to the ubiquitous occurrence of archaea and their important functions in healthy natural vegetation, Archaea presumably play a role in cultivated plants.\nThe objective of our study was to analyse the colonization patterns of Archaea with respect to micro-niche specificity on a widespread leafy green plant and to further increase our understanding of their role and functionality in plants in general. In addition, we aimed to fill gaps in our understanding of the microbiome-host interactions between Archaea and plants. Therefore, we analysed the specific archaeal communities of each habitat (soil, rhizosphere, and phyllosphere) of E. sativa grown under non-intensive horticultural conditions. Samples were obtained from home gardens (Graz, Austria) and analysed with a complementary approach combining metagenomics and targeted sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene fragment.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nSampling of arugula plants and isolation of total-community DNA\nArugula plants were grown in garden soil (hereafter referred to as bulk soil) in a suburban region of Graz (Austria; approx. 47\u00b04\u203213\u2033N, 15\u00b028\u203219\u2033E). Plants were watered by above-ground irrigation with a water hose. Plants were harvested in their final stage of leaf development in July. The plant leaves and their short stalks (edible plant parts) are called the phyllosphere throughout this paper when referring to the microbial habitat. In addition to the phyllosphere samples, rhizosphere samples were collected separately from the same plants, and bulk soil was included as a reference material. For each of the sample types, five equal specimens were obtained. All samples were stored on ice and immediately processed after arrival at a nearby laboratory. To homogenize the samples, 5\u202fg of plant material or bulk soil per replicate was physically disrupted with a sterile mortar and pestle, re-suspended in 10\u202fmL of 0.85% NaCl, transferred into two 2\u202fmL Eppendorf tubes and subsequently centrifuged (16500g, 20\u202fmin, 4\u202f\u00b0C). The obtained pellet was used to isolate the total-community DNA with a FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All DNA extracts were stored at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C until further processing.\n\n\nPreparation of the 16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon library for high-throughput sequencing\nCommunity DNA extracted from the soil, rhizosphere and phyllosphere habitats of arugula plants was subjected to PCR-based barcoding. The approach entailed a nested PCR, with the archaea-specific primers 344f and 915r [16] in the first PCR and the modified primer pair S-D-Arch-0349-a-S-17\/S-D-Arch-0519-a-A-16 (hereafter 349f\/519r) [17] containing an additional 10\u202fbp primer pad (TATGGTAATT\/AGTCAGCCAG) and linker (GT\/GG) in the subsequent PCR, as previously described in protocols of the Earth Microbiome Project [18]. In a third PCR, the Golay barcodes were annealed. The first PCRs (20\u202f\u00b5L) comprised 4\u202f\u00b5L of GC buffer (7.5\u202fmM), 2\u202f\u00b5L of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10\u202fmg\/mL), 2\u202f\u00b5L of dNTP mix (2\u202fmM), 0.25\u202f\u00b5L of Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany; 2 U\/\u00b5L), 9.55\u202f\u00b5L of PCR-grade water, and 0.6\u202f\u00b5L each of forward and reverse primers (10\u202f\u00b5M). Amplifications were conducted with the following settings: 95\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin, followed by 10 cycles of 96\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs, 60\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs, and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, 15 cycles of 94\u202f\u00b0C for 25\u202fs, 60\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs, and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin, and a final elongation step at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. The nested PCRs with primers 349f and 519r were executed in the same way as the previous PCR but with different settings: 95\u202f\u00b0C for 5\u202fmin, followed by 25 cycles of 95\u202f\u00b0C for 40\u202fs, 66\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin, and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fmin and a final elongation step at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. A final barcode-annealing PCR was conducted to attach sample-specific Golay barcodes to the primer pads on each forward and reverse primer, with the following settings: 95\u202f\u00b0C for 2\u202fmin, followed by 10 cycles of 95\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs, 56\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs, and 72\u202f\u00b0C for 30\u202fs and a final elongation step at 72\u202f\u00b0C for 10\u202fmin. Amplified PCR products were checked by gel electrophoresis after each PCR, and 1\u202f\u03bcL of PCR product from the previous PCR was used as a template for the subsequent PCR. All PCRs were conducted in triplicate, purified with a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, USA), and pooled in equimolar concentrations prior to sequencing. The sequencing was then conducted using an Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (GATC Biotech AG, Konstanz, Germany).\n\n\nBioinformatic analyses of archaeal 16S rRNA gene fragments\nThe generated 16S rRNA gene Illumina library reads were analysed and processed by using the open source software package Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) release 1.9.1 for pre-processing and pre-filtering, and QIIME2 release 2018.2 [19] was used for further analysis following tutorials provided on the QIIME2 homepage (https:\/\/docs.qiime2.org\/2018.2\/). First, the read quality was checked with FastQC, and barcodes were extracted in QIIME 1.9.1. Then, reads and metadata were imported into QIIME2, in which demultiplexing, denoising of truncated reads, and generation of ribosomal sequence variants (RSVs) were conducted using the DADA2 algorithm [20]. The RSVs were then summarized in a feature table and rarefied to a depth of 1000 RSVs. Feature tables subjected to additional filtering were used to calculate metrics of alpha and beta diversity, including the Shannon diversity index, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, evenness, the Jaccard index and the Bray-Curtis distance, with the QIIME2 core diversity metrics. For phylogenetic analysis, the MAFFT script was used to align representative sequences, and FastTree was used to generate a phylogenetic tree. For taxonomic composition analysis, the taxonomy was assigned to representative sequences by using a customized na\u00efve Bayes classifier trained on 16S rRNA gene OTUs clustered at 97% similarities within the Silva 128 database [21]. In addition, 2D principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots were constructed using Emperor weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances. The distribution of taxa among the habitats was visualized with Cytoscape 3.3.0 [22] based on habitat-specific core archaeomes, which were identified by using a frequency threshold of 0.8 (present in 4 out of 5 samples). The most abundant sequences, which were showing a low taxonomic resolution, were further assigned by using nucleotide BLAST (https:\/\/blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Blast.cgi).\n\n\nArchaea-targeting functional metagenomics\nShotgun-sequenced datasets were available from a previous study [8] that utilized arugula plants from the same garden (repository IDs were provided in the respective section). The datasets (phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil) were used to explore the plant\u2019s bacteriome and the functioning of the enterobacterial subpopulation therein. In the present study, functional and taxonomic analyses were performed on the Metagenomic RAST server (MG-RAST; http:\/\/www.mg-rast.org). Quality-filtered reads from HiSeq Illumina runs were uploaded to the server and initially processed with default parameters. The reads were filtered for artificial replicate sequences, low-quality sequences, short sequences, and sequences containing ambiguous bases. The filtered sequences were then annotated using hierarchical classification with default parameters: SEED subsystems as an annotation source, a maximum e-value of 10\u22125, a minimum identity of 60% and a minimum alignment length of 15 measured in aa for protein and bp for RNA databases. Each subsystem within the metagenomes represents a group of sequences encoding for a specific biological process or a structural complex. Furthermore, the metagenomes were screened for functional signatures annotated to Archaea within MG-RAST. The functional hits were subsequently exported and normalized to the lowest number of sequences containing predicted proteins with known function from the soil habitat (8,400,892 sequences). Then, the structure and abundance of the functional signatures were visualized using MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN) 5 [23]. For taxonomic analysis, the structure of the archaeal community was aligned and annotated with the M5nr database as a reference and exported via the MG-RAST application programming interface (API) server (http:\/\/www.mg-rast.org).\n\n\n\nIn situ visualization of Archaea with confocal laser scanning microscopy\nArchaeal colonization of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere samples of E. sativa was analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH\/CLSM). The microscope used for the imaging was a Leica TCS SPE confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with Leica ACS APO 40.0\u202f\u00d7\u202foil CS and Leica ACS APO 63\u202f\u00d7\u202foil CS oil immersion objective lenses. Plant tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1x phosphate-buffered saline (3:1) for 6\u202fh at 4\u202f\u00b0C. For each habitat, three fixed replicates were analysed. The samples were then stained by in-tube FISH according to Cardinale and colleagues [24]. The FISH probes ARCH344-Cy5, ARCH1060-Cy5 [25], and ARCH915-Cy5 [26] and an equimolar mixture of Cy3-labelled EUB338, EUB338-II, and EUB338-III [27,28] were used to visualize colonization patterns of Archaea and bacteria, respectively (max. extinction\/emission in nm, Cy3: 548\/562 and Cy5: 650\/670). As a positive control for visualization of Archaea, a culture of Candidatus Altiarchaeum hamiconexum was used. To visualize the structure of the plant, Calcofluor white staining was conducted (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) using a stationary laser at a 405\u202fnm wavelength. Further maximum projections of optical z-stack slices were used to generate micrographs of archaeal and bacterial colonization.\n\n\nRepository deposition of next-generation sequencing data\nThe metagenomes are publicly accessible on the MG-RAST server (http:\/\/www.mg-rast.org) under the accession numbers mgm4551355.3 (phyllosphere), mgm4551391.3 (rhizosphere), and mgm4551574.3 (bulk soil). All amplicon sequencing data sets were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ena) and are accessible under the project accession number PRJEB28404.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nArchaeal diversity in arugula plants\nQuality-filtering of the 16S rRNA gene fragment dataset of E. sativa resulted in 1668 features (RSVs) with a total abundance of 1,040,565. The 16S rRNA amplicon analysis included three habitats: soil (413,055 reads), the rhizosphere (146,847 reads) and the phyllosphere (470,663 reads). Alpha diversity was analysed by phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic based methods; outliers were excluded (n\u202f=\u202f4). The highest diversity of Archaea was found in the soil habitat (Shannon index (H): 4.44; Faith: 83.06), followed by the rhizosphere (H: 3.95; Faith: 71.63) and the phyllosphere (H: 3.56; Faith: 52.47) (Fig. 1\n).\nWeighted and unweighted PCoA plots with all 15 samples revealed a distinct clustering of archaeal communities belonging to each of the habitats (Fig. 2\nA and B). In the phyllosphere (77.8%), rhizosphere (73.4%) and soil (74.2%), the archaeal community was dominated by Thaumarchaeota. The second most abundant archaeal phylum throughout all habitats was Euryarchaeota, totalling 15.1% in the phyllosphere, 20.9% in the rhizosphere, and 15.3% in the soil. Archaea assigned to the phyla Woesearchaeota (phyllosphere: 0.4%; rhizosphere: 3.0%; soil: 7.1%) and Bathyarchaeota (phyllosphere: 0.1%; rhizosphere: 0.2%; soil: 0.1%) were less represented. However, 4.0% of all sequences remained unassigned. Overall, at the genus level, the most abundant feature was assigned to Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus (27.8%), as further revealed by BLAST analysis. Other abundant genera were assigned to an uncultured Thaumarchaeota strain (14.2%) and to Methanosarcina thermophila (8.8%). The most abundant taxa were shared among all three habitats, representing the core archaeome of arugula (Fig. 3\n). Taxa shared exclusively between two habitats were found only between the soil and the rhizosphere. Unique taxa, i.e., those found exclusively in one habitat, were detected in the soil and (to a lesser extent) in the rhizosphere. All taxa found in the phyllosphere were also present in the other habitats.\nThe three metagenomes revealed a different taxonomic structure than the 16S rRNA amplicon dataset (Fig. 4\n). The relative archaeal abundance was highest in the soil, at 0.7% (48,603 sequences) of all prokaryotic sequences (7,396,616 sequences). The relative abundance of Archaea was slightly lower in the rhizosphere, at 0.5% (45,140 sequences) of all prokaryotic sequences (9,822,615 sequences). The lowest archaeal abundance was found in the phyllosphere, accounting for 0.1% (5949 sequences) of the total prokaryotic community (8,531,239 sequences). At the phylum level, the distribution of the archaeal community was similar in all habitats, whereas the dominant archaeal group was Euryarchaeota, accounting for 67.1\u201374.5% of all archaea. In contrast to the results from the 16S rRNA gene fragment dataset, Thaumarchaeota accounted for only 10.5\u201315.6% of archaea, followed by the phylum Crenarchaeota, which accounted for 13.0\u201314.8%. At the class level, Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria were the most abundant taxa, representing 27.0\u201331.8% and 15.6\u201318.5% of archaea, respectively, followed by Thermoprotei (11.6\u201312.6%) and unclassified Thaumarchaeota (10.5\u201315.6%). Thermococci, Methanococci, Methanobacteria, Archaeoglobi and Thermoplasmata were less represented. Similar to the results for the 16S rRNA gene fragment dataset, the relative abundance of unclassified reads was high, ranging from 7.4\u20138.8% of archaea.\n\n\nVisualization of archaeal communities of arugula\nArchaeal colonization patterns in the phyllosphere and the rhizosphere of E. sativa plants was visualized using a FISH\/CLSM approach (Fig. 5\n). In the analysed phyllosphere samples, small archaeal colonies were spatially distant from each other, mainly forming colonies in close proximity to plant stomata (Fig. 5A). The colonies were clearly separated from each other and mostly consisted of fewer than 100 individual cells. In contrast, larger colonies were found in the rhizosphere (Fig. 5B). These colonies were also found to be embedded within large bacterial biofilms. Archaeal colonies were mainly found on lignified plant parts and especially on rotten roots. Bacteria that were labelled with a different fluorescent dye were visualized with the same approach. These bacteria often co-localized with archaeal colonies in the rhizosphere but not in the phyllosphere and were predominant in the plant samples.\n\n\nMetagenome-based functional analysis of Archaea associated with arugula\nFrom the three normalized metagenomes, functional analysis resulted in 5804 archaeal sequences. These sequences were assigned to certain functional subsystems of the SEED database (Table 1\n). Most of the sequences were assigned to primary metabolic functions of Archaea, such as carbohydrates (4161 hits; 71.7%), including central carbohydrate metabolism (1706 hits; 29.4%) and polysaccharides (2115 hits; 36.4%), and cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments (621 hits; 10.7%). Functions involved in one-carbon metabolism (657 hits; 11.3%) and fermentation (21 hits; 0.4%) were also found. Furthermore, archaeal functions were assigned to subsystems involved in nutrient cycling, such as functional signatures for CO2 fixation (400 hits; 6.9%), whereas signatures for nitrogen fixation were not detected. Functions assigned to cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments were mainly involved in the pyrimidine deaminase pathway (535 hits; 9.2%). A high proportion of archaeal functions were also assigned to subsystems involved in glycogen degradation (1022 hits; 17.6%) and DNA metabolism, especially DNA replication (472 hits; 8.1%). In contrast, functions involved in RNA metabolism were less represented (86 hits; 1.5%). In addition, functional signatures involved in response to stress, especially oxidative stress (17 hits; 0.3%), and signatures involved in protein degradation (215 hits; 3.7%) were also found.\nFurthermore, the habitat specificity of archaeal functions in E. sativa was analysed. To do so, the functional distributions of the normalized metagenomes were compared among the habitats. In general, most assigned functions belonged to the soil habitat (48.8%), followed by the rhizosphere (36.2%) and the phyllosphere (15.0%). Functional signatures involved in glycogen degradation, and amino acids and derivatives were found at a higher relative abundance in the soil than in the other habitats, with representations of 40.6%, and 4.0%, respectively (Fig. 6\n). Additional functions involved in CO2 fixation and DNA replication were similarly distributed in the soil and the rhizosphere with a representation of 7.4% and 8.8% in the soil and 7.7% and 9.0% in the rhizosphere, respectively, whereas the relative abundance of these functions in the phyllosphere was below 3.7%. Functions involved in fermentation were not found in the phyllosphere. Further, functions involved in stress response and oxidative stress were represented in low relative abundance in the phyllosphere (0.2%), compared to the soil (0.4%) and the rhizosphere (0.2%). The only exceptions included signatures assigned to one-carbon metabolism, more precisely the serine-glyoxylate cycle, the TCA cycle, and the biosynthesis of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which were more represented in the phyllosphere (28.1%, 10.6%, and 17.9%) than in the soil (6.0%, 5.3%, and 7.4%) and rhizosphere (11.6%, 6.8%, and 8.2%).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we found various indicators for Archaea to be important components of the microbiomes of plants domesticated by humans. In E. sativa, Archaea exhibited a habitat-specific structure, colonization patterns and functions. Similar to the ways in which biotic and abiotic factors shape bacterial and fungal communities, the archaeome is likely also affected by its environment. Each plant habitat is affected by different environmental conditions, such as low nutrient availability and exposure to environmental changes in the phyllosphere; the availability of root exudates in the plant rhizosphere; and the more stable conditions in the soil. These conditions might be among the factors influencing the habitat-specific diversity of Archaea. In the present study, the highest archaeal diversity was found in soil samples, and the lowest diversity was found in the phyllosphere. Furthermore, the composition of the archaeal community at the phylum and class levels was similar among the habitats, which was also observed in the metagenomics analysis. However, the predominant lineages in the metagenomics dataset, namely, Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, were inverted in the 16S rRNA gene fragment dataset. Overall, the metagenomics shotgun-sequencing approach revealed a more diverse taxonomy than the 16S rRNA gene fragment amplicons. This bias was described previously and can occur due to differences in database entries and errors during PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing [29]. In general metagenomic sequencing reveals a higher richness than the 16S rRNA approach, whereat the 16S rRNA approach additionaly misses 10% of yet uncharacterized Archaea, showing the limitations of the accurate identification of microbes within a microbiome [30,31].\nAn in-depth analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment dataset with a feature network highlighted the habitat-specific colonization of plants by Archaea. Soil samples exhibited the greatest number of habitat-specific features. However, the rhizosphere also harboured unique features, whereas the phyllosphere had no unique features. Overall, a large core archaeome was shared among the habitats, with the most abundant taxa assigned to Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus, a member of the ammonium-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) that plays an important role in nitrification processes and is expected to possess key genes associated with protection from abiotic stress [32]. Archaea assigned to Methanosarcina, Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum and Woesearchaeota were also abundant in the core archaeome. These lineages were previously found in animal digestive tracts, sediments, and the human gut, respectively [33\u201335]. Methanogens are strict anaerobes; therefore, the detection of Methanosarcina in the phyllosphere might be explained by anaerobic niches in the phyllosphere or, more likely, by contact between the plant and animals, as arugula was grown under field conditions [36]. The visualization of archaeal colonization of E. sativa revealed a habitat-specific distribution of the overall population. In the phyllosphere, we found small scattered colonies, whereas in the rhizosphere, Archaea formed larger colonies and colonies in close proximity to or even within bacterial biofilms without any obvious zone of inhibition. No negative interactions between archaea and bacteria have been observed to date, suggesting mostly synergistic relationships between the two groups [37]. Moreover, Archaea were found to accumulate in nutrient-rich hotspots such as rotten roots, indicating that they play a direct or indirect role in decomposition processes. In Finnish forests, Archaea and Thaumarchaeota were previously found to be active components of the decaying wood microbiota [38].\nThe arugula archaeome harboured specific archaeal functions mainly assigned to central carbohydrate metabolism and polysaccharides. We also found functional signatures involved in nutrient cycling such as CO2 fixation but no signatures involved in nitrogen fixation, although E. sativa was mainly colonized by AOA. These findings are in accordance with our previous study on Archaea associated with bog vegetation [12]. Arugula has low nutrient requirements, therefore we hypothesize that archaea are not selected by arugula in order to complement the nitrogen balance of the holobiont. In the current study, we also detected functions involved in glycogen degradation, even at higher relative abundances. Glycogen is used by fungi as a main storage unit and is also excreted by them as part of common exudates. This relationship indicates potential interactions with fungi, as fungal exudation rates and fungal colonization were previously shown to be correlated with archaeal abundance [39]. Functions involved in response to stress, especially oxidative stress, were less represented, which might be due to the specific micro-environments of arugula examined. The highest abundances of functional hits for Archaea were found in the soil and rhizosphere, whereas the phyllosphere was relatively low in sequences corresponding to archaeal functions. This discrepancy indicates that soil and the rhizosphere are the preferred habitats of Archaea and the habitats with the highest archaeal metabolic activity. Functions that were relatively more abundant in the phyllosphere were involved in the serine-glyoxylate cycle and assigned to \u201cserine-pyruvate aminotransferase\/archaeal aspartate aminotransferase\u201d (EC 2.6.1.51) and \u201cputative malate dehydrogenase\u201d (EC 1.1.1.37). \u201cSerine-pyruvate aminotransferase\u201d is involved in the glyoxylate cycle, which enables the utilization of simple carbon sources when complex and energetically more valuable carbon sources (e.g., glucose) are absent [40], as is the case in the phyllosphere.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nArchaea might show less functional adaptation to agricultural plants such as E. sativa than to their wild ancestors due to differences in genotype and the environment. These differences include altered nutrient and energy levels in the soil caused by introducing fertilizers and the accompanying phenotypic changes of plants. Since Archaea are adapted to energy deficiency, stress and energy limitations, they might lose their advantage over bacteria in terms of environmental tolerance and subsequently be outcompeted by bacteria, which focus on exploiting energy-rich resources. In summary, Archaea are small but potentially important niche-specific components of plant microbiomes, and therefore, we must advance our understanding of plant-associated Archaea before they disappear [12] due to our agricultural practices.\n\n","1693":"\n\nThe birth and development of in vitro cultivation and pure culture studies\nSince the discovery of microorganisms, in vitro cultivation and isolation of bacteria in pure cultures has represented one of the major pillars in developing the science of microbiology. Introducing their pioneer work on the germ-disease theory, both Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, and their associates, were able to present their nutrient broth \u201cBouillon, N\u00e4hrfl\u00fcssigkeit\u201d and solid culture media, together with single colony isolation and pure cultures studies [1]. The well-known solid culture media consisting of meat extract, peptones and agar, were developed by the 1890s. With extensive progress in selectivity profiles, diagnostic properties, chromogenic reactions, pre- and selective enrichment power, culture media were the main tools to estimate viable counts, enrich, select and differentiate groups of bacteria. In addition, individuals were isolated in pure cultures to identify, study properties, test for secondary metabolites, and determine the genetic composition (britannica.com\/science\/pure-culture) [2,3]. Further environmental adaptation techniques are discussed in the section \u201cFrom synthetic to environmental cultivation of microbiomes\u201d.\n\n\nFrom plate count anomaly to candidate phyla\nNutrient agar and many other derived culture media, with their major components of meat extract and peptone developed for the isolation of pure isolates of human pathogens, have been continually used for culturing various types of microbiomes irrespective of the nature of their environments, whether humans, animals or plants [4\u20136]. Additionally, many of the earlier methods continued to be used, while discovering the major differences between the numbers of cells from natural environments that form viable colonies on agar media and the numbers observed by microscopy. This observation noted at the dawn of microbiology [7] was called \u201cthe great plate count anomaly\u201d by Staley and Konopka [8], and continued to be researched by microbiologists over the years [9\u201312]. The phenomenon was brought sharply into focus, leading to the realization just how diverse and unexplored microorganisms are, as a result of analyzing microbial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU or 16S rRNA) gene sequences directly from environmental samples [13].\nHistorically, until the mid-1980s, most of the available microbial ecology knowledge was based on cultivation techniques and microscopy or enzyme activities measured in laboratories after substrate induction [14]. Then, Muyzer et al. [15] introduced the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique, designed to separate specific PCR-amplified gene fragments, to analyze microbial communities without the need of culturing microorganisms. As a procedure, DNA samples extracted directly from the environment were targeted to amplify gene regions such as 16S rRNA for bacterial or ITS regions for fungal communities. Concomitantly, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was introduced to produce fingerprints of microbial communities [16]. The emergence of improved sequencing techniques, and the entailed increase of database-stored sequence information in combination with the development of in situ hybridization probes provided new methods for microbial community profiling, especially in the 90s, like the full-cycle or cyclic rRNA approach [17\u201319].The major limitation of these methods, including the 16S rRNA gene-based high throughput sequencing of PCR amplicon libraries and the PhyloChip microarray technology of 16S rRNA amplicons to oligonucleotide probes hybridization [20], is the PCR-biased amplification efficiency. This is affected by sample origin, DNA extraction method, primer specificity, and the proportion of target genes within the sample background, which usually favor highly abundant targets [21]. Nevertheless, data obtained by these methods revealed that members of the \u201crare\u201d biosphere are actively attracted by specific environments, and may play an important role despite their low abundance [22].\nNewer next generation sequencing techniques (NGS) did enable and simplify metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches that partially alleviate the PCR-related problems for just a single or a combination of taxonomic\/phylogenetic marker genes by sequencing all genomic variants within an environmental sample [23]. This results in a highly comprehensive dataset of sequenced microbial reads representing genomic fragments or transcripts, that aimed to be assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and\/or specific genes, to describe microbial taxonomic diversity and to estimate functional variety or activity of a certain taxonomic level, optimally of single strains. Although progresses have been achieved in extracting DNA\/RNA from environmental samples to reduce contamination and increase purity, there are still limiting factors: (i) restrictions in sequencing methods (e.g. error rate); (ii) direct assignment of reads to their corresponding genes; (iii) gene assembly with the risk of chimaera production among other problems, and (iv) the quality and availability of annotated genes and gene families in the databases; which often lead to genes of unknown functions and consequently to unknown taxa [24].\nTo overcome the issues above, a huge variety of bioinformatic tools have been developed to prioritize read quality control and processing (e.g. FastQC, FastX, PRINSEQ, Cutadapt), contamination filtering (e.g. BMTagger), and chimaera detection (e.g. Uchime2). Further tools are applied to assign a specific read to its corresponding gene or protein, function or taxon, that can be alignment-based (e.g. BLASTn\/x, DIAMOND, LAST, RAPSearch2) or alignment-free (e.g. KRAKEN); the latter mostly uses k-mers to minimize database inadequacies. Currently, comprehensive tools for taxonomic and\/or functional classification of reads are exemplified by MEGAN6, MG-RAST, MetaPhlAn2 and Qiita. Notably, some of these metagenomic tools (e.g. MEGAN-LR) deal with the output of long-read sequencing techniques, such as of Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) [25]. Those gains of interest in metagenomic research are due to the fact that taxonomic and its functional annotation do not rely anymore on single genes covered by multiple short reads (approx. 50\u2013300\u202fbp) and their gene copy number issues (e.g. 16S rRNA) but on multiple genes covered by long reads, with an average read length of 5 to 50\u202fkb, whereof approx. 50% of the reads are larger than 14\u202fkb [26].\nContinuous advances in high throughput genomic sequencing technologies, metagenomics and single cell genomics, have contributed new insights into uncultivated lineages. Several of the known microbial phyla, \u223c120 bacterial and 20 archaeal phyla, contain few cultivated representatives (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi). Moreover, phyla composed exclusively of uncultured representatives are referred to as Candidate Phyla (CP) [27,28]. Such uncultivated majority, approx. 90 bacterial candidate phyla, defined as microbial dark matter and exist in various environmental microbiomes [6,29\u201331]. Remarkably, metagenomics and microbiome analyses have detected so many candidate phyla, and phylogenetic analyses have revealed such a close relationship among many of them that the term \u201cCandidate Phyla Radiation\u201d (CPR) was coined for a group of uncultured bacteria that share evolutionary history [32\u201334].\nThe number of newly discovered candidate phyla is increasing due to further developments in metagenomic techniques and continual updating of genomic databases, and representing a striking challenge to the scientific community [27,35]. With increased metagenomic sampling and analysis, taxonomic boundaries and nomenclature are constantly being reassessed. Meanwhile, scientists have realized that bacterial and archaeal phyla without a single cultivated representative comprise the majority of life\u2019s current diversity [27,32,34]. Certainly, the current knowledge about the microbial world, not only the substantial roles played by microorganisms in the function of the biosphere but also their reservoir of novel bioactive compounds, is profoundly challenged by what have been cultivated in the laboratory [35]. So far, physiologic and genomic information has been confined to pure cultures and dominated by representation of the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteriodetes within the Bacteria and of methanogens and halotolerant members of the Euryarchaeota within Archaea [36].\n\n\nFrom synthetic to environmental cultivation of microbiomes\nToday, it is established that culture media tailored for in vitro cultivation of microorganisms, including CP microorganisms, must provide environmental and nutritional conditions that resemble their natural habitats, combined with long incubation times [37]. Further attempts towards improving culture media to grow novel species depended mainly on supplementing macro- and micronutrients in the medium as well as manipulating cultivation conditions (Table 1\n). Conspicuous developments and higher throughput methods have been applied to marine and terrestrial environments (Fig. 1\n, Table 2\n), adopting a number of approaches reviewed by Epstein et al. [38]: for example, lowering nutrient concentrations in standard media together with longer incubation [39], diluting to extinction to minimize the influence of fast growers and facilitate growth of oligotrophs [40], co-incubating cells individually encapsulated into microdroplets under low flux nutrient conditions [41], adding signaling compounds and\/or co-cultivation to trigger microbial growth [42,43].\nNovel in situ cultivation techniques, e.g. diffusion chambers, have been introduced to mimic natural conditions and provide access to critical growth factors found in the environment and\/or supplied by neighboring species. This allowed the cultivation of variants that otherwise would not grow ex situ\n[12]. Some of the resulting chamber-reared populations were spontaneously lab-domesticated to acquire the ability to grow in vitro\n[65]. Undoubtedly, the newly advanced cultivation technologies have unraveled the existence of new species en masse. However, microbiologists should be able and continue to minimize the gap between the microbial richness in nature and the number of species in culture, for the benefit of both basic and applied microbiology [12].\n\n\nCulturomics in place and the progress achieved\nRealizing the imperative importance of bringing more bacterial isolates of environmental microbiomes into cultivation, the strategy of \u201cculturomics\u201d was introduced by the group of Didier Raoult and Jean-Christophe Lagier [5,71\u201373]. They developed a high throughput strategy of cultivation to study the human microbiota using matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and\/or 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing to identify the growing colonies. The principals of culturomics are based on the diversified and multiple combinations of various growth media, culturing conditions, atmospheres and times of incubation, that were reduced to only 18 culture conditions to standardize culturomics, and to complement the culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses (reviewed in Lagier et al. [72]; Table 3\n). The extensive application of MALDI-TOF-MS for rapid and high throughput identification of rare and new species allowed the group to dramatically extend the known human gut microbiome to levels equivalent to those of the pyrosequencing repertoire. Lagier et al. [71] identified\u202f>\u202f1000 prokaryotic species, thereby adding\u202f>\u202f500 species that represent\u202f>\u202f50% increase in the total number of microorganisms known in the human gut. Furthermore, they were able to extend culturability of archaea without an external source of hydrogen to recover human archaeal species [74].\n\n\nThe dawn of plant-based culture media\nAlthough the results obtained with culturomics of human gut microbiome are immense and represent a success story, it did not draw much attention from research groups of the plant microbiome. Here, the compelling question is \u201cshould plant microbiologists follow the steps of human microbiome culturomics and continue using general microbiological media containing nutrients of animal origin (e.g. nutrient agar and R2A, LB)?\u201d The answer from plant endophytes themselves is illustrated in the graphical abstract. Plants, as a holobiont, intimately interplay with their surrounding biota [43\u201345]. They enter in a number of multiple interactions which are efficiently orchestrated via plant physico-chemical influences, mainly the root system \u201cThe Black Box\u201d (Fig. 2\n). Such complexity of the plant holobiont is amplified when considering the multiplicity of plant interfaces and the high diversity of colonizing dwellers. From the plant side, organs represent multi-layer platforms for docked microorganisms; e.g. the roots constitute, from inward to outward, endorhizosphere, rhizoplane, and ectorhizosphere. Likewise, the leaves incorporate endophyllosphere, phylloplane, ectophyllosphere, as well as caulosphere (stems). Additional compartments develop throughout the plant life, i.e. anthosphere (flowers), carposphere (fruits), and spermosphere (seeds). Correspondingly, the plant microbiome is of great diversity of both prokaryotic (Bacteria, Archaea) and eukaryotic (fungi, oomycetes, and other protistic taxa) endophytes [75,76]. They are able to colonize below- and above-ground plant organs, and exercise profound positive (mutualists), negative (pathogens) and\/or neutral\/unidentified (commensal endophytes) impacts on plant nutrition and health. The picture is getting more complicated and even fascinated considering interaction between bacterial and fungal groups inside the plant itself, and ability of microbial groups of other environments, e.g. human pathogens, cross-bordering and adapting to the plant environments [77\u201379].\nStudies emerged regarding the use of various plant materials as supplements to the general synthetic microbiological culture media, e.g. nutrient agar and R2A (Table 1, Table 4\n). Chemical analyses of dehydrated powders of fully-grown plants, legumes and non-legumes, illustrate the very rich and complex nutritional\/chemical matrix of plants, which is very much imprinted on the root environment (Fig. 3\n) [80,81]. They contain copious sources of nutritional macromolecules, proteins and carbohydrates, major and minor elements, amino acids and vitamins: a composition that is nearly impossible to tailor in one single or a general synthetic culture medium recommended for common cultivation of the plant microbiota that are used to enjoy such in situ nutritional milieu. Therefore, serious efforts were made to introduce and research natural culture media based on the plant, and its inhabiting microbiota, as a sole source of nutrients, in the form of juices, saps and\/or dehydrated powders [80\u201387] (Fig. 2). For ease of application and practicability, the packaging of plant powders in teabags was recommended to further be used in the preparation of plant infusions necessary to formulate the plant medium [81]. The nutritional matrix, in terms of complexity, diversity and concentration of the prepared plant-only-based culture media, compared to standard culture media, was rich and compatible enough to satisfy growth of the plant microbiota, i.e. in vitro cultivation and in situ recovery.\nThe various forms of plant-only-based culture media supported excellent in vitro growth of hundreds of tested bacterial isolates [80\u201382,84\u201387] (Fig. 4\n). They represented 89 species of 23 families belonging to the big four phyla of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, and Actinobacteria (Fig. 4, Table 5\n). In addition, batch cultures of liquid culture media based on various plant materials, slurry homogenates, juices and\/or dehydrated powders of various cultivated and desert plants, supported excellent biomass production (ca.\u202f>\u202f108 cells ml\u22121) of a number of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). The doubling times of tested Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Azospirillum brasilense were comparable to standard culture media, if not shorter [80,86,87]. Interestingly, cell survivability in such batch cultures of plant media was maintained for longer times compared to standard culture media.\nExamples of efficient production of microbial biomass and metabolites from culture media based on plant substrates and by-products of agro-industries exist in the literature, e.g. green biorefinery of brown and green juices [92,93]. Recently, the development of \u201cplant pellets\u201d for instant preparation of plant-based culture media for cultivation and biomass production of rhizobia, in terms of dry weight and optical density was successfully proceeded (data under review). Formulations of plant pellets were based on mixtures of Egyptian clover powder (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) together with supplements of agro-byproducts, glycerol and molasses. Such plant pellets are considered a cost and labor-effective scheme for lab and industrial use, satisfying requirements for production of agro-biopreparates.\nThe tested plant-only-based culture media supported in situ recovery of plant microbiota colonizing the ecto- and endorhizospheres. Reproducible results were obtained with all of the tested cultivated maize, clover, barley, as well as desert plants, ice plant and cacti [80\u201382,84\u201387]. Remarkably, the plant-based culture media supported higher percentages of culturability of endophytes [80\u201382,84\u201387]. The CFUs that developed were well-defined and distinct macro- and microcolonies, compared to the bigger, undefined, slimy and creeping colonies grown on standard nutrient and soil extract agar media [80\u201382,84\u201387]. Compared with the total bacterial numbers, based on qPCR analysis using the universal primers of Lane [94], and calculations of Klappenbach et al. [95] and Schippers et al. [96], the culturable population, in terms of total CFUs, were higher on plant-only-based culture media (20\u201370%) than on standard culture media (2\u201318%) [80\u201382,84,85]. Such obvious increases in culturability are probably attributed to the distinguished development of microcolonies, percentages exceeded 30% of the total colonies, together with prolonged incubation time. This resembles other cultivation strategies reported to boost the development of such microcolonies, e.g. the use of over-lay agar plating techniques, diffusion chamber-based technique, encapsulation of cells in gel microdroplets and soil slurry membrane systems [41,63,97].\nCulture-dependent DGGE fingerprinting of 16S rRNA gene of endophytes, grown on agar plates, clearly clustered the group of band profiles of plant-based culture media away from the tested standard culture media, and in the case of maize and barley joined with culture-independent bacterial communities of intact plant roots [80,81]. The plant-only-based culture media with their unique diversity and complexity of nutrients supported higher values of alpha diversity, an observation that was confirmed earlier by supplementing culture media with natural nutrients, e.g. soil extract [98]. This provides clear evidence on the highly relatedness\/closeness of the culturable population developed on the plant-only-based culture media to the in situ population of endo-rhizosphere of clover and maize.\nFurthermore, Saleh et al. [84] introduced specific plant-based-seawater culture media for successful recovery of the microbiome of halophytic plants grown in salt-affected environments of the Mediterranean basin. This culture medium increased culturability (>15.0\u201320.0%) compared to the conventional chemically-synthetic culture medium supplemented with (11.2%) or without (3.8%) NaCl. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, representative isolates of prevalent halotolerant bacteria were closely related to Bacillus spp., Halomonas spp., and Kocuria spp. Remarkable improvement in culturability of endophytic fungi and bacteria was also reported by the use of plant-supplemented culture media [99\u2013103]. Moreover, dehydrated powders of leguminous seeds successfully replaced the beef extract in the selective MRS culture medium, and supported better growth of probiotic bacteria of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus lactis\n[104].\nIt was evident that the use of plant-only-based culture media successfully extended the range of cultivability among rhizobacteria of Lucerne. Such plant-based culture media enabled the successful recovery of its specific micro-symbiont, namely Sinorhizobium meliloti, which require multiple growth factors, e.g. amino acids\/vitamins [105], naturally present with balanced amounts in the plant medium, compared to obscure quantities in the yeast extract added to the standard culture media of YEM, LB, and TY [105]. Cultivability was further extended to fastidious and hard-to-grow and\/or not-yet-cultivated members. This included non-rhizobia isolates whose cultivation require very rich media supplemented with a variety of growth factors, e.g. Novosphingobium, requiring casein hydrolysate, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, thiamine, glycine, asparagine and glutamine [106]; Pedobacter, requiring tryptone, yeast extract, and NH4Cl [107], and Lysobacter, requiring yeast extract, in addition to antibacterial and antifungal drugs inhibiting other microorganisms [108].\n\n\nUnculturability and candidate phyla in the plant microbiome\nThe main reason behind unculturability of certain microorganisms is their own genetic make-up that confers the metabolic, physiological, and ecological potentials. In that sense, unculturability might be attributed to two main reasons: first, the auxotrophic nature of microbes with minimal genomes and restricted anabolic capacities [32]. This auxotrophy may range from minimal levels, lacking single or a few critical elements, e.g. vitamins, co-enzymes, a few amino acids, to maximal levels, e.g. absence of entire metabolic pathways such as biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. Assuming that a bacterial strain lacks only one gene (or gene cluster) for synthesizing a particular organic compound, this particular compound may be added to the culture medium to enable growth. However, the number of genes lacking, i.e. the degree of auxotrophy of a bacterium, determines the possibility of generating a strain-supplementing culture medium. Second, the oligo-\/prototrophic nature, where microbes with large genomes and complex metabolism, are capable of synthesizing the majority of their nutritional needs but have restricted replication mechanisms, i.e. maintain single or double rRNA operons (rrn). It is reported that rrn copy number is a reliable and generalized proxy for bacterial adaptation to resource availability [109,110].\nSarhan et al. [85] analyzed the overall phyla abundance of the culturable maize root microbiome developed on plant-only-based culture media. They demonstrated significant enrichment of the candidate phyla BRC1, Omnitrophica (OP3), Atribacteria (OP9), Dependentiae (TM6), Latescibacteria (WS3), and Marinimicrobia (SAR406), on mixed agar plates (Fig. 4 in Sarhan et al. [85]). This is in addition to the enrichment of some representative OTUs belonging to AC1, FBP, Gracilibacteria (GN02), Hydrogenedentes (NKB19), Parcubacteria (OD1), Aminicenantes (OP8), Armatimonadetes (OP10), Microgenomates (OP11), Ignavibacteriae (ZB3), WPS-2, and WS2 (Fig. S5 in Sarhan et al. [85]). The significant enrichment of all of such candidate phyla and diverse OTUs on the plant-based culture media, even as mixed cultures, is a strong indication of the complexity and diversity of nutrients in such media that most likely fulfill the nutritional requirements, and mimic conditions that prevail in their natural habitat, as symbionts [111]. This is also confirmed by the successful isolation and recovery of some taxa of candidate phyla radiation (CPR), Candidatus Phytoplasma, and TM7, by tedious efforts to construct a complex culture media to satisfy their nutritional requirements [112,113].\n\nUltra-small bacterial and archaeal cells\nSome groups of Bacteria and Archaea produce ultra-small cells (also called ultramicrobacteria, UMB) with diameters\u202f<\u202f0.5\u202f\u00b5m (often\u202f<\u202f0.3\u202f\u00b5m) and genomes\u202f<\u202f1\u202fMb [114,115]. Such UMB recently showed considerable overlap with bacterial Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) [32,116]. These prokaryotes have lost many genes underlying the biosynthesis of such metabolites that can be easily taken up, depending on either symbiotic partners or freely available compounds in the surrounding community. These uptake abilities can compensate for missing nucleotides, lipids, and amino acid biosynthesis pathways [27,117]. Although this minimization of genomes and cell sizes appears to contradict the \u201crationale\u201d of evolution, it can provide several benefits to bacteria, such as evading host immunity of animals or plants, and Rhizophagy [118,119]. It is also reported that the smaller the cell the easier the transit through plant cell walls, e.g. Candidatus Phytoplasma [120].\nRemarkably, free-living organisms have been found to be among the ultra-small prokaryotes, but there is evidence that many of them are ectosymbionts or reliant on amoebal hosts [27]. Consistently, UMB were found to express abundant pili, which may be necessary for interacting with other organisms or the environment via adhesion to extracellular surfaces [27]. Another important feature of UMB, that hinder their cultivation, is the low numbers of ribosomes, which in turn allow only low growth rates [114]. Due to such slow growth rates, UMB cannot compete with fast growing bacteria on nutrient-rich media. In general, the likelihood of isolating and culturing UMB can be considered to be low for strains that rely mainly on host or microbial community metabolism. However, alternative cultivation approaches have successfully been applied for culturing few strains that were previously thought to be unculturable. Interestingly, plant-only-based culture media were able to enrich such UMB phyla (Dependentiae (TM6), Gracilibacteria (GN02), Omnitrophica (OP3), Parcubacteria (OD1), and Saccharibacteria (TM7)) among the maize root microbiome [85]. Such a group of phyla were reported among the low abundance bacterial groups in various environments [116].\n\n\nLarge genome sizes and culturability\nOn the contrary, a large genome size does not inevitably imply easily culturing, but rather, possibly complicate the cultivation demands. Various genomic and physiological characterization studies of candidate phyla revealed examples of large genomes with comprehensive metabolic capabilities. Such capabilities are contrary to recently analyzed genomes of several candidate bacterial phyla, which have restricted anabolic capacities, small genome size, and depend on syntrophic interactions for growth [121]. In contrast, these large genomes possess single or limited copy numbers of rrn, which in turn is reflected in slow cell growth rates. It is also reported that the number of rrn in bacterial genomes predicts two important components of reproduction: growth rate and growth efficiency [110]. This implies that the growth rate of bacteria positively correlates with rrn copy numbers, i.e. bacteria that possess multiple rrn have higher growth rates and shorter doubling times than those with single or double operons [95,110]. An example is the candidate phylum OP10 \u201cArmatimonadetes\u201d, which have a genome of \u223c5.2\u202fMb and the majority of metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of fatty acids, purines, and pyrimidines, but lack some TCA and histidine biosynthesis enzymes. Despite this relatively large genome size, it possesses a single split rrn\n[122].\nSuccessfully, the first isolate of OP10 was cultivated on one hundred-fold diluted Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) culture media [123]. Another OP10 isolate was enriched and isolated from reed plants using minimal media supplemented with ground plant roots as a carbon source (Table 4) [91]. In general, OP10 isolates do not require any unique substrate for their cultivation, but only prolonging cultivation (\u223c30\u202fdays) and low-nutrient media. Hence, colonies of OP10 fail to grow on high-strength nutrients (higher than 1.5\u202fg of total organic carbon per liter) such as nutrient agar, TSA, or LB media [124].\nAnother striking example is the candidate phylum WS3 \u201cLatescibacteria\u201d, which maintains a relatively large genome of \u223c7.7\u202fMb, and encodes numerous biosynthetic capabilities and a rich repertoire of catabolic enzymes and transporters, with the potential to utilize a variety of substrates [121]. This bacterial phylum lacks a single representative isolate, and has an anaerobic nature and predicted slow growth rate due to possessing a relatively large genome and a single rrn. However, OTUs of such phyla have been enriched in vitro among the bacterial phyla of maize roots using plant-only-based culture media for cultivation (Fig. 4 in Sarhan et al. [85]). Another situation is the phylum Verrucomicrobia, which have been isolated on oligotrophic culture media containing potato rhizosphere extracts. Such plant-enriched culture media recovered the highest CFU counts in general, and microcolonies in particular, at least seven-fold more effectively than recovery observed on R2A [88]. Moreover, Akkermansia muciniphila, the previously unculturable human gut bacterial strain, has been enriched among the plant microbiome of maize roots on plant-only-based culture media [85]. In general, such phylum were reported to require prolonged incubation periods, since their doubling time ranges from 7 to14 hours, and analysis of their genome, \u223c5.2\u202fMb, revealed anaerobic metabolism as well as a single rrn\n[125].\n\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nSpecific culturomics strategies based on the plant-based culture media and multi-omics-derived information are the future keys to discover novel members of plant microbiomes, and hidden secrets of their multi-interactions with host plants. These proposed strategies would lead to recovering novel taxa of critical ecological niches, i.e. plant-beneficial microbes and plant-pathogens, revealing mechanisms of plant-microbiome adaptation and co-evolution, and help to understand complex microbe-microbe network interactions. This is not only to enable cultivation of the not-yet-cultured highly abundant core microbial members, but also to mine for less abundant species, which can empower and facilitate plant microbiome engineering for future improvement of plant fitness and yield production.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1694":"\n\nIntroduction\nBacterial endophytes have attracted considerable attention because of their capability to promote plant growth through direct or indirect mechanisms [1,2]. Many bacterial endophytes can support host plants by counteracting negative impacts in the environment and are classified as plant growth-promoting endophytic bacteria (PGPEB) [3,4]. Colonisation by PGPEB is essential for providing benefits to host plants. Endophytic colonisation involves the entry, growth and proliferation of bacterial populations within the plant [2,5]. The colonisation patterns of PGPEB in plant tissues are strongly dependent on several biotic and abiotic factors [6,7]. Moreover, rhizosphere microbial communities and metabolic pathway profiles may be entirely different from those of endophytes [8]. Hence, variations in abiotic factors such as temperature [9], soil type [10], pH [11], and nutrients availability have been described to influence bacterial plant colonisation behaviour. Especially, soil salinity alters bacterial community composition and their functional activities [5,12,13]. Thus, bacterial endophytes may help the plant to withstand such sudden osmolarity peak conditions in their ecological niche.\nOrganic osmolytes enable organisms to adapt to environmental conditions by protecting cells or molecules against salt stress. These organic osmolytes are generally \u2018\u2018compatible\u201d with the metabolism of the cell without adversely affecting macromolecules or physiological processes and are referred to as compatible solutes [14]. Solutes accumulate either by synthesis or by transport from the extracellular medium through osmotically regulated transporters and mechanosensitive channels [15]. Moreover, compatible solutes provide beneficial enzyme functions, protecting against high temperature, desiccation, salinity, freeze-thaw procedures and even drying [16\u201318]. Among these, intracellular solutes such hydroxyectoine is well known in halophytic bacteria [19,20] and is considered a protein protectant [21]. Despite these benefits, the effect of hydroxyectoine enrichment in bacterial cells on bacterial plant colonisation behaviour is so far missing.\nTo date, four genomes of endophytes belonging to Kosakonia radicincitans have been completed and published [22\u201324]. Isolation procedures of these strains revealed their endophytic capacity in different crops such as wheat, maize, banana and yerba mate. Within these isolates, the endophytic capability of the Gram-negative bacterium Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656T (syn. Enterobacter radicincitans) [25], formerly Pantoea agglomerans has been previously demonstrated [26]. K. radicincitans was isolated from the winter wheat leaves of the temperate regions [27]. Additionally, this facultative endophyte is known to stimulate the growth and yield of a range of plant hosts such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays) and radish (Raphanus sativus), among others [26,28\u201330]. The strain is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen biologically, solubilise calcium phosphate and to produce phytohormones such as auxins and cytokinins [31\u201333]. Finally, there already exists an efficient commercial product \u201cAbiVital\u201d, which increases crop yield and even fruit quality parameters of radish and tomato plants [28,29,34].\nThe course of nutrients use including the phosphorus uptake emphasises the necessity to stimulate its availability during early plant growth stages and the endophytic establishment [33,35]. Thus, beyond the well-documented plant growth promoting benefits of this bacterial strain, and its inorganic phosphate solubilisation capability, the response of this endophyte to both the osmotic stress and the accumulation of compatible solutes, and how these conditions may influence its phosphate solubilisation ability and subsequent plant colonisation activity are still unknown. Here, we hypothesised that providing exogenous hydroxyectoine during the adaptation at high salinities in culture media may synergistically influence the phosphatase enzymes of K. radicincitans, enhancing its physiological machinery for phosphate solubilisation and subsequent plant colonisation activity.\nMembers of the Brassicaceae family are economically important crops, which the benefits of associated bacterial endophytes have tested successfully [36]. Previously studies demonstrated the ability of K. radicincitans to colonise internal tissue of Brassicaceae species such as radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) [29], independently of the site of application. Radish has features that favour the assessing of effects caused by environmental variables such as the short growth cycle (24\u201330\u202fdays), small size enabling a large number of treatments, easy determination of growth parameters and nutrient uptake from soil [37]. In particular, radish easily responds to the application of PGP and especially P-solubilizing bacteria with leave and tuber growth improvement and P-uptake responses [38]. Therefore, this plant was selected as a model for testing plant growth-promoting and endophytic activity of pre-conditioned cells. Thus, this research investigates the effects of osmotic stress and hydroxyectoine accumulation in K. radicincitans DSM 16656T cells as endophytic bacteria model on the radish colonisation capability and P-solubilising activity.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nCompatible solute standard hydroxyectoine (H-ectoine) was acquired from Sigma Aldrich (Cat: 70709, Sigma Aldrich Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany). All other materials used were of analytical reagent grade and used as received.\n\nBacteria and growth conditions\nThe bacterial strain K. radicincitans DSM 16656T was provided by the Leibnitz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops in Grossbeeren, Germany. Chemically defined growth medium (DM) was routinely used (g\u202fL-1): glycerol (15), yeast extract (8), K2HPO4 (2.74), KH2PO4 (1.31), MgSO4 7H2O (0.5), FeSO4H2O (60\u202fppm), MnSO4 (10\u202fppm) at pH 7.4. Pre-conditioning of bacteria before plant colonisation assays was carried out by amending the DM with NaCl [1, 4%] and providing hydroxyectoine [1\u202fmM] to DM 4% NaCl.\nBacterial suspensions for plant colonisation experiments were prepared as follows: DM (100\u202fmL) was poured into 250\u202fmL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks that were autoclaved at 121\u202f\u00b0C under 1.5\u202fatm, for 30\u202fmin. The initial inoculum concentration in the media was adjusted at 106\u202fcells\u202fmL\u22121. The cultures were maintained at 190\u202frpm in a rotary incubator at 30\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C (IKA KS 4000 IC Control, Staufen, Germany). Hydroxyectoine were sterilised separately by filtration through a 0.2\u202f\u03bcm membrane filter (Durapore\u00ae 0.2\u202f\u00b5m polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Actively growing cells were harvested at the exponential phase after 20\u202fh (OD600 of 0.7\u20130.9) by centrifugation at 6875g for 15\u202fmin (Centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, Wesseling, Germany), and the obtained pellet of bacteria was washed and centrifuged twice with corresponding NaCl solution [1, 4%] to maintain the osmotic pressure. The three bacteria type treatments [NaCl 1%, 4% and 4%\u202f+\u202fH-ectoine] were stored in the same NaCl solution adjusted to OD600\u202f\u223c\u202f1.0 until use in plant colonisation assays. The intracellular hydroxyectoine concentration before endophytic establishments experiments was determined via HPLC [39].\n\n\nMineral phosphate solubilisation in liquid media\nThe efficiency of K. radicincitans of both pre-conditioned osmoadapted cells and osmoadapted hydroxyectoine-added cells for phosphate solubilisation were measured via Pikovkaya\u2019s (PVK) liquid media (pH 7.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2) [40]. PVK media were amended with 4% NaCl and 4% NaCl plus hydroxyectoine [1\u202fmM] to reveal the effects of osmotic stress and the osmolyte on bacterial phosphate solubilisation ability. Each flask containing 100\u202fmL of PVK was inoculated with 100\u202f\u00b5L of bacterial suspension at 108\u202fcells\u202fmL\u22121. The flasks were incubated for approximately nine days at 30\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C under shaking at 190\u202frpm on a rotary shaker (IKA KS 4000 IC Control, Staufen, Germany). Four independent replicates per treatment were tested. Quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of the soluble phosphate was performed at 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh, 120\u202fh and 200\u202fh according to a standard protocol [41]. In parallel, the influence of osmotic stress and the addition of hydroxyectoine on pH evolution in PVK medium was monitored online, using microtiter plate cultivations (MPCs) (RoboLector-BioLector system, m2p-labs, Baesweiler, Germany). The following adjustments were used: Scattered light (620\u202fnm filter, gain 3), pH-optode (Filter pH[HP8] Ex (nm)\u202f=\u202f470\u202fnm; Em(nm)\u202f=\u202f525, gain 7), and 1000\u202f\u03bcL of PVK media incubated in 48-well MTP-48-BH flower- plates, Lot No: 1808 at 30\u202f\u00b0C and 1200\u202frpm.\n\n\nPhosphatase enzyme activity\nPhosphatase activity was determined using p- nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (PNPP, 0.025\u202fM) as a colourimetric substrate. For the assay, 2\u202fmL of 0.5\u202fM modified universal buffer (MUB) buffer adjusted to pH 6.5 (acid phosphatases) and 11 (alkaline phosphatases), and 0.5\u202fmL of the substrate were added to 0.5\u202fmL of PVK supernatant medium. Cell-free supernatant samples were obtained by centrifuging 2\u202fmL of culture at 21382g for 10\u202fmin (Mikro HT 200R, Hettich GmbH & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). Reactions were carried out at 37\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u00b0C for 60\u202fmin and stopped by the addition of 0.5\u202fmL of 0.5\u202fM CaCl2 and 2\u202fmL of 0.5\u202fM NaOH. Samples were filtered by using filter paper (grade 401) retention time 12\u201315\u202f\u00b5m pore size. The p-nitrophenol (PNP) formed was measured spectrophotometrically at 400\u202fnm (Genesys 10S UV\u2013Vis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) [42]. Four independent replicates per treatment were tested. Controls including the chemical hydroxyectoine were analysed under the same experimental conditions. The unit of enzyme activity (U) were expressed as micrograms of PNPP released per millilitre per hour (\u00b5g\u202fmL-1h\u22121) and normalised to dry biomass (mg) produced after 24\u202fh.\n\n\nPromotion of radish plant growth by osmoadapted K. radicincitans cells\nThe effects of both osmoadaptation and the inclusion of hydroxyectoine into K. radicincitans on plant growth promotion were tested under glasshouse conditions. Radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. sativus) seeds of cultivar Rondar (an F1 hybrid; S & G GmbH, Kleve, Germany) were used in all experiments. Radish inoculation with osmoadapted bacterial cells and hydroxyectoine-added cells was conducted by immersing radish seeds into a bacterial suspension (108\u202fcells\u202fmL\u22121) for 5\u202fmin. Afterwards, 10 inoculated seeds were placed in pots (10 pots per treatment), filled with 1.5\u202fL of a 1:1 (v\/v) quartz-sand soil mixture (Fruhstorfer Erde type T25: P2O5: 200\u2013300\u202fmg\u202fL-1, Hawita Gruppe GmbH Vechta, Germany). The pots were then placed randomly on trivets to avoid transfer of bacteria between individual pots [29]. Seeds treated with NaCl solution [1, 4%] were used as controls. Seedlings were irrigated manually with 50\u202fmL of tap water per day (conductivity 0.005\u20130.05 S\/m). Plants were maintained under natural light conditions in the glasshouse at an average temperature of 18\u202f\u00b1\u202f4\u202f\u00b0C and an air humidity >45%. At one and four weeks post-planting, the plants were harvested.\nOne-week-old seedlings samples from three different locations per pot were taken, rinsed thoroughly with sterile water for removing soil with loosely adhering bacteria and flash frozen for nucleic acid extraction. Afterwards, the plants were equally thinned to five plants per pot. Total fresh mass of tuber and leaves material, as well as the tuber diameter of each plant were measured at four weeks old plants. The leaves were separated from the roots, and oven dried at 60\u202f\u00b0C until constant weight, after which the dry weight of tubers and leaves were measured. The complete experiment was repeated twice.\n\n\nNucleic acid extraction and quantification of K. radicincitans in planta using qPCR\nDNA was extracted from approximately 50\u202fmg of lyophilised plant root material (one-week-old seedlings) using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The lysis of bacterial cells was ensured by the addition of 5\u202fmm sterile metal beads and by mechanical cell disruptor (Retsch MM200, Haan, Germany) at 30\u202frpm for 5\u202fmin. DNA quality and purity were assessed photometrically (NanoDrop, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was conducted using Advanced TM Universal SYBR\u00ae Green I Dye Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). K. radicincitans DSM 16656T species-specific primers and the plant TEF reference gene were used for in planta bacterial quantification [43]. The fold colonisation of K. radicincitans treated plants with respect to the reference gene and the control plants was calculated and represented with the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394cq method [44].\n\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analysed using SPSS Statistics v.2 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data are presented as mean values\u202f\u00b1\u202fstandard deviations (SD) or standard error (SE). The means were tested for significant differences by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post hoc test. Repeated measures ANOVA was carried out for the phosphate solubilisation data. The level of significance was set at P\u202f<\u202f0.05.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nEffects of osmotic stress on phosphate solubilisation capability\nTo look into the influence of osmotic unbalance on phosphate solubilisation capability PVK-amended liquid media with NaCl was used. Fig. 1\nA shows the positive effects on K. radicincitans ability to solubilise calcium phosphate in the PVK media under osmotic stress caused by 4% NaCl, compared with that in the PVK control media (NaCl 0.02%), solubilisation in the salt-amended media increased by up to 23.3%. The bacterial uptake of hydroxyectoine was detected by HPLC analysis after 15\u202fh in response to high salinity, reaching more than 500\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fg\u22121 of dry biomass at 24\u202fh. No hydroxyectoine was detected in cells grown in PVK in the absence of salt. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant differences (F2, 9\u202f=\u202f28.229; P\u202f<\u202f0.001) in response to the accumulation of hydroxyectoine on phosphate solubilisation capability during cultivation in PVK medium at 4% NaCl, and additional phosphate release increased by up to 9.39% after five days (Fig. 1A). Thus, K. radicincitans can solubilise phosphate in a range of 150\u2013400\u202fmg\u202fL-1 after four days of cultivation. Online pH monitoring by the BioLector during the cultivation in PVK media, demonstrated a decrease in pH, with minimal pH values of 5.43, 5.66 and 5.82 recorded after 12.3\u202fh, 21.6\u202fh and 22.3\u202fh for PVK control, PVK 4% NaCl with hydroxyectoine and PVK 4% NaCl media respectively. (Fig. 1B).\n\n\nPhosphatase enzyme activity\nCompared to the PVK control and the PVK 4% NaCl media, the addition of hydroxyectoine induced a positive effect on phosphatase enzyme activity. Acid phosphatase activity was highly induced by the presence of hydroxyectoine in the PVK media (4% NaCl) after 24\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f12.00; P\u202f=\u202f0.0029), 48\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f70.67; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and 120\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f35.22; P\u202f=\u202f0.0001) (Fig. 2\nA). Conversely, alkaline phosphatase activity was affected only after 24\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f35.52; P\u202f=\u202f0.0001), since at 48\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f1.17; P\u202f=\u202f0.3542) and at 120\u202fh (F2, 11\u202f=\u202f1.32; P\u202f=\u202f0.3140), all treatments presented similar activities (Fig. 2B). Chemical control hydroxyectoine had not a detectable reaction for inducing P-solubilising.\n\n\nPlant growth promotion in radish\nGenerally, plant growth promotion by non-osmoadapted and osmoadapted K. radicincitans cells was observed in all inoculated radish plants. Interestingly, when hydroxyectoine at 1\u202fmM was added during the cultivation of bacterial cells before plant seed inoculation, the fresh matter of tuber and leaves increased significantly by 41.1% (F3, 39\u202f=\u202f9.80, P\u202f=\u202f0.0001) and 5.4% (F3, 39\u202f=\u202f3.86, P\u202f=\u202f0.0172) in comparison to the non-inoculated control (Fig. 3\nA). Notably, compared with the osmoadapted cells in DM 4% NaCl, the hydroxyectoine amended cells increased the dry matter of either tubers or leaves by 16.20% (F3, 39\u202f=\u202f3.01, P\u202f=\u202f0.0426) and 3.96% (F3, 39\u202f=\u202f3.60, P\u202f=\u202f0.0672) respectively (Fig. 3B). In line with the plant weight increase, the tuber diameter also significantly increased in all cases of K. radicincitans cells compared to the non-inoculated control (F3, 34\u202f=\u202f6.70, P\u202f=\u202f0.0013). The tuber diameter varied from 15.74\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.82\u202fmm in the native control up to 19.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.41\u202fmm for the hydroxyectoine pre-conditioned treatment (Fig. 3C).\n\n\n\nK. radicincitans plant colonisation\nRegarding the relative gene expression response, compared with non-pre-conditioned bacteria cells at 1% NaCl, bacteria cells pre-conditioned with 4% NaCl colonised significantly tissue of eight-day-old seedlings (F2, 14\u202f=\u202f10.803; P\u202f=\u202f0.033), in comparison to non-pre-conditioned cells at 1% NaCl (Fig. 4\n). Consistent with the biomass production of radish plants, the endophytic colonisation was relatively strong in the presence of intracellular hydroxyectoine in K. radicincitans cells that were osmoadapted at 4% NaCl; the colonisation was approximately 3-fold greater under the evaluated treatment conditions (F2, 14\u202f=\u202f10.803; P\u202f=\u202f0.002) (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nBeyond the undeniable plant growth-promoting capability of K. radicincitans, results of this study suggest that it is feasible to significantly improve plant colonisation ability of bacterial endophytes, by physiologically growing them under conditions that promote the uptake or synthesis of advantageous compatible solutes such as hydroxyectoine. The bacterial ability to solubilise rock phosphate has been extensively reported as a vital mechanism that promotes plant growth [45,46]. In this study, was demonstrated that K. radicincitans cells under osmotic stress could increase its phosphate solubilisation capability up to 357.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.38\u202fmg\u202fL-1 in comparison to non-stressed cells with 290.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f42.6\u202fmg\u202fL-1 after four days of cultivation. Comparable yields are congruent with other pure culture experiments with Gram-negative bacterial endophytes [47]. Therefore, bacteria may respond to high salinity no only by accumulating exogenous osmolytes such as hydroxyectoine but also by up-regulating central metabolic pathways involved in the organic acid synthesis, which is well known for its role as crucial factors in phosphate solubilisation [48]. Since the pH values were lower in the treatment with hydroxyectoine compared to the treatment in which the bacterial cells were grown solely in PVK 4% NaCl media, a higher concentration of organic acids or the consumption of alkaline components within the media is feasible in conjunction with the osmoadaptation process [33].\nWidely distributed in microorganisms, plants and animals, phosphatases are hydrolases that catalyse the hydrolysis of orthophosphate monoesters thereby releasing phosphate [49]. The general classification of acid and alkaline phosphatases relies only on the optimum pH for enzymatic activity. A major production of enzymes may be correlated with the intracellular content of amino acids, since phosphatases are built on the basis of amino acid sequences and the phosphoryl group acceptors. It is expected that the physiological changes caused by either osmoadaptation or the addition of hydroxyectoine trigger metabolic pathways for induction of amino acids, either aromatic or branched-chain ones, which can favour enzyme biosynthesis and secretion. At high salinity, as a homeostasis response, trehalose biosynthesis in K. radicincitans cells may also lead to high concentrations of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP), which catalyses the hydrolysis of trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) to not only trehalose but also inorganic phosphate [50,51]. A greater production of enzymes, including phosphatases, may also be attributed to the construction of osmo-remedial mutations-epimutations in K. radicincitans cells, since some proteins are nonfunctional when the cells are grown in media of low osmotic strength but regain activity at elevated osmolarities, suggesting that cells may be undergoing phenotypic modulation [52,53]. Here the increase in acid phosphatase activity of the endophyte K. radicincitans exposed to osmotic shock in the presence of hydroxyectoine was evident. However, further research is needed to elucidate the types of phosphatases (nonspecific vs specific for certain substrates) that have been up-regulated in the production process.\nSince osmoadaptation in this bacterium leads to increased acid phosphatase enzyme production, it can be expected that this sub-lethal pre-conditioning procedure also supports the metabolite-rich arsenal to face the extremely competitive rhizosphere conditions before entering the plant. It has been demonstrated with bacteria such as Pantoea agglomerans, that osmotic stress can alter quorum sensing or the quenching of produced metabolites such as 1,3-propanediol, which are suggested to act as signals in the plant microbiome, resulting in tolerance to abiotic stress [54,55]. Therefore, K. radicincitans has a fraction of genes involved in propanediol degradation (PDD-pduABDEFLMPQ) and dha genes (dhaBDKLMT) involved in glycerol transformation (GT) [56].\n\nK. radicincitans cells were able to promote growth in radish plants. These findings are in line with previous studies [29], in which the weight of radish tubers and leaves increased from 20 to roughly 50%, in response to either seed-inoculated or two-leaf sprayed plants with fresh cultivated cells. However, since in these pot experiments the majority of plant growth yields were not significantly different between K. radicincitans cells grown in DM 1% and DM 4% NaCl, the physiological advantages conferred to the osmoadapted cells may affect mainly during early colonisation stages, as shown here for one-week old plants. Thus, the relative high endophytic lifestyle preference for salt-stressed bacteria cells and hydroxyectoine-added cells may be due to the alteration of signalling types of metabolites that K. radicincitans can secrete into the microenvironments surrounding plant roots, modifying plant-defence and plant-competition mechanisms along with plant metabolite synthesis [57]. Besides, external stimuli such as the presence of root exudates may up-regulate the expression of the chemotaxis and motility-related genes of these bacteria [56].\nConsistent with the biomass production of radish plants, plant colonisation was stronger in the presence of intracellular hydroxyectoine within K. radicincitans cells, in which the approximately 3-fold increase in colonisation was significant under the evaluated conditions. Generally, these results may indicate that symbiotic performance with plants increased by synergistic effects of pre-conditioned cells by osmoadaptation and the physiological changes caused by hydroxyectoine. However, despite the endophytic colonisation ability of the strain, it also growth and colonises the root surfaces [58,59]. These cells may contribute to phosphorous solubilization and improved plant P-uptake which has been previously demonstrated [33]. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to determine the performance of halotolerant bacterial endophytic cells on plant phosphorous uptake under saline conditions.\nThe reinforcement of in vitro phosphate solubilisation capability, including the production of acid phosphatase enzymes and the accumulation of hydroxyectoine, also suggests an intracellular metabolic re-ordering within bacterial cells in response to high salinity. It is proposed that these substantial and significant alterations in metabolites levels represent the activation of a phenotypic shift as an osmoadaptation mechanism for conferring both survivals under such stress conditions and advantages during rhizosphere competition establishment, orchestrating nutrient exchange and mediating associations within the plant. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to address the pre-conditioning of bacterial endophytic cells as an alternative to increasing plant colonisation abilities.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this study showed that physiological modifications of K. radicincitans by osmotic stress treatments and by the accumulation of compatible solutes during cultivation constitute a feasible strategy to improve the ability of the bacterium to solubilise phosphate and to promote the root colonisation. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed for understanding the related mechanisms that are triggered by osmoadaptation and compatible solutes inclusions that favour endophyte-plant signalling. Moreover, pre-conditioning could be a promising alternative prior to formulating bacterial endophytes.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1695":"\n\nIntroduction to MALDI-TOF MS-based microbial characterisation\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is an advanced tool for the fast and high-resolution characterization of microorganisms [1]. The method is based on measurement of the molecular mass of ions generated from the most abundant proteins of a sample culture and uses the mass spectral information as a fingerprint for a particular organism (exemplified in Fig. 1\n). A typical workflow containing MALDI-TOF MS starts with the isolation of microorganisms from a chosen sample and their cultivation on nutrient medium to obtain a pure axenic culture [2\u20134]. Microbial cultures in their exponential phase are grown under standardized conditions and then subjected to sample processing in two different ways: a direct method or a solvent extraction method. The first is a fast technique where a smear of microbial cells is applied directly to the MALDI target plate. This approach usually leads to low-quality spectra due to overloading or the presence of compounds disturbing the ionization process, but can be recommended for routine assessments. For acquisition of high-quality spectra, cell walls are lysed in a suitable way, and proteins are extracted with (usually) formic acid using the solvent extraction method (Fig. 2\n). The samples spotted onto the MALDI target plate are then overlaid with matrix, and spectra are acquired from intact proteins in the range of m\/z 2000 \u2013 20,000 [5]. These spectra are then matched to a reference library to determine the identity of the microorganism. There are several vendors on the market providing instrumental and software solutions as well as commercial spectral libraries for MALDI-TOF MS-based biotyping [6]. As an example, the Bruker MALDI Biotyper library contains spectra of 7014 bacterial and 1300 filamentous fungi isolates (as on February 1st, 2019).\nThe popularity of MALDI-TOF MS for microbial biotyping is based on its speed, simplicity and cost efficiency. Due to these advances, MALDI-TOF MS diagnosis has been successfully adapted to clinical microbiology in the past 20\u202fyears to accelerate patient diagnosis and therapy [7] and plays a vital role in the characterisation of human gut microbiota [8]. Constant enhancements in instrumental platforms, sample processing methods and extent of spectral libraries accelerated the establishment of MS-based diagnosis in clinical laboratories and readers are referred to comprehensive reviews regarding its clinical application [1,9]. In some cases, acquired MALDI-TOF spectra are used to create dendrograms and establish pseudo-phylogenetic groupings based on the similarity of mass spectra. However, because MS spectra, having a limited number of peaks, lack the evolutionary relatedness of small-subunit rRNA sequences or other genomic information, a determination of relatedness of unknown isolates is difficult but can be facilitated by combined analysis of additional biomarkers [10,11].\nThe method is applicable for a wide range of microbial isolates, including those of bacteria [12\u201314], fungi [15] and archaea [16], and extends to many other cultivable organisms, such as microalgae [17], protozoa [18] or viruses [19]. Although MALDI-TOF MS is successfully applied in the identification of clinical isolates [2,20], characterization of isolates from plant-associated samples is hampered by a lack of reference spectra in available databases. Nevertheless, MALDI-TOF MS as a powerful tool for the rapid grouping of bacterial isolates, i.e., dereplication, in large-scale screening campaigns. In this review, the applicability of this method as a high-resolution tool for studying microbial diversity is discussed.\n\n\nMS-based exploration of plant-associated microbial communities\nWith an increased understanding of the diversity of plant-bacterial associations, future biotechnological applications for stable crop production, conservation of biodiversity and sustainable agro-ecosystems are foreseeable. Hence, there is a high demand for high-throughput methods for the classification and characterization of cultivable microorganisms isolated from soils, rhizospheres or plants grown under diverse environmental conditions. There is a growing awareness of the complex interplay between plants, soil and their microbial communities, and current research efforts aim at understanding how microbiota present in rhizospheres and endospheres of crops account for plant health and productivity [21\u201323]. Up to the present, microbial communities were described often by shotgun sequencing approaches, which left their functionalities and activities aside. More recently, in order to close this gap, microbes have been isolated from their respective environments in extensive culture experiments and assessed for their physiological properties [24]. Novel nutrient media are developed to allow the isolation of niche microorganisms [25,26]. A long-term goal is to manage and engineer soil microorganisms by agricultural practice, to select proper plant genotypes or to apply microbial inoculants with a distinct function, such as biocontrol, growth promotion or abiotic stress alleviation [27].\nA common strategy in studying cultivable microorganisms is plating the chosen disrupted tissue or sample on culture medium and assessing the growth of developing colonies. Then, morphologically different colonies are selected for further analysis such as 16S rRNA sequencing or biochemical testing [28,29\u201332]. This approach usually leads to a bias in assessing the diversity of a habitat since morphological similar species, that may have different metabolic capabilities, are excluded from downstream investigations. Another way of conducting such ecological experiments is to process all isolated microbes for nucleotide analysis without preselection, which results in a considerable sample load and high expense [33\u201335]. The application of MALDI-TOF MS for fast and inexpensive dereplication of recurrent isolated microorganisms would be of particular advantage in large microbial community studies since the grouping of large sets of isolates according to their intact protein profiles can be performed without knowledge on their taxonomic identification.\nPrevious studies demonstrated the applicability of MALDI-TOF MS for high-throughput dereplication and its applicability for unbiased studies of the cultivable microbial community [36\u201339]. The discrimination power of MALDI-TOF MS by combining MS data from both intact proteins and specialized metabolites was recently demonstrated and allowed the characterisation of isolates based on their identity and potential environmental function [10]. In the following, an overview of the bioinformatic background of the dereplication principle is provided.\n\n\nBioinformatic means for dereplication of microbial isolates\nIdentification of plant-associated isolates is less successful as compared to clinical microorganisms due to an underrepresentation of environmental reference strains in commercial mass spectral databases [40,41]. Two main bioinformatic strategies are commonly used to improve dereplication when using whole-cell or simple acidic protein extracts for MALDI-TOF MS. The first strategy is to expand the commercial databases by including additional plant-associated reference strains. This approach has the advantage of still profiting from the simplicity of sample preparation and rapidness in measurement and identification of the MALDI biotyping as no additional statistical analysis is required, but achieves better identification rates [16,42]. Most platforms have options for researchers to customize the mass spectral libraries with user-selected reference strains and provide training or protocols to create a personalized database. Suitable reference strains can be (1) cultivated environmental samples that have not been identified, (2) purchased, cultivated and measured known reference strains and (3) strains whose mass spectra have been received from other institutes. While some attempts were made to create open-access repositories, they are still very limited in scope [15]. Often, commercial libraries allow only genus-level identification for plant-associated samples. The accuracy of identification can generally be improved by including in-house reference spectra, as they are measured with the same techniques, technicians and machines. In the context of expanding a spectral library, it is crucial to realize that confident species or strain identification can be achieved only when several reference strains of one species are available in the database. Usually, only one strain per species, with the exception of the most common clinical bacteria, is present in the commercial databases. To improve identification, it is advised by commercial library vendors that three to six strains for one species that take into account biological variations should be included for common environmental microorganisms. However, these library expansions need continuous work, and their maintenance can be time consuming.\nIn large cohort microbial studies, identifying the number of unique species or strains can also be achieved without identifying a microorganism. For the dereplication step, grouping isolates from the same taxon rapidly to determine and reduce the number of isolates for further analysis is sufficient [36]. Therefore, the second strategy involves using statistical analysis to group mass spectra. A first step can be to use available opportunities for visualisation provided by commercial software to create for instance dendrograms or composite correlation matrices [43] to determine similar isolates from all the isolates of one study (Fig. 3\n). These methods are performed by clustering the obtained peak mass lists or the whole mass spectra of different isolates. However, it can be difficult to visually decide whether individual clusters in a dendrogram represent isolates from the same species or what level of correlation between mass spectra represents isolates from the same species. Using additional statistical analysis steps or software with further options can therefore improve the approach in creating a nonredundant set of isolates. Several studies have successfully implemented MALDI-TOF MS-based biotyping to classify mass spectra for dereplication [36\u201339,44]. Generally, highly similar clusters were used to identify identical isolates and select representatives of these clusters for further validation, e.g., via partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, ITS region sequencing or repetitive element-based PCR. The evaluation of appropriate cut-off values for cluster delineation was based on threshold values established by the additional validation steps and\/or a minimum number of mass peaks shared between isolates. It was shown that a similarity-based MALDI-TOF MS approach can be used for dereplication without additional, costly DNA-based methods [38]. New approaches also include machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest models to automate the identification of isolates in environmental studies [45,46].\n\n\nCurrent issues and implications for using MS-based biotyping\nThe quality of mass spectra is important for successful MALDI-TOF MS-based analysis of microorganisms. For example, that identification can be improved in various ways other than adding missing or rare species to the database or optimizing pre-analytical settings (e.g., sample preparation, growth conditions, and matrix use [5,47\u201349]). A quality check of the acquired mass spectra and of the pre-set parameters for automated data acquisition is essential, especially when using automated measuring tools. Including low-quality spectra can lead to false positive identification or no identification. Common problems include suppressed peaks, low peak intensities, and matrix background signals. Quality checks need to be included, especially when reference mass spectra for libraries are created. It was suggested that a good spectrum should have a minimum of 70 peaks for bacteria and 30\u201340 peaks for fungi and an average peak intensity of 103 arbitrary units or higher [41]. To reduce variations caused by technicians and instruments, samples should be spotted in triplicate, and each spot should be analysed at least three times. In a comparison of manual and automatic mass spectrum measurements, it was found that while automatic measurement tended to increase the base peak resolution, other measures of spectrum quality such as signal-to-noise ratio, data richness and reproducibility were reduced [50]. Looking at the same issue of the low reproducibility of automated spectrum acquisition, another study reported optimized user threshold values of several parameters (peak selection mass range, signal-to-noise ratio, threshold peak intensity, threshold minimum resolution, and number of shots summed) and improved reproducibility [51].\nA further aspect to consider is that MALDI-TOF MS requires a monoculture to perform identification. However, morphologically similar samples do not need to contain the same species. In environmental dereplication studies, a re-cultivating step from a single colony to control for a pure culture may not be performed. Therefore, some unidentified spectra may be bacterial mixtures that can be hard to identify with algorithms developed to identify single microorganisms. The resulting mass spectra often have signals with suppressed intensity. However, the main abundant peaks of all the species should be present but at much lower intensity than peaks from samples from pure cultures. Further statistical analysis could be used to identify these spectra as well. The large variation in peaks and intensities occurring with mixtures is an issue. Only a few studies have attempted to address this challenge by applying different biomarker identification strategies [52\u201354]. However, this methodology is yet to be standardized and mixtures of microorganisms are more frequently analysed via tandem MS strategies [55].\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nMALDI-TOF MS is the method of choice for the grouping of plant-associated microbial isolates due to its fast, simple and cost-effective measurement of a large number of samples. Recent developments in automation of colony picking and deposition on the MALDI target as well as matrix deposition should further decrease consumable costs and preparation time [56]. An increased use of MALDI-TOF MS in large-scale screening campaigns to collect microorganisms from rhizospheres or plants is going to lead to the detection of novel species that could bear a potential use to sustainably increase crop production [57]. Future improvements in dereplication, either by expanding commercial mass spectral libraries and\/or by implementing an additional data analysis step to group mass spectra, are expected to further exploit the capacity of MALDI-TOF MS in microbial studies.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n","1696":"\n\nIntroduction\nMost microbiome projects today apply large-scale parallel sequencing to taxonomically and functionally characterize previously described and not-yet-cultivated, uncharacterized microorganisms. The widespread application of high-throughput genomic approaches has been afforded by next-generation sequencing platforms that are easy to install and maintain. In addition, widely established experimental and bioinformatic protocols exist for sample processing, nucleic acid isolation, sequence target amplification, library preparation, sequence data processing and statistical analysis. Other high-throughput methods for system-wide microbiome analyses, such as metaproteomics or metabolomics\/metabonomics [1], are less well established and widely used but are often successfully combined with genomics for systems-level approaches to simultaneously study different aspects of the microbiome. Cultivation-based isolation and characterization of individual microorganisms from microbiome samples can further complement nucleic acid sequencing-based and other 'omic approaches [2]. In the following, the microbiota will be referred to as the 'assemblage of microorganisms present in a defined environment' and the microbiome as the 'entire habitat, including the microorganisms \u2026 , their genomes \u2026 , and the surrounding environmental conditions' [1]. As sequencing-based microbiome analysis continues to be the most popular technique across the field, this review focuses on the discussion of experimental and bioinformatic aspects of this approach to highlight current problems and pitfalls as well as future chances and possibilities (Fig. 1\n).\n\n\nGenomics and bioinformatics techniques of microbiome analysis\nSequencing-based characterizations of entire microbial communities, as well as their individual components and functions in unprecedented detail, is largely afforded by two main techniques: amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. The first method generates taxonomic compositional microbiota profiles at relatively moderate costs that allow even small research groups to run large-scale bacterial microbiota analysis projects. The latter method generally affords a more comprehensive, but also more costly, taxonomic and functional analysis of the entire viral, bacterial and eukaryotic microbiota [3]. Both approaches have been scaled up to include thousands of samples in a single study. Best practice recommendations for microbiome analysis, including laboratory and bioinformatic procedures are available, for example, from the U.S. Microbiome Quality Control [4] project.\n\nTaxonomic microbiome profiling by amplicon sequencing\nAmplicon sequencing methods rely on the selective binding of universal primer pairs to highly conserved regions within the genomes of specific microbiome members of interest and the sequencing of the resulting PCR products, which encompass taxon-specific hypervariable regions [5]. The most commonly used target amplicon for microbiome analysis is the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, but universal primer pairs have also been described for archaeal and eukaryotic small subunit ribosomal RNA genes, internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the fungal and other ribosomal RNA operons and other conserved genomic loci [6]. Within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene numerous primer combinations have been proposed to amplify different hypervariable regions and to generate PCR products of variable lengths suitable for different sequencing platforms (e.g., Pacific Biosciences vs. Illumina) [5]. However, even \u201cuniversal\u201d primers can preferentially bind specific bacterial taxa, leading to compositional study biases that vary between microbiome types (e.g. gut vs. vaginal microbiome) and should be considered in the project planning phase [7,8].\nSequence variations in 16S and 18S rRNA genes, ITS regions and other metagenomic loci contain phylogenetic information that can be used to infer the taxonomic relationships of their microbial hosts. However, natural genetic variations are not easily distinguishable from sequencing errors, which even on the relatively accurate Illumina sequencing platform affects \u223c0.1% of all sequenced nucleotides [9]. Given the scale of current microbiome studies, bioinformatic protocols therefore have to account for millions of wrong base calls per project.\nFor amplicon sequencing-based microbiota analysis, sequences are traditionally clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on arbitrarily defined thresholds of sequence similarity. For example, 16S rRNA gene fragments of >97% sequence identity are clustered into separate OTUs that reflect the phylogenetic boundaries of distinct bacterial species. Sequence clustering can be guided by bacterial reference genomes, yet common methods often also include de novo clustering to identify previously unknown species [10]. OTU picking assigns similar, but slightly different sequences to the same taxon, assuming a shared biological origin. Clustering therefore diminishes the impact of technical variation on the analysis results, but at the expense of reduced sensitivity in detecting biological variation. Fungal microbiota analysis by ITS amplicon sequencing follows similar principles as bacterial 16S rRNA analysis but sequence clustering and classification are complicated by inconsistent amplicon lengths and varying sequence similarities between fungal species [11]. The UNITE project represents an effort to generate a resource to represent the growing, known diversity of ITS sequence data [12], similar to the well-established SILVA database for pro- and eukaryotic small and large subunit rRNA genes [13].\nTo differentiate between biological and technical sequence variations, reference-free statistical denoising methods such as Deblur or Dada2 [14,15] have recently been implemented in QIIME2, a popular open-source software package for 16S rRNA analysis [16]. These tools generate error profiles of amplicon sequence datasets, which are then used to resolve sequencing errors and achieve single-nucleotide resolution for each amplicon sequence. Compared to OTU-based approaches, analysis of the resulting amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) provides improved sensitivity and specificity and reduces the problem of inflated microbiota datasets due to falsely identified distinct OTUs originating from mis-clustered sequences [17]. In addition, OTU clustering results are bound by the specific sequence data from which they were inferred and are therefore non-reproducible with modified or expanded datasets. The latest denoising algorithms overcome this limitation by recovering independent biological sequences as ASVs, fostering the reproducibility and comparability of amplicon-based microbiome analysis [18].\n\n\nTaxonomic and functional profiling of the entire microbiome by metagenomics\nMetagenomics uses the whole-genome shotgun approach to fragment and sequence the entire DNA of a microbiome sample instead of 16S rRNA gene fragments or other target amplicons alone. Correspondingly, the generated reads can originate from phages, viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi and other eukaryotes and include plasmids and other extra-chromosomal elements as well as host, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA. Compared to 16S rRNA analysis, this method needs significantly more data to obtain the sequencing depth that is required to identify and characterize rare microbiota members, often reaching several terabases per study and increasing costs and bioinformatic demands. However, as metagenomics potentially allows for functional microbiota characterization and, in theory, affords taxonomic resolution down to the level of individual microbial strains, it has become increasingly popular in microbiome research [19].\nQuality control measures for metagenomic shotgun sequencing with new tools, such as KneadData, combine quality-based metagenomic read trimming and filtering with the bioinformatic detection and removal of human, plant and other eukaryotic host DNA (http:\/\/huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu\/kneaddata). Metagenomic sequence data are typically analysed either by de novo assembly or by comparing reads individually to reference databases in a mapping-based process [20]. The de novo assembly of microbial genomes can help identify and comprehensively characterize previously unknown members of the microbiota [21]. However, because assembly requires substantial sequencing depth, assembly-based methods are typically restricted to the genomic reconstruction of highly abundant microbiome members. Marker gene-based sequence mapping with tools such as MetaPhlAn2 can be used for taxonomic profiling of entire microbial communities, including rare microbiome members [22].\n\n\n\nMicrobiome sample handling and processing\n\nMaintaining microbiome integrity during sample collection and storage\nAmong many other factors, the accuracy of sequencing-based microbiota analysis depends on how well the original structure of the microbial community can be preserved between the time of sample collection and processing. Distinct members of the human, plant and environmental microbiota respond differently to extended periods of sample storage by dying or by suspending, retaining or increasing metabolic activity. Problematic artefacts for taxonomic or functional microbiota analysis can also arise from unintended disruption of the sample environment due to freeze\u2013thaw cycles; exposure to oxygen, UV light, or osmotic stress; storage buffer components, etc. As a consequence, storage conditions can affect microbiome analysis and lead to biased results [23].\nSnap freezing of microbiome samples in liquid nitrogen and their long-term storage at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C are generally considered as the gold standard for sample preservation [24]. However, commercial nucleic acid-preserving reagents and sampling kits that are used to maintain sample integrity in studies involving the collection of environmental samples or self-collected human specimens outside of the laboratory environment have generally been reviewed favourably [23]. Studies have suggested that temperature shifts alone have minor effects on taxonomic compositions and inter-individual differences in human gut microbiota analyses [24]. Chu et al. (2017) found the living bacterial microbiota of faecal samples to be most strongly affected by oxygen exposure, rather than by other factors, even repeated freeze\u2013thaw cycles [25]. The same accounts for fungal microbiome samples, which are commonly stored with nucleic acid-preserving agents [26]. As mycorrhizal soil fungi colonize plant root tissues, the disruption of root connections after sampling can reduce mycorrhizal mycelial abundance and subsequently, induce the growth of mycelium-dependent other fungal opportunists, highlighting a specific protential problem for plant-associated fungal microbiota analysis [27].\n\n\nAvoiding selective enrichment and depletion of microbes during nucleic acid isolation\nObtaining personalized gut microbiome analysis results from consumer microbiome testing services, journalist Tina Saey was surprised to receive substantially different results, particularly with respect to the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial gut phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes\n[28]. While numerous confounding factors might account for these observed variations, differences between nucleic acid isolation protocols have been known to introduce biases in taxonomic microbiota analysis. Even widely used commercial kits for DNA and RNA isolation differ in their efficiency in lysing specific microbes, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, respectively [29,30]. Host-associated and environmental microbiome samples typically contain heterogeneous mixtures of viral, archaeal and eukaryotic microorganisms, including live and dead, active and inactive, vegetative and sporulated cells; cellular debris; free nucleic acids and other macromolecules. Microbial lysis protocols differ in their capacity to break open these different types of microbial components for nucleic acid isolation. Humic acids, melanin, polysaccharides, polyphenols and other sample components can interfere with DNA and RNA isolation and downstream applications, such as nucleic acid amplification or concentration determination [31].\nMost microbiome analysis protocols include combinations of physical and enzymatic disruptions of microbial cells for nucleic acid isolation [4], which can be amended based on project-specific requirements, e.g., by adding specific polysaccharide-degrading enzymes such as lyticase for fungal microbiome analysis projects [32]. However, protocol variations lead to study-specific biases, which is one reason for the scarcity of meta-analyses of microbiome data [33\u201335]; these meta-analyses have had trouble with, for example, the identification of universal, disease-specific biomarkers across separate human microbiome studies. Depending on the microbiome sample type and specific microbial taxa of interest, testing and evaluating different nucleic acid extraction protocols on mock communities of diverse, defined microbial composition should be part of the early project planning phase. But project-specific technical biases are difficult to completely avoid, and consistency of the applied methods within specific microbiome studies might be most useful and practical.\n\n\nReducing, assessing and characterizing microbiome contamination\nThe interpretation of microbiome data can be complicated by contamination from sources other than the original sample [36]. The high sensitivity of sequencing-based microbiome analysis, particularly 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, in detecting previously unknown, rare, and often non-cultivable microbiome members can also be problematic when contamination leads to false positive results. Laboratory consumables, reagents and even DNA extraction kits contain trace amounts of microbial DNA, and to some extent, sample collection, handling and processing always lead to low-level contamination [37,38]. Salter et al. (2014) ran microbiome analyses on serial dilutions of the same clonal culture of Salmonella bongori and identified a diverse microbiome that included both environmental and host-associated bacteria from the human skin and gut [37]. Importantly, the relative abundance of bacterial signals from contamination was positively correlated with the dilution factor of the original culture, demonstrating that the microbiome signal from contamination becomes more significant with decreasing amounts of sample starting material. Thus, contamination is less relevant for the analysis of faecal or soil samples of high microbial density than for host-associated human or plant microbiome studies of low microbial biomass, such as skin and vaginal swabs, tissue biopsies, urine, and the phyllosphere [39,40].\nA prominent example of a controversially discussed microbiome finding concerns the placenta [41]. While several prominent publications reported on the presence of a unique placental microbiome in clinically asymptomatic women [42,43], these reports have been challenged as contradicting the paradigm of a tightly immune-controlled sterile womb and the practice of surgically removing sterile mouse pups from pregnant mice to generate germ-free mice [41]. Lauder et al. (2016) compared human placenta samples with vaginal swabs and experimental controls, including sterile and 'air swabs', and found the bacterial density and taxonomic composition of the healthy placental samples to be indistinguishable from those of microbiome-negative controls [44].\nA three-tiered approach has been proposed to address the contamination problem [36]: First, good laboratory practice measures can reduce the chance of contamination when handling and preparing microbiome samples. This includes using purified, DNA-free reagents and kits, whenever possible, as well as spatially separating sample processing and DNA isolation, PCR setup and subsequent steps in the lab. Besides bacterial cells and genomic DNA from environmental sources, amplified PCR products can pose an important laboratory source of contamination for 16S rRNA analysis [37]. Second, the extent of contamination should be assessed by including technical replicates and internal controls in every step of the sample preparation protocol. Negative, microbiome-free, extraction controls and positive controls of microbial mock communities in defined concentrations can be used to determine the upper and lower limits of detection. Third, contamination controls should be sequenced and analysed together with the biological samples to characterize the influence of contamination on analysis results. For example, similarities between microbiome profiles of biological samples and negative controls can be quantified to compare the effect sizes of biological findings against contamination signals. However, the general exclusion of putative contamination signals from the analysis, by removing taxa from negative controls, can also distort microbiome analysis results and should be avoided. As contamination often originates from the laboratory environment, it can be directly influenced by related projects and include microbial signals that are similar to those from the original samples [37].\n\n\nReducing the impact of host DNA\nNon-microbial DNA from human, animal or plant hosts is another major concern for sequencing-based microbiome analysis. Inadequate removal of host DNA can significantly increase the cost of host-associated microbiome projects or even make them practically impossible if the sequencing effort to obtain sufficient coverage of the microbial metagenome becomes prohibitively large. Healthy human faeces typically contain <10% human DNA, but up to 90% of sequence reads from low-microbial biomass samples such as saliva, nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal swabs can be assigned to the human host [40]. While bacterial concentrations in urine increase during bladder infection, the concomitant increase in host DNA from epithelial cell damage can complicate microbiome analyses [Fricke, unpublished data]. As chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes from eukaryotic cells also carry 16S rRNA genes, host DNA can be problematic for 16S rRNA analysis, especially for food or plant microbiome projects [45]. Finally, host sequence removal may be mandatory before newly generated sequence data can be released in public databases to secure the privacy and confidentiality of human study participants, as required by most journals and funding agencies prior to publication, or to protect proprietary information from genetically modified or patented crops.\nThe relative level of host DNA can be reduced experimentally, either by removing host cells before DNA extraction or by selectively enriching microbial DNA after DNA extraction, or host DNA can be deleted bioinformatically by identifying and removing host reads from resulting sequence data, as described above. To remove host cells before DNA extraction, differential lysis can be used to selectively release and degrade host DNA before microbial (bacterial and fungal) DNA is isolated since mammalian cells are less robust than most microbial cells [46]. Density gradient centrifugation has also been used to separate host tissue from bacterial cells in plant samples [47]. However, microbiome samples, such as human faeces, also contain free microbial DNA from dead bacteria or cells that were disrupted during sample collection or storage, and certain microbes may be more susceptible to eukaryotic lysis regimens than others. Therefore, differential lysis protocols can reduce total yields of isolate nucleic acids [48] and bias subsequent compositional microbiota analyses towards specific taxa such as hard-to-lyse gram-positive bacteria [49]. Commercial solutions have become available to detect and remove vertebrate DNA by binding methylated CpG sequence motifs, which are abundant in eukaryotic but rare in microbial genomic DNA [50]. The latter method has been used to enrich bacterial and protist DNA for subsequent analysis of human and fish samples [50]. As an alternative approach to reduce the number of host-derived, non-bacterial PCR products, Lundberg et al. (2013) developed synthetic oligomers that bind as peptide nucleic acid (PNA) PCR clamps specifically to plant chloroplast and mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene sequences and block them from amplification [45]. In a similar approach, Agler et al. (2016) used specific nested primers, or \u201cblocking oligos\u201d, inside the 16S rRNA gene of unwanted plant organelle DNA, to avoid amplification of the full-length PCR product for subsequent analyses [51].\n\n\n\nNew perspectives: Quantitative analysis and identification of active microbes\n\nAdopting methods for quantitative microbiome profiling\nWithout accounting for potential differences in absolute microbial abundance between samples, the vast majority of microbiome projects today aim to characterize microbial communities based on compositional data [52]. These studies typically determine fractions of an unknown total number of microbial species, 16S rRNA gene copies, and other taxon-specific genes or functional gene categories. Unfortunately, compositional data tend to be misinterpreted as suggesting absolute shifts, reductions or increases in specific microbial taxa, gene functions or other microbiome parameters. Changes in absolute abundance of microbiome features can be biologically and clinically relevant, e.g. in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [53], but tend to be ignored in standard microbiota projects. Vandeputte et al. (2017) found the bacterial load of human faeces to vary between healthy people and in individuals over time and bacterial density correlated with faecal enterotype [54]. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that quantitative microbiota profiling can change clinical perspectives. In this case, compared to previous reports based on relative faecal microbiota profiling, different bacterial taxa could be identified as specific biomarkers for inflammatory bowel diseases [54].\nDifferent experimental approaches have been proposed to gather quantitative microbiome information, including cell counting by flow cytometry [54], quantitative or real-time PCR of the universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene [55] and normalization of bacterial relative abundances based on defined cell numbers that are spiked into the samples before nucleic acid isolation [56]. While the first approach is technically more demanding, commercial kits have become available to easily integrate quantitative analyses into microbiome project workflows. Importantly, sequencing depth, i.e., the number of reads assigned to each sample after 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, should not be used to infer quantitative information, as inconsistent read counts between samples are typically technical artefacts that do not reflect quantitative differences [54]. However, the sequencing depth per sample does affect the alpha- and beta-diversity parameters of the microbiota and should be controlled, e.g., by bioinformatically rarefying read counts to equal numbers prior to statistical analysis [57].\n\n\nDifferentiating between total and active microbes\nSequencing-based microbiome studies typically rely on DNA as sole evidence for the existence of a microbiota in a sample. However, DNA from dying cells or spores or cell-free DNA in a sample may be evidence for microbial contact, but it does not necessarily indicate microbial life and an active microbiota in the sample. For example, the existence of a blood microbiome remains controversial, despite PCR-based evidence for bacterial 16S rRNA genes in blood DNA extracts from non-septic individuals, as attempts to culture bacteria from the same samples have mostly been unsuccessful [58]. While bacterial adaptation to the harsh conditions of the stomach has been demonstrated, metabolically active microbes in the stomach are difficult to distinguish from ingested, inactive microbes from other, adjacent body sites or food using DNA-based microbiota surveys alone [59]. To address this problem, a number of experimental and bioinformatic approaches have recently been proposed to identify metabolically active microbes reflective of a thriving microbiota.\nPropidium monoazide (PMA) intercalates into double-stranded DNA, preventing it from being amplified by PCR and has been used by Chu et al. (2017) to remove free DNA from dead microbes prior to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing [25]. Several groups have shown that 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microbiota compositions differ between RNA and DNA fractions isolated from the same sample [59]. This has been used to differentiate between transcriptionally active bacteria, which are identified on the basis of RNA evidence, and all other bacteria, which are identified on the basis of DNA evidence. Moreover, if DNA- and RNA-based analyses are combined with quantitative microbiota profiling, the ratio of 16S rRNA transcript-to-gene copies can be used to quantify transcriptional activity and stratify bacterial taxa [59]. However, recent studies on soil bacteria also found 16S rRNA transcripts to remain stable for extended periods of time [60] and 16S rRNA gene and transcript compositions to be indistinguishable [61], suggesting that RNA-based methods to measure metabolic activity do not work equally well for all microbiome types. Importantly, experimental protocols need to support the simultaneous isolation of DNA and RNA from the same sample and extracted RNA should be carefully controlled for contamination with trace amounts of DNA, in order to avoid selectively enriching specific microbial taxa with separate lysis protocols or erroneously interpreting DNA-based signals as indicators of transcriptional activity, respectively [59].\nAn interesting approach to bioinformatically infer microbial growth rates from metagenome sequence data has been proposed by Korem et al. (2015) [62]. The authors demonstrated a positive correlation between bacterial growth and replication activity in vitro that is reflected by relatively increased concentrations of DNA from genomic regions around the origin compared to that from the terminus of replication. By mapping metagenomic sequence reads to bacterial reference genomes, a 'peak-to-trough' coverage ratio was calculated by comparing the origin and terminus DNA concentrations for each individual genome. This ratio was then used to stratify gut bacteria according to replicational activity and to statistically associate specific active bacteria with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and type II diabetes [62].\n\n\n\nRelease of published microbiome data and protocols\nMicrobiome research benefits from the availability of research data and protocols, and efforts should be made to establish and maintain open data and protocol policies across the entire field of microbiome research [63]. Progress in human microbiome research is increasingly driven by large, multi-centre studies based on the processing, sequencing and analysis of thousands of samples, often using custom laboratory and bioinformatic protocols to generate a statistical basis to detect subtle microbiome phenotypes. As a consequence, newly generated raw data and metadata, tools and protocols represent a substantial scientific resource to the broader research community that allows others to reproduce and expand published findings, recombine datasets for meta-analyses and develop new analytical approaches. For this reason, raw sequence and other omics data, associated sample metadata, and experimental and bioinformatic protocols for sample processing and analysis from published studies need to be made fully, freely and easily accessible. Accurate, detailed and complete bioinformatics analysis protocols should all scripts and precise commands that are needed to allow for full reproduction of raw data processing, data analysis and the generation of published figures. Although most funding agencies and journals in theory have set formal policies for data availability, access can be complicated in practice due to incomplete or inconsistent datasets, missing metadata information, and simple technical difficulties. Authors can be reluctant to comply with formal requirements that journals and funding agencies are struggling to enforce. Universal mandatory data and protocol release before manuscript submission would facilitate and improve peer review and allow journals to check for data availability as part of the submission process.\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nMicrobiome research continues to excite both the scientific community and the public at large. However, the field has also been blamed for overselling findings and not producing reliable, applicable results [64]. While the mechanistic understanding of microbiota functions may yet remain too fragmentary to allow for the immediate development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications, there is little doubt about the general importance of human, animal and plant microbiomes for their hosts. To foster successful microbiome research in the future, it will be important for researchers, authors, reviewers, journals and funding agencies to (i) push the field towards the more widespread application of carefully controlled protocols for sample storage, nucleic acid isolation, contamination, amplification, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis; (ii) develop, optimize and standardize appropriate, improved analysis protocols; (iii) adopt and combine new experimental techniques, such as DNA- and RNA-based, relative and quantitative microbiota profiling; and (iv) increase the transparency and outreach of microbiome research by releasing data, metadata and protocols from published studies (Fig. 1).\n\n","1697":"\n\nIntroduction\nSoybean (Glycine max) is a major crop worldwide, with over 300 million tonnes produced globally. In contrast to cereals such as corn (maize; Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), soybean produces seeds containing many proteins and lipids, which make soybean particularly nutritious. In Japan, soybean is used as a raw material for tofu, natto, soy sauce, and miso, but elsewhere the seed is used mainly for oil and cattle feed. Soybean also contains various plant specialized (secondary) metabolites, such as isoflavones and saponins, as functional ingredients [1,2]. Because soybean plants establish symbiotic relationships with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the crop does not require much fertilizer to produce seeds. In reality, however, a large amount of fertilizers is supplied to soybean fields to maximize yield. Intensive use of fertilizers can lead to environmental problems such as eutrophication of rivers and lakes and global warming. Sustainable agricultural production requires that both yield and environmental issues be considered. Thence, the recruitment of rhizosphere microbes is necessary for sustainable soybean production.\nThe rhizosphere is defined as \u201cthe zone of soil surrounding the root which is affected by it\u201d [3,4]. Roots exert both physical influences, such as by root structure or heat generation, and chemical influences, such as by the secretion of a wide variety of plant-derived metabolites. Plant roots secrete metabolites into the rhizosphere actively using the energy from ATP and passively through diffusion [5,6]. Metabolites are also released into the rhizosphere as root tissues such as border cells become detached from the main root body [7].\nPlants secrete both low-molecular-weight compounds, such as amino acids, sugars, phenolics, terpenoids, and lipids, and high-molecular-weight compounds, including proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids, depending on the growth stage and environmental conditions [6]. Upon secretion into the rhizosphere, most metabolites are rapidly degraded by soil microbes, but some, especially specialized metabolites, remain in the soil and mediate biological communication [8,9]. The distribution of these metabolites in the rhizosphere varies depending on their chemical properties, with a relatively long-distance distribution of volatile compounds such as sesquiterpenes [10].\nMetabolites secreted by soybean roots that function in biological communication in the rhizosphere are shown in Fig. 1\n. Isoflavones and strigolactones are signal molecules for symbioses with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, respectively [5]. Glyceollin is biosynthesized as a disease-responsive phytoalexin. Glycinoeclepin A, which promotes hatching of soybean cyst nematodes [11], has potential functions in communication.\nThe communities and functions of rhizosphere microbes are distinct from those in bulk soils. Microbial diversity is reduced nearer to roots, with further reduction in the endosphere [12\u201315]. Accumulating evidence suggests that plants affect minerals and microbes in the rhizosphere [16\u201319]. The enhancement of the destabilization, solubilization, and accessibility of minerals in the rhizosphere by plants is summarized elsewhere [20,21]. This review focuses on the metabolites and microbes of the rhizosphere of soybeans grown in hydroponic culture and in fields. The characteristics of the soybean rhizosphere in relation to sustainable agriculture are also discussed.\nThe keywords used in the search strategy, include rhizosphere, microbiome, metagenome, soil microbe, root exudate, secondary metabolite, specialized metabolite, and soybean field. The extracted information was collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.\n\n\nMetabolites\nPlants produce a wide variety of low-molecular-weight compounds. These metabolites include a diverse range of bioactive compounds used in defence against both biotic and abiotic stresses and as attractants or repellents of other organisms. From an evolutionary perspective, most of these compounds are produced by certain species within a plant lineage and are called specialized metabolites. Researchers have estimated that more than 200,000 specialized metabolites are produced by plants [22,23]. During their evolution, plants acquire the ability to synthesize new metabolites, which confer adaptive advantages in ecosystems [24].\nTwo classes of specialized metabolites dominate the root exudates of soybean [25,26], namely, isoflavones and saponins. As dietary components, soybean isoflavones have important functions in reducing the risk of breast and prostate cancers [27], promoting bone health [28], relieving menopausal symptoms [29], and preventing coronary heart disease [30]. Soybean saponins also have bioactive functions [2], such as anti-inflammatory effects [31], free-radical scavenging activity [32], anti-allergic activity [33], and immune modulatory activities [34]. This section focuses on isoflavones and saponins, but the recent findings on the secretion of other metabolites and their potential functions in the rhizosphere are also summarized.\n\nIsoflavones\nIsoflavones are a subgroup of flavonoids found predominantly in legume plants [35]. These flavonoids are produced via isoflavone synthase. Isoflavones are well known for their function in plant\u2013microbe interactions, particularly in symbiosis and defence. In symbiosis, soybean roots secrete isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein into the rhizosphere as signal compounds for rhizobia to establish nodulation [36]. In defence, daidzein serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of glyceollins and phytoalexins that have antimicrobial and\/or anti-herbivore activities, and are induced upon infection by pathogens such as Phytophthora sojae and Macrophomina phaseolina\n[37]. Rhizosphere isoflavones also play various roles in biological communication with soil microbes [38,39]. Researchers have proposed two pathways for the secretion of isoflavones in soybean: (1) ATP-dependent active transport of isoflavone aglycones [40], and (2) secretion of isoflavone glucosides (possibly stored in vacuoles) into the apoplast, followed by the hydrolysis of glucosides with isoflavone conjugate-hydrolysing beta-glucosidase (ICHG) [41] (Fig. 2\n).\nIn hydroponic culture, daidzein was the predominant isoflavone in soybean root exudates throughout growth, with greater secretion during vegetative stages than during reproductive stages [25]. During reproductive stages, the secretion of malonylglucosides and glucosides increased to levels similar to those of aglycones. Under nitrogen deficiency, when nodule symbiosis occurred, the secretion of daidzein and genistein into the rhizosphere increased approximately 10-fold [25].\nIn field culture, both daidzein and genistein were found in the rhizosphere soil; the daidzein content was higher than that of genistein, as was the ratio of daidzein to genistein in the roots [42]. The isoflavone contents in rhizosphere soils were more than 100 times those in bulk soils at both the vegetative and reproductive stages. The degradation rate constant for daidzein in the soil was calculated to be 9.15\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202f(d\u22121), which corresponded to a half-life of 7.5\u202fdays [42]. The degradation rates for malonyldaidzein and daidzin were 8.511 (d\u22121) and 11.62 (d\u22121), respectively, both of which corresponded to a half-life of less than 2\u202fh [42]. From the degradation kinetics and the amount of isoflavones secreted in hydroponic culture during all growth stages, the rhizosphere daidzein concentration in the field was estimated to be maintained during the growth stages of soybean [42].\n\n\nSaponins\nSaponins occur widely throughout the plant kingdom and have various functions [43,44]. The typical structure of saponins is a combination of a hydrophobic aglycone to various functional groups and hydrophilic sugar moieties, which results in surface-active amphipathic compounds. Saponins appear to have physiological functions in defence against pathogens, pests, and herbivores [44].\nLegumes commonly synthesize triterpenoid saponins called soyasaponins, which are composed of aglycones, soyasapogenols, and oligosaccharides. Soyasaponins are classified into four groups depending on the aglycone structure: glycosides of soyasapogenol A (Group A), glycosides of soyasapogenol B (Group B), glycosides of soyasapogenol E (Group E), and glycosides of soyasapogenol B, the C22 of which is bound to 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one (DDMP) residues [2] (Fig. 3\n). Saponins may play roles in allelopathy in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) [45\u201347]. However, the secretion of saponins into the rhizosphere and their functions in biological communication remain largely unknown, except for the recent identification of soyasaponins in root exudates of legume species [26].\nIn hydroponic culture, the amount of soyasaponins secreted into the rhizosphere per plant peaked at the V3 growth stage (3\u202fweeks of age) and decreased in reproductive stages. The composition of soyasaponins in hydroponic culture medium varied with growth stage, with predominant secretion of Group A soyasaponins at stages V3 and V7 (5\u202fweeks of age) and higher secretion of Group B soyasaponins at reproductive stages. At the VE stage (1\u202fweek of age), when soyasaponin secretion was the highest per amount of root tissue (dry weight), the soyasaponin composition differed from that of other growth stages, with greater secretion of deacetyl soyasaponin Af, soyasaponin Ab, and soyasaponin Bb [26]. DDMP saponins were detected only in trace amounts throughout the growth stages, although they are a major class of soyasaponin in root tissues [26]. These results suggest mechanisms that regulate soyasaponins secretion. The amounts and functions of saponins in the soybean rhizosphere are currently under investigation.\n\n\nOther metabolites\nBesides isoflavones and saponins, soybean roots secrete a diverse range of metabolites, but the function of most of these metabolites in the rhizosphere has not been thoroughly analyzed. Capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry of soybean root exudates identified 79 metabolites belonging to organic and amino acids such as adipic acid, gluconic acid, glutaric acid, glyceric acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-asparagine, and L-serine [48]. Divergent responses of these metabolites were found during development and under phosphorus deficiency [48]. Highly variable forms of sugars, including glucose, pinitol, arabinose, galactose, sucrose, kojibiose, and oligosaccharides, were detected in soybean root exudates; these sugars are a potential carbon source for rhizosphere microbes [49]. Osmolytes such as proline and pinitol were found in soybean root exudates under drought stress [50].\nGlyceollins are phytoalexins synthesized in response to pathogens such as Phytophthora megasperma and herbicides [51]. More than 50% of glyceollins synthesized in soybean roots are secreted into hydroponic solution [52], but their fate and function in the rhizosphere remain to be characterized. Glycinoeclepin A and related compounds from a root extract of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) stimulate hatching of soybean cyst nematodes [11,53]; however, the synthesis of these compounds in soybean and their identification in the soybean rhizosphere have not been reported. The bona fide functions of glycinoeclepin in plants as well as in the rhizosphere are still to be elucidated. Functions of strigolactones were identified as signals for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and phytohormones years after their identification as signals for parasitic weeds. Strigolactones are also secreted into the soybean rhizosphere, but their composition and dynamics in the rhizosphere have not been reported in soybean [5,54].\n\n\n\nMicrobes\nRhizosphere microbial communities have prominent effects on plant growth and health, including nutrition, disease suppression, and resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses [55\u201358]. Numerous studies support the idea that, in addition to the climate, soil type, plant species, plant genotype, and growth stage are among the factors that regulate the diversity and composition of rhizosphere microbial communities [59\u201361]. There have been several reports on the microbial communities (both bacterial and fungal) of the soybean rhizosphere [62\u201364], and most such communities show a higher abundance of symbiotic rhizobia than does bulk soil [65,66].\nDuring the growth of soybean in the field, bacterial communities change in the rhizosphere [66] but they did not change in bulk soil. These findings suggest that variation in rhizosphere bacterial communities is more influenced by plant growth than by environmental factors. Bradyrhizobium spp. and other potential plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, such as Bacillus spp., are more abundant in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. In one soybean field, both Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii were the predominant species that formed nodules on roots [67]. In another study, although the resolution of the sequence analysis was insufficient to distinguish members of Bradyrhizobium in the field at the species or strain level, Bradyrhizobium spp. showed differential responses at the operational taxonomic unit level [68].\nRhizosphere fungal communities are rather stable during soybean growth at the phylum level, with the highest abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota [69], but community analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer region revealed that the growth stage of soybean determined the diversity of the fungal communities [70]. Fungal communities are also affected by fertilizer application and rhizobium inoculation [70]. Continuous cropping altered fungal composition, with 38 genera increased and 17 decreased; these genera include both potentially pathogenic and beneficial fungi [71].\nA study of field-grown black soybean suggested the involvement of rhizosphere bacterial communities in soybean production [72]. Yields of black soybean grown in the mountainous region around central Kyoto have decreased with no clear symptoms of pathogen infection; therefore, the involvement of microbial communities was investigated [73]. Variations in the bulk soil bacterial communities among farms with similar climate suggested the effect of management practices on the communities. The rhizosphere bacterial communities at each farm differed significantly from those of bulk soil, with the dominance of Bradyrhizobium spp. and Bacillus spp. Network analysis using the Confeito algorithm showed a possible connection between rhizosphere bacteria and soybean growth, although more detailed analysis is necessary [72].\n\n\nLinking metabolites and microbes\n\nIn vitro studies have been conducted to dissect the effects of metabolites on microbial communities. The effects of root exudates of three generations of Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula on the soil fungal community were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the effects of growing plants [74]. Root exudates of Arabidopsis fractionated to obtain natural blends of phytochemicals were also applied to soil. It was found that phenolic compounds from Arabidopsis root exudates showed positive correlation with the number of bacteria in soil [75]. The flavonoid 7,4\u2032-dihydroxyflavone from alfalfa root exudates, which functions as a nod-gene-inducing signal, influenced the interaction with a diverse range of soil bacteria (not limited to rhizobia) when added to soil in vitro\n[76]. Linkage between root-secreted metabolites and microbial communities were also reported in the metabolome and microbiome analyses during development, which indicate a link between root-secreted metabolites and microbial communities [59,77]. Such a link is also suggested by the comparative genomics and exometabolomics analysis in Avena\u2009barbata, in which root-secreted aromatic organic acids are key factors for the assembly of the rhizosphere microbiome [78].\nRoot-secreted metabolites of soybean have been studied in the context of interaction with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and degradation of hazardous pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [79,80]. Inoculation of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans affects the profiles of root exudates of soybean in genotype-dependent manner, with the decrease of sugars and amino acids [79]. Application of soybean root exudates to PAH-contaminated soil resulted in a significant enhancement in the degradation of PAHs by soil bacteria [80]. It has been also reported that in a 13-year experiment of continuous soybean monocultures daidzein and genistein concentrations in the rhizosphere of soybean has a correlation with soil microbial communities, especially the possible linkage between genistein and the hyphal growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [81,82]. Genetic link between the root exudation of flavonoid and the interaction with rhizobia has been suggested from the study on the identification of quantitative trait loci controlling both the affinity to rhizobacterial strains and genistein secretion [83]. The analysis of rhizosphere bacterial communities of hairy roots silenced in isoflavone synthetase revealed that isoflavones exert small but significant influence on the bacterial communities, especially for Comamonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae [38]. Taken together the above literatures point out the linkage between root-secreted metabolites and microbes in the rhizosphere. The molecular basis on this linkage in the soybean rhizosphere is still to be elucidated.\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nIn the past few decades, many studies have shown the importance of plant metabolites and microbes in the rhizosphere. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have further deepened the understanding of plant\u2013microbe interactions in the rhizosphere. Despite this progress, however, most of the key metabolites that facilitate these interactions remain to be characterized at the molecular level, mostly owing to difficulties in the spatiotemporal analysis of metabolites in the rhizosphere. Traditionally, analyses of root exudates or metabolites that are functional in the rhizosphere have been performed in hydroponic culture or in plate media [7,84]. To utilize the functions of these molecules for sustainable agriculture, it is necessary to analyse them in the rhizosphere of field-grown plants [85].\nFor the spatiotemporal analysis of metabolites and microbes in the rhizosphere, non-destructive analysis using sensors is one promising possibility. Various sensors are used in rhizoboxes for the spatiotemporal analysis of metabolites, minerals, and oxygen [86\u201388]. Their use could be expanded to analyse the rhizosphere of field-grown plants to monitor the changes of rhizosphere conditions. The use of coloured molecules is another possibility. Shikonin, a naphthoquinone biosynthesized by members of the Boraginaceae, exhibits a red colour in the rhizosphere [89] and has antimicrobial properties [90]. The production of shikonin in cell cultures has been well characterized [91], and its function as an allelochemical in the rhizosphere of the invasive weed Echium plantagineum has been reported. Juglone from black walnut (Juglans nigra) is another prominent candidate, because it is yellow and is allelopathic [92].\nThe dynamics and their interactions of metabolites and microbes are of particular importance for improving our understanding of plant\u2013microbe interactions (Fig. 4\n). The stability of metabolites varies with the composition of soils. To simulate metabolite dynamics in the rhizosphere, analysis of their movement, degradation, and adsorption onto soil organic matter and clay minerals is needed to be analysed in various soil types, because the stability of metabolites varies with the composition of soils. The spatiotemporal distribution of metabolites and chemicals can be validated and analysed using rhizoboxes in combination with various sensors. As the definition of the rhizosphere is not quantitatively rigorous, the area influenced by plant roots varies with soil conditions, such as the abundance of organic matter, water content, and types of minerals, in addition to the metabolites and microbes in the soil. Defining the functions and area of the rhizosphere at the molecular level could pave the way towards the use of these metabolites and microbes for sustainable agriculture in the era of climate change.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1698":"\n\nIntroduction\nStudies of the last decade have revealed highly complex microbial assemblages associated with different plants and specific plant organs [1\u20133]. The microbial component of the plant holobiont, also termed as plant microbiota (comprising all microorganisms) or the plant microbiome (comprising all microbial genomes) in the rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere has important functions supporting plant growth and health [2\u20135]. Revealing the functionality of plant-microbe interactions and factors involved in community assembly can lead to a better understanding of the plant as a meta-organism and how plants can benefit from their microbial partners [3,6]. Nowadays, crop production is facing many challenges such as climate change, the demographic development, and there is an increasing demand of sustainable production. As microorganisms have shown the potential to be applied as biofertilizers or biopesticides there is increasing interest to integrate them as alternatives to chemical products in agricultural practices [7,8]. Since the 80\u2032s, many researchers have addressed the topic of microbial inoculants [9], however, with limited success in the field. Having more information on plant microbiota in regard to biotic and abiotic stresses, plant genotype, and environmental conditions, it might be feasible to find better suitable candidates or approaches for inoculation in a given environment [7]. Plant microbiota consist of different types of organisms including fungi, archaea and bacteria. Due to the wealth of information available on bacteria and interest from the industry, this review focusses on the bacterial component of plant microbiota and discusses functionalities as well as challenges and concepts in regard to the application of plant-associated bacteria.\nThe keywords for database search were: plant holobiont, microbiome, core microbiome, colonization, endophytes, PGPR, PGPB, plant growth promotion, consortia, beneficial bacteria, formulation, field, agricultural practices, and plant breeding. The main databases were PubMed and Google Scholar.\n\n\nDiversity and functional potential of plant microbiota\n\nBelow-ground plant microbiota\nPlants actively recruit their microorganisms from surrounding microbial reservoirs such as the soil\/rhizosphere, the phyllosphere (i.e. the aerial plant habitat sensus lato or the leaf surface in relation to the external environment), the anthosphere (the external environment of flowers), the spermosphere (the exterior of germinated seed) and the carposphere (the external fruit environment) [3]. Root microbiota are mostly horizontally transferred, i.e. they derive from the soil environment, which contains highly diverse microorganisms, dominated by Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria [10]. However, bacteria may be also vertically transmitted via seeds. Seeds also represent an important source of microorganisms, which proliferate in the roots of the developing plant [11,12]. Plants with their root system provide unique ecological niches for soil microbiota which colonize the rhizosphere, roots and to a certain extent above ground parts [13]. The narrow layer of soil under the direct influence of plant roots, i.e. the rhizosphere, is considered as a hot spot of microbial activity and represents one of the most complex ecosystems [14]. Recently, Donn et al. [15] showed root-driven changes in bacterial community structure of the wheat rhizosphere and found a 10\u2010fold higher abundance of actinobacteria, pseudomonads, oligotrophs, and copiotrophs in the rhizosphere as compared to bulk soil. Moreover, the authors also reported that rhizosphere and rhizoplane communities were altered over time, whereas the bulk soil population remained unaffected. Similarly, Kawasaki et al. [16] reported that the Brachypodium distachyon (a model for wheat) rhizosphere was dominated by Burkholderiales, Sphingobacteriales and Xanthomonadales, while the bulk soil was dominated by the order Bacillales. Root exudates such as organic acids, amino acids, fatty acids, phenolics, plant growth regulators, nucleotides, sugars, putrescine, sterols, and vitamins are known to affect microbial composition around roots, the so-called rhizosphere effect [8,17]. For instance, a group of defensive secondary metabolites like benzoxazinoids (BXs) released by maize roots alter the composition of root-associated microbiota, and microorganisms belonging to Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were found to be most affected by BXs metabolites [18]. Furthermore, Zhalnina et al. [19] investigated the mechanisms underlying the bacterial community assembly in the rhizosphere of Avena\u2009barbata and found that the combination of root exudation chemistry and bacterial substrate preferences drive bacterial community assembly patterns in the rhizosphere. Fitzpatrick et al. [20] reported numerous rhizosphere bacterial taxa particularly belonging to Pseudoxanthomonas having significant differential abundances across 30 angiosperm plant species. Overall, different plant species and genotypes, depending on the type and composition of root exudates, influence the composition of rhizosphere microbiota.\nPlant roots are colonized also internally (root endosphere) by a diverse range of bacterial endophytes. The entry of bacterial endophytes inside root tissues often occurs through passive processes or root cracks or emergence points of lateral roots as well as by active mechanisms [21]. The colonization and transmission of endophytes within plants depend on many factors such as the allocation of plant resources and the endophyte ability to colonize plants. Diverse range of bacterial taxa can gain entry in root tissues, for example, the most abundant phyla often found in grapevine roots were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes and Gemmatimonatedes [22\u201325]. In the roots of rice, Rhizobiaceae, Comamonadaceae, Streptomycetaceae, and Bradyrhizobiaceae were found as most dominant families [26]. As another example, Correa-Galeote et al. [27] found Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes as predominant phyla inside the maize roots and the abundance of these phyla was influenced by soil cultivation history.\n\n\nAbove-ground plant microbiota\nAbove-ground plant tissues such as the vegetative foliar parts, leaves and floral parts, provide unique environments for endophyte and epiphyte diversities, however, there are major differences in the ecology of endosphere and phyllosphere bacteria. Most endophytes spread systemically via the xylem to distinct compartments of the plant like stem, leaves, and fruits [28], although they can also enter plant tissues through aerial parts of the plant such as flowers and fruits [29]. Depending on plant source allocation, different above-ground plant compartments host distinct endophytic communities. It has been reported that phyllosphere bacteria also derive from the soil environment and are driven by the plant and by environmental parameters, however, the latter having a more profound effect [2,23,30]. Consequently, different microorganisms are found in the endosphere and phyllosphere at the genus and species level. For instance, the structural analysis of phyllosphere or carposphere microbiota of the grapevine revealed Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Frigoribacterium, Curtobacterium, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Erwinia, Citrobacter, Pantoea, and Methylobacterium as predominant genera [23,31], whereas analysis of endophytes of grape berries revealed a dominance of the genera Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Mesorhizobium, Propionibacterium, Dyella and Bacillus\n[32]. Recently, Wallace et al. [30] studied the maize leaf microbiome across 300 diverse maize lines and found sphingomonads and methylobacteria as predominant taxa. They also showed that the phyllosphere microbial composition was largely driven by environmental factors. In apple flowers, Steven et al. [33] identified Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae as predominant taxa. Similarly, numerous studies on apple, almond, grapefruit, tobacco and pumpkin flowers found Pseudomonas as the most abundant genus [34]. Only recently, seed-associated bacteria have been addressed and found to comprise mostly Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [11,35\u201337]. Seed microbiota are related to soil microbiota but also to those of flowers and fruits [28,38,39]. Generally, above-ground plant microbiota mainly originate from soil, seed and air and adapt for life on or inside the plant tissue where several factors including soil, environmental and farm management shape community composition. Host and compartment-specific assembly indicate a strong functional relationship between the plant and its above-ground microbiota, however, more research is still required to understand this relationship. Endophytes as well as above-ground microbiota are well known for their potential to promote plant growth, improve disease resistance and alleviate stress tolerance [3,40].\n\n\nFactors affecting plant microbiota\nIn any plant organ microbial composition is influenced by a range of biotic and abiotic factors. These factors may include soil pH, salinity, soil type, soil structure, soil moisture and soil organic matter and exudates [10], which are most relevant for below-ground plant parts, whereas factors like external environmental conditions including climate, pathogen presence and human practices [3] influence microbiota of above- and below-ground plant parts. The plant species and genotype recruit microorganisms from the soil environment where root morphology, exudates, and type of rhizodeposits play a significant role in the recruitment of plant microbiota [1,13,41,42]. Plant species growing in the similar soil environment recruited significantly different microbial communities in both rhizosphere and root compartments [6,24,43]. Using a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenome approach, Bulgarelli et al. [44] investigated the root microbiota of different barley accessions and found that the host innate immune system and root metabolites mainly shaped root microbial community structure. Other host-related factors like plant age and developmental stage, health, and fitness are also known to influence plant bacterial community structure through affecting plant signaling (i.e. induced systemic resistance, systemic acquired resistance) and the composition of root exudates [1,43].\n\n\nCore and satellite microbiomes\nMicroorganisms that are tightly associated with a certain plant species or genotype, independent of soil and environmental conditions, are defined as the core plant microbiome [45]. Pfeiffer et al. [46] identified a core microbiome of potato (Solanum tuberosum) particularly comprising of Bradyrhizobium, Sphingobium, and Microvirga. Similarly, Zarraonaindia et al. [23] found a grapevine core microbiome belonging to Pseudomonadaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Hyphomicrobiaceae independent of soil and climatic conditions. Edwards et al. [26] found bacteria particularly belonging to Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria as a member of rice core microbiome. The core plant microbiome is thought to comprise keystone microbial taxa that are important for plant fitness and established through evolutionary mechanisms of selection and enrichment of microbial taxa containing essential functions genes for the fitness of the plant holobiont [5]. By contrast, some microbial taxa that occur in low abundance in a reduced number of sites are called satellite taxa [47,48]. Satellite taxa can be defined on the basis of geographical range, local abundance, and habitat specificity [49]. The importance of satellite taxa is increasingly being recognized as drivers of key functions for the ecosystem. A recent study further demonstrated that taxa occurring in low abundance are critical for reducing unwanted microbial invasions into soil communities [50]. Similarly, low abundance bacterial species largely contributed to the production of antifungal volatile compounds that protect the plant against soil-borne pathogens [51]. Hol et al. [52] found that the loss of rare soil microbes can have a negative impact on plant productivity. Numerous studies suggest that satellite taxa (rare taxa) provide critical functions that might be disproportionate to their abundance. There are various ecological reasons that explain satellite to core dynamics that need to be addressed to better understand the functions and buffering capacity of plant microbiome against various environmental stresses.\n\n\nFunctions of plant microbiota\nThe members of plant microbiome comprise beneficial, neutral or pathogenic microorganisms. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can promote plant growth by either direct or indirect mechanisms. Some PGPB produce phytohormones like auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin which affect plant growth through modulating endogenous hormone levels in association with a plant. Moreover, some PGPB can secret an enzyme, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which reduces the level of stress hormone ethylene in the plant. Strains of Pseudomonas spp., Arthrobacter spp. and Bacillus spp. and others have been reported to enhance plant growth through the production of ACC deaminase. Rascovan et al. [53] found a diverse range of bacteria including Pseudomonas spp., Paraburkholderia spp. and Pantoea spp. in wheat and soybean roots that showed important plant growth promotion properties like phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, indole acetic acid and ACC deaminase production, mechanisms involved in improved nutrient uptake, growth and stress tolerance.\nSome bacteria can cause disease symptoms through the production of phytotoxic compounds proteins and phytohormones. For example, Pseudomonas syringae is a well-known plant pathogen having a very broad host range including tomato, tobacco, olive and green bean. Another well-known pathogenic bacterium is Erwinia amylovora that causes fire blight disease of fruit trees and ornamentals plants. Xanthomonas species, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Xylella fastidiosa are also associated with many important diseases of crops like potato and banana [54]. The severity of plant disease depends on the combination of multiple factors like pathogen population size, host susceptibility, favorable environment and biotic factors (like plant microbiota) that collectively determine the outcome of plant-pathogen interaction [4]. Both below-ground and above-ground plant-associated bacteria have been shown to enhance host resistance against pathogen infection either through commensal-pathogen interactions or through modulating plant defense [55,56].\nThere are numerous examples of biocontrol activities against pathogen invasion and disease [57,58] through the production of antibiotics, lytic enzymes, pathogen-inhibiting volatile compounds and siderophores. Some bacteria protect the plant from pathogens through modulating plant hormones level and inducing plant systemic resistance. The continuous use of agricultural soils can build pathogen pressure and can also develop disease-suppressive soils containing microorganisms mediating disease suppression [59,60]. In particular, genera like Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Burkholderia and Paraburkholderia have been reported for their role in pathogen suppression [61,62]. Recently, Trivedi et al. [63] identified three keystone bacterial taxa belonging to Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes that controlled the invasion of Fusarium wilt at a continental scale. Carri\u00f3n et al. [64] reported disease-suppressive ability of Paraburkholderia graminis PHS1 against fungal root pathogen and linked soil suppressiveness with the synthesis of sulfurous volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide reductase and cysteine desulfurase. Dur\u00e1n et al. [60] reported the role of endosphere bacterial community on take-all disease (Gaeumannomyces graminis) suppression and they identified endophytes belonging to Serratia and Enterobacter as most promising candidates against Gaeumannomyces graminis.\n\n\n\nEmployment and modulation of the plant microbiome\n\nMicrobial inoculation\nThe development of a single strain application typically starts with a screening of a strain collection for various plant growth-promoting characteristics in the laboratory. Screening assays mainly rely on specific microbial functions like phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation or the production of antibiotics, siderophores, plant hormones and ACC deaminase. In a bottom-up approach, the most promising strains are then tested in the greenhouse followed by further testing in the field. Using this approach many bacterial strains show great success in the lab and greenhouse conditions but fail in the field [65] to increase suboptimal plant microbiome. For instance, Hungria et al. [66] found that Azospirillum brasilense strain Ab-V5 increased grain yields of maize and wheat up to 30 and 16%, respectively, in field trials. Other researchers tested Kosakonia radicincitans formulations effect on maize in three different field plots and bacterial application was highly effective in improving maize silage as well as grain yield [67]. Contrarily, other studies found no significant effects with bacterial inoculation under field conditions. For example, Azospirillum brasilense (strain Ab-V5 and Ab-V6) inoculation increased growth of maize and wheat under controlled conditions but showed no significant effect on plant growth in the field [68]. Similarly, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii inoculation significantly increased biomass of rice plants in the greenhouse but did not show a significant increase in plant biomass and yield in the field [69]. There are numerous reasons being potentially responsible for the limited success of microbial inoculants in the field and the low reproducibility. It has to be considered that microorganisms in the receiving environment are highly diverse and well adapted and that an introduced microorganism is not able to compete sufficiently with the resident microflora. However, competitive ability of an inoculant strain is usually not a selection criterion. Also, the dosage of introduced cells as well as the physiological activity will influence the competitive ability of an inoculant strain [70]. To warrant the delivery of a certain dosage of cells as well as shelf-life, suitable formulations are key to successful application. An additional important aspect is whether the strain is suited to colonize the respective plant species, genotype or tissue and whether it is also able to exhibit the desired function in the receiving environment. For instance, for certain biocontrol functions (e.g. antagonistic activities) it will be important that the biocontrol strain colonizes the same niches as the pathogen at the same time and also exhibits antagonistic activities. These activities might be tightly regulated and will also depend on microbiome or plant holobiont interactions. In contrast, if biocontrol activity is based on triggering plant defense, as it was shown for the biocontrol strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 [71], early colonization is required.\n\n\nThe application of microbial consortia\nThe application of microbial consortia is an emerging approach to overcome lab to field hurdles [56,72]. The rationale of this approach may be the combination of microorganisms with different traits, either complementing each other to combine different mechanisms needed for different effects such as plant growth enhancement and biocontrol of pathogens. Microbial consortia may also comprise strains showing the same mode of action but tolerate different environmental conditions or plant genotypes. Various studies on grapevine [73], potato [56], tomato [58], Arabidopsis [74] and maize [75] have shown that microbial combinations have the potential to increase plant growth-promoting (PGP) effects as compared to single inoculants (Table 1\n). Moreover, combinations of bacteria that show no or little PGP effects as single inoculants can show PGP effects in a consortium, ranging from the combination of three bacterial species that live in one biofilm [74] to the application of whole microbiomes [58,76]. However, some consortia have shown to reduce the PGP effect as compared to single inoculants [56,73,77] indicating that a smart and knowledge-driven selection of consortia and strains is required.\nOne interesting and promising approach has been applied by Hu et al. [78]. The authors present an ecological framework and showed that the survival of introduced Pseudomonas consortia increased with increasing diversity. Furthermore, high Pseudomonas diversity decreased the incidence of the pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum due to intensified resource competition and interference with the pathogen. This concept makes use of ecologically based community rules and the author also showed that a higher diversity of Pseudomonas consortia resulted in higher accumulation of plant biomass and more efficient assimilation of nutrients into the plant tissue [79]. Pseudomonas strain identity was less important than the diversity effect, which was associated with a higher production of plant hormones, siderophores and solubilization of phosphorus in vitro.\nIn some cases it might be relevant to consider the source of a consortium or consortium member to match the environmental conditions (soil type, climate and plants) of a PGP candidate to the field condition where the inoculant strain will be applied. For example, Azospirillum spp. preferred to colonize the rice cultivar they were originally isolated from [80] and Actinobacteria are more persistent in drought soils [81]. The strategy of matching conditions of origin field and applied field cannot only increase the success of establishment but also the probability of finding bacteria that exhibit a desired PGP effect. The isolation of bacteria associated to plants exposed to pathogens led to the discovery of the biocontrol agent K84 against the crown gall disease [82] and to a consortium of six endophytes preventing tobacco wilt disease [59]. Likewise, the screening of symptomless plants that are exposed to abiotic stresses led to the identification of bacteria that support plant resistance to metal and organic pollutions and are useful in bioremediation [83\u201385]. In accordance, nutrient-solubilizing bacteria are more common under nutrient-poor conditions [86]. All in all, the origin of an inoculant strain may provide important information on its ecological behaviour relevant for field application.\nThe bottom-up selection process to identify candidates for a plant growth-promoting consortium starts with a collection of bacteria and investigates interactions in culture-dependent screenings [87]. Candidates in axenic culture are characterized and selected by bacterial stress resistance (desiccation, temperature or toxic compounds) and plant growth-promoting activities [87\u201391]. Classical laboratory tests are partly replaced by screening of the underlining PGP genes [5]. Although successfully used in many studies as a selection criterion [5,83,92], the efficiency of PGPB does not necessarily correlate with the abundance of genetic and molecular plant growth-promoting traits in bacteria [93\u201395]. The utility of the detection of PGP-traits in axenic cultures and in their genomes depends on the mechanistic understanding of a particular trait. Lab screenings may provide only limited information. As an example, one Pseudomonas strain that can establish antagonistic activity against Phytophthora infestans was outgrown by another Pseudomonas strain in co-culture and lost upon co-inoculation its biocontrol ability [56]. However, in nature, bacteria can avoid competition by colonizing different microniches and compartments limiting the usefulness of studying in vitro bacteria-bacteria interactions without plants.\nWith the size of the starting collection of potential PGPB, the possible combinations for PGP-consortia increase exponentially. Furthermore, various abiotic factors (temperature, moisture, nutrient content of soil etc.) lead to variable trade-offs that result in variable PGP-effects in plants [58,72]. To handle this inextricable amount of combinations, networks that use limited input data (e.g. presence\/absence of a combination of bacteria, nutrient supply in the growth medium) have been used to predict the plant phenotype (phosphate content of Arabidopsis thaliana) [77]. Using this concept improving the selection of PGP-consortia is possible without understanding the mode of action and interactions of the bacterial members. In addition, a synthetic biology approach to design microbial consortia combining desired mechanisms, pathways and interactions is a promising approach.\nTop-down approaches allow to study microbiome characteristics at a molecular level and to select for PGP-consortium candidates based on this information. This became feasible with the direct identification of core and satellite microbiota in environmental samples based on single amplicon variants in high throughput sequencing of nucleic acids [96], as described above. The advantages of top-down approaches are a pre-selection of candidates under realistic field conditions exposed to a realistic stress scenario while bottom-up screening approaches mimic field conditions in a simplified environment.\n\n\nFormulation requirements and delivery approaches\nFormulations are needed to ensure long-term viability of cells during storage and the provision of sufficient viable cell numbers to field-grown plants. Unfortunately, suitable formulations are lacking for many microorganisms, particularly for Gram-negative bacteria [97] and viability in formulations is often limited by the tolerance of bacteria to low humidity [98]. Several compounds use on formulations might improve PGP-effects. Experiments adding lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LOCs) isolated from rhizobia to formulations [99] or adapting the growth medium of an inoculant to increase exopolysaccharides (EPS) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) content in the formulation [100] increased for instance the PGP-effects. The mechanisms of bacterial additives are not yet understood, while surfactants adjust droplet size and rheological properties, reduce drift and improve adhesion to hydrophobic cuticular surfaces [101]. Macrobeads that encapsulate PGPB provide a humid environment as well as nanoparticles, which improve adhesion of PGPB to roots [102,103]. In general seed, leaf and soil inoculation techniques of the same PGPB successfully increased yield of wheat in field studies [67]. Seed inoculants might interfere with pesticides employed for seed treatment but establish the plant first and can build up microbial defences (activation of plant immune response, biofilm production), while in mature plants, an existing microbiome must be suppressed for establishment [44,104].\nIn addition to the classical delivery approaches new methods have been developed. A seed microbiome modulation concept was developed by Mitter et al. [39]. The authors used a spray inoculation of flowers to achieve next generation seeds endophytically colonized by the inoculant strain and a modulation of the seed microbiome. The inoculant strain efficiently colonized the germinated plant, also under field conditions, showing that alternative approaches may lead to improved performance of microbial inoculants.\n\n\n\nModulation of plant microbiomes by agricultural management and plant selection\n\nImpact of agricultural management on plant microbiota\nSpecific plant microbiota are associated with certain plant traits such as disease suppression [105], biomass production [106] and growth response [107] or the flowering phenotype [108]. Consequently, modulation of plant microbiota or effects of agricultural management will impact plant traits and performance (Fig. 1\n). This is an alternative to single or microbial consortia inoculation.\nCrop diversification, organic approaches, intercropping and other cultural practices have been used for sustainable agricultural production. Albeit few data exist on practices influencing the plant microbiome, fertilization, low or no tillage, protection of biodiversity, and other practices, in general it has been reported that low-input farming systems promote higher abundance and diversity of most organisms [109]. Understanding how cultural practices influence the plant microbiome may lead to strategies to modulate the plant microbiome in a desired direction (Fig. 1). Campisano et al. [32] showed for instance that organic or integrated pest management lead to the build-up of different soil and plant microbiota associated with grapevine. Similarly, Longa et al. [110] showed that different agro-management practices in viticulture (organic, biodynamic or biodynamic with green manure) induce different microbiota, particularly the green manure treatment resulted in major differences as compared to the organic and biodynamic management practices. Vineyards, where integrated, organic and biodynamic management practices had been in place for 10\u202fyears, were also assessed. Soil under integrated management had a significantly reduced bacterial species richness compared to organic management but community composition was similar to organically and biodynamically managed soils [111]. In addition, Hartmann et al. [112] demonstrated further the impact of more than two decades of different agricultural management in a long-term field experiment on the soil microbiome. Compared to conventionally managed soils, organic farming appears as increasing the soil microbial richness of winter wheat and grass clover, but also decreased evenness, reduced dispersion and shifted the soil microbiota structure [112]. Authors showed that organic fertilizers influence microbes involved in degradation of complex organic compounds, while pesticides also impact soil microbiota but to a lower degree [112]. Recently, Hartman et al. [113] furthermore showed pronounced cropping effects on community composition on soil and roots of winter wheat. The authors demonstrated that soil bacterial communities were primarily structured by tillage and root bacteria by management types, whereas fungal communities responded mainly to the management type with additional effects due to tillage. Different practices influence the microbial composition with differences according to soil, roots, bacteria and fungi. Around 10% of variation in microbial communities could be explained by the tested cropping practices [113]. Our understanding of the interaction between practice conditions and the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem has advanced. However, the effects of agro-management and other factors such as environment are highly complex and more understanding is required to make clear-cut recommendations.\n\n\nSelection of plants for efficient interaction with plant microbiota\nCrop breeding programmes have yet to incorporate the selection of adequate plant microbiomes [62] (Fig. 1). Different plant genotypes behave differently in regard to interacting with microbiota and attract different microbiome members conferring resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses or help for plant growth and nutrition [114]. It is therefore possible to design or select plants with the ability to attract beneficial microbiota [115]. Nevertheless, limited understanding exists which plant mechanisms and underlying genes lead to the association with specific microbiota or how certain microbial activities are influenced. Plant breeding programmes have gone through selection of specific and improved plants, however, in many cases with a loss of plant genes compared to wild-type plants or wild relatives [116]. Wild plants have evolved specific microbiota but this selection was disrupted with the domestication of important crops [116]. Domestication has led not only to the loss of genetic plant diversity but also to a reduction of microbial diversity associated with plants and a loss of the capacity to interact with specific plant growth-promoting microorganisms [117]. Plant breeding should consider the associated microbiome within the holobiont, to confer additional plant traits or to modify them. However, this approach is impeded by still insufficient understanding of microbiome functioning, mechanisms of plant-microbiome interactions and a lack of simple high throughput screening methods. Nevertheless, selection and breeding of plants for their association with beneficial microbiota is highly promising in regard to delivering a new generation of microbe-improved plants.\n\n\n\nConclusions and future prospects\nPlant microbiota and their interactions are highly diverse and multiple factors shape community assembly and functioning. While recognized since the 19th century, the investigation of and interest in plant-associated microbiota only started to bloom since the 80\u2032s. Due to the high potential of microorganisms to improve plant growth, stress resilience and health, numerous microbial inoculants have been developed, but many of them show poor performance in the field. Several approaches may lead to improved field success such as designing smart microbial consortia, the selection of agricultural management practices favoring microbiota with beneficial functions or a new generation of plant breeding approaches. Last but not least the development of suitable formulations and delivery approaches is highly important for any field application. Our understanding of plant microbiota, its functionality and its exploitation has substantially increased in the last years. However, a better understanding is needed on how inoculants modulate the resident microbiome, how complex microbiota and the holobiont affect the activity of the applied strain or how microbial inoculants colonize the plant environment in the field.\n\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe authors have declared no conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nCompliance with Ethics Requirements\n\nThis article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.\n\n\n","1699":"\n\nIntroduction\nAll the aboveground surfaces of a plant that represent microbial habitats are referred to as the phyllosphere [1]. In particular, leaf surfaces host a dense population of bacteria (i.e., epiphytes) estimated to reach 107 bacteria per cm2 of leaf surface [2]. Despite the high cell density, leaf surfaces are a challenging ecosystem to colonise and grow on. Epiphytes must cope with constant ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, low water and nutrient availability and large temperature fluctuations throughout the day, making leaves an extreme environment [3].\nRecent culture-independent sequencing methods have shown that leaves host bacterial communities that are compositionally consistent within a plant species [4\u20136]. However, little is known about the factors that shape these communities. Although there is increasing evidence that non-pathogenic leaf-colonising bacteria may stimulate plant growth and provide protection against different stresses [7\u201314], the functions of most of these bacteria, their dynamics at the community level, and their interactions with the plant host remain largely unknown.\n\n\nThe leaf surface\nThe leaf is a highly structured and multi-layered plant organ (Fig. 1\n). Its microtopography is determined by the first cell layer, namely, the epidermis, which consists of different cell types that regulate many aspects of leaf physiology, such as gas exchange, temperature regulation, and water and secondary metabolite secretion [15].\nThe most common cell type in the epidermis is the pavement cell, which contributes to leaf shape. Within the layer of pavement cells, more specialised epidermal cell types are embedded [15]. Stomata, which are pores formed by two guard cells that act as turgor-driven valves to regulate gas exchange and transpiration, are an important feature of the epidermis [16]. Some plants develop modified stomata called hydathodes, which are pores found at the end of the vasculature on leaf margins [16]. Because these structures cannot regulate their pore aperture, hydathodes maintain a continuous pathway for water and solute secretion, a process known as guttation [17]. Another type of specialised epidermal cell are outgrowths called trichomes, which are either glandular or non-glandular [15]. Glandular trichomes are secretion organs that release a wide spectrum of exudates, such as polysaccharides, salts, lipids, volatile compounds, and proteins, the functions of which are associated with plant-plant, plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions [18,19]. The functions of non-glandular trichomes may include water retention and absorption, light reflection to reduce the impact of UV radiation and heat, and increased freezing as well as drought tolerance [18].\nThe epidermis is covered by a cuticle, i.e., a waxy layer that provides a physical barrier against abiotic and biotic stresses and determines the physicochemical properties of the leaf surface. The cuticle is formed by an extracellular polymer membrane composed of a matrix of cross-linked polyhydroxy fatty acids and glycerol called cutin. This matrix is interspersed with polysaccharides and a complex mixture of long-chain aliphatic compounds, which are overlaid on and\/or impregnated in the matrix (cuticular waxes) [20]. Aliphatic compounds render the cuticle hydrophobic and determine the physicochemical properties of the leaf surface, such as its permeability and wettability, which limits water and solute diffusion from inner cell layers to the leaf surface and the adherence of particles to the surface [21\u201323].\n\n\nImpact of leaf topology and physicochemistry on microbial life on leaves\nThe organisation of leaf epidermal cell types defines leaf physiology and shapes an intricate microtopology that influences the distribution and abundance of microorganisms on the leaf surface [24\u201326]. The establishment of these microhabitats depends on the physicochemical properties of the leaf surface and the ability of microorganisms to adapt and modify this environment [27]. Epiphytes are often found in aggregates or biofilms, likely because these microenvironments protect bacteria from harsh environmental conditions [24,28]. Large bacterial aggregates have been predominantly found at the bases of trichomes, above veins, and in epidermal cell grooves [29,30], where water and nutrients are more prevalent.\nThe permeability and wettability of the leaf cuticle is likely to be one of the most important properties of the leaf surface that influences the ability of microbes to colonise this habitat [31]. Cuticular permeability determines the diffusion rate of compounds from the apoplast onto the leaf surface, while wettability influences the retention of water droplets on the leaf surface [22,32].\nPermeation plays an important role in the growth and survival of epiphytes by allowing the leaching of water and compounds to the phyllosphere, making nutrients accessible for microorganisms. An aqueous pathway contributes to compound permeation across the cuticle with facilitation from aqueous pores preferentially found on cuticular ledges of guard cells, at the base of trichomes, and over the cuticle of anticlinal cell walls [33]. Sites on the leaf surface that are characterised by higher permeation rates are also more densely colonised by bacterial communities [34]. Bacteria can modulate cuticular permeability and wettability through the production of biosurfactants such as syringafactin, which is released by Pseudomonas syringae\n[31,35,36]. Increased cuticular permeability not only affects water diffusion but also alters sugar availability for sustained epiphytic growth [37]. In situ fructose availability to the leaf-colonising bacterium Pantoea eucalypti 299R (formerly known as Erwinia herbicola and Pantoea agglomerans\n[38,39]) in the bean phyllosphere was found in sites containing aqueous pores [32,40,41]. The patchy distribution of carbon sources on bean leaves promotes differentiation of the P. eucalypti population into subpopulations differing in access to fructose [40]. Thus, permeation of photosynthates across the cuticle is exploited by epiphytic microorganisms, allowing them to survive and thrive. Besides modulation of leaf physicochemistry by phyllosphere-associated microbes, changes in leaf chemistry can also be attributed to abiotic and biotic soil conditions [42\u201344]. However, the extent to which plant-soil feedbacks influence the assembly of phyllosphere microbial communities are yet to be determined.\nThe topography and physicochemical properties of leaves render the phyllosphere an oligotrophic and heterogeneous habitat for epiphytes. It is also possible for microorganisms to construct niches on the leaf surface in response to interaction with the plant [45]. Although discrete hotspots on the leaf form microhabitats in which bacterial populations can be sustained [46], the impact of these microhabitats on the assembly and establishment of bacterial communities is not yet understood.\n\n\nComposition of phyllosphere-associated microbial communities\nAdvances in cultivation-independent methods and next-generation sequencing techniques have led to a better understanding of the composition and diversity of plant microbiota. Although plants host a wide variety of microbes, bacteria are far more abundant than eukaryotes and archaea [47,48]. Bacterial communities on plants are dominated by only four phyla: the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes [1,49,50]. Although bacterial community composition and abundance are host specific, members of the Alphaproteobacteria are predominant and ubiquitous in phyllosphere microbiotas, and within this class, the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas are consistently detected among different hosts [47]. Plant-colonising bacteria are thought to share mechanisms of adaptation to leaf surfaces, considering the high overlap between the proteome of phyllosphere microbiotas and the identification of a core set of genes potentially involved in adaptation to plant colonisation in over 3000 plant-associated bacterial genomes [47,51,52].\n\n\nSpatially explicit ecology of bacteria on leaves\nDue to the leaf's heterogeneous nature, the composition and abundance of bacterial communities at the whole-leaf scale are not sufficient to understand the drivers of community assembly [46]. Therefore, the importance of spatial information becomes increasingly apparent for understanding community structure (Fig. 2\n). In the example given in Fig. 2, the same community composition on a whole-leaf scale can be explained by different interspecies correlations such as different levels of co-aggregation, segregation, or random distributions (Fig. 2C, D, or E, respectively). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), a method commonly used to visualise and identify microorganisms in their environment, has been used to describe the distribution patterns of taxonomically different bacterial groups within the phyllosphere [2]. This study, the first investigation of the spatial distribution of phylogenetically different taxa colonising leaf surfaces under different environmental conditions, estimated the likelihood of bacterial taxa co-aggregation in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere. Bacterial aggregates can be either monoclonal or polyclonal. Monoclonal aggregates represent the offspring of single cells, while polyclonal aggregates are formed by the aggregation of multiple cells in one location [53]. Distantly related taxa can form mixed aggregates, even though members of the same phylogenetic group have the highest probability of co-aggregation. However, due to the technical limitations of the FISH probes used in that study, it is unclear which individual species contribute to the observed aggregation patterns and whether co-aggregation of the same phylogenetic groups is a result of local monoclonal aggregate formation of an individual species or mixed populations. In general, aggregation between different taxa is observed at a distance of less than 5\u202f\u00b5m. A similar approach taken to study the spatial distribution and colonisation patterns of two fluorescently tagged bacterial strains (P. eucalypti 299R and P. syringae B728a) on bean leaves provided similar results [26]. In an investigation of the spatial aggregation between the bacterial strains and topological features of the leaf, the strongest correlations were found between bacterial colonies and epidermal cell grooves within distances of up to 12\u202f\u00b5m, and adjacent to glandular and non-glandular trichomes within 60 and 120\u202f\u00b5m, respectively. Closer examinations of spatial relationships between bacterial species and their surroundings could shed light on the functional and metabolic diversity within aggregates and communities in the phyllosphere.\nIndividual bacterial cells can significantly change the concentration of solutes, such as nutrients in their environments, within a distance of approximately ten times their cell's diameter. This distance can be effectively interpreted as an \u201cinteraction distance\u201d, where fluxes of compounds and metabolites can diffuse from cell to cell [54]. This interaction distance of cells without direct physical contact is in good agreement with the observed scales of bacterial aggregation in the phyllosphere. Recently, cell-to-cell interactions on porous surfaces were found to be higher when the aqueous phase was fragmented, which increased the probability of direct physical interactions between cells [55]. These findings can be extrapolated to the leaf surface, as its segregated nature should result in a high prevalence of cell-to-cell interactions [56]. Evidently, community assembly on leaves is strongly determined by factors acting at a micrometre resolution [46].\n\n\nEcological drivers of bacterial community assembly\nRecently, a framework of community assembly was proposed for microbial communities in the phyllosphere [57]. The framework proposes that community structure is driven by four main processes: (1) dispersal, (2) diversification, (3) ecological drift, and (4) selection (Fig. 2A). First, dispersal is the immigration of microorganisms onto the leaf surface, which can occur via seed inoculation, rainfall, animal transmission vectors, bud burst colonisation, and bioaerosols [57]. Second, the emergence of new genetic variation through evolutionary diversification may affect community diversity. As UV radiation and\/or reactive oxygen species can lead to increased mutation rates, low-abundance taxa might be a genetic reservoir for horizontal gene transfer; furthermore, bacteria can exhibit dormancy [58]. Third, ecological drift relates to changes in the abundance of taxa due to stochastic events. This process is assumed to have greater effects on low-abundance taxa, which may become extinct at local scales [59]. Lastly, selection is the deterministic fitness differences between species within a community, which can be due to internal and external determinants, such as species interactions and environmental factors, respectively.\n\nMicrobe-microbe interactions\nIn general, the effect of microbial interactions in shaping community structure can be divided into cooperation, parasitism and competition. Cooperation describes interactions that are beneficial to at least one species and do not cause harm to the other, while the latter type refers to interactions that are detrimental to at least one species. Mutualism is a type of cooperative interaction in which both species benefit from each other, while commensalism is an interaction between two organisms in which one partner benefits while the other is not impacted. Microorganisms would be commensals when, for example, one microbe produces non-metabolisable substrates and\/or growth factors that positively affect the commensal [60,61]. However, to be considered a true commensal, the organism should not influence their interaction partner at all, which although theoretically possible, is highly unlikely in practice. The alternative term \u201ctritagonist\u201d has been proposed for these organisms instead [62]. The effect of cooperative interactions in shaping the structure of phyllosphere bacterial communities has not yet been investigated. However, an example of cooperation has been observed using synthetic communities from the maize rhizosphere, in which the removal of a keystone species led to the collapse of other bacterial populations [63]. Another kind of mutualism may occur between fast growing bacterial species and fungal pathogens infecting host plants, as the latter seemed to increase bacterial richness and diversity [64]. However, this depends on specific microbe-microbe interactions, as the fungal and oomycete species Dioszegia sp. and Albugo sp., respectively, have been shown to decrease the bacterial species diversity of the A. thaliana leaf microbiota [45].\nParasitism in the phyllosphere is mostly driven by virus-bacterium interactions. Bacterium-infecting viruses (i.e., bacteriophages or phages) are found in most (if not all) ecosystems and can alter community dynamics by influencing bacterial diversity, nutrient cycling, and species interactions [65]. Phages impose strong selection on bacterial members of the leaf microbiota at a local scale and in short time periods, affecting the microbiota composition [66,67].\nCompetitive relationships involve detrimental effects for at least one species, which may be a result of interference or exploitation competition. When competition is the result of active mechanisms of species exclusion, this interaction is known as interference. The most common example of interference is antibiosis, in which a species secretes compounds that are toxic to the other. This effect is also the case for epiphytes; for example, P. agglomerans E325 has been shown to suppress the growth of the phytopathogen Erwinia amylovora on apple flowers through antibiotic activity [13]. Exploitation competition is the dispute for shared resources, such as nutrients or space. In this relationship, one of the species has compromised population growth, resulting in either complete spatial exclusion or coexistence [68]. Fructose and sucrose, for example, are limiting resources during phyllosphere colonisation [40]. In bean leaves, the amount of available sugars on the leaf surface decreases rapidly to a tenth of the initial concentration upon colonisation of Pseudomonas fluorescens A506 [69]. The availability of sugars is also limited by its permeation from the apoplast to the leaf surface, and sugars may not be replenished at rates supporting the survival of large bacterial populations [40].\n\n\nEffect of resource overlap on species interactions\nCooperative and competitive interactions greatly depend on the metabolic capabilities of the members of a microbial community, that is, the potential of the microbes to uptake, metabolise, and secrete an array of nutrients and other compounds (e.g., siderophores or antimicrobials). The degree of shared nutritional requirements between species, i.e., nutrient or resource overlap, may shape microbial communities, as shown by the fact that nutrient overlaps in naturally occurring bacterial communities are higher than expected based on null models [70]. When estimating nutrient overlaps between over 6000 pair of bacterial species, Freilich et al. (2011) found a positive correlation with the competition potential between species in a community and negatively with the cooperation potential, suggesting that the higher the nutrient overlap between the species in a community is, the more likely these species are to compete for shared nutrients and, consequently, the less likely they are to cooperate with each other [71]. However, nutrient overlaps cannot solely predict the nature of species interactions e.g. it has recently been shown that close relatedness and similarity in gene expression between pairs of algal species, and thus similarity in their metabolisms, was correlated to facilitation, stabilising coexistence [72]. In addition, other factors such as priority effects can influence species interactions through, for example, niche preemptions or niche modifications [73]. Resource utilisation accounts for only a fraction of a species\u2019 niche; thus, the spatial context, environmental conditions, and biotic relationships should be considered when positioning species in their ecosystems.\nAn operational approach for comparing species\u2019 nutrient utilisation profiles is to determine a resource overlap index between pairs of species. In phyllosphere studies, Wilson and Lindow introduced the niche overlap index in 1994 [74], which relates to the number of carbon sources utilised by two species as a proportion of the total carbon sources used by one of the species. Two issues arise from this formulation: (1) the index is asymmetrical, such that one species can have total overlap while the other only partial overlap, as is the case for specialist and generalist species, respectively; and (2) by measuring only the ability of a strain to consume a carbon source independently, information is lost about the species\u2019 affinity for that resource, which may lead to false interpretation of the potential for two species to coexist based on their nutrient preferences. Instead, symmetrical indices that account for the proportions of utilised nutrients are more informative and less biased [75].\nThe major drivers of community assembly in the phyllosphere are currently unclear. As the phyllosphere is generally oligotrophic, cooperation and competition may have a major impact on community assemblies in the phyllosphere.\n\n\nThe host as a driver of bacterial community structure\nPlants provide habitats that support different bacterial communities [4,76]. Although bacteria share a core set of adaptation mechanisms to colonise and thrive on plants [4,47,51], community composition is, to some degree, host specific [6,76\u201379]; thus, changes in bacterial diversity, abundance, and community structure can be attributed to host factors and specific bacterial adaptation mechanisms. For example, bacterial community composition is influenced by host species, genotype, plant traits (e.g., cuticle composition), leaf age and host developmental stage; the latter two factors are often indistinguishable from seasonal effects [25,79\u201384].\n\n\n\nPlant responses to microbial colonisation\nIn addition to providing a habitat for microorganisms, plants interact with their associated microbiota. Recent findings suggest that the plant immune system plays a role in shaping the bacterial community [80,85], thereby indicating an active role of the host plant in modulating the composition of its associated microbiota.\nThe plant immune system consists of two layers. The first layer of immunity, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), is elicited by conserved molecular structures such as microbe\/pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs\/PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns, which are perceived by plasma membrane-localised pattern recognition receptors [86,87]. A prominent example of pattern recognition receptors is the receptor flagellin sensing 2 (FLS2), which recognises a 22-amino-acid peptide of bacterial flagellin (flg22) [88]. The significance of MAMP\/PAMP recognition in limiting pathogen growth was shown in a fls2 mutant exhibiting enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae pathovar (pv.) tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) [89]. Recently, comparison of plant responses to the growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 and its cognate flg22 peptide showed that the whole organism elicited only about half of the plant transcriptional responses compared to the purified flg22 peptide alone. Genes that were only upregulated in the flg22-treated plants were enriched for defence-related transcriptional responses, suggesting that P. simiae WCS417 suppressed a significant number of defence-associated genes [90]. Whether plants recognise non-pathogenic bacteria and modulate their response to limit unnecessary costly defence are still unknown.\nTo subvert PTI, microbial pathogens release so-called effector proteins [91]. Effector proteins from different microbes target overlapping sets of plant proteins. Most of the targeted plant proteins are considered hubs of highly interconnected protein-protein interaction networks. Hence, targeting these proteins will likely result in strong perturbations of the host's immune response [92,93]. As a countermeasure, plants have evolved additional intracellular receptors, which are often nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), that directly or indirectly recognise effector proteins, thus forming the second layer of plant immunity, designated effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [94,95]. Recently, a study on microbial genes important for adaptation to the plant environment identified 64 plant-resembling plant-associated and root-associated domains (PREPARADOs). Some PREPARADOs resemble NLR domains. This finding suggests that bacterial proteins containing PREPARADOs might compete with NLRs for effector binding, thereby restricting bacterial detection by the plant [51].\n\nPlant responses are finely tuned\nAlthough the same signaling networks seem to be employed during PTI and ETI, they are used in a different manner, generating specific outputs of immunity level. While the relationships between different signaling pathways in PTI are partly synergistic and partly compensatory, they are exclusively compensatory during ETI [96,97]. As MAMPs can be found on pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria, it seems reasonable that PTI is less robust or more tunable than ETI, allowing the host to avoid recurrent fitness costs [98]. Synergism between signaling pathways enables the plant to elevate the output of its immune response when multiple MAMPs, providing more information than a single MAMP, signal a pathogen.\nDifferent MAMPs have been shown to activate different immune signaling pathways with varying strengths, leading to diverse immune outputs (Fig. 3\n) [99]. Such differential use of the immune signaling network likely allows plants to induce appropriate defence mechanisms against pathogens with different lifestyles during PTI. For example, salicylic acid signaling is known to be effective against biotrophs, pathogens that feed on living host tissue, and hemibiotrophs, pathogens that first feed on living host tissue and later feed on dead host tissue. In contrast, jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling is effective against necrotrophs, pathogens that feed on dead host tissue [100]. Furthermore, tunability of the immune network presumably enables plants to limit costly immune responses to non-pathogenic colonisers.\nRecently, two non-pathogenic bacteria were shown to elicit unique transcriptional and metabolic responses that differed from those of a pathogenic bacterium, indicating that plants differentiate bacteria [7,101]. Since the availability of carbohydrates clearly affects bacterial community composition [102,103] and plants actively deprive the apoplast of monosaccharides upon pathogen encounter to limit pathogen growth [104], plants likely also supply certain carbohydrates by sugar exporters [105] to support beneficial bacterial populations. Such responses are likely to be spatially explicit, as the bacterial composition on the leaf is heterogeneous and the same carbohydrate might promote the growth of spatially separated populations of beneficial and non-beneficial bacteria. However, plant responses at a high spatial resolution are currently underinvestigated in the context of plant-microbe interactions. Local plant responses may have important implications for leaf surface-colonising bacteria and bacterial community composition.\n\n\nLocal and systemic plant host responses to microorganisms\nPlant immune responses to pathogens can be divided into local and systemic responses (Fig. 3). Local immune responses at the infection site comprise early calcium ion (Ca2+) influx and MAP kinase and calcium-dependent protein kinase activation within minutes, followed by reactive oxygen species production, defence gene activation and after several hours, callose deposition and hypersensitivity response resulting in programmed cell death, which is regarded as a hallmark of ETI [106]. A cell type-specific local response is stomatal closure, which occurs within an hour after bacterial recognition to restrict the bacteria from entering the apoplast (Fig. 3). However, some bacterial pathogens, such as Pst DC3000, are able to modulate stomatal aperture [107]. In addition to local responses, pathogens also elicit systemic responses, such as systemic acquired resistance, conferring broad spectrum resistance against biotrophic pathogens to plant parts that have not been in contact with the pathogen [108]. Recently, the impressively fast propagation of systemic Ca2+ signaling throughout the plant in A. thaliana (approximately 1\u202fmm\/s) was shown to be mediated by glutamate, which is released upon wounding [109].\nStudying plant epigenetic, transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolomic changes in microorganisms at the whole-tissue level does not allow us to study local and systemic responses separately. Moreover, tissues are mixtures of different cell types that react differently to microorganisms. In a recent study, local responses to the biotrophic pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsis were shown to differ markedly from systemic responses [110]. This finding highlights the importance of performing -omic studies at a high spatial (potentially single-host cell) resolution to identify the nature of plant responses. To perform cell type-specific and single-cell studies, the cell type of interest must be isolated from the surrounding tissue. Root hairs are likely the simplest cell type to isolate as they can be separated from frozen root tips by stirring with a glass rod [97]. Other cell types demand more sophisticated techniques for isolation; these types can be divided into two groups. Microscopy-assisted techniques such as capillary extraction [111], atomic force microscopy-based extraction [112] and laser capture microdissection [113] allow the isolation of cells or cell material with direct spatial context. With regard to plant-microorganism interactions, capillary extraction was used to study transcriptional changes of barley cells infected by powdery mildew [114]. Cell\/nuclei sorting or affinity purification methods such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting of protoplasts [115], fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting [116], isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types [117], and \u201ctranslating ribosome affinity purification\u201d (TRAP) [118] allow the isolation of larger numbers of cells or more cell material. However, the spatial information is only indirect, and the techniques rely on cell type-specific markers.\nPlants shape their associated microbiotas. Consequently, plants need to be considered as a driving factor of community composition in bacterial ecology studies. To study the role of the plant host in shaping microbiota, new controls must be found that distinguish between fast active plant signaling and comparably slow changes in physicochemical properties of leaves. To that end, studies can be performed on artificial plants, ranging from plastic tomato plants in a field context [119] to artificial leaves in the laboratory [120\u2013123]. Such studies should progress to a more refined spatial scale, as bacterial colonisation is heterogeneous, plant responses are likely also heterogenous.\n\n\n\nConclusions and future perspectives\nThe relatively static physicochemistry of the leaf surface as well as dynamic microbe-microbe, microbe-plant and plant-mediated microbe-microbe interactions are drivers of plant microbiota community composition. These factors do not homogeneously influence the bacterial communities on leaves; instead, there might be markedly different communities on the same leaf. Such spatial heterogeneity of leaf-colonising microbial communities is not only due to the heterogeneity of the leaf surface and heterogeneous microbial colonisation but also likely due to plant responses that may differ between individual cells of the same leaf. Since the plant immune network is highly tunable, it presumably enables plants to limit costly immune responses to non-pathogenic colonisers, and on a more refined spatial scale to respond differently to distinct microbial colonisers. Heterogeneous colonisation patterns are thus likely to translate into heterogeneous plant response patterns.\nIn the future, more emphasis should be placed on spatial heterogeneous differences in colonisation and plant responses to further our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive bacterial community composition and assembly. By resolving (1) the effect of microbe-microbe interactions, (2) the function of non-pathogenic bacteria on the plant and (3) the role of the host in shaping community structure, will give bottom-up

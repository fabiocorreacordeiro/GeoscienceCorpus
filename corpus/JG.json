This paper investigates the geochemistry of the Upper Permian andesites (Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation) and the Late Permian\u2013Middle Triassic plutonic rocks (Selenge plutonic rock complex) of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous body, and intermediate dike intruding into them, and discusses the Late Permian\u2013Middle Triassic magmatism of the Siberian continental margin. These rocks show a linear distribution on the variation diagram. They are therefore likely to be derived from a single magmatic source. The rocks, characterized by low K2O\/Na2O, high Sr\/Y, high La\/Yb, and high Sr\/La ratios are adakitic rocks of basaltic slab-melt origin. The samples are enriched in Cr and Ni and have a high Mg# compared with the typical slab-melt. This is likely due to an interaction between the slab-melt and the overlying mantle peridotite during its ascent. The Nb\/Ta variation of the samples may point crustal contamination to the magma. The paleolatitude of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation is calculated to be 37.1\u00b0\u00a0N based on thermal remanent magnetization. Therefore, the Late Permian\u2013Middle Triassic large-scale adakitic igneous activity had taken place in the volcanic arc along the Siberian continental margin in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The geochemical characteristics of the intermediate dike are almost the same as those of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation and the Selenge plutonic rock complex, indicating that adakitic igneous activity continued after the Early Triassic.\n               ","1":"\n                  The Ordos Block in the western part of the North China Craton is enigmatic in having contrasting topographic structure in the northern and southern parts, while previous geophysical studies show little difference in crustal and upper mantle structure across the region. Here we present a new model of upper mantle structure in the Ordos Block region in order to test the importance of mantle heterogeneity for topographic differences. Our model is based on P- and S-wave seismic receiver functions calculated for data from 171 stations. It documents the presence of an uppermost mantle low-velocity zone between the Mid Lithospheric Discontinuity (MLD) and the Lehmann discontinuity. Clear converters at the 410 and 660\u00a0km discontinuities show constant Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) thickness within the Ordos Block region, which indicates that no deep mantle thermal anomaly affects its present dynamics. However, the amplitude of the MTZ-converters is higher in the southern than the northern Ordos Block. In contrast, the conversions from MLD and the Lehmann discontinuity are strongest in Northern Ordos, which we interpret as a block with essentially preserved cratonic lithospheric mantle. We speculate that smaller amplitudes of the MLD and Lehmann converters in Southern than Northern Ordos may be related to either rheological weakening of cratonic lithosphere during the Mesozoic convergence between the North and South (Yangtze) China Cratons, or northeast extrusion of Tibetan lower crust and upper mantle in the Cenozoic caused by the India-Asia collision.\n               ","2":"\n                  On 22 May 2021 (CST), an Mw7.4 earthquake struck Maduo County, Qinghai Province, China, which was the largest seismic event in China since the 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. Several scientific questions associated with the event could be addressed: (1) what fault slip model can explain the Maduo earthquake? (2) what effects do historical earthquakes impose on the Maduo earthquake? and (3) what implications does the Maduo earthquake have for future rupture potential of adjacent tectonic faults? So we conduct a comprehensive study to answer the three questions by collecting satellite SAR images, GPS data, seismic waveform data, historical earthquakes, and aftershocks associated with the Maduo earthquake. The estimated fault slip model shows that the Maduo earthquake ruptures two faults in a manner of dominant sinistral strike-slip motion, with slip peaks of ~4.8\u00a0m occurring near the surface. The minor fault to the east dips to the south accommodating an obvious reverse slip, well consistent with reverse fault scarps, reverse faulting aftershocks, and significant upward surface displacements immediately south of this branch. Such a reverse slip is probably controlled by the motion of nearby major sinistral strike-slip faults (the Eastern Kunlun fault and the Maduo\u2013Gande fault). Among 32 historical Mw\u2265\u00a06.0 earthquakes used in this study, we find that the 1937 Mw7.8 Huashixia earthquake may affect the Maduo earthquake most, delaying its occurrence by decreasing the Coulomb failure stress (CFS) at the hypocenter by >\u00a01\u00a0bar and on the entire causative fault by an average of 0.68\u00a0bar. Besides, the Mw6.1 Yangbi earthquake, which occurred ~4.5\u00a0h ahead of the Maduo earthquake, appears to make little influence on the Maduo earthquake because it hardly perturbates the CFS at the hypocenter of the Maduo earthquake. Furthermore, the cumulative CFS change due to both the 32 historical earthquakes and the 2021 Maduo event indicates that the Tuosuo Lake\u2013Maqu segment of the Eastern Kunlun fault may be at high risk of future rupture.\n               ","3":"\n                  In seismic hazard assessment, subsurface geophysical surveying has gained popularity in recent years towards fault mapping and determining seismic deformation parameters such as fault offset, recurrence, and depth of fault, locating proper trench sites based on the subsurface information. In the present study, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to (1) locate the trace of the southern segment of the Ulsan fault, (2) to test the applicability of ERT techniques for active fault mapping in a close to the highly urbanized and complex geological environment with a slow tectonic activity. We have applied the ERT technique at five sites. At one place, we used the Wenner array, Schlumberger array, Dipole-Dipole array, and Seismic-profiling techniques to know which method provides a better result in complex geological conditions like Korea. Out of these methods, the Dipole-Dipole array provided high-resolution results and was used for the other two sites. The ERT result shows high and low resistivity zones interpreted as bedrock (mainly Tertiary and Cretaceous formations) and coarse fluvial sediment layer, respectively. The maximum vertical displacement recorded along the fault varies from 6\u00a0m to 12\u00a0m. Based on the ERT results, two trenches were excavated to directly investigate the deformation pattern associated with the southern segment of the Ulsan fault. The ERT and trench survey results support that the southern Ulsan fault has slipped multiple times since Quaternary. Using this multi-approach, ~5\u00a0km long active fault map was prepared for the southern Ulsan Fault. It is found from this study that the integrated approach is highly beneficial where contrasting sub-lithological units exist in terms of their physical properties, even though human activity or the ongoing urbanization process has modified the surface morphology. This study argues for judicious use of ERT techniques to delineate the shallow subsurface geology across various active faults in the Korean peninsula and similar tectonic settings.\n               ","4":"\n                  Water levels in anthropogenic reservoirs are often studied in terms of the influence of their fluctuation to pressure perturbations in the bedrock and possible triggering of nearby seismic activity. In this paper, we examine the possibility of a similar relationship in the West Bohemia\/Vogtland region on the border of the Czech Republic and Germany. This area is well known for the occurrence of earthquake swarms that are located mainly around Nov\u00fd Kostel village with the Horka dam nearby, just 5\u00a0km to the E-SE of the seismogenic zone. We are looking for any evidence of a mutual relationship between rainfall and the water level at the Horka dam and the seismic catalog that contains more than 25,000 nearby events for the period 1995\u00a0\u2212\u00a02019. For this purpose, we applied the methods of cross-correlation and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). The analysis was performed on both full and declustered seismic catalogs and on the full time series and the series averaged over a single-year period. No significant correlation was found between the hydrologic and seismic data; the seismic activity occurs randomly in time. The SSA method found strong seasonal variations of the water level in the dam with annual periodicity; however, no similar periodicity was found in the rainfall and seismicity data. Our results show that not only the earthquake swarms, but also the background seismic activity have no relationship to the rainfall or water level in the Horka dam. The hypothesis of hydrologic triggering of the seismic activity in the area appears rather unlikely and other mechanisms should be studied in more detail to account for the earthquake swarms\u2019 occurrence.\n               ","5":"\n                  In early March 2021, three shallow earthquakes, two mainshocks with M6.3 and M6.0 and one major aftershock with M5.6 impacted both the mountainous Damasi-Tyrnavos region (northern Thessaly, Greece) and the adjacent Plio-Quaternary basin. Each major event was followed by rich aftershock activity recorded by local and regional seismographs and accelerographs. Herein, we present a comprehensive analysis of the seismic sequence, from its foreshock activity starting on 28 February, 2021 and for a period of two months using new high-resolution catalogues of relocated earthquakes and hundreds of focal mechanisms. The results indicate that the aftershocks form a zone that spans ~50\u00a0km NW-SE, while focal depths range between 5 and 15\u00a0km. More than 400 focal mechanisms, computed for events with M\u2265\u00a02.5, mainly exhibit normal faulting in a NW-SE direction, while WNW-ESE to E-W normal faulting is also evidenced, in particular after the occurrence of the last major event on 12 March. The stress-field was reconstructed on a local and broader scale by inverting focal mechanism data, revealing a rotation of the \u03c3\n                     \n                        3\n                      axis trend from NNE-SSW, in the Damasi-broader region, to NW-SE northwards, to the region of Kozani-Grevena that hosted an M\n                     w =\u00a06.6 shallow mainshock in 1995. Subcrustal seismicity, present beneath those areas, implies that large-scale tectonics and plate dynamics are likely involved in the deformation of the upper crust. Coulomb stress transfer after the 3 major events of the 2021 Damasi-Tyrnavos sequence reveals that stress-loaded areas include those where most aftershocks were triggered. The analysis provides implications to the seismic hazard of the activated area, as a major NW-SE active normal fault close to Larissa city became stress-loaded, constituting a possible candidate source for significant future earthquakes.\n               ","6":"\n                  The character of arcs varies over time with significant temporal fluctuations in the quantity and spatiotemporal patterns of magmatism. However, the driving mechanisms for this episodic behavior of arcs need more constraints. This paper analyzed the published data along with our new zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotopic and whole-rock geochemical data of plutonic rocks in the Gangdese belt in southern Tibet to explore the features, potential drivers, and tectonic implications of episodic arc activity in the Gangdese arc. A comprehensive compilation of U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopic analyses of zircon grains from igneous rocks in the Gangdese belt, sedimentary rocks in trench fill sequences, forearc basins and foreland basins, and sands from modern river reveals that: 1) Gangdese arc activity was episodic during Late Cretaceous to Middle Eocene, displaying two magmatic flare-ups (ca. 100\u201380 and 65\u201345\u00a0Ma) and one magmatic lull (ca. 80\u201365\u00a0Ma), and 2) both flare-up magmas show relatively positive \u03b5Hf(t) values (+5 ~ +15) indicative of juvenile sources suggesting these magmas are dominated by contributions from the depleted mantle. In contrast, the magmatic lull between these two magmatic flare-ups could be caused by flat subduction of the Neotethyan slab beneath the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane. These flare-ups likely contributed greatly to the crustal thickening of the Gangdese belt. Constraints from paleo-elevation and geochemical proxies for crustal thickness showed that the ~100\u201380\u00a0Ma flare-up was accompanied by the formation of a thick arc root while the ~65\u201345\u00a0Ma flare-up likely developed in a thinner crust without an arc root.\n               ","7":"\n                  In a recent paper published in the Journal of Geodynamics (vol. 137, June 2020, 101733), Fonseca et al. (2020) proposed a thought-provoking model aiming to elucidate the exhumation history of the Neoproterozoic Bras\u00edlia Fold Belt (BFB) between the Devonian and Cretaceous periods. Exclusively based on information from the literature and new thermochronological data, Fonseca et al. (2020) presented an alternative model that tries to bind tectonic uplift, erosion, and the influx of clastic material coming from the BFB into the intracratonic Paran\u00e1 Basin. Although the welcome proposal and reliable quality of the analytical data, the hypothesis presented diverges from several previously published works. In the light of the presented apatite fission-track ages, we disagree with their paleogeographical model, which puts the Bras\u00edlia Fold Belt as a major source for clastic detritus to the Paran\u00e1 Basin between the Devonian to Permian. The primary goal of our comments is to clarify the state-of-art of the intricate source-to-sink system of the Paran\u00e1 Basin. Secondarily, we try to demonstrate why the model proposed by Fonseca et al. (2020) presents some geodynamic and interpretative problems and do not characterize an adequate paleogeographic scenario for southwest Gondwana between the Devonian to Permian periods.\n               ","8":"\n                  The fractal geometry and extent of seismicity in the Baikal Rift System (BRS) are estimated from data on 52,700 instrumental events of M\n                     LH \u2265\u00a02.5 magnitudes for fifty years (1964\u20132013). The seismic pattern is characterized by the box-counting Hausdorff dimension D\n                     0, multifractal spectra f(\u03b1), and surface area S of seismicity at three scales: the rift system as a whole, its three zones, and six subzones. The multifractal spectra record a self-similar hierarchical structure of the BRS seismicity pattern. The space and time variations in the fractal dimension (D\n                     0) and area of seismicity (S), which are mapped and plotted as a function of time, show good correlation. The two parameters depend on three related factors: progressive increase in the amount of instrumental data (dataset size), structure of seismogenic fault network, and geodynamic activity. They increase as ever more data appear with time and acquire high local values at increasing extent and density of quakes. Moreover, the obtained D\n                     0 estimates reflect statistical self-similarity of earthquake patterns being in the range \u2248\u00a01.45\u20131.55 over most of BRS, except one zone and one subzone in the rift flanks. They are the highest in the southwest and the lowest in the northeast of the rift system (D\n                     0 \u2248\u00a01.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and D\n                     0 \u2248\u00a01.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 respectively). This dissimilarity indicates that seismogenic faulting occurs by different mechanisms: distributed failure as a result of superposed global-scale collisional compression and regional rifting in the SW flank and quasi-linear rift propagation in the NE flank. In general, D\n                     0 decreases toward the northeastern part of the BRS, where the pattern of earthquakes becomes localized along lineaments instead of being distributed over an area. The space and time variations of D\n                     0 and S revealed in the earthquake data are consistent with the location and activity pulses of rifting attractors and provide a realistic explanation of BRS geodynamics and tectonophysics. The global lithospheric compression and the regional pulse-like activity of rifting attractors control the network of seismogenic faults which, in turn, govern the fractal geometry and 2D structure of seismicity in the region. The obtained results confirm the oscillatory dynamics of the regional seismicity at a decadal period correlated with activity pulses of rifting attractors. The oscillations stand out against the background of decreasing global low-frequency secular cycle of the BRS seismicity. The BRS lithospheric geodynamics fits the model of a nonlinear oscillator with dissipation. The suggested analysis of the fractal geometry and extent of seismicity as proxies of the faulting evolution provides insights into modern geodynamics of the Baikal Rift System and its constituents.\n               ","9":"\n                  The Raohe accretionary complex (RHC) is located at the eastern of northeast China and adjacent to Russian Far East. As a part of the Circum-Pacific Orogenic Belt, it is the unique region of the accretionary orogenic belt, which is associated with the subduction process of the Panthalassic-Pacific Plate (PPP). We synthesize the detrital zircon ages of terrigenous clastic rocks of the RHC and tectonic units along the East Asian Continental Margin (EACM) to clarify its provenance. Then we place the docking position of the RHC adjacent to the South China Block, and determine that the final accretion of the RHC occur during the later Late Jurassic (~150\u00a0Ma) according to combination for ages of stitching plutons and terrigenous clastic rock. Integrating with the published global-scale plate kinematic frame, we restored the pre-docking motion path of the RHC using the Gplates software. The reconstructed scenario shows that it is a long distance of at least 1000\u00a0km between the proto-RHC and continent margin when the basaltic volcanism occurred subaqueously within the abyssal basin of the PPP. This model also provides a probability that the proto-RHC and the proto-Yuejingshan accretionary complexes have the same drift history, before their simultaneous emplacement into the continental margin.\n               ","10":"\n                  The Black Sea is a deep marine basin formed by lithosphere extension and active rifting in a back-arc tectonic setting, by general consensus, in the Cretaceous. Its present structural architecture, however, is mainly defined by compressional tectonics during the Cenozoic when large scale \u201cbasin inversion\u201d reactivated extensional fault systems formed in the Cretaceous. Rifting during the Cretaceous is usually taken to represent the main process forming the present-day basin (that is, producing crustal thinning and concomitant subsidence prior to its modification during Cenozoic inversion). Rifting at this time took place within continental lithosphere that had been accreted to and, by the Cretaceous, formed part of the Eurasian lithospheric plate. The precise history of how and when pre-Cretaceous aged tectonic domains were accreted to Eurasia forming the continental lithosphere underlying the Black Sea is poorly known. A critical issue to the tectono-thermal evolution of the Black Sea basin with important implications for paleogeography and sedimentary depositional environments is the degree of crust (and lithosphere) thinning during Cretaceous rifting and whether oceanic or \u201csub-oceanic\u201d crust was formed at that time. The main focus of this paper, in order to illuminate this issue, is on kinematic observations related to the Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) rifting phase, including subsidence analysis, as well as the immediate post-rift sedimentation and stratigraphy. The results suggest that rifting during the Cretaceous was insufficient in its own right to reveal exhumed mantle or to promote ocean crust formation beneath the deep basins of the Black Sea. It is concluded that an important contribution to observed present-day crustal and lithosphere architecture of the Black Sea area are legacy extensional tectonic events affecting the area in pre-Cretaceous times, with implications for the Late Palaeozoic-Mesozoic paleogeography and paleotectonic evolution of this area.\n               ","11":"\n                  The ability to mitigate and predict volcanic risk is a long-standing question in the Geosciences\u2019 community, while the extent of volcanic activity may be regulated by a predictable and periodic external excitation induced by seasonal rainfall, hydrological loading, or Moon-Sun gravitational force. Moreover, the complex stress-triggering, hydro-mechanical coupling in response to seasonal rainfall, and associated feedback mechanism with deep magmatic process remains enigmatic and indeed deserves more attention in view of recent climate change scenario. In this letter, a compelling scenario of seasonal rainfall-triggered eruption cycles of Mount Etna (Italy) is found and presented on the eastern coast of Sicily which continuously erupting since last 200\u00a0kyr. Results show that the seasonal rainfall significantly weakened the Mount Etna edifice and initiated mechanical tensile failure in the complex magmatic plumbing system and adjacent flank surface by changing the pore pressure build-up, probably promoting dyke intrusion and eventual triggering of eruptive cycle. Further, the possibility of seasonal hydrological loading on the Mount Etna volcano and adjacent flank region, hydrological load-induced sliding along the impermeable outer \u2018shell\u2019 of the flank are discussed, and the effect of tidal stress perturbations on the eruptions cycle cannot be ruled out completely.\n               ","12":"\n                  The Vardar Zone is a product of the Triassic-Jurassic opening of the Neotethys, Jurassic obduction, Late Cretaceous\/Paleogene consumption of the oceanic crust and continental collision. During the last process, the Eastern Vardar Zone was thrust over the Central and eventually both onto the Western Vardar Zone. The present paleomagnetic and structural study provided new results from the first two zones in the Belgrade area. The younger set of data, together with published ones from the third zone, provide firm evidence for about 30\u00b0 clockwise vertical axial rotation of the Vardar Zone between 23 and 18\u00a0Ma, connected to extension driven by the roll-back of the Carpathians lithosphere.\n                  Earlier, the Vardar Zone was affected by intensive compression generating a nappe pile, comprising the Eastern, Central and Western Vardar Zones. This assembly was eventually thrusted over CCW rotating Adriatic elements in the Paleogene. The rotation triggered a system of right lateral strike slip faults between different tectonic slices in the Vardar Zone. This tectonic model offers a plausible explanation for the paleomagnetic directions of post-folding age of the Upper Cretaceous flysch of the Central Vardar Zone.

We have the impression that many of the remarks, at least to some extent stem from a misunderstanding of our manuscript, also considering that they did not propose any alternative hypothesis for interpretation of our results presented in the aforementioned paper. We, thus, reiterate our interpretations from our low-temperature thermochronology data. The basement of the Brasilia Belt was subject to a significant exhumation during the Devonian to the Permian through erosion, and was likely a source area for detrital sediments deposited in parts of the northeastern Paran\u00e1 Basin at that time.

A spectacular feature of the Black Sea magnetic field is the Alushta-Batumi anomaly (ABA) above the SR that could be an imprint of subduction-related Middle Jurassic magmatic arc, whereas the Cretaceous (in Eastern Pontides) magmatic arc manifests itself by a chain of magnetic anomalies on the southern shoreline of the Black Sea. The high-velocity heterogeneity, revealed by seismic tomography, could be an image of a slab due to Mesozoic (Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous) subduction of the northern branch of Neotethys ocean. It shows rather a flat subduction slab that plunges northwards from subcrustal depths south of Eastern Pontide to the depth of >\u00a070\u201380\u00a0km below the SR. Middle Jurassic and Cretaceous subduction fronts are located closely in the region of Eastern Pontides, whereas the related magmatic arcs are spaced differently \u2013 over the SR for the Middle Jurassic arc and along the southern coastline for Cretaceous Eastern Pontide magmatic arc correspondingly. The latter could be caused by the opening of the EBSB in the Cretaceous that separated the eastern segment of the BS onto the Eastern Pontides \u2013 Arkhangelsky Ridge and the SR \u2013 Northern Caucasus domains.\n               ","15":"\n                  The 2017 Chiapas earthquake with moment magnitude Mw =\u00a08.2, caused seismic induced surface motion which has been well recorded and analyzed globally using broadband seismometers. In contrast, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements of absolute receiver positions at cm accuracy have been marginally used for seismic wave analysis. We show that GNSS station displacement measurements, located in North America, can detect traveling seismic surface waves through a GNSS network for the 2017 Chiapas earthquake with a single station precise point positioning (PPP) measurement accuracy of 1\u20132\u00a0cm, evaluating 1\u00a0Hz data. We found that the network data show a total amplitude in temporal filtered horizontal displacement data of up to 5\u00a0cm, which is in good agreement with absolute measurements of a broadband seismometer. The multi constellation (primarily GPS and GLONASS) GNSS measurements are most sensitive to seismic surface waves such as e.g. given by Love and Rayleigh wave components in the frequency range of 20\u201335\u00a0s determined by FTAN (Frequency Time Analysis) where the Rayleigh component dominates the measured GNSS signals. We provide estimates of phase velocities and epicenter location determined by a cross-correlation procedure and evaluate its accuracy within the framework of a comparison to state-of-the-art seismic models. Hereby GNSS station data suffer from double measurement noise in the vertical displacement component, which results in a low signal to noise ratio that deny proper pressure wave analysis. While the derived phase velocities have typical uncertainties of 200\u00a0m\/s in standard deviation, which may seem inappropriate for geophysical interpretation of a single station they might be appropriate in a large and dense GNSS network (spatial distance <\u00a025\u00a0km). Determination of the seismic source location is possible and even offers the ability to provide tsunami early warning. Consequently, we see GNSS network station data may be a complementary and independent observation type \u2013 prior to well established geophone or accelerometer measurements \u2013 which is suited for seismic wave detection and analysis, although limited in accuracy.\n               ","16":"\n                  The position of the middle-upper Miocene volcanic arc, encompassing the Maghrebides, the Sardinia Channel and the Sardinia-Corsica block, implies that the Algerian and Tyrrhenian basins developed, respectively, as backarc and forearc extensional zones in the Western-Central Mediterranean. The opening of the Western-Central Mediterranean Neogene extensional basin has been commonly interpreted as a two-step process: the opening of the Proven\u00e7al-Algerian basin during the early-middle Miocene, followed, in the late Miocene, by the formation of the Tyrrhenian Basin. This article is an attempt to synthesize knowledge about the hinge zone between Algerian and Tyrrhenian basins by combining the analysis of seismic reflection profiles with dredge and borehole data in order to investigate how the transition between the eastern Algerian backarc and Tyrrhenian forearc geodynamic settings took place. We identified three sectors: the western Tyrrhenian characterized by a Tortonian forearc extension; the Sardinia Channel, which preserves the architecture of the lower Miocene Maghrebian thrust belt formed during the collision between Europe and Africa plates; and the easternmost Algerian basin-Sicily Channel where a backarc\u2013thrust belt system developed during the Tortonian stage. During the extensional events, we hypothesize the re-activation of inherited structures during Tortonian rifting, (that is a negative tectonic inversion of pre-existing Eocene and early Miocene thrust faults). The contemporaneity of two different geodynamic environments, the forearc extension in the northern area and backarc\u2013thrust belt system in the southern area, can be directly related with a lateral variation of the lower plate paleogeography of the Africa continental margin. This evidence contributes to the understanding of how the paleogeography of the lower plate can control, to a certain extent, the tectonic evolution of the upper plate in a subduction setting.\n               ","17":"\n                  The geodynamic events of continental breakup and origin of northwest Indian Ocean led to the development of passive continental margin, off western India.

The basement is identified as continental rift basalt, different from the Deccan\/Madagascan basalts. We suggest the basement eruption at ~75\u00a0Ma causing igneous underplating which triggered the extension\/rifting in Laxmi and Gop basins. The rifting translated into ocean spreading only in the Gop Basin and not in the Laxmi Basin.

Here, we present detailed field investigation and kinematic analysis of the plutonic-metamorphic complexes in the Yuanbaoshan and Sanfang areas of the west Jiangnan orogenic belt, which enables identification of extensional granite-cored domes. In the dome margins, down-dipping lineations display a radial pattern and dome dominated foliations are extensively developed. The shearing structures within the plutonic-metamorphic complexes display extensional shearing surrounding the Yuanbaoshan and Sanfang granitic dome cores. Gneissic granites and massive ones from both the Yuanbaoshan and Sanfang plutons yield comparable crystallization ages of ca. 835\u2013823\u00a0Ma that are within age errors of each other, as are the sheared recrystallized asymmetric quartz veins and mylonites dated at 831\u00a0Ma. Overall ages of the deformed Sibao Group and the undeformed overlying Danzhou Group, along with those of the granite plutons and mylonites, suggest formation of the granite-cored domes at ca. 835\u2013823\u00a0Ma, coeval to the timing of emplacement of the granitic plutons. Locally, top-to-the-E thrusting structures are also observed in the west Yuanbaoshan and Sanfang areas and are inferred as at ca. 860\u2013835\u00a0Ma, coinciding well with E- or SE- directed structures developed elsewhere in the Jiangnan orogenic belt, but in contrast with doming extensional shearing structures. Therefore, overall geometry and kinematics in the west Jiangnan belt indicate development of granitic dome related extensional ductile shearing deformation dated at ca. 835\u2013823\u00a0Ma and a possible top-to-the-E compressional ductile thrusting deformation within 860\u2013835\u00a0Ma. Given the previously inferred regional geology observations, along with age and chemical data across the Jiangnan orogenic belt, the dominant extensional shearing deformation in the region argue for a slab roll-back event within an accretionary belt, typical of domes-and-basins structures formed in accretionary convergent continental margin. The top-to-the-E thrusting is here interpreted as corresponding to compressional regime generated by the west directed subduction of oceanic crust beneath the northern Guangxi continental margin arc in the west Jiangnan orogenic belt.\n               ","19":"\n                  This study is based on a careful analysis of high-quality reflection seismic sections located at the tip of the NW South China Sea V-shaped rift basin.

Based on these, we propose a kinematic restoration and quantify the amounts of extension and associated strain rates. We discuss the link between the kinematic evolution and the sedimentary and magmatic record and illustrate it in a Wheeler Diagram. Relying on the identification and characterization of distinct stratal patterns and crustal architectures, we propose qualitative and quantitative criteria to interpret two critical rift events that are necking and hyperextension. These two events are linked to the individualization and subsequent dismembering of a so-called keystone, here referred to as H-block. It is the first time such an approach is used to decipher the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of a complete syn-rift mega-sequence across present-day conjugate rifted margins. This study differs from previous interpretations of correlative surfaces in the distinction between: (1) different types of top basement; and (2) syn- and post-tectonic packages within the syn-rift record. It leads to new interpretations of the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the NW South China Sea and has the potential to be used as a new approach to analyze, quantify and correlate events recorded in seismic sections across rifted margins.\n               ","20":"\n                  In this study, we retrieved the finite source characteristics of the October 23, 2011 Van earthquake (Mw 7.1) using the teleseismic waveforms to focus on the source location. The outstanding off-fault aftershock sequence of the Van mainshock was readily explained by calculating the Coulomb stress changes imparted to the surrounding crust. This may be accomplished through finite source modelling to examine the stress interaction between the fault, ruptured by the Van mainshock, and the surrounding fault(s) triggered by the same mainshock. In addition, to provide further support for the Coulomb failure stress changes in the off-fault area, centroid moment tensor (CMT) inversion of the off-fault aftershocks was performed and stress tensors were derived from their focal solutions. This identified the dominant fault slip, the constraints of the crustal stress fields and illuminated the crustal nature of the stress interaction. The off-fault aftershocks showed a strike-slip stress regime in rotational (to NW) and non-rotational (to N) stress fields of the upper and lower crusts, respectively. However, this was inconsistent with a horizontal compressional stress direction striking to the north. This suggests that a local source and\/or rotation of lateral variation in stress magnitudes in crustal and sub-crustal structures strongly perturbed the regional stress field. It was also evident that these strike-slip aftershocks increased the intensity of stress in an off-fault area, NE of the source rupture. This revealed a uniquely triggered strike-slip motion, activated and rooted in the weak lower crust. We conclude that the Van mainshock rupture source area, associated with the stress changes imparted to the surrounding crust, had undergone anomalous modifications to generate distinctive off-fault aftershock responses in the entire crust, and also triggered and loaded the weak lower crust. We hypothesize that the strike-slip motion, the so called \u201ctransfer fault\u201d, as a distinctly triggered slip event, was generated or selectively activated by subcrustal ductile processes in the absence of mantle lid beneath the study area. However, local slab fragmentation, tearing and cold mantle beneath the study area lead to paradigm changes in interpreting the strike-slip motion and subcrustal deformation. The presence of a small piece of oceanic lithosphere, consistent with fragmented, torn slab and cold mantle, may be an alternative hypothesis that remains to be tested. The Van earthquake, combined with careful examination of associated off-fault aftershocks, revealed new information about stress field constraints on subcrustal deformation. This investigation also provided insights into an important role of stress interaction, with a newly discovered transfer fault within the off-fault area, which extends through the entire crust beneath Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek areas.\n               ","21":"\n                  The only Late Cretaceous-Paleocene intraplate magmatic unit of southern Patagonia, known as the Las Mercedes basalt, is petrogenetically studied in its geodynamic context. The outcrops of this unit are thin ridges located in a narrow 50 km wide latitudinal strip (\u223c48 \u00b0S) of the central region of the Deseado Massif, generated by pahoeoe-type lava flows that probably covered large ancient streams and rivers. Compositionally the rocks are metaluminous basanites and alkaline and subalkaline basalts uninfluenced by slab-derived components with Mg# ranging from 53.9\u201365. The origin of this intraplate igneous manifestation would have been related to the opening of a Late Cretaceous-Paleocene trench-perpendicular slab tear of the Aluk subducting plate. This event induced the decompression melting of the sub-slab silica-deficient garnet pyroxenite asthenosphere causing the extrusion of a discrete volume of basalts. The slab anisotropy was generated by the slab-dip change in a transition region from a flattened sector (north of \u223c48 \u00b0S) related to a large flat-slab (Nal\u00e9 flat-slab) to one with steeper subduction angle (south of \u223c48 \u00b0S). Also, this slab tearing would be responsible for the anomalous occurrence of intraplate magmatism located in the same latitudinal strip of the Las Mercedes basalt but in the Andean magmatic arc region, which together represent the only Late Cretaceous igneous activity unrelated to the magmatic arc in central-southern Patagonia and southern Andean region.\n               ","22":"\n                  Total Electron Content (TEC) derived from satellite-based measurements has been widely used for the detection of ionospheric perturbations associated with earthquakes.

These stations operate within seismogenic zones of three earthquakes in Pakistan and Tajikistan. We implement a statistical technique on daily TEC for the detection of PEIA. The results show that PEIAs appear in the form of enhancement during 08:00\u201312:00 UT (LT\u2009=\u2009UT+5\u2009h) within 5\u201310 days before the mainshock.

It supports the anomalous signatures observed in the temporal and spatial distributions during the particular days. The geomagnetic and solar indices show no activity.

The initial stress has been reported as playing a critical role in this process; however, the stress changes, especially those caused by the significant first subevent of the Wenchuan earthquake are not well understood. Here, we employ a three-dimensional finite element model of the Sichuan-Yunnan region to analyze the stress change caused by the significant first subevent and explore the possible influence on the following ruptures. The results indicate that the auxiliary maximum principal compressive stress (SH) associated with the significant first subevent was horizontal and that the auxiliary stress regime was SH>Sh>Sv, supporting the ongoing regional thrust motion near the southwestern segment of the rupture plane. However, in the northeastern segment, the auxiliary stress regime transitioned to SH>Sv>Sh, demonstrating that the stress changes promoted the transition of the rupture behavior from predominantly thrust motion in the southwest to right-lateral strike-slip motion in the northeastern segment, which was also supported by the dominant shear stress change and the subtle normal stress change along the fault plane in the northeastern segment. In addition, our modeled results also indicate that the orientation of the maximum principal compressive stress changed from SEE to northeastward NEE along the strike of Longmen Shan Fault Zone. This anticlockwise rotation hastened the rupture behavior transition, suggesting that both the initial stress and the stress changes associated with the first subevent jointly controlled the following northeastward rupture of the Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake.\n               ","24":"\n                  The solid-state mantle flow is an important factor that controls the mass and heat transfer in the solid Earth. This study aims to provide a simple picture of three-dimensional (3-D) mantle flow patterns in the sub-arc region of subduction zones based on the results of 3-D steady-state numerical models with varying subduction parameters. Here, the mantle wedge flow pattern is evaluated based on the azimuthal directions of the mantle inflow from the back-arc and the down-dip outflow. The outflow direction generally parallels the subduction direction, but the inflow direction relative to the outflow direction depends on the local subduction obliquity \u2013 the angle between the subduction direction and the strike-normal axis of the subducting slab. A change in the strike of the slab leads to a change in the obliquity and thus the inflow direction. Such change is common along curved margins as the strike of the slab tends to follow that of the margin, or vice versa. Along convex-arc-ward margins, the mantle inflow is deflected towards the region of lowest obliquity but with reduced vigor due to lower dynamic pressure gradients that partly drive the flow, resulting in a cooler mantle wedge. Along concave-arc-ward margins, the mantle inflow is deflected away from the region of lowest obliquity but with increased vigor, resulting in a hotter mantle wedge. These effects increase with decreasing radius of curvature. Along-margin change in the dip of the subducting slab also affects the inflow direction through its impact on the strike of the slab, but its effect is relatively small. We express the azimuthal inner angle between the inflow and outflow directions as a function of obliquity and apply the function to predict sub-arc mantle inflow directions in the circum-Pacific and neighboring regions. Within and among these margins, the inner angle varies over its full range of 0\u2013180\u00b0. Most of the margins that are 1000s of kilometers in length are either straight or curved concave-arc-ward with large radii of curvature, for which small or gradual along-margin changes in the mantle inflow direction and the mantle wedge temperature are predicted. A large drop in the mantle wedge temperature by up to a couple of hundred degrees is predicted at short convex-arc-ward segments, such as at the Kuril-Japan and Bonin-Mariana junctions. The fringes of flat slab segments are curved with small radii of curvature, likely resulting in sharp lateral changes in the inflow direction and the mantle wedge temperature.\n               ","25":"\n                  The traditional genetic algorithm and simulated annealing methods have been widely used in geophysical modeling. However, these nonlinear inversion methods require a lot of calculations, many control parameters and are unstable. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with black hole strategy (BH-PSO) is proposed to solve these problems. The comprehensive experiments show that the BH-PSO method consumes less time than the simulated annealing (SA) method and has a higher accuracy than the genetic algorithm (GA). It is more applicable to the inversion of parameters of volcanic magma chamber, and easier to be generalized to other kinematic source parameters inversion. Based on BH-PSO method, Sentinel-1 data, composite dislocation model (CDM), Yang model and Mogi model, the magma chamber parameters of Calbuco eruption in 2015 were retrieved. The results show that the RMSE of CDM model is 1.1 cm, which can better fit the surface deformation than the Mogi model and Yang model. The final results show that the magma chamber is located about 0.8 km northeast of the crater, about 9 km below the surface, and the total volume of the erupted volcanic material obtained with the CDM Model is of 0.209 km3, without considering dense rock equivalent.\n               ","26":"\n                  In Fennoscandia, tectonics, Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), and climatic changes cause ongoing crustal deformation of some millimetres per year, both vertically and horizontally. These displacements of the Earth can be measured to a high degree of precision using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Since about three decades, this is the major goal of the Baseline Inferences for Fennoscandian Rebound, Sea-level, and Tectonics (BIFROST) project.\n                  We present a new velocity field for an extended BIFROST GNSS network in the ITRF2008 reference frame making use of the GNSS processing package GPS Analysis Software of MIT (GAMIT). Compared to earlier publications, we have almost doubled the number of stations in our analysis and increased the observation time span, thereby avoiding the early years of the network with many instrument changes. We also provide modelled vertical deformation rates from contributing processes, i.e. elastic deformation due to global atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loading, ice mass and hydrological changes as well as GIA. These values for the vertical component can be used for removal of these contributions so that the residual uplift signal can be further analysed, e.g., in the context of local or regional deformation processes or large-scale but low-magnitude geodynamics.\n                  The velocity field has an uplift maximum of 10.3\u202fmm\/yr in northern Sweden west of the Gulf of Bothnia and subsidence exceeding 1\u202fmm\/yr in northern Central Europe. The horizontal velocity field is dominated by plate motion of more than 20.0\u202fmm\/yr from south-west to north-east. The elastic uplift signal sums up to 0.7\u20130.8\u202fmm\/yr for most stations in Northern Europe. Hence, the maximum uplift related to the past glaciation is ca. 9.6\u202fmm\/yr. The residual uplift signal after removal of the elastic and GIA contribution may point to possible improvements of the GIA model, but may also indicate regional tectonic and erosional processes as well as local deformation effects.

The other four provinces are in Libya, but all five provinces are from late Miocene to Quaternary and may have a common mantle source. The TVP, however, differs from the other four as regards volcano-tectonic processes, eruption style, and production of volcanic materials. The volcanic products of the TVP were erupted from the end of Miocene to late Pleistocene, range from basaltic to acidic, and suggest a double magma source \u2013 a shallow chamber fed by a deeper and larger reservoir. More specifically, field observations and numerical modelling results suggest that the basaltic magmas forming scoria cones, primarily at the periphery of the TVP, came from a deeper magma reservoir in the lower crust while the rhyolite and ignimbrites were fed by a shallow crustal magma chamber. By contrast, the volcanic products of the four volcanic provinces in Libya are primarily basalts and fed directly from single deep reservoirs. In the period from 8 Ma to 7\u22125 Ma, the evolution of the TVP was characterised by the formation of central volcanoes. Subsequently, in the period from 7\u22125 Ma to 0.43 Ma, the TVP was subject to caldera collapses that produced large-volume ignimbrites (>100 km3). Here we present numerical models with plausible loading conditions to understand better the volcano-tectonic evolution of the TVP and the spatial and temporal distribution of its major volcanic units. Our results suggest that the normal local stress field encouraged the formation of a central-volcano edifice (a volcanic cone) fed by radial dykes and inclined sheets and mostly erupting small volumes. By contrast, stress fields generated as a result of small crustal uplift or doming, due to the accumulation of magma in a deep-seated reservoir, triggered the formation of a ring-fault and the injection of a ring-dyke above the lateral margins of a shallow crustal magma chamber. Subsequently, the piston-like caldera subsidence helped to squeeze magma out of the shallow chamber resulting in large eruptions.\n               ","28":"\n                  We analyzed waveform inversion focal mechanisms of earthquakes that occurred in the last decades in the Calabrian Arc region, the most seismic area of Italy according to historical catalogs and the only where active subduction can be still found along the Nubia-Eurasia convergent margin. We focused our analysis on earthquakes shallower than 40 km and, in order to reduce the effects of very local scale processes, with magnitude 4.0 and larger. Hypocenters of the individual earthquakes with their uncertainties have been compared with location and geometry of the Calabrian Subduction Interface (CSI), reconstructed by previous investigators, with the purpose of associating the individual earthquakes and their focal mechanisms to the shallower part of the Ionian subducting plate (lower plate) or to the Tyrrhenian overriding plate (upper plate). By integrating focal mechanisms available from literature and catalogs with those properly estimated in this study we obtained a dataset of 31 focal mechanism solutions. Considering the focal depth of each earthquake and the CSI depth in the relative epicentral area, only one of the selected earthquakes could not be univocally associated to one of the two domains (lower or upper plate). The other 30 FMs show an evident west-east separation between the western earthquakes of the Tyrrhenian Sea and mainland Calabria occurring in the upper plate domain (17 earthquakes), and the eastern ones of the Calabria Ionian shore and relative offshore occurring in the lower plate domain (13 earthquakes). The focal mechanism distribution highlights clear extension in the Tyrrhenian overriding plate with opening direction trending roughly perpendicular to the Calabrian Arc mountain chain. The situation appears quite more complex in the Ionian lower plate where seismic faulting indicates marked heterogeneity with prevailing compressional features. These results are discussed together with the information available in the literature for the study area concerning historical earthquakes and relative sources, tectonic stress distributions, geodetic crustal velocities and related strain rates.

We performed a series of analogue modelling experiments of sequential subduction involving two seamounts of variable shape, spacing and rheological properties of strata to better understand the deformation mechanisms of an accretionary wedge with multi-seamount subduction. The results demonstrate that a seamount significantly hinders the seaward propagation of the accretionary wedge and facilitates lateral propagation. Two structural quiet zones form at the leading and trailing edges of the subducted seamount in the early stage of collision. As the seamount deeply penetrates into the wedge, the structural quiet zone in the leading edge is remoulded by a duplex structure, which may help the upward transport of deep subducted sediments back into the shallow area. Comparatively, the structural quiet zone in the trailing edge remains undeformed because it is situated in the stress shadow of the seamount. Deformation of the strata between two subducting seamounts may occur by thrusts laterally propagating into the seamount gap, which is facilitated by the d\u00e9collement layer.

Using geodynamic numerical models, we explored the internal deformation of the continental lithosphere during periods of tectonic quiescence taking into account lateral variations of lithospheric thickness. We observed that the orientation of lateral flow of the thick cratonic lithosphere depends primarily on the compositional density contrasts (\u0394\u03c1) between the asthenosphere and continental lithospheric mantle and on the width of the juxtaposed mobile belt lithosphere. In the case of mobile belts wider than 300 km, the margin of the thick craton flows towards (or underplates) the base of the thin lithosphere when \u0394\u03c1 \u2265 32\u221248 kg\/m3, whereas for smaller \u0394\u03c1 values, the thick cratonic margin flows away from mobile belt, preserving a sharp thickness variation. For mobile belts narrower than 300 km, the \u0394\u03c1 threshold between underplate or outward behavior decreases with the mobile belt width. Underplating of cratonic lithosphere beneath the thin lithosphere is efficient in mobile belts narrower than 300 km and for higher \u0394\u03c1, which allows them to cool, thicken and stiffen. Lateral flow of cratonic lithosphere is not efficient to underplate wide mobile belts thoroughly, so the latter are influenced by asthenospheric heat for prolonged periods and thus remain less rigid. Therefore, we propose that protracted tectonic quiescence of supercontinents can develop lithospheric rheological inheritances that may or may not facilitate post-quiescence continental lithospheric rifting.\n               ","36":"\n                  The Eurekan deformation is a partially contractional Cenozoic tectonic event that affected large parts of the Arctic region. In the study area on northern Ellesmere Island, major NE-SW trending strike-slip faults occur, which are related to the Eurekan deformation. The outcrop data show that left-lateral strike-slip kinematics slightly dominate, but also right-lateral kinematics were documented. Cross-cutting relationships of the individual faults give evidence for multiple fault reactivations within major strike-slip zones. The reconstructed paleostress fields show two phases. The first phase started with a N-S compression and shifted over a NNE-SSW compression into a NNW-SSE compression. The second phase was a WNW-ESE compression. The paleostress field evolution reflects the movements of Greenland. During the Eurekan phase 1, Greenland moved northward and during Eurekan phase 2 it moved to the WNW. These motions likely controlled the stress field on northern Ellesmere Island. From the paleostress field analyses and the orientation of the strike-slip faults in the study area, it can be derived that the Eurekan phase 1 deformation is characterized by left-lateral strike-slip faults, whereas most-likely during Eurekan phase 2 the majority of right-lateral strike-slip faults formed. The paleostress field analysis implies that many Eurekan faults are reactivated Ellesmerian faults. Recent seismic events indicate ongoing tectonic activity at some of the major strike-slip faults. This sheds new light on the geodynamics of northern Ellesmere Island, which was mechanically coupled to the Greenland plate, and implies that under the recent stress field, earthquakes at strike-slip faults are still possible and some of these faults were active in at least three phases over the last 350 Myr.\n               ","37":"\n                  Post-orogenic extension in back-arc regions is classically associated with metamorphic core complexes (MCCs) cored with exhumed metamorphic rocks and granitic intrusions interacting with low-angle detachments. When additional heat is provided by the advected asthenosphere below the extending region, for instance above slab tears, high-temperature migmatite-cored metamorphic domes and composite intrusions are emplaced whose geometry and kinematics of emplacement are controlled by regional extension and by detachments. The Cyclades Archipelago (Aegean Sea) hosts several such Miocene high-temperature MMCs intruded by Miocene granitoids, offering windows open on the interactions of intrusions with the Livada and Mykonos detachments, two branches of the North Cycladic Detachment System. Deformation associated with North Cycladic Detachment System has been described detailed on Mykonos based on a structural study of the deformation of the Mykonos pluton, but the high-temperature gneiss core of the MCC and the root zone of the intrusion have received little attention. Based on field surveys of the neighboring islands of Rheneia and Delos, we propose in this paper a new geological map and show that the locally migmatitic core of the MCC that extends from Rheneia to the Apollonia peninsula on Mykonos, is topped by a 500 m-thick low-angle shear zone, the Rheneia Shear Zone, coeval with the intrusion of a series of granitoids evolving from granodiorite to monzogranite. The Rheneia Shear Zone shows progressive flattening and shearing, with a constrictional component, during the intrusion of numerous fine-grained felsic dykes at various stages that are totally transposed to become parallel to the main regional foliation. The migmatitic core and the intrusion are intensely stretched with an E\u2013W trending lineation and folds with axes parallel to the lineation. Structural compatibility between the migmatites and the intrusion show that the rheological parameters were not much different at the time of intrusion. The same deformation continued during cooling of the dome while new batches of granitic material intruded the colder gneiss. The granites show syn-kinematic stretching at the magmatic stage and after cooling, leading to full homoaxiality between the magmatic fabric and the mylonites below the Livada and Mykonos Detachment. From the stage of lower crustal partial melting and subsequent intrusion to mylonitization and formation of the brittle Mykonos detachment, deposition of the supra-detachment Miocene sediments and the late intrusion of baryte-iron dykes, the same kinematics is observed until a change in the stress regime some 9 Ma ago. The Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia MCC illustrates the continuous interactions between a detachment system and a growing pluton and how a discrete magmatic event can be influenced by long-term tectonics.\n               ","38":"\n                  Seismic anisotropy of the upper mantle beneath the northwest Himalaya and eastern part of the Ladakh-Karakoram zone has been investigated using shear-wave splitting of core-mantle refracted SKS waveforms from 94 teleseismic earthquakes recorded at 28 broadband seismic stations. The SKS splitting parameters (\u03a6 and \u03b4t) show a significant strength of anisotropy with a wide range of delay time of split waves (\u223c0.75\u22122.94 s). The distinct variations in Fast Polarization Directions (FPDs) along the study section suggest a complex source of anisotropy that cannot be explained by a simple model. In the frontal part of the Himalaya, the FPDs are mostly parallel or sub-parallel to the strike of the Himalayan orogeny suggesting deformation in the shallow lithospheric mantle under compression owing to the India-Asia collision. On the other hand, FPDs observed in the Lesser, Higher, and Tethyan Himalaya largely follow NE-oriented absolute plate motion (APM) of the Indian plate which can be attributed to basal shear as the Indian plate moves over the asthenospheric mantle with a minor contribution from shallow lithospheric deformation. A complex anisotropy pattern is observed in the Indus Suture Zone. The FPDs near the Karakoram Fault Zone (KFZ) are parallel or sub-parallel to the strike of the KF. The strike-slip or transpressional deformation in the lithospheric mantle in the KFZ is considered as the major source of anisotropy beneath the KFZ. The study envisaged that the KF is a lithospheric scale fault that largely accommodates the India-Asia collision and extrusion in the Tibetan Plateau.\n               ","39":"\n                  The question of whether oroclines form by orogen-parallel buckling or orogen-perpendicular bending is a matter of debate. To address this problem, we conducted two-dimensional numerical models that investigate differences in the characteristics of oroclines caused by buckling, bending or a combination thereof. Our models consider a simple setup of a viscous layer embedded in a less viscous matrix and subjected to buckling and bending conditions. Models were run with varied layer thicknesses and viscosity contrasts. We applied a spectrum of deformation regimes, with pure buckling and pure bending as end members. Buckling models produced significant layer compression in inner fold hinges, whereas bending models produced widespread extension. Fold geometry also differed between buckling and bending models, as observed through relationships in fold amplitude, fold width, layer thickness, and interlimb angles. A comparison of the numerical results with three real-world examples (Kazakhstan, Gibraltar and Cantabrian oroclines) reveals significant similarities in geometrical features (particularly for the Kazakhstan and Gibraltar oroclines), and some discrepancies. The models show that geometric relationships, such as amplitude-width, thickness-width, thickening, and interlimb angles, provide limited information on the deformation. However, the distribution of stress across the fold hinge and limbs is a primary factor that might be used to understand whether oroclines formed by buckling or bending.\n               ","40":"\n                  The Encruzilhada Block lies between the eastern hinterland and western foreland of the Dom Feliciano Belt (southern Brazil) and its tectonic meaning in the orogenic evolution of the belt is still poorly understood. Its low magnetic signal is similar to that of the foreland supracrustal sequences, whereas the high gammaspectrometric signal appears due to the hinterland post-collisional granitoids. Satellite image lineament analysis points to tectonic similarities between the Encruzilhada Block and the foreland, as the structures in both domains show predominantly NNW and NNE trends, while the hinterland mostly presents NE-trending structures. The pre-orogenic connection between the Encruzilhada Block and the foreland is indicated by the correlation between the V\u00e1rzea do Capivarita and Cerro da \u00c1rvore complexes. Both contain 800 \u2013 780 Ma metaigneous rocks with arc-like geochemistry, and parametamorphic rocks with similar sedimentary provenance. Common syn-orogenic deformation history of both complexes is suggested by progressive to P-T o-th E-W transpressive deformation and similar peak metamorphic age (660 \u2013 640 Ma). PT-paths suggest exhumation of the hinterland V\u00e1rzea do Capivarita Complex from high-T\/low-P conditions of 790\u2013820 \u00b0C\/4.4\u20134.8 kbar to 660\u2013720 \u00b0C\/2.5\u20133.4 kbar at ca. 630 Ma. On the other hand, the foreland Cerro da \u00c1rvore Complex was subject to progressive metamorphism from 555 to 565 \u00b0C\/5.4\u20135.7 kbar to 560\u2013580 \u00b0C\/5.8\u20136.3 kbar, which is interpreted as a result of orogenic thickening. Evidence suggests that both complexes have originated in a similar, if not a single, basin on an attenuated lithosphere with high geothermal gradient, possibly a (back-arc?) rift. Oblique collision has caused basin inversion and thrusting of the lower crust over the rift margin, which may have been accompanied by lithosphere delamination. Progressive transpressional deformation and voluminous post-collisional magmatism (640 \u2013 578 Ma) controlled by major lineaments have blurred the original tectonic contact and finally caused thermal metamorphism in both complexes at ca. 3 kbar, when the autochthonous Encruzilhada Block was stabilized in its present geological configuration. The intracontinental character of major shear zones limiting hinterland and foreland requires a review of the existing evolutionary model for the Dom Feliciano Belt in the context of Western Gondwana amalgamation.\n               ","41":"\n                  One of the most significant parameters for seismic hazard assessment analyses is the fault slip rate. The combination of both geological (long-term) and geodetic (short-term) data offers a more complete characterization of the seismic potential of active faults. Moreover, geodetic data are also a helpful tool for the analysis of geodynamic processes. In this work, we present the results of a local GPS network from the Baza sub-Basin (SE Spain). This network, which includes six sites, was established in 2008 and has been observed for seven years. For the first time, we obtain short-term slip rates for the two active faults in this area. For the normal Baza Fault, we estimate slip rates ranging between 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr. For the strike-slip Galera Fault, we quantify the slip rate as 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr. Our GPS study shows a discrepancy for the Baza Fault between the short-term slip rates and previously reported long-term rates. This discrepancy indicates that the fault could be presently in a period with a displacement rate higher than the mean of the magnitude 6 seismic cycle. Moreover, the velocity vectors that we obtained also show the regional tectonic significance of the Baza Fault, as this structure accommodates one-third of the regional extension of the Central Betic Cordillera.\n                  Our GPS-related slip rates form the basis for future seismic hazard analysis in this area. Our results have further implications, as they indicate that the Baza and Galera Faults are kinematically coherent and they divide the Baza sub-Basin into two tectonic blocks. This points to a likely physical link between the Baza and Galera Faults; hence, a potential complex rupture involving both faults should be considered in future seismic hazard assessment studies.\n               ","42":"\n                  We examine the active stress field of the Southern Aegean Sea subduction area from fault plane solution data, focusing on the variability resulting from the application of different stress inversion methods. The study area is characterized by a high seismicity level and has been struck repeatedly by large destructive shallow and intermediate-depth earthquakes (up to M\u223c8.0). A larger number of previously published Fault Plane Solutions (FPS), as well as additional FPS computed in the framework of this study, provide the basis for the detailed study of the Southern Aegean active stress field. The active stress field is examined using three well-established algorithms, as well as an adapted method proposed in this study, based on the statistical processing of solutions provided by the Gephart and Forsyth (1984) method. The results obtained from all methods show a systematic consistency, with the Gephart and Forsyth method exhibiting the largest discrepancy, in comparison to other approaches. The determined active stress field reveals several domains with similar seismotectonic characteristics. Along the Southern Aegean (Hellenic) volcanic arc, the roughly North-South extension field shows an excellent correlation with the local arc geometry (arc-normal extension). The outer arc is characterized by compression, as a result of the active subduction, with an almost constant NE-SW direction. Between these two regions, a narrow zone with approximately East-West extension develops along the whole Hellenic Arc with subtle spatial differences, while in the eastern Hellenic Arc a well-developed strike-slip faulting pattern is recognized along the broader area of the Pliny and Strabo trenches. Finally, all intermediate-depth events show the same transpressional pattern, with a characteristic down-dip extension along the subduction direction and an arc-parallel compression, which follows the local arc orientation.\n               ","43":"\n                  We discuss the Cenozoic history of the Central Costa Rica forearc, between 10\u00b0 and 9\u00b030\u2032N, based on geological mapping, fault slip data and seismological records.The temporal variability in the regional stress-field suggests a variable and complex deformation pattern. The first stage of deformation, from the Paleogene to early Miocene, was controlled by an extensional regime in the forearc. Afterwards, a change to orthogonal convergence triggered a contractional deformation and subsequent inversion of the sedimentary extensional basins in the middle-upper Miocene. Finally, a transpressive regime has been developed since the Pliocene.\n               ","44":"\n                  The knowledge about spatial variation of stress field is an important step in the identification of geodynamic and seismotectonic characteristics. Inversion of focal mechanism solutions is one of the most common methods for determination of stress field and the shape ratio in a tectonic region. In this paper, Iterative Joint Inversion method is used to determine principal stress axes from earthquake focal mechanisms in the Zagros continental collision zone of Iran. In order to determine the influence of dependent events on the inversion results, the declustering process is carried out by the Urhammer's method. The area is divided into seven subzones according to the stress field heterogeneity in the Zagros region. In each subzone, the trends of principal stress axes, the orientation of maximum horizontal stress, stress regime and the shape ratio are determined. The results show that the compressional stress direction averages NNE-SSW that accord with the current convergence between the Arabian plate and Iranian micro-continent. A gradual counterclockwise rotation of the compressional axis is also concluded which is compatible with spatial changes in the Arabian\u2013Eurasian convergence paths along the Zagros. The stress regime of most of the subzones is deduced as the Transpression that reflects oblique convergence.

We utilized the Multiple Filter Automatic splitting Technique (MFAST) that allows quick processing of thousands of events and obtained a total of 3732 high-quality measurements. In general, the majority of fast directions follows a trend of NNE-SSW or NNW-SSE, while the average delay time was found equal to 0.149 s. Analysis of the percentage of anisotropy with hypocentral depth indicates that the interval between 5\u221220 km exhibits up to 6% of crustal anisotropy with the majority of values being smaller than 4%. Comparison of the observed fast shear wave directions with the maximum horizontal stress (Shmax) shows that stress-induced anisotropy can explain the fast directions along the forearc (Peloponnese, Kythira strait, eastern Crete, Kasos, Karpathos, Rhodes) and SW Turkey. In the Cyclades most fast directions are significantly different from Shmax. Structural anisotropy is dominant in southern Peloponnese, in some parts of Crete and Karpathos. In Cyclades fast directions at several stations agree well with the stretching lineations along the exhumed metamorphic core complex and some major fault zones. A comparison of fast shear wave directions of crustal anisotropy with those of SKS mantle anisotropy shows good agreement in the forearc (Peloponnese, eastern Crete, Karpathos, Rhodes) as well as SW Turkey and suggests that the crust is deforming in the same direction with the mantle flow. This pattern becomes less clear in the Cyclades where stations near the metamorphic core complex exhibit good agreement, while others exhibit large deviations between the two fast directions and point to a possible decoupling of the two lithospheric units.\n               ","46":"\n                  The Mesozoic Alkaline Magmatism on the South American Platform is related to the Gondwana breakup and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. This event, known as the Mesozoic Activation phase, was responsible for five magmatic pulses, among them the Late Cretaceous-Eocene Alkaline Magmatism, which implemented ten alkaline provinces, eight of which are in the south-central portion of Brazil. Some authors claim that the reactivation of old zones of weakness from the Precambrian basement, Brasiliano orogeny, may have been responsible for the structuring of few bodies in these provinces. This work used geophysical processing techniques to interpret magnetic and gravity data and 2.5 D forward modeling to contribute with the knowledge on the tectonic control over the Goi\u00e1s Alkaline Province. The geophysical data processing show a tectonic control over the Goi\u00e1s Alkaline Province, along the Brasiliano and Mesozoic structures, and there was no predominance of alkaline bodies along the Azimuth 125. We find that the Brasiliano orogeny structures limited the crustal block that contains this Province and Gondwana breakup possibly created and reactivated these structures. We discuss the continuity of large structures, at different depths, related to the Tocantins Province, mainly in the Bras\u00edlia belt, and some of them can be observed down to approximately 20 km depth. The forward gravity modeling beneath the Goi\u00e1s Alkaline Province shows a thicker crust and we propose that the primitive lithospheric mantle below this province was not altered during the Brasiliano orogeny stages, as in the adjacent crustal blocks, thus allowing for generation of alkaline rocks.

In this context, the analyzed Patagonian sector is associated with the subduction of a highly buoyant oceanic floor due to its relatively young age that contrasts with the ocean floor bathymetry to the north where oceanic crust gets progressively older up to the Eocene and consequently isostatically subsides. Short-term elastic deformational patterns associated with the earthquake cycle have been linked to this segmentation imposed by subducting fracture zones in previous works. Similarly, this work explores the relationship between long-term topography, seismicity, gravity, and magnetic anomalies as a proxy for upper crustal structure, deformation, exhumation, and consequently surface geology segmented nature associated with this pattern of oceanic fracture zones. Through these analyses, we have identified a series of ENE structural trends or lineaments across the continental crust that could be directly related to the segmented mechanical behavior of the plate interface and enhanced by particular climatic and tectonic history of the Patagonian region.

The earthquake was preceded by a seismic swarm on the upper southern-western sector of the volcano and by a short eruptive event in the summit area. The associated crustal deformation triggered seismic reactivation of tectonic structures in the eastern flank of the volcano.

Because no surface rupture associated with the earthquake has been reported, the causative fault of the earthquake is unknown. This event provides an opportunity to gain insight into the active tectonics of the region. Here, we acquire the coseismic deformation associated with this earthquake through Sentinel-1A interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and further invert the fault geometry and the detailed coseismic slip of this event based on the planar fault model. By a joint analysis of the inversion results, aftershocks sequence and local tectonics, we propose that the buried branch fault splaying from the Shalgun-Yelimsi fault (SYF) at depth may be responsible for this earthquake. Both the uniform and distributed slip models infer a smaller fault rupture size than predicted by classical fault scaling relation. We suggest that the subsurface fault geometry of the SYF may stop the rupture propagation further down to southeast at depth, thus resulting in high slip and stress drop at such a small fault plane. Considering the proximity of the epicenter to the SYF, we also invert for the distributed slip model on an anti-listric fault with the purpose to explore the possible complexity of rupture fault. However, due to the lack of obvious improvement to fit the observed data and the limited slip in the deep fault segment, the planar fault model is still regarded as the optimal one. According to the calculated coseismic Coulomb stress changes, we find that 55 % of aftershocks are triggered by the statics stress and that the northern segment of SYF and the eastern segment of SBF have a potential rupture risk. The occurrence of this earthquake, together with the prominent offset feature and slip style of surrounding active fault, indicates an active conjugate fault system, which may accommodate the small-scale northeastward lateral extrusion.\n               ","53":"\n                  The hierarchy of stress patterns at different evolution stages of the Central Baikal region has been studied by structural-genetic analysis of faults of different size ranks combined with other tectonophysical methods. Structural measurements were performed in the zones of the Primorsky, Olkhon, Prikhrebtovy, Buguldeika, and Kurtun faults that meet at the Buguldeika junction in the northwestern shore of Lake Baikal. Tectonic stress fields were reconstructed at the local, subregional, and regional levels in three largest fault zones (Primorsky, Olkhon, and Prikhrebtovy) and at the local and subregional levels in the smaller faults of Buguldeika and Kurtun. The stress settings in the area of the Buguldeika fault junction changed in the course of its tectonic history from Paleozoic-Mesozoic compression to Early Cenozoic strike-slip and finally to Late Cenozoic extension. The principal horizontal stress \u03c31 during the compression stage was oriented mainly in the NW and N\u2013S directions. The Mesozoic N\u2013S compression maintained northward propagation of imbricate thrusts from the Angara River headwaters as far as the Buguldeika area. The stage of strike-slip stress with N\u2013S \u03c31\u2009and W\u2013E \u03c33\u2009principal directions was reconstructed from structural measurements combined with slickenside data in the Primorsky fault zone and from slickenside data only in the Olkhon and Prikhrebtovy faults. The results show prolonged left-lateral strike-slip motions with large amounts of displacement in the Primorsky fault which delineates the Siberian craton margin. The Late Cenozoic extension stress setting has been modeled in terms of fan-like opening of large faults and clockwise rotation of upper crust blocks in the Central Baikal region.\n               ","54":"\n                  We discuss the geology, petrology, and major and trace element geochemistry of Late Cenozoic volcanic rocks in the Almaludag region in the Western Azerbaijan province, northwest Iran. Geology of this region evolved through the northward subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere and subsequent collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates during the Alpine-Himalayan orogeny. Two different Late Cenozoic periods of volcanic activity are recognized: Episode I produced pyroclastic deposits and trachydacitic lava (1.47 Ma, U-Pb dating) and Episode II generated mafic lava and scoria cones (including spatter\/cinder). Geochemical data indicate that Episode I lavas have high-silica adakitic compositions, similar to the post-collisional and continental adakites, that formed from the partial melting of the thickened lower crust. Episode II lavas vary in composition and fall into two distinct geochemical groups. The first group includes picrobasalt-basanite and tephrite compared to the more evolved trachybasalt and basaltic trachyandesite of the second group. Both of these groups show alkaline to shoshonitic affinities.\n                  The binary geochemical plots of the Episode II samples display compositional trends that indicate magmatic processes such as fractional olivine \u00b1 clinopyroxene crystallization. The major and minor elemental variations of these samples reflect a mantle source heterogeneity and minor crustal contamination. The REE (rare earth elements) patterns and spider diagrams indicate enrichment of the large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and depletion of the high field strength elements (HFSE) relative to the heavy rare earth elements (HREE), and reveal an enriched lithospheric mantle source which was previously metasomatized by subduction components. The mantle source of the Episode II lavas was enriched by fluids and melts which were released from a subducted slab between Late Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic in northwest Iran. The Si-undersaturated lavas of the first group of Episode II probably originated in the garnet stability field in the lithospheric mantle with carbonate residue or veins, suggesting that the mantle source probably underwent carbonate metasomatism. Geochemistry of the SiO2 rich lavas of the second group of Episode II is consistent with a melt extracted from a peridotitic mantle source. The compositional variation from the rocks of the first group to those in the second group suggests a diminishing degree of metasomatic veins-wallrock interactions.\n                  The Late Cenozoic mafic rocks in the Almaludag region probably formed through extension in a post-collision, post-orogenic setting. The extension was likely the result of the delamination of the thickened subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) and ensuing asthenospheric upwelling after the collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates.\n               ","55":"\n                  Intensive physical\/chemical changes take place in earthquake preparation zone prior to major earthquake events. These changes result in anomalous variations of atmospheric parameters. In this study, anomalous variations of Surface Latent Heat Flux (SLHF) and Air Temperature (AT) are investigated prior to 17 major earthquake events with magnitude \u2265 5.3 Mw in active tectonic regions of the world for the period from 2004 to 2020 using InterQuartile Range (IQR) and Hierarchical Clustering (HC) statistical techniques. Studied earthquakes are selected from subduction, transform and intraplate locations. The results clearly show anomalous variations in the SLHF and AT atmospheric parameters few days to few weeks prior to the occurrence of the earthquake event. The Honshu earthquake event is captured 54 days prior to the event using SLHF data, whereas Bella Bella earthquake event is observed 39 days prior to the event using AT data. Best anomalies using both SLHF and AT are identified for Pasni and Norcia earthquake events, whereas lowest anomalies using both SLHF and AT are identified for Nsunga and Puerto Quellon events. The anomalous variations of SLHF and AT prior to the earthquake event show a definite precursor pattern. Strong anomalies are observed in subduction\/thrust regime whereas, minimum to moderate anomalies are observed along strike slip faults. This study determined the threshold values of 59.52 W\/m2 and 2.87 K for SLHF and AT respectively. The HC revealed more than 70 % similarity among earthquakes based on depth, magnitude, SLHF and AT. Mechanism of energy exchange between lithosphere and atmosphere can be understood by analyzing significant rise in SLHF and AT. It is essential to monitor these variations continuously to properly identify earthquake related anomalies.\n               ","56":"\n                  Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), or postglacial rebound refers to the crustal response to glacial loading and unloading processes. In this investigation, we run numerical simulations using different rheological parameters and ice loading histories to obtain models of the glacial isostatic response for the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The objective is to assess in general the potential impact of GIA on hydrocarbon reservoirs and trapping structures in terms of tilting, deformation, fault activity or geochemical implications on the trapped fluids. Comparisons may be drawn to related studies, including analogous impacts on reservoirs in the Barents Sea, as well as validation of GIA model predictions of vertical crustal motion using GNSS stations, levelling networks and relative sea level (RSL) observations at numerous sites across eastern Canada. By running a series of GIA models, a range of vertical motion rates are output through time to determine displacement amounts, and calculations are performed on these outputs to disseminate other valuable data attributes such as the displacement gradient and differences in time and space. In general, the vertical motion rate is seen to change drastically over time for certain points, as the lag in response of regions near the ice periphery leads to a distinct pattern of uplift and subsidence. The Grand Banks generally experienced between 57 m of subsidence to 34 m of uplift since the last glacial maximum, depending on the specific location and the GIA model parameters. At the reservoir scale, model results along a 10 km baseline show up to \u22121.0\u20131.5 m of differential vertical displacement, which could have led to reservoir tilting or even hydrocarbon migration. As a result of this study, it is clear that there are implications of GIA on hydrocarbon reservoirs since the Last Glacial Maximum, and these effects are ongoing.\n               ","57":"\n                  In this study, the gravity changes observed by GRACE satellites along with the deformation field determined from GPS velocity vectors are used to estimate the fault parameters of 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake (SAE) by the inversion of PSGRN\/PSCMP dislocation model. To do so, the co-seismic gravity changes are determined by fitting a time-series function to the GRACE monthly gravity fields and the effects of hydrology are suppressed with the aid of Global Land Data Assimilation (GLDAS) model. To increase the accuracy of inversion process, the GPS observed co-seismic and post-seismic displacements from 90 stations scattered across the deformed area are also used to constrain the inversion algorithm.\n                  The inversion is performed via the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that minimizes the error between the model-predicted and observed deformation and gravity changes. To this end, the PSGRN\/PSMCP dislocation model predicts the deformation and gravity changes for each candidate fault in the PSO iterative process. It is shown that the joint use of the GPS and GRACE data in determination of focal mechanism, results in a fault model that is better consistent with the geometry of the existing subduction zone compared to the inverted fault using only GPS or GRACE data. Due to the complex geometry of the Sunda Trench, a discretized rectangular fault system is considered that allows the depth, slip, strike angle and dip angle vary between the sub-faults. In fact, the estimated fault model consists of 100 sub-faults with a total moment magnitude of Mw = 9.23 that matches the curved geometry of the Sunda Trench. The fault model reveals that the slip has a greater magnitude in segments near the northern Sumatra and Nicobar islands while for the segments of the fault, near the Andaman Islands, the slip is relatively smaller and has its greater magnitudes at depth. The depths and dip angles of the estimated fault model are compared to the SLAB2 3D geometry provided for the Sumatra and Java subduction zones and through this comparison, the RMSEs of 6.0\u2009km for the depth and 3.1\u2009\u00b0 for the dip angle are obtained.\n               ","58":"\n                  Structural inversion of strike\u2013slip faults in response to plate kinematic changes and interactions of large\u2013scale basement blocks is a significant phenomenon in continental collision zones. In the Alborz Mountains, at the northern margin of the Iranian Plateau, Late Cenozoic kinematic of major fault systems changed in the late Pliocene from dextral to sinistral strike\u2013slip. This kinematic change has been attributed to the clockwise rotation of the rigid South Caspian Block. However, the spatial extent and distribution of this kinematic change toward the south and into the Iranian Plateau is controversial. Here we present a detailed structural analysis of the West Saveh fault system located at the northwestern margin of the Iranian Plateau to unravel the regional distribution of this kinematic change. The West Saveh fault system is composed of the WNW\u2013ESE trending Kushk\u2013e Nosrat, Khalkhab, Saveh, and Nashveh faults. We identified several different sets of strike\u2013slip related structures, which are classified into three categories based on their cross\u2013cutting relationship and superimposition of kinematic indicators. We document dextral, dextral transpression and sinistral kinematics and their relative timing since Miocene time in the West Saveh fault system. Our structural analysis indicates recent slip sense inversion from dextral transpression to sinistral strike\u2013slip, which possibly occurred in post Pliocene time. This kinematic change is regional and can be explained by the clockwise rotation of the South Caspian Block similarly to the kinematic change documented in the Alborz Mountains. We propose that the kinematic change due to South Caspian Block rotation is not restricted to the Alborz Mountains, but also affected the Iranian Plateau during post Pliocene time.\n               ","59":"\n                  The detection of earthquake (EQ) related ionospheric anomalies using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has emerged as a convincing approach and new field in the search for seismic precursors. Total Electron Content (TEC) from International GNSS Services (IGS) network may help to distinguish seismo ionospheric anomalies from geomagnetic storm induced anomalies. In this paper, spatial and temporal TEC anomalies are investigated in 1 s resolution data from GNSS stations around the epicenter of the August 19, 2018, Fiji EQ (M\n                        w\n                      8.2). Moreover, median and standard deviation based anomaly detection techniques are implemented on TEC and the variations are quantified on the basis of z-test at \u03b1 = 0.05 significance level. We find evidence of significant ionospheric anomalies of low intensity within 5\u201310 days before and 5 days after the main shock by estimating TEC from four GNSS stations within the EQ preparation period. On the other hand, a significant ionospheric anomaly of high intensity arises after the main shock beyond 5 days (+7 day and onward) after the EQ, which is associated with an intense geomagnetic storm (Dst <-150 nT and Kp \u2265 7). More analysis reveals that EQ induced TEC anomalies are significant during Local Time (LT) = 08:00\u221216:00 (for Fiji, LT= UT+12) and similarly the storm (Dst =-150 nT and Kp \u2265 7) induced TEC anomaly prevails in all GNSS stations during LT= 08:00\u221218:00. The TEC intensity of the storm anomaly is more substantial in all four GNSS stations compared to the EQ induced TEC anomaly. All these anomalies before and after the main shock during the EQ preparation period are advantageous towards differentiating seismic versus geomagnetic storm anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis aids in the developing hypothesis of lithosphere ionosphere coupling through TEC monitoring.\n               ","60":"\n                  The late Early Paleozoic volcanic rocks in the East Kunlun orogen are crucial to determining collisional processes related to the evolution of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. We report new zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotopes from these volcanic rocks and constrain their tectonic setting and magmatic processes. This volcanic suite consists mainly of foliated metarhyolites and minor metabasalts. Zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the bimodal volcanic rocks formed from Late Silurian to Early Devonian (ca. 420\u2212409 Ma). The basalts show tholeiitic geochemical signatures characterized by low contents of SiO2 (47.19\u201354.83 %), MgO (2.21\u20137.52 %), and K2O\/Na2O ratios (0.32\u22120.77%) and high contents of TiO2 (1.80\u20132.91 %). Their chondrite-normalized REE patterns are characterized by enrichments in LREEs (LREE\/HREE = 3.68\u20136.09) with slight Eu anomalies (\u03b4Eu = 0.67\u20131.00); their patterns are similar to the reference line of oceanic island basalt (OIB). The primitive mantle-normalized trace element diagram also shows similarities with OIBs and features overall enrichments in large ion lithophile and high field strength elements, except for Nb and Ta. The \u03b5\n                     Nd(t = 422 Ma) values range narrowly from \u22121.79 to +1.32. These features suggest that the basalts were most likely derived from an asthenospheric mantle that was contaminated by small volumes of subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM)\/crust. The variations in major and trace elements show that the basalts experienced fractional crystallization of olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase. In contrast, the metarhyolites have high SiO2 (65.85\u201370.83 %), Na2O + K2O (6.71\u201310.09 %), K2O\/Na2O ratios (1.69\u20132.80 %) and low MgO, Ni, and Cr contents. Their trace element signatures show enrichments in LILEs and LREEs (e.g. Cs, Rb, Ba), depletion of HFSEs (e.g. Nb, Ti, Ta) and high negative Eu anomalies. These features suggest a crustal origin lacking interactions with mantle melts. Considering all the geochemical and tectonic events of this area, it is concluded that the Maoniushan Formation volcanic rocks in EKOB formed in a postcollisional extensional setting related to asthenospheric mantle upwelling and continental delamination processes during the Late Silurian to Early Devonian. These tectonic-magmatic events, together with previous data, suggest that the Proto-Tethys Ocean had closed and evolved to postcollisional collapse stage since the Late Silurian.\n               ","61":"\n                  Nearly 20 years after the M\n                     w = 6.0 Athens (Greece) earthquake of 7 September 1999, a significant M\n                     w = 5.1 event struck on 19 July 2019 in roughly the same epicentral region, south of Mt Parnitha, \u223c20 km NW of the Athens metropolitan area. In this work, we present a seismotectonic study of the 2019 sequence and investigate its relation with the 1999 aftershock zone and fault geometry. We also take advantage of this opportunity to re-examine the 1999 sequence, using modern cross-correlation and double-difference relocation tools. Waveforms recorded by stations of temporary local networks that were installed at a common site in both case studies are taken into account to identify strongly correlated earthquakes, in terms of waveform similarity, that may indicate a significant degree of resemblance in their source parameters. Our results indicate that the 2019 sequence partially overlaps the western segment of the 1999 aftershock zone. A spatial gap in the middle of that zone, attributed to a high coseismic slip patch during the 1999 mainshock, is still present in 2019, while an isolated cluster of the eastern segment was also reactivated. The relocated hypocenters of both sequences are distributed on nearly coinciding planes that strike \u223cN113\u00b0-118 \u00b0E and dip 48\u221255\u00b0 towards SSW, apparently offset by 1\u22122 km at seismogenic depths, though this difference is attributed to location biases. Their updip extensions outcrop at Mt Parnitha, 1\u22123 km north of the mapped Fili fault segments or their westwards extension. The 2019 sequence is considered to have occurred at the same structure as the western group of the 1999 aftershocks, which is likely a blind fault.\n               ","62":"\n                  Widespread heterogeneities exist in the continental lithosphere, but their role in continental rifting is poorly understood. Here we investigate the influence of lithospheric heterogeneities on the pattern of continental rifting using 2D thermo-mechanical simulations. The heterogeneities are mainly manifest in a laterally inhomogeneous continental lithosphere, which has a cold west (CW) half and a hot east (HE) half. A series of experiments were performed to examine the effects of lithospheric thermal state, weak zones, and extension velocity on continental rifting. The results show that: (1) stretching of a CWHE lithosphere always leads to the formation of a wide rift at the HE side, while the CW side remains largely undeformed; (2) the presence of a weak zone in the CW lithosphere can cause a wide rift to form at the eastern side and a deep narrow rift to form synchronously at the western side; and (3) the lithospheric thermal state strongly affects the style of rifting and the lithospheric deformation mode. When the crust is extremely hot (TMoho\n                      = 900 \u2103), a wide rift first develops at the HE side, which is followed by the formation of a narrow rift at the CW side. The extension velocity mainly affects the timing of rift formation but has no significant effect on the style of rifting. A number of rift basins have developed in the North China Craton (NCC) since the early Cenozoic in response to the retreat of the Pacific plate subduction. The eastern NCC is dominated by wide rifts, whereas the western NCC is dominated by narrow rifts. We suggest that the coexistence of these two types of rift in the NCC is the result of lateral lithospheric heterogeneities, which include pre-existing lithospheric weaknesses. The differences in the thermal and rheological states between the Eastern Block and Western Block of the NCC prior to extension were likely to cause the wide rifts at the east and the narrow rifts at the west.\n               ","63":"\n                  Inversion of the coseismic slip distribution is important for understanding seismogenic mechanisms. In this study, the geometric parametersand uncertainties for the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal were inverted using a Bayesian approach. The coseismic fault slip distribution was inverted based on triangular dislocations from interferometrc synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) surface displacement measurements.

The Volsci Volcanic Field is characterized by phreatomagmatic surge deposits, rich in accidental carbonate lithics, and subordinate Strombolian scoria fall deposits and lava flows, locally sourced from some tens of monogenetic eruptive centers (at least fifty tuff rings and scoria cones). We investigate the subsurface maar-diatreme processes in terms of relationships between faulting and explosive magma-water interaction, as well as the distribution pattern of the eruptive centers. With this aim, we present the following new data: i) description of the fold-and-thrust belt structure and associated eruptive centers, ii) componentry of volcanic rock-types, iii) determination of grain-size, degrees of whiteness and roundness of carbonate lithic inclusions, iv) micropaleontological analysis of carbonate lithics. We show that the clustering of eruptive centers is controlled by tectonic features. A first order control is tentatively related to crustal laceration and deep magma injection along a ENE-trending Quaternary lateral tear in the slab and to Mesozoic rift-related normal faults. A second-order control is provided by orogenic structures (mainly thrust and extensional faults). In particular, magma-water explosive interaction occurred at multiple levels (< 2.3 km depth), depending on the structural and hydrogeologic setting of the Albian-Cenomanian carbonates, which are intersected by high-angle faults. The progressive comminution, rounding and whitening of entrained carbonate lithics allow us to trace multistage diatreme processes.

To better understand the tectonic process, 61 broadband magnetotelluric (MT) stations were acquired in Central\/Western Hoggar to image the underlying lithosphere. We performed 2-D and 3-D inversions of the impedance tensor and the vertical magnetic field transfer function using data from three profiles. The resistive crust is interrupted by several conductors related to the known shear zones of the area. Some conductors can be associated with Cretaceous-Cenozoic fluid flow combined with mineralization (graphite, magnetite or more locally gold). MT models suggest three distinct blocks. (1) An oriental block composed of Tefedest, Laouni, Aouil\u00e8ne and Silet juvenile terrane characterized by a moderately conductive lithospheric mantle (LM). (2) A central block formed by the In Ted\u00ebini and Tin Zaouatene terranes, previously considered as Neoproterozoic juvenile, exhibit resistive characteristics typical of an old continental LM. Finally, (3) an occidental block corresponding to the In Ouzzal terrane with a highly conductive LM. The oriental and occidental blocks were strongly remobilized during the Neoproterozoic, and perhaps even locally during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The main shear zones of the study area are (1) the Iskel shear zone, a major suture zone separating the oriental and central blocks. The MT model suggests that the geometry of this lithospheric shear zone is characterized by an eastward dipping angle, according to the central block a passive margin character where Silet arc was accreted. Consequently, east from Silet a collision with the oriental block may have been in an active margin environment. (2) The Adrar fault and the West Ouzzalian shear zone correspond to terrane boundaries of the In Ouzzal. They are associated with deep-reaching high conductivity, consistent with large scale suture zones. The resistivity models provide new geometric constraints for the terranes and highlight new Pan-African and Phanerozoic tectonic features.\n               ","66":"\n                  Archean to Paleoproterozoic rocks potentially record the evolution of the geodynamo and the tectonic mode of the early Earth. The paleomagnetic intensity and direction data provide important information on the Earth\u2019s core\u2013mantle revolution. Herein, we report the results of paleomagnetic and geochronological studies of a Proterozoic dolerite dyke from southern West Greenland. Clinopyroxene grains from the dyke yielded Ar\u2013Ar plateau ages from 1808 to 1887 Ma (1816.0 \u00b1 14.6 Ma; 2\u03c3). The paleomagnetic direction of the dyke (D = 243.6\u00b0, I = 66.3\u00b0, \u03b195 = 3.9\u00b0) yielded a virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) of 33.5 \u00b0N and 96.4 \u00b0W. This 1.8 Ga pole falls in a limited area where Paleoproterozoic poles between 2.5 Ga and 1.7 Ga for southern West Greenland are distributed. Comparison of the Paleoproterozoic poles of southern West Greenland with those of North America suggests that the North Atlantic Craton of southern Greenland could have been an independent stagnant tectonic block, different from the drifting Superior and Slave Cratons in the Early Proterozoic. Thellier experiments on 13 specimens yielded a mean paleointensity value of 14.8 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcT, indicating a virtual dipole moment of 2.88 \u00b1 0.46 \u00d7 1022 Am2. This value is approximately one-third of the present-day Earth's field intensity, and is consistent with the value for the period between 1400 Ma and 2400 Ma. This small paleointensity value of the Proterozoic rocks is due to a gradual dipole moment change over a long period (\u223c1 Gyrs) since 4000 Ma.\n               ","67":"\n                  Retroarc foreland basins are important archives of continental arc magmatism and upper plate deformational processes that control the evolution of continental lithosphere. However, resolving source areas in foreland basin infill dominated from mixed mafic and recycled sediment using conventional methods such as detrital zircon geochronology poses a challenge to thorough analysis due to lower zircon fertility and the higher susceptibility to weathering of mafic lithologies. Here, we integrate whole rock 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology and major and trace element geochemistry data from volcanic clasts from the lower Miocene infill of the Magallanes-Austral Basin and local Sierra Baguales intrusive rocks to understand the distribution of mafic sources and Neogene changes in arc magmatism in between multiple ridge subduction events in the southern Patagonian Andes. Potential source areas for the coarse-grained mafic detritus include the Eocene plateau lavas, the Late Jurassic-Miocene Southern Patagonian batholith, and the Late Jurassic Sarmiento Ophiolitic Complex. Published detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra suggest that all three sources are viable contributors to the basin, though the paucity of Jurassic and Eocene zircons preclude these as major sources. Here, new 40Ar\/39Ar dating of the volcanic clasts from the early Miocene R\u00edo Guillermo Formation reveals latest Oligocene to early Miocene eruptive ages (\u223c25-22 Ma), indicating syndepositional eruption with the ancestral R\u00edo Guillermo fluvial sedimentation. A single dated clast yields a Late Cretaceous age (\u223c102 Ma). The clasts are dominantly basaltic andesite with Ba\/Ta \u223c500-1000, La\/Ta >20, and Ba\/La >15, indicating an arc-derived melt source. We propose that the clasts record a Miocene mafic continental arc source area in the Patagonian Andes, which has since been removed by erosion and is thus sparsely represented in the batholith. Furthermore, we suggest that this early Miocene phase of arc volcanism, which postdates Eocene and Oligocene backarc magmatism and pre-dates middle Miocene to recent Chile Ridge backarc magmatism, reflects a return to normal arc volcanism along the Patagonian margin following a cessation due to ridge subduction and subsequent slab window migration. New geochemistry and 40Ar\/39Ar data from a basaltic dike in the Sierra Baguales, which crosscuts the Cenozoic stratigraphic section, records plateau magmatism \u223c16 Ma associated with incipient Chile Ridge slab window volcanism.\n               ","68":"\n                  The Yangtianba Formation in the northwestern Bikou Terrane preserves sedimentary archives for the Early to Middle Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of the northwestern margin of the Yangtze Block (YB). However, its provenance and depositional mechanism are still matter of debates. This paper presents geochronological and petrographic studies of two granite gravel samples and one coarse-grained sandstone sample as well as facies analysis of the conspicuous Yangtianba Formation conglomerates (YFC). The weighted average 206Pb\/238U ages of the two granite gravels are 743 \u00b1 6 Ma and 762 \u00b1 4 Ma, respectively. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages of the sandstone sample peak at ca. 880 to 740 Ma, close to the depositional age of the Yangtianba Formation. Together with the dominantly angular to subangular morphology and clear oscillatory or broad zoning of these detrital zircons, the Yangtianba Formation is likely sourced from the Early to Middle Neoproterozoic igneous rocks. Facies analysis of the YFC shows they are stacked bundles of fining- and thinning-upward units of conglomerates-sandstone, suggesting a decreasing supply of coarse clastic materials from the episodic mass flow (debris flow) in the submarine channels rather than tillites. Combining with the previous work, the Yangtianba Formation probably mainly sourced from the Neoproterozoic igneous rocks in the Micangshan-Hannan area in the northwestern margin of the YB and is subaqueous sediment gravity flow deposits rather than glacial-marine deposits. These findings favor the model that the northwestern margin of the YB may be an active continental margin setting during the Early- to Middle- Neoproterozoic (ca. 835 to 720 Ma).\n               ","69":"\n                  The composite dikes of the Zimbros Bay in the Porto Belo-Bombinhas region, southern Brazil, are emplaced in the late stages of post-collisional magmatism, at ca. 590 Ma as NE-striking, subvertical tabular bodies intrusive in basement orthogneisses. The composite dikes are formed by a felsic core containing a swarm of mafic microgranular enclaves, bordered on both sides by mafic material of irregular thickness, and individual mafic dikes parallel to the main intrusion. The felsic and mafic rocks contain a well-developed magmatic foliation with solid-state deformation near the contacts. Stretching lineation is horizontal to sub-horizontal and better developed in the felsic rocks. The absence of a well-developed linear fabric in the mafic rocks hinders investigation of their emplacement based on conventional structural data. In order to investigate\/explore the relationship between contemporaneous mafic and felsic rocks, as well as to understand the emplacement of these intrusions in relation to the transcurrent tectonics, a study on the magnetic fabric was made using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and rock magnetism techniques for composite and individual mafic dikes. Magnetic mineralogy of both dikes is predominantly controlled by ferromagnetic minerals (e.g. magnetite and Ti-poor tinanomagnetite), with little contribution of paramagnetic minerals. The rock magnetism study shows that the magnetite grains have varied sizes. Individual mafic dikes have small grain sizes, whilst in the mafic borders, sizes vary from small to large. Felsic cores have large grain sizes. SEM data show oxyexsolution textures in the felsic core samples and in samples of individual mafic dikes. Only Ilmenite is found in the mafic border samples, either as anhedral grains or as thin lamellae, interpreted to result from intense oxyexsolution of magnetite. Increasing oxyexsolution degrees observed in samples from individual mafic dikes to felsic cores and mafic borders suggest different degrees of interaction between the original magmas. The studied intrusions show normal magnetic fabrics, with subvertical magnetic foliation (k1-k2 plane) and subhorizontal (k1) lineation. Magnetic data are concordant with structural field measurements and indicate sub-horizontal magma flow during emplacement. The much larger volume and size of enclaves found in the southern portion of the dike is compatible with its northward directed emplacement. The obtained magnetic data are also in agreement with the syntectonic emplacement of the composite dikes relative to the transcurrent movement of the Major Gercino Shear Zone.\n               ","70":"\n                  GOCE satellite mission enabled us to produce a dramatic improvement in the ability to measure the ocean\u2019s mean dynamic topography (MDT). To promote the application of the new geodetic MDT, it is essential to estimate its error quantitatively. Motivated by this requirement, we carefully assessed the formal error of geodetic MDT based on the classical error propagation law across each harmonic degree and order (D\/O) which corresponds to different spatial scale. In the processes above, we presented an efficient method by introducing Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) for computation, by which the challenge of high computation load in formal error estimation across each cutoff D\/O was overcome. It was found that the MDT formal errors were mainly dominated by geoid formal error across high cutoff D\/O. Across low D\/O the mean sea surface (MSS) formal error was primarily responsible for the MDT formal error. At the global scale (70 \u00b0S-70 \u00b0N), the geoid and MSS made similar contributions (0.27 cm) to the MDT formal error (0.38 cm) with a cutoff D\/O of 120, corresponding to spatial resolution of 167 km; With a cutoff D\/O of 100, 200, and 280, the MDT formal errors were approximately 0.32 cm, 2.0 cm, and 12.5 cm, respectively.\n               ","71":"\n                  We present a joint analysis of seismological and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data of the seismic sequence that started on October 25, 2018 with a shallow Mw\u202f=\u202f6.7 earthquake offshore Zakynthos (Ionian Sea, Greece). The inversion of the GNSS data shows the activation of a N-S striking thrust\/oblique-slip fault at the African-Aegean plate interface with a length of \u223c26\u202fkm, and depth shallower than 15\u202fkm. The fault-plane geometry is well constrained by GNSS with a low-dip angle (23\u00b0), and dip-direction towards east. This is consistent with the distribution of the relocated aftershocks (1811 events). Our analysis indicates that the October 25, 2018 event ruptured the Hellenic megathrust. This event highlights the high degree of seismic coupling in the western region of the Hellenic Arc. It also highlights the \u201cstrong\u201d nature of the subducting slab with the occurrence of \u201clocked\u201d patches under the Ionian seafloor that fail during large, reverse\/oblique-slip earthquakes. The latest, shallow seismic events of the western Hellenic arc (1976 Zakynthos, 1997 Strofades, 2018 Zakynthos) point to a sequence of low-angle events along the plate interface with most of co-seismic deformation taken up by the upper (Aegean) plate. The GNSS data also point to a similar pattern between the co-seismic strain release and the long-term (interseismic) strain accumulation along the west Hellenic Arc.\n               ","72":"\n                  The analysis of post-seismic fault relocking and healing is crucial for predicting future seismic risk in seismogenic regions.

Analysis was performed using Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity data for the periods 2009\u20132011, 2011\u20132013, 2013\u20132015, and 2015\u20132018, combined with cross-fault levelling data from 2008 to 2017. The results show that following short-term creep caused by the Wenchuan earthquake, the northeastern section of the LFZ rapidly began relocking process, and that today, the fault plane is close to being fully coupled; following the subsequent 2013 M\n                     w6.6 Lushan earthquake, coupling fraction along part of the middle section of the LFZ, southwest of the Wenchuan earthquake source, gradually increased, which are basically consistent with fault healing results indicated by permeability and seismic wave velocity. The Wenchuan earthquake also accelerated strain accumulation rates and enhanced coupling along the southwestern section of the LFZ. Following the Lushan earthquake, only local areas of the southwestern section were decoupled, limiting the release of accumulated strain energy. The aftershock gap between the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes, and the aftershock gap southwest of the Lushan earthquake remain strongly coupled and continue to accumulate strain energy; as such, seismic risk remains high in these two segments.\n               ","73":"\n                  The Bras\u00edlia Belt in southern Brazil is a Neoproterozoic orogenic belt that represents the northern border of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, a long-lived early Paleozoic intracratonic basin. The belt is surrounded by cratonic domains and were modestly affected and reactivated by the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean during the Cretaceous.

The apatite fission track central ages range from 386 to 243 Ma and the mean track lengths range between 13.4 and 14.5 \u03bcm. Thermal history modeling reveals Devonian to Permian cooling, which we interpret as the main final exhumation of the Bras\u00edlia Belt, implying that indeed the influence of posterior Mesozoic and Cenozoic geodynamic history on the belt was limited. The Paran\u00e1 Basin and surrounding elevated terranes therefore provide a time window to study the tectonic history of Gondwana and the effect of far-field intraplate stresses on the interior of West Gondwana. Rapid basement exhumation of the Bras\u00edlia Belt is coeval with extension and tectonic subsidence in the Paran\u00e1 Basin as a result of continent-scale tectonic forces occurring over entire West Gondwana.\n               ","74":"\n                  The January 23, 2018 M7.9 earthquake ruptured conjugate set of strike-slip faults in the outer rise of the Alaska subduction zone, southeast of Kodiak Island.

Here, we suggest that this earthquake occurred as a result of two different modes of interaction process.

In this study, we present geochemical characteristics of magmatic apatites from the Luming and Lower Yangtze granitic belts of NE and eastern China to explore their potential in petrogenesis, mineralization and tectonic evolution of granites. The petrogenetic, metallogenic and tectonic aspects of these granites remain subjects of great debate. This review aims to clarify these issues based on apatite geochemistry. The investigated apatites from both these localities are mainly fluorapatites reflecting the actual attributes of parental melts. Apatites from Luming and Lower Yangtze River Belt (LYRB) exhibit strong negative Eu anomalies suggesting plagioclase crystallization earlier than apatite. The negative correlation of Eu\/Eu* (\u03b4Eu) vs Mn, \u03b4Eu vs \u03b4Ce and \u03b4Eu vs Ga in the apatites signifies that the parental magmas of both granites are produced under moderate reduced conditions. The Sr contents and REEs ratios in apatites serve as significant proxies to trace the differentiation history of Luming and Lower Yangtze granitic plutons. The apatites Sr\/Y ratios vs \u03b4Eu also exhibit that both granites are non-adakitic in nature which is consistent with the host rocks non-adakitic affinities. Halogen data indicates that apatites of Lower Yangtze comprising more chlorine (0.02\u20131.45\u202fwt.%) and less fluorine (1.51\u20133.85\u202fwt.%) are linked with slab dehydration whereas apatites from Luming having lower Cl (0\u20130.04\u202fwt.%) and higher F contents (3.36\u20135.29\u202fwt.%) suggest association of granites with partial melting of juvenile crust material. Based on the positive correlation of SO3 with Li, (La\/Sm)N vs (Yb\/Sm)N and obvious variations of (La\/Yb)N vs Eu\/Eu*, it is inferred that these host rocks are ore-associated. Furthermore, geochemical signatures of apatites from LYRB show low F\/Cl ratios, stable La\/Sm ratios, high \u03b4Eu (0.04\u20130.43, average 0.21) and low \u03b4Ce values (0.96\u20131.12, average 1.02) indicating that the magmas of these granites have association with slab dehydration and linked with Cu\u2013Mo\u2013W mineralization, induced from the mutual impacts of Paleo-Pacific plate subduction and intraplate extension. In comparison, fairly high F\/Cl ratios, La\/Sm ratios, low \u03b4Eu (0.12\u20130.23, average 0.16), high \u03b4Ce values (0.98\u20131.09, average 1.04) and low Sr\/Th ratios of Luming apatites infer that the Mo\u2013W bearing granites are originated in consequence of partial melting of juvenile crustal material. Based on apatite geochemistry, we document first time varieties of ore deposits specifically Mo\u2013W and Cu deposit in LYRB and Mo\u2013W deposit in Luming which are developed under lower oxygen fugacity. The compiled geochemical data and interpretations propose that apatite chemical constituents are worthwhile to pinpoint polymetallic mineralization and fingerprint for ore types. In view of these findings, we confirm that apatite is not only consistent to trace geological facts about parental magma characteristics but also a reliable pointer of geodynamic evolution and ore varieties.\n               ","76":"\n                  The Wharton basin is situated in the north-eastern part of the Indian Ocean. In 2012 it hosted the largest intraplate strike-slip earthquakes ever recorded by geophysical networks. The Mw 8.6 earthquake of April 11, 2012, was preceded by a major foreshock (Mw 7.2) on January 10 and was followed two hours afterward by a Mw 8.2 event. These three large events occurred at the diffuse boundary between the Indian and Australian plates and were almost pure strike-slips on sub-vertical rupture surfaces. Using GRACE data, we first extracted the coseismic and postseismic gravity signals caused by these earthquakes. Then we fitted both GPS and the highest available spatial resolution of GRACE data using the geometry of the fault system suggested by Hill et al. (2015). We propose a regularization, which allows to solve for a linear problem in order to invert GPS and GRACE data under constraints on the rake angle. Our inversion yields a uniform displacement field on all elements of a given fault plane. Our solution shows that even the main displacement occurred on WNW trending faults, comparable displacement also occurred on a rupture striking NNE. Hence, we show that the deformation in this diffuse plate boundary region in 2012 was accommodated by displacements along both fault-systems.\n                  A viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere with a Maxwell viscosity 1019 Pa\u2219s successfully explains the postseismic displacements at GPS sites and postseismic gravity signals. The limited postseismic aftershock activity suggests small postseismic slip in the area of the 2012 Wharton earthquakes contrary to what is often observed after large subduction event. Because a part of the observed signal could be related to afterslip, our obtained Maxwell viscosity value should be considered as a lower limit of the asthenospheric viscosity below the Wharton basin.\n               ","77":"\n                  Earth tides, the response of the earth\u2019s crust to global gravity forces, have generally been detected as changes in tilt and strain and as changes in groundwater potential.

The focus of the presented work is on the study of micro-temperature variations associated with fluid flow, in observation wells drilled at the campus of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. According to the results obtained by long-term and high precision temperature measurements in the subsurface indicate transient heat flow components of different origins. The diurnal and seasonal changes as well as long-term variations in temperature at ground surface propagate into the subsurface. Temperature perturbations by fluid flow, induced by the deformation of the earth\u2019s crust following tectonic and earth tidal stress changes, are found to be superimposed on thermal effects of heat flow of the earth\u2019s interior. Periodic micro-temperature variations with peak to peak amplitudes of ca. 2\u2009mK were identified in the recorded data by time series analysis. At larger depths (>30\u2009m) the conductive penetration of the annual surface temperature variation does not exceed 1\u2009mK, but fluid flow mainly in fractured rock aquifers have been found to be capable of contributing to transient heat flow components with temperature effects of magnitudes larger than 1\u2009mK. Such temperature variations have been attributed to changes in volume strain induced by earth tides. Earth tidal signals can be identified in the frequency spectra of long-term thermal time series, recorded in observation wells.\n               ","78":"\n                  Drilling cores of the Yanchang Formation, a clastic deposit of Middle to Late Triassic age in the Ordos Basin on the North China Block, show strongly deformed layers that are interpreted as seismites.

The seismites are interpreted to have been caused by earthquakes related to the collisional tectonics during a major phase of the complex collision between the South China Block and the North China Block.

Abundance of K-feldspar phenocrysts and higher K2O content (1.19\u20137.0\u2009wt.%) in some adakites identify them as potassic adakites. The geochemical characteristics of the calc-alkaline andesite-dacite-rhyolites (ADR) reflect on typical island arc environment involving the processes of fractional crystallization and crustal contamination in an active continental margin environment. The NEBA and Mg-andesites are the products of hybridized mantle wedge under the influence of slab fluids\/melts whereas the Na-adakites are the slab melts erupted within the oceanic domain and the K-adakites were emplaced under the influence of continental crust during the migration of the island arc towards the continental margin.

Anomalies of ionospheric TEC changes were defined for 15-days before and 4-days after the earthquakes by using 15-days moving median method with the length of 15 days. Earthquakes were first grouped according to their magnitudes, and then negative and positive TEC anomalies in quiet days before the earthquakes were detected. These anomalies were observed as \u223c5\u201313, \u223c5-10, \u223c5-15, \u223c3-13, \u223c7-15, \u223c1 and \u223c5-8 days ago for the earthquakes of 6.0 \u2264 Mw<6.5, 6.5 \u2264 Mw<7.0, 7.0 \u2264 Mw<7.5, 7.5 \u2264 Mw<8.0, 8.0 \u2264 Mw<8.5, 8.5 \u2264 Mw<9.0, and 9.0 \u2264 Mw<9.5, respectively. Mean of changes in TEC anomalies of these groups is 44.2 % TECU and we detected that the number of positive anomalies in each group is larger than the number of negative anomalies.

The analyzed shear zone is located in the footwall of a regional tectonic contact between metaophiolites (Ligurian Complex) on the top, and the continental Lungro-Verbicaro Unit (Adria plate) at the bottom. The latter consists of a metasedimentary succession with Triassic shallow-water carbonates at the base of it, evolving upward to Jurassic-lower Miocene slope to deep basin carbonates and foredeep siliciclastic rocks. Both oceanic and continental successions are characterized by high-pressure and low-temperature (HP-LT) metamorphism. The analyzed mylonites show different degrees of strain, ranging from protomylonites to ultramylonites, the latter characterized by well-marked foliation and stretching lineations. Several micro- and mesoscale progressive deformation structures, including two fold sets, S-C\u2019 structures are present in these rocks, and a late oblique foliation, indicating a NW sense of shear. A successive shortening stage produced thrust faults and related folds, indicating a tectonic transport toward SE. We associate the mylonitic deformation with the activity of the overlying detachment fault, which is responsible for the synorogenic exhumation of the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit during the Miocene time. However, the ductile strain, recorded by the studied mylonites, accounted for a small displacement during the exhumation of this tectonic slice. In fact, the calculated displacement achieved by the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit, during exhumation, is much larger than the one estimated considering only the ductile zones activity. This evidence suggests that, synchronously with ductile strain, brittle deformation occurred along the detachment fault located at the top of the thrust sheet. In addition, a severe erosion due to the tectonic exhumation of the HP-LT rocks (in the late Miocene) produced a large amount of clastic sediment that filled the extensional basins widespread in northern Calabria.\n               ","82":"\n                  It is well known that GNSS permanent station coordinate time series exhibit time-correlated noise.

The record of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean stretches across Eurasia from the European Alps eastward to the southwestern South China block (SCB). Tectonic domes of the SCB record the contraction, extension, decompression, and partial melting of deep crust that occurred as a result of detachment faulting and tectonic evolution of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean. This study investigates post-orogenic (Kwangsian) extension and opening of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean as recorded by the Motianling core complex in the southwestern SCB, based on structural analysis and 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology. The Motianling core complex in the southernmost part of the Jiangnan fold belt comprises the Sanfang gneissic granite surrounded by low-grade metasedimentary rocks. The core complex records at least three deformation (D) events: pre-D1, D1, and D2. The pre-D1 event produced large-scale NE-striking folds with axial surface cleavages and was coeval with emplacement of the Sanfang batholith. D1 deformation is represented by a top-to-the-NW ductile\u2013brittle normal faulting system with mylonitic foliation and was coincident with greenschist-facies metamorphism, indicating that the core complex formed during NW\u2013SE extension. D2 deformation is dominated by Cenozoic NW\u2013SE-trending normal faults. The timing of D1 deformation and subsequent cooling was constrained by 40Ar\/39Ar geochronology. Syn-kinematic muscovite yields an 40Ar\/39Ar age of 417 \u00b1 2.3 Ma (1\u03c3) and suggests that the dome was initially developed in the Early Devonian through ductile shear zones. Magmatic biotite from the granitic mylonite yields a weighted mean 40Ar\/39Ar age of 363.0 \u00b1 3.1 Ma. Therefore, the Motianling core complex records at least two major stages of tectonic evolution: (1) Kwangsian (Caledonian) orogenic collapse and subsequent first-stage cooling at \u223c417 to 363 Ma; and (2) Cenozoic regional extension and final cooling at ca. 45 Ma, as inferred from published apatite fission track data.

On 20 March 2019, an Mw 5.7 earthquake struck the Acipayam basin in southwestern Turkey, which is the largest event to occur in the basin. Here, we use Sentinel-1A interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to investigate the cosesimic deformation related to the Acipayam earthquake. The ascending and descending interforegrams suggest the normal faulting during this earthquake, with the maximum line of sight (LOS) displacements of 4.6 cm and 4.8 cm, respectively. The fault geometric parameters and a detailed coseismic distributed slip model of this event are retrieved by using geodetic data for the first time. Though the coseismic interferograms don\u2019t show enough polarity changes to ascertain the dip orientation of the rupture fault, we regard the northeast-dipping fault as the causative fault by a joint analysis of the residuals plots, 2.5 dimensional (2.5D) deformation field, field investigation results, regional geomorphic feature and overall distribution of aftershock (4.0 < Mw < 4.9). The inversion results show that coseismic rupture was mainly dominated by normal faulting with minor sinistral strike-slip components. The rupture fault is a blind normal fault and the main slip is concentrated in the depth range of 3\u223c9.5 km with a maximum slip of approximately 0.33 m at a depth of \u223c6 km. The InSAR-determined geodetic seismic moment is 3.96 \u00d7 1017 Nm corresponding to Mw 5.7. Our model resolution test supports these interpretations for the Acipayam earthquake. Based on the coseismic Coulomb stress change, we find that this 2019 event increases the stress loading in the northwestern and southeastern segment of the rupture fault plane and possibly triggers the subsequent Mw 4.8 and Mw 4.9 earthquakes. The mechanism of the determined seismogenic fault may be helpful to evaluate seismic hazards and understand the evolution of the Acipayam basin.\n               ","85":"\n                  The pseudo-spectral form of the sea level equation (SLE) requires the approximation of a radially-symmetric visco-elastic Earth. Thus, the resulting predictions of sea level change (SLC) and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) often ignore lateral variations in the Earth structure. Here, we assess the capabilities of a Multiple 1D Earth Approach (M1DEA) applied to large-scale ice load components with different Earth structures to account for these variations. In this approach the total SLC and GIA responses result from the superposition of individual responses from each load component, each computed globally assuming locally-appropriate 1D Earth structures. We apply the M1DEA to three separate regions (East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and outside Antarctica) to analyze uplift rates for a range of Earth structures and different ice loads at various distances. We find that the uplift response is mostly sensitive to the local Earth structure, which supports the usefulness of the M1DEA. However, stresses transmitted across rheological boundaries (e.g., producing peripheral bulges) present challenges for the M1DEA, but can be minimized under two conditions: (1) If the considered time period of ice loading for each component is consistent with the relaxation time of the local Earth structure. (2) If the load components can be subdivided according to the scale of the lateral variations in Earth structure. Overall, our results indicate that M1DEA could be a computationally much cheaper alternative to 3D finite element models, but further work is needed to quantify the relative accuracy of both methods for different resolutions, loads, and Earth structure variations.\n               ","86":"\n                  Detailed knowledge of the crustal structure along the North Anatolian Fault Zone can help in understanding past and present tectonic processes in relation to the deformation history. To estimate the frequency-dependent crustal attenuation parameters beneath the western part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone we apply acoustic radiative transfer theory under the assumption of multiple isotropic scattering to generate synthetic seismogram envelopes. The inversion depends on finding an optimal fit between observed and synthetically computed coda wave envelopes in five frequency bands. 2-D lateral variation of intrinsic and scattering attenuation at various frequencies tends to three crustal blocks (i.e., Armutlu-Almac\u0131k, Istanbul-Zonguldak and Sakarya Zones) separated by the southern and northern branches of the western part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Overall, scattering attenuation appears to be dominant over intrinsic attenuation in the study area at lower frequencies. Relatively low attenuation properties are observed beneath the older Istanbul Zone whereas higher attenuation properties are found for the younger Sakarya Zone. The Armutlu\u2013Almac\u0131k Zone exhibits more complex lateral variations. Very high attenuation values towards the west characterize the area of the Kuzuluk Basin, a pull-apart basin formed under west-east extension. Our coda-derived moment magnitudes are similar to the local magnitude estimates that were previously calculated for the same earthquakes. For smaller earthquakes (ML < 2.5), however, the relation between local and moment magnitudes appears to lose its coherency. This may stem from various reasons including the use of seismic data recorded in finite sampling interval, possible biases in local magnitude estimates of earthquake catalogues as well as biases due to wrong assumptions to consider anelastic attenuation terms.\n               ","87":"\n                  We investigate a nearly 8-year record (2010\u20132018) of the superconducting gravimeter OSG-060 located at Djougou (Benin, West Africa). We first perform a tidal analysis with ET34-ANA v7.1\u202fsoftware that leads to the gravimetric amplitude and phase factors for all separable waves according to the available time duration. We test nine different ocean tide models for the main eleven tidal constituents (Ssa, Mm, Mf, Q1, O1, P1, K1, N2, M2, S2, K2). After correction for ocean tidal loading we obtain the real and imaginary parts of the residual vector. We also investigate atmospheric loading which is dominated in this equatorial location by the thermal waves S1 and S2 that are modulated in amplitude by annual and semi-annual components. After correction for ocean loading, we test different air pressure corrections on the tidal gravimetric factors for the waves Sa, Ssa, S1 and S2.

The clockwise rotation of \u223c40\u00b0 of the WBB since 64.4 Ma (early Paleocene) with respect to stable Asia is attributable to the India-Asia collision, and the later counterclockwise rotation of 14.6\u00b0\u00b14.2\u00b0 since 26.6 Ma (late Oligocene) is attributable to the dextral-slip faulting activity of the Sagaing Fault.

We identify a deep regional fault located beneath the XFSB, which cuts through the reflection Moho below the belt and is interpreted as representing the collisional boundary between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks along the southeastern margin of the belt. We identify structural evidence for collision between the two blocks, including two groups of layered narrow slip belts (\u223c30 km) in the middle crust, one distributed in the Yangtze Block and the other in the Cathaysia Block. A narrow velocity-gradient belt in the upper mantle at a depth of \u223c90 km is revealed by numerous strong seismic reflectors, some of which are layered.

The Piquiri Syenite Massif (PSM) is an alkaline pluton which exhibits S >> L magmatic fabric and is interpreted to be part of the last Neoproterozoic post-collisional magmatic episodes in southernmost Brazil. Thermomagnetic curves, hysteresis data and coercivity spectra obtained from representative samples of different facies in the massif reveal that magnetic susceptibility is dominated by ferromagnetic minerals, especially magnetite. Magnetic fabric data were determined by using Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and Anisotropy of Anhysteretic Remanence (AARM). Both fabrics are coaxial, and the parallelism of AMS and AARM tensors in more than 84 % of the sampled sites rules out the possibility of significant effects of Single Domain (SD) crystals. The magnetic foliation is concordant with the magmatic foliation field measurements, both parallel to pluton contacts, with high, inward dip angles. The magnetic lineation shows distinct but related behaviour from one facies to another. It is dominantly subvertical in the marginal facies rocks and plunges at moderate to shallow angles in the main facies. It is sub-horizontal in the quartz-syenites and plunges at shallow angles in the granitic rocks. Oxidizing conditions determined from the study of magnetic mineralogy leads to challenge former interpretation of in situ differentiation and crystallization and points to the multi-intrusive character of the pluton. Field relations such as fragments of marginal facies rocks found within the main facies rocks, which are in turn intruded by quartz-syenites, together with the general absence of contact metamorphism except near the marginal facies, lead to interpret that a sequence of magmatic pulses have built up the pluton. Thus, a first magmatic pulse may have heated the host rocks and resulted in the marginal facies which was followed by the next pulses to form the main facies and the quartz-rich varieties, therefore constructing the pluton from outside inwards.\n               ","91":"\n                  Knowledge of the deformation history and dominant factors influencing the formation of sub-salt structures is necessary to understand the formation of sub-salt traps. In this study, the discrete-element method (DEM) is used to assess the deformation mechanism of sub-salt structures in the Central Kelasu fold-thrust belt of the Kuqa Depression. A series of DEM models of the Central Kelasu fold-thrust belt are constructed, the final deformation styles of the models are compared with the real structures in order to determine the fitting degree of each models, and the dominant factors influencing the formation of sub-salt structures are determined. A thin salt layer promotes the deformation in the sub-salt sequence. Salt sub-sags, basal uplifts, and pre-existing faults can also promote the deformation in the sub-salt sequence in the northern part of the models. Large deformations accumulate in pre-existing structures in the northern part of the models, and then subsequent deformations are also transmitted to the salt layer and supra-salt sequence; however, these deformations are hardly transmitted to the sub-salt sequence in the middle and southern parts of the models. Among the eight DEM models constructed in our research, the horizontal-stratum model without any initial structures showed the best fit to actual phenomena. Earlier simple structures of Mesozoic layers can be deformed into the current complex structures under compression effects in the late Himalayan period. By comparing with other regions and analyzing the deformation progress of the DEM model, the sub-salt structures in the Kuqa Depression are considered to be fold-accommodation fault structures.\n               ","92":"\n                  On August 24th 2016, a Mw 6.0 earthquake started the Amatrice - Norcia (Central Italy) seismic sequence, generated by the extensional tectonics along the Apennines, that had its apex with the Mw 6.5 October 30th mainshock. As a unique documented case reported in Italy, complex surface faulting occurred during both earthquakes along the Mt. Vettore fault. Multiple surface faulting was accompanied at depth by the development of a km-scale normal fault-propagation fold. This fold was characterized by breakthrough and by surface rupture within thick carbonatic layers only in the central and north-western area (Mt. Vettore). On the contrary, the fault remained blind where flexural slip was active in sandy-silty turbiditic deposits in the south-eastern area (Mt. Gorzano). We explain the different faulting behaviour with the occurrence of more rigid and competent lithologies in areas characterized by breakthrough and with the occurrence of weak lithologies in areas characterized by blind faulting. Overall, the entire seismic sequence appears as a gradual gravitational adjustment of the hangingwall block, slipping along a NW-trending and 80\u202fkm long fault system. In particular, the following crustal blocks, partially overlapping and with different length (30, 40 and 22\u202fkm, respectively), progressively collapsed during the sequence: the Amatrice sector during the August 24th 2016, Mw 6.0 event, the Norcia-Visso sector during the October 26th 2016, Mw 5.9 and the 2016 October 30th Mw 6.5 event, and the Campotosto Lake sector during the four January 18th 2017, M\u202f>\u202f5 events. The progressive involvement of these three rock volumes, during the seismic sequence is here explained by the occurrence of a low angle detachment that limited the maximum potential depth of the mainshocks and consequently the dimensions of involved rock volumes, therefore limiting the magnitudes of the mainshocks.\n               ","93":"\n                  The southernmost South America has been affected by the subduction of an oceanic seismic ridge, which began to subduct below southern Patagonia at \u223c14 Ma. This scenario led to the formation of a slab window, which is still active and where hot buoyant asthenospheric mantle produced thermal anomalies and modifications in the lithospheric thicknesses. Meanwhile, from the Patagonian Andes to the Atlantic coast, an outstanding regional surface uplift took place, conducting to a moderated-elevation plateau formation. In this work we analyzed the causes of this long-wavelength surface elevation change using residual topography and uplift rate calculations, considering paleo-lithospheric states. We achieved this considering that the study area underwent a lithospheric thickness changes through time, before and after the slab window formation. This allowed us to estimate the isostatic and dynamic adjustment over time and their influences on the surface elevation changes. These rates were compared with geological and stratigraphic observations derived from a key elevation marker bed: The modern altitudes of Oligo-Miocene marine strata top, originally deposited close or below sea level, and placed at Present at hundreds of meters above sea level. Our residual topography calculations, that result from comparing isostatic and observed topography, indicates the dynamic topography contribution in the study region was very minor (if so) to null. The isostatic uplift, in turn, shows a remarkable fitting with the reconstruction of marine marker bed, suggesting a causative relationship. We can assert that Patagonian lithospheric thinning, particularly of the lithospheric mantle, by slab window formation, would have been enough to reproduce the modern elevations and surface uplift across the plateau from the Miocene to Present day. Our work opens a question on the model that connect slab windows, asthenospheric upwelling flows with surface uplifting. However, as shown by recent works, lithospheric changes might trigger small convection cells, which might produce local and small dynamic topography.\n               ","94":"\n                  Shear wave splitting measurements show that the anisotropy beneath central Aleutian subduction region is complex.

Bending and offscraping of the downgoing plate are processes occurring at subduction zones and acting against plate motions. These localised dissipative processes cause extensional deformation in the bulge-foredeep region and thrusting and folding in the thrust wedge respectively. Within this framework, widespread early subduction-related extensional structures affecting pre-orogenic rocks of the downgoing plate of fossil subduction systems, are commonly interpreted as induced by extension occurring in the forebulge-foredeep zone. Slab pull is to date, rarely considered as a potential causative process when interpreting basin-scale pre-shortening extensional structures. The problem of distinguishing slab-pull and foreland flexuring induced extensional structures relates to the fact that for most belts, slab pull and forebulge-foredeep flexuring are expected to produce extension roughly in the same direction (i.e. parallel to the foredeep-belt system) and, when syn-kinematic strata are not available, discriminating between these two processes is arduous. In this work we present a field investigation of basin-scale extensional faults from the downgoing plate of the Oman Mts. fossil subduction system. Syn-kinematic strata indicate that normal fault development largely predated extension in the bulge-foredeep region. Herein, we argue that such faulting occurred during the transition from induced to self-sustained subduction, when the negative buoyancy of the slab started to exceed the resisting forces and the downgoing plate began to be pulled towards the trench.\n               ","98":"\n                  The Horjand area is part of the Kashmar-Kerman tectonic zone in the Central Iranian block, where the oldest continental crust of Iran can be found. Mafic igneous rocks associated with sedimentary units (gypsum, shale, limestone, dolomite and sandstone) belong to the magmatism of the Late Neoproterozoic\u2013Early Cambrian Desu Series. Based on petrographic studies, the mafic igneous rocks comprise medium to coarse gabbro, micro-gabbro and hornblende-gabbro. The rocks mainly consist of plagioclase, olivine, clinopyroxene, biotite, amphibole and Fe-Ti oxides. The gabbroic rocks have a variable compositional range, with SiO2 (44.6\u201352.9\u202fwt. %), MgO (2.94\u201313.83 %), CaO (5.56\u201315.23\u202fwt. %) and TiO2 (1.19\u20132.68\u202fwt. %) contents. Petrographic evidence and geochemical data suggest that fractional crystallization has played an important role in the evolution of the ascending magma of the gabbroic rocks. The chemical composition of the minerals is similar to those of gabbroic rocks that were formed in a non-orogenic environment. The crystallization of clinopyroxene of gabbros mainly occurred under temperatures ranging from 1045 to 1216\u202f\u00b0C. The geochemical characteristics and mineral compositions of the gabbros show that the samples predominantly have alkaline to minor tholeiitic affinities. During magma ascent, crustal contamination was minor or absent. Rare earth element modeling demonstrates that the magma of the Horjand gabbros was produced from 10 to 15 percent partial melting of a spinel-garnet lherzolite mantle source. Chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns are LREE-enriched with (La\/Yb)N of 4.50-12.82. Both normalized REE and trace-element spidergrams are similar to patterns of HIMU-OIB (high mu (\u03bc\u202f=\u202fU\/Pb)-ocean island basalt) or intraplate alkaline magmatic rocks. The gabbros geochemically display an intra-plate tectonomagmatic setting without subduction geochemical characteristics. Based on the available data and mineral chemical composition the development of the Horjand gabbroic rocks could be related to an extensional phase, with upwelling melting of the asthenospheric mantle in the continental rift resulting in alkaline magmatism of Late Neoproterozoic\u2013Early Cambrian age, in the Central Iranian micro-continent.\n               ","99":"\n                  Numerous mafic dykes, sills and laccoliths crop out in the southern part of the Tafilalt basin (Eastern Anti-Atlas, Morocco). These rocks intrude the mildly folded Ordovician to Early Carboniferous formations, consisting mainly of lamprophyric dolerites and camptonites with minor gabbros and syenodiorites. Previous geochemical studies have shown that the Tafilalt magmatism of sodic-alkaline affinity has been produced by low degrees of partial melting from an enriched deep mantle source within the garnet stability field. However, the age and the geodynamic context of these rocks were presently unknown since no isotopic dating had so far been made of the Tafilalt dolerites. To resolve this issue, we present here the first 40Ar\/39Ar biotite and U-Pb zircon dating from the Tafilalt alkaline magmatism. Three samples (biotite separates) yielded well-defined 40Ar\/39Ar plateau ages of 264.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.7 Ma, 259.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.3 Ma and 262.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5 Ma whereas 206Pb\/238U dating of zircon from one of these samples yielded an age of 255\u202f\u00b1\u202f3 Ma. These ages coincide within the dating error, and indicate that this magmatism occurred in the late Permian. Considering geochronological and geochemical data, we propose that the Tafilalt magmatism reflects an early-rift magmatic activity that preceded the Triassic rifting heralded by the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. This magmatic activity is recorded in both sides of the future Atlantic Ocean by small-volume alkaline magmatism that started in the late Permian and extends into the Triassic. The alkaline magmas are probably generated in response to an increase in the mantle potential temperature underneath the Pangea supercontinent.\n               ","100":"\n                  The late Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) igneous and metamorphic complex that constitutes the main part of the Precambrian basement in Iran is exposed in southwestern Saqqez in the northern Sanandaj-Sirjan zone (SaSZ), which is called the Ediacaran complex in this study. New zircon U\u2013Pb dating from five samples shows that the crystallization of the main granitic bodies happened 559 to 547\u202fMa in the late Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran). The Ediacaran complex in southwest Saqqez includes: (a) metarhyolite-sedimentary sequences; (b) metagranite; and (c) metadiorite-monzonitic bodies with some late stage dikes. Whole-rock compositions of the granites show high contents of SiO2 (62.9\u201380.5\u202fwt.%), K2O (0.1\u20134.0\u202fwt.%), and Al2O3 (9.7\u201319.1\u202fwt.%) with low contents of MgO (0.2\u20132.4 wt.%), Fe2O3 (0.7\u20136.9\u202fwt.%), and TiO2 (0.1\u20131.0\u202fwt.%). Negative \u03b5Nd(t) (\u22125.2 to \u22123.0) and high initial ratios of 87Sr\/86Sr (0.7101 to 0.7328) indicate the main role of crustal components in the sources of the granitic bodies. The metadiorite-monzonitic rocks have high contents of Fe2O3 (6.4\u201310.7\u202fwt.%), MgO (6.6\u20138.1\u202fwt.%), CaO (5.7\u20139.7\u202fwt.%), and TiO2 (0.4\u20131.2\u202fwt.%) with positive \u03b5Nd(t) (+2.9 to +4.4) values. Whole rocks compositions and 87Sr\/86Sr\u2013143Nd\/144Nd isotope ratios show different sources for the metagranite and metadiorite-monzonite groups, which are consistent with continental crust and subcontinental lithospheric mantle released melts, respectively. The high contents of Th with low contents of the transitional elements such as Nb-Ta with calc-alkaline affinity of the both intermediate and acidic rocks infer the relation of these rocks to an active continental margin over the subduction zone in the late Neoproterozoic which is associated with Proto-Tethys subduction beneath northern Gondwana in that time.\n               ","101":"\n                  A reconstruction of the Late Devonian arc belt in the West Junggar and adjacent Kazakhstan regions is crucial for understanding the architecture of the southwestern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.

While several geological models have been discussed, the mechanism of the Mesozoic African rift system is still unclear. One model proposed that the mechanism of the Mesozoic African rift system was inherited from the Benue Trough, which is a failed arm of the Guinea triple junction. Other models suggested that the mechanism of the Mesozoic African rift system could be clarified by the spreading of the Atlantic and weak lithospheric zones, such as the Pan-African suture zone. In this research paper, we create a shell model that considers spherical curvature, the heterogeneous structure of the African basement framework, and a combination of the upwelling St. Helena plume and seafloor spreading. The calculation of the model is solved through the finite element software ANSYS, and the modeling results match the actual geological evidence. In this study, nine other models are created with altered rock parameters or boundary constraints and compared to the original model to examine the influence of these factors. Compared to the nine comparative models, the original model best reflects the calculated results, which indicates that the coupling of the St. Helena mantle plume and ocean-ridge spreading caused the initial lithospheric rifting at \u223c130 Ma and that the heterogeneities within Africa did not affect the extension direction of the rift basin but did influence the location of the rift basin.\n               ","104":"\n                  Based on a set of rigorously computed velocities of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) sites of the CEGRN (Central European GNSS Research Network) we identify a number of areas with large scale tectonic structures and interpolate the velocities to the profiles by least squares collocation. The resulting velocity field provides an invaluable data set for the investigation of present day crustal deformation at the continental scale. We present six velocity profiles covering structural features of Central Eastern Europe and at the same time well populated by GNSS sites, to minimize interpolation errors. One N-S profile samples the stretching of the crust in the Balkan-Aegean region, three E-W profiles sample the part of Central Europe north of the Black Sea, one SW-NE profile crosses the Trans European Suture Zone. A sixth profile outlines the shear deformation associated with the eastward extrusion of the Eastern Alps towards the Pannonian Basin. Analytical modelling of the first and last profiles, for which there is a significant deformation, provides quantitative constraints on the relation between back arc retreat and extensional deformation in the continental crust (Aegean-Balkan profile), and model parameters such as the locking depth of faults accommodating the lateral extrusion of the Eastern Alps. For the four remaining profiles, across the TESZ and the Central Europe through the Carpathians, we report a westward velocity East of the TESZ and Carpathians. The velocities appear to drop West of these structures, suggesting that in a conventional \u2018European fixed\u2019 reference frame the East European Craton is generating a small compressional strain in a nearly E-W direction.

In this study, high-resolution crustal tomography beneath tectono-magmatic lake regions (Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek) of Eastern Anatolia (Turkey) was used to estimate Poisson\u2019s ratio from the Vp and Vs structures through the joint inversion analyses of the travel times of Vp and Vs using the station records of the permanent network of Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI, Turkey). The results of Poisson\u2019s ratio anomaly reveal distinct and substantial variations in the different tectonic units and show a prominent, continuous and dense high Poisson\u2019s ratio anomalies in the range of 0.27 to 0.30 for the lowermost crust\/the uppermost mantle beneath the regions of Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek and comparably low average Poisson\u2019s ratio (\u223c0.23) anomalies for the brittle crust in several local areas. High Poisson's ratios (over \u223c0.29) in the basins of Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek and in the vicinity of their boundary faults appear to be due to partial melts. Low Poisson\u2019s ratios (\u223c0.23) near seismogenetic faults at \u223c14\u202fkm depth beneath the lake regions suggest weaker and more easily deformable crust. The high and low Poisson\u2019s ratio structures suggest a strongly fault-controlled and highly heterogeneous crustal architecture beneath the lake regions. High Poisson\u2019s ratios at variable depths suggest that the mafic content beneath the lake regions is higher than has ever been expected, thus indicating the existence of intrusive materials of possible mantle origin, interacting with faulted crustal rocks. The regional extent of the high Poisson\u2019s ratios (0.27-0.30) of the lowermost crust\/the uppermost mantle proposes strong interaction of partial melts with active tectonics in the basins of Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek. Key constraints from the estimated Poisson\u2019s ratios and V-anomalies indicate the diverse and interactive nature of crustal deformations beneath the lake regions where the underplating of the mantle magma scenario is proposed to exert a key control on tectono-magmatic evolution of the regions of Lakes Van and Er\u00e7ek and serves as a working hypothesis for further studies.\n               ","106":"\n                  We investigate a fault model for the shallow, strong (Mw6.6) tsunamigenic earthquake of 20 July 2017 with source area in the east Aegean Sea between Bodrum peninsula (Turkey) and Kos Isl.

In this paper, we use surface data, recently collected and processed subsurface seismic refection data, isopach map of Lower Jurassic and balanced sections to propose pre-existing half-graben system developed in the Lower Jurassic with this fold-and-thrust belt. We also use results of a series of scaled sandbox analogue models, where industrial CT apparatus was used to monitor deformation, to simulate the evolution of this fold-and-thrust belt. We suggest that the segmented shape of the Huoerguosi-Manasi-Tugulu fold-and-thrust belt is a response to the presence of thrust ramps, which were formed during Early Jurassic. During Late Cenozoic shortening, the Lower Jurassic syn-rift sediments served as major detachment horizon, making a pre-existing normal fault act as a stress concentration zone leading to steeping of a thrust-ramp over the normal fault and cover detachment overstep the underlying half-grabens.

The primitive mantle-normalized trace element spider diagram is characterized by incompatible element-rich patterns and negative Nb anomalies. The tectonic discrimination diagrams show that the volcanic rocks were formed by arc-related volcanism rather than within-plate volcanism. K-Ar dating of feldspars from six volcanic rocks yields ages ranging from 270 to 239\u202fMa, indicating that andesitic and dacitic magmatism occurred during this period.

The zircon U-Pb ages, integrating with the FT ages and available paleocurrents, suggest that the Paleoproterozoic basement rocks and Late Paleozoic plutonic rocks of the Alxa Block are the source rocks for the Triassic sandstones, and the Jurassic sandstones are associated with a multi-cycling sedimentation.

Their complete subaerial exposure was accompanied by widespread erosion. Its products were transported across northeast Gondwana to the nearby Mediterranean and Mesopotamian basins while leaving behind a Regional Truncation Surface (RTS). The uplift mechanism is debated. Some claim it results from the Oligocene updoming of Afar mantle plume across northeastern Gondwana. Others suggest GondwanaEurasia convergence that reached hard-docking during the Oligocene is the dominant process. Miocene-to-Holocene post-truncation tectonics deformed the leveled RTS (peneplain) relief while erosion continued. As a result, only scarce and widely distributed evidence for erosion remained across Arabia. The current study addresses this debate through the examination of the morphological development of the converging plate on the verge of entering the subduction zone. The study focuses on the mode of erosion across the Galilee basins of northern Israel. Based on the interpretation of 69 multichannel seismic reflection profiles (extending along 800\u2009km), correlated with 68 boreholes and all previous geological mapping, we distinguish between pre-, syn- and post-truncation stratigraphic units. Results show that the RTS subcrop comprises a mosaic of diachronous formations, spanning the Upper Cretaceous and Oligocene. Stratigraphy constrains the overall duration of truncation between Late Eocene and Early Miocene. A new observation into the truncation period shown here enhances the morphological expression of ocean bottom exposure. The maximum thickness of strata removed reaches \u02dc1300\u2009m during a 7\u2009\u00b1\u20092 million year time window. A conservative time estimation yields a weathering rate of 0.186\u2009\u00b1\u20090.058\u2009mm per year, under a subtropical climate suggested for the Oligocene in this region. Preservation of syn-truncation sediments in local fault-bounded depressions attests to a regional NNE trending flexural uplift accompanied by local extensions. Truncation sediments derived from these erosional events accumulated across the western and eastern flanks of the Galilee, under marine conditions. We suggest that this flexure developed along a northward propagating arm of the Afar plume.

The fracture pattern represents three-dimensional strain of rocks with characteristics distinct from previously known bi-, four- or poly-modal faulting, and thus is unable to be interpreted in terms of the corresponding theories such as conjugate faulting, slip on preexisting weak planes and tensile crack interaction, respectively. Here, a super-critical stress model is advanced to decode stress significance of the specific fracture pattern with a particular emphasis on model prediction for orientations of failure surfaces. The model is an extension of the slip model of Reches (1983) that prescribes formation of four sets of faults in orthorhombic symmetry conforming to the Coulomb-Mohr criterion of \u03c4=C+\u03bc\u03c3 (equivalent to C=F=\u03c4-\u03bc\u03c3 where C is cohesion of rocks and F is function of shear stress \u03c4, normal stress \u03c3 and friction coefficient \u03bc). The mechanic boundary condition means a super-critical stress state (Fmax>C) because stress resolution allows only two sets of planes to coevally have maximum value of F and thus shear fail equally according to Andersonian (1905, 1951) conjugate faulting derivation that corresponds to a critical stress state, i.e., Fmax is just equal to C. This super-critical stress state further means that there are some planes on which F>C certainly on verge of faulting at least possessing a not even lower tendency than those planes on which C=F, and thus polymodal faulting results. The planes with F\u2265C tend to be areal distribution with arc or annular geometry in stereographic projection of poles. Given the Coulomb-Mohr friction and failure criteria are not fundamentally different, the super-critical model may also apply to initial failure of intact rocks. The new model represents a major reorganization in thinking about shear failure of rocks and fracturing patterns.

Ongoing wrench faulting since continental collision at \u02dc14 Ma has further complicated the pattern of lithotectonic units, particularly those that were obducted out of the Neotethyan realm. The new data indicate that the Iraqi sector of Neotethys was not \u2018quiet\u2019 in the Cretaceous, but contains fragments of arcs of that age, contiguous with those along strike in Turkey, Iran and the Himalayas.\n               ","117":"\n                  In the north-eastern part of the Chotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex (CGGC), India, mafic granulite occurs as enclaves within the \u02dc1450 Ma old felsic rocks. The mafic granulite and the host felsic rock develop a pervasive planar fabric defined by minerals that are characteristics of high pressure (HP) granulite facies metamorphism. The earliest discernable mineral assemblage in the mafic granulites comprises amphibole\u2009+\u2009clinopyroxene\u2009+\u2009plagioclase\u2009+\u2009quartz\u2009+\u2009ilmenite, preserved as inclusions within garnet porphyroblasts as a record of early M0 stage. Subsequently, the assemblage garnet\u2009+\u2009clinopyroxene\u2009+\u2009plagioclase\u2009+\u2009rutile\u2009+\u2009quartz developed during the peak metamorphic stage (Mi) defining the pervasive fabric. Quantitative geothermobarometry and intersection of isopleths in a phase diagram (pseudosection) that was numerically computed for a representative bulk composition of the mafic granulites, yield 12\u2009\u00b1\u20091 kbar and 800\u2009\u00b1\u200950\u2009\u00b0C for the Mi stage. Subsequent changes in physical conditions in response to tectonic evolution of the complex developed two distinct sets of mineral assemblages (Mii and Miii). Firstly, garnet\u2009\u00b1\u2009clinopyroxene\u2009+\u2009quartz broke down to symplectic aggregates of orthopyroxene\u2009+\u2009plagioclase under static conditions (Mii stage). Afterwards, the anhydrous minerals, which developed during the M0-ii stages, were variably replaced by amphibole-bearing assemblages (Miii stage). Geothermobarometric estimates and the stability of different assemblages that developed during M0-Miii stages, define a clockwise (CW) P\u2013T path with an inferred geothermal gradient of \u02dc20\u2009\u00b0C\/km during the culmination of HP Mi metamorphism. The reconstructed CW P-T path and the inferred geothermal gradient are consistent with a continent-continent collisional tectonic setting. Integrating all the existing information, it is considered that a large part, if not the whole, of the CGGC behaved as a coherent lower plate during the globally extensive convergent margin orogenesis at the time of Rodinia supercontinant formation.\n               ","118":"\n                  In far North Greenland at the head of Victoria Fjord (\u223c81\u00b030\u2032N), a \u223c1000\u202fkm2 exposure of Precambrian crystalline basement rocks is a window through the region's extensive latest Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic Arctic Platform sedimentary cover sequence. These basement rocks, named here the Victoria Fjord terrane, are dominated by weakly-foliated granodioritic orthogneisses, with lesser amounts of migmatite. These are intercalated with strips of supracrustal rocks dominated by paragneisses. This poorly-exposed Archean terrane at Greenland's northern tip is succeeded to the south by the extensive east-west trending Paleoproterozoic Inglefield Mobile Belt of juvenile arc rocks.\n                  The Victoria Fjord terrane granodiorites have zircon U-Pb ages from 3292\u202f\u00b1\u202f14\u202fMa to \u223c3260\u202fMa. Reconnaissance U-Pb dating on schlieric migmatite zircons yielded ages of \u223c3280, 3400 and 3500\u202fMa. Paragneiss detrital zircons have ages of mostly \u223c2710\u202fMa, with a minority of 3000\u20132900\u202fMa grains. This demonstrates that these sedimentary rocks were not derived from the local basement. Post- Archean magmatic or metamorphic zircon was not detected in any of the samples.\n                  Initial \u03b5Hf of 3290\u20133260\u202fMa granodiorite and granite zircons ranges from \u22124 to +2, and the magmatic protoliths are interpreted as sourced from the melting of somewhat older (3500\u20133400\u202fMa) Paleoarchean crust, represented by paleosome in the migmatites. The paragneiss 3000\u20132900\u202fMa detrital zircons were derived from juvenile felsic crust of that age. The \u223c2710\u202fMa group show negative correlation of Th\/U and initial \u03b5Hf, such that those with high Th\/U up to >2.0 have \u03b5Hf values of \u22126 to \u221210. The \u223c2710 zircons were sourced from mafic rocks formed by melting of much older (Paleoarchean?) enriched mantle which was variably contaminated by 3000\u20132900\u202fMa crust during its ascent.\n                  The Victoria terrane is unique amongst the Archean basement terranes in Greenland because it is dominated by 3500\u20133260\u202fMa crust. However, the Arctic basin contains detrital zircons of that age, and rocks of that age also occur in eastern Siberia and northwestern Canada. Implications for high Arctic early Precambrian geodynamics are discussed.\n               ","119":"\n                  In Santuri- Kankarkiari area of Purulia, West Bengal, India, a nepheline syenite body cuts across the regional Grenvillian (\u223c1000\u2013950 Ma) fabric (S2) of the host Chotanagpur Granite Gneissic Complex (CGGC).

Field relations, \u2018frozen-in\u2019 textural feature, petrology and geochemistry of the studied rock and the published geological and geochronological information from the adjoining areas are consistent with (a) derivation of its magmatic protolith from the then sub-continental lithospheric mantle and emplacement of the melt in a rift basin (b) the rifting of the Grenvillian basement seems to have occurred during (\u223c950\u2013900 Ma) and (c) burial, deformation and metamorphism (peaked at 9\u201310 kbar, 690\u2013770\u2009\u00b0C) of the studied alkaline rocks and its Grenvillian basement seem to have occurred in a continent-continent collisional tectonic setting during \u223c900\u2013780Ma. The commonly perceived notion that the deformed alkaline rocks (DARs) are invariably linked to continental suture along which a former ocean basin floor was consumed is not supported in this study. Integrating all the information, we propose that the nepheline syenite of the studied area and also from parts of the Granulite Terrane of South India represent metamorphosed and deformed aulacogen rock ensemble that should not be associated with opening and closure of an oceanic crust. Combining the information of this study and the published works, it is demonstrated that the deformed alkaline rocks (DARs) can also form in a coherent crustal block without any connection with a continental suture zone. A plausible tectonic model for the evolution of the CGGC has also been presented.\n               "},"Text":{"0":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe Central Asian Orogenic belt (CAOB), which lies among Siberian craton, North China block, Tarim block, and East European craton (Seng\u04e7r et al., 1993) is a crucial geologic unit in understanding the development process of the Eurasian continent (Kovalenko et al., 2004) (\nFig. 1). It is generally accepted among scholars that the CAOB has been formed due to several processes such as subduction-accretion of the oceanic plate, volcanic arc magmatism, and collisions of continental fragments during the amalgamation of these cratons and blocks. In an area between the Siberian craton and the North China block, the geological setting of Mongolia is a significant factor to reveal the Paleozoic\u2013Mesozoic tectonics of the CAOB (Fig. 1). The northern Mongolia, southern margin of the \u201cSiberian continent\u201d (Siberian craton + accreted geologic units due to Pre-Permian orogeny), widely exposes Precambrian\u2013Paleozoic basement rocks of the Sayan-Baikal belt and Late Paleozoic\u2013Early Mesozoic accretionary complexes of the Khangai-Daur belt and the basement rocks are covered\/intruded by the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks to form a large-scale igneous rock belt (Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia and Mongolian Academy of Sciences,1998; Tomurtogoo, 2003; Badarch et al., 2002; Kurihara et al., 2008; Onon and Tsukada, 2017) (\nFig. 2).\nThe Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks are classified into the volcanic\u2013clastic rock sequences (i.e., Permian Mogod Formation, Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, and Khanui Group) and plutonic rock complexes (i.e., Permian\u2013Triassic Selenge and Erdenet plutonic rock complexes) (Kepezhinskas and Luchitsky, 1974; Mossakovsky and Tomurtogoo, 1976; Sotnikov et al., 1995, 2005; Izawa and Ohsawa, 2004; Gerel and Munkhtsengel, 2005; Munkhtsengel, 2007; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007; Berzina et al., 2009; Tsukada et al., 2018a; Tsukada et al., 2021) (\nFig. 3). The plutonic rock complexes, embedding substantial quantities of metal ores, have been well-studied mainly from the viewpoint of metallogeny (Khasin et al., 1977; Koval et al., 1989; Gavrilova and Maksimyuk, 1990; Jargalsaihan et al., 1996; Lamb and Cox, 1998; Watanabe and Stein, 2000; Dejidmaa et al., 2002; Berzina et al., 2005). However, no established theory seems to be there to explain the magmagenesis of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks, which offers a key to understand the ancient arc system along the \u201cSiberian continental margin.\u201d\n\nMorozumi (2003) suggested that the Selenge plutonic rock complex has an adakitic nature in the Sr\/Y ratio. In addition, Munkhtsengel et al. (2007) mentioned that the Selenge plutonic rock complex corresponds to adakitic rocks formed at an arc condition. Tsukada et al. (2018a) found that the Upper Permian volcanic rocks of the Tulbur Formation of Khanui Group are adakitic rocks derived from the oceanic slab-melt. As mentioned above, several studies in Permian\u2013Triassic magmatism have been made on the Khanui Group and the Selenge plutonic rock complex; on the other hand, little attention has been given to the Mogod and Bugat\/Baruunburen Formations. In order to clarify the Permian\u2013Triassic magmatism along the \u201cSiberian continental margin,\u201d geochemical investigation of these crucial formations and comparison with the other volcano-plutonic rocks are necessary. This paper describes the lithology and geochemistry of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation at the Jargalant area, Selenge plutonic rock complex at the Erdenet north area, and intermediate dike intruding into these rocks around the Erdenet city, northern Mongolia. It discusses the magmagenesis and subduction system along the Permian\u2013Triassic Siberia\u2013South Mongolian\u2013Bureya continental margin.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks\nMongolia is geologically divided into the northern and southern superblocks by the Main Mongolian lineament (Tomurtogoo, 2003) (Fig. 2). The northern superblock, the southern margin of the \u201cSiberian continent,\u201d is mainly composed of the Late Paleozoic\u2013Early Mesozoic accretionary complexes of the Khangai-Daur belt and the continental affinity of the Sayan-Baikal belt (Petrov et al., 2014; Onon and Tsukada, 2017) (Fig. 2). The Khangai-Daur belt is mainly composed of sandstone and mudstone with subordinate amounts of radiolarian chert, siliceous mudstone, basalts, and limestone (Badarch et al., 2002; Tomurtogoo, 2003; Minjin et al., 2006; Kurihara et al., 2008; Takeuchi et al., 2012; Tsukada et al., 2013; Erdenesaihan et al., 2013; Lkhagvasuren et al., 2020). The belt rocks are in places intruded by Permian\u2013Jurassic granitic rocks (Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia and Mongolian Academy of Sciences, 1998; Tomurtogoo, 2003; Takeuchi et al., 2012). The Sayan-Baikal belt mainly consists of Precambrian\u2013Cambrian metamorphic rocks and limestone, Precambrian\u2013Ordovician granitic rocks, and Silurian\u2013Carboniferous limestone, volcanic rocks, and clastic rocks (Onon and Tsukada, 2017). These rocks are covered\/intruded by the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks, and then are intruded by Mesozoic granitic rocks (Mineral Resource Authority of Mongolia and Mongolian Academy of Sciences, 1998; Tomurtogoo, 2003; Onon and Tsukada, 2017) (Fig. 2).\nThe Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks are divided into the following five geologic units: Lower Permian Mogod Formation, Lower\u2013Upper Permian Khanui Group, Upper Permian Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Late Permian\u2013Middle Triassic Selenge plutonic rock complex, and Permian?\u2013Late Triassic Erdenet plutonic rock complex (Mossakovsky and Tomurtogoo, 1976; Tomurtogoo, 2003; Gerel and Munkhtsengel, 2005; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007; Dejidmaa et al., 2011; Tsukada et al., 2018a; Tsukada et al., 2021) (Fig. 3).\nThe Khanui Group is classified, in ascending order, as the Lower Permian Khustai, Middle Permian Khargana, and Upper Permian Tulbur formations (Amgalan et al., 2017; Tsukada et al., 2018a; Tsukada et al., 2021). The Khanui Group comprises rhyolite, diorite, andesite, basalt, and tuffaceous clastic rocks (Amgalan et al., 2017; Tsukada et al., 2018a). A flora suggesting Cisuralian\u2013Guadalupian was obtained from the felsic volcanic rock formation (e.g., Mossakovsky and Tomurtogoo, 1976) (\nTable 1). Andesite lava of the Tulbur Formation gives a zircon U-Pb age of 256.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009Ma (Tsukada et al., 2018a) (Table 1). The Mogod and Bugat\/Baruunburen formations are mainly composed of intermediate volcanic rocks. The Mogod Formation yields a hornblende K\u2013Ar age of 292.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.1\u2009Ma, and the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation gives zircon U-Pb age of 257.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6\u2009Ma (Tsukada et al., 2021) (Table 1). Although K-Ar ages of 230\u2013195\u2009Ma were obtained from the Bugat Formation (Kepezhinskas and Luchitsky, 1974), it is likely the modified ages due to later alteration (Tsukada et al., 2021) (Table 1). While further chronological confirmation would be necessary for the Mogod Formation which had been correlated to the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation as Triassic\u2013Jurassic formation, in this paper, the Mogod Formation is tentatively regarded as a Lower Permian formation, following Tsukada et al. (2021). The Selenge plutonic rock complex, mainly composed of granitoid and diorite, gives 40Ar\u201339Ar ages of 258\u2013247\u2009Ma and sensitive, high-resolution ion-microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb ages of 250\u2013243\u2009Ma (Gerel and Munkhtsengel, 2005; Sotnikov et al., 2005; Munkhtsengel, 2007; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007) (Table 1). The Erdenet plutonic rock complex shows 253\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009Ma (Rb\u2013Sr age), ca. 235\u2009Ma (40Ar\u201339Ar age), and 246\u2013236\u2009Ma (SHRIMP U-Pb age) (Sotnikov et al., 1995, 2005; Munkhtsengel, 2007; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007b; Berzina et al., 2009).\n\n\n3\nGeological description of the study areas\n\n3.1\nLithology and structure of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation at Jargalant area\nThe study area, Jargalant village, 20\u2009km east of Erdenet city, Mongolia, exposes intermediate volcanic rocks of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation (Amgalan et al., 2017) (\n\nFigs. 4, 5). The rocks of this area, striking northeast and gently dipping south, are further divided into the following two parts in ascending order: (1) lower part (intermediate lava with minor tuff breccia) and (2) upper part (intermediate tuff and tuff breccia with lava intercalations) (Fig. 5).\nThe lava in the lower and upper parts is fine- to coarse-grained and vesicular, and has porphyritic or trachytoid textures and is holocrystalline in places (\nFig. 6a, b). The vesicles, some of which are filled with calcite or chlorite to form amygdules, are elongated to oval shape. The platy joint strikes northeast and dips south by 20\u201350\u00b0, and the elongated vesicles plunge southeast by 0\u201360\u00b0. The lava is partly altered to the extent that some minerals have been replaced by calcite, chlorite, and opaque minerals such as hematite. In the lava showing porphyritic or trachytoid textures, subhedral or euhedral plagioclase, clinopyroxene (Cpx), and hornblende, more than 0.5\u2009mm in major axis, lie in a groundmass composed of smaller plagioclase and interstitial chloritic material (\nFig. 7a, b). Later overgrowth and entrapped inclusions are not recognized at each mineral (Fig. 7b). The coarse lava rarely includes subhedral\/euhedral zircon. The mineral assemblage and texture of the lava are monotonous throughout the study area. The tuff breccia in the upper part includes abundant angular clasts of intermediate volcanic rocks, up to 10\u2009cm in diameter, in a cognate matrix (Fig. 6c). The tuff breccia has clear bedding, striking northeast\u2013southwest, and dips south by 15\u00b0 (Fig. 6d).\nThe rocks of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation are intruded by intermediate dikes (Fig. 6e). The dikes, having clear chilled margin in some places, generally strike northeast and are less than 100\u2009m wide. Numerous veins of calcite, epidote, and chlorite are, in places, developed around the dike. The dikes are composed of subhedral or euhedral plagioclase, Cpx with porphyritic or trachytoid textures same as the lava (Fig. 7c, d). Later overgrowth and entrapped inclusions are not recognized at each mineral (Fig. 7d).\n\n\n3.2\nLithology of the Selenge plutonic rock complex at Erdenet north area\nThe study area broadly exposes medium-grained granodiorite and diorite with a subordinate amount of andesite in the Selenge plutonic rock complex (\nFig. 8). The andesite gradually changes into the diorite and granodiorite to show no distinct boundary. The rocks are mainly composed of euhedral or subhedral plagioclase, potassium feldspar, quartz, and biotite with subordinate amounts of apatite, zircon, and opaque minerals. The granodiorite and diorite commonly include mafic enclaves and sub-vertical joints developed in places (Fig. 6f, g).\nThe rocks of the Selenge plutonic rock complex are intruded by intermediate dikes of andesite and diorite with a clear chilled margin (Fig. 6g, h). The intermediate dike includes the xenolith of granodiorite. The dikes are the mostly same, in mineral assemblage and texture, to that intrudes into the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation.\n\n\n\n4\nWhole-rock and clinopyroxene chemical compositions of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike\n\n4.1\nMethodology\n\n4.1.1\nWhole rock chemical composition\nTwenty-two samples of lava from the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, 21 samples of plutonic rocks from the Selenge plutonic rock complex, and 26 samples from the intermediate dike were examined. Major element composition was determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF; Rigaku Primus II ZSX equipped with Rh X-ray tube, 50\u2009kV, 60\u2009mA) installed at Nagoya University of Japan and Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST). Some trace elements (i.e., Co, Rb, Y, Zr, Nb, and Th) of the Selenge plutonic rock complex and intermediate dike were determined using XRF at MUST. In the XRF analysis, glass beads were prepared by fusing mixtures of 0.5\u2009g of powdered sample with 5.0\u2009g of lithium tetraborate for the major elements and mixtures of 1.5\u2009g of powdered sample with 6.0\u2009g of lithium tetraborate for the trace elements. Calibration was carried out using standard rock samples issued by the Geological Survey of Japan. Analytical precision of major elements was estimated to be <\u20091% for Si and about 3% for other elements, except for CaO, MgO, and Na2O, whose analytical precision is >\u20093% when the measured level is <\u20090.1% (Takebe and Yamamoto, 2003). Trace elements and rare earth elements (REE) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (quadrupole type ICP-MS; Agilent 7700x) installed at Nagoya University, with the method described in Yamamoto et al. (2005). About 30\u2009mg of each sample was digested with a mixed solution of HF-HClO4 (2:1 by volume) at 150\u2009\u2103. After complete evaporation of the acids, 2\u2009ml of 1.7\u2009N-HCl was added to dissolve the cake. The residue was separated by centrifugation at 12,000\u2009rpm with a 2\u2009ml polypropylene tube. The supernatant after centrifugation was transferred to another 10\u2009ml Teflon beaker. The residue was then fused with HF-HClO4 (2:1 by volume) again at 150\u2009\u2103. The fused cake was dissolved with about 2\u2009ml 1.7\u2009N-HCl by mild heating, and the solution was centrifuged at 12,000\u2009rpm. In most cases, no residue was recognized after centrifugation. The HCl solution was evaporated to dryness. The fused cake was re-dissolved in 2% HNO3 solution and determined by ICP-MS. In and Bi were used to trace ICP sensitivities; the In and Bi concentrations were mainly the same throughout the analysis. The oxide generation factor (LnO\/Ln) was determined for each 20-ppb solution and used for REE analytical data correction. In the ICP-MS analysis, the correlation coefficients (R-value) of each element, calculated for five standard samples, were >\u20090.9994. The concentration relative standard deviation of the data was mostly less than 3%. The whole-rock composition of the samples is listed in \n\nTables 2, 3, and 4. It is displayed on variation diagrams for selected elements against SiO2 (\nFig. 9).\n\n\n4.1.2\nClinopyroxene chemical composition\nThe Cpx chemical composition in the samples was determined with a method described by Tsukada (2018) using energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Oxford X-Max) linked with scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-3400\u2009N) at Nagoya University. The total values of each analysis were normalized as 100%, following Tsukada (2018). The analytical precision was estimated to be <\u20095% when the measured level was more than 1\u2009wt%, and <\u200910% when the measured level was less than 1\u2009wt% (Tsukada, 2018). Elements with a concentration of less than 0.5\u2009wt% may not have been detected (Tsukada, 2018).\n\n\n\n4.2\nResults \u2013geochemical description of the samples\n\n4.2.1\nWhole rock chemical composition\nThe data of Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike form a linear trend in the variation diagrams for many elements (Fig. 9). The Al2O3 concentration of all samples is nearly identical as about 17\u2009wt% (Fig. 9, \nTables 2\u20134). The Na2O, K2O, and Rb show an increasing trend, and TiO2, FeO*, MnO, CaO, MgO, CaO, P2O5, Cr, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, and Mb show a decreasing trend against the increase of SiO2 in the variation diagram (Fig. 9). The data from these rocks show almost the same pattern on the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-normalized multi-element concentration diagrams (called \u201cspidergram\u201d from now on), i.e., reducing trend with distinctive negative Nb anomaly (\nFig. 10). The chondrite-normalized REE patterns for all data show a reducing trend, enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREE) (\nFig. 11). Geochemical features of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike are as follows: (1) Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation: SiO2 concentration is 50\u201357\u2009wt% and Na2O +\u2009K2O is 5.4\u20139.6, mostly assigned to basaltic trachy andesite (\nFig. 12, Table 2). The samples have FeO*\u2009\/MgO ratio ranging from 1.8 to 4.0; Mg# (100\u2009\u00d7 Mg \/ (Mg + Fe) calculated on a molar basis using total Fe2+ content) is 31\u201350. The samples have high Sr concentration ranging from 986 to 2309\u2009ppm (avg. 1453\u2009ppm); Sr\/Y ratio is 44\u2013190 (avg. 95); and La\/Yb ratio ranges from 23 to 41. (2) Selenge plutonic rock complex: SiO2 concentration of the samples is 53\u201369\u2009wt%, Na2O +\u2009K2O is 3.7\u20139.4, and plotted near the boundary between alkaline and subalkaline rocks in the (Na2O + K2O) vs. SiO2 diagram (Fig. 12, Table 3); FeO*\u2009\/MgO ratio is from 0.8 to 3.0; and Mg# is 37\u201369. The Sr concentration of the samples is 574\u20132572\u2009ppm (avg. 1157\u2009ppm); Sr\/Y ratio is 50\u2013212 (avg. 92); La\/Yb ratio ranges from 13 to 26. (3) Intermediate dike: SiO2 concentration of the samples is 50\u201359\u2009wt% and Na2O+K2O is 4.1\u20138.4, assigned to basaltic trachy andesite or trachy andesite (Fig. 12, Table 4); FeO*\u2009\/MgO ratio ranges from 0.9 to 7.2; and Mg# is 20\u201367. The samples show high Sr concentration (1080\u20132531\u2009ppm, avg. 1527\u2009ppm), and their Sr\/Y ratio is 70\u2013195 (avg. 100); La\/Yb ratio is 24\u2013100.\n\n\n4.2.2\nCpx chemical composition\nRepresentative mineral compositions of Cpx in the lava of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation and intermediate dike are in \nTable 5. The Cpx is assigned to augite and diopside in the pyroxene quadrilateral diagram (Morimoto, 1988) (\nFig. 13a). The Cpx chemical composition is described below.\n(1) Cpx in the lava of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation\nFeO concentration of the central and marginal parts are 9.2\u2009wt% average (standard diviasion (SD): 0.63\u2009wt%) and 9.8\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.66\u2009wt%) respectively, and those of MgO are 15\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.79\u2009wt%) and 15\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.66\u2009wt%) respectively (Fig. 13b, Table 5). Average Mg# is 0.74 (SD: 0.020) at central part of each crystal, and is 0.74 (SD: 0.018) at marginal part (Fig. 13c, Table 5). CaO is 21\u2009wt% (SD: 0.73\u2009wt%) in the cental and is 20\u2009wt% (SD: 0.49\u2009wt%) in the marginal (Table 5). In all crystals, no specific structures such as zoning and compositional contrast are not appeared within the crystals in back scattered electron and chemical compositional mapping images (\nFig. 14a, b, c, d and 15a). TiO2 ranges from 0.61 to 1.6\u2009wt% (0.98\u2009wt% average), Al2O3 varies from 1.8 to 5.3\u2009wt% (3.4\u2009wt% average), and. Na2O is less than 0.53\u2009wt% (Table 5).\n(2) Cpx in the intermediate dike.\nFeO conentration of the central and marginal parts are 7.9\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.28\u2009wt%) and 8.3\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.34\u2009wt%) respectively, and those of MgO are 15\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.42\u2009wt%) and 14\u2009wt% average (SD: 0.47\u2009wt%) respectively (Fig. 13b, Table 5). Mg# is 0.77 (SD: 0.0090) at central part of each crystal, and is 0.75 (SD: 0.012) at marginal part (Fig. 13c, Table 5). The mean of CaO is 22\u2009wt% (SD: 0.53\u2009wt%) in central, and is 22\u2009wt% (SD: 0.34\u2009wt%) in the marginal (Table 5). There is no variation within each crystal for Mg, Fe, and Ca concentrations and no specipic structures such as zoning and compositional contrast are not appeared within the crystals in back scatterd electron and chemical compositional mapping images (Fig. 14e, f, g, h and 15b). TiO2 ranges from 0.68 to 1.5\u2009wt% (1.1\u2009wt% average), Al2O3 varies from 3.1 to 5.4\u2009wt% (4.2\u2009wt% average), and CaO is 21\u201323\u2009wt%. Na2O is less than 0.45\u2009wt% (Table 5).\n\n\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nDiscrimination of the samples\nThe chemical composition of volcanic rocks gives evidence for the tectonic setting of the volcanic activity, and many diagrams to discriminate igneous rocks have been proposed (e.g., Miyashiro, 1974; Pearce, 1982). In this section, discrimination diagrams are used to discuss the tectonic setting of the rocks from the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike.\nData from the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike are arranged in a straight line in the variation diagrams for many elements. It likely suggests that these three rocks originated from a magma source through a fractionation process, or products as a result of magma-mixing between mafic and felsic magmas (Fig. 9).\nThe spidergrams of the samples show geochemical features similar to those of arc-related igneous rocks, such as enriched large ion lithophile elements and LREE in comparison to high-field strength elements and HREE with a negative Nb anomaly (Gill, 1981; Pearce et al., 2005) (Fig. 10). The majority of the samples are plotted in the calc-alkaline field in the SiO2 vs. FeO*\u2009\/MgO diagram (Miyashiro, 1974) (\n\nFig. 16a). Taking all these lines of evidence into consideration, it can be concluded that the samples are of calc-alkaline rocks, which were formed in a volcanic arc environment. Extremely high Sr concentration and Sr\/Y ratio of the samples correspond to \u201cadakites\u201d (Defant and Drummond, 1990). The adakites are generally characterized by SiO2 >\u200956\u2009wt%, Al2O3 >\u200915\u2009wt%, and Sr >\u2009400\u2009ppm, a high Sr\/Y ratio, and fractionated REE (Defant and Drummond, 1990; Drummond et al., 1996; Martin, 1999). The samples in this study, SiO2 50\u201369\u2009wt% (avg. 56\u2009wt%), Al2O3 15\u201320\u2009wt% (avg. 17\u2009wt%), Sr 574\u20132572\u2009ppm (avg. 1379\u2009ppm), Sr\/Y 44\u2013212 (avg. 96), and La\/Yb 13\u2013100 (avg. 35), have adakitic nature in this aspect. It is supported by examination using Sr\/Y vs. Y and La\/Yb vs. Yb diagrams (Defant and Drummond, 1990; Defant et al., 1991; Moyen, 2009) (Fig. 16b, c). In the (K2O + Na2O) vs. SiO2 diagram, most of data are plotted within the field of the adakite (Zhang et al. 2021) (Fig. 12). Martin (1999) classified adakites into the high silica adakite (HSA) with SiO2 >\u200960\u2009wt% and the low silica adakite (LSA) with SiO2 <\u200960\u2009wt%, and described that their geochemical features are different each other. Many samples of this study are assigned to Martin\u2019s LSA in terms of SiO2 <\u200960\u2009wt%, and most samples are plotted across the LSA and HSA fields in the discrimination diagrams (Martin, 1999) (\nFig. 17). In the Cr\/Ni vs. TiO2 diagram, although the most samples are fall on the LSA field, the trend plots showing is similar to HSA\u2019s one (Fig. 17). Zhang et al. (2021) mentioned that the compositional range of the HSA given by Martin et al. (2005) falls within the initial definition of adakites established by Defant and Drummond (1990), whereas LSA can be termed adakitic rocks, but not strictly adakites. Following Zhang et al. (2021), the examined samples here are called to the \u201cadakitic rocks.\u201d\n\n\n5.2\nMagmagenesis of the examined rocks\nIt is suggested that adakitic magma is generated by partial melting of the subducted oceanic slab (Defant and Drummond, 1990; Rapp, 1995; Sen and Dunn, 1994; Tsuchiya et al., 2007), and various processes during its ascent led to the diversity of the adakitic rocks (Castillo, 2006; Tsuchiya, 2008; Moyen, 2009; Zhang et al., 2021). Besides, an alternative way of the adakitic high Sr\/Y and La\/Y magma generation is proposed as magma-mixing, partial melting of the basaltic continental lower crust, and others (Atherton and Petford, 1993; Guo et al., 2007; Streck et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2021).\nIt is known that an adakitic signature in rocks is produce by some magma-mixing processes at continental crust (Guo et al., 2007; Streck et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2013), and the liner arrangement of the data from the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike in the variation diagrams might implies such magma-mixing.\n\nGuo et al. (2007) considered that the adakitic melts caused by various degrees of partial melting were generated in the lower crust, and the mixing of potassic\u2013ultrapotassic magma with these melts produced a variety of adakitic rocks in southern Tibet after the collision of Indian and Eurasian continents. The trace elements compositions and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope characteristics of the Tibetan adakite are in close agreement with those of both the melt resulting from partial melting of the subducted oceanic plate and that from partial melting of the lower crustal mafic\u2013intermediate rocks. And, Guo et al. (2007) considered the latter as a candidate for the source of the Tibetan adakite on the ground that the subducted oceanic plate was perhaps too cold to cause a melt at the end stage of continent\u2013continent collision. They also mentioned that the heat required to melt the rocks of the lower continental crust could have been supplied by the contemporaneous potassic\u2013ultrapotassic magmas combined with crustal heating induced by lithospheric extension. In the case of Mongolia, unlike the case of Tibet, the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate is considered to have subducted beneath the \u201cSiberian continental margin\u201d in the Late Paleozoic (Kurihara et al., 2008; Bussien et al., 2011; Gordienko et al., 2012; Takeuchi et al., 2012; Onon and Tsukada, 2017). Although there is no concrete data on the stress field of the northern Mongolia around the Permian\u2013Triassic, a compressional field, rather than extensional one, would be expected from the tectonic situation. Indeed, there is no evidence here for lithospheric extension, for example regional normal fault system, graben deposits, back-arc volcanism etc., that would have allowed thermal intrusion into the lower continental crust. Thus, it might not be possible to apply the model proposed by Guo et al. (2007) to the Mongolian case.\n\nStreck et al. (2007) concluded that the adakite-like high-Mg andesite at the Mount Shasta, western coast of US, was formed by mixing of dacitic and basaltic magmas and entrainment of ultramafic crystal material, along with the evidences such as orthopyroxene with high-Mg# rim and entrapped glass inclusions in olivine. And, Zhang et al. (2013) suggested that the adakite-like high-Mg diorites in eastern Dabie orogen, East China is a product resulted as a magma-mixing between the crust-derived granodioritic magma and the differentiation products of mantle-derived gabbronoritic magma with the following evidences. (1) the gabbronorite is usually occurred as enclaves in the high-Mg diorite host, and these are gradually changed each other without sharp boundary. (2) plagioclase phenocrysts in the high-Mg diorite show a strong compositional zoning, i.e. Ca-rich core and Ca-poor rim. (3) The amphibole and biotite in the high-Mg diorite have distinctively higher F concentrations than those in the gabbronorite implying that the high-Mg diorite is a result of mixing of F-rich granodioritic magma and F-poor gabbronoritic magma. (4) In the high-Mg diorites, Cpx is included in amphibole to suggest a reaction between pre-existing Cpx and surrounding hydrous melts causing the amphibole formation. (5) Zircons from the gabbronorite and the diorite are different each other in their morphology, internal texture, Hf isotope, and trace element composition.\nIn the case of this study, evidences positively suggesting the magma-mixing, such as compositional zoning and entrapped glass inclusions in crystals, are not recognized at least in microscopic and SEM observations for 46 samples (Figs. 7, 13, and 14, Table 5). Besides, monotonous chemical composition within Cpx crystals also support this view (Figs. 14 and 15). The intermediate dikes always intrude into the host lava and plutonic rocks with clear boundary, and not appear to have been reacted each other (Fig. 6e, g, and h). Therefore, it is considered unlikely, here, that the samples in this study are the result of magma-mixing.\n\nZhang et al. (2005) classified the adakitic rocks according to their origins into Type 1 (derived from the partial melting of the subducted oceanic slab) and Type 2 (derived from the partial melting of the basaltic lower continental crust). Type 2 adakitic rocks have lower Al2O3 concentration (less than about 16\u2009wt%), higher K2O\/Na2O ratio (about 0.5 or more) than Type 1 reflecting their source composition: the basaltic rocks of the lower continental crust generally have a higher K2O\/Na2O ratio than the oceanic basalt. An examination using K2O\/Na2O vs. Al2O3 diagram highly suggests that the present samples, low K2O\/Na2O ratio (mostly less than 0.6) and high Al2O3 concentration (15\u201320\u2009wt%, avg. 17\u2009wt%), correspond to the Type 1 adakitic rocks (Kamei et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010) (Fig. 16d).\nWhen an adakite magma are produced by various levels of partial melting of an eclogite or garnet amphibolite, a positive correlation would be expected for Sr\/Y and La\/Yb because Sr and La are incompatible whereas Y and Yb are compatible in garnet-bearing and plagioclase-free residues (e.g., Defant and Drummond, 1990; Rapp and Watson, 1995; Moyen, 2009; Liu et al., 2010) (Fig. 16e). Liu et al. (2010), based on geochemical studies of Cretaceous adakitic rocks in central-eastern China, demonstrated that adakitic rocks of oceanic slab-origin and those of lower continental crust-origin show quite different arrays on the Sr\/Y vs. (La\/Yb)N diagram, i.e. the former exhibits much higher Sr\/Y value than the latter for a given (La\/Yb)N value. Such a sharp trend of increasing Sr\/Y ratio of oceanic slab-derived adakitic rocks is unlikely to be caused by plagioclase and garnet fractionation, and it probably reflects the low-temperature alteration of the oceanic slab (Liu et al., 2010). The most data here are plotted in the field of the slab-derived adakitic rocks in the Sr\/Y vs. (La\/Yb)N diagram, and therefore the examined rocks are quite likely of slab-melt origin (Fig. 16e).\nThe continental crust generally has a lower Ce\/Pb than oceanic crust (Sun and McDonough, 1989; Taylor and McLennan, 1985; Rudnick and Gao, 2003). And the altered oceanic crust has a much higher Sr\/La, than the lower continental crust, due to the LREE-depleted N-MORB composition and enrichment of Sr by seawater alteration (Liu et al., 2010). Therefore, the Sr\/La of oceanic slab-derived adakitic rocks tends to be higher than that of lower continental crust-derived adakitic rocks. The present data, characterized by a comparatively wide range of Ce\/Pb ratio and high Sr\/La ratio, imply that partial melting of an altered oceanic slab and contamination of sediments on oceanic crust or continental crustal materials have played a role in the magma-formation (Liu et al., 2010) (Fig. 16f).\nSome magma of adakitic rocks is considered to have been formed accompanying fractional crystallization (Macpherson et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2017). Macpherson et al. (2006) explained that the Pleistocene typical adakitic volcanic rock at the Mindanao Island, Philippines, was not attributed to the subducted slab-melting, but either was produced by fractional crystallization of garnet-bearing assemblage from basaltic arc magma, or was produced by melting of garnet-bearing solidified basalt. They pointed that an important feature of the Mindanao rock is the positive correlation between Dy\/Yb and SiO2 concentration, and chondrite-normalized REE pattern shows an increasing trend from medium to heavy REE in the rocks of which SiO2 concentration is less than 60\u2009wt%. The examined samples, unlike the Mindanao rocks, show negative correlation in Dy\/Yb vs. SiO2 diagram, and show a monotonous decreasing trend from light to heavy REE even in rocks with SiO2 <\u200960\u2009wt% at chondrite-normalized REE pattern (Figs. 11 and 18a). As the data of Mindanao and this study are quite different in behavior of REE, at present, it is more reasonable to suppose that the Mongolian adakitic initial melt was produced by slab-melting as described before, rather than by the fractional crystallization of basaltic arc magma\/melting of solidified basalt as seen in Mindanao.\nIncidentally, it is generally known that adakitic rocks are closely associated with porphyry copper deposits (Thi\u00e9blemont et al., (1997); Sajona and Maury, 1998; Oyarzun et al. 2001; Ballard et al. 2002; Ishihara and Chappell, 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Sun et al. 2011, 2013). Thi\u00e9blemont et al., (1997) noted that 38 of 43 large Au, Ag, Cu, and Mo deposits in the world are associated with adakitic rocks, and Leng et al. (2007) showed that most porphyry copper deposits in China are adakite-related. Ishihara and Chappell (2010) summarized the geochemical characteristics of copper-mineralized granitoids from Chile, Highland Valley (Canada), Erdenet (Mongolia), Dexing (China), Medet (Bulgaria), and Ani (Japan), and suggested that many of porphyry copper deposits are closely related to adakitic rocks originating from melt of oceanic slab which has undergone a hydrothermal alteration at oceanic ridge. They remarked that alteration by S-rich hydrothermal fluids in the ridge increases the S concentration in the comparatively copper-rich MORB, and the partial melting of such altered basalt favors the formation of large-scale porphyry copper deposits including copper sulfide minerals such as chalcocite, chalcopyrite, covellite. Furthermore, Liu et al. (2010) demonstrated, in comparison the Cretaceous ore-bearing and ore-barren high-Mg adakitic rocks in central-eastern China, that the deposits are characteristically occurred in adakitic rocks of slab-melt origin. In terms of whether mineralization is associated, the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks of Mongolia host one of the major porphyry copper deposits in the world, and this fact likely supports the oceanic slab-melt origin for the present samples.\nIt is known that the Mg# in the melt generated by partial melting of MORB is up to 45, and interaction with peridotite increases the Mg# in the melt (Rapp, 1997; Rapp et al., 1999). The Mg# of the present samples is generally higher than that of the experimental slab-melt, and many of them are more than 45 (Rapp et al., 1991; Rapp and Watson, 1995; Sen and Dunn, 1994; Winther and Newton, 1991) (\nFig. 18b). This fact points that the initial magma of the examined rocks interacted with mantle peridotite. That is, the magma of present samples has not been derived from basaltic lower crust-melt, but is highly possible to have been derived from the oceanic slab-melt interacted with mantle peridotite during its rising. The rocks in this study have a higher concentration in Fe, Mg, Cr, Co, and Ni than the adakitic granites of the Kitakami Mountains in Japan, which represent the primitive slab-melt composition (Tsuchiya et al., 1999) (Fig. 10). Such rocks have been reported from some regions, e.g. Aleutian-arc and Kitakami Mountains. For example, Drummond et al. (1996) described Ni-enriched adakitic rocks from the Aleutian-arc, and they attributed it to the interaction between slab-melt and mantle peridotite. Furthermore, adakitic rocks with high Mg, Cr, and Ni concentration, similar to the rocks of this study, exposed at the Kitakami Mountains result from the interaction between the slab-melt and mantle peridotite (Tsuchiya et al., 1999, 2005).\nThe examined samples may correspond to the LSA of Martin (1999). Martin (1999) considered that the LSA was resulted from the melting of mantle peridotite that had been metasomatized by reaction with basaltic slab-melt. While, Tsuchiya et al. (2005) showed that the Ni\/Cr ratio of the modified mantle-melt is smaller than that of the melt produced by slab-melt and mantle interaction. In the Ni-Cr correlation, the present data are not plotted in the field of modified mantle-melt, but appear at or near the mixing line of the mantle and slab melt (Fig. 18c). This suggests that the initial magma of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and the intermediate dike were formed by slab-melting and then interacted with mantle peridotite during its ascent.\nNb and Ta are known to have same incompatibility each other, and are not fractioned during mantle magmatism, but fractioned during crustal processes (Sun and McDonough, 1989; Foley et al., 2002; Xiao et al., 2006). Therefore, Nb\/Ta is likely a good indicator to know the magmatic origin and its contamination at the continental crust. Nb\/Ta of the MORB and primitive mantle is almost constant in 17 (Sun and McDonough, 1989). The Nb\/Ta ratios of the upper and middle continental crusts are 13.4 and 16.5 respectively, and that of the lower crust is 8.3 (Nb\/Ta: 12.4 at total crust in average) (Rudnick and Gao, 2003). Nb\/Ta of the adakite and trondhjemite-tonalite-granodiorite (TTG) melt ranges from 1.5 to 20, and basically have lower Nb\/Ta ratio than the N-MORB and primitive mantle (Sun and McDonough, 1989; Foley et al., 2002). The Zr\/Hf ratios in the N-MORB, primitive mantle, and continental crust are nearly identical, ranging from 33 to 37 (Sun and McDonough, 1989; Foley et al., 2002). In the Nb\/Ta vs. Zr\/Hf plot, the present data are plotted along an array including N-MORB, primitive mantle, and continental crust within the Nb\/Ta range of adakite and TTG (Fig. 18d). This may indicate that upwelling adakitic magma underwent various degrees of continental contamination.\n\n\n5.3\nTectonic implications of the adakitic magmatism\nThe Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation and Selenge plutonic rock complex rocks have a signature of adakitic rocks. Source magma was formed by an interaction between slab-melt and mantle peridotite. The Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation gives zircon U-Pb age of 257.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u2009Ma and the Selenge plutonic rock complex gives 40Ar-39Ar ages of 247\u2013258\u2009Ma and SHRIMP ages of 243\u2013250\u2009Ma (Gerel and Munkhtsengel, 2005; Sotnikov et al., 2005; Munkhtsengel, 2007; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007; Tsukada et al., 2021) (Table 1). Besides, Tsukada et al. (2018a) reported that the intermediate lava of the Tulbur Formation of the Khanui Group, dated as 256.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009Ma by zircon U-Pb method, has almost the same geochemical characteristics as the examined samples (Figs. 10, 11, 12, 16, 18). Furthermore, the rocks of the Khanui Group and Selenge plutonic rock complex exposed around Darkhan city, 250\u2009km northeast of Bulgan city, show a signature of slab-melt-origin adakitic rocks (Tsukada et al., 2018b). Therefore, it is evident that adakitic magmatism caused by subducted slab-melting occurred at the \u201cSiberian continental margin\u201d around 250\u2009Ma.\nThe partial melting of MORB requires a particular condition at 2.0\u2009GPa and 900\u2013950\u2009\u2103, and \u201chot and young (<5\u2009Ma) slab subduction model\u201d is considered to be the best explanation for the generation of Type 1 adakitic magma (Defant and Drummond, 1990; Sen and Dunn, 1994; Rapp and Watson, 1995; Tsuchiya et al., 2007).\n\nOnon and Tsukada (2017) deduced that the Khangai-Daur belt, a Late Paleozoic\u2013Early Mesozoic accretionary complex, is the fossilized remains of the subducted Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate and its cover beneath the \u201cSiberian continent.\u201d The migration time of oceanic plates from ridge\/oceanic islands to trench can be estimated from the fossil record of radiolarian chert in the accretionary complex. The movement of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate from the oceanic island to the trench is inferred to have had taken more than 50 million years based on the radiolarian biostratigraphy of the chert in the Late Paleozoic accretionary complex of the Khangai-Daur belt (Kurihara et al., 2008; Tsukada et al., 2013; Bayart et al., 2022). The subducted oceanic plate underneath the \u201cSiberian continent\u201d at the Late Paleozoic time was old and cold when it reached the trench. Therefore, the generation of initial magma of the Permian\u2013Triassic adakitic rocks was probably the result of melting of cold and old subducted slab, and the \u201cpartial melting of hot and young (<5\u2009Ma) subducted slab\u201d model is incompatible with this case.\nSeveral specific settings, such as flat subduction and oblique subduction, have been proposed to account for the melting of the cold and old slab (Gutcher et al., 2000; Yogodzinski et al., 2001). Gutcher et al. (2000) demonstrated that the flat subduction which causes isobaric heating produces partial melting of the 50 million years old subducted slab, causing a broad adakitic rock belt of 100\u2009km width or more. Permian\u2013Triassic adakitic rocks have been reported from a wide area, covering 200\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009km, including Burgan, Erdenet, and Darkhan in northern Mongolia (Morozumi, 2003; Munkhtsengel et al., 2007; Tsukada et al., 2018a, b) (Figs. 2 and 4). Although it might be possible that the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks correspond to a \u201cbroad adakitic rock belt\u201d attributed to the flat subduction of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate, precise age and geochemical feature of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks are, in many areas, still unclear. Further study on age and geochemistry at the western part of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks is needed for clarification (Fig. 2).\n\nYogodzinski et al. (2001) proposed that oblique subduction and slab tearing along an L-shaped trench result in the melting of cold and old slab according to studies in the Aleutian\u2013Kamchatka region. According to them, oblique subduction and tearing of the slab lead to heat intrusion and slab-melting at the torn edge of the slab. The paleolatitude of the Upper Permian Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation is calculated to be 37.1\u00b0N based on thermal remanent magnetization data presented in Pruner (1987). According to the reconstructed Late Permian continental distribution, the adakitic volcanism had occurred along the L-shaped trench between the eastern margin of the Siberian continent and the northern margin of the South Mongolian\u2013Bureya continent (Ueno, 2006; Metcalfe, 2011; Cleal, 2018) (\nFig. 19a). The shape of the subduction zone along the Siberia\u2013South Mongolian\u2013Bureya continental margin is similar to that of the Aleutian\u2013Kamchatka region. The magma generation of the Permian\u2013Triassic adakitic rocks may also have been related to oblique subduction, like the Aleutian\u2013Kamchatka case (Fig. 19). However, this remains to be confirmed when further data on relative plate motion between the continents and the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate, e.g., moving path of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate based on paleomagnetic data, become available.\nIt is known that the superplume activity that formed the Siberian traps had taken place just behind the volcanic arc at Late Permian (Sobolev et al., 2011) (Fig. 19). Another possible scenario is that the heat supply from the superplume that formed the Siberian traps caused partial melting of the oceanic slab subducted beneath the continental margin (Fig. 19). At present, there is no clear evidence that the heat supply from the superplume played a role in the slab-melting, but it is unlikely that the mantle wedge was completely free from the thermal effects of superplume activity. It might be necessary to examine the cause of the adakitic igneous activity in northern Mongolia concerning the superplume in future studies.\nThe intermediate dike has remarkably similar geochemical characteristics to the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation and Selenge plutonic complex (Figs. 10, 11, 12, 16, 18). This indicates that the adakitic magmatism had lasted after the Early Triassic. The Erdenet plutonic rock complex which is Middle\u2013Late Triassic, the younger igneous rock unit than the Selenge plutonic rock complex, also shows adakitic nature (Munkhtsengel et al., 2007). In addition, Donskaya et al. (2012) presented the Late Triassic adakitic volcanic rocks from the Kataev Formation at the western Transbaikalia, northeastern extension of the Permian\u2013Triassic igneous rocks. The adakitic igneous activity caused the dike, therefore, likely corresponds to the post-Middle Triassic adakitic igneous activity such as the Erdenet plutonic rock complex and the Kataev Formation. The Late Triassic adakitic volcanic-plutonic rocks were also reported from the Erguna massif at northeast China and Middle Gobi volcanic belt of south Mongolia on the South Mongolian block (Li et al., 2017; Sheldrick et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2021) (Figs. 1, 19). Li et al. (2017) mentioned that the Middle Triassic volcanic rocks at the Erguna massif have an affinity to normal arc-type volcanic rocks, but the Late Triassic one is slab-melt-origin adakitic rocks. This might imply that the place of the melting of subducted oceanic plate spread from the Siberian continental margin to the South Mongolian\u2013Bureya continental margin during the Middle to Late Triassic (Figs. 1, 19).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nGeochemical investigations of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, the Selenge plutonic rock complex, and the intermediate dike were carried out in order to clarify the subduction system along the \u201cSiberian continental margin\u201d at Permian\u2013Triassic. As a result, the following points were established.\n\ni.\nData from the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike forming a linear trend in the variation diagrams for many elements imply a single magmatic source for these three rocks.\n\n\nii.\nThe spidergrams of the examined samples show geochemical characteristics similar to the arc-related igneous rocks, and the majority are plotted in the calc-alkaline field in the SiO vs. FeO*\u2009\/MgO diagrams. The conclusion is that the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike are calc-alkaline igneous rocks formed at a volcanic arc environment.\n\n\niii.\nThe samples have an extremely high Sr concentration, Sr\/Y ratio, and fractionated REE, which gives evidence of adakitic rocks.\n\n\niv.\nLow K2O\/Na2O, high Sr\/Y, high La\/Yb, and high Sr\/La ratios point that the magma of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and the intermediate dike was derived from oceanic slab-melt.\n\n\nv.\nHigher concentration of Cr and Ni in the samples than the primitive slab-melt suggests that the magma of the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation, Selenge plutonic rock complex, and intermediate dike resulted from an interaction slab-melt and mantle peridotite. The high Mg# value in many samples supports this view.\n\n\nvi.\nThe fact that Nb\/Ta ratio of the present samples are plotted along an array including N-MORB mantle and continental crust likely suggests that the upwelling adakitic magma had undergone various degrees of contamination within the continental crust.\n\n\nvii.\nThe paleolatitude of the Upper Permian Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation is calculated to 37.1\u00b0\u2009N. Therefore, the Late Permian\u2013Middle Triassic adakitic igneous activity had taken place in the volcanic arc along the Siberian continental margin in the mid-latitude region of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\nviii.\nThe intermediate dike having almost the same geochemical feature as the Bugat\/Baruunburen Formation and Selenge plutonic complex is evidence that the adakitic magmatism lasted till after the Early Triassic.\n\n\n\nIt is generally considered that slab-melting occurs when a young\/hot slab subducts beneath a continent. However, the oceanic plate subducted beneath the \u201cSiberian continent\u201d in the late Paleozoic is considered to be old and cold. Possible explanations for the old\/cold slab-melting include flat subduction, slab tearing due to oblique subduction, and heat supply from the superplume that caused the Siberian traps. In order to clarify this issue, it is necessary to do further research on the movement direction of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate and the Permian\u2013Triassic thermal structure beneath the \u201cSiberian continent.\u201d\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nKanta Umeda: Field research, ICP-MS and XRF analysis, Original-draft preparation.

Its tectonic setting consists of, from west to east, the passive continental margin of the North Atlantic Ocean along Norway, the Caledonian mountain range in Norway and Sweden and the continental intraplate region of the East European Craton (Gregersen et al., 2021). Several deformation zones, mainly through Denmark and the southern Baltic Sea and summarized as the Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ), separate Fennoscandia geologically from the rest of Europe to the south (e.g., Gregersen et al., 2002; Mazur et al., 2015; Artemieva, 2019).\nMajor faults on- and off-shore Western Norway (Sigmond, 2002) \u2013 in addition to major oceanic transform faults \u2013 are evidence of the Cenozoic opening and the spreading of the North Atlantic Ocean since ca. 60\u202fMa ago (see e.g., Torsvik et al., 2002), which is the most recent major tectonic event that affected Fennoscandia. The North Atlantic ridge push force together with forces from the African-European collision initiated complex compressional and extensional evolution leading to a multitude of deformation zones, faults and fractures in all parts of Fennoscandia (Gregersen et al., 2021). Hence, some regions stick out in geoscientific investigations as behaving in a different manner than surrounding areas. An example is southern Norway, which has experienced fast recent uplift perhaps caused or facilitated by removal of the basal part of the cratonic lithosphere mantle (Artemieva, 2019).\nCertainly the dominant and most well-known geodynamic process associated with Fennoscandia is the still ongoing land uplift. An ice sheet of ca. 3\u202fkm thickness at the peak of the last glaciation ca. 20,000 years ago depressed the lithosphere into the viscoelastic mantle. During and after deglaciation, the Earth surface undergoes time-delayed rebound towards an equilibrium state. This process of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is well documented (Ekman, 2009; Steffen and Wu, 2011) and also has a lasting effect on sea-level changes today.\nDespite the ongoing deformation mentioned above, Fennoscandia is considered as a typical low seismicity region. Nonetheless, some large earthquake events (magnitude 5 and higher, see Fig. 1\n) have been documented (Gregersen et al., 2021). In view of this, it is interesting to note that more than a dozen fault scarps some kilometre in length have been identified in northern Fennoscandia (see Fig. 1; Lagerb\u00e4ck and Sundh, 2008; Munier et al., 2020) which show frequent seismic activity in the subsurface (Lindblom et al., 2015), but are apparently not accompanied with motion at the surface (Mantovani and Scherneck, 2013). These faults are known as postglacial or glacially induced faults (GIFs) and thought to have been reactivated at the end of the last glaciation that ended ca. 10,000 years ago (Steffen et al., 2021). They are thus considered to be a legacy of GIA. However, recent investigations point to several phases of activity (Ojala et al., 2018), some as young as only 600 years ago (Olesen et al., 2021a), and therefore the interaction of GIA and intraplate seismicity requires further investigation (Olesen et al., 2021b).\nAnalysis of the processes mentioned above (including plate tectonics, GIA, earthquakes) is facilitated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). In Fennoscandia, dedicated studies with continuous GNSS, largely within a GIA focus, have been pursued for about three decades (Milne et al., 2001; Johansson et al., 2002; Lidberg et al., 2007, 2010; Kierulf et al., 2003, 2013, 2014; Lahtinen et al., 2019). Much of this work has been completed under the BIFROST project (Scherneck et al., 2002). Growing lengths of time-series data and ongoing additions to the number of stations both improve collective signal quality (see e.g., Fig. 7 in Steffen and Wu, 2011).\nVarious regional and local GNSS studies have been performed. Kierulf (2017), for example, investigated neotectonics in Northern Norway with a combination of continuous and campaign GNSS. He found that the Ranafjord area is undergoing east-west crustal spreading and that the uplift gradient is larger than predicted with commonly used GIA models. Sj\u00f6berg et al. (2004) investigated in several campaigns (3 times a year) the 15\u202fkm\u202f\n\u00d7\n\u202f20\u202fkm \u00c4sp\u00f6 GPS deformation network in south-eastern Sweden, which surrounded the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant, with the goal to detect any crustal deformation exceeding (locally) 1\u202fmm\/yr after a few years of repeated observations. Similarly, Nyberg et al. (2013) investigated the area around the Olkiluoto nuclear waste disposal site in Finland with data from biannual GNSS campaigns. Both studies showed quite stable conditions at both sites.\nThe vertical velocity component of Fennoscandian GNSS networks shows a pattern of crustal uplift with the highest rates (\n\u223c\n1\n\u202fcm\/yr in Gulf of Bothnia) generally located in areas of thickest ice during the last glacial period (\n\u223c\n3\n,\n000\n\u202fm\u202f\n\u223c\n\u202f20,000 years ago). This rate of uplift gradually decreases with distance from this maximum. In the so-called forebulge area, i.e. Belgium, the Netherlands, Central Germany, central Poland, south-eastern Lithuania, Belarus and western Russia, the crust is undergoing a small subsidence (Steffen and Wu, 2011; Bogusz et al., 2019). Horizontally, the velocities show north-eastward plate motion of the Eurasian plate. Transformed into a frame that fits the GIA process, the crust is undergoing an outward movement from this maximum to the so-called axis of tilting or zero line or hinge line (the area of no vertical movement) with largest values in mid-distance. This velocity field pattern is typical for a region where an ice sheet has vanished some five to ten thousand years ago, as has been shown with GNSS in North America (e.g., Sella et al., 2007; Simon et al., 2016; Robin et al., 2020).\nBecause of the clear GIA signature, BIFROST results have been used in GIA modelling to identify best-fitting earth models (assuming that the ice sheet chronology is described adequately with a dedicated model) (e.g., Milne et al., 2001, 2004; Steffen and Kaufmann, 2005; Zhao et al., 2012; Kollo et al., 2016). This in turn contributes to the selection of optimal locations for new GNSS stations (Wu et al., 2010). Other applications include the comparison with results of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite mission (e.g., Steffen et al., 2010; van der Wal et al., 2011), the development of land-uplift models (\u00c5gren and Svensson, 2007; Hill et al., 2010; M\u00fcller et al., 2012; Simon et al., 2018), stress and strain analysis (Keiding et al., 2015; Gradmann et al., 2018), as correction of the vertical land motion in sea-level studies (e.g., Santamar\u00eda-G\u00f3mez et al., 2014), and to determine the \n\n\ng\n\u02d9\n\n\n\/\n\n\nh\n\u02d9\n\n\n-ratio in Fennoscandia by comparison to absolute gravity measurements (e.g., Olsson et al., 2019; Bilker-Koivula et al., 2021).\nAlthough many velocity fields for Fennoscandia have been published over the last two decades, the last one under the umbrella of the BIFROST project was provided by Lidberg et al. (2010). The aim of this paper is to provide a new quality-assessed BIFROST velocity field from a densified network of GNSS stations with uncertainties, and additionally model-based GIA and elastic corrections for these Fennoscandian, Baltic and northern Central European stations. The velocities are meant to be used for geoscientific studies on GIA, climate change, neotectonics and\/or hydrological loading.\nThe number of stations is increased from a bit more than 80 in Lidberg et al. (2010) to 164. Especially in Fennoscandia, much more stations are part of our velocity field than in the dataset provided by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, which was used, for example, in the generation of the global GIA GPS data set of Schumacher et al. (2018) or in a global analysis of the contemporary mass change effects on sea-level changes and vertical land motion by Frederikse et al. (2019). For interested users, we add vertical velocities for GNSS stations close to other geodetic infrastructure like tide gauges and absolute and superconducting gravity stations to the network. Compared to previous BIFROST studies, we densify the network especially in Norway, Estonia and Latvia.\nOne must further note that ongoing ice melt as observed in Greenland, Antarctica and smaller glaciers around the world causes a near instantaneous (elastic) response of the crust (Frederikse et al., 2016). The melting rates are nowadays so large that the combined effects can easily exceed 0.5\u202fmm\/yr in the vertical component of GNSS measurements some thousand kilometres away of the source (Simon et al., 2018; Frederikse et al., 2019; Ludwigsen et al., 2020), thus the typical GIA pattern in Fennoscandia is slightly altered. Hence, these effects should be removed before, for example, earth rheology can be determined with commonly used GIA models. We provide elastic corrections for each station due to Atmospheric (ATM) and Non-Tidal Ocean (NTO) loading, recent ice melt of major ice sheets and glaciers as well as hydrological changes dependent on the observational time span of each station. We also add values from a standard but well-fitting GIA model that is in line with previous results for readers that wish to investigate regional or local deformation signals and thus need a GIA signal correction. Finally, we compare our residual signal after removal of the elastic and GIA contributions to the global residual uplift signal provided by Frederikse et al. (2019).\n\n\n2\nGNSS data processing\nThe stations are plotted in Fig. 2\n. We name this set of stations the BIFROST2015 network. These are the same stations listed in Vest\u00f8l et al. (2019) except (i) those rejected by Vest\u00f8l et al. (2019) (DONC, HELC, LILC, PREI, ROAC, TEJH, TNSC) and (ii) those that after further analysis have shown anomalous behaviour (large residuals, motion in other direction than surrounding stations) in one of the horizontal components (FLIC, HAMC, HELG, KOSG, NARC, OPEC, STL0, VIKC). We also analysed around 150 global International GNSS Service (IGS) stations from the IGb08 Core Reference Frame sites (Fig. 2, right). These stations ensure a good connection to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008).\nThe derived GNSS station velocities, presented in the supplementary information, are based on available data for the Nordic area from the period January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2014. Due to a number of instrument upgrades and changes at the stations in the first three years of our processing time span that may have affected our velocity estimates negatively, we decided to provide the velocity field for the period 2000.0 to 2015.0. The solution has been processed in early 2015 and thus included at that time all data available. As part of projects of the Nordic Geodetic Commission (NKG), it was then used for development of a land uplift model (NKG2016LU, Vest\u00f8l et al., 2019) and a velocity field model (NKG_RF19vel, H\u00e4kli et al., 2019). These models are official models to be used at Nordic national mapping authorities, e.g., for national reference frame solutions.\nIn the following, we describe briefly the processing where we compare time-series analysis methods. Special attention is paid to the reference frame realizations and how to develop a global reference frame with maximal regional consistency. In order to assess the effects of snow and ice on the time series, an extra iteration is performed in the time-series analysis to remove data points biased by snow on the antenna. The stability of velocity estimates are examined with a convergence analysis. Detailed information on some of the processing steps can be found in the appendix.\nWe have used the geodetic GPS software package GAMIT (King and Bock, 2003; Herring et al., 2015). The atmospheric zenith delay was estimated with a 2-hourly piece-wise linear model together with a daily troposphere gradient. We have used 10-degree cut-of-elevation, the igs08.atx antenna phase center model, the Vienna Mapping Functions (VMF1) (Boehm et al., 2006) tropospheric mapping function and the FES2004 ocean loading model (Scherneck, 1991; Lyard et al., 2006). Atmospheric tidal loading is included, but not any model for the non-tidal atmospheric loading, nor a model for higher order ionosphere disturbances.\nThe stations are divided in subnetworks of stations in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Baltic countries, Denmark and northern Central Europe, and several densification networks in Norway and Sweden (see Fig. 2). Additionally, approximately 150 global IGS stations were divided in three subnetworks. The different subnetworks were analysed on a daily basis and merged to one combined network including global and regional stations for each day using Global Kalman filter VLBI and GPS analysis program (GLOBK) (Herring et al., 2015). This ensures a good connection to the global reference frame. The results are given in IGb08 realized in a two-step procedure described in Appendix A. The effect of the two-step approach on the rate estimates is included in Section 2.2.\n\n2.1\nTime-series analysis\nThe time series are analysed assuming a combination of white noise and power-law noise where also the spectral index was estimated. In addition, offsets for all antenna and radome changes were included in the time-series analysis as well as offsets where breaks in the time series were obvious after a visual inspection. Outliers were removed in a preliminary analysis using an in-house least-squares adjustment program, before applying the time-series analysis with the Cheetah software (see below). Outliers were removed based on a 3\n\u03c3\n-criteria. For stations heavily affected by snow the time series were cleaned in an extra iteration (see Appendix B). The effect of the extra snow iteration on the rate estimates is included in Section 2.2.\nWe used the software Cheetah (successor of the CATS software, Williams, 2008) in the time-series analysis. Cheetah makes use of the differencing approach described in Bos et al. (2008). The great advantage is a significantly reduced time consumption: while calculations with CATS can take hours Cheetah runs within minutes. However, Cheetah does not include the daily position uncertainties in the time-series analysis while CATS does.\nIn Appendix C results from time-series analysis using different software and noise models are presented and discussed. Generally, choosing another software or noise model results in only very small differences in rate estimates. For most stations, a combination of white noise and power law noise gave lower uncertainties than assuming white noise and flicker noise.\n\n\n2.2\nConvergence analysis\nTo examine the stability of our velocity estimates, we have performed a convergence analysis using solutions from stations established in year 2000 or earlier. Velocities have been computed for each time series, first using only the last 2.5 years of data, then the last 3.0 years of data and then extending the time period by 0.5 years until 15 years of data have been included. The RMS of the differences between the velocities for the shorter period and the velocities for the complete time series (back to 2000-01-01) is calculated for each time span and component:\n\n(1)\n\nRMS\n(\n\u0394\nt\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n=\n1\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nr\ni\n\n(\n\u0394\nt\n)\n\u2212\n\n\n\nr\ni\n\n\n\u00af\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nwhere \n\nr\ni\n\n(\n\u0394\nt\n)\n is the rate for station \ni\n with time series of length \n\u0394\nt\n. \n\n\n\nr\ni\n\n\n\u00af\n\n is the rate for station \ni\n using the complete time series back to 2000-01-01 and \nn\n is the number of stations. This test gives a measure of the stability of the estimated secular rates as function of time-series length.\nThe results are plotted in Fig. 3\na, both for the global solution and the solution using the two-step approach described in Appendix A. We see a clear improvement using the two-step approach especially in the vertical component. For example, for a precision of less than 0.5\u202fmm\/yr, 4.5 years are sufficient with the two-step approach while approximately 5.5 years are necessary using the traditional one-step global realization.\nGNSS stations in a region can have a spatially correlated signal, so-called Common Mode (CM)-signal (Wdowinski et al., 1997). The removal of the CM-signal can reduce noise in time series. The CM-signal could come from the GNSS analysis strategy and from the strategy for reference frame realisation. It could come from mismodelled orbit, clocks or Earth orientation parameters, or unmodelled large-scale hydrology or atmospheric effects. These biases influence the rates estimates especially for shorter time series. The two-step solution removes the CM-signal.\nA convergence analysis for the stations affected by snow is included in Fig. 3b. The effect of the extra iteration described in Appendix B is clearly visible. With the standard time-series analysis, the stations affected by snow need more than eight years to achieve a precision of 0.5\u202fmm\/yr. After using the extra snow iteration these stations give results at about the same level as the rest of the network, i.e. ca. five years of observations are needed.\nNote that these convergence results are relative to the rate for the complete time series of 15 years. To get the uncertainty, the precision from the convergence analysis has to be added in quadrature (square root of the sum of squares) to the uncertainties from the complete time series of 15 years. The mean rate uncertainties for the time series of 15 years are 0.05\u202fmm\/yr, 0.05\u202fmm\/yr and 0.12\u202fmm\/yr, in the east, north and height component, respectively.\n\n\n\n3\nGlobal elastic component for the correction of uplift rates\nDynamic processes such as ice melt and hydrological changes as well as ATM and NTO loading can induce instantaneous deformations (e.g., Dobslaw and Thomas, 2007; Compton et al., 2017). Most notably, ice melt and hydrological changes can affect vertical rates (e.g., Argus et al., 2014; Frederikse et al., 2016, 2019). We consider elastic responses during our observation time span from 2000.0 to 2015.0 and provide corrections for elastic effects due to ATM loading, NTO loading, and loading from changes in hydrology and ice masses for each station in the table in the supplementary information.\nThe ATM and NTO loading signals are downloaded from http:\/\/massloading.net\/ (Petrov and Boy, 2004). The NTO signals are calculated using model MPIOM06 (Dobslaw and Thomas, 2007) and the ATM signals with model GEOS-FPIT provided by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe elastic displacement caused by recent ice melt in Antarctica, Greenland, and global glaciers as well as terrestrial water storage changes is computed based on results derived within the framework ESA CCI project Sea Level Budget Closure (SLBC) (https:\/\/climate.esa.int\/en\/projects\/sea-level-budget-closure, Horwath et al., 2020). Four main contributions are provided as time series of global monthly gridded values with a nominal resolution between 0.5\u202f\n\u00d7\n\u202f0.5 and 1\u202f\n\u00d7\n\u202f1 degrees:\n\n1.\nTWS (Terrestrial Water Storage from the WaterGAP Global Hydrological Model (WGHM), C\u00e1ceres et al., 2020; D\u00f6ll et al., 2003; M\u00fcller Schmied et al., 2016): time series over the period 1992\u20132016 of global gridded data (nominal resolution of 0.5 degree) for four different models in terms of water surface density variation (in mm\/yr) for each cell. The four models are different in terms of irrigation (optimal and 70%) and the forcing method (GPCC monthly vs. CRU TS 3.23 monthly precipitation sums) (see e.g., C\u00e1ceres et al., 2020). We used the average according to recommendation in the SLBC project (Horwath et al., 2020).\n\n\n2.\nGLA (Glaciers from the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM, Maussion et al., 2019)): monthly time series over the period 1992\u20132016 of global gridded data (nominal resolution of 0.5 degree) of one model in terms of mass (in Gt) for each cell.\n\n\n3.\nAIS (Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes from the Gravimetric Mass Balance product \u2013 AIS_GMB): time series over the period 2002\u20132016 of grids (nominal resolution of 1 degree) for the mass changes in terms of surface density (kg\/m\n\n\n2\n\n) derived from GRACE.\n\n\n4.\nGIS (Greenland Ice Sheet mass changes derived from radar altimetry): monthly time series over the period 1992\u20132016 of grids (nominal resolution of 1 degree) for the trend of mass changes in terms of mass rate (Gt\/yr) (Simonsen et al., 2021).\n\nFor more information on each product we refer the reader to the corresponding paper.\nWe converted the gridded data into spherical harmonics (SH) up to maximum degree and order 128. The mass lost by the global land water storage (TWS, ice sheets and glaciers) can be quantified in terms of sea-level equivalent, by assuming, as a starting guess, that the water is spread uniformly across the ocean surface. The mass that is redistributed from the land into the ocean produces a deformation in the gravity field (e.g., Farrell and Clark, 1976), which in turn produces a non-uniform distribution of the water in the ocean. So, in order to properly compute the actual deformation caused by the global changes in the total land water storage we account for its related relative sea-level change. This was done with the code TSec v4, benchmarked in Martinec et al. (2018).\nFrom the resulting deformation we extracted the global uplift deformation field only, with a resolution of about 1 degree. Subsequently, we extracted interpolated values at the position of the GPS stations for the observation time span of each individual GPS station. This information is added for each contribution in the table in the supplementary information. An example for the elastic contribution from 2000.0 to 2015.0 is shown in Fig. 4\n.\nThe error of the elastic contribution can be estimated to be at most 10%. In fact, it is directly related to the total error of the mass loading, which has been computed in the SLBC project (see p. 74 in Horwath et al., 2020). The total mass for the sea-level budget has a total error smaller than 10%. Moreover, the near-field contribution (Scandinavian glaciers and hydrology) to the elastic uplift is minor with respect to the far field contribution (see also Ludwigsen et al., 2020). So, the error on the total mass for the sea-level budget is reflected in the elastic uplift rate.\nWe do not provide a correction for the horizontal velocities as this elastic signal can be considered very small (a factor of 3\u20134 smaller than the vertical component, Samrat et al., 2020) and homogeneous over whole Fennoscandia, so that it is removed in a reference frame transformation.\n\n\n4\nGlacial isostatic adjustment model and reference frame\nA GIA model provides the estimated deformation response of the solid Earth to past changes in surface loading from ice and ocean, through a mathematical combination of an ice-sheet history model with a model describing the interior of the Earth with a set of geometric and rheological parameters. Velocity fields of formerly glaciated areas show a clear sign of GIA (Milne et al., 2001) and they can serve two purposes: First, an ice and rheological model combination can be identified by determining the best fit of the velocities calculated with GIA models to the observations. Second, the velocity field of a GIA model, in turn, can be removed from an observed velocity field to investigate other velocity field contributions, e.g., in sea-level studies. As an example, we use a GIA model based on typically used earth structure in such investigations that fits the 3D velocity field of BIFROST2015 well. We do not perform a search for the best-fitting GIA model in this study as we would like to leave this to the interested community. With the help of our GIA model example we can demonstrate a brief geodynamic analysis of the residual velocity field after removal of the GIA signal from our velocity field.\nA key issue is that ITRF2008 is not appropriate for a comparison of the velocity field to the GIA model. One has to remove the plate-tectonic signal before comparing the horizontal velocities. Depending on the chosen method, this can also affect the vertical component. Johansson et al. (2002), Kierulf et al. (2003, 2013), Lidberg et al. (2007), and Hill et al. (2010) use different strategies to remove the tectonic signal before comparison of the observed velocities with the GIA models. Furthermore the definition of geocenter and scale might skew the comparison between observations and models. In Kierulf et al. (2014) a new approach named the GIA-frame approach was introduced to avoid the problem of plate-tectonic impacts on reference frames in the comparison between observations and GIA models. The core idea is to realize the velocity field in the reference frame implicitly given by the GIA model under consideration, see Appendix D for details.\nFor calculation of the velocities from our GIA model, we use the software ICEAGE (Kaufmann, 2004) that is based on the viscoelastic normal-mode method (Peltier, 1974). It applies a pseudo-spectral approach with a spherical harmonic expansion in the spectral domain truncated at degree 192 (Steffen and Kaufmann, 2005). This results in approximately a 1-degree spatial resolution. Details on the theory implemented in ICEAGE can be found in Kaufmann and Lambeck (2000) and Kaufmann and Lambeck (2002). The software has been successfully applied since the mid-1990s in more than two dozen studies (e.g., Kaufmann and Lambeck, 1997; Kaufmann, 2000; Steffen and Kaufmann, 2005; Steffen et al., 2010; Kierulf et al., 2014; Olsson et al., 2019; Vest\u00f8l et al., 2019).\nThe GIA model consists of a so-called three-layer one-dimensional (1D) compressible, Maxwell-viscoelastic Earth model with a lithospheric thickness of 120\u202fkm, an upper-mantle viscosity of \n7\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n20\n\n\u202fPa\u202fs, and a lower-mantle viscosity of \n2\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n21\n\n\u202fPa\u202fs. The Earth model parameters are in line with previous findings using solely GNSS results for Fennoscandia (see e.g., Milne et al., 2001, 2004; Steffen and Kaufmann, 2005; Bergstrand et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2012; Kierulf et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2014), which showed lithospheric thickness of 93\u2013160\u202fkm (with majority pointing to 120\u202fkm), upper-mantle viscosity in a range of (3.4\u201310)\u202f\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n20\n\n\u202fPa\u202fs, and lower-mantle viscosity of at least \n2\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n10\n21\n\n\u202fPa\u202fs. However, our chosen values may differ to those of GIA models that rely on either geological data (Lambeck et al., 1998, thinner lithosphere and weaker upper-mantle viscosity) or GRACE data (Steffen et al., 2010, thicker lithosphere and weaker upper-mantle viscosity). Note that the results are subject to the applied model of ice load history. Most previous studies use either a version of ANU-ICE (also called RSES) from the group of Kurt Lambeck or a model of the ICE-xG series from the group of Dick Peltier.\nFor ice load history, we use the GLAC1-D Eurasian ice component model 90227, which is the preferred GLAC ice model for Northern Europe as it minimizes the collective misfit to a set of observational constraints, including relative sea-level data, GNSS-derived uplift rates, geologically inferred ice margin location history, and the sea-level rise due to meltwater pulses (Tarasov et al., 2012; Tarasov, 2013; Root et al., 2015; Nordman et al., 2015). From this GIA model, we then calculate the absolute velocity in three dimensions ({N, E, U}_GIA in the table of the supplementary material) for each GNSS station location.The corresponding velocity field is shown in Fig. 5\n.\nThe velrot program of GAMIT is used for transformation of the observed velocity field into the GIA frame of our selected GIA model. First, the vertical component of the observations is corrected for elastic effects. We then apply a rotation and translation with 50% weight on the vertical velocities. This transformation has been found appropriate in the development of the NKG_RF19vel deformation model for Northern Europe (H\u00e4kli et al., 2019).\nThe mean difference of our GIA model to the transformed and elastically corrected 3D velocity field is 0.26 (N) and 0.18\u202fmm\/yr (E) horizontally and 0.45\u202fmm\/yr vertically. Restricting to a subset of 34 long-term observing (up to 15 years) and very stable stations, the mean difference is 0.22 (N) and 0.15\u202fmm\/yr (E) horizontally and 0.32\u202fmm\/yr vertically.\n\n\n5\nResults and discussion\nWe separate this section into a discussion of our elastic correction including comparison to corrections provided in previous studies, the performance of our selected GIA model and a brief analysis of the residual velocity field after elastic and GIA correction.\n\n5.1\nThe effect of elastic correction as a function of observation time span\nCombined elastic effects are corrected as a function of the observation time span of each individual GNSS station. This is necessary because ice melt is not constant over time. For example, ice melt in Greenland and Svalbard was on average much larger in the late 2000s until 2015 than on average during the 15-years period from 2000.0\u20132015.0. Therefore, stations with a long observation time span, i.e. from 2000.0\u20132015.0, have on average smaller corrections than stations with a short observation time span beginning in the late 2000s until 2014, see the table in the supplementary information.\nWe visualize this effect in Fig. 6\n where we compare our correction depending on observation time span (a) with a constant time span (b). For the latter, the pattern of decreasing values from north to south is mirrored by results for the sum of effects (compare to Fig. 4f). A correction using observation time span shows isolated, mainly larger elastic correction. While the difference between these two approaches can be otherwise considered small (at most 0.2\u202fmm\/yr) for 89% of the stations, see histogram above, there are 18 stations with considerable time span effect up to a level of half a millimetre per year. This result contrasts with that of Schumacher et al. (2018), who found no significant time span effect for 98.9% of the stations used in their analysis with more than 3000 stations tested.\nThe elastic correction is at least 0.5\u202fmm\/yr at the GNSS stations considered (Figs. 6, Fig. 7\n and supplementary information). For the majority of stations, the correction is mainly between 0.6 and 1.0\u202fmm\/yr. The largest elastic correction is 1.35\u202fmm\/yr for station ROYC. The uplift signals from ATM and NTO are generally very small for the complete time span of observations from the GNSS sites and often cancel each other, so that a combined contribution of larger than \n\u00b1\n0.1\u202fmm\/yr is rare (only concerns stations BORJ, IRBE, NYB0, PULK, SASS, SIRC, SMID, SULD, TALS, TORX). The largest effect here is for station IRBE with 0.25\u202fmm\/yr. The AIS melting contributes negatively to the elastic budget with \n\u2212\n0.10\u20130.07\u202fmm\/yr, meaning its correction would increase the observed uplift. Correcting changes of the GIS and surrounding glaciers combined reduces the observed uplift instead with 0.3\u20130.6\u202fmm\/yr. Correcting global glacier changes, where ice melt on Svalbard has the largest effect on Northern Europe (see Fig. 4), additionally reduces the observed uplift by ca. 0.2\u20130.5\u202fmm\/yr. Elastic correction due to hydrological changes strongly depends on the observation time span. The longer it is (i.e. larger than 10 years), the smaller is the correction, which is then less than 0.1\u202fmm\/yr and therefore almost negligible. For shorter time spans of only 5 or 6 years, elastic effects from hydrology of more than 0.4\u202fmm\/yr can result for some stations.\nThe magnitude of our elastic correction results agrees with most previous results. Simon et al. (2018) found an elastic contribution of 0.3\u20130.5\u202fmm\/yr for GNSS stations in Fennoscandia, with lower values in the south. However, their time span from 1993\u20132014 is much longer than ours and is not dependent on the observation time span of the stations. The elastic contribution in the 1990s is especially much smaller than in more recent years, hence their average can be expected to be lower compared to our result. Their uncertainties for the elastic contribution are estimated to be less than 0.05\u202fmm\/yr, hence maximum 10% and thus in line with our estimated uncertainties.\n\nLudwigsen et al. (2020), providing a vertical land motion model for the wider Arctic, calculated a total elastic contribution from 2003\u20132015 of ca. 0.4\u202fmm\/yr in Denmark and 0.8\u202fmm\/yr in the northern parts of Fennoscandia, which are larger values than those of Simon et al. (2018) but, due to a comparable time span, much closer to our result. As in our result (see Fig. 4d), Ludwigsen et al. (2020) found a contribution of glacier retreat in the Norwegian mountains to be very local adding 0.1\u20130.2\u202fmm\/yr in the very near field.\n\nSchumacher et al. (2018) used a time span from 2005\u20132014 for calculating an elastic correction, which is between 0.5 and 1\u202fmm\/yr in Fennoscandia (their Fig. 5) and thus agrees with our findings. They used and filtered stations from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) (Blewitt et al., 2018). However, in the Nordic countries the number of stations differs largely between their and our study, and also the time span among our stations differs significantly.\n\nFrederikse et al. (2019) used a different approach to remove the elastic contribution from a global GNSS dataset (also from Blewitt et al., 2018) by converting the contemporary mass signal detected by GRACE from March 2002 to April 2017 into a vertical land motion signal. In Fennoscandia, this signal agrees with our results, again spanning between 0.5 and 1\u202fmm\/yr with lower values for southern stations and higher values for northern stations. Because of their different approach, their uncertainties are partly much larger (up to 50% in Fennoscandia, see their Fig. 8f) than our estimate (max 10% of the signal) or the values provided by Simon et al. (2018).\n\n\n5.2\nThe GIA pattern of the last glaciation \u2013 indications on GNSS velocity field quality and GIA model fit\nThe elastically corrected (in the vertical component only) result is shown in Fig. 8\n. The typical elliptic uplift signature is still clearly visible. The maximum of ca. 9.6\u202fmm\/yr is along the northern Swedish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. From here, uplift is decreasing gradually in all directions. The hinge line can be found south of the Norwegian coast, crossing the northern-most tip of Denmark, the \u00d6resund area and south-western Sweden, touching the northern tip of Poland and then turning NE-ward to the Russian coast at the east of the Gulf of Finland. The forebulge, where the crust subsides, is only slightly traceable because station density is low. Subsidence of more than 1\u202fmm\/yr is observed for the Netherlands and western Central Germany. The zone of maximum subsidence in the forebulge is about 300\u2013500\u202fkm to the south of the hinge line. The horizontal velocity field exhibits the dominating plate-motion pattern from the SW to the NE with values of more than 20\u202fmm\/yr.\nOur maximum uplift of ca. 9.6\u202fmm\/yr is observed at the stations UME0 in Ume\u00e5 and SKE0 in Skellefte\u00e5. This is much lower than the values of 10.3 (SKE0), 14.1 (SKE8 in Skellefte\u00e5) and 13.0\u202fmm\/yr (UME6 in Ume\u00e5) provided by Schumacher et al. (2018), (see Fig. 9\na). Especially their results of SKE8 and UME6 should be treated with caution, as these were very young stations with short time spans at the time the data were processed for the global database. The difference to SKE0 might be related to the different elastic models and time spans considered, and to a small fraction to different reference frames. Values between 9.2 and 9.8\u202fmm\/yr instead are provided by the data-driven GIA models of Simon et al. (2018), (Fig. 9b), which agrees with our GIA model result of about 9.5\u202fmm\/yr (Fig. 9c).\nCompared to the GIA models, the database of Schumacher et al. (2018) additionally exhibits an unusual GIA uplift pattern in Central Europe. While both GIA models generally show subsidence south of the Baltic Sea (Fig. 9), the global GNSS database shows subsidence in the south-western Netherlands, Belgium and southern England. Also, quite high subsidence of almost 1.9\u202fmm\/yr is calculated for Moscow. Such pattern of very high land uplift (more than 11.0\u202fmm\/yr) in the Gulf of Bothnia and no subsidence in northern Central Europe and the southern Baltic countries does not agree to current knowledge of the GIA behaviour in Fennoscandia as supported by many observations and modelling studies (see e.g., Steffen and Wu, 2011). Hence, we recommend that this database should be further filtered or re-analysed before being applied in GIA studies for Fennoscandia.\nIn Fig. 10\n we show our transformed velocity field in the GIA frame. The typical uplift pattern remains with slightly reduced maximum values of now ca. 9.3\u202fmm\/yr for UME0 and SKE0. The hinge line in the west is moved a bit to the south, while in the east it is at about the same position. The horizontal velocities show the expected GIA pattern of outward motion with maxima of a bit less than 2\u202fmm\/yr. Their values in the north and in the south (especially in the forebulge area) are close to zero.\n\n\n5.3\nA velocity field after elastic and GIA correction \u2013 discussion of the residual\nThe GIA pattern agrees visually to the one from our selected GIA model in Fig. 5. This allows analysis of the residual field when the velocity field of the GIA model is removed from the elastically corrected observations. The residual is depicted in Fig. 11\n. As the observations and elastic models have uncertainties, we have masked all vertical rate residuals within \n\u00b1\n0.4\u202fmm\/yr and only discuss values larger than this. Using \n\u00b1\n0.4\u202fmm\/yr also agrees with the mean difference of the GIA model to the elastically corrected observations.\nOverall, most differences in the vertical component away from the Atlantic coast are within this \n\u00b1\n0.4\u202fmm\/yr limit. Residual vertical rates exceeding \n\u00b1\n0.4\u202fmm\/yr are found along most parts of the Norwegian coast and at the western Baltic Sea coast of Finland. In addition, there are a few isolated spots which may point to station outliers or local deformation, e.g., in eastern Denmark. Differences in the horizontals are generally much less than 1\u202fmm\/yr. For many stations, especially in southern Fennoscandia and northern Central Europe, they are negligible.\nThe differences at the western Finnish coast are mainly attributed to two stations in Finland. Here, it is known that growing trees have affected the measurements at these stations (Lahtinen et al., 2019). This has not been considered in our analysis and thus must be taken care of in a future analysis, as done by Lahtinen et al. (2019).\nThe strong differences of more than 1\u202fmm\/yr in central Western Norway may be referred to several different reasons. The anomaly in the Ranafjord area is likely local\/regional neotectonics related to east-west crustal spreading as suggested by Olesen et al. (2013) and Kierulf (2017). Here, Dehls et al. (2002) also observed an irregular subsidence pattern of cax. 1\u202fmm\/yr with DInSAR permanent scatterer data. It is thus very likely that our residual field captures this regional process.\nMoreover, using InSAR, Rouyet et al. (2018) found a subsidence between 1993\u20132000 of approximately 6\u202fmm\/yr around the Storglomvatn reservoir, not far away from Ranafjord. The water level increased by approximately 120 metres during the 1990s. Such small but still visible subsidence was also found for other reservoirs in the world (e.g., Kaufmann and Amelung, 2000; Wang, 2000), and a small visco-elastic relaxation signal may still be detectable with GNSS from 2000-2014. Nowadays the water level of this hydropower plant water reservoir is allowed to vary with \n\u00b1\n60\u202fm. The elastic loading signal decreases with distance to the load. At a distance of 35\u202fkm the estimated associated elastic vertical variation is \n\u00b1\n0.8\u202fmm (Kierulf, 2017). A similar vertical deformation signal can be expected in the vicinity of other hydropower plant water reservoirs (e.g., Steffen and Kaufmann, 2006). Normally the water level in such water reservoir changes in annual cycles and the effect on the rate is insignificant after a few years of observations. However, close to the water reservoirs and in periods where the water level is constantly changing over time, for instance when a new reservoir is filled, the elastic loading can have large effects on the velocity field.\nAlong the Norwegian coastal margin, especially from the south to the Ranafjord area, long-term sedimentary loading effects since the last ice age can alter the velocity field. van der Wal and IJpelaar (2017) analysed different sediment loading scenarios included in GIA models. They found an effect of roughly 0.2\u202fmm\/yr in this area for the vertical component. However, as our residual is negative this would increase our residual rather than explaining it.\nAnother process that could be considered are regional effects of offshore oil and gas extraction that may lead to large-scale subsidence of the surface. However, the majority of fields are at least 50\u202fkm away from the coast, and subsidence occurs rather locally (Hatchell et al., 2007; Eiken et al., 2008). Hence, such influence is unlikely.\nWe do not see eye-catching residuals in the Oslo Graben area which may point to anomalous behaviour there, e.g., a faster uplift than the surrounding. At this point, our results may not help in getting a better understanding of the geodynamic situation there (see e.g., Stratford and Thybo, 2011).\nSome part of the anomaly in Northern Norway might be related to a different loading scenario that affects the elastic correction of our northernmost GNSS stations. Using radar altimetry, Rose et al. (2019) found significant sea-level anomalies of up to 7\u202fmm\/yr at the northern Norwegian coast (observation time span 01\/1996\u201309\/2018), much larger than the global average of ca. 3\u202fmm\/yr. This local above-average loading effect cannot be fully resolved in our elastic correction model and thus may change the residuals there.\nIn turn, the residual field may indicate possible improvements in the GIA model. We use a laterally homogeneous Earth model in the GIA model, but the lithosphere should be much thinner along most parts of the Norwegian coast than in central Fennoscandia (e.g., Steffen and Kaufmann, 2005; Fjeldskaar and Bondevik, 2020). Fjeldskaar and Bondevik (2020) even suggest differences in lithospheric thickness between the northern and southern parts of Norway. In addition, Maystrenko et al. (2020) recently pointed to prominent, low-velocity, and, most likely, thermally anomalous zones in the upper mantle of Western and Northern Norway. If these structures are considered in a laterally heterogeneous GIA model, they could alter the velocity field from the GIA model. The latter could be the case in the northern parts, where the horizontal velocity field exhibits differences of up to 1\u202fmm\/yr southward. If effects from subsurface structures and tectonics can be excluded, another possibility is the improvement of the ice load history model.\nLastly, we compare our residual field to the one provided by Frederikse et al. (2019), see Fig. 12\n. We have limited the residual field by Frederikse et al. (2019) to the area of the official Nordic land uplift model NKG2016LU (Vest\u00f8l et al., 2019) (49\u201375 degrees North, 0\u201350 degrees East). A brief statistical analysis is presented in Fig. 13\n. The residual field of Frederikse et al. (2019) contains about 210 stations more than our dataset, but these are mainly stations in northern Central Europe and the Baltic countries. The spread in the residual is large (almost 14\u202fmm\/yr) with locally very high values of some millimetres per year (Figs. 12b and 13b). Compared to it, our residual field shows only small variation (Figs. 12a and 13a).\nIf stations with values within \n\u00b1\n0.4\u202fmm\/yr are removed (Figs. 12e and f), the residual field of Frederikse et al. (2019) shows cluster regions with uplift (Belgium, Czech Republic, south-western Sweden, Gulf of Bothnia and northern Fennoscandia, Moscow) and subsidence (Baltic countries, Denmark). An interpretation of these clusters, e.g., in a geodynamic sense, is difficult. The subsidence in Denmark and the Baltic countries as well as the uplift in northern Fennoscandia may point to improvements in the GIA model used by Frederikse et al. (2019).\nWe have further limited both datasets to the 60 GNSS stations that are part of each dataset (Figs. 12c and d and 13c and d). With the exception of a few stations in northern Fennoscandia and in Central Europe, the pattern is comparable. Both differences point to possible improvements in the used GIA models. However, we suggest that further filtering of the Frederikse et al. (2019) dataset should be performed to remove some significant outliers in Northern Europe, i.e. those that have residuals exceeding \n\u00b1\n2\u202fmm\/yr (for comparison, 2\u202fmm\/yr is roughly the spread for the 60 stations in our dataset). Such large outliers cannot be confirmed with our dataset nor do we think they are solely related to the GIA model used by Frederikse et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nWe provide quality-assessed 3D velocities including uncertainties for 164 GNSS stations in Northern Europe. After ca. 5 years of observation, velocity estimates converge below 0.5\u202fmm\/yr RMS and allow a robust analysis. The vertical velocities show a clear uplift signal that relates to glacial isostatic adjustment, while horizontal velocities show north-eastward motion of the European plate. When transformed into the reference frame of GIA, the horizontal velocities show a typical pattern of outward motion from the centre of rebound.\nOngoing far field ice melt and regional hydrological changes result in an elastic signal which largely affects the uplift component up to 1\u202fmm\/yr, which can be for some stations, e.g., near the hinge line of GIA, larger than the observed velocity. Based on new and sophisticated models, we provide a correction of this elastic signal together with (small) corrections for atmospheric and non-tidal ocean loading. We calculate elastic effects for each station individually depending on the time span of GNSS observation at each station, so that different periods of accelerated or slowed ice melting can be covered. We have shown that this is especially important when the difference in time spans in a dataset is large.\nWe also list velocities of a selected well-fitting GIA model that can be used to remove the GIA signal from an elastic effects-corrected velocity field. This allows further analysis of the residual velocity signal in view of other geodynamic processes, e.g., tectonics, erosion and sedimentation, and local movements, e.g., due to mining. This could give insight on both the quality of the correction, the accuracy of the models used, and potentially on neglected phenomena with a significant local impact. Our preliminary analysis highlights areas of potential interest such as the central Norwegian coast and northern Fennoscandia, where local environmental or technical\/instrumental effects at the GNSS station can be very likely excluded. We suggest that laterally heterogeneous GIA models should be investigated and eventually considered for Northern Europe, e.g. GIA models that address the apparent lateral variation in lithospheric thickness. Also, improved geodynamic models, either regional ones such as for Western Norway or on a continental scale, can provide possible corrections of the velocity field.\nWe compared our results to other available models and datasets. For some of them we suggest an additional careful quality check as we identified several, large outliers in these models and datasets. We emphasize that a careful quality check seems not yet fully possible with automatized processes that were used in these studies, especially when data are provided on a global scale. Hence, we advise the user to not apply such datasets blindly.\nFinally, we note that even our velocity field still contains known (two stations in Western Finland) and perhaps some unknown outliers. Our residual, especially the vertical component (Figs. 11 and 13a), shows a few stations with values much larger than the estimated error that cannot be explained (yet) with other known processes. These stations need further investigation either on the technical side or regarding local environmental effects. Here, it might be interesting to analyse a GNSS dataset with InSAR measurements and perhaps other ground measurements such as levelling. For example, Gido et al. (2020) determined localized subsidence of up to 6\u202fmm\/yr in the northern parts of the city of G\u00e4vle, Sweden, with levelling and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique. Such local deformation rates should then be used to further correct velocities from possibly affected GNSS stations before usage in large-scale geodynamic studies.\n\n\nAuthor statement\n\nHalfdan Pascal Kierulf: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Visualization\n\nHolger Steffen: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 Original Draft, Visualization\n\nValentina R.

They follow plate movement and are ultimately recycled into the mantle at convergent margins. Subducted or subducting seamounts\/aseismic ridges have been successfully imaged in subduction zones worldwide, such as the Nankai Trough (e.g., Bangs et al., 2006), North-Ecuadorian convergent margin (e.g., Marcaillou et al., 2016), Hikurangi margin (e.g., Barker et al., 2009; Barnes et al., 2010; Pedley et al., 2010), Nicaragua and Costa Rica convergent margin (e.g., McIntosh et al., 2007; Ranero and von Huene, 2000), New Hebrides subduction zone (e.g., Fisher et al., 1991; Collot et al., 1994; Meffre and Crawford, 2001), Sumatra subduction zone (e.g., Singh et al., 2011) and Chilean subduction zone (e.g., Geersen et al., 2015). The subduction of seamounts significantly affects the plate\u2013margin seismicity by potentially enhancing seismic coupling (e.g., Cloos, 1992; Scholz and Small, 1997; McIntosh et al., 2007) or decreasing the degree of coupling and limiting the lateral propagation of megathrust-earthquake rupture planes (e.g., Kodaira et al., 2000, 2006; Park et al., 2003; Wang and Bilek, 2011; Bonnet et al., 2019; Zhou and Xia, 2020). Aside from seismic effects, the subduction of seamounts or other topographic features also plays an important role in the deformation of the overriding plate. Geophysical data, such as multi-channel seismic data, can successfully image the subducted seamounts or aseismic ridges. Nevertheless, owing to intense fracturing of the plate interface during the subduction of seafloor highs and limits in the effective imaging depth of multi-channel seismic surveying, the resolution of seismic data is sometimes insufficient to identify structures within the accretionary wedge (e.g., Collot et al., 1994; Dominguez et al., 1998a; Geersen et al., 2015). Even when seismic data can successfully image the structural patterns of the overriding plate, it can be difficult to differentiate between the seamount subduction-induced features and those that formed prior to seamount subduction. Furthermore, seismic images of seamount subduction only present current interior structures within the accretionary wedge, while the complete evolutionary process of seamount subduction remains enigmatic.\nThe subduction of seamounts\/ridges into an accretionary wedge has been studied by both analogue (e.g., Lallemand et al., 1992, 1994; Dominguez et al., 1998a, b, 2000; Hampel et al., 2004; Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2019; Noda et al., 2020) and numerical modelling (e.g., Baba et al., 2001; Zeumann and Hampel, 2015, 2016; Ding and Lin, 2016; Ruh et al., 2016; Ruh, 2016; Morgan and Bangs, 2017; Jiao et al., 2020). Some important morphological and structural features attributed to seamount or ridge subduction have been observed in these models. Analogue modelling well manifests structural details owing to its high resolution, and some typical structural deformation characteristics (e.g., margin indentation, uplift and subsidence episodes, formation of back-thrust faults, strike-slip faults, out-of-sequence thrust faults, steps in the underlying d\u00e9collement fault) have been well observed in analogue modelling studies (e.g., Lallemand et al., 1992, 1994; Dominguez et al., 1998a,b, 2000; Hampel et al., 2004). In contrast to analogue models, numerical models offer advantages to perform quantitative stress analysis of overriding plate deformation. For example, Ruh et al. (2016) showed that seamount subduction induces a typical stress pattern with large tectonic overpressure and underpressure above the seamount flanks. The maximum shear stress concentrates at both flanks of the seamount, and the seaward flank may be more apt to break than the landward flank at shallow depth (Baba et al., 2001). Two deformation stages of the overriding plate induced by a subducted seamount were calculated in the numerical models of Ding and Lin (2016), where elastic deformation dominated in stage 1 and plastic deformation dominated in stage 2.\nAlthough deformation patterns caused by a single seamount or aseismic ridge have been well studied through both analogue and numerical modelling experiments, the effects of multi-seamount sequential subduction on accretionary wedge deformation have rarely been investigated, especially in cross-sectional view. Almost all the mentioned analogue and numerical models, however, focused on the subduction of a single seamount. An exception is the analogue models by Dominguez et al. (1998b, 2000), which simulated three seamounts simultaneously (i.e., laterally) subducting into the accretionary wedge. However, these seamounts subducted along three different trajectories, not the same trajectory. A detailed study of multiple seamounts (e.g., seamount chains) sequentially subducted into a subduction trajectory therefore remains limited, specifically with regard to evolution processes in cross-sectional view. In this study, we performed a series of analogue modelling experiments to systematically investigate the multi-seamount subduction process and its effects on deformational patterns within an accretionary wedge. Shipboard bathymetry profiles show that seamounts close to the Pacific subduction zones range in height from 1 to 5 km, and have pointed, gently curved or flat tops (Watts et al., 2010). For example, in the Costa Rica margin, seamounts in the Pacific typically have diameters of \u223c 20 km and heights of 2\u20132.5 km (von Huene, 2008). Studies of seamount morphology (Jordan et al., 1983; Smith and Jordan, 1988; Smith, 1988) conclude that a typical seamount shape in Pacific Ocean is closely approximated by a flat-topped cone. The spacing between seamounts in seamount chains varies greatly in nature, from a few to tens to over hundreds of kilometres. Surface deformation and morphology induced by subduction of different shapes of seamounts (conical and flat-topped) has been studied in sandbox experiments (e.g., Dominguez et al., 1998b), however the cross-sectional evolutionary deformation induced by different shapes and sizes is not well known. In this work, different parameters are considered during the experimental modelling, including the shape, size and spacing of the seamounts, as well as rheological properties of the strata between seamounts, because the effect of weak layers entering after the seamounts on the deformation pattern remains unclear, although previous studies indicated that the natural sediments entering a subduction zone may show quite variable mechanical properties (e.g., Kukowski et al., 2002). Finally, we compare our models with a natural case, the Costa Rica margin, to better understand the geodynamic features of seamount subduction and related duplex structures within the accretionary wedge.\n\n\n2\nAnalogue modelling\n\n2.1\nExperimental materials\nDry quartz sand, with a coefficient of internal friction \u03bc of about 0.7\u20130.8 (Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016), behaves similarly to sedimentary rocks in the upper crust (Schellart, 2000; Lohrmann et al., 2003) and has commonly been used as a preferred analogue of natural accretionary wedges (Lallemand et al., 1992, 1994; Dominguez et al., 1998a, b, 2000; Li et al., 2013; Bose et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019). Glass microbeads (\u03bc \u223c 0.5\u20130.6, Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016) are suitable to simulate a strong frictional brittle detachment (Koyi and Vendeville, 2003; Massoli et al., 2006; Bonnet et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013). Silicone putty (PDMS), with Newtonian viscous behaviour under laboratory strain rates (Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986; Weijermars et al., 1993), is a preferred analogue for weak ductile detachments (Cotton and Koyi, 2000; Bonini, 2001; Bahroudi et al., 2003). Independent of strength, frictional and viscous materials behave differently if acting as d\u00e9collement layers, as does the overlying evolving wedge (e.g., Ruh et al., 2012). In all of our models, dry quartz sand was used as an analogue for the accretionary wedge or sediments in the sea basin (Fig. 1\n). To simulate weak horizons within the accreting strata, we present three additional models with different materials on the base in between seamounts (model 6 with a 0.7-cm-thick layer of silicone and models 8 and 9 with glass microbeads) (Fig. 1). The seamounts and ridge were fixed to the bottom of the sandbox and simulated using rigid undeformable argil, which was hardened from plastic argil that was initially wet and moulded into different shapes. After drying at room temperature for \u223c10 h, the shaped argil became rigid, undeformable and fixed in the tank by the strong adhesion between the argil and Plexiglass bottom, as well as the side glass walls.\n\n\n2.2\nExperimental scaling\nAnalogue models should be properly scaled in terms of geometry, kinematics and dynamics with natural prototypes. Dynamical similarity in particular is the key to link models with prototypes (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1981; Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986). Dynamical similarity can be expressed as \u03c3* = \u03c1*g*l* (Weijermars and Schmeling, 1986), where (*) represents the model-to-nature ratio for each parameter, \u03c3 is the stress, \u03c1 is the density, g is the gravitational acceleration and l is the length.\nThe density of quartz sand in the laboratory is about 1350 kg m\u22123, and the average density of natural sedimentary rocks in an accretionary wedge with an average porosity of 30 % is about 2000 kg m\u22123 (Dahlen, 1990). The density ratio \u03c1* is therefore \u223c0.68. The gravitational acceleration ratio g* was 1 in the modelling because both the analogue experiments and natural prototype were under a normal gravitational field. In our models, the linear dimension ratio l* was 10\u22125, where 1 km in nature was simulated by 1 cm in the model. The stress ratio between the laboratory model and nature was \u03c3* = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22126. Shear tests on granular materials such as quartz sand and dry glass microspheres show a similar angle of internal friction with brittle crustal rocks (e.g., Schellart, 2000; Lohrmann et al., 2003). For brittle materials such as dry quartz sand, the cohesion scale is the same as stress because they have the same dimensions (e.g., Cobbold and Jackson, 1992; Schellart and Strak, 2016). The sand layers were paved by pouring the sands from a height of approximately 10 cm and the sand and glass microspheres typically have cohesion values of 20\u2013100 and <20 Pa, respectively (Klinkm\u00fcller et al., 2016), scaling to a few and up to several tens of MPa in nature, similar with the range for natural sedimentary rocks from 10 to 20 MPa (Handin, 1966). More details on the parameters and scaling are listed in Table 1\n.\n\n\n2.3\nExperimental setup\nFive experiments with seamounts\/ridge, as well as a reference experiment (Exp-R) without seamount\/ridge, were built in a transparent Plexiglass sandbox with dimensions of 90 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 30 cm (Fig. 1). To observe the deformation in cross-section, the seamounts\/ridge were paved in two glass sidewalls of the transparent sandbox orthogonal to the accretionary wedge. The glass sidewalls were lubricated using a dehydrated alcoholic solution to diminish frictional effects of the sides. The seamounts\/ridge on the opposite sides did not interact with one another; thus, they represent two independent models (Table 2\n). The models were squeezed from the movable wall to the fixed wall at a constant velocity of 0.02 mm\/s. Three digital cameras were used to take photographs at 1-min interval to monitor the deformation from the top and two sides. Each experiment was run twice to ensure reproducibility. To avoid boundary effects from the movable wall and effectively help the models build an accretionary wedge, a 9-cm-long and 5.5-cm-high proto-wedge was initially constructed for each experiment (Fig. 1). Three sand layers with the same thickness (0.7 cm) were placed in the accretionary wedge formation area (40 cm from the movable wall to the first seamount S1), and two 0.7-cm-thick sand layers were placed seaward from S1 to the fixed wall to simulate the decreased sediments in the sea basin area. Five experiments (models 1\u20139) were conducted by modifying the space between the subducting seamounts, shapes and sizes of the seamounts and rheological properties of the strata between seamounts. The details are listed in Table 2. Exp-R, which had the same setup as Exp-1 but without any seamounts\/ridge, served as a reference model.\n\n\n2.4\nLimitations\nThe effective basal friction coefficients in natural subduction zones are typically very low due to a considerable pore-fluid pressure effects. For the Barbados accretionary wedge, for example, the ratio of pore-fluid to lithostatic pressure, \u03bbb, was estimated to be 0.92 in the Barbados Ridge accretionary complex (Davis et al., 1983). As an average sliding friction \u03bcb of 0.85 for most rocks proposed by Byerlee (1978), the effective coefficient of basal friction could be \u03bcb (1-\u03bbb) = 0.07 in the accretionary wedge. In our sandbox modelling, there were no pore-fluid pressure effects and the basal friction coefficient was about 0.6, inevitably causing a substantially higher slope angle of the wedge than those of natural accretionary wedges. Accordingly, the slope angles of the relief in the experiments were a little exaggerated (37\u00b0-54\u00b0) compared with those average value \u223c17\u00b0 (Smith and Jordan, 1988) or some individual value of \u223c36\u00b0 in the Pacific Ocean (Smith, 1988). Relative higher slope angle of seamounts were also used in previous analogue modelling studies, such as \u223c45\u00b0 or 60\u00b0-70\u00b0 in Lallemand et al., 1994, \u223c25\u00b0-30\u00b0 in Dominguez et al., 2000, \u223c35\u00b0 in Li et al., 2013 and \u223c30\u00b0-40\u00b0 in Noda et al., 2020. Moreover, before the seamount descends into the trench, high angle normal faulting and breakup commonly happens (e.g., Capricorn and Osborne seamounts in the western Pacific, Staudigel and Clague, 2010; Daiichi-Kashima Seamount in the Japan Trench, Kobayashi et al., 1987), which may significantly increase the trench ward slope angles of subducting seamounts. Other features, such as horst and graben structures which usually have a high slope angle are also common on the subducting oceanic plate. Our experiments results may also shed light on the effects of high-angle basement horst subduction on accretionary wedge deformation.\n\n\n\n3\nModelling results\n\n3.1\nExp-R: Deformation of accretionary wedge without basement relief\n\nFig. 2\n shows the cross-sectional and plan views of evolving deformation of Exp-R in eight stages with a maximum shortening of 36.0 cm. When the shortening began, thrust faults formed initially at the seaward edge of the proto-wedge. Overall, the deformation was dominated by numerous landward-dipping thrust faults sequentially propagating seawards in a forward-breaking manner. When a new thrust fault formed in the foreland of the accretionary wedge, the former thrusts became inactive. The newly formed thrust fault absorbed the active shortening (Fig. 2B). The former thrust faults within the wedge rotated passively, as indicated by the increased dipping angle. The wedge grew up gradually in this way with new materials continuously accreted in the front of the wedge. It was found that the thrust spacing gradually narrows after the deformation propagation passed over the initial sediments thickness thinning point (white star in Fig. 2), as the thrust spacing was positively associated with the thickness of sediments (e.g., Zhang et al., 2019). This episodic, in-sequence accretion of thrust sheets acted as a typical evolution of a Coulomb wedge, consistent with previous modelling studies (e.g., Mulugeta, 1988; Sun et al., 2016). At the end of shortening, the thrust wedge reached a taper angle of \u223c12.3\u00b0 (Fig. 2h). For the plan view deformation, in theory, all of the thrusts tracing on the surface of the sand should be straight between the two side glass walls. However, non-cylindrical evolution of curved-surface thrust tracing indicates a certain amount of side-wall friction despite the application of a dehydrated alcoholic solution to lubricate the side walls (Fig. 2A).\n\n\n3.2\nResults of different shapes of subducted highs\nThe shapes of subducted highs were changed in models 2 (ridge), 5 (gently curved seamounts with 10-cm spacing) and 8 (conical seamounts with 10-cm spacing). The seamount size in model 7 was reduced to about half of that in model 5. Fig. 3\n shows the early collision and final stages of all the models in cross-section view. Other cross-section view figures indicating gradual changes of the entire modelling process can be found in the supplementary materials (Figs. S1, S2, S3 and S5B for models 2, 7, 8 and 5, respectively). The deformation stages of these models prior to seamount\/ridge collision were similar (stages a\u2013d) and mostly characterised by forward-breaking imbricate thrust faults. One exception occurred in model 2 where a back thrust fault developed in stage b after 10.6 cm of shortening, constituting a small pop-up in the foreland (stage b in Fig. S1). When the ridge began to collide with the accretionary wedge (stage d in Fig. S1), another small back thrust fault developed. These back thrust faults were only active for a short time before passively rotated above the major basal thrust fault Fo, which thrust over the top of the ridge\/seamounts and extended into the frontal wedge.\nAfter the ridge or seamounts entirely entered into the accretionary wedge, the four models exhibited different deformational features. The major differences were the Fo geometry and the range of duplex structures below Fo. Different shapes of the subducted highs had variable dip angles of the leading flank, which was 37\u00b0 for the gently curved ridge in model 2, 54\u00b0 for the gently curved seamount in model 5 and 7, and 39\u00b0 for the conical seamount in model 8. The dip angle of Fo varied with continuous shortening and early formation stages between the different models with the same shortening are shown in Fig. 3A. It should be noted that although the accretionary wedges did not present exactly the same deformation patterns with the same shortening of 26.4 cm, the overall structures of the wedge were similar. If the subducted ridge\/seamounts had a similar height, the dip angle of the Fo that formed at the early seamount\/ridge collision stage under the same shortening (26.4 cm) showed a positive correlation with that of the leading flank of the subducted highs. For example, the Fo in model 5 had the largest dip angle (19.8\u00b0), followed by models 8 (16.5\u00b0) and 2 (14.5\u00b0) (Fig. 3A). The dip angle of the Fo decreased with decreasing subducted seamount size. In model 7 with seamounts half the size of those in model 5, the Fo dip angle (11.8\u00b0) was considerably smaller than that in model 5 (19.8\u00b0), which indicates that the size (mostly the height) of the subducted seamounts plays an important role in the Fo dip angle. Another remarkable difference is the numbers of thrust sheets within the duplex structure in the footwall of Fo. The modelling results show that the gently curved seamount with high slope angle and height favoured the development of duplex structures at its leading edge. At the final deformation stage with similar shortening, only one thrust sheet developed in the duplex in models 2 and 7, whereas two thrust sheets developed in model 5 (Fig. 3B).\n\n\n3.3\nResults of variable rheologies in sediments between the subducted seamounts\nModels 6, 8 and 9 were set up to evaluate the role of rheology of sediments between the subducted seamounts on deformation. To simulate the weak layers within the accreting strata, a 0.7-cm-thick layer of silicone putty or a 0.7-cm-thick layer of glass microbeads with the same width as the seamounts (3.5 cm) was placed at the base of the strata between seamounts in the models (Fig. 1). Fig. 4\n shows the plan view, including model 5 on the opposite side, and cross-sectional view of the deformation processes for model 6. Before seamount collision, deformation of the accretionary wedge was characterised by imbricated landward-dipping faults but with limited seaward-dipping faults (stages a\u2013d in Fig. 4C), as in previous models including model R in Fig. 2B. The surface traces of the faults were approximately straight from the two sides to the centre of the wedge (stages a\u2013c in Fig. 4A). After the seamount entered into the accretionary wedge, the seamount significantly hindered the seaward propagation of the wedge. These hindering effects appeared at substantially different propagation distances of the front thrust fault between the areas with and without seamounts subduction (stages e\u2013h in Fig. 4A). As the hindering effects enhanced, the deformation laterally propagated from the centre of the wedge into the seamount gap. Fig. 4B is the zoom in view of the representative plan-view deformation area between the two subducted seamounts indicating the lateral propagation behaviour. Owing to the effective d\u00e9collement layer between the seamounts in model 6, the deformation propagated from the centre of the wedge to the sides with little resistance, which resulted in a lateral propagation nearly perpendicular to the wedge compressing direction (Fig. 4B). Comparatively, this lateral propagation was not as apparent in model 5, which had the same setting as model 6 but without a d\u00e9collement layer between seamounts (Fig. 4B). In cross section view, the lateral propagation caused uplift over the original layer between seamounts (stage f in Fig. 4C). These lateral thrust-uplifted sediments were slightly deformed by compressive stress from the hinterland upon the arrival of the Fo tip (stage g in Fig. 4C). After a shortening of 36.0 cm, a basal thrust fault developed between the subducting seamounts and cut through the overlying sediments (stage h in Fig. 4C). Model 5 shows no visible deformation in the strata between seamounts, which means that the thrusts had not laterally propagated into the layers between seamounts. In models 8 (Fig. S3) and 9 (Fig. S4) with a frictional detachment (glass microbeads), the lateral propagation effect was intermediate, i.e. not as intense as that in model 6 but more apparent than that of model 5 without a detachment between seamounts. Some thrust faults with limited displacement nucleated at the centre of the wedge and gradually reached the sidewall. These faults padded the materials into the footwall of Fo and caused a slightly increased Fo dipping angle at the thrust tip (stage g in Fig. S3).\n\n\n\n4\nDiscussion\n\n4.1\nHindering effects of seamounts on accretionary activity\n\n4.1.1\nGeometry of the structures\nTo investigate the effects of seamounts on wedge geometry, all of the models were wetted and cut into transverse sections every 2 cm after the final shortening. The most representative interior geometrical structure (Exp-2) is presented in Fig. 5\n. In areas without seamount subduction (sections e\u2013q in Fig. 5B), imbricate thrust faults developed, which are similar to those in natural normal accretionary prisms (e.g., Yamada et al., 2006). The evolutionary process of natural accretionary wedges is similar to that of model R (Fig. 2), dominated by thrusts faults propagating seawards in an imbricate arrangement.\nHowever, when seamount subduction occurred, the geometry of the wedge entirely changed (sections b and u in Fig. 5B). The most apparent effects are indicated by the slope angle and wedge length (Fig. 5C). When a dry cohesionless sand wedge forms in the sandbox experiments, the theoretical critical taper angle is as follows (Davis et al., 1983):\n\n\n\u03b1\n+\n\u03b2\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\nb\n\n+\n\u03b2\n\n\n1\n+\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\u2009\n\u2248\n\n\nsin\n\u2205\n\n\n1\n-\n\nsin\n\u2205\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nsin\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n+\n\ncos\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nsin\n2\n\n\n\n\u2205\n-\n\n\n\nsin\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncos\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n\n\n-\n\n\ncos\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nsin\n2\n\n\n\n\u2205\n-\n\n\n\nsin\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u2205\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \u03bcb\n is the coefficient of basal friction, \u03d5b\n is the angle of basal friction, \u03d5 is the angle of internal friction of the wedge material and K is a dimensionless quantity. Because the basement in all of the experiments was horizontal, the dip angle of the basal detachment (\u03b2) is zero. Thus, the theoretical critical taper angle can be expressed as:\n\n\n\u03b1\n=\n\n\n\n\u03bc\nb\n\n\n\n1\n+\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy setting \u03bcb=0.6 and the internal friction coefficient tan\u03d5 \u2248 0.75 (Table 1) into the equations above, we obtain K \u2248 2.65 and \u03b1 \u2248 0.16 \u2248 9.3\u00b0.This critical taper angle is slightly lower than the measured one which ranges between 10\u00b0 and 12.5\u00b0 in Fig. 6\n. This discordance may be because of the changing material response during accretion, such as material compaction (e.g., Mulugeta, 1988). The slope angle was nearly 12.5\u00b0 in the central sections of the accretionary wedge without seamount subduction, which is close to its maximum critical taper angle (Fig. 6). In contrast, the slopes with seamount subduction were substantially steeper: reaching 20\u00b0\u201325\u00b0, which is almost double the angle of those without seamount subduction. The subducted seamount forced the basal d\u00e9collement fault Fo to step up into the strata, which increased the frictional resistance (basal vs internal friction) and dip angle of basal detachment \u03b2. This may have modified the critical taper angle of the wedge with seamount subduction and resulted in an increase in slope angle.\nThe variation of wedge length d shows an opposite trend with that of slope angle \u03b1 (Fig. 5C). The maximum length of the deformational wedge without seamount subduction was about 32 cm, whereas in areas with seamount subduction, the propagation distances were substantially smaller. In model 3, the deformational wedge length d was 22\u201323 cm (sections u and t), which was 26\u201328 cm (sections a and b) in model 4 (Fig. 5C). This difference may be due to the different spacings between seamounts (15 cm in model 3 and 5 cm in model 4). The deformation front also passed over two subducted seamounts in model 4 (section b in Fig. 5B), which implies that new accretion occurred in the frontal wedge. However, deformation in model 3 (where the spacing was 15 cm) was blocked by the second subducted seamount (S2) and new sediment accretion did not occur at the S2 trailing edge. We suggest that if the two subducted seamounts are close enough, subduction effects will act as one ridge and new sediment accretion at the wedge toe will occur in the form of lateral propagation.\n\n\n4.1.2\nDeformation propagation\nTo show the variations of deformation propagation with and without seamount subduction during the entire evolution processes, we statistically analysed the deformation propagation distances of Exp-R, Exp-1, Exp-2 and Exp-3 at every 0.6 cm of shortening (Fig. 7\n). The variation of propagation distance in Exp-4 is shown in Supplementary material Fig. S6. The plan view deformation of Exp-R, Exp-1, Exp-2, Exp-3 and Exp-4 is shown in Figs. 2A, S7, S8, 4A and S9, respectively.\nTheoretically, the propagation distance should be consistent along the whole wedge in Exp-R. However, propagation in the central wedge was slightly faster and extended further than that at the two side walls. This resulted from side wall friction, which was impossible to completely eliminate by the application of a lubricant. This friction-induced retardation was about 3\u20135 cm in Exp-R (Fig. 7A). In the seamount subduction models, owing to the hindering effects of seamount, the seaward deformation propagation rate was substantially lower than that in the central areas of the experiment without seamounts. As subduction continued, the gap gradually increased from 8.2 to15.8 cm in Exp-1, 5.9\u201315.5 cm in Exp-2 and 5.5\u201315.1 cm in Exp-3 (Fig. 7). Considering the retardation effect of the side wall (3\u20135 cm, averaging 4.0 cm), the retarded deformation propagation from the initial subduction to the end of shortening should be from 4.2\u201311.8 cm in Exp-1, 1.9\u201311.5 cm in Exp-2 and 1.5\u201311.1 cm in Exp-3. When the seamounts\/ridge began to penetrate into the accretionary wedge, accretionary activity in the front wedge was almost entirely restrained. Comparatively, in the central part of the experiment without seamounts\/ridge subduction, the accretionary activity was not affected (e.g., curves are similar with that of model R in Fig. 7). With continuous seamount subduction, major shortening was mainly absorbed by the ramp-flat fault Fo, which passed over the subducted seamount and propagated seawards in a flat manner. Accretionary activity was not observed at the frontal wedge (Fig. 7), which might be because of the high taper angle. If the taper angle is larger than the critical taper but within the stable domain, the wedge will preferentially slide stably along the basal d\u00e9collement without accretionary activity at the frontal wedge (e.g., Mulugeta, 1988; Liu et al., 1992). At the same time, a steep slope formed at the frontal wedge that may lead to slope destabilization and collapse in response to gravitational instability. This phenomenon was also reported in numerical seamount subduction modelling (Ruh, 2016) and a natural case at the Hikurangi margin (Collot et al., 2001). The frontal wedge area was generally dominated by an under-pressure extensional stress field and gravitational collapse developed (Fig. 9d). Owing to the simultaneous propagation of the Fo and gravitational collapse, the collapsed materials were paved at the Fo footwall, which further favoured the Fo\u2019s horizontal development.\n\n\n\n4.2\nStructural quiet zone and deep duplex structures induced by seamount subduction\n\n4.2.1\nQuiet zone\/stress state\nThe modelling results indicate that deformation of the strata behind the subducted seamount was difficult regardless of spacing between or size of the subducting seamounts, forming a structural quiet zone between the two seamounts (Fig. 8\n\na\u2013d; Fig. S5). The compressive stress was difficult to be transferred into the original strata between the rigid seamounts. The basement-originated thrust fault would pass over the top of the seamounts and extend further into the frontal wedge in a flat manner rather than undercut the strata between seamounts. The collapsed materials above S1 padded over the footwall of the flat thrust fault, which may have prevented deformation of the underlying strata between S1 and S2. The deformation focuses generally on the superficial top layers between the subducted seamounts. However, the modelling results also show an effective way to deform the strata between subducting seamounts by laterally propagated thrusts into the seamount gap (Fig. 8e). When an effective detachment layer exists between subducted seamounts, the lateral extrusion stress can be effectively propagated into the strata between subducted seamounts, causing extra uplifts by lateral propagation. The weak layer may also significantly modify the critical taper angle of the related wedge system, which means that the wedge system has a lower minimum and maximum critical taper angle than those without a weak layer between the seamounts. The surface taper may therefore be stable for wedges with strong d\u00e9collement but is above the maximum critical taper for the weak wedges, resulting in the development of a basal thrust fault between the seamounts. At the same time, apparent thickening caused by thrust faults at the trailing edge of S1 produce high pressure on the basal ductile layer, facilitating seaward flow of the weak layer and development of a new basal thrust fault between S1 and S2 (Fig. 8e). The formation of this thrust fault may attribute to an integrated effect of lateral propagation and gravitational forces of the thick wedge layers. In contrast, for models without a weak layer, the strong basal d\u00e9collement strength between seamounts is similar to the internal wedge strength, considering a friction coefficient of 0.5\u20130.6 for the glass microbeads, \u223c0.6 for the basal Plexiglass and 0.7\u20130.8 for the sand. The similarity between basal and internal strength may result in the Fo overthrusting in a flay way, because it is mechanically easier than cutting downward into the subducting sequence (Figs. 8a\u2013d).\n\n\n4.2.2\nDeep duplex formation\nThe modelling results show that a deep duplex structure develops at the S1 leading edge when S1 is deeply penetrated into the accretionary wedge (Fig. 8). The sediments in front of S1 are transported seawards along with a large displacement low-angle d\u00e9collement thrust fault. Ruh et al. (2016) investigated the complex stress field within and around a subducting seamount by numerical modelling, which provides insights into the formation mechanism of the quiet zone and duplex structure in our models (Fig. 9A). The evolutionary process of the duplex structure resulting from seamount subduction is illustrated in Fig. 9B based on the evolution of model 1. Two structural quiet zones formed at the leading and trailing edges of S1 during the early stage of seamount collision (stage a in Fig. 9B).\nThe angle \u03b8 between the maximum principal stress \u03c31 and fault plane is given by Anderson (1951):\n\n\u03b8 = 45\u00b0- \u03d5\/2\n\nwhere \u03bc=tan \u03d5 = 0.75 in our materials and \u03b8 \u2248 27\u00b0. Because the dip angle of thrust 1 at its nucleation stage is about 15\u00b0, the angle between \u03c31 and the basement should be 12\u00b0 at the thrust 1 formation area. The quiet zone in the leading edge of S1 is disturbed by a newly formed basal thrust fault 2 (stage b in Fig. 9B), because the shear stress along the fault plane surpasses the sand shear strength. In almost all of the models, the basal thrust faults propagated seawards in a flat manner after passing over S1 (e.g., Fig. 8). This may be caused by the angle between the fault plane and \u03c31 being almost equal to \u03b8 at the frontal wedge, resulting in the horizontal direction being the predominant shear direction. The dip angle of thrust fault 2 was about 20\u00b0, larger than that of thrust fault 1, which indicates that \u03c31 rotated anticlockwise by about 5\u00b0.The thrust fault 2 also migrated upwards and seawards above S1 to form a thrust sheet (stage c in Fig. 9B). With continuous shortening, a new basal thrust 3 developed in the footwall of thrust fault 2, forming another thrust sheet (stage d in Fig. 9B). Compared with thrust fault 2, the dip angle of thrust fault 3 increased to 26\u00b0, which means that the angle between \u03c31 and the basement was about 1\u00b0. During the formation of the duplex structure, the direction of \u03c31 in the leading edge of S1 gradually rotated anticlockwise, resulting in an increased dip angle of the thrust faults formed near the seamount. This anticlockwise rotation of \u03c31 was also reported in the numerical models by Ruh et al. (2016) (Fig. 9A).\nThe repeated upward and seaward migration of basal thrust faults (e.g., thrust faults 2 and 3 in Fig. 9) thickens the wedge and results in a supercritical state, i.e. the wedge is mechanically unstable and it will try to regain stability by deforming the frontal wedge. In this case, gravitational collapse with a dip angle of about 40\u00b0 developed at the frontal wedge, thinning the over-thickened wedge and regaining a stable wedge taper. Ruh et al. (2016) stated that seamount subduction could induce a typical stress pattern with large tectonic overpressure above the seamount leading-edge and large underpressure above the seamount trailing-edge. The deformation processes in our models are consistent with this stress field expressed in the numerical models. As the seamount deeply subducted into the accretionary wedge, a compressive zone was trapped by the subducting seamount, and the ongoing shortening made the compressive zone into an overpressured area. The trapped overpressured area may be related with the subducting seamount\u2019s shape and size (Fig. 3). Higher and steeper subducting seamounts will lead to larger overpressured areas and the formation of more thrust sheets in the duplex. Comparatively, owing to the stress block effect of the subducting seamount, the compressive stress can be hardly propagated into the zone at the seamount trailing-edge. A low-pressure structural quiet zone formed at the trailing edge, resulting in the stabilisation of strata between seamounts. At the same time, the overcritical state of the accretionary wedge caused the outermost part of the wedge to collapse (Fig. 9d).\nDuplex structures are common features in accretionary wedges or thrust belts and have been modelled to study their kinematics and dynamics (Graveleau et al., 2012). Previous modelling studies demonstrated that weak layers in the wedge play a major role in duplex formation (e.g., Mugnier et al., 1997; Bonini, 2001; Kukowski et al., 2002; Couzens-Schultz et al., 2003). Kukowski et al. (2002) stated that a weak mid-level detachment combined with strong basal detachment would produce mechanical decoupling and duplex formation. In the analogue models of Couzens-Schultz et al. (2003), two silicone detachments (one at the bottom and the other in the middle of layers) induced duplex formation and the strength of the detachments controlled the duplex styles. Besides, high basal friction can also induce the development of underplating duplex in accretionary wedges (Gutscher et al., 1998). The structural heritage of a wedge subjected to erosion and sedimentation is also a controlling factor of duplex formation in the wedge (Bonnet et al., 2007). Wang et al. (2013) demonstrated that a thick syn-thrusting sedimentation could induce d\u00e9collement formation along an interbedded frictional detachment and basal accretion by duplexing. Based on the results of our analogue models, apart from the controlling factors mentioned above, duplex structures can also be formed in the overpressured zone induced by seamount subduction.\n\n\n\n4.3\nComparison with natural cases\nA natural case that shows the hindering effects of seamount subduction on accretionary activity is the Manila subduction system, where the South China Sea is subducting at the Manila trench. Based on bathymetric and multichannel seismic data, Zhu et al. (2013) studied the accretionary wedge taper along the entire trench in detail and divided the wedge into three segments: the North Luzon Segment, the seamount chain Segment, and the West Luzon Segment. Compared with the area without seamount subduction, the morphology of the seamount chain Segment shows a narrow wedge with steep taper angles (e.g., Fig. 4 in Zhu et al., 2013). We believe that the subduction of seafloor highs (seamounts or ridges) will significantly hinder the seaward accretionary activity and reshape the wedge into a short and steep one. This is in agreement with other modelling works either related to seamount subduction (e.g., Dominguez et al., 2000) or ridge subduction (e.g., Lallemand et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2019). Lallemand et al. (1992) reported specific topographic profiles of accretionary wedges during ridge subduction and suggested that wedge materials migrate from the frontal margin to the distal part, resulting in dramatic variations in the wedge geometry featured with reduced length and increased height.\nThe interior structural deformation features observed in the analogue models show striking similarities with the accretionary wedge of the Costa Rica margin (Fig. 10\n). In the western Costa Rica, the Cocos Plate with an age between late Oligocene and early Miocene is subducting beneath the Caribbean Plate at a rate of \u223c87 mm\/yr and the subduction is almost perpendicular to the margin (McIntosh et al., 1993; McAdoo et al., 1996). Shipley et al. (1992) carried out a 3-D seismic survey on a small part of a prism lying arcwards of the Middle America Trench (MAT) off Costa Rica, showing duplex structures within the prism (Fig. 10b,c). Silver et al. (1985) proposed that duplex formation was a major component of the prism thickening process off Costa Rica. However, the formation mechanism of the duplex was not documented. Our analogue modelling results indicate that basement highs (e.g., seamounts\/ridges, horst block) may play a major role in the formation of duplex structures in the accretionary wedge MAT off Costa Rica (Fig. 9). The duplex structures in the accretionary wedge were probably caused by the underlying basement reliefs, such as ramps (Fig. 10b) or \u201chorst blocks\u201d (Fig. 10c). The leading edge of the subducting seamount in our modelling can be regarded as a basement ramp or horst blocks that results in a step up of the basal main thrust. As the shortening proceeds, new basement-originated thrust faults form in the footwall of the basal main thrust and constitute a duplex. The nature of the \u201chorst block\u201d in Fig. 10c was hard to be precisely defined, because the basement of the oceanic plate was difficult to indentify precisely due to the low resolution of the seismic survey (Shipley et al., 1992). Another seismic line (Fig. 4 in Shipley and Moore, 1986) which was very near the 3D Line 121 in Fig. 10c, showed that horst blocks developed over the basement at about 5 km depth. This may lead us to speculate that the \u201chorst block\u201d in Fig. 10c may be an original oceanic basement structure. However, the \u201chorst block\u201d may also be a competent sediment-related block. In the accretionary wedge off Costa Rica, massive dewatering was implied within the lower part of carbonate-rich sediment sequences beneath the d\u00e9collement, where porosity dramatically decreased due to the compaction. Comparatively, the upper part of sedimentary units were terrigenous, clay-rich sediments (Shipley and Moore, 1986). The relatively more competent lower part of sediments may locally function as a basement horst block and cause the development of overlying duplex structures (Fig. 10c). The duplex structures are formed in the overpressured zone induced by seamount subduction (Fig. 9). This seamount subduction-induced tectonic overpressure area was also the seismogenic zone for earthquakes such as the Mw 6.4 2002 Osa earthquake and its aftershocks (Mart\u00ednez-Loriente et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n5\nConclusion\nWe conducted a series of analogue modelling experiments to simulate the subduction of multiple seamounts. The main conclusions of this study are as follows.\n\n(1)\nSeamount subduction significantly hinders the seaward propagation of the accretionary wedge and facilitates lateral propagation. This hindering effect clearly affects the geometry of the accretionary wedge and leads to a narrow and oversteepened shape.\n\n\n(2)\nTwo structural quiet zones were formed at the leading and trailing edges of the first subducted seamount in the early stage of subduction. However, as the seamount deeply penetrated into the wedge, the structural quiet zone in the leading edge could be disrupted by a duplex structure, which may help to transport deep subducted sediments into the shallow part of the wedge. Comparatively, the structural quiet zone in the trailing edge was difficult to be deformed. Lateral propagation, which can be effectively transmitted by the d\u00e9collement, may play a major role in deforming the strata between the subducting seamounts.\n\n\n(3)\nOur model results shed light on the interior duplex deformation mechanism of the accretionary wedge at the Costa Rica margin. The duplex in the wedge may have resulted from the presence of basement ramps\/relief within the subducting plate.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nChunyang Wang: Conceptualization, Methodology, Data curation, Investigation, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft, Writing - review & editing.

In this context, the Paleogene Eurekan deformation is a major tectonic deformation phase that is directly related to the simultaneous opening of the Baffin Bay\/Labrador seas, the North Atlantic Ocean and the Eurasia Basin (Tessensohn & Piepjohn, 2000; Piepjohn et al., 2016). The Pearya Terrane (Fig. 1\n) located at the northern margin of Ellesmere Island, represents a key element for understanding the geodynamic evolution of the Eurekan deformation. Recently, the geology of the Pearya Terrane was investigated in different studies, with a focus on geochronology and provenance (e.g., Malone, 2012; Hadlari et al., 2014; Dewing et al., 2019). The rift-related Cretaceous magmatism was studied by Estrada & Henjes-Kunst (2013). The faults on Ellesmere Island were analysed in different studies with a focus on the structural style and the fault kinematics (Trettin & Parrish, 1987; Estrada et al., 2006; von Gosen et al., 2012; McClelland et al., 2012; Piepjohn et al. 2008, 2013, 2016; Piepjohn & von Gosen, 2017). The crustal structure of the region has recently been investigated by Stephenson et al. (2017).\nThe Eurekan deformation was a contractional deformation event (Tessensohn & Piepjohn, 2000) that was also characterized by widespread strike-slip tectonics (Piepjohn et al., 2016). It attracted significant attention over the last years. Heron et al. (2015) carried out a numerical modelling study of the Eurekan deformation to explain the distribution of deformation across Ellesmere Island. A comprehensive overview of the Eurekan deformed belt covering Spitsbergen, North Greenland and the Canadian high Arctic was given by Piepjohn et al. (2016). In addition, Gion et al. (2017) presented a plate tectonic model for the Eurekan deformation. The Eurekan deformation took place in two phases (phase 1 between 53-47 Ma and phase 2 between 47-34 Ma) (Piepjohn et al., 2000; Tessensohn & Piepjohn, 2000; Saalmann et al., 2005, 2008; Piepjohn et al., 2016; Gion et al., 2017). Previous work on the Eurekan deformation was also carried out by Lepvrier & Geyssant (1984) and Lepvrier (1990, 1992).\nHowever, there are still open questions regarding the timing and the sequence of strike-slip fault activity, or the nature of the fault zones in the Nares Strait area. Therefore, this study focuses on strike-slip tectonics. We analysed Eurekan strike-slip faults within the western part of the Pearya Terrane and south of it on northern Ellesmere Island (Fig. 1) in order to derive the paleostress field of the region and to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the area.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe northernmost part of Ellesmere Island is named Pearya (Schuchert, 1923) (Fig. 1) and interpreted as a composite terrane (Frisch, 1974; Churkin & Trexler, 1980) that was accreted to the margin of Laurentia in late Silurian times (Trettin, 1987) or in the earliest Carboniferous (Piepjohn et al., 2015). Following Trettin (1987), the Pearya Terrane can be subdivided into four successions (Fig. 1). Succession I represents a Proterozoic crystalline basement complex, composed of amphibolite grade metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, which were intruded by granites (Trettin, 1987; McClelland et al., 2012). Succession II covers carbonates and clastic sedimentary rocks, with minor intercalations of volcanic rocks, cherts and diamictites with depositional ages from Late Proterozoic to Late Cambrian\/Early Ordovician. The Lower to Middle Ordovician Succession III comprises arc-derived volcanic rocks, cherts, mudstones and carbonates. Fault bounded slivers of ultramafic rocks probably represent remnants of ophiolites. Succession IV is an approximately 7-8 km thick unit of late Middle Ordovician to Late Silurian volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Trettin, 1987). Ellesmere Island has been affected by three tectonic events, the M\u2032Clintock Orogeny, the Ellesmerian Orogeny and the Eurekan deformation. The M\u2032Clintock Orogeny of the Pearya Terrane correlates with the Caledonian Orogeny on Svalbard. It took place around 452 Ma (Trettin, 1987) and at that time the translation of the Pearya Terrane toward the north Laurentian margin occurred in the early stages of the Baltica-Laurentia Caledonian collision (McClelland et al., 2012). The Ellesmerian Orogeny produced a large fold-and-thrust belt on Ellesmere Island southeast of the Pearya Terrane (Thorsteinsson & Tozer, 1970; Bj\u00f8rnerud & Bradley, 1994; Piepjohn et al., 2008, 2013, 2015). The sedimentary successions of this area have been investigated by Beranek et al. (2015). Finally, the Eurekan deformation affected the entire area (Piepjohn et al., 2016).\nThe study area is dominated by rocks of Pearya Succession I and II (Fig. 1). The Petersen Bay Fault Zone represents the terrane boundary between the Pearya Terrane in the northwest and the Laurentian Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic Franklinian Basin and the Ellesmerian fold-and-thrust belt in the southeast (Fig. 1) (Trettin & Frisch, 1987, 1996; Klaper, 1992; Estrada et al. 2006; Piepjohn et al. 2013, 2016). Age control exists for magmatic rocks on the Pearya Terrane and the northern part of the Franklinian Basin (Estrada et al., 2006; Estrada & Henjes-Kunst, 2013) and a robust stratigraphic framework is established for the Paleozoic sedimentary units of the Franklinian Basin southeast of the Pearya Terrane (e.g., Trettin, 1987; Dewing et al. 2004, 2008, and citations therein).\n\n\n3\nMethods\nThe data of this study were collected during the CASE 19 expedition of the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in summer 2017 on northern Ellesmere Island (Fig. 1). Altogether 27 outcrops were analysed and in 14 of these outcrops, slickenside orientations were measured with a Freiberg compass. The outcrops cover the major fault zones such as the Petersen Bay Fault Zone (Figs. 2\u20134\n\n\n) and the Emma Fiord Fault Zone as well as minor faults in between. The slickenside measurements were used for fault-slip analyses with the software FaultKin and the P- and T-axes were calculated based on the approach shown in Marrett & Allmendinger (1990). From the P- and T- axis orientations, the directions of paleo-shortening and paleo-extension were derived. Such a paleostress field analysis allows estimating the past stresses that acted in the crust for a certain period of deformation, averaged over the duration of a tectonic event (Lacombe, 2012) and delivers information about the regional tectonic processes (e.g., Delvaux et al., 1997; Saintot and Angelier, 2002).\n\n\n4\nStructural analysis\nIn four of the 27 analysed outcrops (three outcrops south of the Petersen Bay Fault Zone and one outcrop south of the Emma Fiord Fault Zone) fold data comprising fold axes, intersection lineations and the related foliation were measured. In 14 outcrops faults are exposed that delivered the necessary structural information (orientation of the fault surface, orientation and kinematics of the striations) for a fault analysis. Altogether 342 measurements were made (171 value pairs that contain a value for the fault surface orientation and a value for the orientation of the striation). For 155 value pairs it was possible to calculate P- and T-axes (see Table 1\n). There was no significant variation in the measured values at an individual fault in each outcrop, thus we took five to six value pairs at each fault. The outcrop conditions varied throughout the study area. A limited number of strongly weathered outcrops only allowed to take two to three measurements.\n\n\n5\nResults\n\n5.1\nFaults north and south of the Mitchell Point Fault Zone\nThe Mitchell Point Fault Zone is a NE-SW striking major fault zone located within the Pearya Terrane and runs through the central part of the Wootton Peninsula (Fig. 1, 4). In this study outcrops north and south of the Mitchell Point Fault Zone were analysed (see Table 1). Oblique reverse and normal faults occur, as well as right-lateral strike-slip faults are developed at the east coast of the Wootton Peninsula.\n\n\n5.2\nPetersen Bay Fault Zone\nThe Petersen Bay Fault Zone runs across the Wootton Peninsula and the Kulutingwak Fiord and the Yelverton Inlet (Fig. 1). It is the southern boundary of the Pearya Terrane and represents a suture between the exotic Pearya Terrane and Laurentia (e.g., Trettin, 1987; Klaper & Ohta, 1993; Piepjohn et al., 2015) (Fig. 1). Outcrops along the fault zone and in the vicinity of the fault were analysed. At the Petersen Bay Fault Zone indicators for left-lateral strike-slip kinematics dominate (Fig. 2A). The faults strike NNE-SSW to NE-SW. A limited number of NW-SE striking right-lateral strike-slip faults, as well as N-S striking normal faults and steep NE-SW striking reverse faults also occur in the outcrops (Fig. 2, B, C, 3).\n\n\n5.3\nEmma Fiord Fault zone\nThe Emma Fiord Fault Zone is located south of the Pearya Terrane in the Franklinian Basin (Figs. 1,4). Directly within the fault zone, left-lateral strike-slip kinematics dominate. Locally, the fault zone is composed of several strike-slip faults, which form a complex cross-cutting pattern (Fig. 5\n).\n\n\n5\n4 Faults south of the Emma Fiord Fault zone\nTwo outcrops 10 km and 50 km south of the Emma Fiord Fault Zone were analysed (Fig. 4, Table 1). In these outcrops NE-SW striking left-lateral and right-lateral strike-slip faults are exposed.\n\n\n\n6\nInterpretation of the structural elements\nThis study and results from previous studies (Piepjohn et al., 2013; Piepjohn & von Gosen, 2017) show that the NE-SW trending Petersen Bay Fault Zone and the Emma Fiord Fault Zone are major faults dominated by left-lateral movements. There are also sub-parallel right-lateral strike-slip faults developed in the study area like the Mitchell Point Fault Zone (Fig. 4A) (Estrada et al., 2006). From the entire fault pattern and the orientation and position of subordinary faults with respect to the main fault, it can be concluded that some differently oriented, subordinate right-lateral strike-slip faults, as documented, e.g., along the Petersen Bay Fault Zone, most-likely represent anti-Riedel shears to the major left-lateral strike-slip faults (Fig. 3). The Eurekan deformation in the study area is characterized by strike-slip tectonics. The northernmost major reverse fault is the Inlet Head Thrust (Piepjohn & von Gosen 2017). Nevertheless, a limited number of normal faults and reverse faults also occur. These faults are exposed, e.g., on the northern part of the peninsula between the Kulutingwak Fiord and the Yelverton Inlet (Fig. 3A). In this location, three different types of faults are developed (strike-slip, normal and reverse faults) (Fig. 2). For a synopsis, the faults are displayed in one stereographic projection (Fig. 3B). Strike-slip faults are shown in black, yellow, and blue. Normal faults in green and reverse faults in red. The comparison of the fault pattern visualized in Fig. 3B with a conceptual kinematic model for a strike-slip fault zone with the related Riedel shears, anti-Riedel shears and the associated normal and reverse faults (Fig. 3C) (the model is based on Wilcox et al., 1973 and Christie-Blick & Biddle, 1985), shows a clear match of the faults developed in the Petersen Bay Fault Zone (Figs. 2, 3B) to the conceptual model for strike-slip zones. The kinematic relationship between the different faults and their orientation imply that these faults likely represent local structural elements that belong to the same strike-slip system, most-likely formed during one deformation phase (Fig. 3). This is a little bit different to outcrops within the Emma Fiord Fault Zone, where a multiple reactivation of the major faults due to variations in the paleostress field is indicated. Cross-cutting relationships show that first NE-SW striking left-lateral strike-slip faults formed that were offset by ENE-WSW oriented left-lateral strike-slip faults and finally NNE-SSW trending left-lateral strike-slip faults formed (Fig. 5).\nFrom the slickenside datasets, the P- and T-axes were calculated (Fig. 4B) and the paleostress field orientation was derived (Fig. 4C). In the following, we only refer to the orientation of the paleo-compression. Clearly, paleo-extension occurred orthogonal to this direction. The paleostress field has a relatively even geometry, but minor variations from the general trend occur. The fault-slip inversion indicates two major trends in the orientation of the paleostress field (Fig. 4B). One trend represents a N-S compression that shifted over NNE-SSW compression into a NNW-SSE compression. This temporal evolution can be derived from the Emma Fiord Fault Zone (Fig. 5), where first NE-SW oriented left-lateral strike slip faults were formed, followed by more ENE-WSW oriented left-lateral strike-slip faults and finally NNE-SSW trending left-lateral strike-slip faults occurred. The pattern occurs throughout the study area (Fig. 4C), however, the temporal sequence is derived from the cross-cutting relationships, which are only exposed in the area of the Emma Fiord Fault Zone (Fig. 5).\nThe second major paleostress field trend that can be derived, is a WNW-ESE compression (Fig. 4C). This trend is also very constant throughout the entire study area.\nSoutheast of the Petersen Bay Fault Zone, large-scale, NE-SW striking fold structures are developed, which are interpreted as the result of the Ellesmerian Orogeny in the late Paleozoic (e.g., Klaper, 1992; Piepjohn & von Gosen, 2017). The fieldwork carried out so far in this area shows that the occurrence of theses folds is restricted to the area south of the Petersen Bay Fault Zone (Estrada et al., 2006; Piepjohn et al., 2013). In this study we analysed four outcrops with fold structures, where 13 measurements of fold axes and intersection lineations were taken that allow to derive the paleo-shortening in this area. The trend of the analysed fold axes (Fig. 4A) indicates a NW-SE to NNW-SSE compressional stress field in the study area that prevailed throughout the Ellesmerian Orogeny in the Paleozoic (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with previous studies (Piepjohn et al., 2008, 2013, 2017). The large folds and the related slaty cleavage are Ellesmerian structures and they are unconformably overlain by Paleogene deposits further south at the Hazen Plateau (Piepjohn et al. 2008).\n\n\n7\nDiscussion\n\n7.1\nDeformation phases\nAs described above, the paleostress field orientation throughout the study area can be subdivided into three phases: a Paleozoic deformation (NW-SE to NNW-SSE compression), and two Cenozoic phases (a phase with a complex N-S compression followed by WNW-ESE compression) (Fig. 4). The Paleozoic fold structures are the result of the Ellemerian deformation, whereas the Cenozoic strike-slip faults belong to the Eurekan deformation (Piepjohn et al., 2013; Piepjohn & von Gosen, 2017). These two Cenozoic phases are in line with results from Piepjohn et al. (2016), who interpreted the Eurekan deformation as being composed of two phases: a first phase in the early Eocene and a second phase in the late Eocene. Our data indicate that the Eurekan 1 phase was complex and started with N-S compression that subsequently shifted over a NNE-SSW compression into a NNW-SSE compression (Fig. 5). The Eurekan 2 phase is characterized by a simple WNW-ESE compression (Fig. 4B, C). However, it was not possible to resolve the proposed pre-orogenic and post-orogenic phase that was described by Oakey & Chalmers (2012).\n\n\n7.2\nGeodynamic processes and the paleostress field evolution\nThe Eurekan deformation is attributed to motions of Greenland (e.g., De Paor et al., 1989). In this context, Tessensohn & Piepjohn (2000) developed a three phase - model for the Eurekan deformation. In the first phase, Greenland moved northeastward, and in the second phase, northward movements of Greenland occurred. Subsequently, the Fram Strait opened during the third phase. This model was refined by Piepjohn et al. (2016). During Eurekan phase 1, Greenland moved northward, whereas during Eurekan phase 2 Greenland moved to the WNW (Piepjohn et al., 2016). These directions are reflected by the stress directions that were derived from the slickenside data sets in this study (Fig. 4B, C). During Eurekan phase 1, when the Greenland Plate moved northward, the paleostress field was characterized by a N-S compression that shifted over a NNE-SSW compression into a NNW-SSE compression (Fig. 5, 6A). This is derived from the Emma Fiord Fault Zone, where cross-cutting relationships give evidence for this shift of deformation. During Eurekan phase 2, when the plate vector of Greenland changed and the plate motion was WNW-ward, WNW-ESE compression dominated the area (Fig. 6\nB). This shows that the paleostress field of northern Ellesmere Island reflects the motions of the Greenland Plate and implies a strong coupling across the Nares Strait that accounts for an effective stress transfer during the Eocene. This observation is supported by the rheology of the lithosphere. Heron et al. (2015) concluded from numerical simulations that the deformed Hazen Stable Block (Fig. 6) has a rather high strength. This may have enhanced the stress transfer into northern Ellesmere Island and would explain the distinct paleostress field that reflects the motion of the Greenland Plate.\n\n\n7.3\nFault reactivation and timing of deformation\nIt is common that pre-existing faults undergo a reactivation (e.g., Sibson, 1985). For Andersonian faults, the reactivation potential is strongly controlled by the orientation of the pre-existing fault to the applied principal stresses. The angle between the largest principal stress \u03c31 and the fault is named \u03b8. If \u03b8 is around 30\u00b0 the fault is optimally oriented and can be reactivated. The reactivation potential decreases with an increase of \u03b8. For 2\u03b8 no reactivation is possible (Sibson, 1985). In this study we use the P- and T-axes method for the paleostress field analysis, based on the approach of Marrett & Allmendinger (1990). The P- and T-axes may, but do not have to match with the principal stresses \u03c31 and \u03c33 (Allmendinger, 1989). According to Allmendinger (1989), in a P-T-plot, \u03c31 is located within the P-quadrant and \u03c33 in the T-quadrant and provides a reliable indication for the paleostress field. In case of co-axial deformation, the P- and T-axes coincide with the principal stress axes (Peresson & Decker, 1997). Therefore, the orientations of the P- and T-axes with respect to the fault plane, deliver a suitable proxy for the fault reactivation potential.\nMany of the Eurekan faults along the southeastern boundary and southeast of the Pearya Terrane (Fig. 1) are interpreted as reactivated Ellemerian structures (Piepjohn et al., 2013). On Fig. 4C, the direction of compression during the Ellesmerian Orogeny (black arrows) is shown, based on fold axis orientations measured in the field (Fig. 4A). The Ellesmerian paleostress field was NW-SE to NNW-SSE oriented, which can have produced NE-SW striking reverse faults and thrusts (Fig. 7\nA). Data from the Emma Fiord Fault Zone implies that such NE-SW trending faults could have been later reactivated as left-lateral strike-slip faults during the NNE-SSW directed Eurekan phase 1 compression (Fig. 7B), when the angle between the P-axis and the fault plane was about 44\u00b0. The possible subsequent shift of the paleostress field into a NNW-SSE compression could have stopped the activity of these faults (Fig. 7B).\nLeft-lateral strike-slip kinematics dominate at the NE-SW-striking major faults, e.g., at the Petersen Bay Fault Zone (Fig. 2) and the Emma Fiord Fault Zone. Major NW-SE striking faults are not developed. Some minor NW-SE-striking right-lateral strike-slip faults represent anti-Riedel shears of the major NE-SW left-lateral strike-slip faults (Fig. 3). However, also the major NE-SW faults show right-lateral kinematics, like the Mitchell Point Fault Zone, the Petersen Bay Fault Zone and the Emma Fiord Fault Zone (Estrada et al., 2006; Piepjohn et al., 2013), and it has been previously postulated that the left-lateral strike-slip faults represent the first phase of movements and the right-lateral strike-slip faults represent the second phase of movements during the Eurekan deformation (Piepjohn et al., 2016). This hypothesis is supported by the paleostress field analysis of this study (Fig. 4). As described above, the paleostress field can be subdivided into two phase stages, the Eurekan phase 1 and phase 2 deformation. Pre-existing NE-SW Ellesmerian faults were prone for left-lateral slip under NNE-SSW compression that prevailed during the Eurekan phase 1 (Fig. 7B). When the stress field shifted into NNW-SSE compression, fault activity stopped. Right-lateral movements were likely possible later along these faults under a WNW-ESE compression that acted during Eurekan phase 2 (Fig. 7C). In this case, the angle between the P-axis and the fault plane was again in the range of 44\u00b0 that allowed a reactivation. This implies that the left-lateral fault activity was likely older than the right-lateral fault activity and supports the assumption that the Eurekan phase 1 deformation is characterized by left-lateral strike-slip faults, whereas during Eurekan phase 2 the majority of right-lateral strike-slip faults formed.\n\n\n7.4\nRecent seismicity\nIn 1998 an earthquake was recorded in the study area with a magnitude of 4.3 (Bent & Perry, 1999). The calculated epicenter was located south of the Emma Fiord Fault Zone (Fig. 4C). Another seismic event with a magnitude of 3.9 took place in 2001 (https:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov). The epicenter of this earthquake was very close to the Petersen Bay Fault Zone (Fig. 4C). The fault plane solution of the 1998 earthquake shown in Bent & Perry (1999), indicates strike-slip kinematics with a normal fault component related either to a steep NNE-SSW striking fault or a slightly less steep dipping WNW-ESE striking fault surface (Fig. 4C). From the field data it is evident that oblique faulting with a strike-slip component was characteristic for the Eurekan deformation phase in the Paleogene. The fault plane solution of the M4.3 earthquake also shows oblique strike-slip kinematics. This implies that strike-slip fault activity still occurs in this area, today. From the fault plane solution, a recent stress field can be derived, which is characterized by NNW-SSE compression. The epicenter location of the 2001 earthquake close to the Petersen Bay Fault Zone, indicates that this major fault zone experienced activity over the last 350 Myr (Ellesmerian, Eurekan and Recent). Though the database of the recent seismicity is very limited so far, it allows to derive that individual faults on northern Ellesmere Island are still active or undergo a reactivation. The recent earthquakes indicate that some of the Eurekan faults are optimally oriented for a reactivation under the current regional stress field. However, there is the possibility that the fault activity might be also related to stress field changes that are caused by the volume loss of glaciers. Different studies show that the glaciers in the Canadian Arctic have a negative balance and undergo a volume loss (Koerner, 2005; Fisher et al., 2012; White & Copland, 2019). Changes in the ice thickness produce significant stress changes in the lithosphere and thus can have an influence on the seismicity (Cohen, 1993). This effect has been, e.g., documented for glaciers in Alaska (Doser et al., 2007; Masih, 2018).\nThis study supports the previous assumption that the Eurekan deformation was a complex tectonic event, which was controlled by the three ocean system (Labrador Sea \u2013 Baffin Bay, North Atlantic and Eurasian Basin) around the Greenland Plate (e.g., Piepjohn et al., 2016). Our structural data set shows that the Eurekan phase 1 was characterized by N-S compression that shifted to NNE-SSW compression and later to NNW-SSE compression. We do not treat these variations in the shortening direction as separate phases, because the directions of compression are not significantly different. Nevertheless, they might represent some minor changes in movement of the Greenland Plate, but this remains speculative. The fact that the movement of the Greenland Plate was manifested in the structural elements of northern Ellesmere Island implies a strong coupling between Greenland and Ellesmere Island.\n\n\n7.5\nLimitations of the analyses\nThe applied kinematic analysis of the fault data was performed with the approach of Marrett & Allmendinger (1990), which is very robust. The concept behind a fault-slip analysis is the Wallace-Bott hypothesis, which means that the slip along a fault occurs parallel to the maximum resolved shear stress on the fault surface (Wallace, 1951; Bott, 1959). The Wallace-Bott hypothesis requires that the faults are planar, the fault blocks behave rigidly, the applied stress is uniform and no stress perturbations and block rotations occur along the fault surface (Pascal, 2002). We assume that these requirements are fulfilled for the analysed outcrops. However, there are always additional uncertainties that arise from a post-fault rotation of the outcrops, the sampling strategy and the spatial homogeneity of the strain (Marrett & Allmendinger, 1990). The logistics and the outcrop conditions only allowed to take a limited number of measurements for each fault surface. Nevertheless, these measurements are representative and reflect the kinematics of the faults. It has been shown that stress inversion techniques are valid, if the slip direction is controlled by the orientation of the fault surface and a homogeneous regional stress field (Pollard et al., 1993). The results imply that the paleostress field was homogenous (Fig. 4C). The consistent orientation of the paleostress field throughout the study area (Fig. 4C) indicates that the data set is robust and the related derivations are rational.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions\nThe paleostress field based on fold axes and slickenside data shows that the study area was affected by at least three tectonic deformation phases, 1) the Ellesmerian (NW-SE compression), the Eurekan phase 1 (left-lateral strike-slip faulting\/N-S compression) and the Eurekan phase 2 (right-lateral strike-slip faulting\/WNW-ESE compression). The deformation of northern Ellesmere Island is largely controlled by the northwestward stress transfer from the Greenland Plate and implies a significant coupling across the Nares Strait. The paleostress field analysis is consistent with the assumption that the Eurekan strike-slip faults southeast of the Pearya Terrane are reactivated Ellesmerian structures. The left-lateral strike-slip fault activity was likely older than the right-lateral strike-slip fault activity. This supports the assumption that the Eurekan phase 1 deformation on Ellesmere Island is characterized by left-lateral strike-slip faults, whereas during Eurekan phase 2 the majority of right-lateral strike-slip faults formed. Ongoing seismic activity in the area of the Pearya Terrane and southeast of it implies that some of the faults in this region are still active.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nAll authors contributed to the manuscript and agree with the current version.\n\n","37":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nThe interelations between magma emplacement and crustal deformation are governed by complex processes because of the overall large viscosity difference between upper crustal rocks and magmas. Two types of behavior are described: \u201cactive emplacement\u201d when the magma production rate is larger than opening of voids by tectonic processes, whereas \u201cpassive\u201d emplacement represents the opposite situation (Hutton, 1988). In this context, the fertility of magma sources would be the main driving parameter, especially when considering that the rate of magma ascent is often much higher than most tectonic processes (Paterson and Tobisch, 1992). de Saint Blanquat et al. (2011), based on a review of a large number of natural situations reached a similar conclusion whatever the scale of the pluton, pluton emplacement in the upper crust is much shorter in duration (several hundred thousand years or a few million years for the largest plutons) and occurs at much faster rates than tectonic deformation. This can explain why some plutons emplaced during the course of an active tectonic deformation can share many characteristics of post-kinematic intrusions (de Saint-Blanquat et al., 2001).\nThe situation may however prove different in the case of plutons forming and then emplacing within metamorphic core complexes (MCCs). Syn-kinematic plutons have been described in different contexts, along strike-slip shear zones such as the South Armorican Shear Zone (Berth\u00e9 et al., 1979; Augier et al., 2015a), or along extensional shear zones with the examples of the Basin and Range (Holm, 1995), Southeast China (Charles et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013; Ji et al., 2018), the Variscan belt (Gapais et al., 1993; Augier et al., 2015a, 2015b), the Aegean MCCs (Faure et al., 1991; Lee and Lister, 1992; Rabillard et al., 2017) or the Paleozoic post-orogenic extension context of Calabria (Caggianelli et al., 2000). Extension is a context where space is created continuously and the plutons and their host rocks are largely exhumed so that the interactions between the activity of extensional shear zones and the coeval intrusions can be observed and described (Hutton et al., 1990; Rabillard et al., 2017). Post-orogenic extension after a phase of crustal thickening, and more specifically when it occurs in a back-arc environment where the hot asthenosphere is advected upward below the thick crust, is a favorable context to produce granitoids interacting with detachments. The Aegean Sea or the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea provide several examples of plutons emplaced in the core of MCCs below low-angle detachments during the Miocene (Faure and Bonneau, 1988; Faure et al., 1991; Lee and Lister, 1992). Recent studies have shown a common scheme in all these plutons and their associated detachments (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Laurent et al., 2015; Rabillard et al., 2015; Ducoux et al., 2016; Bessi\u00e8re et al., 2017; Rabillard et al., 2017). The Aegean granitoid plutons were emplaced during a rather short period between 16 and 8 Ma coeval with the fast rotation of the Hellenides and formation of a first-order tear in the subducting slab (Fig. 1\n inset, de Boorder et al., 1998; Biryol et al., 2011; Jolivet et al., 2015). The plutons were exhumed below two main sets of detachments, the North Cycladic Detachment System (NCDS) and the West Cycladic Detachment System (WCDS) and several of them intruded the core of MCCs made of high grade migmatitic gneiss below the NCDS (Ikaria, Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia and Naxos-Paros) while other intruded higher in the crust (e.g. Tinos, Serifos or Lavrio).\nOligo-Miocene extension in the Cyclades (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n) follows an episode of continental subduction and crustal thickening in HP-LT conditions recorded in the Cycladic Blueschists Unit (CBU) during the Eocene (Altherr et al., 1982; Wijbrans and McDougall, 1988; Shaked et al., 2000; Trotet et al., 2001a; 2001b; Jolivet et al., 2004a, 2004b; Ring et al., 2007; Brun and Faccenna, 2008; Jolivet and Brun, 2010; Ring et al., 2010, 2011; Laurent et al., 2016, 2017). The heterogeneity of the crust acquired during this early stage played an important role in localizing the main extensional structures, especially the NCDS (Le Pourhiet et al., 2004; Huet et al., 2011; Augier et al., 2015a, 2015b; Labrousse et al., 2016). Compared to the underlying CBU, the Upper Cycladic Unit (UCU), shows a contrasted lithologies. It is either made of an ophiolitic nappe with its basal metamorphic sole, like on Tinos Island (Katzir et al., 1996; Lamont et al., 2020) or orthogneiss or other continental basement units like on Syros (Maluski et al., 1987; Keiter et al., 2004; Soukis and St\u00f6ckli, 2013) or Anafi Islands (Reinecke et al., 1982; Martha et al., 2016). Both the inverted mechanical stratigraphy due to the overthrusting of an ophiolite nappe on top of the weaker CBU and the presence of other nappe contacts were shown to favor strain localization and formation of MCCs (Labrousse et al., 2016). The intrusion of granitoids during the Miocene within these MCC induced a migration of the detachments upward and in the direction of shearing (Rabillard et al., 2017). The NCDS and the WCDS are thus made of a succession in time and space of up to three detachments (Jolivet et al., 2010; Rabillard et al., 2017). The lower detachments are mostly active in the ductile regime and they are locally inactivated when the granitic pluton intrudes them, while the uppermost one is only brittle and controls the deposition of a supra-detachment basin (Menant et al., 2013; Rabillard et al., 2017).\nThe Aegean granitoids were emplaced within a short period between \u223c16 and 8 Ma V-(Skarpelis et al., 1992; Altherr and Siebel, 2002; Brichau et al., 2007, 2008; Liati et al., 2009; Bolhar et al., 2010). They show distinct geochemical features indicating either a mantle or crustal origin, which has been debated (Altherr and Siebel, 2002; Pe-Piper et al., 2002; Pe-Piper and Piper, 2006; Stouraiti et al., 2010; Bolhar et al., 2012). The older plutons, such as the Karkinagrion and Xylosyrtis leucogranitic plutons of Ikaria display a dominating crustal contribution and they are associated with migmatite domes, while the younger ones, such as the Tinos granodiorite have a larger mantle component. However, all plutons show a significant component of crustal melting. Granitoid bodies intrude the migmatitic core of the MCCs and then interact with the detachments (Bessi\u00e8re et al., 2017) during a period bracketed between 18 and 11 Ma (Ring et al., 2018). In the case of Naxos, the intrusion of the granodiorite occurred when the external part of the dome had already cooled down as shown by the occurrence of a contact metamorphism envelope in the dome at the sharp contact with the pluton (Buick and Holland, 1989; Urai et al., 1990), while on Ikaria (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Laurent et al., 2015) and Mykonos the dome was still hot and viscous as shown below. On Mykonos, most recent tectonic studies concentrated on the granitoids and their deformation below the NCDS (Faure and Bonneau, 1988; Lee and Lister, 1992; Brichau et al., 2008; Lecomte et al., 2010; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011; Menant et al., 2013). Very few studies (Lucas, 1999; Pe-Piper et al., 2002; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011) were so far dedicated to field observations in the migmatitic core on Mykonos and its extension in Delos and Rheneia because these latter islands are not normally accessible to geological survey as they are within a perimeter reserved for archeological studies. Yet, only a small part of the migmatitic core of the MCC crops out on Mykonos where field work has been concentrated up to now. The opportunity to make a new geological map including new data from these two islands was thus an important opening.\nThis paper presents the results of our investigations in the field on Delos and Rheneia and their integration in the framework of the Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia (MDR) MCC, focusing on the geometry and deformation within the migmatitic core of the MCC and interactions with the main pluton. The MDR MCC completes the observations made on Ikaria where the migmatitic dome crops out only in a limited perimeter and on Naxos where the deep interactions with the hot dome are not displayed. This example shows the detailed interactions at depth between the migmatitic dome and the rising pluton, observations that cannot be easily made in the other Aegean plutons. Based on these new field observations, we propose a conceptual model of the emplacement of a pluton within a viscous migmatitic dome actively deforming and its evolution during cooling and interaction with the detachments.\n\n\n2\nGeological setting\nThe Cyclades archipelago forms a wide submarine plateau in the center of the Aegean Sea (Fig. 1) where a series of islands shows the apex of several MCC formed during the Oligocene and Miocene (Fig. 2). Extension is a consequence of slab retreat and coeval collapse of the Hellenides-Taurides mountain belt formed earlier during the Eocene by subduction and collision of a small partly oceanic basin, the Pindos Basin, and its southern margin belonging to Apulia with the southern margin of Eurasia (Le Pichon and Angelier, 1979, 1981b, a; Jolivet and Brun, 2010), to the southwest of the Vardar Ocean suture zone (Dercourt et al., 1986; Ricou et al., 1998; Schmid et al., 2008; Tremblay et al., 2015; Menant et al., 2016). The Cycladic Blueschists (Blake et al., 1984), mostly formed during this Eocene episode, were exhumed progressively. First exhumation took place during the syn-orogenic stage with an excellent preservation of blueschists-facies and eclogite-facies parageneses on Syros (Br\u00f6cker and Enders, 1999; Keiter et al., 2004; Schumacher et al., 2008; Philippon et al., 2011; Laurent et al., 2016) and Sifnos (Avigad et al., 1992; Lister and Raouzaios, 1996; Groppo et al., 2009; Aravadinou et al., 2015; Roche et al., 2016). Then, exhumation was completed during the Late Oligocene and Miocene during the post-orogenic stage in the back-arc region of the retreating Hellenic subduction (Jolivet et al., 1994a, b; Trotet et al., 2001a; Vanderhaeghe, 2009; Jolivet and Brun, 2010; Grasemann et al., 2012). In the latter case, the HP-LT parageneses were more or less intensely overprinted in HT-LP conditions, locally reaching those of partial melting as in Naxos (Jansen, 1977; Buick and Holland, 1989; Urai et al., 1990; Keay et al., 2001; Vanderhaeghe, 2004; Duch\u00eane et al., 2006), Paros Papanikolaou, 1979; Bargnesi et al., 2013), Ikaria (Beaudoin et al., 2015) and Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia (Faure and Bonneau, 1988; Lucas, 1999; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011). Intermediate conditions and two-staged exhumation P\u2013T paths are displayed in MCC that evolved progressively between the syn-orogenic and the post-orogenic stages (Tinos, Andros) (Jolivet and Brun, 2010). The late exhumation of these domes, partly coeval with emplacement of intrusions, has been dated with thermochronology, showing the progressive exhumation below the low-angle detachments (Brichau et al., 2006, 2007; 2008; Soukis and St\u00f6ckli, 2013).\nOligo-Miocene extension was distributed across the archipelago between two main detachments. The NCDS (Jolivet et al., 2010) dips mostly toward the north or the northeast. It can be followed from Evia, Andros, Tinos, Mykonos, Ikaria to Samos and extends within the Simav Detachments bounding the Menderes MCC to the north (Jolivet et al., 2013). The kinematics along the NCDS is top-to-the N\/NE as observed on Mykonos. Top-to-the north kinematics is also observed on the Naxos-Paros Detachment (Urai et al., 1990; Buick, 1991; Gautier et al., 1993; Gautier and Brun, 1994b, a; Jolivet et al., 1994a, 1994b; Gautier et al., 1999; Bargnesi et al., 2013; Bessi\u00e8re et al., 2017) and in more southern islands such as Ios (Huet et al., 2009) and Sikinos (Augier et al., 2015a, 2015b; Poulaki et al., 2019). The WCDS (Grasemann and Petrakakis, 2007; Iglseder et al., 2011; Grasemann et al., 2012) and its extension within the South Aegean Detachment (Grasemann et al., 2017; Grasemann et al., 2017; Schneider et al., 2018) dips toward the south or southwest with an opposite top-to-the-S\/SW kinematics. Ring et al. (2011) reported the presence of a low-angle detachment with top-SW kinematic indicators on Sifnos, which they attributed to the South Cyclades Detachment. Roche et al. (2016) then showed that the same low-angle fault is in fact associated with top-NE kinematic that developed under greenschists-facies conditions. On Sifnos, only some late SW-dipping normal faults could be associated with the South Cycladic Detachment. Similar observations can be made on Folegandros (Augier et al., 2015a, 2015b). On Ios, top-S kinematic indicators in the southern half of the island have been diversely interpreted. Lister et al. (1984) used these to document the kinematics of the detachment observed further north of Naxos, which proved later to be associated with a top-N kinematics. Vandenberg and Lister (1996) described these kinematic indicators in more details. Huet et al. (2009) after a detailed mapping of kinematic indicators over the whole island have interpreted top-south criteria as either related to the pre-extension HP-LT thrust-related deformation for those associated with blueschists facies mineral phases or to conjugate to the top-N ones for the later ones for the later ones that developed under greenschist-facies conditionse, giving a component of co-axial strain during the Neogene extension. The northern part of the island instead shows only top-N kinematic indicators along discrete shear zones related to the Paros-Naxos detachment system. More recently, Mizera and Behrmann (2015) interpreted these same top-S kinematic indicators as related to a distinct top-south shear zone. This issue is still debated. Nonetheless, the South Cycladic Detachment and its extension in the West Cycladic Detachment, as described in Grasemann et al. (2012) and Schneider et al. (2018) extends from Lavrion, Kea, Kythnos all the way to Serifos and Santorini. The South Cycladic Detachment (SCD) has indeed been described on Santorini with a top-to-the south kinematics (Schneider et al., 2018).\nTwo types of MCC are recognized. \u00ab Cold \u00bb b-type MCC preserve rather well the HP-LT parageneses and they are elongated perpendicular to the main direction of stretching (e.g. Andros, Tinos) while \u201chot\u201d a-type MCC, cored with HT-gneiss and migmatites, are elongated parallel to the main stretching direction (e.g. Ikaria, Naxos, Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia) (Jolivet et al., 2004a, 2004b). The hot MCCs and associated intrusions developed above a first-order tear in the Hellenic slab formed between 15 and 8 Ma (Jolivet et al., 2015), coeval with the fast clockwise rotation of the Hellenides (van Hinsbergen et al., 2005).\nThe core of Cycladic HT-domes of Ikaria, Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia and Naxos-Paros is characterized by micaschists and gneiss, partly migmatitic (Andriessen et al., 1987; Urai et al., 1990; Faure et al., 1991; Gautier et al., 1993; Keay et al., 2001; Duch\u00eane et al., 2006; Beaudoin et al., 2015; Lamont et al., 2018; Vanderhaeghe et al., 2018) and are sometimes correlated with the continental basement of the Cycladic Blueschists (Jolivet et al., 2004a, 2004b; Roche et al., 2019). This basement can also be observed in the lower units of Ios and Sykinos islands where no evidence of HT-LP metamorphism is observed (Vandenberg and Lister, 1996; Augier et al., 2015a, 2015b). If a clear difference can be made on Naxos between the basement (migmatitic core) and the overlying marble cover or probably early Mesozoic depositional age, it is not so clear on Mykonos or Delos and Rheneia because most lithologies are pelitic. The presence of thick marble layers in this region is indicative of a Mesozoic depositional age but when these marbles are absent, the attribution is difficult. On Ios and Sikinos, the basement unit do not show any HT-LP metamorphism and a clear difference can be made with the overlying Cycladic Blueschists. We thus consider that the true basement can be found in the migmatitic core of Naxos and the lower units of Ios and Sikinos. Other HT units can originally belong either to the basement or to some more recent mostly pelitic stratigraphic sequence. The age of the migmatitization is not always known with precision but recent studies in Naxos (Ring et al., 2018) and Ikaria (Beaudoin et al., 2015) show that the main episode of partial melting is early to middle Miocene in age (between 16 and 13 Ma). In this study we consider that the migmatites observed on Delos and Rheneia all date back to the same period of the Miocene as structural correlations with granitic dikes and pluton show that migmatites and granites recorded the same deformation history, that occurred during the period of granitic intrusions (see below).\nThe Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia MCC (Fig. 3\n) was one of the first described in the Aegean region (Faure and Bonneau, 1988; Faure et al., 1991; Lee and Lister, 1992). The emplacement of the Mykonos granitoids below an extensional detachment was recognized and the first-order geometry of the migmatitic dome described. Later studies showed that the core of the dome and the roots of the intrusions are located on Delos and Rheneia with rather steep magmatic and tectonic foliations contrasting with the low-angle mylonites developed below the detachment (Lucas, 1999; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011). The co-magmatic deformation within the Delos pluton and the distribution of different magmatic facies all indicate a main, locally strong E\u2013W elongation (Lucas, 1999; Pe-Piper et al., 2002; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011). The Mykonos-Delos intrusion is a laccolith dipping shallowly toward the east on Mykonos and rooting on Delos and Rheneia in a zone of steeper foliation (Den\u00e8le et al., 2011). On Mykonos, most of the intrusion is affected by two low-angle branches of the NCDS, mapped in detail by Menant et al. (2013). The extensional activity of the detachments and the exhumation of the intrusion are documented by radiochronology and low-T thermochronology (Brichau et al., 2008) and by the detailed interactions between the pluton, the different branches of the detachments and the late mineralization (Menant et al., 2013). The lower Livada Detachment is a ductile shear zone affecting the intrusive contact of the pluton within the UCU essentially made of greenschists-facies metabasites (Jolivet et al., 2010; Lecomte et al., 2010). It is associated with a thick shear zone deforming most of the intrusion on the island. A large-scale gradient is observed from co-magmatic and late-magmatic deformation in the west toward mylonites and ultra-mylonites in the east in the vicinity of the detachment. The E\u2013W to ENE\u2013WSW direction of stretching and the toP\u2013To-the east sense of shear are consistent over the whole island. Conversely, the upper Mykonos Detachment is a purely brittle low-angle fault carrying a late Miocene supra-detachment basin filled with coarse clastic sediments including conglomerates, sandstones and minor shales with clear evidence of syn-extension deposition (Avigad et al., 1998; Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2002; Menant et al., 2013). Observations of the detachment plane and syn-sedimentary normal faults show a NE- to NNE-trending direction of extension similar to that observed on Tinos and Andros (Lecomte et al., 2010). A series of late NNW-SSE trending dykes filled with barite and iron hydroxides cut the mylonites, the cataclasites and the two detachments within the same extensional regime (Lecomte et al., 2010; Menant et al., 2013; Tombros et al., 2015). It was shown that these dykes formed during the cooling of the granite once it had entered the brittle field during the latest exhumation steps and that they were fed by fluids convecting between the hot basement and the colder basin brines above (Menant et al., 2013).\nThe Mykonos laccolith formed through successive magma batches intruding at short intervals and shows different magmatic facies from a pyroxene monzo-granite in the SE to a biotite-monzogranite in the NW, the latter predominating on the island (Lucas, 1999; Lecomte et al., 2010; Den\u00e8le et al., 2011). The Delos and Rheneia plutonic facies were studied in detail by Lucas (1999). Mafic enclaves in the core zone testify for a contribution of mantle partial melting during extension and crustal thinning. Most of the intrusion is made of a granodiorite originating from lower crustal partial melting but a component of mantle source is present as well (Pe-Piper et al., 2002). On the Apollonia peninsula, Delos and Rheneia, a planar-linear fabric in the pluton can either result from the orientation of crystals within the flowing magma or by piezocristallization during cooling. In both cases this planar-linear fabrics was formed early during the evolution of the pluton (Lucas, 1999). A later study by Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) shows that the base of the Mykonos laccolith on the Apollonia peninsula at the contact with the migmatitic dome is diffuse and generally parallel to the ductile fabric and the layering of the migmatites (Fig. 4\nA). Alternating garnet-sillimanite gneiss, migmatites and granite with large alkali-feldspar phenocrysts mark the contact (Fig. S1), contrasting with the sharp contact associated with contact metamorphism observed in the southern part of the intrusion on Naxos. There, enclaves of paragneiss and marbles of various sizes belonging to the HT dome are included in the granite. Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) distinguish four petrographic types within the intrusion: a syenogranite in the northeast near Cape Evros intruding the UCU metabasites and then sheared along the Livada Detachment, a discontinuous biotite monzogranite (or locally a leucogranite) along the basal contact of the laccolith near Apollonia, a biotite hornblende porphyric monzogranite covering most of the island and a pyroxene porphyric granodiorite with mafic enclaves. Lucas (1999) interpret this zonation and the petrography of the pluton as an inverse zonation, consequence of the drainage of a infra-crustal magma chamber from top to bottom. The intimate link with the migmatite however shows that the plutonic and migmatitic materials were still in the partial-melting field while the granitic magma emplaced. This is in line with the observations of Altherr and Siebel (2002); Altherr et al. (1988) and Stouraiti et al. (2010) that the generation of the Cyclades plutons involves a large component of crustal partial melting. The main source would resemble the biotite paragneiss of Rheneia (Stouraiti et al., 2010).\nFew geological maps are so far available for Delos and Rheneia. The first mapping survey was done from 1906 to 1908 and the first map published by Lucien Cayeux (Cayeux, 1911) in the framework of the starting archeological exploration of the Delos sanctuary. It shows mainly granitic rocks with some marble enclaves, amphibolites and gneiss enclaves, covering most of Delos Island and the eastern part of Rheneia, and a large body of \u201cgneiss micac\u00e9s\u201d. A similar map of the two islands was included in the Mykonos Island-Rinia Islands sheet published by IGME (Avdis, 2004). Pe-Piper et al. (2002) insist on the importance of E\u2013W striking shear zones associated with a steep foliation and horizontal lineation in the center of Delos, which they relate to a component of dextral shear. Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) used the map of Delos and eastern Rheneia proposed by Isabelle Lucas in her PhD (Lucas, 1999) showing the distribution of plutonic facies. The only detailed work on the structure and kinematics of deformation is the work of Den\u00e8le et al. (2011). These authors show a pervasive E\u2013W trending stretching lineation carried by a low-angle foliation forming open domes in the NW part of Rheneia and a steep E\u2013W-striking foliation in the southeastern part of Rheneia facing Delos where the foliation in the granite is steep and E\u2013W. Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) interpret Delos and Rheneia as the root zone of the Mykonos laccolith and put forward three successive episodes of deformation, forceful intrusion in the root zone leading to a prolate fabric, protomylonitization immediately following cooling and finally mylonitization below the detachment.\n\n\n3\nA new geological map of Delos and Rheneia\nIn this part, we present the results of our field survey on Delos and Rheneia with a new geological map (Figs. 5\n). Our study is the first one integrating both Rheneia and Delos on single map with a complete survey. Beside a new description of rock facies (Figs. 4 & 6\n and supplementary material), our survey leads to the discovery of a new large-scale shear zone named here the Rheneia Shear Zone encompassing a large part of the central island between Ataliotis Bay, the Lazaret and Cape Glaros. The following rock facies are encountered on the map.\n\n3.1\nMetamorphic rocks\nMigmatitic gneiss, either diatexites or metatexites, and non-migmatitic gneiss (leucocratic or melanocratic) can be described on Delos and Rheneia.\nMigmatitic gneiss (Figs. 4, S2\u2212S4) crop out in the northern part of Delos in contact with the granitic rocks and in the eastern part of Rheneia in the core of the dome. Migmatites are also observed as septas of various size inside the main intrusion (Figs. 4E, S5, S6). Some of these enclaves are of mappable size reaching up to 200 m in length (Figs. 5,10). We use here the terminology for migmatites proposed by Maxeiner et al. (2017), modified from Sawyer (2008) and Sawyer and Brown (2008), see also Vanderhaeghe (2001). Both metatexites with a low degree of melting and a preserved cohesion (Fig. S4) and diatexites with a nebulitic texture (Figs. 4, S2) are observed. Diatexites are present both in the core of the dome on Rheneia and within the granite on Delos as large enclaves. In-situ concordant (Fig. S3) and foliation-discordant leucosomes are often intensely sheared and transposed in the regional foliation (Fig. 4D). If not associated with an indication of partial melting gneiss are considered non-migmatitic.\nBiotite melanocratic gneiss with a typical grey patina crop out in the northern part of Delos and in the southern half of Rheneia (Figs. 4B -lower grey gneiss and lower biotite gneiss-, 10, 11, S7), overlying the migmatites. They show a strong layering alternating dark and leucocratic layers. They are often invaded by intrusive aplitic and pegmatitic sills and dykes, more or less transposed by shearing in the Rheneia Shear Zone described below. Variation in biotite modal proportion allows distinguishing grey mica-rich layers from quarto-feldspathic layers giving to the rock a typical banded facies. Quartz and feldspar form compact centimetric layers. Within felsic layers, quartz is abundant and shows undulose extinction and K-feldspars form elongated aggregates. Orthoclase are from place to place infiltrated by worm-like quartz myrmekite patches. Plagioclase is virtually absent. In more mafic layers biotite forms millimeter unstrained millimetric pristine crystals lying within the foliation without inclusion. Accessory mineral are apatite, titanite, zircon and tourmaline.\nGneiss is also observed as enclaves within the massive granite (Figs. 4E, 6 E, S3C, S5, S6, S15). Those brownish gneiss form either the bulk of small metric lenses or are associated with interbedded marble and amphibolite\/pyroxenite layers within larger few hundred meters long enclaves. These gneisses have a characteristic brown patina due to a higher proportion of biotite compared to banded migmatitic gneiss. Micaceous layers are thicker compared to felsic material forming lenticular sheet giving the appearance of an augen-gneiss defined by almond-shaped quartzo-feldspathic nodules. These rocks with more than 50% biotite with a compositional layering are interpreted as aluminous paragneisses.\nMuscovite leucocratic gneiss covering most of the northern half of Rheneia (Figs. 5 -upper muscovite gneiss-, S9). These gneiss are described as migmatitic in Den\u00e8le et al. (2011). They are made of an alternation of beige fine-grained gneiss with white micas and whitish layers with a more feldspar-rich composition. Our new observations suggest instead that these white layers are not leucosomes but correspond to the complete transposition of acidic dykes rich in quartz and feldspar intruded within pelitic micaschists during the formation of the Rheneia Shear Zone (Fig. S9). The interface of the two gneiss types is observed on Rheneia along the narrow isthmus separating the northern and southern halves of the island (Figs. 6C, S8). Within the contact zone an intense layering results from shearing in the core of the Rheneia Shear Zone.\nAmphibolites are observed in enclaves highly variable in size, from a few centimeters to several tens of meters, within the granitic rocks. The largest one are found on Delos on Ghlastropi hill (Fig. 5) overlooking the antique theater and in the southern part of the Delos pluton. At Ghlastropi and on a cape southeast of Mount Kynthos, they are associated with coarse-grained marbles (Fig. S10). Marbles crop out as large enclaves within the pluton, either with amphibolites or alone. Their grain-size is variable but usually coarse, reaching several cm southeast of Mount Kynthos. The latter outcrop shows a close association of the coarsest-grained marble with a large chunk of amphibolite. The contact of the marble with the amphibolite is marked with skarn layers, a few tens of cm thick, with garnets and pyroxene. The skarn garnet is made of xenomorphic andradite (Adr90-80Grs10-20) and the pyroxene layer of hedenbergite (Hd20-40Dio80-60), with scattered massive crystals of vesuvianite (Cayeux, 1911). Amphibolite and marbles show a common strong foliation and a stretching lineation, and late veins formed in the conditions of the greenschist-facies cut the amphibolite, indicating the same direction of stretching, parallel to the regional extension. The long axis of the lenses is generally NESW, which is the main stretching direction in the island and the dip of bedding is variable.\nField relations show that the non-migmatitic gneiss are not the deformed equivalent of the migmatites and that, instead, they correspond to the partially molten core of a dome otherwise not molten. The migmatite, either metatexites or diatexites show the classical duality between leucosomes and restites, and the cohesion of the foliation is lost in the diatexites. Surrounding gneiss, instead, do not show any trace of partial melting and they are intruded by granitic dykes and sills not produced locally. High shearing strain of these gneiss and intrusive dykes leads to banded gneiss with acidic lithologies that do not correspond to former leucosomes.\n\n\n3.2\nPlutonic rocks\nThe categories of granitoids indentified on the map are based on the detail study of Lucas (1999). Two predominant facies are observed (Figs. 6, S11). A first facies is composed of a monzogranite containing biotite, hornblende and pyroxene, it often includes mafic enclaves. They outcrop in the central part of the pluton in Delos and Rheneia and marginally in Mykonos and form as a whole around 15% of the granitoid outcrops. Pe-Piper et al. (2002) describe the same rock as granodiorite. The second facies is also a monzogranite with biotite and hornblende but without pyroxene. It constitutes the main body (80%) of Mykonos-Delos_Rheneia pluton. Numerous aplitic and subsidiary pegmatitic dykes intrude the biotite gneiss in the vicinity of the contact with the granite (Figs. 7, 8\n\n, S13). Several generations are observed, more or less affected by the deformation showing their syn-kinematic character. The earlier dykes are folded and transposed parallel to the regional foliation while others with similar composition intrude these folded ones and are less deformed. Fig. 7D shows an acidic dyke cutting the foliation of the host gneiss and itself stretched along the same direction. Figs. 8A shows highly sheared dyke totally transposed parallel to the regional foliation and then folded. Fig. 8B shows three generations of acidic dykes. The oldest are strongly sheared and transposed. The resulting gneiss is then cut by a new dyke, which is itself stretched (here the YZ plane is shown so that the stretching is not visible). A third pegmatitic dyke, less deformed cut through the two earlier generations. These observations show that the various generations of dykes are emplaced during the deformation process. Dykes are also observed within the intrusion. Fig. S13B shows a dyke oriented E\u2013W with fuzzy boundaries and evidence for fluidality of the granitic magma in the southern part of the intrusion on Delos where mafic enclaves are observed in large numbers and the granite poorly oriented. It shows that deformation was active while the pluton was partly consolidated and injections continued.\nThe massive I-type granitic pluton that crops out over a large part of Delos, from the center to the south has a phaneritic texture. The density of mafic enclaves increases southward. The main body of the pluton consists essentially of amphibole-biotite-bearing granite with large K-feldspar megacrysts. It is the dominant facies in Mykonos (Fig. 6). The tabular K-feldspar crystals vary in size (from few millimeters up to few centimeter) and modal proportion within a coarse to medium grained groundmass of plagioclase, quartz and mafic mineral such as amphibole coexisting with variable amount of biotite. In Delos, amphibole granite without biotite is observed south of Ghourna bay and Kato-Skardania towards the northern contact with migmatitic gneiss. They are leucocratic with a pink patina and are titanite-rich. Such a facies is also found in Mykonos to the west of Appolonia peninsula and sporadically in Rheneia in the eastern peninsula at the contact with the gneiss. Finally biotite granite without amphibole in Delos is observed as a discontinuous layer, tens meter thick, at the contact with the northern migmatitic gneiss conformable with gneissic structure. Note that this ordinary granite without amphibole forms also late intrusion found essentially within the dyke complex intruding migmatitic gneiss in the northern part of the island. It is found as well as a particular facies within the amphibole porphyry granitic pluton such as in the southeast contact of the marble-amphibolite enclave southeast of Mont Kynthos. Orthoclase varies between 25 and 30%, plagioclase 18\u201326% and biotite 20\u201322%. Accessory phases are magnetite, ilmenite and titanite. Whatever the respective abundance of amphibole and biotite, quartz never exceeds 30% and K-feldspar (orthoclase) dominates over or equals plagioclase modal proportion. According to the IUGS nomenclature (Streckeisen, 1975) the rocks can be classified as low-silica high-K granite with some variations close to the field of granodiorites. Accessory minerals are zircon, titanite, apatite, red-brown pleochro\u00efc allanite, magnetite, and ilmenite. Titanite with its typical high relief diamond-shaped cross-sections may be abundant especially in amphibole granite without biotite. Zircon is widespread and included both in felsic and mafic minerals. K-feldspar (Or81-93Ab17-06An02-01) may include euhedral plagioclase (An43-19Ab55-79Or2-1) and mafic minerals. Amphibole is a green\/brown hornblende scattered throughout the section or forming aggregates. Biotite is an Al-poor biotite (XMg 46\u221239, 3.2\u20134.3% TiO2).\nIn more detail, close to the contact with the northern migmatitic gneiss to the east, the granite shows locally abrupt textural variation from isotropic texture to foliated gneissic texture. Such a gradual contact is particularly striking along a fault located between Gamilla Hill in the west and Patiniotis peninsula in the east (Fig. 5). From south to north, the porphyritic amphibole-biotite granite passes to migmatitic gneiss over approximately 20 m. First, the proportion of orthoclase megacrysts increases drastically, forming more than 50% of the rocks volume with alignment of elongated crystal along their c-axis in a plane parallel to the gneiss foliation. Then, the granite forms residual lenses and disrupted sills within massive feldspar-rich or micaceous gneiss. White aplite veins within the northern gneiss show a saccharoid texture dominated by deformed K-feldspar and quartz. Pegmatitic veins are dominated by quartz. These veins, less than 1 m wide, are observed in the extreme north of the northern gneiss. They contain centimeter-size crystals including either muscovite or tourmaline.\nPyroxene monzogranite or granodiorite outcrop in the central part of Delos pluton. They have a porphyritic texture but are distinguished from the monzogranite described above by significantly lower proportion in K-feldspar megacrysts. They also stand out for their mafic magmatic enclaves showing variable size (metric to decametric), shape and composition (gabbro, diorite, monzodiorite). Note that those mafic enclaves, witnessing the presence at depth of a mafic magma, are largely present almost everywhere but are more numerous in the southern part of the Delos granite, in a region where the pluton is less oriented. These pyroxene-bearing granito\u00efdes are leucocratic (with up to 70% quartz-plagioclase-K-feldspar where plagioclase + feldspar dominates over quartz) and contain biotite, amphibole and pyroxene. Accessory minerals are allanite, apatite and titanite. Quartz proportion varies between 16 and 27%. Feldspars with orthose composition range from 6.4\u201318% while plagioclases (labrador to oligoclase) vary between 28\u201345.6%. Biotites, up to 16% in modal proportion, dominate over amphibole and shows variable Al\/Mg contents especially in granodioritic facies while in monzonitic one it has lower and rather constant alumina content. Amphiboles vary between 1.7 and 8% in modal proportion. They are ferro-pargasite in the monzonitic facies and ferro-edenite in the granodioritic one. Pyroxene shows variable proportions (from 0.5 \u00e0 12.5%) somewhat complementary with amphibole one and has a ferro-diopside composition whatever the facies.\nLeucogranite is observed exclusively in the south of the island southwest from Kato-Vardia and are associated with pyroxene monzonite\/grandiorite described above. The medium to fine-grained rock contains up to 45% quartz, up to 35% K-feldspar and less than 10% plagioclase and biotite. Pegmatitic layers are exclusively formed by coarse quartz and K-feldspar and include tourmaline in spherical aggregates.\nOrdinary granite (feldspar, quartz and biotite) without amphibole is fine to coarse-grained and show an aphaneritic texture. It may be sometime porphyritic when orthoclase crystals are more than 1 cm long. These are late granites found essentially within the dyke complex intruding migmatitic gneiss in the northern part of the island. It is also found as a particular facies within the amphibole porphyry granitic pluton such as in the southeast contact of the marble-amphibolite enclave southeast of Mont Kynthos. Orthoclase varies between 25 and 30%, plagioclase 18\u201326% and biotite 20\u201322%. Accessory phases are magnetite, ilmenite and titanite.\nThe distribution of metamorphic enclaves within the pluton is irregular. The largest enclaves (several hundred of meters long) made of gneiss, migmatites, amphibolites or marbles are found in the center of Delos and around the sanctuary (Fig. 5). It is not clear whether these large enclaves in fact correspond to screens and shear zones between different intrusions as proposed by Pe-Piper et al. (2002) because the transitions between the different facies of the granite are often gradual. We rather interpret them as septas of the surrounding gneiss and of the CBU enclosed in the magma as it rose toward the surface and was deformed (Fig. S14) but more detailed studies would help answering this question. They show the same stretching direction as the granite and the gneiss around it. Their deformation was likely acquired before they were enclaved in the granite and continued afterward with the same general E\u2013W stretching as shown by the example of the metabasites associated with the marble SE of Mount Kynthos. Mafic enclaves witnessing the presence at depth of a mafic magma are largely present almost everywhere but more numerous in the southern part of the Delos granite, in a region where the pluton is less oriented.\n\n\n3.3\nSedimentary rocks\nOutcrops of sedimentary rocks are very limited on Delos, Rheneia and Mykonos and primarily correspond to recent deposits. Beach rocks have been recognized along the western cost of Delos (Desruelles and Fouache, 2007) and correlated with the ones of Rheneia and Mykonos (Desruelles et al., 2009), they correspond to different level stands of the middle Holocene and show a relative subsidence of 4 m of the western central cost of Delos during the last 5000 years. Onshore, the deposits of the three islands are more variable.\nIn Delos, only two clear outcrops exist, one (P1) between the sanctuary and the gymnasium (Fig. S15 A) and one eastward of Fourni bay. The initial extension of P1 may have been larger before exploitation and extended to the western coast, alluvial deposits seems to extend southwestward toward the Arch\u00e9g\u00e8sion zone which is covered by about 1 m of thick calcareous sandstone. The earthwork done while building the temples caused the outcrops to disappear however remnants of these deposits are visible on the underlying granite in some buildings. The island morphology is compatible with a depot center in the valley that flows westward but, today, the continuity cannot be established between P1 outcrops and the cost. The matrix is calcareous and detrital clasts consist mainly in quartz and granite pebbles, poorly sorted and angular.\nIn Rheneia, in addition to the beachrocks, larger outcrops of recent sediments can be observed within the bed and mouths of small creeks. They can extend up to a few hundred meters from the coast but are restricted to the creek valleys. Facies are highly variable, from slope breccia and coarse calcareous conglomeratic sandstones to fine grained levels with cross-bedding (Fig. S15 B, S15 C) suggesting an alternation of fluviatile and nearshore influences. Thin-section observations confirm the marine setting of the fine grain levels where algae and foraminifera are numerous, detrital clasts have very local origin (granite, quartz, plagioclases). The presence of this kind of facies is rather common in the Mediterranean since the drastic sea level drop during the Messinian resulted in deep fluvial valleys later filled by fluviatile and\/or marine sediments during the Quaternary. It is worth keeping in mind that the three islands, Mykonos, Delos and Rheneia were connected and parts of a much larger island including Andros and Tinos during the last glacial maximum 21 ka ago (Simaiakis et al., 2017). The rather fast sea level changes during the Quaternary glaciations favored such intercalations fluviatile\/paleosol and shallow marine.\n\n\n\n4\nA cross-section through Rheneia and Delos\n\nFig. 9\n\n shows an E\u2013W cross-section through the southern part of Rheneia and the central part of Delos and two N\u2013S cross-sections through Delos and Rheneia (see location of Fig. 5). It highlights the geometrical relations between the different lithologies described above. The core of the gneissic structure is occupied by the migmatites as illustrated on cross-sections BB\u2019 and CC\u2019. However, because of the folds with E\u2013W axial planes, the contact between the migmatites and the granites can locally be vertical or even overturned, with the migmatites on top of the gneiss, as shown in the northern part of Delos (section AA\u2019).\nThe migmatites crop out on Rheneia thanks to antiforms with E\u2013W axes and steep axial planes (Figs. 5,9, S2). These migmatites also flank the Delos monzogranite along its northern boundary between Skardhana and Ghourna Bays (Figs. 5,9A, 13, S4) and they appear as large enclaves within Delos granite (Figs. 5,9A, S5). The migmatites are overlain in the core of the dome by the biotite-rich gneiss that crop out in the southern part of Rheneia and the northernmost part of Delos. The contact between these two lithologies is often fuzzy with a progressive transition and some recurrences of one facies within the other (Fig. S8). On top of the biotite-rich gneiss, the muscovite gneiss makes most of the northern half of Rheneia and part of Cape Morou peninsula on Delos. The contact between the two gneissic lithologies is made of regularly alternating dark and leucocratic gneiss in a zone where all early contacts, including dykes and sills are totally transposed in the regional foliation by the activity of the Rheneia Shear Zone (see description below) (Fig. S8).\nThe granites intrude the gneissic dome as sills, in the migmatitic gneiss and the biotite-rich gneiss, which are also observed as large enclaves and the intrusive contact is folded by the folds with E\u2013W axial planes. The northern parts of Delos and of the southeastern peninsula of Rheneia are invaded by acidic dykes around the limits of the pluton. These aplitic and pegmatitic dykes are intensely deformed within the Rheneia Shear Zone (Figs. 12,13) that was active during their emplacement. The foliation within the granitic intrusion is parallel to the foliation in the gneiss and the migmatites.\nThe overall geometry shows a series of antiforms and synforms with E\u2013W striking axes, almost horizontal on Delos and eastern Rheneia and slightly west-dipping in the central and western part of Rheneia, topped with the shallower-dipping gneiss of west Rheneia and northern Delos forming a gentle dome. Folds are open in the upper part of the dome and tighter in the deeper migmatitic gneiss. The axes of these tight folds seen in the migmatites plunge westward underneath the gneiss with a shallower west-dipping foliation of western Rheneia. The main foliation on the map thus appears with an E\u2013W strike in the core of the dome and with a N\u2013S strike in the western part.\n\n\n5\nProgressive deformation and syn-kinematic intrusions within the Rheneia Shear Zone\nThe entire region of Rheneia and Delos Islands is affected by intense deformation with evidences of strain gradient across major shear zones. Both the gneiss and the intrusions show a progressive deformation characterized by a single consistent E\u2013W stretching direction (Fig. 6F) as shown by the lineation map and stereograms of Fig. 10. This stretching lineation is carried by a foliation organized around folds with axes that trend parallel to the direction of the stretching lineation (Figs. 6B, S7). Poles of foliation are organized within a vertical plane striking \u223c160 \u00b0E perpendicular to the average trend of the lineation, in all three main facies, granitic rocks, gneiss and migmatites and with the same geometry on Delos and Rheneia (Fig. 10). This geometry is due to folding with axes parallel to the stretching direction. The foliation shows low dip in most of the northern half of Rheneia and it becomes steeper in the southeastern part of the island facing Delos (Fig. S2). On Delos the foliation is steep in the center of the island in the vicinity of the sanctuary (Fig. S4) and further south and it becomes shallower toward the north and the south. The steep foliation observed in the migmatites is due to folds with steep E\u2013W-striking axial planes observed along the eastern coast of Rheneia and in the southeastern peninsula (Fig. S2). The homogeneity of the granitic lithologies on Delos makes the observation of such folds difficult because of the absence of alternating compositions and because there is no original strong planar anisotropy in the non-deformed granites, but, when present, the foliation and the lineation have a similar attitude as in the gneiss. Smaller-scale folds are observed in the gneissic basement and in the marble lenses, in the migmatites as well as in the enclaves within the granite (Fig. S16). Most of these ductile synfolial folds show axes parallel to the stretching lineation but locally they display more N\u2013S axes (Fig. 6C).\nOne thus observes three types of folds: the first folds to form are synfolial folds seen at small scale in all lithologies with axial plane parallel to the main foliation. The orientation of their axes is not easy to measure but some of them are E\u2013W and other, less frequent are oblique, closer to N\u2013S. The regional foliation is then folded by open folds with E\u2013W axial planes in the upper part of the edifice. These folds are visible at map scale on Rheneia and Delos. They affect the gneiss, the migmatites and the foliated granites. In the core of the structure the foliation is folded by folds with steep limbs and E\u2013W-striking vertical axial planes. These folds are most of the time not recumbent but in the northern part of Delos, the migmatites of the core of the dome are seen above the biotite melanocratic gneiss. All these folds have their axes parallel to the stretching lineation and thus result from a high component of shearing that has transposed all structure parallel to the main shearing direction. All these folds, including the early synfolial ones, could have formed in a single continuum of shearing, but accurate dating would be necessary to be more conclusive on this matter. If we assume that, indeed, the folds belong to a single continuum of deformation, then the early synfolial folds should be seen on an -E\u2013W cross-section at large scale, as represented on Figs. 9C and 11\n\n\n. The configuration of the coastline is however not favorable for continuous observations along an E\u2013W section.\nThe stretching lineation is pervasive and its direction consistent over the whole studied region (Fig. 10). It is marked by the elongation of enclaves in the granite and the alignment of K-feldspar phenocrysts in the foliation (Figs. S3, S11, S12, S13, S14, S17). In the gneiss it is marked by the alignment of micas aggregates and the stretching of feldspar grains, the boudinage of aplitic dykes. A prolate fabric in the aplitic dykes also marks this well-organized stretching with a strong lineation visible in the XY foliation plane and the XZ plane, but no visible fabric in the YZ plane (Fig. S18).\nClear kinematic indicators in the XZ plane are not frequent. Those we could observe indicate a top-to-the east sense of shear shown by sigmoidal foliation and asymmetrically boudinaged dykes in the muscovite-gneiss of Rheneia (Fig. S17) or sheared dykes on Delos (Fig. S12D & S12E), but at least one local observation shows the opposite sense on Delos (Fig. S12 C).\nThe progressive deformation of the aplitic dykes shows intense folding and shearing in the gneiss above the granite and the migmatites as well as along the contact between the biotite-gneiss and the muscovite gneiss (Figs. 8,10,12,13). This thick shear zone is hereafter named the Rheneia Shear Zone. Figs. 7 and S12 shows several generations of dykes with variable grain-size progressively deformed within the shear zone in the course of their intruding the gneissic basement. The direction of stretching is the same in the host rock and in the dykes and the older dykes are progressively transposed by shearing and folding within the regional foliation. This suggests that the alternation of acidic and gneiss layers in the muscovite gneiss and in the contact zone is a consequence of the activity of the Rheneia Shear Zone. The shear zone can be followed all along the northern coast of the southeastern peninsula of Rheneia, from the isthmus, to Natalioti Bay and then to Cape Glaros (Figs. 5,12). It can be followed also northward along the east coast of Rheneia, at least to the latitude of the Lazaret (Fig. 5, Fig. 10) where the small peninsula attached to main island with a tombolo displays intensely deformed gneiss with spectacular synfolial folds. The Rheneia Shear Zone can then be observed on Delos in the gneiss injected by dykes from the coast of Skardhana Bay to Cape Morou and Patiniotis Peninsula (Fig. 13). The continuity of the shear zone across the narrow strait between Rheneia and Delos is not ascertained, but the position of the shear zones with respect to the granite observed on either side is similar and the distance is short compared to the magnitude of the shear zone. We thus consider that we have the same shear zone on the two islands. The intensity of folding and dyke transposition indicate a strong flattening associated with the evolution of the Rheneia Shear Zone. Whether or not this flattening was achieved within a regional non-coaxial flow is not known with precision but kinematic indicators we observed suggest a top-to-the east sense of shear (Fig. S17). The presence of synfolial folds with axes parallel to the stretching lineation would however suggest a strong component of simple shear within the shear zone (Fig. S7).\nMost of the basement enclaves show a foliation and stretching lineation parallel to the regional ones and to those observed within the intrusion suggesting a common weak rheology in both materials. Locally however some more abrupt contacts are however observed. Figs. 6E and S14B show a typical case where folded gneiss enclaves with sharp limits are included in a fine-grained granite, itself intensely stretched. It shows that this part of the intrusion was injected after an intense deformation of the host gneiss that had already cooled to behave more rigidly. This observation reinforces the notion of a continuum of deformation and intrusion during a protracted period and not as a single intrusion.\n\n\n6\nThe Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia MCC and the NCDS\nThe geometry and kinematic data presented above complete our knowledge on the Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia MCC so far mostly limited to the large intrusion that roofs the topmost parts of the migmatite dome on Mykonos, except for the works of Lucas (1999) and Den\u00e8le et al. (2011). Fig. 11 shows a schematic cross-section through the whole MCC, from the muscovite gneiss along the western coast of Rheneia to the Mykonos Detachment and the Late Miocene supra-detachment basin cropping out in the northeast of Mykonos. The migmatite dome crops out from the east of Rheneia to the Apollonia peninsula in western Mykonos. As discussed in Den\u00e8le et al. (2011), the composite Mykonos laccolith roots within the dome in Delos and Rheneia. On the cross-section, the strike-slip faults inferred on the geological map along the Delos Strait have been simplified for the sake of clarity but they indeed offset laterally and vertically the gneiss-granite contact. Only one late fault is shown between Mykonos and Delos. The core of the dome is not affected by the brittle deformation associated with the detachment, but is has recorded the ductile E\u2013W stretching and folding before and during the emplacement of the pluton. The N\u2013S evolution of the attitude of foliation on Delos shows large-scale undulations with axes parallel to the regional stretching as well. These fold with their axes parallel to the stretching direction relate to a component of N\u2013S shortening (constriction).\nThe fabric associated with the E\u2013W stretching is thus observed in all lithologies, from the migmatites to the gneiss and the intrusive granites. It is active at high temperature in the migmatites and in the intrusions at the magmatic stage and continues in lower-temperature conditions in the amphibolitic enclaves showing greenschist-facies stretching. It was thus active during the exhumation of the core of the dome. As proposed earlier by Faure et al. (1991), the direction of stretching is parallel to the long axis of the dome, like on Naxos, thus making the MDR a a-type MCC (Jolivet et al., 2004a, 2004b).\nThe enrichment of the intrusion in mafic enclaves toward the south, and the loss of a strong fabric may suggest that the roots of the pluton are in the southern part of Delos and Rheneia, a situation that can be compared to the Serifos pluton (Rabillard et al., 2015). Previous studies concluded after Lucas (1999) that the root zone was in the center of Delos because the foliation is steeper there (Den\u00e8le et al., 2011) but the attitude of the foliation is for a great part due to late folding during exhumation and the root zone is wide. The deformation recorded in the migmatites continued during the emplacement of the pluton with the same direction of stretching and the same general geometry of folding. Folds with E\u2013W axes and steep axial planes are observed both in the migmatites and in the granite itself where the foliation attitude varies from vertical to horizontal with a very consistent E\u2013W trending lineation as shown on the map of Figs. 3 and 9. The geometry of folds however evolves from deep to more superficial levels. The detachment itself and the silicified breccia underneath are folded with axes parallel to the stretching direction and the folds are broadly open, while the migmatites and the granite display tighter folds and steep foliations in the core of the dome. This same observation can be made in the larger dome of Naxos (Kruckenberg et al., 2011).\nThe Rheneia Shear Zone extends from Rheneia to Delos but is not observed on Mykonos that is structurally higher. Its general dip is toward the west. The sense of shear has been drawn top-to-the east on the cross-section based on the kinematic indicators we could observe but this remains to be ascertained. It has certainly accommodated an intense flattening and an intense non-coaxial shearing as illustrated by the presence of folds with axes parallel to stretching, but a component of shear with the opposite sense would not be illogical given the general attitude of the shear zone with its westward dip. The Rheneia Shear Zone can thus be either a tilted top-to-the east shear zone accommodating a part of the general shearing deformation associated with the detachment, or a conjugate shear zone accommodating the rising of the dome in the footwall of the detachment.\n\n\n7\nDiscussion, evolution of the MCC\nThe complete cross-section from Rheneia to Mykonos thus shows the progressive stretching of the crust from the formation of a lower crustal migmatitic dome and its exhumation, to the syn-tectonic intrusion of a granitic laccolith in ductile conditions in the core of the dome and the progressive shearing of the upper part of the system, including the laccolith by the NCDS, first in ductile conditions (Livada Detachment) and then in brittle conditions (Mykonos Detachment), until the deposition of a supra-detachment basin in the Late Miocene and emplacement of a system of baryte and iron hydroxide dykes during cooling and late brittle deformation (Fig. 14\n). This continuum preserves the same stretching direction all along the exhumation process (e.g. Lecomte et al., 2010; Menant et al., 2013).\n\nFig. 15\n shows a kinematic evolution in four stages along this cross-section. The general situation is similar to most other Aegean plutons as synthetized in Rabillard et al. (2017). A pluton rises within a ductile dome where the crust is partially molten and invades the dome below the NCDS (Figs. 9 & 11). The part of the pluton directly alimented locally by partial melting of the gneiss is unknown but probably quite significant when considering the gradual transition between the pluton and the migmatitic gneiss observed on Mykonos (Fig. S1). The relative motion of the rising dome with respect to the hanging-wall of the detachment induces a top-to-the east shearing distributed within a large part of the laccolith, from co-magmatic deformation to sub-solidus mylonitization below the detachment. The opposite side of the dome is intensely deformed in ductile conditions by the thick Rheneia Shear Zone but the sense of shear is not ascertained, either synthetic of the top-to-the east shearing of the detachment or top-to-the west, conjugate of the detachment and accommodating the dome rise. The kinematic indicators we have observed however suggest a top-to-the east sense of shear and we shall consider this solution in the following. Whatever the structural level, from the deep migmatitic dome to the supra-detachment basin, the same direction of stretching and the same direction of fold axes are preserved. A component of constriction perpendicular to the stretching direction controls the formation of these folds, which style evolves from top to base, from open to tight folds, like in other MCC in the Aegean region, especially Naxos (e.g. Vanderhaeghe, 2004). These folds accommodate the same direction of shortening perpendicular to the main stretching direction all along the extension stage and exhumation history of the dome. In Mykonos, the contemporaneity of the formation of migmatites and the intrusion shows that partial melting and coeval folding are both young, dating from the Middle and Late Miocene, as shown by U-Pb ages on zircon and lower temperature methods (13\u22129 Ma; Brichau et al., 2008).\nIn both cases, MDR and Naxos, folds with vertical axial planes are tighter at depth than in the upper structures suggesting a more intense constriction in the deep parts of the MCC. This constrictional component is expected in a-type domes formed with a component of strike-slip motion at the boundary of the system (Le Pourhiet et al., 2012). To explain the shorter wavelength of folds in the core of the MCC an alternative solution might be proposed. The observed folding affects alternating layers of variable competence and the rheological contrast is probably very small in the partially molten domains as seen above. The wavelength of folds depends upon the layers thickness and the viscosity contrast between layers. If this contrast is small the wavelength should be small and the folds thus tighter.\nThe observations made in this study in Rheneia and Delos show the deep parts of the dome and the interactions in hot and ductile conditions with the intrusion, conditions that are not met in other Aegean domes. Most other examples show the ductile deformation associated with the lower detachment and the co-magmatic deformation in the root zone of the pluton, but not the hot interactions between the migmatites and the intrusions. In all cases except Rheneia and Delos, the observations show a sharp intrusive contact between the intrusion and the dome or with upper crustal levels with evidence of contact metamorphism at the contact, as in Naxos or Tinos, showing that the visible part of the granitoid intruded a dome that had already cooled down (Jansen, 1977; Br\u00f6cker and Franz, 1994; Jolivet and Patriat, 1999). In Naxos, the presence of large septas of ductilely deformed migmatitic gneiss within the granodioritic pluton at short distance from the contact (Bessi\u00e8re et al., 2017) testifies for the same sort of interactions between the pluton and the dome at depth, but they are not preserved as on Delos and Rheneia. This same situation is observed on Mykonos with the intrusion of the granite in the Upper Cycladic Unit metabasite in the vicinity of the Livada Detachment (Jolivet et al., 2010; Lecomte et al., 2010). The only other case where the hot contact between the migmatite dome and the intrusion could be observed is Ikaria where the hot contact between the Karkinagrion leucogranite and the Miocene migmatite can be mapped but only in a restricted area (Beaudoin et al., 2015; Laurent et al., 2015). The case of Rheneia and Delos is thus a unique example in the Aegean to study the hot interactions between a rising pluton and its root zone within a migmatite dome because erosion reached much deeper levels of the MCC.\nThe contact zone observed on Delos between the granite and the migmatite shows a fuzzy transition with alternation of stromatic migmatites and granitic layers, both the migmatite and the granite being deformed with the same foliation and lineation direction. The flow within the granite and the ductile deformation in the partially-molten gneiss are parallel, suggesting a very weak behavior of the gneiss when they are partially molten. In-situ melting of the gneiss is observed in the core of folds. Gneiss and marble enclaves of various size from a few cm to several hundred meters included within the granite show the same direction of stretching and the same foliation as the surrounding granite, also suggesting that the molten basement and the intrusion had similar rheologies at the time of inclusion. This observation is however not true everywhere as some sharp contacts between the gneiss with a preserved ductile deformation and the stretched granite show that the interactions between the gneiss and the intrusion have lasted long enough to record a succession of magma batches during the same deformation event, the most recent ones arriving once the host rock was already cooler and thus more rigid. This is confirmed by the sharp contacts observed on Rheneia between the coarse granitic dykes near the main pluton and the biotite-gneiss, the host-rock and the dykes being intensely stretched along the regional X-direction. All these observations show a continuum of intrusion and coeval deformation during exhumation and cooling.\nThe Delos granite is intensely stretched and foliated in the central part in the vicinity of the sanctuary and south of it. The orientation of the feldspar megacrysts is parallel to the foliation in large migmatite enclaves and the transition from fuzzy diatexites to oriented granite with schlieren is progressive. This shows again that the rheologies of the molten gneiss and the pluton were not much different at the time of intrusion.\nThe significance of the biotite-gneiss and muscovite-gneiss must then be discussed. We observe a transition from gneiss intensely injected by dykes toward regularly laminated gneiss with alternation of leucocratic layers within the gneissic host rock, both in biotite- and muscovite gneiss. The most intense transposition is observed along the contact between these two types of gneiss and we interpret the transition as a thick shear zone, which we have named the Rheneia Shear Zone. One can then wonder how much of the layering observed in general in these gneiss, especially at a distance from the RSZ, is actually the result of the activity of the shear zone or an inheritance from an older deformation episode. Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) have interpreted the muscovite-gneiss of northern Rheneia as migmatitic. We do not follow this interpretation in this paper but it remains possible that the regular layering of these gneiss results from the recent shearing deformation of migmatitic gneiss, which would indicate a considerably thicker shear zone. Further field observations and sampling for dating with a range of radiochronological methods are required to answer this question.\nThe case-study of the MDR MCC thus shows a progressive transition from a weak dome where the intrusive granite has a rheology not much different from the partially molten host-rock to ultra-mylonites and brittle deformation along the main detachment. A continuum of deformation with E\u2013W stretching and perpendicular shortening is observed from the ductile to the brittle stage. The intrusion of the granite within the dome is first associated with massive inclusion of ductile basement septas in the magma and progressive transitions between the granite and the migmatites are observed. While the whole system is exhumed and cools down, the granitic magma is emplaced within dykes of various scales while the same deformation continues. These dykes are observed all around the migmatite dome and the pluton and they intrude even the UCU at the top of the system. A thick shear zone forms above the dome, transposing the dykes. This lasts until the deformation localizes along a single detachment plane, the Mykonos Detachment and brittle formation of large Ba-Fe veins accompanies hydrothermal circulations during syn-kinematic cooling.\nThe duration of this progressive deformation is likely to be short. Observations show that the pluton and the migmatites are at least partly coeval. The age of the pluton is dated at 13 Ma using U-Pb on zircons on Mykonos and the brittle activity of the Mykonos Detachment between 13 and 9 Ma using mid- to low-temperature thermochronology (Brichau et al., 2008). The activity of the detachment, the formation of the Late Miocene Basin and the emplacement of the barite and iron-hydroxides ore lasted until \u223c9 Ma (Menant et al., 2013). 4 Myrs only thus separate the first intrusion from the end of extensional deformation along the NCDS. The age of the first extension in the Aegean started at \u223c30 Ma (Jolivet and Brun, 2010) or 21 Ma (Ring et al., 2010). Migmatites in the nearby Naxos-Paros dome has yielded ages as old as 20 Ma (Keay et al., 2001) but ages as young as 16 Ma have also been recovered on zircon rims (Martin et al., 2006) and late dykes cutting across the dome yielded even younger ages at ca. 13 Ma (Vanderhaeghe et al., 2018). More recent work by Ring et al. (2018) suggest that ages older than 18 Ma are affected by some inheritance of older events and that the mean age for partial melting is about 14 Ma. On Ikaria the age of partial melting has been dated around 15\u201316 Ma (Beaudoin et al., 2015), similar to age of the oldest granitic pluton there (Bolhar et al., 2010). Partial melting in MDR thus probably started before the intrusion of the granite at 13 Ma but was still active at that time.\nThe pattern of stretching lineations (Figs. 3 and 10) seen across the MDR MCC shows a progressive rotation from E\u2013W on Delos and Rheneia to NESW in the eastern part of Mykonos. This rotation had already been noticed by Den\u00e8le et al. (2011) who advocated for differential rotation during exhumation of the upper and lower portions of the crust. Paleomagnetic investigations in the Cyclades have indeed shown rotation about vertical axes of the plutonic bodies (Morris and Anderson, 1996; Avigad et al., 1998). The data suggest a clockwise rotation of the Mykonos pluton by about 22\u00b0. Avigad et al. (1998) used these evidence to suggest a decoupling between upper and lower crust during extension. The different orientation of stretching lineations in the northwest Cyclades (Tinos, Andros) and in the central Cyclades led Walcott and White (1998) to emphasize the importance of the so-called Mid-Cycladic Lineament, a complex strike-slip system that would separate two rigid blocks in the Cyclades. Le Pourhiet et al. (2012) show that a component of strike-slip distributed in the crust above a slab tear can explain the formation of a-type domes with their long axis parallel to the main direction of stretching and Jolivet et al. (2021) show that in such models the pattern of stretching lineations shows rotations in space compatible with the sense of this strike-slip motion. This change in stretching direction seen from Rheneia to eastern Mykonos should be reinterpreted in the framework of the slab tear that occurred underneath the eastern Aegean region between 15 and 8 Ma (Jolivet et al., 2015), including the full lineation map at the scale of the Cyclades and Western Anatolia.\n\n\n8\nConclusion\nThe Mykonos-Delos-Rheneia MCC shows a unique example in the Aegean of the high-temperature interactions between a migmatitic dome intruded by a set of syn-kinematic intrusions in the footwall of a major low-angle detachment during a short period of a few Myrs. Compared to other MCC in the Cyclades, the MDR MCC better shows the deep parts of the dome where the intrusive rocks and the partially molten rocks of the dome have similar rheological parameters. The Naxos dome also shows a pluton intruding a migmatitic dome but the granodiorite is not seen in contact with the migmatitic core. The granodiorite intrusion instead pierces the outer parts of the dome. The MDR MCC thus allows describing the full evolution from the first intrusion of the pluton in the middle or lower crust to the extreme localization of deformation along a single detachment plane in the upper crust, all the way to the deposition of a supra-detachment basin invaded by hydrothermal venues during the last cooling steps. The whole extension process, from the ductile regime to the last brittle increment, was achieved with the same E\u2013W stretching direction associated with E\u2013W trending fold axes. The tightening of folds increase from the superficial one affecting the detachment to the deep ductile ones in the core of the migmatite dome. The intrusion starts at depth in hot conditions within the partially molten crust and the contact shows parallel flows in the granite and the migmatites indicating similar rheological behaviors between the deep molten crust and the intrusion. Large pieces of the molten gneiss and marbles are included in hot conditions within the pluton and the transition between the granite and the migmatite is often progressive. The exhumation of the dome was accompanied with the formation of a newly described thick shear zone enveloping the migmatitic core, the Rheneia Shear Zone. The presence of the shear zone is shown by the intense deformation of acidic dykes issued from the main granitic body and the core of the shear zone corresponds to the contact between the lower biotite-gneiss and the upper muscovite gneiss. The sense of shear is locally top-to-the east but additional observations are required to confirm this conclusion. The thickness of the shear zone is also questionable as a part of the upper Rheneia gneiss could actually be part of the shear zone.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nLaurent Jolivet, Violaine Sautter, Isabelle Moretti, Tommy Vettor, Zozi Papadopulou, Romain Augier and Laurent Arbaret did the field work, discussed the observations and wrote the manuscript.

This relation is the reason why slip rates are one of the most sensitive inputs for seismic hazard assessment models (Cornell, 1968; McGuire, 2007, among many others). In regions with low deformation rates, most seismic hazard assessments are based on geological evidence providing long-term fault slip rates (e.g., Faure Walker et al., 2010). These rates summarize multi-millennial records of cumulative earthquake displacements and cover multiple seismic cycles, yielding average recurrence intervals for individual faults. In recent years, this approach has been complemented with data from local GPS networks. These networks provide present deformation rates and, hence, short-term slip rates that are helpful to estimate the seismic potential of active faults. Further analyses of local GPS networks are also an open window to geodynamical processes at the millimetric level (e.g., Larson et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004; Kouba, 2005; Hreinsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2006).\nThe Betic Cordillera (Fig. 1\n) is located in the western Mediterranean region, where the Nubian and Eurasian plates slowly converge. This active convergence is responsible for the development of more than one hundred active faults. Most of the quantitative deformation data related to these faults are geologically derived long-term slip rates (Garc\u00eda-Mayordomo et al., 2012; Pedrera et al., 2012; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2020). Geodetic short-term slip rates in the Betic Cordillera related to individual faults are scarce. The first geodetic data of slip rates were initially obtained from high-precision levelling profiles, providing vertical uplift rates for faults located in the Eastern Betic Cordillera (Gim\u00e9nez, 1998; Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2009). In the last two decades, several local GPS networks have been established in different areas: along the Carboneras and Alhama de Murcia Faults (Colomina et al., 1998; Echeverria et al., 2013, 2015), the Padul Fault (Gil et al., 2002 and 2017; Ruiz et al., 2003), the Bajo Segura and Crevillente Faults (Borque et al., 2019), the Zafarraya Fault (Galindo Zald\u00edvar et al., 2003), the Balanegra Fault (Marin-Lechado et al., 2010; Galindo-Zaldivar et al., 2013), and the Baza and Galera Faults (this study). Until now, these local GPS networks have provided only a few short-term fault slip rates: 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 mm\/yr for the Alhama de Murcia Fault (Echeverria et al., 2013), 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mm\/yr for the Carboneras Fault (Echeverria et al., 2015), \u223c0.9 mm\/yr for the Padul Fault (Gil et al., 2017), 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mm\/yr for the Bajo Segura Fault (Borque et al., 2019) and 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 mm\/yr for the Crevillente Fault (Borque et al., 2019).\nIn the present work, we provide new data from a local GPS network in the Baza sub-Basin (BsB), a key area located in the transition zone between two major tectonic domains of the Betic Cordillera. In this area, two active faults have been described, the Baza and Galera Faults (Alfaro et al., 2008; Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011). Only long-term geological and geomorphological slip rates have been previously reported for these two active structures. Our geodetic data permit us to estimate the velocity field in the BsB, to interpret these velocities in terms of fault kinematics and to constrain the short-term fault slip rates. In addition, we compare our GPS-derived short-term slip rates with long-term geological rates to derive implications for seismic hazard assessment. We also propose a local tectonic model involving both faults that could be incorporated into future regional geodynamic interpretations and that has further implications for seismic hazard analyses.\n\n\n2\nRegional geodynamic setting\nThe western Mediterranean area (Fig. 1) is characterized by NNW-SSE convergence of the Nubian and Eurasian plates, as mentioned above. The convergence rate is approximately 5\u22126 mm\/yr according to several regional geodetic studies (Nocquet and Calais, 2003; McClusky et al., 2003; Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et al., 2006, 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010; Nocquet, 2012). This convergence is not uniformly distributed (Serpelloni et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010; Vernant et al., 2010; Koulali et al., 2011; Spakman et al., 2018, among others), as approximately two-thirds of the convergence is accommodated in the southern margin (North Africa) and only one-third is accommodated in the northern margin (Betic Cordillera and Algero-Balearic Basin).\nUnder this convergent setting, two major tectonic domains can be distinguished in the Betic Cordillera: i) the Eastern Betic Cordillera, dominated by active strike-slip tectonics (Bousquet, 1979; De Larouzi\u00e8re et al., 1988; Silva et al., 1993), and ii) the Central Betic Cordillera, dominated by active NE-SW to ENE-WSW extension (Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 1993; Stich et al., 2006, 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010). Our study area, the BsB, is located in the transition zone between these two major tectonic domains (Figs. 1 and 2\n).\nTo the east of the BsB (Fig. 1), the Eastern Betic Cordillera is dominated by active strike-slip tectonics (Bousquet, 1979; De Larouzi\u00e8re et al., 1988; Silva et al., 1993), probably related to the presence of a thin and rigid crustal indenter in the Algero-Balearic Basin (Coppier et al., 1989; Palano et al., 2015; Borque et al., 2019). Active structures in the Eastern Betic Cordillera constitute the Eastern Betic Shear Zone (Bousquet, 1979; De Larouzi\u00e8re et al., 1988; Silva et al., 1993). In this left-lateral tectonic band, the strike of the active faults grades northwards from NNE-SSW to NE-SW and then to ENE-WSW. Active faults in the Eastern Betic Shear Zone were responsible for major earthquakes, such as the 1829 Torrevieja earthquake (I = IXX, Mms = 6.6) and the 2011 Lorca earthquake (I = VIII, Mw = 5.1).\nTo the west of the BsB (Fig. 1), the Central Betic Cordillera is dominated by active ENE-WSW extension (Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 1993; Stich et al., 2006, 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010). This extension has been explained as related to active subduction with rollback (e.g., Gutscher et al., 2002; Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2015), deep-seated delamination processes (e.g., Fadil et al., 2006; P\u00e9rouse et al., 2010; Petit et al., 2015; Baratin et al., 2016; among others) or slab drag (Spakman et al., 2018). The active extension is mainly accommodated by NNW-SSE to WNW-ENE high-angle normal faults (Galindo Zald\u00edvar et al., 2003). Some of these active faults are the seismogenic sources of several of the larger earthquakes that have occurred in the Iberian Peninsula, such as the 1884 Andalusian earthquake (I = VIII-IX, Mms = 6.5), the 1531 Baza earthquake (I = VIII-IX, Mms = 6.0), and the 1956 Purchil earthquake (mD = 5.0). In the Central Betic Cordillera, regional geodetic analyses quantified the broad extension to between \u223c2.1 and \u223c3.7 mm\/yr (Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010; Ruano and da Silva Fernandes, 2020). Discrepancies in these regional extensional rates are related to the area considered in the studies cited above. Data from the Topo-Iberia project obtained from continuous GPS (CGPS) stations indicate that displacement of the Central and Eastern Betic Cordillera is westward (with a southwestward component) in relation to stable Eurasia (Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2015). These CGPS data also indicate that displacement significantly increases southwards and westwards (Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2015). However, the regional scale of these studies hinders the relation of these extensional rates to specific faults.\n\n\n3\nActive faults of the Baza sub-Basin\nTwo major active faults have been described in the BsB: the normal Baza Fault and the strike-slip Galera Fault (Alfaro et al., 2008; Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011; Medina-Cascales et al., 2020) Fig. 2). The largest recorded earthquake in the BsB is the historical 1531 Baza earthquake (I = VIII-IX; Mw = 6.0). This earthquake, responsible for 310 deaths and the destruction of the city of Baza (Olivera Serrano, 1995), was likely produced by the Baza Fault (Alfaro et al., 2008; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2012). In the instrumental record, the larger earthquakes are the 1962 Caniles event (mbLg = 4.7, probably related to the Baza Fault) and the 1964 Galera earthquake (mbLg = 4.8, probably related to the Galera Fault). Recently, Castro et al. (2018) postulated a palaeoseismic history of the Baza Fault involving 8 or 9 surface-rupturing events for the last 45 kyr.\nThe Baza Fault is a 40 km-long normal fault, with a mean strike of N155E and dips ranging between 45\u00b0 and 65 \u00b0E (Alfaro et al., 2008; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2012; Haberland et al., 2017). Faulting initiated in the late Miocene (ca. 8 Ma), producing a cumulative vertical throw of \u223c2000 m. The Baza Fault developed a half-graben in the hanging wall (Alfaro et al., 2008; Haberland et al., 2017). At the surface, the Baza Fault consists of a fault array with variable width and a variable number of sub-parallel strands. The Baza Fault can be divided into two main sections (Fig. 2): a narrow N010E-striking north section and a N135E-striking south section that widens southwards. The long-term geological slip rate of the Baza Fault ranges between 0.2 and 0.7 mm\/yr (Alfaro et al., 2008; Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2012). Higher slip rates have also been proposed for the Baza Fault (Fern\u00e1ndez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2010). However, these higher values are based on a geomorphological marker that was recently reinterpreted as older (Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011); hence, slip rates should also be reinterpreted as within the abovementioned range.\nThe Galera Fault is a 25 km-long structure striking N065E. Scarce geological kinematic indicators seem to show that the Galera Fault presents left-lateral kinematics with a minor vertical component (Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011). The only geological quantitative data point to a vertical slip rate ranging between \u223c0.08 and \u223c0.24 mm\/yr (Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011). For the Galera Fault, the only reported slip rate refers to the minor vertical component of the total displacement. This long-term geological vertical slip rate ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 mm\/yr (Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011). The lateral (main) long-term slip rate of the Galera Fault remains unknown.\n\n\n4\nGPS sites, data processing and velocity field estimation\n\n4.1\nGPS network and data processing\nIn 2008, we built a GPS network that includes six sites (Fig. 2). We located the sites as far as possible of fault traces and on the different blocks of the active faults in the study area. To guarantee the same placement of the GPS antennas in each campaign, we used exposed rocks and self-centring mounting devices. We completed six GPS field campaigns in September 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015. The sites were observed for a continuous 96 -h interval in each campaign. The equipment that we used in the 2009 and 2010 campaigns consisted of Leica Geosystem GX1230 receivers and LEIAX1202 antennas, whereas we observed the 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015 campaigns using LEICA Geosystem AR10 receivers with LEIAR10 antennas. To process the GPS data, we used GIPSY 6.4 in Precise Point Positioning mode. GIPSY is a GNSS-inferred positioning system and orbit analysis simulation software package developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (https:\/\/gipsy-oasis.jpl.nasa.gov\/). We followed the processing strategy described in Bertiger et al. (2010) with zero-ambiguity resolution and an identical standard procedure for all campaigns (S\u00e1nchez-Alzola et al., 2014). This GPS processing included the use of JPL final ephemeris and Pole products in the same IGS08 reference frame and the introduction of the FES2004 ocean tide loading model from Lyard et al. (2006). We also applied hydrostatic and wet components of the zenith tropospheric delay and a 10-degree cut-off angle and the calibration parameters for the antenna phase centre.\n\n\n4.2\nGPS position time series and velocity field estimation\nWe represented the position time series to fit the best trend line for each site of the network. We applied linear regression considering the change in antennas between the 2011 and 2012 campaigns, which produced a shift in the time series. Fig. 3\n shows the GPS position time series in horizontal components (north and east) in the IGS08 frame for all of the sites in millimetres. The model applied to the original time series, using weighted least squares, consists of an intercept, a linear trend (site velocity) and an offset to account for an antenna change. The error term in these time series is composed of uncorrelated random errors (white noise) and temporally correlated random errors (coloured noise). The temporal correlation is described by a random-walk process. We have assumed a typical magnitude for this process of 1.0 mm\/\u221ayr. We are aware that a rigorous statistical analysis and a proper fit to the data are essential to obtain a solid and accurate understanding of crustal deformation analysis. The GPS-derived site rates and uncertainties are shown in Table 1\n. Fig. 2 shows the absolute velocity field from the position time series in the IGS08 reference frame. A more effective representation of the velocity field was estimated through the residual velocities with respect to stable Eurasia. We computed the residual velocity field considering the ITRF2008 plate motion model (Altamimi et al., 2011) with the Eurasian plate as fixed (Fig. 4\n). The main issue with the GPS-derived residual velocities used in our interpretation is that they are quite small (sub-mm) but are non-zero at the 95 % confidence level (Table 1).\n\n\n\n5\nFault slip rates\nAll of the sites located in the BsB move towards the WSW at different rates with respect to stable Eurasia (Fig. 4), i.e., roughly perpendicular to the convergence direction between the Nubian and Eurasian plates (N323E \u00b1 1.8; Argus et al., 2011). The residual velocity vectors that we obtained (Fig. 4) can be preliminarily grouped into two sets according to their values. i) Vectors set 1 has residual velocities (E component) ranging between -1.2 \u00b1 0.5 and -1.4 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr; this first set includes sites 5200, 5500, and 5700 (Fig. 4, Table 1). ii) Set 2 includes vectors with velocities (E component) ranging between -0.7 \u00b1 0.6 and -0.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm\/yr; this second set comprises sites 5100, 5400, and 5600 (Fig. 4, Table 1). Set 1 includes sites located in the footwall of the Baza Fault and the north block of the Galera Fault. Set 2 includes sites located in the hanging wall of the Baza Fault and the south block of the Galera Fault (Fig. 4).\nTo discuss these residual velocities in terms of fault slip rates and kinematics, we projected the obtained vectors along the N065E direction, which is sub-perpendicular to the mean strike of the Baza Fault and parallel to the Galera Fault (Fig. 5\n, Table 1).\n\n5.1\nBaza Fault slip rate\nTo interpret the GPS-derived velocities in terms of the Baza Fault slip rate, we first subtract the residual velocities of stations located to the west and east of the Baza Fault along two profiles. The first profile cross-cuts the north section of the Baza Fault, as it involves sites 5500 and 5400 (Fig. 5). After this analysis, we obtain a value for the N065E component of the motion of VN-N065E = 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 2\n). The second profile cross-cuts the south section of the Baza Fault, as it involves sites 5100 and 5200 (Fig. 5). In this case, our analyses yield a velocity of VS-N065E = 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 2).\nThese values seem to indicate less extension in the south section of the Baza Fault than in the north section. We must be cautious due to the low signal-to-noise ratio observed at the 95 % confidence level, but this lower extension rate in the south section of the Baza fault is consistent with geologic, geomorphologic and geophysical data, as (1) the geomorphic expression of the fault scarp is subtler towards the south (Garc\u00eda-Tortosa et al., 2008), (2) the total displacement of recent geologic markers is less in the south section (Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al., 2011), and (3) subsurface data also indicate that the total cumulative throw of the Baza Fault is lower in the south section (Alfaro et al., 2008; Haberland et al., 2017). The lower velocity computed along the second profile could also be related to the relative location with respect to the fault tip line. Faults tend to present maximum displacement in their central part that gradually decreases towards the tips (Barnett et al., 1987; Ferill and Morris, 2001, among many others). The second profile (in the south section of the Baza Fault) is located closer to the southern fault tip line than the first profile (in the north section of the Baza Fault) is to the northern tip line (Fig. 5); therefore, a lower velocity is expected along the southern profile.\nAfter the above analysis, we use a simple geometrical calculation to compute the short-term slip rate of the Baza Fault for the first time. For this computation, we use the short-term displacement rates of the N065E components of motion for the north and south sections (VN-N065E = 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr and VS-N065E = 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr, respectively; Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 2). In addition, we consider dips of the Baza Fault ranging between 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, according to both surface and subsurface data (Alfaro et al., 2008; Haberland et al., 2017). We obtain a slip rate on the north section ranging between 0.9 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 45\u00b0) and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 60\u00b0) (Table 2). Analogously, for the south section, we obtain slip rates ranging between 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 45\u00b0) and 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 60\u00b0) (Table 2).\n\n\n5.2\nGalera Fault slip rate\nTo analyse the slip rate of the strike-slip Galera Fault we also used the N065E (fault direction) projected component of motion of GPS-derived velocities. In this case, we subtract the residual velocities of the stations located to the north (site 5700) and to the south (site 5600) of the Galera Fault (Fig. 4). After this analysis, we obtain a value of the N065E component of the motion of VN065E = 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 2). This value indicates that the Galera Fault presents a sinistral strike-slip component. Once again, these are the first quantitative strike-slip rates attributed to the Galera Fault, as previous geological studies quantified only the vertical component of the fault. In any case, geological vertical slip rates (ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 mm\/yr; Garc\u00eda-Tortosa et al., 2008, 2011; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2012) are significantly lower than our GPS-derived strike-slip rates. Consequently, our data further support the interpretation of the Galera Fault as a strike-slip fault with a minor dip-slip component. Our GPS-derived residual velocities are not accurate enough to analyse the perpendicular-to- strike component of movement (transpression or transtension) of the Galera Fault.\n\n\n\n6\nDiscussion\nIn this section, we discuss the implications of the results obtained from our GPS network for the tectonic setting and seismic hazard assessment of this key geodynamic region of the Betic Cordillera.\n\n6.1\nReconciling geologic and geodetic fault slip rates\nOur GPS-derived data permit us to establish a short-term slip rate on the Baza Fault ranging between 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr (north section, dip 60\u00b0) and 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr (south section, dip 45\u00b0) (Table 2). Alfaro et al. (2008) and Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al. (2011) presented the total cumulative throw for stratigraphic and geomorphic markers. With these total throws and the ages of these markers proposed by the abovementioned authors, the long-term slip rate ranges between 0.2 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 60\u00b0) and 0.7 mm\/yr (assuming a dip of 45\u00b0). Despite the high uncertainties of these values, the slip rates that we obtain are within the range of those proposed by Alfaro et al. (2008) and Garc\u00eda Tortosa et al. (2011). However, we cannot rule out that the geodetic short-term slip rates are higher than the geologic slip rates, particularly for the north section of the Baza Fault. We postulate that the higher short-term geodetic slip rates that we observe on the Baza Fault are real and not an artefact related to the low signal-to-noise ratio observed at the 95 % confidence level. Discrepancies between slip rates derived from different sources are not uncommon (e.g. Oskin et al., 2008; Cowgill et al., 2009). In fact, a scientific debate continues about whether these discrepancies are related to temporal and\/or spatial variations in fault activity or are merely the result of the observational limitations of the measurement techniques. Discrepancies between geodetic and geologic slip rates have been explained using a viscoelastic earthquake cycle model (Nur and Mavko, 1974; Savage and Prescott, 1978; Ray and Kaj, 2011; Tong et al., 2014). In this model, steady-state crustal motion is perturbed after a significant earthquake because of a viscoelastic relaxation. That is, the surface strain rate increases after an earthquake and gradually decreases over time. This could be the case for the Baza Fault; however, because of the approximately 500 years elapsed since the last significant earthquake (a magnitude of circa 6 for the 1531 Baza Earthquake), we consider unlikely that postseismic relaxation is still affecting the GPS velocities close to the fault. An alternative interpretation for these discrepancies could be related to slip rate variations. In recent years, much evidence seems to indicate that normal fault slip rates vary in both time and space (Nicol et al., 2006; McClymont et al., 2009; Schlagenhauf et al., 2010, among many others). If this is the case for the Baza Fault, our GPS-derived short-term slip rate would indicate that the fault is presently in a period with a displacement rate higher than the mean of the magnitude 6 seismic cycle (i.e., higher than the long-term slip rate). This interpretation would increase the short-term seismic hazard of the region assuming that higher-than-average slip rates are more likely to trigger smaller magnitude events, e.g., in the range of Mw 5, which could also cause much damage to local populations.\n\n\n6.2\nDisplacement transfer between the Baza and Galera Faults\nThe Baza and Galera Faults constitute an active fault system in the BsB (Fig. 2). The interaction of synchronously active faults implies a transfer of displacement between them (e.g., Dahlstrom, 1969; Walsh and Watterson, 1991). Moreover, in active fault systems where different types of faults coexist, kinematic coherence is expected; that is, the displacement rates of the interacting faults should be interdependent. Analyses of kinematic coherence within fault systems are usually approached by applying field data to elucidate fault attitudes, slip directions and displacement rates (Mouslopoulou et al., 2006 and 2008; Nicol et al., 2010). In the BsB, our GPS data provide slip rates that permit us to analyse how displacement is transferred between the normal Baza Fault and the strike-slip Galera Fault, to elucidate whether the fault system is kinematically coherent.\nAs previously mentioned, the residual velocity vectors that we obtained can be grouped into two sets (Fig. 4, Table 1): i) set 1 comprising sites 5200, 5500, and 5700 with higher residual velocities (E component between -1.2 \u00b1 0.5 and -1.4 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr) and ii) set 2 including sites 5100, 5400, and 5600 with lower residual velocities (E component ranging between -0.7 \u00b1 0.6 and -0.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm\/yr). Set 1 includes all the sites located in the footwall of the Baza Fault and in the north block of the Galera Fault. Set 2 includes the rest of the sites, i.e., all the sites located in the hanging wall of the Baza Fault and in the south block of the Galera Fault (Fig. 4). According to these observations, and using caution because of the low signal-to-noise ratio observed at the 95 % confidence level, we propose that the BsB could be structured into two main tectonic blocks (Fig. 6\n): i) a southeastern block made up of the hanging wall of the Baza Fault and the south block of the Galera Fault and ii) a northwestern block made up of the footwall of the Baza fault and the north block of the Galera Fault. To test the displacement transfer and kinematic coherence of the BsB fault system, we use our GPS data to analyse the slip azimuths and displacement rates of the Baza and Galera Faults. A requirement in synchronously active fault systems involving only two tectonic blocks is that the slip directions of all faults within the system must be sub-parallel (Mouslopoulou et al., 2006). In the BsB fault system, this slip parallelism is confirmed by our residual velocity vectors, which present a sub-parallel WSW azimuth with respect to stable Eurasia (Fig. 4). Global data compiled by Mouslopoulou et al. (2006) indicate that in kinematically coherent fault systems involving normal and strike-slip faults, extension and strike-slip rates are equal (Fig. 7\n). Our GPS-derived vectors seem to indicate that this is also the case in the BsB fault system, as the extension rates on the normal Baza Fault are within the range of the strike-slip rates on the Galera Fault (VN-N065E = 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr and VN065E = 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr, respectively; Fig. 7 and Table 2).\n\n\n6.3\nRegional tectonic significance of the Baza and Galera Faults\nOur GPS-derived data also permit us to discuss the regional tectonic significance of the Baza and Galera Faults. Sites 5200, 5500, and 5700 (vectors set 1) moves towards the WSW direction faster than sites 5100, 5400, and 5600, (vectors set 2) (Fig. 4), which is in good agreement with the normal kinematics of the Baza Fault and the regional extension of the Central Betic Cordillera. Our data also seem to indicate that no extension occurs east of the Baza Fault. In fact, no major active normal faults have been described in the Eastern Betic Cordillera (Garc\u00eda-Mayordomo et al., 2012; Sanz de Galdeano et al., 2020). Consequently, we postulate that the Baza Fault represents the easternmost limit of the regional extension; hence, the BsB is the transition zone between the two present major tectonic domains of the Betic Cordillera (Fig. 6).\nRegional geodetic analyses have quantified the broad ENE-WSW extension in the Central Betic Cordillera to between \u223c2.1 and \u223c3.7 mm\/yr (Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et al., 2007; P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2010). Our data indicate that the N065E component of motion of the Baza Fault ranges between 0.9 \u00b1 0.4 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr. This implies that the Baza Fault accommodates approximately one-third of the total regional extension, underlining the seismogenic potential of this active structure. Moreover, recent CGPS data from the Topo-Iberia network in the Central Betic Cordillera (Galindo-Zald\u00edvar et al., 2015) indicate that the regional extension in the area located east of the Sierra Nevada is approximately 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr (Fig. 1). Consequently, the Baza Fault accommodates almost all of the extension in this area.\n\n\n6.4\nImplications for seismic hazard assessment\nOur GPS data permit us to quantify short-term slip rates on the Baza and Galera Faults for the first time. These slip rates will facilitate future seismic hazard assessment studies in this region. However, our data also permit us to propose a local tectonic model for the BsB with implications for the seismic potential of this area. As we have already mentioned, the active extension in the Central Betic Cordillera is mainly accommodated by NW-SE normal faults. This deformation is heterogeneously distributed, as areas of active extension are physically separated but kinematically coupled through WSW\u2013ENE strike-slip transfer fault zones (Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006; Pedrera et al., 2006; Galindo-Zaldivar et al., 2013). As discussed above, we interpret the Baza Fault as the main active structure in the BsB accommodating the regional ENE-WSW extension. Moreover, our GPS data also indicate that the Baza and Galera Faults are kinematically linked. In addition, no major normal faults have been described east of the Galera Fault. Consequently, we postulate that the Galera Fault is a transfer fault bounding the margin of an extended area (Fig. 6).\nThe tectonic model discussed above also has implications for the seismic potential of the BsB. Complex ruptures involving multiple faults with a wide range of orientations, senses of movement, slip rates, recurrence intervals and even crossing tectonic domain boundaries have been documented for several historical earthquakes around the world (Matsuda, 1974; Wallace, 1984; Beanland et al., 1989; Sieh et al., 1993; Kurushin et al., 1997; Beavan et al., 2012; Schwartz et al., 2012). The factors contributing to these complex ruptures are being analysed after several events occurred in the last few years, such as the El Mayor-Cucapah 2010 earthquake (Fletcher et al., 2014), the Sumatra 2012 earthquake (Meng et al., 2012), and the Kaikoura 2016 earthquake (Litchfield et al., 2018). Likely factors contributing to complex ruptures include physical linkages between faults and inherited geological structures, among others (Litchfield et al., 2018). Our interpretation of the GPS data indicates that the Baza and Galera Faults are kinematically coupled, pointing to a likely physical linkage between the two faults. Consequently, we postulate that a complex rupture involving both the Baza and Galera Faults should be considered in future seismic hazard assessment studies.\n\n\n\n7\nConclusions\nOur results are the first GPS-derived data obtained from the BsB, a key tectonic area in the Betic Cordillera prone to significant earthquakes. Despite the low signal-to-noise ratios of our residual velocities, which are related to the relatively slow (sub-millimetric) strain rate in this region, the results that we obtain are in good agreement with geological observations and regional geodetic data.\nOur local study quantifies for the first time the short-term slip rates on active faults in this area. We obtain slip rates for the Baza Fault ranging between 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm\/yr. These values seem to be higher than previously reported long-term geological slip rates, indicating that the fault could be presently in a period with a displacement rate higher than the mean of the magnitude 6 seismic cycle. Our analysis provides a slip rate for the lateral (main) component of the Galera Fault (0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/yr) for the first time. Our GPS study also indicates that the Baza Fault accommodates one-third of the regional extension of the Central Betic Cordillera and that this structure represents the easternmost active normal fault in the region.\nThese slip rates will be the basis that will facilitate future seismic hazard assessment studies in this region. In addition, the residual velocities that we obtain seem to indicate that the Baza and Galera Faults are kinematically coherent and that the BsB is structured in two main tectonic blocks with no significant internal deformation. The southeastern block comprises the hanging wall of the Baza Fault and the south block of the Galera Fault, and the northwestern block comprises the footwall of the Baza Fault and the north block of the Galera Fault. This interpretation would also imply that the Baza and Galera Faults are kinematically coupled and physically linked and that a potential complex rupture involving both faults should be considered in seismic hazard assessment studies.\n\n\nAuthor statement\nThe authors declare that the work described in this manuscript has not been published previously, that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder.\n\n","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":"","63":"\n\n1\nIntroduction\nAt 06:11 UTC on April 25, 2015, a \n\nM\nw\n\n 7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal near the city of Gorkha located approximately 80 km northwest of Kathmandu. More than 8000 people were killed and over 10,000 were injured (United States Geological Survey (USGS, 2015; Bilham, 2015). Nepal is located on the subduction collision belt of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The Indian plate is subducting beneath the southern Tibetan plateau at a convergence rate of 17 \n-\n 21 mm\/y (Ader et al., 2012) along the Main Himalaya Thrust (MHT) fault, causing uplift of the Himalayas (Nelson et al., 1996; Hauck et al., 1998). Long-term stress accumulation was the main cause of the earthquake (Feldl and Bilham, 2006). After the earthquake, the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) Project, USGS, China Seismic Network, and other research institutions calculated the focal mechanism solutions, which indicated a shallow dipping thrust fault with a strike of \u223c 290\u00b0 and a dip of 7\u00b0.\nTo obtain the coseismic slip distribution, researchers divided the fault into areas of the same size along the strike and dip, based on a rectangular dislocation (Diao et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Yue et al., 2017; Zha et al., 2017), or on an increasing area size with depth (Wang and Fialko, 2015). However, these fault discretization types often result in slip modeling that is too fine in detail in some parts of the fault plane, introducing slip features that the data cannot constrain; or modeling slip too broadly, when the data can constrain much finer details.\nSome researchers have used triangular dislocation to invert the coseismic slip distribution of the \n\nM\nw\n\n7.8\n Gorkha earthquake. Hayes et al. (2015) conducted finite fault modeling using teleseimic and geodetic data, which show a rupture length of \u223c150 km, a peak slip close to 6 m, and a very prominent up-dip limit to slip just north of Kathmandu. The earthquake is best matched by a plane striking 296\u00b0 and dipping between 5\u00b0 and 6\u00b0. Elliott et al. (2016) proposed a fault model that includes three segments to reflect a ramp \n-\n flat \n-\n ramp geometryfor which the slip distribution calculated showspeak slip of approximately 8 m, for a 140-km-long, 50 \n-\n 60-km-wide rupture. Qiu et al. (2016) found that the slip extended along strike on the shallow decollement for \u223c130 km and the rupture area was bounded at either end by pinch points formed by the two-ramp system merging into a single ramp at either end of the Kathmandu klippe. McNamara et al. (2017) proposed that significant slip was concentrated at a depth of 12.5 \n-\n 22.5 km, with a maximum slip of \u223c 8 m at a depth of 16 km.\nIn this study, we used the Bayesian inversion method to invert the fault geometry (Bagnardi and Hooper, 2018), which uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method to obtaining the posterior probability density function of geometric parameters, and determine the fault geometric parameters and uncertainties. The slip distribution was then inverted by an automated fault discretization method (Barnhart and Lohman, 2010), using InSAR and GPS data.\nThis paper is structured as follows: coseismic measurements for the 2015 Gorkha earthquake are introduced in Section 2; the optimal fault geometry and slip distribution are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively; the dislocation method, the geometry of the MHT, and the regularization are discussed in Section 5; and a brief summary of the study is provided in Section 6.\n\n\n2\nData\n\n2.1\nGPS measurements\nGPS coseismic measurements were obtained from 13 GPS stations in Nepal (Galetzka et al., 2015) and 33 stations in China (Wu et al., 2016) (Fig. 1\n). Six stations located near Kathmandu captured significant coseismic displacements (> 0.2 m) in Nepal. The largest displacement was recorded at station KKN4, with a southward movement reaching \u223c1.8 m and anuplift of \u223c1.3 m. In southern China, the offsets from the GPS measurements show predominantly southward motion.\n\n\n2.2\nInSAR\nThe InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) displacements were derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2 and Sentinal-1A satellite (Table 1\n).\nThe ALOS-2 datawas processed using GMTSAR (Lindsey et al., 2015). Fig. 2\n shows the LOS deformation covering the entire area of Gorkha, which includes two significant deformation quadrants in the seismic zone. The surface deformation in the northern quadrant is dominated by movement away from the satellite with a maximum displacement of \u223c0.7 m, indicating some surface subsidence. In contrast, the surface deformation in the southern quadrant moves toward the satellite with a maximum displacement of \u223c1.2 m, indicating surface uplift.\nWe used the GAMMA software to process the Sentinal-1A SAR images from the European Space Agency (ESA). To remove the topographic phase, shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data with a 30 m resolution was used. We aligned the post-seismic image with the pre-seismic image, finding that the overlapping area of the two images doesnot include the entire deformation area. Only the uplifted area of the Gorkha earthquake could be obtained. The interferogram was filtered using an adaptive filter function and phase unwrapping was performed using the minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithm.\nTo improve the computational feasibility and efficiency, we downsampled the InSAR data using a Quadtree method (J\u00f3nsson et al., 2002), the details of which are listed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n3\nFault geometry estimated using a Bayesian approach\nIn the geophysical inversion, the solution is non-unique because the observations are finite and noisy. Traditional inversion methods only obtain the best single point estimation. Bayesian inversion (Bagnardi and Hooper, 2018) provides a natural framework for solving such problems. Treating the observational data and model parameters as random variables, the prior information of the model can be included in the posterior probability density function (PDF) (Anderson and Segall, 2013), and the inversion problem is transformed into information extraction of posterior probability distribution through Bayesian correlation. The posterior PDF is expressed as follows:\n\n(1)\n\np\n\nm\nd\n\n=\np\n(\nd\n|\nm\n)\n\u00d7\np\n(\nm\n)\n\/\np\n(\nd\n)\n\n\nWhere d is the data vector, m is the model parameters, \np\n(\nd\n|\nm\n)\n is the likelihood function that determines m under the known condition d, \np\n(\nm\n)\n expresses the prior information (in the form of a prior joint PDF) of the model parameters, and p(d) is a constant independent of m.\n\nWhen the errors \n\u2208\n obeys multivariate Gaussian distribution with a zero mean and covariance matrix \n\n\u03a3\nd\n\n, \n\u03b5\n\u223c\nN\n(\n0\n,\n\n\u03a3\nd\n\n)\n, the likelihood function can be calculated as follows:\n\n(2)\n\np\n\nd\nm\n\n=\n\n\n(\n2\n\u03c0\n)\n\n\n-\nN\n\/\n2\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03a3\nd\n\n|\n\n\n-\n1\n\/\n2\n\n\n\u00d7\ne\nx\np\n\n\n-\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n-\nG\nm\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\u03a3\nd\n\n-\n1\n\n\n(\nd\n-\nG\nm\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhere N is the total number of data points and \n\n\u03a3\nd\n\n-\n1\n\n\n is the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix.\nAn efficient way to sample and characterize a posterior probability distribution is through the Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Mosegaard and Tarantola, 1995). Using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hastings, 1970), the sampling can be efficiently controlled such that, after a sufficiently large number of iterations, the density of the samples approximates the posterior distribution.\nWe attempted to use InSAR and GPS data to invert the fault geometry parameters of the Gorkha earthquake. However, the resultsdid not agree well with the seismological constraints, which had a preferred dip that exceeded \n\n18\n\u00b0\n\n. Hayes et al. (2015) explained that these steeply dipping values resulted from inversion tradeoffs between depth and dip, likely occurring because of the poor constraints on horizontal displacements afforded by the InSAR observations that would be significant in a nearly horizontal fault rupture.Therefore, we used only the GPS data to invertthe fault geometry parameters and posterior probability distribution for the fault model parameters, whichare shown in Fig. 3\n.\nThe inversion results containnine source model parameters: the length and width of the rectangular source, depth of the lower edge, dip angle, strike, X and Y coordinates of the midpoint of the lower edge (the origin of the coordinates is the epicenter provided by USGS), strike-slip in the strike direction (Fault StrSlip), and dip-slip in the dip direction (Fault DipSlip). Finally, the best-fit solution was resolved with all model parameters constrained according to their uncertainties. Table 2\n presents the inversion results, which reveal that the coseismic deformation was caused by a fault with a length of 99.92 \n-\n 101.34 km, width of 38.09 km \n-\n 38.29 km, depth of 11.15 \n-\n 12.29 km, dip of 5.37\u00b0 \n-\n 5.60\u00b0, and strike of 283.12\u00b0 \n-\n 283.31\u00b0; The X and Y coordinates of the midpoint of the lower edge convert to 85.439\u00b0 \n-\n 85.445 \u00b0E, 28.061\u00b0 \n-\n 28.063 \u00b0N in the geographic coordinate system. Table 3\n shows a comparison of geometric parameters determined in this study with those from previously published models. Using the best-fit slip model, the simulated GPS displacements are in good agreement with the observations (Fig. 1).The residuals for the stations are within 4 cm in Nepal and the mean residual is 3 cm for the stations in China.\n\n\n4\nInversion of coseismic slip distribution\nBased on the fault geometry in Section 3, the coseismic slip distribution was inverted using an automated fault discretization method (Barnhart and Lohman, 2010), imposing Laplacian regularization from the InSAR and GPS data. We expanded the fault plane into a surface with a 200 km length and a 120 km width. The relative weighting between GPS and InSAR LOS data was determined previously (Wang and Fialko, 2015). The estimated slip distribution shows that the maximum slip of \u223c6.32 m at a depth of \u223c10 km is in good agreement with previous estimates (Wang and Fialko, 2015; Galetzka et al., 2015; Avouac et al., 2015). Significant slip is concentrated at depths of 8 \n-\n 14 km (Fig. 4\n).\nAs shown in Fig. 4a, the coseismic slip is concentrated in a narrow zone, 30 \n-\n 40 km along the dip direction of the fault and, 140 km along the fault strike.There are two peak slips in the slip distribution. The first peak slip of \u223c5.9 m is within the white circle \u201ca\u201d at a depth of \u223c10.2 km; two triangles have a slip of over 5.8 m. The second peak slip of \u223c6.32 m is within the white circle \u201cc\u201d at a depth of \u223c10 km; seven triangles have a slip of over 5.8 m. To verify this, we used the relationship between the slip rate and time from Galetzka et al. (2015, Fig. 4). This shows that a maximum slip rate of 0.67 m\/s and a slip time of 10 s form a peak slip inside circle \u201ca\u201d. A maximum slip rate of 0.98 m\/s and a slip time of 9 s form the other peak slip inside circle \u201cc\u201d. Inside circle \u201cb\u201d, the maximum slip rate is 1.03 m\/s and the slip time is 6.2 s, the accumulated maximum slip is less than the maximum slips of circles \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d.\nAs shown in Fig. 4b, the rupture propagated approximately 140 km from the epicenter to the southeast between the mainshock and the \n\nM\nw\n\n7.3\n\u2009\n aftershock, essentially parallel to the fault strike. The overall shape is similar to a \u201ccrocodile with an open mouth.\u201d Near the \n\nM\nw\n\n7.3\n aftershock, the ruptures that propagated to the north and southwest form a slip gap that is similar to the shape of a \u201ccrocodile with an open mouth\u201d (Shan et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2018). Yang (2019) calculated the Coulomb stress of the mainshock which increases in the slip gap. Most aftershocks that occurred in this area exhibited a complementary relationship between the aftershocks and the mainshock.\nThe predicted InSAR surface displacements agree well with the observations of the spatial distribution and motion magnitude (Fig. 5\n). The average residuals of Infs 1\u20134 are 5.6 cm, 6.1 cm, 5.9 cm, and 12 cm, respectively. The residual of Inf 4 is worse than the others, as in the results of Wang and Fialko (2015), because Sentinal-1A only imaged the uplifted area of the coseismic deformation field. The predicted GPS surface displacements are shown in Fig. 1 and are consistent with the GPS observations, particularly at the KKN4 and NAST stations, where the residuals are 1.2 cm and 1.4 cm respectively, accounting for approximately 1% of the observations. For the Chinese stations, the largest residual is 3 cm (station J041), while all other Chinese stations are less than 1 cm.\n\n\n5\nDiscussion\n\n5.1\nDislocation model\nWe also inverted the slip distribution using the steepest descent method (SDM, Wang et al., 2013) based on a rectangular dislocation source (Okada, 1985). The fault geometry parameters used for this inversion were the same as those in Section 3. The fault plane size was set as 200 km x 120 km and discretized into 10 km x 10 km sub-fault segments. The best coseismic slip distribution in the homogeneous elastic half-space model and the layered crust model were inverted (Fig. 6\n). The maximum slip of \u223c4.73 m in the homogeneous elastic half-space was located at a depth of \u223c10.25 km and the maximum slip of \u223c4.18 m using the layered crust model was located at a depth of \u223c10.25 km.\nWe found that the characteristics of the slip distribution based on a rectangular dislocation source and a triangular dislocation source are essentially the same. The rupture propagated from the epicenter to the southeast with a length of \u223c 140 km. Near the \n\nM\nw\n\n7.3\n aftershock, there is a trend of propagation along the strike and the dip of fault. However, there is more slip distribution detail in the triangular dislocation producing some differences in the estimated slip model between the two different sources: (1) the maximum slip of \u223c6.32 m in the triangular dislocation source is larger than the maximum slip of \u223c4.73 m and \u223c4.18 m in the rectangular dislocation source; (2) there are two peak slips in the triangular dislocation source; however, only one peak slip is present on the rectangular dislocation source; (3) the fitting value of the triangular dislocation source is better, the average InSAR and GPS residuals were 6.2 cm and 0.8 cm, respectively. For the rectangular dislocation source, the average InSAR and GPS residuals were 16.8 cm and 2.8 cm, respectively, in the homogeneous elastic half-space model. The average InSAR and GPS residuals were 16.1 cm and 2.6 cm, respectively, in the layered crust model.\n\n\n5.2\nGeometry of the main himalayan thrust\nIn this study, we used a simple planar fault in the model as do most studies. However, some researchers (Elliott et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016) have proposed a ramp \n-\n flat \n-\n ramp structure based on geodetic data, geological, and geophysical analyses. Therefore, we also used the geometry of the MHT from Elliott et al. (2016) to invert the slip distribution of the Nepal earthquake, shown in Fig. 7\n. The characteristics of the slip distribution using a ramp \n-\n flat \n-\n ramp fault structure are the same as a purely planar fault, in addition to a maximum slip of \u223c6.57 m. Significant slip is concentrated at the flat segment, while the two ramp segments have almost no slip. The GPS and InSAR residuals are also the same as the above results. Therefore, we agree with the conclusion of Qiu et al. (2016) that both single and multiple-segments are possiblenear Kathmandu.\n\n\n5.3\nRegularization\nWe also compared the effects of Laplacian regularization and minimum moment regularization. The results show that the maximum slip of \u223c6.5 m is located at a depth of \u223c9.7 km giving minimum moment regularization. The area of significant slip and the sub-fault of the fault plane become smaller than the slip modeling in Section 4 (Fig. 8\n). Five triangles in the slip distribution have slips greater than 5.5 m. However, these are scattered along the fault plane, causing obvious jumps and oscillations. The slip distribution, using a minimum moment regularization from McNamara et al. (2017), with the largest static slip magnitude of \u223c8 m is larger than most of the previous results; the fitting effect of the simulated displacement is not suitable enough. In contrast, the slip distribution using Laplacian regularization does not exhibit jumps or oscillations. The maximum slip and the area of significant slip are similar to previous results (Galetzka et al., 2015; Wang and Fialko, 2015), and the model fit residual is smaller. Therefore, we suggest using Laplacian regularization for this earthquake.\n\n\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn this study, a Bayesian approach and automated fault discretization based on triangular dislocation were used to invert the fault geometry parameters and coseismic slip distribution, respectively, of the Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, using InSAR and GPS data. The conclusions are as follows:\n\n(1)\nInterferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is primarily sensitive to vertical displacements. Consequently, the inversion of fault geometry in shallow dipping thrust faults is not suitable. We used only GPS data to invert the fault geometric parameters and determined a length of 99.92 \n-\n 101.33 km, width of 38.09 \n-\n 38.29 km, depth of 11.15 \n-\n 12.29 km, dip of 5.37 \n-\n 5.60\u00b0, and strike of 283.12 \n-\n 283.31\u00b0.\n\n\n(2)\nThe coseismic slip distribution of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake shows two slip peaks of 5.9 m and 6.32 m. Significant slip is concentrated between the mainshock and the Mw 7.3 aftershocks, essentially parallel to the strike direction of the fault, with an overall slip distribution shape similar to a \u201ccrocodile with an open mouth.\u201d The rupture propagated approximately 140 km along the fault strike and was restrained at 30 \n-\n 40 km along the dip direction to the north. Near the Mw 7.3 aftershock, the rupture propagated along the strike and dip of the fault with a structure similar to a \"crocodile mouth\", forming a large gap with 3 m of slip.\n\n\n(3)\nThe characteristics of slip distribution fora ramp \n-\n flat \n-\n ramp fault structure are the same as for a purely planar fault. Therefore, we postulate that both single and multiple-segments are possible near Kathmandu.\n\n\n(4)\nInversion of the fault slip distribution, using the minimum moment regularization will introduce jumps and oscillations in the slip distribution. This can be avoided by using Laplacian regularization, which produces better model fitting results.\n\n\n\n\n","64":"","65":"","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"","72":"","73":"","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"","81":"","82":"","83":"","84":"","85":"","86":"","87":"","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"","92":"","93":"","94":"","95":"","96":"","97":"","98":"","99":"","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"","119":""},"Creator":{"0":["Umeda, Kanta","Purevsuren, Nemekhbayar","Tsukada, Kazuhiro","Altansukh, Lodoidanzan","Nadmid, Bayart","Sodnom, Khishigsuren","Nuramkhaan, Manchuk","Kabashima, Taro","Kondo, Tomoyuki"],"1":["Huang, S.H.","Thybo, H.","Dong, S.W.","Artemieva, I.M.","He, R.Z.","Han, B.F.","Zhou, Q.","Shi, W."],"2":["Liu, Xianwen","Chen, Qiang","Yang, Yinghui","Xu, Qian","Zhao, Jingjing","Xu, Lang","Liu, Rong"],"3":["Naik, Sambit Prasanajit","Gwon, Ohsang","Park, Kiwoong","Bae, Sang Yeol","Shin, Hyeon-Cho","Choi, Jeong-Heon","Kim, Young-Seog"],"4":["Vl\u010dek, Josef","Ber\u00e1nek, Roman","Fischer, Tom\u00e1\u0161","Vilhelm, Jan"],"5":["Kassaras, Ioannis","Kapetanidis, Vasilis","Ganas, Athanassios","Karakonstantis, Andreas","Papadimitriou, Panayotis","Kaviris, George","Kouskouna, Vasiliki","Voulgaris, Nicholas"],"6":["Ma, Xuxuan","Attia, Snir","Cawood, Tarryn","Cao, Wenrong","Xu, Zhiqin","Li, Haibing"],"7":["Alessandretti, Luciano","Warren, Lucas Ver\u00edssimo"],"8":["Klyuchevskii, A.V.","Dem'yanovich, V.M.","Zuev, F.L.","Klyuchevskaya, A.A.","Kakourova, A.A.","Golovko, A.A."],"9":["Zhou, Zaizheng","Han, Zuozhen","Li, Sanzhong","Jiang, Zhaoxia","Li, Xiyao","Lan, Haoyuan"],"10":["Stephenson, Randell","Stovba, Sergiy"],"11":["Sahoo, Sambit","Tiwari, Deepak K.","Panda, Dibyashakti","Kundu, Bhaskar"],"12":["M\u00e1rton, Em\u0151","Tolji\u0107, Marinko","Cvetkov, Vesna"],"13":["Fonseca, Ana Carolina Liberal","Piffer, Gabriella Vago","Nachtergaele, Simon","Van Ranst, Gerben","De Grave, Johan","Novo, Tiago Am\u00e2ncio"],"14":["Yegorova, Tamara","Gobarenko, Valentina","Murovskaya, Anna"],"15":["Fuchs, Martin J.","Rexer, Moritz","Schaider, Florian"],"16":["Milia, Alfonsa","Torrente, Maurizio M."],"17":["Radhakrishna, T.","Bansal, B.K.","Ramakrishna, Ch."],"18":["Yao, Jinlong","Shu, Liangshu","Zhao, Guochun","Han, Yigui","Liu, Qian"],"19":["Chao, Peng","Manatschal, Gianreto","Chenin, Pauline","Ren, Jianye","Zhang, Cuimei","Pang, Xiong","Zheng, Jinyun","Yang, Linlong","Kusznir, Nick"],"20":["Toker, Mustafa","P\u0131nar, Ali","Ho\u015fkan, Nihan"],"21":["Navarrete, C\u00e9sar R.","Massaferro, Gabriela I.","Gianni, Guido A.","Lastra, Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n"],"22":["Tariq, M.
